The Rules, Forms and Schedules will provide a foundation for amultijurisdictional disclosure system (the ``system'') that can be expandedto encompass a wider class of issuers and be extended to additional jurisdictions.As currently proposed, the multijurisdictional disclosure system wouldpermit Canadian issuers that, depending on the nature of the offering,meet market value, public float and Canadian reporting history tests toregister securities in the United States using disclosure documents preparedaccording to the requirements of Canadian regulatory authorities. Issuersmeeting tests of market value and public float also would be able to usesuch documents to meet U.S. periodic disclosure requirements. Companiessubject to U.S. proxy requirements could use their Canadian documents forcertain solicitations. In addition, insiders of companies subject to Section16 of the Securities Exchange Act could meet the reporting requirementsby filing Canadian forms. The multijurisdictional disclosure system further would permit third-partyand issuer exchange and cash tender offers for securities issued by a Canadiancompany to be made in compliance with the provisions of applicable Canadiantender offer regulation where less than 20 percent of the class of securitiessubject to the offer were held of record by U.S. residents. Concurrently with the publication of this Release, the Ontario SecuritiesCommission and the Commission des valeurs mobilieres du Quebec are issuingfor comment proposals that would provide for the implemention of the multijurisdictionaldisclosure system in Canada and would permit U.S. issuers to make publicofferings and tender offers in Canada using disclosure documents preparedin accordance with Commission requirements.

Executive Summary </ITAG>Securities markets around the world are changing as foreign issuers expandtheir use of U.S. capital markets, domestic issuers increase their accessto foreign markets, and both debt and equity offerings are made multinationally.As a result of these offerings, the lines of demarcation between domesticand international capital markets are beginning to blur and domestic marketsare facing serious competition from a largely unregulated, transnationalfinancial market. Foreign issuers that consider direct access to the U.S. capital marketsthrough registered public offerings frequently are dissuaded by the substantialdifferences in disclosure standards, particularly with respect to accountingstandards. Because registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the ``SecuritiesAct'') \1\<NOTE/> brings with it a periodic reporting requirement under theSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''),\2\<NOTE/> a foreign issuer deciding whether to register securitiesalso must  consider the cost of incurring a continuing reporting obligation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.The Commission's challenge is to remove unnecessary impediments to transnationalcapital formation without unduly disadvantaging U.S. issuers in the U.S.markets, while ensuring that those buying securities in the U.S. capitalmarkets are afforded the protections intended by the Securities Act andthe Exchange Act. One such impediment is the fact that issuers making securitiesofferings across national boundaries may have to comply with the disclosurerequirements of two or more jurisdictions.\3\<NOTE/> Attempting to comply with the requirements of multiple jurisdictionsis expensive not only because of the cost of retaining local accountantsand lawyers, but also because of the additional time needed, since conditionsadvantageous to the issuer may prevail in the capital markets only fora limited period. Rather than comply with the requirements of regulatorsin more than one country, issuers may choose to exclude certain jurisdictionsfrom their offerings, thus excluding investors in that jurisdiction frominvestment opportunities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Commission has already made a number of accommodationsto foreign issuers in its disclosure standards. See section II.C. As an initial step towards addressing these issues, the   Commission in1985 issued a Concept Release \4\<NOTE/> requesting comments on two alternative methods of facilitatingmultijurisdictional offerings: The ``common prospectus approach'' and the``reciprocal prospectus approach.'' The common prospectus approach wouldrequire that participating jurisdictions agree upon a set of disclosurerequirements that would be the same in each jurisdiction, with the resultthat a prospectus prepared pursuant to the requirements of one participatingjurisdiction automatically would comply with the requirements of all otherparticipating jurisdictions. The reciprocal prospectus approach, on theother hand, would enable an issuer to prepare a disclosure document accordingto the requirements of its home jurisdiction, and to have that documentaccepted for securities offerings in every other participating jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Securities Act Release No. 6568, ``Facilitation of MultinationalSecurities Offerings'' (Feb. 28, 1985) (50 FR 9281) (the ``Concept Release'').A majority of commenters were of the opinion that although the common prospectusapproach might be ideal, the more workable system was represented by thereciprocal prospectus approach. The staff of the Commission thereafterbegan discussions with the staffs of the Ontario and Quebec securitiescommissions with a view toward establishing a multijurisdictional disclosuresystem. The system proposed   today is a hybrid between the reciprocalapproach and the common prospectus approach. Development of a multijurisdictional disclosure system between the UnitedStates and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec was a logical firststep in meeting the needs of transnational securities transactions. Canadahas mature capital markets with a strong regulatory tradition. The UnitedStates and Canada have the common goal of investor protection through refinedand developed disclosure systems for both the primary and secondary markets.Of particular significance is the extensive cooperation in enforcementmatters provided by the 1988 Memorandum of Understanding (``MOU'') withBritish Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. The MOU covers virtually the entirespectrum of cases which could arise under the federal securities laws,and provides a full range of assistance, including use of subpoena powerto compel the production of documents in furtherance of administrativeinvestigations. While each jurisdiction's requirements may differ in detail, they sharethe common purpose of ensuring that investors are given information adequateto permit them to make an informed investment decision, and an historicalreliance on disclosure as the principal protection of investors. Key toany system of disclosure is the application of accounting and auditingstandards, and Canada, like the United States, has highly developed accountingand auditing standards. The system proposed today would permit single-jurisdiction \5\<NOTE/> regulation of certain securities offerings and continuousreporting obligations, so that cross-border securities offerings couldbe made more efficiently and at less expense. The disclosure document foran offering would be prepared in accordance with the requirements of theissuer's home jurisdiction and the regulatory authorities of the home jurisdictionwould be responsible for establishing the applicable disclosure standards.Review of the disclosure document would be that customary in the issuer'shome jurisdiction. Issuers using the system would, however, continue tobe subject to provisions imposing civil or criminal liability for fraudin each jurisdiction where the securities were offered, if the offer wasmade through a material misrepresentation or omission in the disclosuredocument or there was fraud or manipulation in connection with the offering.Issuers would be subject to the authority of each such jurisdiction tohalt the offering in the public interest and for the protection of investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Public offerings in the United States are regulated atboth the federal and the state level. See section V. The system would cover registration of offerings by ``substantial'' Canadianissuers, all of which are eligible to use the Canadian integrated disclosuresystem, the Prompt   Offering Prospectus system. As an initial step, themultijurisdictional disclosure system would be limited to ``substantialissuers'' that could be assumed to have a large market following and theprices for whose securities reflect all available public information. Multijurisdictionalregistration also would be made available for certain rights and exchangeoffers, although more because of concerns for domestic investors' intereststhan for encouraging cross-border public offers. Foreign issuers makinga rights or exchange offer frequently do not extend offers to U.S. holdersbecause these issuers are unwilling to register securities with the Commission,thereby denying U.S. holders the opportunity to realize significant valueon their investment. Therefore, it appears in the interest of domesticinvestors to facilitate the registration of rights and exchange offersto encourage foreign issuers to extend such offers to U.S. investors. Relianceon home jurisdiction disclosure appears particularly appropriate whereU.S. investors do not own a substantial percentage of the foreign securities.\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ The tests for eligibility to use the system are discussedmore fully in section IV.C.In the case of offerings by substantial issuers of securities other thannon-convertible investment grade debt or non-convertible investment gradepreferred stock, reconciliation of financial statements to U.S. generallyaccepted accounting principles (``GAAP'') would be required. No reconciliationwould be required for investment grade securities, or in connection withrights or exchange offers. Qualification under the Trust Indenture Actof 1939 (the ``Trust Indenture Act'') \7\<NOTE/> of indentures relating to debt offerings would continue tobe required, but under rules proposed today use of Canadian trustees wouldbe permitted under specified conditions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 15 U.S.C. 77aaa-77bbbb. Transactions made in the United States pursuant to the multijurisdictionaldisclosure system may raise issues under certain anti-manipulation andother rules under the Exchange Act.\8\<NOTE/> The Commission's staff is proposing to take no-action positionsunder Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13 \9\<NOTE/> to permit specified purchases of securities outside the offeras permitted by Canadian law during tender and exchange offers made pursuantto the system. Moreover, the staff will consider the extent to which relieffrom these provisions is appropriate in connection with other transactionspursuant to the multijurisdictional disclosure system.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ See Exchange Act Release No. 21958 (April 18, 1985) (50FR 16302, 16308-09) (``Global Trading Release''). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 17 CFR 240.10b-6 and 240.10b-13. The multijurisdictional disclosure system also would extend to WilliamsAct regulations applicable to third-party and issuer exchange and cashtender offers made for the securities of Canadian issuers in compliancewith Canadian tender offer regulations, where less than 20 percent of theshares involved were held of record by U.S. residents. In the case of exchangeoffers, Canadian bidders would be permitted to use Canadian disclosurein the required registration statement if they met a (CN) $75 million marketcapitalization test and less than 20 percent of the shares subject to theoffer were held of record by U.S. residents. U.S. bidders in an exchangeoffer would continue to register the exchange offer on the standard  U.S. forms  (e.g.,  Form  S-1  or  S-4). The multijurisdictional disclosure system additionally would permit useof home jurisdiction periodic reporting forms to meet the reporting requirementsof the Exchange Act, where (a) such requirements arose solely by reasonof offerings registered on the forms proposed today, or (b) the issuerof the securities met tests of market value and reporting history. Withrespect to all Canadian issuers subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act,\10\<NOTE/> insider reports filed under Canadian law would suffice forExchange Act purposes. In addition, Canadian issuers subject to U.S. proxyregulations could rely on Canadian regulations and Canadian documents tomeet U.S. requirements in certain limited circumstances. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ 15 U.S.C. 78p.

Such proposals are published as an appendix to this Release.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background </ITAG>A. Developments in International Securities Markets In recent years, there has been substantial growth \12\<NOTE/> in both U.S. investors' purchases of foreign securities andofferings by U.S. issuers outside the United States. In 1988, gross transactionsby U.S investors in foreign corporate stocks totalled over $151 billion,representing almost nine times the total of such transactions in 1980.\13\<NOTE/> Gross U.S. transactions in foreign debt securities totalled$445 billion in 1988, reflecting a more than twelve-fold increase since1980. There are 150 foreign securities traded on U.S. securities exchanges,and 291 quoted in NASDAQ (99 in the National Market System). Many othersare traded over-the-counter. In all, the securities of over 2000 foreignissuers are traded in the United States.\14\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Eurobond offerings totalled $177.2 billion in 1988, $140.5billion in 1987, and $187.7 billion in 1986. Source: OECD Financial StatisticsMonthly (various issues). The value of international offerings of commonand preferred stocks in 1988 was $7.4 billion, down from the record totalin 1987 of $20.3 billion, but representing an increase over the total in1983 of $200 million. Source: Euromoney Bondware. International secondarymarkets are strong, too, with a total of 406 companies whose shares areactively traded in one or more foreign markets. ``The Corporate List,''Euromoney (May 1989). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Source: U.S. Treasury Bulletin (various issues). In 1987,a record total of over $189 billion was invested in foreign corporate stocksby U.S. investors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ This figure represents the 516 issuers that file periodicreports with the Commission under the Exchange Act and the 1488 issuersthat have established and are currently in compliance with the exemptionfrom such reporting provided by Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act (17CFR 240.12g3-2(b)). The securities of other foreign issuers are tradedoccasionally in the United States.Part of the growth in cross-border securities transactions has consistedof an increase in the number of offerings made simultaneously in two ormore countries, one of which may be the country of the issuer. Such offeringstypically are made when the size of the offering is such that it cannotbe absorbed by the issuer's domestic market (for example, in the case oflarge issuers from the comparatively small Scandinavian markets, or therecent British and French government privatizations), when the issuer desiresto expand the geographic base of its security holders, when the issuerwishes to increase the market for its securities internationally, or whenstrategic reasons exist (for example, to protect against takeover attempts).The issues raised by transnational capital formation became most apparentin the course of such multinational offerings, and were the impetus forthe Concept Release. The number of multinational offerings including a U.S. public tranche hasincreased significantly in recent years, due in large part to the increasein privatization offerings.\15\<NOTE/> The first such major offering was by British Petroleum CompanyPLC in l977. Since then, major public multinational offerings have increasedsignificantly, especially in connection with privatizations of variousforeign industries.\16\<NOTE/> The significance of the privatization offerings lies notonly in their increasing frequency and international impact, but also intheir enormous size.\17\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Problems associated with multinational offerings thatinvolve a public tranche in more than one country are discussed <T3>infra </T3>section II.C.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ British Telecommunications PLC conducted a $279 millionpublic offering in the United States in December 1984, simultaneously issuingsecurities in the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan. In December 1986, BritishGas PLC conducted a multinational offering of nearly 4 billion ordinaryshares, of which nearly 167 million were offered as American DepositaryShares in the United States. British Airways PLC offered 720 million sharespublicly in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada simultaneouslywith private offerings in Switzerland and Japan in February 1987. The latestBritish privatization involved the sale by British Steel PLC of 2 billionshares in simultaneous public offerings in the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates, Canada, Japan and Europe in December 1988. Also in December 1988,Hong Kong Telecommunications Limited offered over 877 million shares simultaneouslyin Hong Kong, the United States and an international offering. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ The portions of these offerings allocated to the UnitedStates tranches have been larger than those allocated to other countries.The U.S. tranches, however, have often amounted to a relatively small fractionof the domestic offerings in recent British and Hong Kong privatizations:British Telecom, United States tranche equalled 6.93 percent of the domesticoffering of 2,597,000,000 shares; British Gas, 4.75 percent of 3,505,386,339shares; British Airways, 10.82 percent of 582,518,707 shares; British Petroleum,49.11 percent of 1,030,000,000 shares; British Steel, 11.98 percent of1,502,000,000 shares; and Hong Kong Telecom, 29.75 percent of 607,500,000shares. Nevertheless, the United States tranches of these offerings werevalued at $278,928,000 in British Telecom, $319,608,807 in British Gas,$120,141,000 in British Airways, $2,549,653,500 in British Petroleum, $420,840,000in British Steel and $105,433,878 in Hong Kong Telecom.  In the past few years non-governmental companies also have made multinationalofferings involving a public U.S. tranche.\18\<NOTE/> Although these offerings usually are substantial in size,to date they have not been as large as the industry privatizations.\19\<NOTE/> They can be expected to continue to increase in size andnumber, especially in view of developments such as the creation of a singlemarket in Europe in 1992.\20\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\ <T3>E.g., </T3>Reuters Holdings PLC and Louis Vuitton S.A. in June 1984;Wellcome PLC in January 1986; Philips N.V. in May 1987; Banco Central,S.A. and Banco de Santander, S.A. de CreandCx.174;1dito in July 1987; RacalTelecom PLC in October 1988; and Pacific Dunlop Limited in May 1989. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\ The following amounts were involved in the U.S. tranchesof the above mentioned offerings: Reuters, $107,250,000; Louis Vuitton,$15,469,260; Wellcome, $72,332,000; Philips, $120,000,000; Banco Central,$152,000,000; Banco de Santander, $105,500,000; Racal Telecom, $129,489,300;and Pacific Dunlop, $128,000,000. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>``Europe Falls Behind in the Securities Race,'' <T3>Financial Times, </T3>section 1, p. 27 (Jan. 25, 1989). The size ofEuropean companies is likely to grow to meet the challenge of 1992. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>``Statute For the European Company,'' Commission Memorandumto Parliament (June 8, 1988). With increasing U.S. interest in and holding of foreign securities, theimpact of registration obligations and tender offer regulation on the willingnessof foreign issuers to extend rights and exchange offers or cash tenderoffers to U.S. shareholders has become increasingly significant. Frequently,U.S. investors are denied participation in such offers, or cashed out,because foreign issuers decide not to subject themselves to U.S. registrationand continuous reporting requirements. Consequently, while rights offersare very common in Europe \21\<NOTE/> and exchange offers are not uncommon in non-U.S. markets,rights and exchange offers by foreign companies into the United Statesare rare,\22\<NOTE/> while cash tender offers are much more frequent.\23\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ The existence of statutory preemptive rights for shareholdersin many countries, primarily in Europe, dictates that this method is themost common avenue for raising equity capital in those countries. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Companies Act 1985, sections 89(1), 90(6) (United Kingdom);Aktiengesetz (Stock Corporation Act), sections 179-221 (Federal Republicof Germany); Law No. 73-1196 of 27 December 1973, sections 178-180 (France).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ Foreign issuers have registered only 13 rights offeringsin the United States in the last three years. Foreign issuers (the majorityof which were Canadian) also registered only 13 exchange offers in theUnited States during the same period. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ While extensive information about the offeror is requiredwhere a foreign bidder issues securities, cash tender offers require lessdisclosure about the offeror since the public is not being offered a securityissued by that entity. However, substantial information is required regardingthe identity and plans of the offeror, recent transactions in the targetsecurities and the transaction contemplated. <T3>See</T3> Exchange Act 14(d) (15 U.S.C. 78n(d)); Rule 13e-4 (l7 CFR240.13e-4); Schedule 13E-4 (17 CFR 240.13E-101); Schedule 14D-1 (17 CFR240.14d-100). In the period from 1987 through 1988, there were 99 tenderoffers commenced by foreign bidders for shares in United States companies,of which 22 were hostile, 4 were neutral and 73 were friendly.B. CanadianIssuers in the United States Market Canadian companies are frequent issuers in the U.S. capital markets. In1987 and 1988, Canadian issuers made a total of 124 public offerings inthe United States, registering approximately $10 billion of securities,of which $8 billion was equity.\24\<NOTE/> Large Canadian multinational offerings have included, forexample, an offering in July 1987 by Gulf Canada Resources Limited. Thisoffering, which was part of a major reorganization of Gulf Canada Corp.,involved a Canadian tranche of 7.8 million shares for (CN) $175.5 million,a U.S. tranche of 6.6 million shares for (US) $111.3 million, and an internationaltranche of 5.6 million shares for (US) $94.5 million. Canadian companiesalso have made use of the U.S. shelf registration system. Over $1.7 billionin debt securities have been registered by Canadian issuers for sale underRule 415 in the last three years.\25\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ Convertible debt is included in equity figures. Thesefigures do not include offerings by Canadian governmental issuers. Thefigures include securities registered for ``flowback,'' (<T3>i.e., </T3>not targeted to the United States, but where a substantialU.S. market interest in the issuer's securities indicates that securitiesare likely to be sold in the United States shortly after issue). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ 17 CFR 230.415. Canadian governmental entities also usethe shelf registration system. In the last three years, 13 filings havebeen made by such entities for approximately $10.6 billion. Of the 516 foreign issuers filing periodic reports with the Commissionunder the Exchange Act, more than half are Canadian.\26\<NOTE/> As of June 30, 1989, there were 21 Canadian    issuers listedon the New York Stock Exchange, 38 on the American Stock Exchange and 146quoted in NASDAQ.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ The next most numerous groups of reporting issuers arefrom the United Kingdom (45) and Israel (27). C. Accommodations Made toForeign Issuers; Issues Raised by Multijurisdictional Offerings <ITAG tagnum="81">1.

In 1977, the Commission adopted a new form, Form 20-F, for registrationstatements and annual reports filed under the Exchange Act.\28\<NOTE/> This form may be used by non-Canadian foreign private issuersand Canadian issuers that are not listed on a U.S. securities exchangeand have not offered their securities publicly in the United States. Althoughthe form requires substantial disclosure by foreign private issuers, itmakes several concessions based on a recognition of foreign disclosurepractices. The form permits preparation of financial statements in accordancewith GAAP in the registrant's home country, with reconciliation to U.S.GAAP attached thereto.\29\<NOTE/> The form also calls for less detail regarding related-partytransactions than is required for domestic registrants,\30\<NOTE/> and management remuneration may be presented on an aggregatebasis.\31\<NOTE/> Additionally, the time frame for filing annual reports onForm 20-F is designed to accommodate foreign issuers.\32\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ 17 CFR 249.220f.

In theUnited Kingdom, the price of the issue is set on ``Impact Day,'' followedimmediately by publication of the prospectus and commencement of the offeringperiod. After the offering period, allotments are made according to subscriptionsreceived during the offering period (``Allotment Day''). In the UnitedStates, the offering period occurs prior to pricing pursuant to a preliminaryprospectus. Thus a choice must be made by the underwriters and the issuer:Either the U.K. offering must proceed without a U.S. underwriting commitmentin place, or the U.S. syndicate must commit itself to the deal far in advanceof being able to set a public offering price or being able actually tosell the securities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ Canadian underwriting and marketing procedures do notdiffer significantly from those in the United States.

Of course,such activities also may raise issues under the general antifraud provisionsof the securities laws <T3>e.g</T3>., Section 17(a) of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77q(a)) andRule 10b-5 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR 240.10b-5).In an increasing number of contexts, the Commission has crafted relieffrom these and other applicable Exchange Act provisions in order to accommodatethe structure and regulatory pattern of foreign jurisdictions, and to permitnon-U.S. distribution participants to continue certain customary activitiesin foreign markets.\51\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ For example, the ISE Letter contained exemptions fromRules 10b-6 and 10b-7 to permit ISE member broker-dealers to engage in``passive market making'' on the ISE, where ISE member firms participatedin a multinational distribution of securities of certain U.K. issuers partiallybeing offered in the U.S., or where such firms were affiliated with U.S.broker-dealers participating in a distribution of such securities in theU.S. Under Rule 10b-6, such ISE firms would have had to cease market-makingactivities during specified periods during the distribution. <T3>See </T3>Rule 10b-6(a)(4)(xi). <T3>See also supra </T3>n. 47. In permitting ``passive market making''as described in the ISE Letter, U.K. firms could provide depth and liquidityto the U.K. market while minimizing any potential manipulative impact onthe U.S. markets. The exemptive relief recognized the highly developedregulatory structure of the ISE and was subject to several conditions andspecifically designed to avoid a manipulative impact on the U.S. market.<ITAG tagnum="28">Similar exemption letters have been issued in other contexts. </ITAG><T3>See, e.g., </T3>``Letter Regarding Banco de Santander, S.A.'' (July28, 1987), (1987 Decisions) Fed. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) andpara;78,523, at 77,684and (1987-1988 Decisions) Fed. Sec. L. Rep.

The multijurisdictional disclosure system was designed to mitigate theproblems posed by multinational offerings. Canada is the first partnerfor the United States in this effort because of the sophistication of itsmarkets, and the   similarities between U.S. and Canadian securities laws,in terms of both their investor protection mandate and the structure ofthe regulatory scheme established to effect that mandate. D. Mutual Recognition and Harmonization Efficiency of the capital-raising process would be enhanced greatly bypermitting an issuer to prepare one disclosure document for use in eachjurisdiction in which it chooses to sell securities. There are two primaryapproaches to achieve this goal: Harmonization of disclosure standardsworldwide and mutual recognition of disclosure standards established inother countries. The multijurisdictional registration system proposed todayincludes aspects of both of these approaches. Under a harmonization approach, participating jurisdictions would agreeupon a set of disclosure requirements that would be the same in each jurisdiction,with the result that a prospectus prepared pursuant to the requirementsof one participating jurisdiction would comply automatically with the requirementsof all other participating jurisdictions. In addition to reducing costs,a prime benefit of such a system would be providing comparability of informationfrom issuer to issuer and country to country.\52\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ The European Community has taken steps toward harmonizationof securities disclosure and accounting requirements among its member countries.The first step toward harmonization is the adoption of basic standardsof disclosure to be adopted by all member countries. While member statesmay add additional requirements for domestic issuers, they must recognizeand accept the compliance of other member states' issuers with their homecountry requirements. <T3>See, </T3>for example, Preamble to Council Directive of March 17, 1980(80/390/EEC) (relating to listing particulars). (``[w]hereas (disclosure)differences should be eliminated by coordinating the rules and regulationswithout necessarily making them completely uniform, in order to achievean adequate degree of equivalence in the safeguards required in each MemberState to ensure the provision of information which is sufficient and asobjective as possible for actual or potential security holders * * *'').<ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>See also </T3>Proposed Directive on the Requirements for Prospectuses(COM (80) 895) (relating to prospectuses for public offers), which wouldrequire mutual acceptance of prospectuses by member countries. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><T3>See </T3>generally, on the subject of reciprocity and mutual recognitionin the European Community, ``Completing the Internal Market'', White Paperfrom the Commission to the European Council (June 28-29, 1985), articles101-104; and Third Report from the Commission to the Council and the EuropeanParliament (March 21, 1988), article 49. Mutual recognition, on the other hand, would enable an issuer to preparea disclosure document according to the requirements of its home jurisdiction,and to have that document accepted for securities offerings in every otherparticipating jurisdiction.\53\<NOTE/> Mutual recognition may sacrifice comparability in order tofacilitate the offering process.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Memorandum of Understanding between the Governmentof Australia and the Government of New Zealand on Harmonization of BusinessLaw, July 1, 1988. This Memorandum noted the establishment of a programto examine, <T3>inter alia, </T3>harmonization of regulatory practices and cross-recognitionof prospectuses.  As proposed, the multijurisdictional disclosure system is a hybrid of thetwo approaches. While it is based on the concept of mutual recognition,the participants will be those jurisdictions whose disclosure systems,while different in detail, provide investors with information to make aninformed investment decision and financial statements of relevance andreliability. The existence of a well-developed, sophisticated and reliablesystem for administering these requirements is also critical, as the Commissionwill rely on foreign definitions and application of disclosure standards,and day-to-day enforcement of those standards. The Commission recognizes that the success of the multijurisdictional approachis contingent upon the ability of the relevant regulators to enforce effectivelytheir securities laws as applied to cross-border securities offerings.As a result, in the Commission's view, Memoranda of Understanding,\54\<NOTE/> which provide mechanisms for comprehensive cooperation andenforcement assistance among regulators, are a key component of this approach.The SEC's MOU with British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec exemplifies sucha comprehensive mechanism.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Memoranda of Understanding (``MOUs'') are formal understandingsbetween the Commission and foreign governments or foreign securities authoritieswhich provide for the sharing of information in Commission and foreignagency investigations and litigation. Although MOUs are not binding agreementsunder international law, they serve as statements of intent between like-mindedregulators to provide mutual assistance and cooperation in a variety ofmatters. MOUs formalize methods for requesting and providing informationin connection with Commission and foreign agency efforts to administerand enforce their respective securities laws, and provide the Commissionwith direct access to information held or obtained by a counterpart ina foreign country. <ITAG tagnum="28">For example, on January 7, 1988, the Commission signed a Memorandumof Understanding (the ``Canadian MOU'') with the British Columbia SecuritiesCommission, the OSC, and the CVMQ, concerning mutual cooperation in mattersrelating to the administration and enforcement of U.S. and Canadian securitieslaws. The Canadian MOU contemplates that the United States and Canadianregulators will provide comprehensive assistance to each other in orderto facilitate the administration and enforcement of the full range of laws,regulations and regulatory policies of the United States and Canada concerningsecurities matters, including specifically disclosure obligations relatingto the issuance of securities. Such assistance includes providing accessto information in the files of each securities authority and obtainingcompulsory testimony and production of documents. The Canadian MOU recognizesthat, at the time it was signed, a signatory may not have had the authorityto provide such assistance, and the signatories undertook to seek to obtainthat authorization if necessary. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Section 21(a)(2) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78u(a)(2)), whichwas added on November 19, 1988, pursuant to the Insider Trading and SecuritiesFraud Enforcement Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-704, provides the necessaryauthority for the Commission to implement fully the provisions of the CanadianMOU. This section allows the Commission to provide assistance to foreignsecurities authorities to determine whether violations of a foreign country'ssecurities laws have occurred, are occurring, or are about to occur. TheCommission can provide this assistance regardless of whether the matterunder investigation in the foreign country also would be a violation ofU.S. law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The Provinces of British Columbia and Quebec also have passed legislationproviding the necessary authority for their respective securities authoritiesto implement fully the provisions of the Canadian MOU, and it is the staff'sunderstanding that the OSC soon will submit similar legislation in Ontario.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">III.

C. Accounting; Auditing Canada's public accountants (primarily designated as chartered accountants)are licensed to practice by provincial statute. Authoritative accountingand auditing standards, which are uniform across Canada, are developedby a national body, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (``CICA'').Separate provincial institutes establish rules pertaining to professionalconduct and ethics. Although promulgated auditing standards in Canada differ from U.S. standardsin some respects, generally accepted practice in Canada routinely encompassesall significant auditing procedures required by U.S. standards. Further,CICA periodically evaluates new auditing standards adopted by the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants (``AICPA''), CICA's U.S. counterpart,to determine whether similar guidelines may be appropriate for Canadianauditors. CICA reporting standards comply with the reporting requirements specifiedby Article 2 of Regulation S-X,\101\<NOTE/> but differ from the AICPA's reporting standards. While AICPAstandards require U.S. auditors to include an explanatory paragraph intheir report if substantial doubts exist about an entity's continued existenceor there are other material uncertainties, the Canadian auditor is prohibitedfrom including such a reference in the audit report if the matter is disclosedadequately in a note to the financial statements. However, CICA has publisheda guideline intended to apply where the report is to be included in a filingwith the Commission. The guideline indicates that the auditor should addcomments for U.S. readers explaining the conflict in reporting standardsand providing a cross-reference to the relevant uncertainty or other considerationdisclosed in the financial statements. Compliance with this guidance wouldbe required specifically in filings made pursuant to the multijurisdictionalsystem.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\101\ 17 CFR 210.2-01 through 210.2-05.

Canada's federal and provincial takeover laws impose on third-party biddersand target management detailed disclosure requirements that closely resemblethose prescribed by the Williams Act.

The Proposed System </ITAG>A. Overview; Purpose The multijurisdictional disclosure system proposed today would permit publicoffers to be made in the United States on the basis of disclosure documentsprepared in accordance with Canadian law. The system would cover multijurisdictionaland cross-border offerings by Canadian issuers that met specified sizetests, in order to encourage cross-border public offers and facilitatethe free flow of capital. The system also would cover specified rightsand exchange offers in order to encourage Canadian issuers to extend suchoffers to U.S. shareholders.  The multijurisdictional disclosure system also would permit tender offersthat are primarily Canadian in character to comply with the provisionsof the Williams Act by complying with the applicable Canadian tender offerregulations, again to encourage such offers to be made to U.S. investors.Given the extensive Canadian regulatory provisions, the United States doesnot have an overriding investor protection interest in insisting on compliancewith the specific regulatory provisions of Regulations 14D and 14E. The multijurisdictional disclosure system likewise would extend to continuousreporting, in light of Canada's continuous reporting requirements providinginvestor protection comparable to that provided by the similar U.S. requirements,as discussed above, and the likelihood that facilitation of the registrationprocess without extension to the reporting process would render the systemof little utility. Under the multijurisdictional disclosure system as it would operate inCanada, U.S. issuers would be able to make public offerings of securitiesin all provinces of Canada on the basis of prospectuses prepared in accordancewith U.S. law. Such prospectus disclosure would be updated in accordancewith U.S. requirements, and U.S. documents would be used to comply withcontinuous reporting requirements. Although Ontario currently does nothave a concept of shelf registration, procedures will be proposed by theOSC staff to accommodate U.S. issuers making shelf offerings. Tender offersthat are primarily U.S. in character would be deemed to comply with applicableCanadian regulations if they were conducted in accordance with the provisionsof the Williams Act. In proposing adoption of the system, the Commission and Canadian securitiesauthorities are taking a conservative first step rather than providingfor multijurisdictional registration and disclosure in all cases. The firstphase of the system will enable the Commission and the Canadian authoritiesto monitor use of the system and to address potential problems. At a laterdate, a wider variety of transactions and a greater number of issuers maybe added. To be eligible to participate in the multijurisdictional system, an issuerwould be required to have a three-year reporting history with either theOSC or the CVMQ,\145\<NOTE/> and to be in compliance with the reporting requirements ofsuch authorities at the time of filing. Issuers also would be required,except in the case of rights offerings, to meet tests of minimum marketvalue or public float. The system further would permit compliance withCanadian law to suffice for compliance with the Williams Act in the caseof tender offers made for the securities of Canadian issuers, a limitedpercentage of which is held by U.S. residents.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\145\ lssuers of rights and exchange offers would be requiredto have listed securities on the ME or TSE for the three years prior tothe offering. Pursuant to OSC and CVMQ rules, they thus would have beenreporting to the OSC for that period. <T3>See </T3>OSA section 1(1)(38); QSA andSection; 68. The forms requiresubstantial issuers to have a three-year reporting history with any Canadianauthority, but the size tests for use of Forms F-9 and F-10 are such thateligible issuers most likely would be reporting to the OSC or CVMQ. Audits conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standardsin Canada would be accepted in the United States pursuant to the multijurisdictionalsystem. Auditor independence requirements would not be affected by themultijurisdictional process and accountants therefore must continue tomeet the independence requirements of the jurisdiction in which an offeris made. Moreover, Canadian auditors would be required specifically tofollow the existing Canadian professional guidelines\146\<NOTE/> regarding additional comments for U.S. readers that may beappropriate with respect to contingencies and going-concern considerations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\146\ <T3>See </T3>CICA Auditing Guideline, ``Canada-United States reportingconflict with respect to contingencies and going concern considerations''(December 1988). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Offerings by Substantial Issuers </ITAG>The purpose of the ``substantial'' designation is to single out issuerswhose size is such that the market operates efficiently for them.\147\<NOTE/> Such issuers generally have a wide market following and themarketplace can be expected to have set a price for their securities basedon all publicly available information. As in the case of determining theavailability of Form S-3 or F-3, the Commission has distinguished betweeninvestment grade and other securities in determining whether to rely completelyon Canadian disclosure, although a size test would be applied to investmentgrade debt offerings (which is not the case for offerings on Forms F-3or S-3). In the context of investment grade debt and preferred stock, a``substantial'' issuer is defined as one that has a market value of atleast (CN) $180 million, as opposed to the (CN) $360 million required inthe case of other securities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\147\ <T3>Compare </T3>Securities Act Release No. 6331 (August 6, 1981), adoptingForm S-3 (``Because these registrants are widely followed, the disclosureset forth in the prospectus may appropriately be limited, without the lossof investor protection, to information concerning the offering and materialfacts which have not been disclosed previously.''). The Commission is proposing to rely entirely on Canadian disclosures inthe case of investment grade debt and preferred stock. These securitiesgenerally trade on the basis of the yield on such securities and assessmentsof their creditworthiness. The financial information pertaining to liquidityand capital resources is most relevant to this investment decision, andthe differences between U.S. and Canadian GAAP usually are not of suchmagnitude as to affect materially an assessment of this information withrespect to the ability to repay principal and interest when due. In the case of offerings by substantial issuers of securities other thaninvestment grade debt and preferred stock, reconciliation to U.S. GAAPwould be required. While the financial statements prepared in accordancewith Canadian GAAP are relevant and reliable, financial statement reconciliationwould increase comparability of financial information, which is of greaterimportance to investment decisions with respect to equity and other non-investmentgrade securities.The Commission specifically requests comment as to whether the differencesbetween U.S. and Canadian accounting standards are sufficient to warrantcontinued reconciliation requirements, or whether Canadian financial statementswould provide investors with adequate information for comparative analysispurposes in some or all cases. If reconciliation is not necessary in allcases, should it be required only for specific regulated industries (forexample, insurance companies, where specialized industry guidance in bothcountries may result in very different balance sheets) or specific transactions?The Commission also requests comment as to whether domestic issuers wouldbe disadvantaged unduly if Canadian issuers were to be permitted to sellnoninvestment grade debt or equity in the United States without reconciliation.Depending on the responses received to these questions, the Commissionmay reconsider the need to require reconciliation, and could eliminateor modify that requirement in Form F-10. In the case of banks registering securities on proposed Form F-10, supplementaldisclosure of specified portions of the information prescribed by SecuritiesAct Industry Guide 3, discussed below, also would be required. Review byCommission staff of applicable Canadian law indicated that equivalent disclosurecurrently is not required in Canada. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rights and Exchange Offers </ITAG>The multijurisdictional registration process also would be extended tocertain rights and exchange offers, primarily because of concerns for domesticinvestors' interests. Rights and exchange offers made in the United Statesgenerally must be registered with the Commission.\148\<NOTE/> As noted above, foreign issuers making a rights or exchangeoffer frequently do not extend offers to U.S. holders because they areunwilling to bear the costs and other burdens of registering securitiesin the United States.\149\<NOTE/> U.S. holders of securities that are the subject of a rightsoffering are typically ``cashed out'' and thereby may be denied the opportunityto realize significant value on their investments.\150\<NOTE/> In the case of exchange offers, investors are relegated eitherto selling into the market at less than the full tender offer considerationand incurring transactional costs not imposed in the tender offer or remainingminority shareholders, subject to the risk of being cashed out in a subsequentmerger or arrangement subject to Canadian corporate law.\151\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\148\ Rights offers generally are not required to be registeredunder state law. <T3>See </T3>section 402(14), Uniform Securities Act (1985), Official CodeComment, n.14. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\149\ To avoid filing a registration statement in the UnitedStates, Canadian exchange offerors may restrict U.S. shareholders to receivingcash. <T3>See, e.g., Alberta Energy Ltd. </T3>(avail.

Nov. 29, 1979). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\150\ <T3>See </T3>letter to the Commission from the College Retirement EquityFund, April 22, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\151\ In adopting the All Holders, Best Price Rule requiringthat tender offers be made to all holders of the class of securities subjectto a tender offer and on identical terms (Rule 14d-10(a); Rule 13e-4(f)(8)),the Commission stated that the new rules would not require foreign biddersto extend offers to target shareholders residing in the United States.Exchange Act Release No. 23421, <T3>supra </T3>n.127. If a foreign offeror uses the jurisdictional meansof the United States (<T3>see, e.g., Consolidated Gold Fields PLC </T3>v. <T3>Minorco S.A., </T3>871 F.2d 252 (2d Cir. 1989)), however, the offermust be made to U.S. shareholders on the same terms as other target shareholders.Rather than create a specific exception to the Rule's requirement thatall alternative forms of consideration be offered to all shareholders when(a) a foreign bidder makes an exchange offer to non-U.S. shareholders butwishes to offer only cash to U.S. shareholders (<T3>see supra</T3> n.149), or (b) a U.S. bidder wishes to make an exchangeoffer to U.S. shareholders and a cash-only offer to nonresident foreignshareholders, the Commission indicated in the adopting release that itwould consider applications for exemptive relief under Rules 14d-10(e)or 13e-4(g)(7) (17 CFR 240.13e-4(g)(7)) on a case-by-case basis. Pursuantto delegated authority, the Commission's Division of Corporation Financehas granted exemptive relief to a Canadian bidder that excluded U.S. shareholdersof the Canadian target due to a Canadian law prohibiting foreign ownership.<T3>Alberta Energy Co. Ltd. </T3>(June 19, 1989). In addition, the Divisionhas granted exemptive relief to a U.S. company that excluded Canadian shareholdersof the U.S. target because U.S. law prohibited foreign ownership of domesticoil and gas leases. <T3>Freeport-McMoran Energy Partners, Ltd. </T3>(June 19, 1989). Exemptiverelief was denied in connection with a tender offer by a Canadian corporationfor 78 percent of the common stock of a Canadian affiliate of a U.S. company,where the bidder proposed to offer cash only to U.S. target shareholders,and the choice of cash or stock to Canadian target shareholders, but didnot argue that Canadian law foreclosed U.S. ownership of target stock.<T3>Imperial Oil Ltd.</T3> (June 19, 1989).It therefore would appear to be in the interests of domestic investorsto facilitate the registration of such offerings to encourage foreign issuersto include domestic shareholders. Particularly when U.S. holdings are small,Canadian issuers currently find that the costs of extending these offersinto the United States outweigh the benefits of such entry. The proposedsystem should alter the costbenefit analysis made by Canadian issuers infavor of extending offers to relatively small numbers of securities holdersin the United States. Additionally, imposing a duplicative cost on issuers seems particularlyinappropriate where the effect on the United States is incidental to atransaction. For this reason, where less than 20 percent of the class ofsecurities to which the rights or exchange offer related is held of recordby U.S. residents, offers could be made in the United States pursuant tothe system. The percentage of record holders would be determined as ofthe end of the issuer's last quarter or, if such quarter ended within 60days prior to the date of filing, as of the end of the preceding quarter.Comment is requested as to whether the percentage should be determinedas of a different date. Rights offerings to U.S. investors that already own the securities of theissuer are particularly appropriate for multijurisdictional registration.Investors already holding the securities can be expected reasonably tomake a further investment based on the same type of information on whichthey relied when they bought the securities in the secondary market. Consistentwith this theory, multijurisdictional registration for rights offeringswould be made available to a larger class of issuers than those designated``substantial.'' For the same reason, however, the rights so registeredcould not be transferred to investors in the United States who were notalready shareholders. Comment is requested as to whether rights offers should be permitted tobe made pursuant to the system in the event more than 20 percent of thesubject securities were held of record by U.S. residents. For example,should the limit be 30, 40 or 50 percent or should there be no limit atall? In the case of exchange offers, it similarly seems appropriate to facilitateregistration so that domestic investors are not denied rights of valuethat are offered to all other holders of the same class of securities.On the other hand, in non-issuer exchange offers, unlike rights offerings,the investor has not made a prior investment decision with respect to thebidder whose securities are being offered in the exchange. Due to thisdifference, eligibility standards for exchange offers would be higher thanthose applicable to rights offerings, and a narrower class of exchangeoffers could be made through the multijurisdictional system. While issuersof both rights and exchange offers would have to have three-year reportinghistories, only in exchange offers would issuers be required to have apublic float of (CN) $75 million.\152\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ This requirement is derived from the requirements ofCanada's Prompt Offering Qualification system. <T3>See </T3><T3>supra </T3>Section III.B. In the case of exchange offers, a decision to extend offers to U.S. investorsdepends not only on the application of U.S. disclosure requirements, butalso on U.S. tender offer regulation. Foreign issuers conducting tenderoffers for the shares of Canadian target companies often are deterred fromextending both exchange and cash offers to target shareholders residingin the United States by costs attendant to compliance with this country'sapplicable tender offer regulations,\153\<NOTE/> and thus exclude U.S. investors from their tender offers.In some cases, although purporting to exclude U.S. shareholders from theoffer, the bidder in fact may have intended that U.S. holders sell intothe market so that the shares could be purchased on the open market bythe bidder, as permitted under Canadian law,\154\<NOTE/> or tendered by Canadians who purchased such shares in themarket. Rather than protecting U.S. investors, the application of tenderoffer rules under the U.S. regulatory scheme to predominantly Canadiantender offers can operate to deny these investors the full benefit of participationin such transactions. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\153\ A particular deterrent arises from differences in theminimum offering period. Canadian law requires that tender offers remainopen only for 21 calendar days, whereas the Williams Act prescribes a minimumoffering period of 20 business days. <T3>See supra </T3>section III.D. Participation of U.S. shareholders likewisemay not be sought due to cost considerations involved in making tenderoffer filings under U.S. law, including reconciliation of financial statementsto U.S. GAAP. <T3>See supra </T3>section II.C. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ <T3>See infra </T3>nn. 206-208.In sum, the multijurisdictional system should reduce disincentives to theinclusion of U.S. shareholders in predominantly Canadian cash or exchangeoffers where less than 20 percent of the subject class was held of recordby U.S. residents. More importantly, because the substantive protectionsand disclosure obligations established by Canada's tender offer regulationsare comparable to those prescribed by the Williams Act and the Commission'srules thereunder, holders of shares in Canadian companies residing  inthe United States would not be disadvantaged unduly by comparison withU.S. shareholders in domestic companies. To minimize any potential regulatoryinequality, the nationality of a bidder in a cash tender offer would notdetermine availability of the system. Thus U.S. and Canadian bidders fora Canadian target would be governed by the same tender offer regulation.B. The Mechanics of the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System An issuer using the multijurisdictional disclosure system would preparea disclosure document according to the requirements of its home jurisdictionand use that document for securities or cash offerings in the United States.Review of the disclosure document generally would be that customary inCanada, and the Canadian regulatory authorities would be responsible forapplying disclosure standards. Thus, except in the unusual case where theCommission staff had reason to believe there was a problem with the filingor the offering, the documents generally would be given a ``no review''status. Although Canadian issuers offering securities pursuant to the systemwould not be required to comply with U.S. disclosure requirements, theynonetheless would be liable under U.S civil liability and antifraud provisions\155\<NOTE/> and, with respect to securities offerings, subject to theauthority of the Commission to stop the offering in the public interestand for the protection of investors.\156\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\155\ Sections 11, 12(2) and 17(a) of the Securities Act,sections 10(b), 14(e) and 18 of the Exchange Act, and Rules 10b-5, 13e-4(b)(1)and 14e-3 under this Act. In essence, the Commission is proposing the adoptionof the disclosure provisions of the Canadian forms, and omission of informationotherwise generally included in Commission forms would not violate U.S.disclosure requirements. However, an antifraud action could be broughtalleging that the document was misleading because information had beenomitted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\156\ <T3>See </T3>section 8 of the Securities Act (15 U.S.C. 77h).  The system would distinguish between the disclosure document required tobe given to each investor and the documents to be filed with the Commission.Participating Canadian issuers could provide investors in the United Stateswith the same information delivered to investors in Canada. Informationincorporated by reference in the prospectus would not be required to bedistributed to investors, but would be filed with the Commission.\157\<NOTE/> Investors would be able to obtain such information from theCommission or, upon request, from the issuer.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\157\ Such documents would be part of the prospectus and subjectto liability under section 12(2) of the Securities Act for any misleadingstatement.All exhibits to the Canadian prospectus, takeover bid circular or otherdocument, including those incorporated by reference, would be requiredto be filed with the Commission as part of the registration statement orschedule.  Documents already filed with the Commission would not be required to befiled again. Experts' consents filed with the Commission as a part of aregistration statement would be required to indicate clearly that the consentto use the experts' statements and consents extends to all the documentsbeing filed with the Commission which attribute a report or opinion tothe expert.\158\<NOTE/> Thus, all the documents would be subject to Section 11 liabilityand all other provisions of the U.S. securities laws applicable to a registrationstatement filed under the Securities Act, as well as (in the case of tenderoffers) the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act. Moreover, such documentswould be in the Commission's public files, available for public review.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\158\ <T3>See </T3>Securities Act Rules 436-439 (17 CFR 230.436-439). Participating issuers could use a brief ``wraparound'' form or scheduleto register their offerings with, or otherwise provide disclosure to, theCommission. This form or schedule would give the issuer's name and address,and that of its agent for service in the United States, include the prospectusor offering circular, and list the exhibits filed, including documentsincorporated by reference, with the Commission. Each form and scheduleproposed today contains a requirement that the Commission be advised ofany change to the name or address of an agent.\159\<NOTE/> All the forms and schedules proposed also expressly requirethat the issuer add to the prospectus or circular legends warning investorsthat the investment may have tax consequences in the issuer's jurisdiction,that investors may have to pursue remedies for any securities law violationagainst persons and assets located in the issuer's jurisdiction, and thatany financial statements are prepared in accordance with Canadian accountingstandards.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\159\ This would codify staff interpretations to the effectthat such notification is necessary. The forms and schedules would be accompanied by a Form F-X, which includesnot only a consent to service of process and appointment of a U.S. personas agent for process, but also a consent to service of an administrativesubpoena and an undertaking to assist the Commission with administrativeinvestigations.\160\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\160\ Proposed Form F-X.  Where debt securities were registered, issuers would be required to complywith the Trust Indenture Act, and would file as exhibits to the registrationstatement a copy of the trust indenture \161\<NOTE/> and the statement of eligibility on Form T-1.\162\<NOTE/> In the event that the registrant intended to use a non-U.S.trustee, it also would have to provide information regarding that trusteeor incorporate by reference the application form previously used to obtaina waiver of the U.S. trustee requirement. The procedure for applicationfor waiver is discussed in detail below.\163\<NOTE/> If any exchange or tender offer for debt securities wereregistered on Form F-8, pursuant to section 306(c) of the Trust IndentureAct, offers could not be made until an indenture (including the relatedstatement(s) of eligibility and qualification of the trustee or trustees)had been filed for qualification with the Commission.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\161\ 17 CFR 229.601(b)(4)(i) and (iv). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\162\ 17 CFR 229.601(b)(26). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\163\ <T3>See infra </T3>section IV.G. Registration statements on the proposed forms must be filed with the Commissionon the same day as the filing of a prospectus or other document with thesecurities authorities of the jurisdiction identified by the registranton the cover of the form as the principal jurisdiction regulating the offering.Any amendment to the document filed with that jurisdiction similarly mustbe filed on the same day with the Commission under cover of a post-effectiveamendment. Because the provincial securities commission must review andapprove all prospectuses and related documents prior to effectiveness exceptthose incorporated in exchange offer filings,\164\<NOTE/> these registration statements and amendments would be deemedeffective on the date the securities could legally be sold in the principalCanadian jurisdiction.\165\<NOTE/> With respect to exchange offers, which may commence immediatelyin Canada upon dissemination of offering documents to target company shareholders,filings on Form F-8 would become effective upon filing with the Commission.\166\<NOTE/> Post-effective amendments to proposed Forms F-7 through F-10also would become effective on the date on which the securities legallymay be sold in the principal Canadian jurisdiction.\167\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\164\ <T3>See supra </T3>section III.B. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\165\ Proposed Rule 467(a). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\166\ <T3>Id. See supra </T3>n. 123 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\167\ <T3>Id.  </T3>In the case of a U.S.-only offering on Forms F-9 and F-10, the registrationstatement would be made effective on the date specified by the registrant,but in no event less than seven days after the registration statement wasfiled with the Commission.\168\<NOTE/> This seven-day period corresponds to the average time thatis required for a registration statement to be reviewed in Canada. It wouldprovide adequate time for Canadian authorities to advise the Commissionof any regulatory concerns and would minimize any potential for the proposedsystem to encourage Canadian issuers to forego qualification in Canada.The Commission specifically requests comment as to whether the proceduresoutlined in this Release are likely to result in Canadian issuers thatwould otherwise have offered securities in Canada choosing to offer onlyin the United States. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\168\ Proposed Rule 467(b). In the case of a debt offering, the trust indenture relating to the securitieswould be qualified when the registration statement became effective. Theregistration statement would not be deemed effective, however, in any casewhere either all the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act had not beencomplied with, or an appropriate exemption had not been obtained from thoseprovisions with which the registrant had not complied.Registrants on the multijurisdictional forms would be able to make a delayedor continuous offering to the same extent foreign private issuers currentlymay make such offerings pursuant to Rule 415. However, prospectus updatingwould be accomplished in compliance with Canadian law.\169\<NOTE/> Any updated prospectus would be filed with the Commissionas a post-effective amendment and would be declared effective on the dateon which the securities legally may be sold in the principal Canadian jurisdiction.A registration statement for a delayed or continuous offering could befiled with the Commission if the documents contained in the registrationstatement included the documents required in Canada and complied with allCanadian requirements. In the case of offerings made in both Canada andthe United States, the registrant would comply with Canadian law regardingprospectus updating, and no special undertaking would be required in theregistration statement.\170\<NOTE/> In the event there was no contemporaneous offering in Canada,the registrant would be required to enter into an undertaking regardingprospectus updating.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\169\ Canadian law requires a prospectus to be amended toreflect any material change in the information contained therein.

Application of the Systemto Specific Transactions Discussed in detail below are the procedures whereby Canadian issuers couldoffer securities or any offerors could make a cash tender offer in theUnited States under the multijurisdictional disclosure system. Equivalentprocedures are being proposed by the OSC and the CVMQ for use by U.S. issuersin Canada. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Offerings by Substantial Issuers </ITAG>(a) <T3>Offerings of Investment Grade Debt and Preferred Stock (Form F-9).</T3>Multijurisdictional registration would be permitted for offeringsby substantial issuers of non-convertible debt securities \171\<NOTE/> or non-convertible preferred stock that are investment grade,as defined in the United States.\172\<NOTE/> Securities that are not convertible for one year from thedate of effectiveness of the registration statement would be treated asnon-convertible. Comment is requested as to the treatment of convertiblesecurities. Should the period of non-convertibility be longer (<T3>e.g., </T3>for two or three years)?  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\171\ It should be noted that where debt securities are tobe offered pursuant to the system, a trust indenture relating to such securitiesmust be qualified under the  Trust Indenture Act. <T3>See infra </T3>section IV.G.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\172\ Securities would be ``investment grade'' if, at thetime of effectiveness of the registration statement, at least one nationallyrecognized statistical rating organization (as that term is used in rule15c-1(c)(2)(vi)(F) under the Exchange Act) has rated the security in oneof its generic rating categories that signifies investment grade; typicallythe four highest rating categories (within which there may be subcategoriesindicating relative standing) signify investment grade.  Eligible offerings of investment grade securities would be registered withthe Commission on proposed Form F-9. To be eligible to use that form, anissuer would be required to be incorporated or organized under the lawsof Canada or any Canadian province or territory, with a total market valuefor its common stock of at least (CN) $180 million and a public float \173\<NOTE/> of (CN) $75 million. The (CN) $180 million requirement parallelsone of the eligibility standards for use of Form S-3,\174\<NOTE/> which permits use of a short-form prospectus in the UnitedStates by U.S. issuers. The public float requirement is derived from theCanadian test for eligibility for the Prompt Offering Qualification system,discussed above,\175\<NOTE/> and is based on the Canadian, rather than the U.S. definitionof affiliates in determining the amount of securities publicly held. Theserequirements are expressed in terms of Canadian, rather than U.S., currencyso that fluctuations in exchange rates would not affect an issuer's eligibilityto use the Form.   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\173\ ``Public float'' is the monetary value of all outstandingequity securities owned by non-affiliates, and would be determined accordingto Canadian practice. In the multijurisdictional system, Canadian (butnot U.S.) issuers would include non-voting common stock in the calculationof public float. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\174\ Instruction I.B.1. (market value of securities of issuerto be (US) $150 million). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\175\ <T3>See </T3>text accompanying nn. 84-88, <T3>supra.</T3>Comment is requested as to whether the requirements set forth provide adequateindication of an issuer's market following. Should the market value andpublic float tests be set at different levels, and if so, should they behigher (for example, market value of (CN) $300 or $500 million, or floatof (CN) $100 or $300 million) or lower (for example, market value of (CN)$75 or $100 million or float of (CN) $25 or $50 million)? (b) <T3>Other Offerings (Form F-10).</T3> Offerings by substantial issuersof securities other than investment grade debt or preferred stock wouldbe registered on proposed Form F-10. In this context, ``substantial issuers''would be those with a common stock market value of at least (CN) $360 million(to approximate  the Commission's requirement that equity issuers eligibleto use the Form F-3 short form prospectus have a market value of votingsecurities of (U.S.) $300 million \176\<NOTE/>), and a public float of (CN) $75 million. As with Form F-9,comment is solicited as to the appropriateness of the tests for eligibilityfor Form F-10. Should the market value and public float tests be set atdifferent levels, and if so, should they be higher (for example, marketvalue of (CN) $500 or $700 million, or float of (CN) $100 or $300 million)or lower (for example, market value of (CN) $100 or $200 million or floatof (CN) $25 or $50 million)?  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\176\ Instruction I.A.4.  As discussed above, Form F-10 would require reconciliation of financialstatements to U.S. GAAP as specified in Item 18 of Commission Form 20-F.Item 18 requires the full disclosure of all information required by RegulationS-X and U.S. GAAP, including segment information and supplemental oil andgas data. Comment is solicited as to whether, if reconciliation is to berequired, Item 17 reconciliation should suffice.\177\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\177\ <T3>See supra </T3>n.29. Item 17 requires reconciliation only in measurementitems (the income statements and balance sheet amounts).  In the United States, registration statements are subject to certain industry-specificrequirements relating to an issuer's business and operations. Foreign issuers   generally are held to the same level of disclosure as domestic issuers.Given Canadian comprehensive disclosure requirements and practices, theCommission proposes to require additional industry-specific informationonly from issuers engaged in banking. Canadian banks using Form F-10 wouldbe required to disclose the information set out under Item III.C., ``RiskElements,'' and Item IV., ``Summary of Loan Loss Experience'' of IndustryGuide 3 under the Securities Act.\178\<NOTE/> Both the reconciliation and the supplemental Guide 3 informationare required to be included in both the prospectus delivered to investorsand the registration statement.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\178\ Both Canadian banks and bank holding companies (notcommon in Canada) would be covered by this requirement.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Rights and Exchange Offers </ITAG>(a) <T3>Rights Offers (Form F-7).</T3> Form F-7 is proposed for use by Canadianissuers making rights offerings in the United States. To be eligible, theissuer would have to (1) be incorporated in Canada, and (2) have had, forthe 36 months immediately preceding the offering, a class of securitieslisted on The Toronto Stock Exchange or the Montreal Exchange.\179\<NOTE/> Form F-7 would not require that registrants meet any testrelated to market    value of shares or public float. Comment is requestedas to whether the eligibility tests proposed for use of Form F-7 are appropriate,or whether the (CN) $75 million (or $10 million, $25 million or $50 million)market value requirement imposed by Form F-8 be extended to Form F-7. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\179\ Pursuant to the securities laws of Ontario or Quebec,such issuers thus would have three-year reporting histories with the OSCor CVMQ. <T3>See </T3>OSA section 1(1)(38); QSA section 68. Since it is intended that Form F-7 would exclude offerings that are majorfinancings, so that an issuer that did not meet the tests for use of FormF-10 would not be eligible to take advantage of the system by characterizingan offer as a rights offering, an eligible offer could not increase thecapital of the class of securities offered by more than 25 percent. The25 percent test is derived from Canadian requirements, which use the 25percent threshold to identify rights offerings subject to additional regulatoryrequirements.\180\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\180\ <T3>See </T3>OSA Policy Statement No. 6.2, <T3>supra </T3>n.63.  U.S. residents must hold of record \181\<NOTE/> less than 20 percent of the class of securities to whichthe rights offering related. To preclude a public offering being made indirectlyby an issuer not eligible to make such an offering, the rights could notbe transferable by U.S. residents. The underlying securities, however,could be so    transferable. Consistent with Canadian regulations, a furthercondition of Form F-7 is that the exercise period of the rights must notexceed 90 days.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\181\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 12g5-1 (17 CFR 240.12g5-1). Subject to several explanationsand qualifications set forth in that Rule, securities are deemed to be``held of record'' by each person identified as the owner of such securitiesin the records maintained by or on behalf of the issuer of such securities.The securities to be registered on Form F-7 would be those issuable uponthe exercise of rights. The rights themselves, whether issued to shareholdersby means of warrants or otherwise, generally are not registrable on a ``no-sale''theory.\182\<NOTE/> If the rights were required to be registered, the issuerwould be permitted to register them on Form F-7.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\182\ Securities Act Release No. 929 (July 29, 1936). (b) <T3>Exchange Offers (Form F-8)</T3>_(i) <T3>Registration Issues. </T3>Proposed Form F-8 would be used to registerexchange offers that are primarily Canadian in character, in which allor a portion of the consideration offered is the securities of the bidder,and less than 20 percent of the securities of the target class is heldof record by U.S. residents. The aggregate market value of the registrant'scommon stock must equal or exceed (CN) $75 million.\183\<NOTE/> As with rights offerings registered on Form F-7, registrantswould be required to have had their securities listed on The Toronto StockExchange or the Montreal Exchange for the 36 months immediately precedingthe offering. Comment is requested as to the appropriateness of these tests.Given the application of Canadian tender offer regulation to the exchangeoffer and the interdependence of tender offer and exchange registrationdisclosure, should the offer be permitted to be registered using Canadiandisclosure, without regard to the market capitalization? Should a publicfloat test be imposed, as in the case of offerings by substantial issuers?If so, should the same requirements as apply to either Form F-9 or F-l0be applied, or should a different public float be required, for example,(CN) $25 million or $50 million? Should the market value of the registrant'ssecurities be set at a higher level (for example, (CN) $100 million or$200 million) or a lower level (for example, (CN) $25 million or $50 million)?<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\183\ The securities also could be registered on Form F-9or F-10 if the offeror was eligible to use such forms, without regard tothe number of shares held by U.S. residents. The target of the bid would be required to be incorporated or organizedunder the laws of Canada or any Canadian province or territory. The bidderwould be required to offer its securities upon identical terms and conditionsto both U.S. and Canadian shareholders of the target, consistent with Canada'sall-holders and best-price policies.\184\<NOTE/> Adherence to these policies, which as discussed are similarto the Commission's All-Holders, Best Price Rule,\185\<NOTE/> would prevent discrimination among holders of the class ofsecurities that is the subject of the offer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\184\ <T3>See supra </T3>nn. 126, 130-133 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\185\ <T3>See supra </T3>n. 151 and accompanying text. Contemporaneously with the filing with Canadian authorities and mailingto target shareholders of the required documents, a Canadian offeror makingan offer pursuant to the system would file these documents, under coverof Form F-8 and accompanied by Form F-X, with the Commission. The offerand takeover bid circular would be distributed by mail in accordance withCanadian law \186\<NOTE/> to shareholders in both countries. In the United States anexchange offer cannot commence until a registration statement has becomeeffective,\187\<NOTE/> thereby delaying the commencement date of the offer pendingacceleration of the effective date.\188\<NOTE/> An exchange offer commences under Canadian law, however,immediately upon the mailing to target shareholders of the takeover bidcircular containing the required prospectus disclosure.\189\<NOTE/> Since Form F-8 and any amendments thereto would become effectivefor purposes of the Securities Act at the time the securities legally maybe sold in the principal jurisdiction, such filings could   become effectiveimmediately.\190\<NOTE/> Exchange offers registered on Form F-8 under the system thuswould commence in the United States simultaneously with dissemination toshareholders of the integrated circular.\191\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\186\ <T3>See </T3>Proposed Rule 467(a); CBCA section 198; OSA sections 97, 99;QSA section 128 and Schedule XI. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\187\ <T3>See </T3>Section 8 of the Securities Act; Rule 459 (17 CFR 230.459).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\188\ <T3>See supra </T3>n. 123, citing Rule 14d-2. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\189\ <T3>See id., </T3>citing Canadian authorities; <T3>see also supra </T3>nn. 164-166 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\190\ <T3>See </T3>General Instruction I.E. to proposed Form F-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\191\ <T3>See id.</T3>; <T3>see also </T3>proposed Rule 467. (ii) <T3>Tender Offer Regulation for Exchange Offers. </T3>Exchange offers alsoraise the question of the need for compliance with each jurisdiction'sexchange offer regulatory scheme relating to tender offers. When a Canadianbidder is eligible to use Form F-8, the tender offer regulations applicablein Canada would govern under the system, and compliance with such regulationswould be sufficient under the Williams Act. U.S. and other non-Canadianofferors not eligible to use Form F-8 similarly could make exchange offersfor the securities of Canadian issuers (where less than 20 percent of theholders of record of the subject securities were U.S. residents) pursuantto Canadian tender offer regulations. Such non-Canadian issuers, however,would have to comply with U.S. disclosure requirements, as set forth onany available Commission registration form. The application of tender offerregulation under the proposed system is discussed in Section 3 hereof. (iii) <T3>Proxy Regulation. </T3>Any solicitation of U.S. shareholders involvedin the offer and sale of securities registered on Form F-8 (for example,if, in connection with a tender offer, the issuer proposed to increaseits authorized share capital) would be exempt from Exchange Act proxy informationand filing requirements pursuant to a proposed new rule.\192\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\192\ Proposed Rule 3a12-3(c). <ITAG tagnum="81">3. </ITAG><T3>Tender Offers Pursuant to the System </T3>Pursuant to amendments to be proposed to the Commission's tender offerrules, third-party or issuer tender offer filings in connection with offersin both jurisdictions for a class of shares of a Canadian issuer, lessthan 20 percent of which is held of record by U.S. residents, would bepermitted to proceed in the United States in compliance with the law ofCanada, provided the tender offer is extended to all holders of the classof securities in the United States \193\<NOTE/> and that the transaction is covered by and not exempted fromsubstantive provisions of Canadian law regulating the terms and conditionsof the offer. In these instances, compliance with Canadian law would sufficefor compliance with the Williams Act.\194\<NOTE/> Where a bid not covered by such Canadian regulation \195\<NOTE/> was extended to U.S. shareholders, the Williams Act and therules thereunder would govern the conduct of the offer in the United Stateseven if the bid otherwise would qualify for inclusion in the multijurisdictionalsystem. The schedules would require that the bidder comply with the laws,regulations and policies of any Canadian federal and/or provincial or territorialregulatory agency applicable to the particular offer. If the offeror failedto comply with Canadian law, it would be in violation of both Canadianand U.S. law.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\193\ Consistent with the Commission's All Holders and BestPrice Rules (Rules 14d-10(b)(2), and 13e-4(f)(9)(ii), a Canadian bidderor issuer eligible to invoke the multijurisdictional system would not beprohibited from excluding from a tender offer U.S. shareholders residingin a particular state if administrative or judicial action taken pursuantto a statute enacted by that state barred extension of the offer to stateresidents. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\194\ Proposed Rule 14d-1(b) for third-party and affiliatetender offers, proposed Rule 14e-2(c) for the target company's responsethereto and proposed Rule 13e-4(h) for issuer tender offers. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\195\ For example, Canada's federal and provincial securitieslaws expressly exempt from tender offer regulation any takeover or issuerbid conducted on a recognized Canadian stock exchange such as the TSE orME. CBCA section 194 and Reg. section 58(b); OSA section 92(1)(a); QSAsection 119. Under the proposal, documents containing tender offer and prospectus disclosuresmailed to target shareholders and filed with Canadian securities authoritieswould be filed simultaneously with the Commission, together with the appropriate``wraparound'' forms or schedules (F-8 or other Securities Act registrationform for exchange offers, Schedule 14D-1F for third-party and affiliatetender offers, Schedule 14D-9F for the target's response and Schedule 13E-4Ffor issuer tender offers \196\<NOTE/>) and an executed Form F-X consenting to service of process.Information would be disseminated to all U.S. and Canadian shareholdersin accordance with Canadian law.\197\<NOTE/> U.S. shareholders would receive a Canadian offering documentbearing additional informational legends prescribed by the Commission.Where an exchange offer was being made pursuant to the system by an offerornot eligible to use Form F-8, U.S. shareholders would receive Commission-mandateddisclosure in addition to the information required to be disseminated underCanadian law. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\196\ Canadian law permits target officers and directors tofile and transmit to shareholders a recommendation regarding the offeraccompanied by his or her individual circular. <T3>See </T3>OSA section 98(3) (officers and directors); QSA section 137(senior executives). Schedule 14D-9F could be used to file such responseswith the Commission. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\197\ <T3>See supra </T3>n. 123 and accompanying text (mail delivery). Any amendmentto a document made in accordance with the laws of Canada and/or any ofits provinces or territories, would be filed with the Commission undercover of an amended wraparound form and transmitted to shareholders ofthe subject company residing in the United States in compliance with applicableCanadian law. While the eligibility of a bidder to use Form F-8 would depend upon whetherthe bidder met the specified nationality, size, market value and floattests, there would be no such eligibility standards for bidders makingcash tender offers. Under either circumstance, however, the subject issuermust be a Canadian reporting company, less than 20 percent of the subjectsecurities of which is held of record by U.S. residents.\198\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\198\ In order to fall within the subject matter jurisdictionof the Williams Act's tender offer provisions and, accordingly, the provisionsof proposed Rule 14d-1(b), the securities sought to be acquired must beequity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. Withrespect to issuer tender offers, however, the securities of any issuerfiling periodic reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 15(d) ofthe Exchange Act, or that has any class of equity security registered pursuantto Section 12 of the Exchange Act, also may be subject to Rule 13e-4.  It should be emphasized that bidders using Schedule 14D-1F would not berelieved of any obligation to file a Schedule 13D \199\<NOTE/> that may arise, should their beneficial ownership of thetarget's equity securities subject to the offer exceed five percent.\200\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\199\ 17 CFR 240-13d 101. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\200\ <T3>See </T3>General Instruction I.D. of proposed Schedule 14D-1F.Neither an F-8 eligible registrant,\201\<NOTE/> an all-cash bidder nor the issuer \202\<NOTE/> would be exempt, by virtue of the proposed rule amendments,from the civil liability and antifraud provisions of Sections 10(b), 13(e),14(e) and 18 and Rules 10b-5, 13e-4(b)(1) and 14e-3 under the ExchangeAct nor, in the case of an exchange offer, from the provisions of Sections11, 22(2) and 17(a) of the Securities Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\201\ Part III.B. of proposed Form F-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\202\ General Instruction III.B. of proposed Schedule 14D-1F;General Instruction III.B. of proposed Schedule 14D-9F; General InstructionIII.B. of proposed Schedule 13E-4F.In cases of tender offers ineligible for multijurisdictional treatmentin the United States because 20 percent or more of the subject shares wereheld by U.S. residents, the rules and regulations of the United Statesgenerally would apply. In the Commission's view, the requisite use of thejurisdictional means can be established, notwithstanding the absence ofan affirmative act of the bidder, where it is reasonably foreseeable thatU.S. shareholders of a foreign issuer that have been excluded from an offshoreoffer will sell their shares into the market in response to that offer.\203\<NOTE/> Further, as a policy matter, the Commission, the Canadianfederal government, the OSC and the CVMQ believe that tender offers shouldbe extended to all holders of the class of securities in Canada and theUnited States, and that efforts to avoid compliance with the other jurisdiction'sregulation by attempting to exclude certain shareholders from the offerare consistent neither with the purposes of either country's laws nor withthe public interest.\204\<NOTE/> The United States and Canada mutually recognize this principleof equal treatment of target shareholders in the tender offer context.Traditional precepts of comity do not call for exclusion of either country'sshareholders from a tender offer, but rather for the offer to be made onan equal basis to all shareholders. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\203\ <T3>See Schmuck </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>109 S. Ct. 1443 (1989); <T3>Carpenter </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>484 U.S. 19 (1987). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\204\ The terms of an exchange offer for certain, otherwisequalified Canadian issuers may conflict with restrictions on foreign ownershipimposed by Canadian and United States law. Such provisions, for example,effectively would prohibit the acquisition by Canadian shareholders ofstock in U.S. entities holding oil and gas leases (<T3>see </T3>30 U.S.C. 181, 184, 188), or by U.S. shareholders of stockin a Canadian energy company (<T3>see </T3>Section 7 of the Alberta Energy Act, R.S.A. 1980 C.A. 17 s.7).Under circumstances where national policy concerns may militate againstapplication of the principles of equality underlying the multijurisdictionalsystem, the Commission may determine to exercise its exemptive authorityunder Rules 14d-10(e) or 13e-4(g)(7) (All Holders) to permit a Canadianbidder to issue cash consideration in lieu of securities in connectionwith an exchange offer concurrently made to Canadian holders of the target.Relief thus may be sought from this ``all holders'' policy that otherwisewould mandate the extension of an exchange offer to U.S. shareholders ofthe Canadian target on the identical terms and conditions offered to Canadianshareholders. D. Exchange Act Provisions Affecting the Activities of Participantsin Tender and Exchange Offers Rule 10b-6 generally prohibits a distribution participant from, directlyor indirectly, bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induce othersto purchase, the securities in distribution or any security of the sameclass and series or any right to purchase such security (``related securities''),until the participant's role in the distribution has terminated.\205\<NOTE/> Rule 10b-13 prohibits a person who is making a cash tenderoffer or exchange offer for any equity security from, directly or indirectly,purchasing or making any arrangement to purchase such security (or anyother security which is immediately convertible into or exchangeable forsuch security) otherwise than pursuant to the tender offer or exchangeoffer, from the time of announcement of the offer until its expiration,including any extensions thereof. The rule is designed to ``protect shareholdersin the tender offer from the harmful effects of purchases or arrangementsmade outside, and on terms or conditions different from, the tender offer,and to protect the integrity of the tender offer process by proscribingside deals that could render the tender offer a sham.'' \206\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\205\ During an exchange offer, the bidder's securities wouldbe in distribution and the distribution participants would be prohibitedfrom bidding for or purchasing those securities or any related securitiesuntil the exchange offer ended. <T3>See also </T3>QSA Section 252.1; OSC Policy Statement 9.3(C) (Dec.24, 1982) (as amended), <T3>reprinted in </T3>3 Cdn. Sec. L. Rep. (CCH) andpara; 471-903 (concerningstock exchange bids). The target's securities in an exchange offer areconsidered ``rights to purchase'' the securities in distribution; accordingly,distribution participants also would be prohibited from purchasing thosesecurities during the exchange offer. <T3>See </T3>Exchange Act Release No. 19565 (March 4, 1983) (48 FR 10628,10636 n.58). To a degree, Rule 10b-13 (17 CFR 240.10b 13) contains a similarprohibition on the purchase of target securities. <T3>See Piper </T3>v. <T3>Chris Craft Industries, Inc., </T3>430 U.S. l, 43 n.30 (1977).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\206\ Brief of the Securities and Exchange Commission, <T3>Amicus Curiae </T3>at 2, <T3>Texaco Inc. </T3>v. <T3>Pennzoil Co., </T3>No. C-6432 (Sup. Ct. Tex., July 1987). Canadian procedures permit participants in transactions contemplated byproposed Form F-8 and Schedules 14D-1F and 13E-4F to engage in certainactivities that are prohibited by Rules 10b-6 and 10b-23. For example,Canadian provisions permit, in limited circumstances, purchases by an offerorduring a third-party bid, or by an issuer during an issuer bid, otherwisethan pursuant to a tender offer conducted by circular bid.\207\<NOTE/> Such purchases are permitted from the third business dayfollowing the date of the bid until its termination. Purchases are conditionedupon limiting the amount of securities acquired to five percent of theoutstanding securities as of the date of the bid, disclosing the intentionto make such purchases in the third-party or issuer bid circular, and issuingand filing a press release with the relevant exchange or regulatory commissionat the close of each day on which securities have been purchased.\208\<NOTE/> The press release is required to disclose the purchaser,the number of shares purchased, the highest price paid on that day, theaverage price paid for the securities that were purchased by the purchaserthrough the facilities of the stock exchange during the bid, and the totalnumber of securities owned by the purchaser as of the close of businessof the stock exchange on that day.\209\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\207\ <T3>See </T3>CBCA section 197(f); OSA sections 93(3)-(7); QSA sections120, 142. Note, however, that various other provisions of Canadian lawproscribe transactions before and after the tender offer period and affordprotections similar to those contained in Rule 10b-13. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>OSA section 93(5) (integrating pre-bid private transactionsby an offeror with formal bid purchases and requiring the offeror, <T3>inter alia, </T3>to offer consideration for securities deposited underthe bid at least equal to the highest consideration paid on a per securitybasis in any such prior transaction); OSA section 93(6) (proscribing purchasesby an offeror of the securities that were the subject of the bid for aperiod of 20 days after the expiration of the bid on terms not generallyavailable to holders of that class of securities). The restrictions ofOSA sections 93 (5) and (6) do not apply to trades effected in the normalcourse on a published market, subject to certain conditions. <T3>See </T3><T3>also </T3>OSC Policy Statement 9.3, <T3>supra </T3>n.204. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\208\ OSA section 93(3) and Reg. section 169; QSA section142. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\209\ <T3>See </T3>QSA section 142; OSA Reg. section 169. In connection with the proposed multijurisdictional disclosure system,the Commission is considering publication of no-action positions with respectto Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13. The contemplated no-action positions would applysolely to tender and exchange offers on Form F-8 and Schedules 14D-lF and13E-4F, and would permit securities purchases in Canada that are not madefor the purposes of creating actual or apparent trading activity in orof raising the price of such securities. The no-action positions wouldpermit: (1) With respect to cash tender offers, purchases of the securitieswhich are the subject of the offer and any other security that is a rightto purchase such security or is immediately convertible into or exchangeablefor such security (``target securities''); and (2) with respect to exchangeoffers, purchases of target securities and bids for and purchases of thesecurities offered by the bidder or issuer (``offered securities''), andany security of the same class and series or any right to purchase anysuch offered securities (collectively, ``subject securities'').\210\<NOTE/> The proposed no-action positions would be available to issuersand bidders that: (1) Disclose in the Form F-8 and Schedules 13E-4F and14D-1F the possibility of, or the intent to make, purchases of subjectsecurities as permitted by applicable Canadian regulations; and (2) submitan undertaking to disclose in the U.S. information regarding purchasesof subject securities on the same basis as it is required to be disclosedor otherwise is disclosed pursuant to Canadian statutory and regulatoryrequirements.\211\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\210\ All exceptions, exemptions, and no-action positionswith respect to Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13 are premised upon the conditionthat none of the transactions thereby permitted is engaged in for a manipulativepurpose. <T3>See </T3>Rule 10b-6(a)(4); <T3>Jaffee andamp; Co. </T3>v. <T3>SEC, </T3>446 F.2d 391 (2d Cir. 1977); <T3>Bruns, Nordeman andamp; Co., </T3>40 S.E.C. 652, 660 (1961). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\211\ Canadian regulatory officials and broker-dealers haveadvised the staff that it would not be a significant burden to providethis additional disclosure.The Commission believes that the proposed no-action positions with respectto Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13 are consistent with the philosophy underlyingthe proposed multijurisdictional disclosure system, and represent an appropriateaccommodation that recognizes that Canadian procedures applicable to tenderand exchange offers afford a large measure of the protections providedby Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13. The contemplated no-action positions would beannounced in the release if and when proposed Form F-8 and Schedules 13E-4Fand 14D-1F are adopted, announced in a companion release, or incorporatedinto Form F-8 and Schedules 13E-4F and 14D-1F. Commenters are invited toaddress the scope and content of the proposed no-action positions, as wellas the means by which the requisite undertaking is made. E. Proxy and Insider Reports Canadian issuers that currently are eligible to use Form 20-F are not subjectto U.S. proxy regulation.\212\<NOTE/> All other Canadian issuers, however, must comply with bothCanadian and U.S. proxy regulations when they solicit U.S. residents. Inconnection with the implementation of the system, the Commission proposesto amend certain of the proxy rules to allow compliance by Canadian issuerswith Canadian proxy rules to suffice for U.S. purposes.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\212\ Rule 3a12-3. The Commission's proxy rules provide that, if an issuer is soliciting proxiesfor an annual meeting at which the only matters being voted upon includesuch routine items as the election of directors or/and ratification orapproval of accountants, only definitive proxy statements must be filedwith the Commission.\213\<NOTE/> Thus, no filing of preliminary materials is required. Ifa Canadian issuer falls within the provisions of this rule so that onlydefinitive material is required to be filed, the amendments to Rule 14a-6proposed today would provide that the proxy material need only be preparedin accordance with Canadian requirements.\214\<NOTE/> If, however, the matters to be voted on would require thefiling of preliminary proxy materials in the United States, then a Canadianissuer subject to U.S. proxy rules would be required to prepare the proxystatement in accordance with U.S. rules.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\213\ Rule 14a-6(a) (17 CFR 240.14a-6(a)) sets forth the circumstancesunder which any issuer must file only definitive proxy materials. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\214\ <T3>Id. See </T3>proposed Rule 14a-6(m). Canadian issuers whose proxy materialsdescribe a meeting the subject matter of which would require filing ofonly definitive materials will be required only to file definitive materialswith the Commission.  An additional area affected by the proposed rule changes would be thatof shareholder proposals. An amendment to Rule 14a-8 under the ExchangeAct \215\<NOTE/> would    provide that any Canadian issuer subject to U.S.proxy rules that complied with applicable Canadian shareholder proposalrules would be deemed to have complied with the requirements of Rule 14a-8. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\215\ 17 CFR 240.14a-8. <T3>See </T3>proposed Rule 14a-8(f).  Directors, officers and principal stockholders of Canadian and other foreignprivate issuers eligible to use Form 20-F are not subject \216\<NOTE/> to Section 16 of the Exchange Act.\217\<NOTE/> In a situation somewhat analogous to the case of proxy regulation,Canadian persons that are in certain relationships with a Canadian foreignprivate issuer must comply with both Canadian and U.S. reporting requirements.The Commission today is proposing a new rule \218\<NOTE/> that would provide that only persons required to report theirsecurities holdings in Canada would be required to report to the Commission,and the reporting obligations with the Commission could be met by furnishingthe report filed with the Canadian authorities.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\216\ Rule 3a12-3. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\217\ The reporting obligations of Section 16 are implementedby Rules 16a-1 through 16a-11 (17 CFR 240.16a-1 through 240.16a-11).

F. Continuous Disclosure Issuers that make a registered offering of securities in the United States,or that acquire a certain number of   shareholders of record resident inthe United States, are subject to reporting requirements under the ExchangeAct. Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act,\219\<NOTE/> as supplemented by Regulation 15D,\220\<NOTE/> requires each issuer that has filed a registration statementthat has become effective pursuant to the Securities Act to file periodicreports thereafter.\221\<NOTE/> Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act also requires each issuerthat has securities registered under Section 12 of that Act to file periodicreports.\222\<NOTE/> Securities may be registered under Section 12 for two reasons.Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act requires registration of any class ofsecurities, whether debt or equity, that is listed on a national securitiesexchange.\223\<NOTE/> Section 12(g) requires issuers to register any class of equitysecurities held of record by 500 or more    persons if certain asset testsare met.\224\<NOTE/> Foreign private issuers are exempt from the requirementsof Section 12(g) if they have fewer than 300 U.S. holders.

Form 20-F is also the form used forannual reports by non-Canadian foreign issuers and eligible Canadian issuers.However, since it is not available for annual reports by issuers that havea reporting obligation under Sections 12(b) or 15(d), most Canadian issuerscurrently file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Qand current reports on Form 8-K. General Instruction A.(b) to Form 20-F.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\225\ Rule 12g3-2(b) exempts from Section 12(g) issuers thatfurnish to the Commission the documents that they either are required toor actually do make public, file with their home regulatory agency, ordistribute to their security holders. Rule 12g3-2(b) is not available toissuers quoted on NASDAQ. When the Commission adopted this position regardingissuers quoted on NASDAQ, it ``grandfathered'' certain issuers alreadyrelying on this exemption that were so quoted. The grandfathered periodhas expired with respect to all Canadian issuers. Securities Act ReleaseNo. 6493 (Oct. 6, 1983).Any Section 15(d) obligation resulting solely from use of the forms proposedtoday could be met by filing with the Commission under cover of proposedForm 40-F the periodic disclosure documents required in Canada. These wouldinclude Annual Information Forms (for Prompt Offering Qualification issuers),annual and interim financial  statements and material change reports.\226\<NOTE/> Documents would be filed with the Commission at the sametime as they were filed with the appropriate Canadian agency. No reconciliationof financial statements would be required. All Canadian disclosure documentsfiled with the Commission, as discussed above, would be subject to antifraudand Section 18 liability.\227\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\226\ <T3>See </T3>discussion of reporting requirements in Section III.B., <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\227\ <T3>See supra </T3>nn. 96-100 and accompanying text. Canadian issuers that incurred registration or reporting obligations underSection 12(g) generally would be required to fulfill those obligationsby filing regular SEC continuous disclosure forms.\228\<NOTE/> The proposed system, however, would permit Canadian issuersthat met the tests for eligibility for use of Form F-10 (<T3>i.e., </T3>that had an aggregate market value for their securitiesof (CN) $360 million and a public float of (CN) $75 million), regardlessof whether they had made offerings pursuant to the system (``F-10 issuers''),to comply with Section 12(g) continuous disclosure requirements by filingthe equivalent Canadian  documents under cover of Form 40-F. Reconciliationof financial statements would be required, but (as in annual reports onForm 20-F) this reconciliation would be to Item 17 of Form 20-F ratherthan to Item 18. The Commission will consider comments received in responseto its questions concerning the need for reconciliation for offerings onForm F-10 in determining whether to require reconciliation for continuousreporting purposes. The Commission requests comment as to whether thereare distinct reasons not to require reconciliation for Exchange Act reportingpurposes.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\228\ Form 20-F would be used to register and report, andForm 6-K would be used to report, by Canadian issuers that had not registeredan offering under the Securities Act (<T3>e.g., </T3>pursuant to the proposed system). Canadian issuers thathad registered securities pursuant to the proposed system would have toregister on Form 10 and report on Forms 10-K, 8-K and 10-Q. See GeneralInstruction A(b) to Form 20-F. As is the case with F-10 issuers, Canadian issuers that met the test foreligibility for use of Form F-9 (<T3>i.e., </T3>that had an aggregate market value for the securities of(CN) $180 million and a public float of (CN) $75 million), even if theyhad not made an offering pursuant to the system (``F-9 issuers''), couldcomply with Section 12(g) continuous disclosure requirements that arosein connection with nonconvertible investment grade preferred stock \229\<NOTE/> by filing Canadian periodic reporting documents under coverof Form 40-F. Reconciliation of financial statements would not be required.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\229\ Section 12(g) does not apply to debt securities. The exemption from Section 12(g) provided by Rule 12g3-2(b) would continueto exist and would be unaffected by adoption of the multijurisdictionalsystem. A Canadian  issuer currently furnishing Canadian disclosure documentsto the Commission pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) that extended a public offerinto the United States registered on the proposed forms would become subjectto the periodic reporting requirements of Section 15(d). It could meetthis obligation by filing with the Commission the same documents as itpresently furnishes under Rule 12g3-2(b), except that documents would befiled under cover of Form 40-F. Further, Section 18 liability under theExchange Act now would attach to those filings.\230\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\230\ Information supplied to the Commission under Rule 12g3-2(b)is not ``filed'' with the Commission and therefore is not subject to Section18 liability. Section 12(b) registration \231\<NOTE/> and reporting obligations would be treated similarly underthe system to obligations arising under Section 12(g). Canadian issuersthat had a class of securities listed on an exchange would have to fileSEC continuous disclosure documents. F-10 issuers, and F-9 issuers of non-convertibleinvestment grade debt or non-convertible investment grade preferred stock,however, would be able to comply with their Section 12(b) reporting obligationsby filing the appropriate Canadian forms under cover of proposed Form 40-F.If the class of securities listed was non-convertible investment gradedebt    or preferred stock, no reconciliation of financial statements wouldbe required, while if other securities were listed, Item 17 reconciliationwould be required. Comment is requested as to whether, when non-convertibleinvestment grade debt or preferred stock is listed, the issuer thereofshould be permitted to meet Section 12(b) reporting obligations by filingCanadian documents, whether or not it met any size test.\232\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\231\ Form 8-A could be used to register listed securitiesin conjunction with the Forms proposed today in the same way as it is presentlyused with standard Commission forms.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\232\ <T3>Compare </T3>General Instruction I.A.4. to Form F-3; General InstructionI.B.2. to Form S-3 (no size requirements to use such forms if investmentgrade debt, and investment grade preferred stock in the case of Form S-3,is offered).The Commission recognizes the potential anomalies of permitting use ofthe system to meet continuous disclosure requirements under Section 15(d),but only permitting its use to meet similar continuous disclosure requirementsunder other sections of the Exchange Act by specified, larger issuers.For example, a relatively small Canadian issuer of debt securities tradingover-the-counter in the United States would not be subject to reportingrequirements. If it listed those securities in the United States, it wouldbecome subject to Section 12(b) reporting obligations, and would have tofile U.S. documents with the Commission. If later it met the size requirementsfor Form F-9, it could file Canadian documents with the Commission. Similarly,issuers making exchange offers (but not meeting the tests for eligibilityfor Form F-9 or F-10) are likely to encounter Section 12(g) continuousreporting requirements immediately upon consummation of the offer. The Commission therefore requests comment as to whether the system shouldbe extended to permit its use for continuous disclosure purposes by a largernumber of issuers. Should the system be extended to encompass all Canadianissuers having a reporting obligation under Section 12(b), to all issuershaving a reporting obligation under Section 12(g), or to both, and if notto both groups of issuers, upon what grounds should they be distinguished?Should all issuers to which the system is extended meet the requirementsfor inclusion in the Prompt Offering Qualification systems? Should issuersbe permitted to use Canadian disclosure documents for particular classesof securities, for example, for all investment grade securities or forall investment grade debt securities, in all circumstances? Should FormsS-3 and F-3 be amended to permit the incorporation by reference of informationfiled on proposed Form 40-F? Canadian issuers currently filing SEC continuous disclosure forms couldchange to filing Canadian forms on the same basis as issuers filing registrationstatements on the proposed forms,<T3> i.e.,</T3> they would have to meet the same size tests and reconciletheir financial statements as described above. Canadian issuers that hadnot made an offering pursuant to the multijurisdictional system, and thusdid not have a Form F-X on file with the Commission, would be requiredto file a Form F-X if they wished to comply with the Commission's periodicreporting requirements by filing Canadian documents under cover of Form40-F. G. Use of Foreign Trustees in Trust Indentures <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Background </ITAG>The Trust Indenture Act applies generally to the offer and sale of debtsecurities and participation interests in debt securities if the meansof U.S. interstate commerce are used. In such cases, the securities mustbe issued under an indenture that has been qualified under the Act, unlessan exemption is available. The Trust Indenture Act imposes standards ofconduct on the indenture trustee, requires the furnishing of reports andnotices by the obligor and the trustee, regulates impairments of holders'rights to sue for principal and interest on the indenture securities andestablishes eligibility requirements for the indenture trustee. Section 310(a)(1) of the Trust Indenture Act establishes the eligibilityrequirements for trustees to serve under a qualified indenture.\233\<NOTE/> The indenture must require that there at all times shallbe one or more trustees serving under the indenture, at least one of whomat all times shall be a corporation organized and doing business underthe laws of the United States or of any state or territory or the Districtof Columbia.\234\<NOTE/> The trustee also must be authorized under such laws to exercisecorporate trust powers, and be subject to supervision or examination byFederal, State, territorial or District of Columbia authority. Absent anexemption,\235\<NOTE/> a Canadian issuer selling securities in the United States\236\<NOTE/> pursuant to the multijurisdictional registration system wouldbe obligated to comply with the requirement to have a U.S. trustee.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\233\ 15 U.S.C. 77jjj(a)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\234\ <T3>Id. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\235\ <T3>E.g., </T3>Section 304(a)(6) of the Trust Indenture Act (15 U.S.C.77ddd) (exemption for securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign governmentor subdivision, agency or instrumentality thereof).  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\236\ The staff has granted numerous no-action letters involvingoffers and sales of securities otherwise than under a qualified indenture,where the securities were being offered and sold outside the United Statesin reliance upon Securities Act Release No. 4708 (July 9, 1964) (29 FR9828). <T3>E.g., Goldman. Sachs andamp; Co. </T3>(Oct. 3, 1985). The Commissionhas expressed its intention to continue this position if Proposed RegulationS is adopted. Securities Act Release No. 6779 (June 10, 1988) (53 FR 22661).The U.S. trustee requirement of Section 310(a)(1) could create an impedimentto the efficient use of the multijurisdictional system by Canadian issuers.In practice, trust indentures in Canada invariably provide for all trusteesto be Canadian registered trust companies; \237\<NOTE/> thus, the U.S. trustee requirement would disrupt establishedCanadian business practices. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\237\ <T3>See generally </T3>Waters, <T3>Law of Trusts in Canada </T3>100-103 (2d ed. 1984).  Under the Trust Indenture Act, the Commission may exercise authority inaccordance with Section 304(d) to exempt from one or more provisions ofthe Trust Indenture Act any security issued or proposed to be issued bya foreign person. Such authority may be exercised upon application by aforeign issuer, and after opportunity for a hearing, if the Commissionfinds that compliance is not necessary ``in the public interest and forthe protection of investors.'' Since Section 304(d) requires that the Commissionmake a finding after opportunity for a hearing, thus contemplating case-by-casedeterminations, exemptions under this Section may not be granted pursuantto a rule promulgated by the Commission.\238\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\238\ The Commission has not, to date, promulgated any rulesor forms under Section 304(d). <T3>Compare </T3>Rule 4c-4 (17 CFR 260.4c-4) (applications under Section304(c)(1)); Rule 4c-5 (17 CFR 260.4c-5) (applications under Section 304(c)(2));Form T-4 (17 CFR 269.4) (form for applications for exemption pursuant toSection 304(c)). Applications currently are made by the issuer_formally,but without any specific form_and decided on a case-by-case basis by theCommission or staff. <T3>E.g., Allgemeine Elektricitats-Gesellschaft, </T3>Release 39-8l (1955);<T3>The Mexican Light and Power Company Limited, </T3>Release No. 39-48(l949). The exemptive authority under Section 304(d) has been delegatedto the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance. 17 CFR 200.30-1(e)(2).The Commission has proposed the Trust Indenture Reform Act of 1989 (``Bill''),which was introduced this legislative session into both houses of the Congress.\239\<NOTE/> This Bill is designed to refine provisions of the Trust IndentureAct to accommodate new developments in the types of debt instruments anddistribution techniques. If enacted, the Commission's proposal would conditionallypermit foreign persons to act as sole trustees under qualified indentures.\240\<NOTE/> Pending passage of the Bill, the Commission today is proposingthe establishment of a process for application for exemption from the relevantprovisions of the Trust Indenture Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\239\ S. 651, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 135 Cong.

On June 1, 1989, the Subcommittee on Telecommunicationsand Finance, Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representativesheld hearings on the bill. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\240\ The bill would automatically incorporate the mandatoryprovisions of the Trust Indenture Act into each qualified indenture; confermore general exemptive authority upon the Commission, enabling it to adaptthe Trust Indenture Act to market conditions; change the time at whicha trustee having a proscribed conflict of interest must resign to 90 daysafter an event of default (excluding notice and/or grace periods), ratherthan within 90 days after the trustee ascertains that it has such proscribedconflict of interest; include creditor status as a proscribed conflictof interest; and effect technical changes intended to modernize requirementsunder the Act that do not compromise indenture security holder protection.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Exemptive Relief Under Section 304(d) </ITAG>The Commission is proposing two alternative methods of applying for waiverof the U.S. trustee requirement in offerings made pursuant to the multijurisdictionalsystem. One method would permit application for waiver to be made on theproposed registration forms themselves. The other would provide for applicationprior to making any filing pursuant to the multijurisdictional system.Under the prior application system, a waiver, if granted, would be effectivefor a year. Prior application would be particularly useful in the casewhere there were already security holders under the indenture proposedto be used and the requirement discussed below to provide notice to suchholders would delay an anticipated offering. Proposed Rules 4d-1 to 4d-6 would implement Section 304(d) of the TrustIndenture Act by establishing a procedure under which Canadian issuerscould apply for an exemption from the U.S. trustee requirement of Section310(a) of the Act.\241\<NOTE/> As required under Section 304(d), applications would continueto be decided on a case-by-case basis.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\241\ Applications for exemption from other provisions ofthe Act (if necessary) or by foreign issuers not using the multijurisdictionalforms still could be made pursuant to the statutory exemptive process ofSection 304(d). a. <T3>Application for Waiver at Time of Offering </T3>The first method of applying under Section 304(d)\242\<NOTE/> and Rule 4d-1 for a waiver of U.S. trustee requirements ofSection 310(a)(I) would permit application to be made on the form usedto register the offering. An issuer applying for a waiver would so indicateon the cover page of the form, and would provide the information regardingthe trustee requested by the form (which is the same as the substantiveinformation that would be provided on Form T-5). It also would indicatewhether there were any securities already outstanding under the indenture.Under the proposal, an application for an exemption from the requirementsof Section 310(a)(1) of the Act could be filed pursuant to Section 304(d)and Rule 4d-1 if three conditions were met. First, the application mustrelate to securities registered or to be registered on Form F-7, F-8, F-9,or F-10 under the Securities Act. Second, the application must relate tosecurities that have been issued or that the applicant reasonably expectsto issue within one year from the date of application.\243\<NOTE/> Third, the application must relate to securities that havebeen or will be issued under an indenture that (i) is or will be qualifiedunder the Act, and (ii) requires there to be at all times one or more trusteesthereunder, at least one of whom is a corporation or other person organizedand doing business under the laws of Canada or any province thereof (referredto as the institutional trustee), and is (A) authorized under such lawsto exercise corporate trust powers, and (B) subject to supervision or examinationby governmental authority. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\242\ Section 304(d) provides that the Commission may exemptsecurities issued or ``proposed to be issued.'' <T3>Compare</T3> Section 6 of the Securities Act (registration statementdeemed effective only as to securities ``proposed to be offered''). Rule415 under the Securities Act permits securities specified in Rule 415(a)(1)(viii)through (x) to be registered only in an amount which, at the time the registrationstatement becomes effective, is reasonably expected to be offered and soldwithin two years from the initial effective date of registration. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\243\ See discussion of application for waiver prior to offering,<T3>infra</T3>. Proposed Rule 4d-4 provides that if an applicant files an application relatingto securities issued or issuable under an indenture under which any othersecurities are outstanding, the applicant must send concurrently, by firstclass mail or other equally prompt means, notice of such application toall holders of record of outstanding securities under such indenture.\244\<NOTE/> The proposal requires the notice to advise holders of thefiling of the application.\245\<NOTE/> Any request by a holder for a hearing must be filed within20 days of the application date set forth on such notice. A subsequentnotice must be sent to such holders if any hearing on the application isto be held by the Commission.\246\<NOTE/> Commenters should address whether, as an alternative, noticeshould be given whether or not there are outstanding securities under theindenture and whether that notice should be required to be by publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or otherwise, instead of or in addition to theprocedure described above. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\244\ A copy of such notice shall also be filed with the Commissionas part of the application. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\245\ The notice also must set forth the date on which theapplication was filed with the Commission and state that any interestedperson may request in writing, within 20 days of the date of filing ofthe application, that a hearing be held. Such request shall state the natureof the interested person's interest and the reason for such request. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\246\ Notice of hearing must include the time, place and natureof the hearing, the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the hearingis being held, and the matters of fact and law at issue.Proposed Rule 4d-5 gives an applicant the opportunity to waive a hearingand request the Commission to decide the application without a formal hearingon the basis of the application and other information and documents thatthe Commission designates as part of the record. However, under the proposal,a hearing may be called upon order of the Commission notwithstanding thatthe applicant shall have filed a waiver and request whenever, in the judgmentof the Commission, such a hearing is necessary or appropriate in the publicinterest. The proposal requires the applicant, at the request of the Commission,to furnish such additional information or documents as the Commission maydeem necessary to decide the application. If no hearing were held, the Commission would issue an order granting theexemption on the twentieth day following the filing of the application.If there were no securities already outstanding under the relevant indenture,the Commission could grant the exemption at any time after the filing.Applications pursuant to Proposed Rule 4d-1 would be considered and decidedon a case-by-case basis. In deciding whether to grant applications, theCommission would consider all the relevant facts and circumstances, includingcomparability of regulation with respect to supervision and examinationby governmental authority of the foreign trustee. One factor to be considered in deciding applications is the extent to whichthe foreign trustee is subject to supervision or examination substantiallyequivalent to that applicable to U.S. institutional trustees. Althoughapplications would be decided under the proposal on a case-by-case basis,the Commission's staff has preliminarily reviewed regulation of trust companiesunder the laws of Canada and Ontario. In order to be licensed under thefederal statute to operate as a trust company, a corporation must filean application, satisfy capital and other requirements, and comply withinspection and recordkeeping requirements.\247\<NOTE/> Similarly, in order to be licensed under the Ontario TrustCompany Act, a corporation must file an application, satisfy minimum capitalrequirements, demonstrate fitness of insiders, and demonstrate that theproposed plan of operations is feasible. The Ontario statute also establishesrecordkeeping requirements and accounting rules, and requires the filingof an annual return.\248\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\247\ Trust Companies Act, R.S.C. 1970, Chap. T-16, as amended.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\248\ Loan and Trust Corporation Act, S.O. 1987, c. 33. b. <T3>Application for Waiver Prior to Offering. </T3>Another method of applyingfor a waiver of U.S. trustee requirements would permit application to bemade in advance. This provision would allow issuers to file applicationspursuant to Rule 4d-1 in advance of filing a registration statement ona multijurisdictional form, if the issuer reasonably expected to issuethe securities within one year from the date of application. Comment isrequested as to whether this provision is appropriate. Specifically, shouldthe period of applicability for the waiver be longer than one year, forexample, two or three years? Applications for waiver prior to an offering would be filed on Form T-5.The applicant would be required to describe, as part of the application,the securities that are the subject of the application and to identifythe indenture or indentures under which the securities are issued or tobe issued. Form T-5 only would require, however, such information as wouldindicate the type and general character of the securities. Thus, the applicantmight provide a non-specific description of the securities, such as ``unsecureddebentures or notes.'' Under Rule 4d-1 and Form T-5, as proposed, the applicationcould relate, moreover, to different types or classes of securities issuedor to be issued under different indentures, but appropriate descriptionwould be required to be given in the Form T-5, such as: ``unsecured debenturesto be issued under an indenture between the applicant and trustee x,''and ``mortgage bonds to be issued under an indenture and deed of trustbetween the applicant and trustee y.'' \249\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\249\ It should be noted, however, that nothing in the proposedrules or forms would change current policies and practices concerning thequalification of ``open-ended'' indentures. An ``open-ended'' indenturefrequently provides only a general description of securities. Under staffpolicies and procedures, however, an ``open-ended'' indenture cannot pertainto both secured and unsecured, or subordinated and unsubordinated, securities.As is the case with applications made at the time of offering, waiverswould be granted on a case-by-case basis, and the same factors would betaken into account in granting a waiver. Again, as is the case with applicationsmade prior to the offering, the Commission would issue an order grantingthe exemption on the twentieth day of the application if no hearing wereheld. If there were no securities already outstanding under the relevantindenture, the Commission could grant the exemption at any time after thefiling. Comment is requested as to whether notice of the application shouldbe given in all cases, whether or not there are securities outstandingunder the indenture and whether that notice should be required to be bypublication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> or otherwise, instead of or in addition to theapplicant's mailing of notice to security holders. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. State Securities Regulation  </ITAG>In addition to complying with the federal securities laws, issuers sellingtheir securities in the United States are subject to the securities lawsof the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Generally,these laws require state registration of offerings made to persons in thestate. In most jurisdictions, the registration statement filed with the Commissionwill also satisfy the state filing requirements. The filings are subjectto review by each of the states, as to the adequacy of the disclosure and,in many states, for compliance with additional substantive standards. Forexample, a state may have the authority to deny registration if the offeringinvolves excessive ``cheap stock'' to promoters, excessive options or warrants,unreasonable underwriters' compensation, or excessive dilution, or if aclass of common stock lacks voting rights. Various exemptions from registration under state law are available; thetwo most relevant to the multijurisdictional disclosure process are thatfor rights offerings and that for securities traded in specified marketplaces.The former exemption is usually limited to rights which are either nontransferableor exercisable for only a limited period of time. The marketplace exemptionsgenerally apply to securities listed on the New York and American StockExchanges, and in some instances on specified regional exchanges, or designatedas National Market System securities and quoted on NASDAQ. Securities ofthe same issuer which are senior to securities included in an exempt marketplaceare also exempt.Two factors have operated to produce considerable uniformity among thestates. First, the securities laws of most states are modeled after theUniform Securities Act. Second, the North American Securities AdministratorsAssociation (``NASAA'')\250\<NOTE/> proposes uniform guidelines and procedures which are frequentlyadopted by many of its member states. Notwithstanding these factors, thespecific requirements for offering and selling securities in any  statewill be governed by that jurisdiction's statute, rules and policies.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\250\ NASAA is an association of state and provincial securitiesregulators in the United States and Canada. In April 1989, NASAA adopted a Statement on Internationalization of theSecurities Markets, in which it urged securities regulators to ``encouragelegitimate capital raising activities across national borders,'' subjectto ``minimum rules to ensure investor protection.'' Consistent with thatStatement, NASAA has formed a special task force to work with the Commissionand the provinces of Ontario and Quebec to determine what accommodationswould be appropriate at the state level to facilitate use of the multijurisdictionaldisclosure process. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Request for Comments </ITAG>Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on any aspectof the Forms and Rules proposed today, or the multijurisdictional disclosuresystem as a whole, is requested to do so. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Cost-Benefit Analysis </ITAG>To evaluate fully the benefits and costs associated with the proposed multijurisdictionaldisclosure system, the Commission requests commenters to provide viewsand data as to the costs and benefits associated with multijurisdictionalofferings and tender offers under current law as compared to such costsand benefits under the proposed system. The Commission is not aware ofany additional costs that would result from the proposed system, as issuerswould be able to avoid expenses associated with the preparation of morethan one disclosure document. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Statutory Basis of Rule Proposals and Form Changes </ITAG>These revisions are being proposed pursuant to Section 19 of the SecuritiesAct,\251\<NOTE/> sections 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 23 of the Exchange Act,\252\<NOTE/> and section 304 of the Trust Indenture Act.\253\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\251\ 15 U.S.C. 77s. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\252\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>l</T3>, 78m, 78n, 78<T3>o</T3>, 78p, and 78w. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\253\ 15 U.S.C. 77ddd(d). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Parts 230, 239, 240, 249, 260 and 269.</ITAG>Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, securities. <ITAG tagnum="84">IX.

Simultaneouslywith the publication of this release, the Securities and Exchange Commission(the ``SEC'') is publishing for comment a multijurisdictional disclosurerelease and proposed Rules, Forms and Schedules that would permit Canadianissuers that, depending on the offering, meet market value, public floatand Canadian reporting history tests to register securities in the U.S.using disclosure documents prepared according to the requirements of Canadianregulatory authorities. Canadian issuers meeting tests of market valueand public float also would be able to use Canadian documents to meet U.S.periodic disclosure requirements. In addition, Canadian issuers would beable to use Canadian documents to meet proxy requirements for certain solicitationsand to meet insider reporting requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multijurisdictional disclosure system further would permit thirdparty and issuer share exchange and cash take-over bids/tender offers tobe made in compliance with the provisions of applicable take-over bid regulationsin the target's home jurisdiction where less than 20 percent of the classof securities subject to the offer were held of record by residents ofthe other jurisdiction, whether Canada or the U.S. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SEC Release: Copies of the SEC Multijurisdictional Disclosure SystemRelease are available upon request from the Secretary of the OSC and ofthe CVMQ. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date for Submission of Comments: October 31, 1989 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Reference:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Pamela Hughes, Deputy Director, Legal, Corporate Finance Branch, OntarioSecurities Commission, (416) 593-3653. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Rosetta Gagliardi, Direction de l'information, Commission des valeursmobilieres du Quebec, (514) 873-5326.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">I. Introduction  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. Summary </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Developments in the international securities markets and an increasein the number of securities offerings made across national boundaries haveemphasized the problems caused to issuers by compliance with the securitieslaws of multiple jurisdictions. Attempting to comply with the disclosureprovisions of securities regulators in multiple countries adds expenseand additional time. The additional time may substantially increase cost,since conditions advantageous to the issuer may prevail in the capitalmarkets only for a limited period. Rather than comply with the requirementsof regulators in more than one country, issuers may choose to exclude certainjurisdictions from their offerings, thus excluding investors in that jurisdictionfrom investment opportunities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In 1985, the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') issued SecuritiesAct Release No. 6568 ``Facilitation of Multinational Securities Offerings''requesting comments on two alternative methods of dealing with multijurisdictionalofferings: ``the common prospectus approach'' and the ``reciprocal prospectusapproach''. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A majority of commenters favoured the reciprocal approach. The OSCand the CVMQ in consultation with the other securities regulatory authoritiesin Canada commenced discussions with the SEC in 1987 with a view towardestablishing a system of multijurisdictional disclosure based on the reciprocalapproach. The system as proposed is a hybrid between the reciprocal approachand the common prospectus approach. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The system would permit single-jurisdiction regulation of certainmultiple-jurisdiction securities offerings and continuous reporting obligationsso that such offers may be made more efficiently and at less expense. Thedisclosure document for an offering would be prepared in accordance withthe requirements of the issuer's home jurisdiction. The regulatory authoritiesof the home jurisdiction would be solely responsible for establishing thedisclosure standards for both offering documents and continuous reporting.Regulatory review of the offering disclosure document would be that customaryin that issuer's home jurisdiction and the document generally would begiven a no-review status in the other jurisdiction (the ``receiving jurisdiction'')in which the securities are being distributed. The system would also facilitatecrossjurisdictional debt and equity offerings in which the disclosure documentfor an offering would be prepared in accordance with the requirements ofthe issuer's home jurisdiction and filed solely in the receiving jurisdiction.Issuers would continue to be subject in each jurisdiction where the offerwas made to provisions imposing civil or criminal liability for any materialmisrepresentation or omission in the disclosure document or fraud or manipulationin connection with the offering and would be subject to the authority ofeach securities commission to halt the offering in the public interestand for the protection of investors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multijurisdictional system represents an initial step towardsrecognition of home jurisdiction disclosure requirements by the receivingjurisdiction and would cover debt and equity offerings by ``substantial''issuers and a larger class of rights and exchange offerings, where lessthan 20 percent of the class of securities involved are held of recordby residents of the receiving jurisdiction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multijurisdictional system also extends to regulations applicableto third-party and issuer exchange and cash tender offers made for thesecurities of U.S. issuers in compliance with U.S. tender offer regulations,where less than 20 percent of the shares involved are held of record byCanadian residents and to exchange and cash take-over bids and issuer bidsmade for the securities of Canadian issuers in compliance with Canadiantake-over bid and issuer bid rules, where less than 20 percent of the sharesinvolved are held of record by U.S. residents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">OSC Policy Statement 7.1 <T3>Application of Requirements of the Securities Act to Certain ReportingIssuers </T3>and the CVMQ permit issuers other than those incorporated,organized or continued under the laws of Canada or a province or territoryof Canada, which are subject to the reporting obligations of the SEC underthe Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), to file withthe OSC and CVMQ the continuous disclosure materials filed with the SECin lieu of materials required by the Securities Act (Ontario) (the ``OntarioAct'') and the Securities Act (Quebec) (the ``Quebec Act''). The multijurisdictionalsystem would permit use of Canadian periodic reporting to meet the reportingrequirements of the Exchange Act where (a) such requirements arose solelyby reason of offerings registered on the multijurisdictional forms, or(b) the issuer of the securities met tests of market value and reportinghistory. This would include Annual Information Forms, Annual Reports, ManagementDiscussion and Analysis, annual and interim financial statements, materialchange reports, insider reporting and proxy materials for routine annualmeeting matters. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">At approximately the same time as this proposal is published for comment,the SEC is issuing a release setting forth changes that would permit theimplementation of a multijurisdictional disclosure system to enable issuersto make public offerings and take-over bids in the receiving jurisdictionusing disclosure documents prepared according to home jurisdiction requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multijurisdictional system would not be available with respectto distributions of securities or continuous reporting by mutual fundsin Canada or investment companies required to register under the U.S. InvestmentCompany Act of 1940. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. Canadian Issuers in the United States Market </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Canadian companies are frequent issuers in the U.S. capital markets.ln 1987 and 1988, Canadian issuers made a total of 124 public offeringsin the United States for an approximate total of $10,084,287,000 of which$8,095,023,000 was equity. Canadian companies also have made use of theU.S. shelf registration system. Over $1,761,622,000 of debt securitieshave been registered by Canadian issuers for sale under SEC Rule 415 inthe last three years. As of June 30, 1989, there were 21 Canadian equitieslisted on the New York Stock Exchange, 38 on the American Stock Exchangeand 146 on the National Association of Securities Dealers' Automated Quotationsystem (``NASDAQ''). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. Mutual Recognition and Harmonization </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Efficiency of the capital-raising process would be enhanced greatlyby permitting an issuer to prepare one disclosure document for use in eachjurisdiction in which it chooses to sell securities. There are two primaryapproaches to achieve this goal: harmonization of disclosure standardsand mutual recognition of disclosure standards established in other jurisdictions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Under a harmonization approach, participating jurisdictions wouldagree upon a set of disclosure requirements that would be the same in eachjurisdiction, with the result that a disclosure document prepared pursuantto the requirements of one participating jurisdiction would comply automaticallywith the requirements of all other participating jurisdictions. In additionto reducing costs, a prime benefit of such a system would be to providecomparability of information from issuer to issuer and country to country.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Mutual recognition, on the other hand, would enable an issuer to preparea disclosure document according to the requirements of its home jurisdiction,and to have that document accepted for securities offerings in every otherparticipating jurisdiction. Mutual recognition does not necessarily ensurecomparability from issuer to issuer and country to country. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As proposed, the multijurisdictional disclosure system is a hybridof the two approaches. While it is based on the concept of mutual recognition,the participants will be those jurisdictions whose disclosure systems,while different in detail, in substance provide investors with informationto make an informed investment decision and financial statements of relevanceand reliability. The existence of a well-developed, sophisticated and reliablesystem for administering these requirements is also critical, as the Commissionwill rely primarily on foreign disclosure requirements, application ofdisclosure standards and day-to-day enforcement of those standards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">II. The Proposed System </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">A. Overview and Purpose </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In proposing adoption of the system, the Commissions are taking afirst step rather than providing for multijurisdictional registration anddisclosure in all cases. Limiting the first phase of the system to a relativelylimited number of transactions and issuers will enable the regulators tomonitor use of the system and to address potential problems. At a laterdate, a wider variety of transactions, a greater number of issuers andother jurisdictions may be added. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The system as presently proposed would extend to debt and equity offeringsby ``substantial'' issuers, and to specified rights and exchange offers.All issuers making such offers in Ontario or Quebec pursuant to the systemwould be required to have three-year reporting histories with the SEC andto be in compliance with the reporting requirements of the SEC at the timeof filing. Issuers would also be required, except in the case of rightsofferings, to meet tests of minimum market value or public float. The systemalso would permit compliance with the Exchange Act to suffice for compliancewith the Ontario Act and Quebec Act in the case of takeover bids and issuerbids made to Ontario residents for the securities of U.S. issuers, a limitedpercentage of which are held by Canadian residents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The purpose of the ``substantial'' designation is to single out issuerswhose size is such to suggest that the market operates efficiently in respectof their securities. Such issuers generally have a wide market followingand the marketplace is in a position to set a price on their securitiesbased on all available information. The Commissions have distinguishedbetween investment grade debt and preferred shares, and other securitiesin determining the availability of total reliance on U.S. disclosure. A``substantial'' issuer is defined as one that has a market value of atleast U.S. $150 million in the context of investment grade debt and preferredshares, and U.S. $300 million in the case of other securities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commissions are proposing to rely completely on U.S. disclosuresin the case of investment grade debt and preferred shares. Investment gradedebt and preferred shares would be defined as in Paragraph C.1 and theschedule to O.S.C. Policy Statement 5.6 and under Quebec rules with theexception that convertible debt or convertible preferred shares that arenon-convertible for at least one year from the date of issue would be includedwithin debt or preferred shares. Major factors affecting the trading priceof such securities would be the yield on such securities and the ratingthat they carry. Financial information pertaining to liquidity and capitalresources is most relevant to this investment decision and both U.S. andCanadian GAAP usually provide an adequate basis for an assessment of thisinformation with respect to the ability to repay principal and interestwhen due. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of offerings by substantial issuers of securities otherthan investment grade debt and preferred shares, the Commissions proposeto continue to require financial statement reconciliation, based on thepremise that comparability of financial information, particularly net incomeand shareholders' equity, as a whole and on a per share basis, is of greaterimportance to investment decisions in these securities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Commissions specifically request comment as to whether the differencesin accounting principles are sufficient to warrant reconciliation requirements,or whether Canadian investors would be in an adequate position to makean informed decision on the basis of information contained in U.S. financialstatements. The Commissions also request comment as to whether domesticissuers would be unduly disadvantaged by permitting U.S. issuers to distributeequity in Ontario and Quebec without reconciliation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multijurisdictional registration process also would be extendedto certain rights offers and securities exchange take-over bids (``exchangeoffers''), primarily because of concerns for domestic investors' interests.Rights and exchange offers made in Ontario or Quebec must be filed withthe respective Commission. Foreign issuers making an exchange offer maynot extend the offer to Canadian holders because they are unwilling tobear the costs and other burdens of complying with Canadian take-over laws.Investors are relegated either to selling into the market at less thanthe full tender offer consideration and incurring transaction costs notimposed in the tender offer, or remaining minority shareholders, subjectto the risk of being cashed out in a subsequent merger or arrangement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">It therefore would appear to be in the interests of domestic investorsto facilitate the qualification of such offerings to encourage U.S. issuersto extend such offers to domestic shareholders. Additionally, imposinga duplicative cost on issuers would seem particularly inappropriate wherethe effect on Canada is incidental to a transaction. Where less than 20%of the class of securities to which the rights or exchange offer relatedare held of record by Canadian residents, offers could be made in Ontarioor Quebec pursuant to the system. The percentage of record holders wouldbe determined as of the end of the issuer's last quarter or, if such quarterended within 60 days prior to the date of filing, as of the end of thepreceding quarter.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Rights offerings to Ontario and Quebec investors that already ownthe securities of the issuer are particularly appropriate for multijurisdictionalregistration. Investors reasonably could be expected to proceed to makea further investment based on the same type of information that they reliedupon when they bought the securities in the secondary market. Consistentwith this theory, multijurisdictional registration for rights offeringscould be made available to a larger class of issuers than those designated``substantial''. Comment is requested as to whether rights offers shouldbe permitted to be made pursuant to the system in the event that more than20 percent of the subject securities were held of record by Canadian residents.For example, should the limit be 30, 40 or 50 percent or should there beno limit at all?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of exchange offers, it similarly seems appropriate tofacilitate distribution of securities in Ontario and Quebec so that domesticinvestors are not denied rights of value that are offered to all otherholders of the same class of securities. On the other hand, in non-issuerexchange offers, unlike rights offerings, the investor has not alreadymade an investment decision with respect to the bidder whose securitiesare being offered in the exchange. Due to this difference, the multijurisdictionalregistration system is proposed to extend to exchange offers with highereligibility standards than those applicable to rights offerings. As withrights offerings, multijurisdictional registration would be available wherethe receiving country's investors do not own more than 20% of the outstandingshares of the targeted class. U.S. participants making exchange offers(``bidders'') would be required to have a public float of (U.S.) $75 millionand have a three-year reporting history with the SEC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of exchange offers, a decision to extend offers to Ontarioand Quebec investors depends not only on the application of Ontario andQuebec disclosure requirements but also Ontario and Quebec take-over bidregulation. U.S. issuers conducting tender offers for the shares of U.S.target companies may be deterred from extending both exchange and cashoffers to target shareholders residing in Ontario and Quebec by costs attendantto compliance with Ontario's and Quebec's applicable take-over bid rulesand thus exclude Ontario, Quebec and other Canadian investors from theirtender offers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Rather than protecting Ontario and Quebec investors, the applicationof Ontario and Quebec take-over bid rules to predominantly U.S. tenderoffers thus can operate to deny these investors the opportunity to participatein such transactions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed system would work as follows: when (1) Ontario and/orQuebec constitutes the primary jurisdiction for a bid; and (2) less than20% of the securities of the target corporation are held of record by U.S.residents, then, pursuant to proposed requirements of the SEC under thesystem, the bid must be extended to all U.S. shareholders on the same termsas made to Ontario and/or Quebec shareholders. The bid must be made incompliance with Ontario and/or Quebec law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Similarly, when (1) the U.S. constitutes the primary jurisdictionfor the tender offer; and (2) less than 20% of the securities of the targetcorporation are held of record by Canadian residents, then, pursuant toproposed requirements of the Commissions under the system, the U.S. tenderoffer must be extended to Ontario and/or Quebec shareholders on the sameterms as made to U.S. shareholders. The tender offer must be made in conformitywith the Exchange Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multi-jurisdictional system should reduce disincentives to theinclusion of Canadian shareholders in predominantly U.S. cash or exchangeoffers where less than 20 percent of the subject class was held of recordby Canadian residents. More importantly, because the substantive protectionand disclosure obligations established by the U.S. tender offer regulationsare generally comparable in most respects to those prescribed by the OntarioAct and the Quebec Act, the regulation made thereunder and the Commissions'policy statements, holders of shares in U.S. companies residing in Ontarioor Quebec will not be unduly disadvantaged by comparison with Ontario orQuebec shareholders in domestic companies. To minimize any potential regulatoryinequality, the nationality of a bidder in a cash tender offer would notdetermine availability of the system. Thus, Canadian and U.S. bidders fora U.S. target would be governed by the same tender offer regulation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">B. The Mechanics of the Multijurisdictional Disclosure System</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The aim of the multijurisdictional disclosure system is to enablean issuer to prepare a disclosure document according to the requirementsof its home jurisdiction, and to use that document for a securities offeringin the receiving jurisdiction, either in conjunction with an offering inthe home jurisdiction or solely as an offering in the receiving jurisdiction.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the case of securities offerings made pursuant to the system inCanada by U.S. issuers, U.S. regulatory authorities would be responsiblefor establishing and applying disclosure standards. For offerings madeby U.S. issuers both in the U.S. and Canada, regulatory review of the disclosuredocument would be that customary in the U.S. Thus, except in the unusualcase where the Commission staff had reason to believe there was a problemwith the filing or the offering, the documents generally would be givena ``no review'' status in Ontario and Quebec. Unless the principal jurisdictionspecified by the issuer pursuant to National Policy Statement No. 1 hadreceived notification from another jurisdiction in Canada in which thesecurities were being distributed that it was not prepared to issue a receipt,the principal jurisdiction would issue the receipt for the final prospectusupon notification that the registration statement had been declared effectiveby the SEC. Although U.S. issuers offering securities pursuant to the systemwould not be required to comply with Ontario and Quebec disclosure requirements,they nonetheless would be liable under Ontario and Quebec civil liabilityprovisions for any misrepresentation in the disclosure document. They wouldhave to comply with requirements concerning the language of disclosuredocuments if the offering is made in Quebec. They would also be subjectto the authority of the Commissions to stop the offering in the publicinterest and for the protection of investors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The system would distinguish between the disclosure document requiredto be given to each investor and the documents to be filed with the Commissions.Participating U.S. issuers would be required to provide Ontario and Quebecinvestors with the same information as investors in the home jurisdictionreceive. Information incorporated by reference in the prospectus wouldnot be required to be distributed to investors, but would be deemed partof the prospectus. Investors would be able to obtain such information fromthe Commissions or, upon request, from the issuer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The document delivered to investors, together with all the informationincorporated into that document by reference or filed with the appropriateU.S. regulatory authority or authorities at the same time the disclosuredocument is filed would be required to be filed with the Commissions. Inaddition, documents filed and subsequently incorporated by reference intothe prospectus must also be filed with the Commissions contemporaneouslywith the filing with the SEC. Thus, the prospectus would be subject tosection 70 and section 126 liability under the Ontario Act and all otherprovisions of the securities laws applicable to a prospectus filed underthe Ontario and Quebec Acts. Moreover, the prospectus would be in the publicfiles, available for public review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The issuer would be required to add to the prospectus legends warninginvestors that the investment may have tax consequences in the issuer'sjurisdiction, that investors may have to pursue remedies for any securitieslaw violation against persons and assets located in the issuer's jurisdiction,and that any financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.accounting standards. The issuer would also be required to add a descriptionof purchasers' statutory rights of rescission and damages and issuer'sand underwriters' certificates prepared in accordance with Ontario andQuebec requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The prospectus would be accompanied by a consent to service of processand appointment of an Ontario and a Quebec person as agent for process.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Where debt securities are to be distributed by a U.S. issuer, issuerswould be required to comply with the trust indenture provisions of theBusiness Corporations Act, 1982 (``OBCA''). The Commission intends to issuea blanket ruling pursuant to ss. 46(4) of the OBCA to permit U.S. issuersof debt pursuant to the system to use solely a U.S. trustee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Prospectuses on the proposed forms must be filed with the Commissionson the same day as the filing of the registration statement with the SEC.Any post-effective amendment similarly must be filed on the same day withthe Commissions as an amendment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A prospectus prepared in connection with a contemporaneous offeringin the issuer's home jurisdiction and the receiving jurisdiction wouldbe issued a final receipt on the date the securities legally could be soldin the home jurisdiction. A prospectus filed in connection with an investmentgrade debt, preferred share or equity offering solely in the receivingjurisdiction would be issued a final receipt in Canada or declared effectivein the U.S. seven days after the date of filing of the prospectus in thereceiving jurisdiction. A Canadian issuer making an offering solely inthe U.S. would file the registration statement filed with the SEC contemporaneouslywith the Commissions pursuant to the issuer's continuous disclosure obligations.The Commissions specifically request comment as to whether the proceduresoutlined are likely to result in Canadian issuers that would otherwisehave offered securities in Canada choosing to offer only in the UnitedStates. Registrants making a delayed or continuous debt or equity offeringin the U.S. pursuant to SEC Rule 415 (the shelf registration system) wouldbe able to make a contemporaneous offering in Canada pursuant to the multijurisdictionalsystem. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Whenever a U.S. issuer is subject to a requirement pursuant to Item512(a) of Regulation S-K to file a post-effective amendment, the amendmentwould be filed under subsection 56(l) of the Ontario Act and section 25of the Quebec Act. The amendment would become effective simultaneouslyin the U.S., Ontario and Quebec. A post-effective amendment or supplementdescribing the attributes of specific securities to be taken from the ``shelf''and distributed would not constitute an amendment ``for the purpose ofdistributing securities in addition to the securities previously disclosedin the prospectus'' for the purposes of subsection 56(2) of the OntarioAct and pursuant to sections 62.6 and 62.9 of the Regulations under theQuebec Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The requirement that an amendment to the prospectus be filed doesnot apply to a Form S-3 where the required updating is included in periodicreports that are incorporated by reference into the shelf prospectus. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A prospectus supplement or ``sticker'' reflecting material changes,not comprising fundamental changes under Item 512(a) of Regulation S-K,such as changes in interest rates, redemption prices or maturities wherea shelf prospectus relates to a series of debt offerings or the selectionof the final method of distribution or of any one or more of the underwritersnamed would be filed with the Commissions on the same day as filed withthe SEC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">All shelf prospectuses filed pursuant to the multijurisdictional systemmust be accompanied by an undertaking of the issuer to the Commissionsto file with the Commissions an amendment or supplement whenever requiredby the rules of the SEC. In addition, when a shelf prospectus containsno set plan of distribution or generally states that securities may besold pursuant to one of several distribution methods and does not includean underwriters' certificate, an amendment to the prospectus must be filed,disclosing the material aspects of the plan of distribution including acertificate of the underwriters, prior to the distribution of securitiesunder the prospectus. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">C. Application of the System to Specific Transactions by CanadianIssuers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The following is a detailed discussion of how Canadian issuers couldoffer securities or any offerors could make a cash tender offer in theUnited States under the multijurisdictional disclosure system. These proceduresare equivalent to those proposed by the OSC and the CVMQ for use by U.S.issuers in Canada.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Offerings by Substantial Issuers</T3>_(a) <T3>Offerings of Investment Grade Debt and Preferred Stock (SEC Form F-9).</T3>Multijurisdictional registration would be permitted for offeringsby substantial issuers of non-convertible debt securities or non-convertiblepreferred stock that are investment grade, as defined in the United States.Securities that are not convertible for one year from the date of effectivenessof the registration statement would be treated as non-convertible. Commentis requested as to the treatment of convertible securities. Should theperiod of non-convertibility be longer (e.g. two or three years)? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Offerings of such investment grade securities would be registeredwith the SEC on proposed Form F-9. Form F-9 would be a cover page settingout registration details, including certain prospectus legends and wraparoundthe Canadian prospectus. To be eligible to use that form, an issuer wouldbe required to be incorporated anywhere in Canada, with a total marketvalue for its securities of (CDN.) $180 million and a public float of (CDN.)$75 million. ``Public float'' is the monetary value of all outstandingequity securities owned by non-affiliates, and would be determined accordingto Canadian practice. Non-voting common stock would be included in thecalculation of public float. The (CDN.) $180 million requirement parallelsone of the eligibility standards for use of Form S-3, which permits useof a short-form prospectus in the United States by U.S. issuers. The publicfloat requirement is derived from the Canadian test for eligibility forthe prompt offering qualification system and is based on the Canadian definitionof affiliates in determining the amount of securities publicly held. Theserequirements are expressed in terms of Canadian rather than U.S. currencyso that fluctuations in exchange rates would not affect an issuer's eligibilityto use the Form. The date as of which the issuer must meet the market valueand float tests would be a date within the 30 day period prior to the filingof the registration statement. Form F-9 would not require reconciliationof financial statements from Canadian GAAP to U.S. GAAP. Comment is requestedas to whether the requirements set forth provide adequate indication ofan issuer's market following. Should the market value and public floattests be set at different levels, and if so, should they be higher (forexample, market value of (CDN.) $300 or $500 million, or float of (CDN.)$100 or $300 million) or lower (for example, market value of (CDN.) $100or $75 million or float of (CDN.) $50 or $25 million? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Other Offerings (SEC Form F-10). </T3>Offerings by substantial issuersof securities other than investment grade debt or preferred stock wouldbe registered on proposed Form F-10. In this context, ``substantial issuers''would be those with a market value of (CDN.) $360 million (to approximatethe SEC's requirement that equity issuers eligible to use the Form F-3short form prospectus have a market value of securities of (U.S.) $300million), and a public float of (CDN.) $75 million. Eligibility would bedetermined as of a date within the 30 day period prior to the filing ofthe registration statement. As with Form F-9, comment is requested as tothe appropriateness of the tests for eligibility for Form F-10. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Form F-10 would require reconciliation of financial statements toU.S. GAAP. The reconciliation required would be that specified in Iteml8 of SEC Form 20-F. Item 18 requires the full disclosure of all informationrequired by Regulation S-X and U.S. GAAP, including segment informationand supplemental oil and gas data. Comment is solicited as to whether,if reconciliation is to be required, Item 17 reconciliation should suffice.Should reconciliation of shareholders' equity and net income, as a wholeand on a per share basis, suffice? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Items 17 and 18 of Form 20-F each permit the use of financial statementswhich are in accordance with accounting principles other than those ofthe United States if the items include a discussion of the material variationsfrom United States accounting principles and Regulation S-X and if a quantifiedreconciliation is made as to material variations in net income as presentedand net income under United States accounting principles and as to balancesheet line items and earnings per share. Item 18 calls for a greater amountof detail than does Item 17 as Item 18 asks for all other information requiredby the generally accepted accounting principles of the United States whileItem 17 contains no such provision. Item 17 disclosure may be used forannual reports and registration under the Exchange Act, while Item 18 disclosuregenerally is required in Forms F-l, F-2 and F-3 in connection with thepublic offering of securities in the United States. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the United States, registration statements are subject to certainindustry specific requirements relating to an issuer's business and operations.Foreign issuers generally are held to the same level of disclosure as U.S.domestic issuers. Given Canadian disclosure requirements and practices,the SEC proposes to require only additional industry-specific informationfrom issuers engaged in banking. Canadian banks using Form F-10 would berequired to disclose information substantially equivalent to the informationset out under Item III.C., ``Risk Elements,'' and Item IV., ``Summary ofLoan Loss Experience'' of Industry Guide 3 under the Securities Act of1933. Comment is solicited as to whether this requirement is appropriate.Disclosure would be more extensive than the information proposed in Item3(1)(l) of the Annual Information Form forming part of the Annual InformationForm and Management Discussion and Analysis requirements released for commentin the OSC Bulletin of June 9, 1989 and in the CVMQ Bulletin of June 23,1989. Both the reconciliation and the supplemental Industry Guide 3 informationare required to be included in both the prospectus delivered to investorsand the registration statement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Rights Offers andamp; Securities Exchange Take-over Bids (Exchange Offers)</T3>_(a) <T3>Rights Offers (SEC Form F-7). </T3>Form F-7 is proposed for use byCanadian issuers making rights offerings in the United States. To be eligible,the issuer would have to (1) be incorporated in Canada, and (2) have hadfor the 36 months immediately preceding the offering, a class of securitieslisted on The Toronto Stock Exchange or the Montreal Exchange. Form F-7would not require that registrants meet any test of market value of sharesor public float. Comment is requested as to whether the eligibility testsproposed for use of Form F-7 are appropriate or whether the $75 millionmarket value requirement imposed by Form F-8 should be extended to FormF-7. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Either a rights offering circular filed in Ontario pursuant to paragraph71(1)(h)(i) of the Ontario Act and in Quebec pursuant to section 52(1)of the Quebec Act or a rights offering prospectus may be filed under FormF-7. Since is it intended that Form F-7 would exclude offerings that aremajor financings, an eligible offer, if completely subscribed, could notincrease the capital of the class of securities offered by more than 25percent in number (or, in the case of debt, the principal amount). The25 percent test is derived from OSC Policy Statement 6.2 which uses the25 percent threshold to identify rights offerings subject to prospectusfiling requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. residents must hold of record less than 20 percent of the classof securities to which the rights offering is related. The rights couldnot be transferable to U.S. residents. The underlying securities, however,could be so transferable. The exercise period of the rights must not exceed90 days.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> The securities to be registered on Form F-7 would be those issuableupon the exercise of rights. The rights themselves generally are not registrablein the U.S. on a ``no-sale'' theory. If they were required to be registered,the issuer could register them on Form F-7. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) <T3>Exchange Offers (SEC Form F-8)</T3>_ (i) <T3>Prospectus Issues. </T3>Proposed Form F-8 would be used to registerexchange offers that are primarily Canadian in character, in which allor a portion of the consideration offered is the securities of the bidder,and less than 20 percent of the securities of the target class are heldof record by U.S. residents. The target of the bid would be required tobe incorporated or organized under the laws of Canada or any province orterritory. The aggregate market value of the registrant's common sharesmust equal or exceed (CDN) $75 million. Registrants would be required tohave had their securities listed on The Toronto Stock Exchange or the MontrealExchange for the 36 months immediately preceding the offering. Commentis requested as to whether these eligibility tests are appropriate. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The bidder must offer its securities upon identical terms and conditionsto both U.S. and Canadian shareholders of the target. Adherence to thisrequirement would prevent discrimination among holders of the class ofsecurities that is the subject of the offer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The multi-jurisdictional registration system would enable a qualifiedCanadian reporting issuer planning to commence a non-exempt exchange offerto file its take-over bid circular with the SEC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Contemporaneously with the filing of the take-over bid circular withthe OSC and the CVMQ, a Canadian offeror making an offer pursuant to thesystem would file the circular, accompanied by Forms F-8 and F-X, withthe SEC. The circular would be distributed by mail to shareholders in bothcountries. As in Ontario and Quebec an exchange offer is deemed to commenceupon mailing, it also would commence upon mailing in the United States.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) <T3>Tender Offer Regulation. </T3>Exchange offers also raise the questionof the need for compliance with each jurisdiction's regulatory scheme relatingto take-over bids/tender offers. The multijurisdictional system would providethat, when a Canadian bidder is eligible to use the system for an exchangeoffer, the take-over bid rules of its home jurisdiction would govern, andcompliance with the home jurisdiction rules would be sufficient under theExchange Act. U.S. and other non-Canadian offerors not eligible to useForm F-8 similarly could make exchange offers for the securities of Canadianissuers (where, less than 20 percent of the holders of record of the subjectsecurities were U.S. residents) pursuant to Canadian tender offer regulations.Such non-Canadian issuers, however, would have to comply with U.S. registrationdisclosure requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) <T3>Proxy Regulation. </T3>Any solicitation of U.S. shareholders involvedin the offer and sale of securities registered on Form F-8 would be exemptfrom Exchange Act proxy information and filing requirements pursuant tothe proposed amendment to Rule 3a12-3(c). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Tender Offers Pursuant to the System. </T3>Pursuant to amendments tobe proposed to the SEC's tender offer rules, third-party or issuer tenderoffer filings in connection with offers in both jurisdictions for a classof shares of a Canadian issuer, less than 20 percent of which is held ofrecord by U.S. residents, would be permitted to proceed in the United Statesin compliance with the laws of Ontario and/or Quebec, provided the tenderoffer is extended to all holders of the class of securities in the UnitedStates, and that the transaction is covered by substantive provisions ofCanadian law regulating the terms and conditions of the offer. In theseinstances, compliance with Canadian law would suffice for compliance withthe Exchange Act. Where a bid not covered by such Canadian regulation,for example a stock exchange bid exempt under the Ontario Act and the QuebecAct, was extended to U.S. shareholders, the Exchange Act and the rulesthereunder would govern the conduct of the offer in the United States evenif the bid otherwise would qualify for inclusion in the multijurisdictionalsystem. The schedules would require that the bidder comply with the laws,regulations and policies of any Canadian federal and/or provincial or territorialregulatory agency applicable to the particular offer. If the offeror failedto comply with Canadian law, it would be in violation of both Canadianand U.S. law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The take-over bid circular filed with the OSC and the CVMQ would befiled simultaneously with the SEC, together with the appropriate ``wraparound''forms (F-8 or other Securities Act registration form for exchange offers,Schedule l4D-lF for third party and affiliate tender offers, Schedule 14D-9Ffor the target's response and Schedule 13E-4F for issuer tender offers),and disseminated to all U.S., Ontario and Quebec shareholders. Where anexchange offer was being made pursuant to the system by an offeror noteligible to use Form F-8, U.S. shareholders would receive SEC-mandateddisclosure in addition to the information required to be disseminated underCanadian law. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As discussed, only Canadian companies reporting to Canadian securitiesregulatory authorities would be eligible to register on Form F-8 securitiesissued in connection with an exchange offer. The bidder in an all-cashoffer need not meet the nationality, reporting status and size requirementsthat would be imposed on participating exchange offerors. The target mustbe a Canadian reporting company, less than 20 percent of the subject securitiesof which is held by U.S. residents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The process for conducting an all-cash tender offer under the proposedsystem, whether the offer is made by a third party, the issuer itself orits affiliate, is virtually identical to that outlined above for exchangeoffers. When filing its take-over bid circular or issuer bid circular withhome jurisdiction authorities in Canada, a bidder would file that documentor documents, and any amendments thereto, with the SEC under cover of proposedwraparound forms Schedule 14D-1F (third party or affiliate or insider bids)or Schedule 13E-4F (issuer bids) together with an executed Form F-X. Homecountry filings, including any amendments, would be disseminated to shareholdersin Canada and the United States pursuant to applicable Canadian law, withU.S. shareholders also receiving the appropriate Schedule. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In response to unaffiliated third-party and insider bids, the targetissuer would file with the SEC the document or documents prescribed byCanadian law, including any amendments thereto, coupled with Schedule 14D-9Fand Form F-X. Again, this Schedule and the underlying Canadian documents,and any amendments, would be sent, in the manner prescribed by Canadianlaw, to U.S. shareholders and, without the Schedule, to Canadian shareholders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In cases of tender offers ineligible for multijurisdictional treatmentin the United States because 20 percent or more of the subject shares isheld by U.S. residents, the rules and regulations of the United Statesgenerally would apply. Further, as a policy matter, the OSC, the CVMQ andthe SEC believe it is in the public interest that take-over bids/tenderoffers be extended to all holders of the class of securities in Canadaand the United States, and that efforts to avoid compliance with the otherjurisdictions' regulation by attempting to exclude certain shareholdersfrom the offer are consistent neither with the purposes of either country'slaws nor with the public interest. However, the terms of an exchange offerfor certain, otherwise qualified issuers may conflict with restrictionson foreign ownership imposed by Canadian and United States law. Under circumstanceswhere national policy concerns may militate against application of thebroad principles of equality underlying the multijurisdictional system,the SEC may determine to exercise its exemptive authority to permit a Canadianbidder to issue cash consideration in lieu of securities in connectionwith a concurrent exchange offer made to Canadian holders of the target.Relief thus may be sought from this ``all holders'' policy that otherwisewould mandate the extension of an exchange offer to U.S. shareholders ofthe Canadian target on the identical terms and conditions offered to Canadianshareholders. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">D. Exchange Act Provisions Affecting the Activities of Participantsin Tender and Exchange Offers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SEC Rule 10b-6 generally prohibits a distribution participant from,directly or indirectly, bidding for or purchasing, or attempting to induceothers to purchase, the securities in distribution or any security of thesame class and series or any right to purchase such security (``relatedsecurities''), until the participant's role in the distribution has terminated.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">SEC Rule 10b-13 prohibits a person who is making a cash tender offeror exchange offer for any equity security from, directly or indirectly,purchasing or making any arrangement to purchase such security (or anyother security which is immediately convertible into or exchangeable forsuch security) otherwise than pursuant to the tender offer or exchangeoffer, from the time of announcement of the offer until its expiration,including any extensions thereof. The rule is designed to ``protect shareholdersin the tender offer from the harmful effects of purchases or arrangementsmade outside, and on terms or conditions different from, the tender offer,and to protect the integrity of the tender offer process by proscribingside deals that could render the tender offer a sham.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Canadian rules permit participants in transactions contemplated byproposed Form F-8 and Schedules 14D-1F and 13E-4F to engage in certainactivities that are prohibited by Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13. For example,Canadian rules permit, in limited circumstances, purchases by an offerorduring a take-over bid, or by an issuer during an issuer bid otherwisethan pursuant to a circular bid. Such purchases are permitted from thethird business day following the date of the bid until its termination.Purchases are conditioned upon limiting the amount of securities acquiredto five percent of the outstanding securities as of the date of the bid,disclosing the intention to make such purchases in the third party or issuerbid circular, and issuing and filing a press release with the relevantexchange or regulatory commission at the close of each day on which securitieshave been purchased (subsection 93(3) of the Act and Regulation 169 andsection 142 of the Quebec Act). The press release is required to disclosethe purchaser, the number of shares purchased, the highest price paid onthat day, the average price paid for the securities that were purchasedby the purchaser through the facilities of the stock exchange during thebid, and the total number of securities owned by the purchaser as of theclose of business of the stock exchange on that day. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In connection with the proposed multijurisdictional disclosure system,the SEC is considering publication of no-action positions with respectto Rules 10b-6 and 10b-13. The contemplated no-action positions would applysolely to tender and exchange offers on Form F-8 and Schedules 14D-1F and13E-4F, and would permit securities purchases that are permitted in Canadaand that are not made for the purposes of creating actual or apparent tradingactivity in or of raising the price of such securities. The no-action positionswould apply to: (1) With respect to cash tender offers, purchases of thesecurities which are the subject of the offer and any other security thatis a right to purchase such security or is immediately convertible intoor exchangeable for such security (``target securities''); and (2) withrespect to exchange offers, the purchases of target securities and bidsfor and purchases of the securities offered by the bidder or issuer (``offeredsecurities''), and any security of the same class and series or any rightto purchase any such offered securities (collectively, ``subject securities'').The proposed no-action positions would be available to issuers and biddersthat: (1) Disclose in the Form F-8 and Schedules 13E-4F and 14D-1F thepossibility of, or the intent to make, purchases of subject securitiesoutside the offer as permitted by applicable Canadian regulations; and(2) submit an undertaking to disclose in the U.S. information regardingpurchases of subject securities on the same basis as it is required tobe disclosed or otherwise is disclosed pursuant to Canadian statutory andregulatory requirements. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">E. Proxy and Insider Reports </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Canadian issuers that currently are eligible to use Form 20-F arenot subject to U.S. proxy regulation. All other Canadian issuers, however,must comply with both Canadian and U.S. proxy regulations when they solicitU.S. residents. In connection with the implementation of the system, theSEC proposes to amend certain of the proxy rules to allow compliance byCanadian issuers with Canadian proxy rules to suffice for U.S. purposes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The SEC's proxy rules provide that, if an issuer is soliciting proxiesfor an annual meeting at which the only matters being voted upon includesuch routine items as the election of directors or/and ratification orapproval of accountants, only definitive proxy statements must be filedwith the SEC. Thus, no filing of preliminary materials is required. Ifa Canadian issuer falls within the provisions of this rule so that onlydefinitive material is required to be filed, the amendments to SEC Rule14a-6 would provide that the proxy material need only be prepared in accordancewith Canadian requirements. If, however, the matters to be voted on wouldrequire the filing of preliminary proxy materials in the United States,then a Canadian issuer subject to U.S. proxy rules would be required toprepare the proxy statement in accordance with U.S. rules.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An additional area affected by the proposed rule changes would bethat of shareholder proposals. An amendment to Rule 14a-8 under the ExchangeAct would provide that any Canadian issuer subject to U.S. proxy rulesthat complied with applicable Canadian shareholder proposal rules wouldbe deemed to have complied with the requirements of Rule 14a-8. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Directors, officers and principal stockholders of Canadian and otherforeign private issuers eligible to use Form 20-F are not subject to Section16 of the Exchange Act. In a situation somewhat analogous to the case ofproxy regulation, Canadian persons that are in certain relationships witha Canadian foreign private issuer must comply with both Canadian and U.S.reporting requirements. The SEC is proposing a new Rule 16a-12 that wouldprovide that only persons required to report their securities holdingsin Canada would be required to report to the SEC, and the reporting obligationswith the SEC could be met by furnishing the report filed with the Canadianauthorities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">F. Continuous Disclosure </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Issuers that make a registered offering of securities in the UnitedStates, or that have a certain number of shareholders in the United States,are subject to reporting requirements under the Exchange Act. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, as supplemented by Regulation 15D,requires each issuer that has filed a registration statement that has becomeeffective under the Securities Act to file periodic reports thereafter.Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act requires each issuer that has securitiesregistered under Section 12 of that Act to file periodic reports. Securitiesmay be registered under Section 12 for two reasons. Section 12(b) of theExchange Act requires registration of any class of securities, whetherdebt or equity, that is listed on a national securities exchange. Section12(g) requires issuers to register any class of equity securities heldof record by 500 or more persons if certain tests are met. Foreign privateissuers are exempt from the requirements of Section 12(g) if they havefewer than 300 U.S. holders. Rule 12g3-2(b) provides a further exemptionfrom section 12(g). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Non-Canadian issuers both register their securities with the SEC andfile annual reports on Form 20-F, and furnish current reports on Form 6-K.Form 20-F is available to Canadian issuers for the initial registrationof securities under section 12(g), and for the annual reports of issuersso registered. However, since it is not available for annual reports byissuers that have a reporting obligation under sections 12(b) or 15(d),most Canadian issuers currently file annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterlyreports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any section 15(d) obligation resulting from use of the proposed formsfor any of the transactions covered by the proposed forms could be metby filing with the SEC under cover of proposed Form 40-F, the periodicdisclosure documents required in Canada. These would include Annual InformationForms, Annual Reports, Management Discussion and Analysis, annual and interimfinancial statements and material change reports. Documents would be filedwith the SEC at the same time as they were filed with the OSC and the CVMQ.No reconciliation of financial statements would be required. All Canadiandisclosure documents filed with the SEC would be subject to antifraud liability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Canadian issuers that incur registration or reporting obligationsunder section 12(g) generally would be required to fulfill those obligationsby filing regular SEC continuous disclosure forms. The proposed systemwould, however, permit issuers that met the tests for eligibility for useof Form F-10 (i.e., that had an aggregate market value for their securitiesof $360 million and a public float of $75 million), regardless of whetherthey had made offerings pursuant to the system (``F-10 issuers''), to complywith section 12(g) continuous disclosure requirements by filing the equivalentCanadian documents under cover of Form 40-F. Reconciliation of financialstatements would be required, but (as in annual reports on Form 20-F) thisreconciliation would be to Item 17 of Form 20-F rather than to Item 18.The Commissions request comment as to whether there are distinct reasonsnot to require reconciliation for Exchange Act reporting purposes. TheCommissions also request comment as to whether the multijurisdictionaldisclosure system and use of Form 40-F should be extended to all Canadianissuers reporting under section 12(g).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As is the case with F-10 issuers, Canadian issuers that met the testfor eligibility for use of Form F-9 (i.e., that had an aggregate marketvalue for the securities of $180 million and a public float of $75 million),even if they had not made an offering pursuant to the system (``F-9 issuers''),could comply with section 12(g) continuous disclosure requirements thatarose in connection with non-convertible investment grade preferred stockby filing Canadian periodic reporting documents under cover of Form 40-F.Reconciliation of financial statements would not be required.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The exemption from section 12(g) provided by Rule 12g3-2(b) wouldcontinue to exist and would be unaffected by adoption of the multijurisdictionalsystem. When a Canadian issuer currently furnishing Canadian disclosuredocuments to the SEC pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b) extended an offer intothe United States, it would become subject to the periodic reporting requirementsof Section 15(d), which it would meet by filing with the SEC the same documentsas it presently furnishes under Rule 12g3-2(b). However, civil liabilityunder the Exchange Act would now attach to those filings, where no suchliability existed before.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Section 12(b) registration and reporting obligations would be treatedsimilarly under the system to obligations arising under section 12(g).Canadian issuers that have a class of securities listed on an exchangewould have to file SEC continuous disclosure documents. F-10 issuers andF-9 issuers of non-convertible investment grade debt or non-convertibleinvestment grade preferred stock, however, would be able to comply withtheir section 12(b) reporting obligations by filing the appropriate Canadianforms. If the class of securities listed were investment grade debt orpreferred shares, no reconciliation of financial statements would be required,while if equity securities were listed, Item 17 reconciliation would berequired.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">G. State Securities Regulation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to complying with the federal securities laws, issuersselling their securities in the United States are subject to the securitieslaws of the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Generally,these laws require state registration of offerings made to persons in thestate.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In most jurisdictions, the registration statement filed with the SECwill also satisfy the state filing requirements. The filings are subjectto review by each of the states, as to the adequacy of the disclosure and,in many states, for compliance with additional substantive standards. Forexample, a state may have the authority to deny registration if the offeringinvolves excessive ``cheap stock'' to promoters, excessive options or warrants,unreasonable underwriters' compensation, or excessive dilution, or if aclass of common stock lacks voting rights.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Various exemptions from registration under state law are available;the two most relevant to the multijurisdictional disclosure process arethat for rights offerings and that for securities traded in specified marketplaces.The former exemption is usually limited to rights which are either nontransferableor exercisable for only a limited period of time. The marketplace exemptionsgenerally apply to securities listed on the New York and American StockExchanges, and in some instances on specified regional exchanges, or designatedas National Market System securities and quoted on NASDAQ. Securities ofthe same issuer which are senior to securities included in an exempt marketplaceare also exempt.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Two factors have operated to produce considerable uniformity amongthe states. First, the securities laws of most states are modeled afterthe Uniform Securities Act. Second, the North American Securities AdministratorsAssociation (``NASAA'') proposes uniform guidelines and procedures whichare frequently adopted by many of its member states. Notwithstanding thesefactors, the specific requirements for offering and selling securitiesin any state will be governed by that jurisdiction's statute, rules andpolicies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In April 1989, NASAA adopted a Statement on Internationalization ofthe Securities Markets, in which it urged securities regulators to ``encouragelegitimate capital raising activities across national borders,'' subjectto ``minimum rules to ensure investor protection.'' Consistent with thatStatement, NASAA has formed a special task force to work with the Commission,the CVMQ and the SEC to determine what accommodations would be appropriateat the state level to facilitate use of the multijurisdictional disclosureprocess.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">III. Request for Comments</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Any interested person wishing to submit written comments on any aspectof the multijurisdictional disclosure system is requested to do so.

Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">To evaluate fully the benefits and costs associated with the proposedmultijurisdictional registration system, the Commissions request issuers,underwriters and their counsel and auditors to provide views and data asto the costs and benefits associated with multijurisdictional offeringsunder current law as compared to such costs and benefits under the proposedsystem.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-17857 Filed 8-3-89; 8:45am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8010-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
