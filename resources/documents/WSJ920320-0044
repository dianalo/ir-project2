As a result of the weak performance, Hoogovens said itwouldn't pay a 1991 dividend. In 1990, the company's payoutwas 4.40 guilders a share.   Hoogovens Chairman Oliver van Royen said the company would&quot;favor any kind of cooperation,&quot; for both its steel andaluminum divisions. He said that talks are in progress with anumber of potential partners, and that Hoogovens is mainlyinterested in dealing with other European companies. Mr. vanRoyen said cooperation is essential because of theincreasingly competitive environment in which the companyoperates.   Mr. van Royen indicated that a turnaround also depends ona general economic recovery, and noted that some positivesigns are now emerging from the U.S. He added that higherprices for the company's steel and aluminum products are&quot;really necessary at this moment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
