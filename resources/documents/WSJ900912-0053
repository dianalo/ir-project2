Joseph Biden got a possible Borking started yesterdayby attacking David Souter as an &quot;interpretivist.&quot; Sen. Bidenreferred to the &quot;harshest&quot; followers &quot;under this commonbanner,&quot; citing Judge Learned Hand and Justice Hugo Black. Bytrying to smear these hitherto honored judges, Sen. Bidenapparently wants to push the &quot;mainstream&quot; far out enough toexclude any nominee who cares at all what the Constitutionsays.   Indeed, even Justice William Brennan in the foreward toJustice Black's 1986 memoirs said his place in the &quot;pantheonof great Justices of the Supreme Court grows more and moresecure with each passing year.&quot; Under Sen. Biden's radicalnew litmus test, would even Justice Brennan be qualified toreplace Justice Brennan?</LP><TEXT>   Sen. Biden's efforts aside, there probably won't be anysurprises along the way to Justice Souter. No one imagines hewould be a judicial activist eager to find shadows, penumbrasor emanations of the Constitution. What we don't know is howseriously Judge Souter would take his obligation to upholdthe Constitution.   That is, will his understanding of the original meaning ofthe Constitution come first? Or will he feel obliged tofollow even illegitimate prior cases?   This question of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, or following precedent,has never been so important. Many Supreme Court opinions nowon the books ignore the Constitution. To the extent thesecases offer rules (as opposed to vague five-prong tests andmultilayer balancing factors), these rules are ofquestionable validity. With a new conservative majority, theexcesses of judicial activism will erode quickly or slowly,depending on how bound the justices feel to the illegitimateprecedents of the past 30 years.   The current ground rules are clear. Conservative judgesare supposed to adhere to precedent, which liberal judges arefree to ignore. Federal Appeals Judge Richard Posner explainsthat many conservatives accept the argument that &quot;a goodliberal judge gives little weight to precedents that are notliberal, but a conservative judge gives great weight to allprecedents, liberal as well as conservative.&quot; This createswhat Judge Posner calls a &quot;built-in ratchet&quot; so that &quot;the lawwill necessarily grow more liberal.&quot;   This double standard is no exaggeration. Any doubtersshould consider the answer a judicial nominee gave when asenator asked what he would do if clear prior law or casesrequired a ruling that &quot;offended your own conscience&quot;:   &quot;If I were faced with a situation like that, that ranagainst my conscience, I would try to find a way to follow myconscience and do what I perceive to be right and just. Notthat, I would hope not, it would mean I would actarbitrarily. I was born and raised in this country, and I amsteeped in its traditions, its mores, its beliefs, and itsphilosophies; and if I felt strongly in a situation likethat, I feel it would be the product of my very being andupbringing. I would follow my conscience.&quot;   This was the response by Harry Pregerson, now a federalappeals judge in California, but it is typical of the viewsof many liberals Jimmy Carter appointed who promised not tolet the Constitution get in the way. Imagine if Judge Soutersaid any such thing.   Judge Souter wasn't often confronted by this kind ofjudicial activism when he was on the New Hampshire SupremeCourt, but a review of his some 200 opinions finds about adozen cases where the issue played a large role. There is noliberal-conservative pattern, but he does show somewillingness to consider whether earlier cases were based onany authority.   For example, he overturned an earlier New Hampshire casefor which he could &quot;perceive no intellectually realisticbasis.&quot; As a result, he raised the burden of proof in civilproceedings for committing people to mental institutions upto the level required in criminal proceedings. In anothercase, he dissented from an opinion abolishing special feesfor probate court. Reading the state constitutional clause&quot;as it was understood when the framers proposed it and thepeople ratified it&quot; in 1784, he said, it was clear that theprohibition against payments was to stop bribery of judges,not to outlaw regular statutory fees.   In a case that decided a later owner with no contractcould still sue a builder for latent defects, Judge Souterissued a one-sentence dissent, &quot;Because I am not satisfiedthat there is an adequate justification to repudiate therationale unanimously adopted by this court a mere two yearsago.&quot; In another case, he enforced precedents on levels ofworker's compensation. &quot;Our obligation is to construe thestatute, not to render its language meaninglessly protean,&quot;he wrote.   It's important to remember that &quot;stare decisis&quot; is amethod, not a principle. That is, throughout Anglo-Americanjurisprudence, judges have abided by the reasoning in earliercases as a way to thread cases into one predictable rule oflaw. Indeed, until recently, the duty of &quot;stare decisis&quot; wasthe best guarantee that judges would not make up the lawwilly-nilly.   Then liberal judges systematically rejected any obligationto precedent. This helps explain the recent breakdown in tortand contract law. Justice William Brennan refused to upholdany death penalty. He knew he was making policy instead ofapplying the Constitution, but said he found &quot;flexibilitywith respect to the call of `stare decisis'.&quot; Indeed, liberaljustices established the rule that a precedent can turn intoa pumpkin after 24 hours. On a Wednesday this past June, theSupreme Court upheld the Arizona death penalty. On theThursday, the liberal minority took advantage of the factthat two conservative justices had to recuse themselves, andinvalidated the same death-penalty law.   There is one good reason to abandon &quot;stare decisis&quot; whendeciding a case. This is when the precedent itself is notpart of any seamless web of judicial interpretation, butinstead is pure judicial lawmaking. Why use a tool meant tohonor precedents to uphold a precedent that itself ignoredlong lines of precedent?   Justice Antonin Scalia made a similar point in a dissentin a death-penalty case last year. Justice Scalia said heopposed a two-year-old ruling that a jury can't take intoaccount a victim impact statement when deciding whether toorder the death penalty. &quot;I think it would be a violation ofmy oath to adhere to what I consider a plainly unjustifiedinstrusion upon the democratic process in order that thecourt might save face,&quot; he wrote. Except for a few decisionsthat &quot;have become so embedded in our system of government,&quot;Justice Scalia said the court should not hesitate to excisean unjustifiable precedent. &quot;We provide far greaterreassurance of the rule of law by eliminating than byretaining such a decision.&quot;   When asked, Judge Souter might say that what counts isthat a precedent was a good-faith effort to apply theConstitution, not a judge's &quot;conscience&quot; or his policy views.If a judge in an earlier case ignored the Constitution, heshould expect no presumption of &quot;stare decisis&quot;.</TEXT></DOC>
