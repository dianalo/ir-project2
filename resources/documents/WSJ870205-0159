For moral support, he had brought along his mother, two sisters, a girlfriend and a niece. He had come to turn himself in to columnist Chuck Stone.    While they all waited for police detectives to arrive, Mr. Stone talked with the suspect and comforted his relatives, offering them soft drinks and food. &quot;When you go to Chuck Stone,&quot; says Adelaide Whitfield, the suspect's 67-year-old mother, &quot;you can rest assured that the person who is being turned in will be treated right by the police.&quot;    Many criminals apparently share that view. Over the past decade, 42 suspects have surrendered to the bow-tied, crew-cut Mr. Stone, who writes passionately about the faults of politicians and the weaknesses of the criminal-justice system. Twenty-three of the 42 were wanted for murder.    The tally also includes escaped convicts and men who have held hostages at gunpoint. In 1981, Mr. Stone risked his own life to help free six hostages held in the kitchen of a Pennsylvania prison by a gang of inmates led by a triple murderer.    These aren't the kind of fans most people would want. But the 62-year-old columnist, who is black, like 40 of the 42 people who have surrendered to him, says that they generally &quot;aren't really bad people in the classic sense.&quot; The people who seek his help usually come from &quot;nice families,&quot; he says, and their cases often involve arguments that end in violence, rather than premeditated crimes.    Mr. Stone listens, shows sympathy and frets about the pain their families feel. &quot;I'm aware of the dual tragedy -- what it does to the victim's family and what it does to the criminal's family,&quot; he says. &quot;White society doesn't see that.&quot;    In fact, Mr. Stone sees himself as an &quot;ombudsman for the brothers.&quot; As a journalist, he says, he has the duty to vigorously defend the rights of oppressed people. He often writes more than his regularly scheduled two columns a week.    &quot;He's a guy with real deep beliefs,&quot; says Zachary Stalberg, the editor of the Daily News, the 345,000-circulation tabloid that publishes Mr. Stone's column. &quot;He's not just moving from story to story. For Chuck, it all fits into some big picture.&quot;    Mr. Stone isn't soft on crime. He refuses to help rapists, and he favors the death penalty for premeditated killings. But he gets involved with so many murderers who are black, he explains, because he believes that their fears of being beaten by the police are legitimate.    The police, of course, dispute any suggestion of brutality, but they accept Mr. Stone's help. &quot;I don't care if it's because they think Chuck Stone is the best-looking guy in Philadelphia,&quot; says Police Commissioner Kevin M. Tucker. &quot;If fewer people get hurt, I welcome his support.&quot; A captain in the department points out, however, that Mr. Stone has handled the surrenders of only &quot;minute numbers&quot; of suspects compared with the numbers handled through regular police channels.    The surrenders have helped make Mr. Stone, whose column now is nationally syndicated, a celebrity around town. Nearly everywhere he goes, people recognize his face or his trademark crew cut, Brooks Brothers suits and bow ties. &quot;Walking down the street with Stone is like walking down the street with Liz Taylor,&quot; says Mr. Stalberg.    On a bitter cold afternoon recently, several people stopped to chat with the columnist as he strolled through a tough, low-income neighborhood. On one corner, a man with a cigarette behind one ear explained that Mr. Stone is as well-known in Philadelphia as President Reagan and is better-liked than Mayor Wilson Goode. On another corner, a man with a mustache walked away from the warmth of a barrel of burning wood to shake Mr. Stone's hand. &quot;I don't know what we'd do without you,&quot; he said.    Some detractors -- including several journalists -- complain that the columnist is just out to promote himself. A few years ago, Mr. Stone created quite a stir by sharply criticizing U.S. Rep. William Gray in print while considering a bid to unseat the congressman. Mr. Stone says now that he wasn't serious about running for office. He expressed interest at the time, he says, only because of a &quot;devilish streak&quot; he developed while working in the 1960s as an aide to the late Adam Clayton Powell, the controversial congressman from Harlem who was kicked out of office for misusing public funds.    Others grumble about what they see as a pattern of vicious attacks by Mr. Stone on black politicians. One of his current targets is Mr. Goode, the city's first black mayor. Both Mr. Goode and Mr. Gray, who is also black, decline to comment. But Henry Nicholas, a black union leader and confidant of the mayor, complains that Mr. Stone's work &quot;goes beyond criticism -- it borders on a mission to destroy black political leaders.&quot;    Mr. Stone concedes that his criticism of the mayor is sometimes &quot;a little harsh.&quot; But, he says, he can't condone Mr. Goode's role in the 1985 police bombing of a house occupied by the radical group known as Move. In the fire that ensued, six black adults and five black children died. Mr. Stone attributes Mr. Goode's continued popularity among blacks to his skin color, which the columnist calls &quot;a deceptive cover for his manifold failures.&quot;    Despite his tough tone, the columnist has a soft spot in his heart for mothers. He is especially fond of Princess Marie Bowen -- Princess is her name, not a title -- whose son &quot;Jo-Jo&quot; led the prison gang involved in the 1981 hostage incident. Mrs. Bowen, he says, is &quot;dignity personified.&quot; When he travels, he sends her post cards. He visits her on holidays.    On Christmas Day, he appeared on her doorstep bearing a scarf as a gift. Once inside, he sank into a big armchair and reminisced with Mrs. Bowen, who is 73 years old, about people they both know. They talked briefly about her son, but Mrs. Bowen soon started bragging about her grandchildren.    The columnist's first encounter with her son wasn't so pleasant. They met when Mr. Bowen pointed a double-barreled shotgun at Mr. Stone during the prison hostage crisis. For the better part of two days the columnist sat on a metal folding chair and negotiated terms of the hostages' release. He says he was so emotionally drained after the incident that he had to dictate his column because his fingers didn't work well enough for him to type. For weeks, he adds, &quot;I couldn't stand up without my toes curling.&quot;    Mr. Stone used to rendezvous with criminals in bars, parking lots or housing projects. Once he even drove to Brooklyn in the middle of the night to pick up a man accused of killing a Philadelphia police officer. Nowadays, though, he is more cautious. When suspects call seeking to surrender, they must come to his office and submit to a screening interview with the newspaper's security chief.    All this surrendering began in October 1977, when a 27-year-old murder suspect named Robert &quot;Chuckie&quot; Johnson called wanting to give himself up. Mr. Stone wrote a big story about the case, and Mr. Johnson's picture appeared on the front page of the Daily News.    Now on parole after serving eight years for killing a friend, Mr. Johnson is a bit shy and overweight. He sells bath oils and is studying to become a machinist. He turned to Mr. Stone, he says, because he had a hunch the columnist could be trusted.    &quot;All I wanted was a chance to give my side of the story,&quot; he says. &quot;I wasn't expecting him to pull no strings.&quot;    Mr. Johnson says he feared being beaten or harassed by the police. &quot;If I had somebody with a pen in their hand,&quot; he recalls thinking, &quot;I wouldn't have to go through all that.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
