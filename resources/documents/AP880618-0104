John McCain,R-Ariz., levelled from Tennessee and Florida that Dukakis is a``Teddy Kennedy liberal'' who is soft on crime: ``They send someguy from Arizona to Florida who doesn't know beans from brownbread.''      SEN. SAM NUNN of Georgia, asked if he would accept a spot on thepresidential ticket with Dukakis if invited: ``I think it's verypresumptuous to sort of set up a hypothetical example of what onewould do if one were offered something that one is not seeking andone is discouraging.''      GEORGE BUSH, on allegations of widespread bribery and corruptionat the Pentagon: ``Corruption anywhere in government is bad enough,but these people, should the allegations prove true, were not juststealing money from the Treasury, they were stealing from ournational defense and undermining our national security.''</TEXT></DOC>
