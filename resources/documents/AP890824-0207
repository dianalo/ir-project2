(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The search for an oil substitute haslost much of its urgency, but researchers in Florida, Texas andHawaii believe they are getting closer to the day when hydrogen isas common as gasoline.   They view hydrogen as the fuel of the future, a replacement forall fossil fuels _ not only in cars but in the home, in industry andelsewhere.   ``The arguments for development of hydrogen resources areirrefutable,'' said David Block, director of the Florida SolarEnergy Center, one of the four facilities trying to come up withmethods to produce hydrogen inexpensively on a large scale, use itto generate power, and store it.   Hydrogen is one of the most abundant elements. It can beseparated from its chemical combinations _ like water _ in a numberof ways. It won't pollute the environment and in fact, scientistsworking on the project say, can help stave off the global warmingblamed in part on the effect of burning fossil fuels.   Perhaps the best-known use is on space shuttles, which burn385,000 gallons of supercold liquid hydrogen, mixed with liquidoxygen, to reach orbit.   Participating in the federally funded research project with theFlorida Solar Energy Center are scientists at the Clean EnergyResearch Institute at the University of Miami, the Center forElectrochemical Systems and Hydrogen Research at Texas Aandamp;MUniversity and the Hawaii Natural Energy Institute.   ``Hydrogen can be produced now. The problem is that the cost isprohibitive'' for everyday consumer use, said John Appleby, whoheads the Texas Aandamp;M effort to use photovoltaic cell structures tomake hydrogen to use in cars. He, too, believes using hydrogen isimportant to curtail the greenhouse effect.   ``We feel that the way to go in the future would be nonpollutingvehicles powered by fuel cells using hydrogen, to get rid of thepollution once and for all,'' said Appleby, a professor of appliedelectrochemistry. ``The cost would be reasonable to the consumer andthe cost to society wouldn't exist.''   However, efforts to come up with an economically affordablehydrogen fuel cell _ or produce hydrogen by a variety of othermethods _ ``will take forever. We're talking well after the year2000,'' Appleby said.   One problem is the government's lukewarm support, politically andfinancially, for research efforts, some scientists say. While thegovernment says is is spending $30 million a year for hydrogenresearch, only $2.4 million a year goes to the four institutionsseeking economical ways to produce a fuel.   ``The rest of the money is for fusion reactors and involveshydrogen isotopes,'' said Appleby. ``Fusion research has absolutelynothing to do with fuel in the hands of the ordinary person.''   Block believes there must be a gradual transition from gasolineto hydrogen in automobiles, using combinations of various fuelsbefore there can be a total conversion to hydrogen. FSEC plans todevelop a vehicle fueled by a mixture of methane and hydrogen,providing fuel economy, power and lower emission levels.   FSEC scientists are studying a combination thermochemical andelectrochemical processes to produce the element economically. Andthey are trying to identify the most promising of thehydrogen-production technologies.   Their work so far shows that separating water into its elementsof hydrogen and oxygen can best be accomplished using solar energy,Block said.   The Hawaiian facility is working on using biomass, or vegetation,and ocean water as possible hydrogen production sources, among otherprojects.   Researchers at the University of Miami are devising ways to usehydrogen, along with assessing the economics involved.   Among the chief concerns of scientists involved in research anddevelopment of alternative fuels are the uncertainties of futuresupplies and costs of oil. But hydrogen supporters are increasinglyciting the greenhouse effect and acid rain as reasons for a strongnational effort to develop hydrogen as a fuel.   The burning of fossil fuels such as oil and coal is steadilyreleasing massive amounts of carbon and other heat-trapping gasesinto the atmosphere. Some scientists say this may eventually lead toa climatic catastrophe.   ``If we want a planet worth saving in 50 years,'' Block said,``We've got to find a suitable replacement for fossil fuels.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Aug. 28</NOTE></DOC>
