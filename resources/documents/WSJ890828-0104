A new well drilled to assess the Barents Sea find showed it could be several times larger than Norway's Troll Field, previously the biggest-known offshore deposit, reported the newspaper, Stavanger Aftenbladet.    Researchers from Norway's private Fridtjof Nansen Institute told the newspaper that they learned details of the find during a visit to Moscow's Academy of Science. The newspaper said the information was confirmed by other Norwegian sources.    The field holds an estimated three trillion to four trillion cubic meters of natural gas, compared with the 1.3 trillion cubic meters at Troll, Aftenbladet reported.    The field is in the Soviet-controlled eastern Barents Sea, at about 74 degrees north latitude, said the report. </TEXT></DOC>
