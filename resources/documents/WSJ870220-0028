A gossip column in the New York Post reported he said just that. Mr. Puttnam, however, swears he never said it. And Nigel Sinclair, one of the hosts at the luncheon where the remark was allegedly made two weeks ago, calls the column item &quot;complete balderdash.&quot;    Whatever the facts, in a business where big egos bruise easily and rumors are often taken as truth, Mr. Puttnam has reason for concern. Mr. Murray's agents have made it clear that their client is very unhappy with Mr. Puttnam -- and Mr. Murray is crucial to Columbia's planned sequel to the 1984 blockbuster &quot;Ghostbusters.&quot;    The uproar typifies the controversy that has been swirling around Mr. Puttnam since he took charge of the Coca-Cola film unit last October. A vociferous critic of Hollywood's big-spending ways, the 46-year-old British film maker vows to tackle the spiraling costs of making movies by trimming budgets and rejecting what he sees as inflated salary demands of stars and producers. Moreover, he maintains that his movies will set higher quality standards than the typical Tinseltown fare.    If Mr. Puttnam succeeds at the ambitious task he has set for himself, Columbia could well lead a fundamental change in the way Hollywood does business. But many question whether he is qualified for the job of remaking Hollywood. While he has produced some 30 films -- including &quot;The Mission,&quot; &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; and the Academy Award-winning &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; -- he has never held an executive post with a U.S. studio, much less run a company with a release schedule of 15 or more films and a budget of over $200 million annually. He also says he plans to leave after his three-year contract expires -- the time it often takes to get a movie from the development stage to the screen.    Meanwhile, Mr. Puttnam's outspoken style and his fights with key industry players may hamper his effectiveness as an executive. His criticisms of Hollywood icons Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman, for example, have &quot;incensed&quot; the stars, according to their attorney, Bertram Fields; they have refused to let him see their film &quot;Ishtar,&quot; which Columbia is due to release in May after spending $40 million to produce it.    A number of studio executives agree with much of what Mr. Puttnam says and have been working within their own companies to combat the problem -- with good reason. The average movie budget, less than $10 million a few years ago, has escalated to $16.4 million. And big stars can command salaries of well over $5 million per movie. &quot;I think David's good for the industry, and I'm glad he's at Columbia,&quot; says Robert Daly, the chairman of Warner Communications Inc.'s Warner Bros. unit, which suspended its long-term production contract with Mr. Puttnam to allow him to take the Columbia post.    Mr. Puttnam's detractors, however, note that his own compensation is nothing to sneeze at even by Hollywood standards; industry sources say he could earn more than $10 million in three years. And he has been accused of reverse snobbery in his public disdain of the movie-mogul life style. For example, he shuns Hollywood's power restaurants, told an interviewer he searched for a modest house without a pool (he found the modest house and moved in even though it had a pool) and rejected the Mercedes that goes along with his job in favor of an Audi. He has been married to the same woman for 25 years.    For Coke, hiring Mr. Puttnam appears to be its last shot at turning Columbia around. Although Coke's entertainment division is profitable because of its television operations, Columbia, acquired in 1981, has suffered through a series of management changes and a string of expensive flops. Under the previous chief executive, Guy McElwaine, the studio lost money on its entire 1985 release schedule.    While Columbia was floundering, however, Coke acquired or provided seed money for a half-dozen other entertainment concerns. For example, its 40%-owned Tri-Star Pictures has released such films as &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married,&quot; &quot;About Last Night&quot; and &quot;Nothing in Common,&quot; all of which appeal to broad teen and young-adult audiences.    The head of a rival studio observes that with these other ventures in place, &quot;Coke seems willing to let Columbia become, in effect, the David Puttnam Co.,&quot; reflecting the executive's distinctly highbrow tastes. For example, while Tri-Star distributes Sylvester Stallone's &quot;Rambo&quot; movies and profits handsomely from them, Mr. Puttnam says he made it clear to Coke executives he wouldn't make &quot;Rambo&quot; even if he had an ironclad guarantee it would be a hit.    At Coke, Francis T. Vincent, the head of the entertainment division, says, &quot;David's international dimension is very important to us.&quot; He adds: &quot;It's hard to get people in Hollywood to focus on how much of our market is outside the U.S.&quot;    Says Mr. Puttnam: &quot;I'm opposed fundamentally to antisocial films which damage the social fabric and to people who make films that stir the pot with hostility.&quot; But he stresses he is concerned with a movie's commercial potential. &quot;I want to shrug off this image that I'm some artsy European who makes art films,&quot; he says.    As is typical in a studio-management changeover, it will take about 18 months for films developed solely by Mr. Puttnam and his team to hit theaters. In the meantime, he has put his stamp on movies that were in the works when he arrived and has picked up projects from other studios, in some cases looking for less expensive stars and hiring directors with whom he has worked in the past. Of some 122 projects in development at Columbia when he arrived, Mr. Puttnam slashed 65 and put 15 or 20 new ones in the works.    He has also replaced key executives with his own team, surprising some by tapping David Picker as his chief operating officer. Over the years, Mr. Picker had held executive posts at various Hollywood studios, but he had been out of the mainstream for several years. Mr. Puttnam also brought in a half-dozen of his own British associates, leading industry pundits to dub the studio &quot;British Columbia.&quot;    But Mr. Puttnam didn't clean house entirely. &quot;He could have come in and fired us all the next day -- it happens,&quot; says Michael Nathanson, an executive vice president. &quot;But we're comfortable with the associates he brought in; and since the day he walked in, he's had an open door.&quot;    Mr. Puttnam says his biggest task at Columbia is to &quot;cut through the atmosphere of negativism that pervaded the place and its movies.&quot; After Columbia's previous chief, Mr. McElwaine, left last May, virtually no new projects were started. And because &quot;Ishtar&quot; ran months over schedule, Columbia had no movie to release during the crucial Christmas box-office season.    One of Mr. Puttnam's first acts at Columbia was to reorganize the studio; that included forming a new unit to act as the liaison between the studio and film makers from the inception of each movie through its release. &quot;I remember what it was like to be on the outside with the frustrations of trying to crack the studio system,&quot; he explains.    Mr. Puttnam insists his cost-cutting measures are already evident. He says the studio's average movie budget this year will be $10.7 million, compared with $14.6 million in 1985. But he isn't abandoning big-budget projects completely if he believes there is a potential hit; one of his first moves was to finalize a deal for Columbia to spend $22 million on a movie starring Bill Cosby. &quot;The budget is completely justified,&quot; says Mr. Puttnam. &quot;That film could really work.&quot;    However, Mr. Puttnam says he is eager to take chances with lesser lights, such as European producers and talented young film makers. He explains: &quot;People here want to do business with big names and have dinner with big names. I want to make films for the rest of the world, with people who are genuinely unknown.&quot;    Among his more controversial actions, Mr. Puttnam says he also plans to eliminate the so-called housekeeping deals that require the studio to pay producers' development and overhead costs. &quot;The big, rich housekeeping deals . . . make no sense for the studio and by the end of 1987 we won't have any,&quot; he says.    But some in Hollywood question the way Mr. Puttnam has handled some of Columbia's successful producers. For example, Martin Ransohoff, who was associated with the studio for 10 years and was the producer of one of its biggest recent hits, &quot;Jagged Edge,&quot; says Mr. Puttnam scrapped his screenplay for &quot;Switching Channels,&quot; a remake of the 1940 Howard Hawks classic &quot;His Girl Friday.&quot; Mr. Ransohoff managed an end run around Mr. Puttnam by getting Nelson Entertainment, a Coke-financed company whose pictures Columbia distributes, to produce the movie.    Mr. Puttnam also declined to make a sequel to &quot;Jagged Edge.&quot; Mr. Ransohoff, for his part, says that after he completes two movies he owes Columbia, &quot;I'm not committed and neither are they.&quot;    But Mr. Puttnam's most provocative move has been to tackle what he calls the industry's inflated salary expectations. He says he recently had &quot;an extraordinary row&quot; with an agent whose clients were a young couple producing their first film. The agent, Mr. Puttnam recalls, &quot;was shocked that we were only offering them $200,000. 'This is Hollywood,' he said to me. Well, stick around. We're prepared to bite the bullet and say no.&quot; With actors, Mr. Puttnam says, he is trying to eliminate big up-front salaries in favor of compensation tied to box-office performance.    He is also rejecting talent-agency packages -- film projects that come attached to certain stars, directors and producers. And he has been willing to substitute players rather than bow to demands. For example, when Dan Aykroyd decided he didn't want to star alongside singer Cyndi Lauper, a first-time actress, in a comedy &quot;Vibes,&quot; the studio cast actor Jeff Goldblum in the role rather than back out on its commitment to Ms. Lauper. Says Columbia's Mr. Picker: &quot;We thought we had the best combination -- if Dan didn't agree, he had the right to withdraw.&quot; Creative Artists, Mr. Aykroyd's agent, didn't return calls seeking comment on this matter.    The studio's handling of Mr. Aykroyd and Mr. Puttnam's recent difficulties with Mr. Murray have led many to speculate that &quot;Ghostbusters 2&quot; will never get made at Columbia. But Mr. Puttnam insists he is doing everything in his power to ensure that it does. Moreover, sequels to big hits like &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; are almost guaranteed box-office successes, and Mr. Picker notes that could help all the parties put aside any differences they have with Mr. Puttnam. &quot;Hopefully, greed will win out in the end,&quot; he says.    Despite Mr. Puttnam's clashes in Hollywood, he is clearly a respected figure in the creative community. Writers and directors say they are pleased to see a real film maker at the head of a studio. Mr. Puttnam, who never attended college and started out in advertising, produced his first film, &quot;Melody,&quot; in 1969 and became a major force in the British film industry during the 1970s.    Roland Joffe, who directed both &quot;The Killing Fields&quot; and &quot;The Mission&quot; for Mr. Puttnam, says, &quot;Studios tend to pick lawyers and accountants -- Coke is appointing a financially acute artist.&quot; He adds that Mr. Puttnam is &quot;full of contradictions -- compassionate and ruthless at the same time, he's got a long memory and he's very loyal. But that psychological skeleton is ideally suited for the job he's in.&quot;    Concludes Mr. Joffe: &quot;David presages something newer {in Hollywood} and that disturbs people who are sitting on very comfortably stuffed cushions and find some of the stuffing gone.&quot;    But Mr. Puttnam's critics say he is making too much noise about Hollywood's foibles before accomplishing anything there himself. And they note that for all his attacks on high-budget films, the cost of &quot;The Mission&quot; increased from about $18 million to nearly $25 million during filming. Recently opened in 700 theaters, &quot;The Mission&quot; has taken in only $12.4 million at the box office so far.    Mr. Puttnam admits that in his new role as studio chief, he would be hard-pressed to approve the budget for &quot;The Mission.&quot; &quot;What I would say to a producer who brought me that project is, 'I really want to make this movie, so come back when you can make it for $15 million.'&quot; He adds, &quot;Maybe no one was willing to take me on.&quot;    Mr. Puttnam hasn't been shy about taking others on, though, and some of that is coming back to haunt him. In 1978, after he quit as producer of &quot;Agatha,&quot; he made unflattering remarks to an interviewer about working with the film's star, Dustin Hoffman. He has recently been repeating those remarks. Mr. Hoffman's lawyer, Mr. Fields, says he is considering mounting a libel suit on Mr. Hoffman's behalf and terms Mr. Puttnam's alleged troubles with Mr. Hoffman &quot;a fabrication.&quot;    Mr. Fields says his other client, Mr. Beatty, remains furious over Mr. Puttnam's attacks on his 1980 film, &quot;Reds,&quot; when that film and Mr. Puttnam's &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; were both up for an Academy Award for best picture. Mr. Fields says disdainfully that Mr. Puttnam will &quot;say anything that gets him headlines and promotes his own films at the expense of someone else's.&quot;    Mr. Puttnam says he stands by everything he has said in the past. &quot;I quite like a fight, and people should know that David Puttnam doesn't just go away,&quot; he says. As for Mr. Beatty's and Mr. Hoffman's film, &quot;Ishtar,&quot; he notes that it is in the studio's best interest to make the movie work, considering its cost.    If &quot;Ishtar&quot; fails, however, it will provide the perfect fodder for Mr. Puttnam's criticisms of highly paid stars and big-budget films. Industry executives calculate that after the stars and others in the film are paid and marketing and distribution costs covered, the movie will have to take in about $150 million at the box office just for the studio to break even -- a sum few films approach.    Mr. Puttnam says his primary concern now is to prove to Coke that Columbia can avoid movies with budgets on the scale of &quot;Ishtar&quot; and still have hits. And he is eager to exploit what he views as &quot;synergy&quot; between the giant soft-drink company and Columbia. For example, Mr. Puttnam has been working with Philippines President Corazon Aquino on a film about her late husband, which could help Coke's ties in that country.    &quot;I really believe Columbia can bring enormous invisible earnings to Coke by our reputation and our ability to be an important international player,&quot; Mr. Puttnam says. &quot;Where do you put that in the bottom line?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
