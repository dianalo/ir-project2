<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-92-0628 </DOCNO><TEXT>The purpose of the event is to improve the accuracy of maintaining thestability of the ratio of the constant component of output voltage tothe amplitude of a high-frequency component in wide range of output voltages.Two additional detectors and a direct voltage source are untroduced tothe unit designated for mass spectrometer analyzer supply. The inputof the first additional detector is connected with the input of the maindetector and its output - with the input of the second additional detectorand with the common point of the main detector. The output of the secondaddititonal detector is connected with one output of the direct voltagesource; its another output is connected with the common bus. The considereddevice provides high relative resolution in wide range of analyzed masseswithout additional tuning. 1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
