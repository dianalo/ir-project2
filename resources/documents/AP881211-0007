The rocket blasted off at 9:34 p.m. (7:34 p.m. EST) from theKourou space center on the Atlantic coast of French Guiana, on thenorthern coast of South America.   About 30 minutes later, it deployed a satellite to broadcast TVdirectly into European homes and another to be used for Britishmilitary communications, according to Arianespace President FredericD'Allest.   In a last-minute hitch before liftoff, an instrument indicated amalfunction of a valve on the third stage of the rocket. Thecountdown stopped with 26 seconds left.   But technicians checked the valve and found it in working order.The countdown resumed after a 30-minute delay, and the launch wenton with no apparent problems.   The countdown was halted Friday night minutes before liftoff whena menacing storm cloud passed. It was later postponed because of afaulty sensor on the rocket's third stage.   The Ariane 4 model of the rocket took off just once before in ademonstration launch last June, when it placed three satellites inorbit. Saturday's launch represents the first commercial mission forthe latest, more powerful and versatile version of the Arianerockets.   Arianespace is a private French-based consortium entrusted withcommercial launches of the Ariane rockets developed by the13-national European Space Agency. The manufacture and assembly ofrocket components are divided among dozens of European companies togive each country benefits proportional to its investment inresearch and development.   The European program has benefited from the troubles of the U.S.space shuttle related to the explosion of the Challenger in 1986.The Ariane program now has 40 satellites on its order book forfuture launches.   The Astra 1A satellite, owned by a Luxembourg-based consortium,is designed to broadcast 16 channels of television programs that canbe received by home dishes as small as two-feet wide.   Eleven of the channels are already sold, and plans are to beginbroadcasts in late January, offering all-news, all-sports,all-movies and other programming available to 85 percent of WestEuropean homes.   Astra officials say they could eventually serve 55 million homesdirectly and 25 million more via master antenna systems.   Australian publisher and station owner Rupert Murdoch's NewsInternational Group is the chief client.   Another Ariane rocket last month launched a French competitor,TDF-1, but it has not yet lined up programming for its six channels.   The other satellite carried by Ariane 4, Britain's Skynet 4B,represents the first of four such satellites which together willprovide a communications network for British navy submarines,surface ships and ground stations.</TEXT></DOC>
