The jump in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators followed atiny 0.1 percent gain in November and a 0.3 percent decline inOctober. It was the largest increase since a similar 0.8 percentadvance last April.   The index, composed of 11 forward-looking statistics designed toforecast economic activity six to nine months into the future, wasthe latest indication that the economy, while weak, can avoid anactual decline in growth.   The December report showed the index up just 0.4 percent for theyear, compared with an increase of 3.9 percent for all of 1988. Itsuggests that economic activity this year could be more sluggishthan in 1989.   Six of the statistics contributed to the December gain, led byan increase in the backlog of manufacturers' unfilled orders.   Others showing strength were an increase in plant and equipmentorders, higher stock prices, a rise in the money supply, anincrease in building permits and a gain in an index measuringconsumer confidence.   The biggest drag on the index last month was a drop in the priceof raw materials. While such a decrease is considered good news forinflation prospects, it is counted as a negative in the indexbecause it also can reflect declining demand.   Other negatives were an increase in weekly unemployment claims,a decline in orders for consumer goods and a speedup in businessdelivery times.   The average work week was unchanged.   The various changes left the index at 145.7 percent of its 1982base of 100. For the year, the index posted increases in sevenmonths: January, April, July, August, September, November andDecember. It declined in February, March, May, June and October.   In advance of the report, some analysts had suggested that thecurrent sluggishness is akin to flirting with a recession.   ``I think that we're very, very close,'' said LawrenceChimerine, senior economic adviser for the WEFA Group in BalaCynwyd, Pa. ``I mean, we're as close to being in a recessionwithout being in one as you can be.''   Nevertheless, Chimerine and other economists found themselvesagreeing with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who toldCongress on Tuesday that, while he ``wouldn't want to bet theranch,'' he thinks the economy will avoid a recession.   Growth through much of 1989 was restrained by high interestrates resulting from the Fed's efforts to slow inflation by keepinga tight rein on credit. Some government officials and economistshave recently urged a looser grip in order to spur growth.   The latest Commerce report on the overall 1989 economy, thegross national product, showed growth slowing from 3 percent in thethird quarter of 1989 to just 0.5 percent in the October-Decemberperiod.   And many analysts foresee continued sluggish growth in much of1990, although some see improvements as the year progresses.   ``Things may be a little better than is widely perceived,''suggested economist Michael Niemira of the Mitsubishi Bank in NewYork. ``I think that things are likely to improve from here onout.''   Greenspan said in his testimony to the Joint Economic Committee:``The imbalances and dislocations as we see in the economy todayprobably do not suggest anything more than a temporary hesitationin the continuing expansion of the economy.''   But Chimerine was not quite so sanguine.   ``We'll probably see positive growth, but just barely,'' he said.   Part of Greenspan's optimism is based on comparing the CommerceDepartment's current leading indicators with the indicators justbefore and during previous recessions.   ``The resulting measure suggests that the probability of arecession developing in the next six months increased last springto almost 30 percent, but according to the most recent estimateshas declined to about 20 percent,'' he said.   Using another index compiled by economists at the NationalBureau of Economic Research, which relies less heavily on data fromthe manufacturing sector and does not include stock prices,Greenspan said there is about a 10 percent chance of a recession.   ``Both probabilities are much smaller than those occurring atthe beginning of each of the four recessions since the late1960s,'' he said.``For example, the probability exceeded 50 percentshortly before each of the previous recessions using the NBERindex.''   Nevertheless, he continued, ``I wouldn't want to bet the ranchon such statistical measures,'' and said the central bank wouldcontinue to watch developments closely.</TEXT></DOC>
