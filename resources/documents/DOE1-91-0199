<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-91-0199 </DOCNO><TEXT>The energy dependence of reflection coefficient of ultra-cold neutronsfrom /sup 113/Cd and /sup 155/Gd strongly absorbing element surface ismeasured. Samples were prepared by the method of thermal evaporationin vacuum directly in neutron beam. The spectra of reflected neutronswere measured with the correlation type of time-of-flight spectrometer.In the /sup 155/Gd case for which real part of the interaction potentialis much lesser than the imaginary part, the effect of ''metallic'' reflectionof neutrons is observed. 12 refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
