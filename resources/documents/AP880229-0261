Fussing over children seems like a national pasttime, but ifpresent trends continue Italians will have fewer and fewer toddlersto dote on.   To the concern of politicians and sociologists, the Italianfamily is steadily shrinking. The latest statistics say each familyhas an average of 1.27 children, the lowest in Europe.   ``Children are still king in Italy. But, these days, one king isenough, not two or three,'' said Renato Tagliani, a father who hasjust one little emperor in his household, 11-year-old,chubby-cheeked Gianbattista.   Family is practically a sacred institution in Italy. It'scertainly the most enduring one in a country that has seen invadersconquer and crumple and governments rise and fall.   ``The value of family as an institution hasn't changed,'' saidLorella Spinelli, a 30-year-old Roman, who had her first child inthe fall. ``But to create a world for children these days is verydifficult.''   Fingers point to the slow but steady changing of women's roles,the difficulty of finding jobs and housing and the irritations ofdaily life that are particularly Italian and particularlyfrustrating if you want to have children.   ``To have more children signifies being penalized, suffering thelack of services, inadequate salaries,'' said demographer AntonioGolini, who directs a national center for population research.   What's especially intriguing is that surveys show the practiceof birth control is low in Italy compared to other Western Europeancountries.   ``Less than 12 percent of women use the pill, more than 60percent don't use any contraceptive,'' said Panorama, an Italiannews weekly, in a recent issue.   ``Are Italians not making love any more? Have they all becomesterile?''   Studies are under way here to see if Italians are indeedbecoming infertile.   For Laura Spinelli, just starting out as a parent, and RenatoTagliani, with more than a decade of experience, the reluctance ofso many Italians to be parents once, let alone more than once,seems understandable.   ``Having children once was the goal of an Italian woman's life.You married, had kids, stayed at home,'' said Mrs. Spinelli.   ``Now the role of women is more like men's. You go to universityand finish when you're 25 or 26. Then it's usually a year or sobefore you find a job. Once you find one, you're reluctant to leaveit to have a child.''   Her husband's success in business allowed her to give up her jobafter childbirth, but he's on the road a lot.   ``I'm lucky to have my mother at home,'' Mrs. Spinelli said.   Her 67-year-old mother helps with the care of grandson Luca.   ``I have a friend whose mother lives on the opposite end of thecity,'' Mrs. Spinelli said. ``She leaves her 7-month-old baby withher mother all week because with all the traffic it would take hertoo long to get there and back.''   Such daily trials mean ``nonna'' (grandmother) is rapidlyreplacing ``mama'' as the anchor of the Italian household.   Nonna is in special demand because babysitters are hard to findand can be expensive.   Many Italians won't let their teen-agers work because they areobsessed with ``brutta figura'' _ making a bad impression _ andneighbors might gossip that your children have to work because youdon't earn enough.   With no grandma handy, the Taglianis, a two-career couple withtheir own business, a media agency, feel the shortage ofbabysitters daily.   ``Italian schools close at 1:30 p.m. So where do you put yourchild when he gets out?'' said Clemenzia Tagliani.   In Italy, stores are closed at lunchtime, in the evening and onSundays and public schools are open Saturday mornings.   ``So if you have to buy a pair of shoes for your son you draghim out of school on Saturday, when you're off, and make a mad dashto the store before they pull down their shutters at 1 p.m.,'' Mrs.Tagliani said.   Miriam Mafai, a journalist who has written extensively onItalian women, finds it curious that an overwhelmingly RomanCatholic country, where the pill was illegal until the early 1970sand where Christian Democrats are the dominant party, doesn't havea policy to make it easier to raise a family.   Some political debate has begun about what to do, but so far nolegislation has been adopted.   Among suggestions are financial incentives, but none soambitious as the family program in neighboring France. Gen. Charlesde Gaulle, after becoming president in 1959, used monthlyallowances to encourage the French to have more children. Theresult is that a French couple with two children today collectsmore than 1,200 francs (about $200) a month from the government.   Ms. Mafai said such ideas invoke the ``stigma'' of BenitoMussolini, Italy's fascist dictator who tried to swell thepopulation for his glory, his army and his dreamed-of imperialcolonies.   ``War is to man what motherhood is to woman,'' Mussolini oncesaid. He introduced family allowances in the 1930s and madebachelors pay a heavy tax. But the birth rate actually fell forseveral years under his rule.   Golini, the demographer, predicts Italy's child population willswell in the next few years, but that will be only a consequence ofthe 1960s economics boom babies reaching child-bearing age.   ``In the first six months of '86, the average number of childrenper family was 1.33; at the end of the year, we went down to 1.32.In '87, in the same period, the average was 1.29; in December,1.27. You see, we're always going down.''   ``But remove the cause and Italy will grow again,'' Golini said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 6</NOTE></DOC>
