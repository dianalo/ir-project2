Suchemissions are blamed for the production of 'acid rain' and for otherenvironmental problems. The oxides of nitrogen are emitted to the atmospherefrom three main sources: automobiles, nitric acid plants, and electricitygenerating power stations and other stationary sources, including engines.The work described will concentrate on: the mechanism of the reactionof NO, NH/sub 3/ and O/sub 2/ over the monolayer catalyst V/sub 2/O/sub5/ on TiO/sub 2/, and the development of silica-supported vanadia/titaniacatalysts for the selective reduction of NO/sub x/ by ammonia in thepresence of an excess of oxygen. The mechanistic work was carried outwith the aid of labelled molecules such as /sup 15/NH/sub 3/, /sup 15/NOand /sup 18/O/sub 2/. The role of O/sub 2/ and NH/sub 3/ is discussedin both a qualitative and a quantitative sense. The results confirm thatlattice oxygen participates in the reaction. Water, produced from thereaction involving NO, NH/sub 3/ and O/sub 2/, is formed at two sites;the first part comes from the reaction of gaseous nitric oxide and adsorbedammonia via an Eley-Rideal mechanism; the other part comes from a surfacedehydration process. Evidence is given that ammonia does not react withoxygen during the reaction, but that nitrogen and nitrous oxide wereproduced by a reaction involving all three species: NO, NH/sub 3/ andO/sub 2/. Nitrous oxide and water are both formed at different sitesof the catalyst. Finally, the preparation and characterization of alternativecatalysts are described. Vanadia on silica and vanadia/titania on silicacatalysts were prepared by homogeneous deposition precipitation; theyare characterized by carbon monoxide oxidation and other conventionalmethods. 45 figs., 149 refs., 24 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
