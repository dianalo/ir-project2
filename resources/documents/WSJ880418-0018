To be sure, a low-income worker pays more of his income into the fund than does his more fortunate colleague. But what about benefits?    Being near retirement age, I recently attended pre-retirement seminars conducted by my employer. Social Security was one of the topics covered. Work sheets demonstrating computations of benefits were passed out. According to these sheets, benefits are based on something called Average Indexed Monthly Earnings (AIME) collected over the lifetime of the wage earner. AIME represents the inflation-adjusted income on which FICA taxes were paid. In the examples given, a worker with AIME of $310 a month would receive 90% of that amount in benefits. A worker with AIME of $1,821 a month would receive about 42% of that amount in benefits, while AIME of $2,205 would entitle the worker to 38% of his AIME in benefits.    In any rational analysis, this scheme must be called progressive to the point of being embarrassing. In the interest of objectivity, therefore, perhaps Mr. Murray and others who write about Social Security will in the future cover both sides of the picture: taxes and benefits.    Leon O.
