The administration plan, called &quot;Mission to Planet Earth,&quot;envisions launching two $3 billion satellites near the end ofthe decade to study the changing global environment. Each ofthe satellites, called the Earth Observing System, or EOS,would be replaced every five years to get a 15-yearenvironmental record of Earth.</LP><TEXT>   But EOS critics, who include some of the leading climateresearchers, say the satellites are too expensive, toocomplex and too risky. If an EOS satellite should fail duringlaunch or operation, they say, it could devastate climateresearch because so many instruments are concentrated on asingle platform.   The academy report gave fresh ammunition to the critics.James Baker, an oceanographer who was chairman of the panel,said the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shouldlaunch small satellites in addition to EOS -- even if itmeans taking money from the EOS budget and delaying EOSlaunches. These smaller satellites are needed to continuecurrent observations of the Earth or to add capabilitiesmissing in EOS, he said.   &quot;We can't wait for EOS&quot; to get those measurements, saidMr. Baker.   NASA, in a nod to its critics, so far has backed foursmall satellites to study atmospheric ozone, ocean plantlife, sea winds and tropical rainfall before the EOSlaunches. Mr. Baker said NASA's top priority should be tomake sure those satellites, called Earth Probes, arelaunched. Then the agency should examine adding satellites tomeasure the Earth's magnetic field, gravity field, cloudcoverage and soil moisture, he said.   For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, NASA has requested$235 million for the EOS program and $25 million for thesmaller satellites. Mr. Baker said NASA should considershifting money from EOS to the Earth Probes to advance thelaunch dates of the smaller satellites.   NASA officials oppose shifting money from EOS, and say thehuge satellites are their first priority.   The EOS satellites will pass the same points on Earth atthe same time every day, measuring the interplay of theatmosphere, land and ocean. Getting simultaneous readings ofdifferent climatic data would be a big advance, NASA says,because it would give researchers a way to understand theclimate as a whole.   The academy report said it made sense to package the firstEOS, which measures the interaction of the Earth surface andatmosphere, as a single big satellite. But it said the workof the second EOS could be divided into smaller satellites.The orbits of smaller satellites can be geared to getting thebest data from the few instruments that each carried onboard, the report said. The EOS must pick a compromise orbitto satisfy the dozen or so instruments that must worktogether.   The 14-member panel consisted mainly of atmospheric andspace scientists who work at universities.</TEXT></DOC>
