I was born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island. I worked at Chase Manhattan for three years, and took the opportunity to move to Rapid City, S.D., several years ago. I was asked to transfer to Spearfish.    When I made the decision to leave New York, I wanted to breathe clean air, air that I could not see. It now takes me two minutes to get to work vs. one hour each way. People are friendly, the crime rate is low, and it is a fantastic place to raise children. I make a good living in a very comfortable, clean environment.    This is a great place to live. Please don't tell too many people as one New Yorker in Spearfish is plenty.    Myles Kennedy   President, Northwest Bank S.D.   Spearfish, S.D.   ---   Your Dec. 15 feature on failures should be required reading for every person bitten by the &quot;entrepreneurial bug.&quot; As a small-business owner for 13 years I have learned through experience that the amount of gross profit a company can support is determined more by the economy of its industry than by its management. Each new business enterprise simply dilutes the available dollars and drives down prices. We don't need more entrepreneurs in our struggling economy.    I belong to the American Society to Stifle the Entrepreneurial Syndrome (acronym censored), which has a membership of one. Who will make it two!?    Marylou H. Paine   Ashland, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
