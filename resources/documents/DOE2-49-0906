However, drillingmud-base oils have predominantly and in the present case, almost exclusivelysaturated components. Studies on the fate and effects of petroleum oilin fish have concentrated on the aromatics. A recent investigation ofthe mutagenicity vs toxicity of the various water soluble fractions ofKuwait crude oil suggests that much of the toxicity of that fractionatedoil is due to alkanes, alkenes, aliphatics and one-ring cyclic compounds.Aliphatic molecules such as dodecane and docosane have been shown tobioaccumulate in fish with a bioaccumulation factor of 50 and 10, whichis close to that found for aromatic molecules. In view of all these observationsand since {sup 13}C NMR analysis of the metabolites found in the gallbladder bile of cunners exposed to No. 2 fuel oil indicated the presenceof an aliphatic moiety in the bile mixture, it was deemed of interestto determine if the gall bladder bile would act as a bioconcentratorof an oil quasi-free of aromatics.</TEXT></DOC>
