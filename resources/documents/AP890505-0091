In a huge 12.5 percent swing against the government, thesocialist Labor Party captured the Vale of Glamorgan, a largelyrural Welsh district, with a 6,028-vote majority. That overturnedthe Conservatives' 6,251-vote majority in 1987 general elections.   ``This is what the new modern Labor Party can do ... Mrs.Thatcher's days are numbered,'' declared victor John Smith, who wona House of Commons seat left vacant by the death of a lawmaker.   Defeated Conservative Rod Richards acknowledged votes were lostover Mrs. Thatcher's plans to overhaul property taxes and theNational Health Service, and to sell off the national water andelectricity utilities.   ``We have to win that debate in the country and it will taketime because we're changing something quite radically and peopleare naturally concerned as to how it will affect them,'' he said.   Smith retorted: ``My Conservative opponent had to defend theindefensible. This was a test of Mrs. Thatcher's 10 years in officeand the people of the Vale of Glamorgan made it absolutely clearthat she's not wanted.''   Health Secretary Kenneth Clarke dismissed the result as a minormidterm setback.   Labor also scored heavily off the two divided center parties,whose support collapsed.   Smith polled 23,342 votes to the Tories' 17,314. The centristSocial and Liberal Democratic Party took only 2,017 and the SocialDemocractic Party, its previous electoral ally, got 1,098. TheWelsh nationalist party Plaid Cymru also did badly with 1,672 votes.   The election of the 38-year-old business studies lecturer shavedMrs. Thatcher's majority in the 650-member House of Commons to 101_ still ample to assure passage of her ambitious reforms.   The Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 228, the Social andLiberal Democrats 19 and the Social Democratic Party 3. Minorityregional parties hold the rest.   It is only the fourth time in 25 years that Labor has snatched aseat from the Conservatives in a by-election.   The centrist parties acknowledged they paid heavily for theirsplit after the last general election in 1987, and the rivalriesthat have become known as ``the muddle in the middle.''   Mrs. Thatcher, who celebrated her 10th anniversary by declaringshe had transformed Britain, faced more problems on the industrialfront.   She swept to power on a wave of anti-union sentiment May 4,1979, after a winter of strikes in which garbage piled up acrossthe country, hospitals turned away the sick and the dead were leftunburied.   But now, strikes over pay or conditions loom on the staterailroad, in the docks, the engineering industry, the electricitysupply service, the fire-fighting service, the London subway andamong news staff at the British Broadcasting Corp.   London's liberal newspaper The Guardian predicted today Britainis heading for its worst industrial strife since a yearlong coalminers' strike collapsed in 1985.   Some Conservative legislators claim the unrest may be anorganized campaign. ``This is beginning to look like aconspiracy,'' said Tory legislator Harry Greenway.   The Institute of Directors, an employers' organization,meanwhile reported that confidence in the British economy amongcompany directors has fallen the last two months. It said thoselisted as ``more optimistic'' dropped from 29 percent to 19percent, while more than half said they were ``less optimistic.''</TEXT></DOC>
