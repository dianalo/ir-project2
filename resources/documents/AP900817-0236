SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Amoco Corp. and Unocal Corp. began raisingwholesale gasoline prices as promised Friday, citing competitivepressures.   Atlantic Richfield Co. said it would continue its price freezedespite a surge in demand that caused pumps to run dry briefly atabout 270 stations as buyers lined up for its lower-priced fuel.   President Bush appealed for voluntary price restraints last weekafter Iraq invaded oil-rich Kuwait.   Chicago-based Amoco and Los Angeles-based Unocal were among thecompanies that froze gas prices to dealers for a week. Theyannounced Thursday the freeze would end, blaming competitivepressures. No Arco-style shortages were reported by either company,however.   On Friday, Unocal said it had raised prices by a penny a gallonin San Diego and San Jose, Calif.; Seattle; Portland and Eugene,Ore.; Las Vegas and Reno, Nev.; and Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz.   Amoco, which sells gas in 30 states, said it raised prices todealers by 1 cent per gallon in the St. Louis market; by 2 centsper gallon in Indianapolis, Milwaukee, Detroit and Minneapolis; and2{ cents per gallon in Kansas City and Denver.   ``Amoco's refineries are currently using crude oil received andpriced since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and this gasoline priceincrease partially reflects the higher price of that oil,'' RobertJ. Rauscher, Amoco marketing vice president, said in a statement.   The increases do not directly affect retail gas prices becausefederal law requires those to be set independently, but theygenerally are passed along to consumers.   Los Angeles-based Arco has access to ample Alaska oil, whichhistorically has helped it maintain a low-price marketing strategythat includes all self-service stations. It has kept its freeze ineffect, although it said it was reviewing the situation daily. Itsells gasoline at 1,500 stations in five Western states.   An Aug. 10 Lundberg Survey of pump prices found Arco prices 4cents to 12 cents per gallon cheaper than competitors in the LosAngeles area. That kind of price disparity has caused sales volumeto surge by 9 percent since Arco announced its freeze on Aug. 8,spokesman Doug Elmets said.   That heavy demand coincided with a fire Monday that cutproduction of gasoline by 15,000 barrels per day at Arco's refineryin suburban Carson. That and heavy business at gas stations caused``sold out'' signs to go up at regular unleaded pumps at the 270stations, Elmets said.   Nearly all the stations were in Southern California and thePhoenix and Las Vegas areas. Elmets said it's taken an average of2{ hours to replenish regular unleaded gas at the stations.   He said to ensure an adequate supply to dealers, Arco had takenthe unusual step of purchasing 100,000 barrels of gasoline on thespot market Wednesday for $1 per gallon, or $4.2 million.   ``We've hired every common carrier we can find to get gas to ourstations,'' Elmets said. ``We are going to continue to hold theline as long as we can.''   A Unocal spokesman, Barry Lane, said Unocal preferred not topursue such a strategy.   ``We certainly don't want to get caught into a shortagesituation by being too far below the market,'' he said, adding:``We don't want to be too far above, either.''</TEXT></DOC>
