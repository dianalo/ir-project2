Hills said she was optimistic that the administration's decisionwould result in successful negotiations despite howls of protestfrom the targeted countries.   The administration, implementing the most controversial sectionof the 1988 trade law, cited the three nations last month forserious fair-trade violations with the threat that they could face100 percent retaliatory tariffs if the countries do not agree toremove the offending barriers to U.S. products.   The United States action was criticized at an internationalmeeting last week in Paris, with the 24-nation Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development attacking such unilateral tradeactions.   Hills, who attended the Paris meeting, defended theadministration against complaints from other countries that theUnited States was threatening to set off a global trade war ofretaliation and counter-retaliation.   In testimony Thursday before the House Ways and Meanssubcommittee on trade, Hills said, ``We do not seek mindlessname-calling'' in implementing the trade law.   Rather, she said, the administation hoped that it had laid outthe priorities it would be working to achieve in opening marketsover the next year.   Hills received general praise from members of the tradesubcommittee for her decision.   Subcommittee Chairman Sam Gibbons, D-Fla., said that theadministration had managed to walk a fine line between sounding``tough enough to say we mean business but also saying we are hereto negotiate.''   Some congressmen questioned why the administration had chosensuch a limited target list. For Japan, the products covered by thenegotiations will be supercomputers, satellites and U.S. lumber.   Hills said the countries and items named represented a judgmentcall on the part of the administration of the areas which offeredthe best possibility of expanding markets for American productswithin the tight negotiating deadlines set by the trade provision,called ``Super 301.''   Countries not named to the priority list this year could still benamed when the administration is required to present a new list nextyear, Hills said.   Shortly after Hills' appearance, a U.S. shipbuilding industrygroup announced that it had filed a complaint challenging shipyardsubsidies provided by the governments of West Germany, Norway, Japanand South Korea.   The petition, filed by the Shipbuilders Council of America, anindustry trade group, requested that Hills begin negotiations to endthe subsidies being provided by the four countries.   The shipbuilding group unveiled its demands during a Capitol Hillnews conference attended by several senators and House members whorepresent cities with shipyards with many of them complaining aboutthe closing of 55 shipyards since 1978 with a loss of 60,000 jobs.   Hills has 45 days to decide whether to accept the petition andbegin negotiations with the countries to end the subsidies.   During her testimony, Hills announced that the United States andJapan would begin talks next week on a broad range of Japanese``structural'' impediments to trade. She said she hoped theseinitial discussions would lay the groundwork for talks aimed atremoving various broad-based impediments to trade such as theJapanese distribution system.</TEXT></DOC>
