 Many feel that fiberoptic cable is simply overkill.andP;  They feel that a 16M-bps TokenRing is fast, and that a 100M-bps fiber system would be wasted.andO;Many of those who are choosing to install fiber are using it toconnect wide area networks, or as backbones for copper networks.andO;Proponents of fiber optic cable point out its resistance toelectrical interference and its tight security features.andP;  Becausethe expense of fiber comes from the electronics, not theinstallation, many firms are installing both copper and fibercables, waiting for the day when fiber will be both necessary andcost effective.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber OpticsOptical CommunicationsMarket AnalysisHardware SelectionFiber Distributed Data Interface StandardCablesCommunications Equipment.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Fibre optic cable's roll out slow in developingandM;C'mon now.andP;  Who really NEEDS the mind-boggling 100 megabits per secondtransmission capacity of fibre optic cabling for current local- or evenwide-area networks applications?andM;&quot;There's a saying,&quot; notes consultant Ian Angus, president of Toronto-basedAngus Telemanagement Group Inc.andP;  &quot;'Data grows to fill the bandwidthavailable.'andP;  Now that we have that capacity, we're going to need it.&quot;andM;That's one answer.andP;  But another is that very, very few will need 100MBcapacity.andM;Jane Witherspoon, a LAN product manager at IBM Canada Ltd., says the vastmajority of her customers running 4 MB Token Ring LANs are only running at 60or 70 per cent of capacity -- even where the LAN (local-area network) issupporting image-based applications which involve fairly hefty filetransfers.andP;  And they can still quadruple capacity without going to fibre byinstalling a 16 MB Token Ring.andM;Still, many users -- how many is hard to gauge -- have already installedfibre as building backbones to link copper-based networks on each floor, orto link buildings in a campus.andP;  In other words, awareness of fibre is veryhigh.andM;&quot;I don't know of a single major re-cabling project right now where they'renot at least considering fibre fror backbone networks within a building, orin a campus situation,&quot; says Pasquale DiPierro, president of CorpNetTechnology Inc., a Montreal-based network integrator.andP;  We may not need itnow, the reasoning goes, but we'll need it soon enough.andM;Not that there aren't some applications requiring frequent transfer of largegraphics-based files between powerful workstations that can use the highbandwidth that fibre offers right now.andP;  In a study of technical workstationusers conducted by IDC Canada earlier this year, a dozen out of 250 companiessurveyed were already using fibre in backbone networks.andP;  And 40 more expectedto be using fibre within two years.andM;There are even engineering applications where running fibre to the desktopmakes sense.andP;  In any environment in which there is the threat of electricalinterference, fibre offers a clear advantage over copper.andP;  And because fibreis virtually impossible to tap, it is already being used extensively inapplications where security is an important issue -- especially ingovernment.andM;There seems little doubt, in fact, that fibre is the way of the future forboth local- and wide-area networking.andP;  But where and when to start using it-- and what kind of cable to use -- are still bones of contention among manyusers, vendors and consultants.andM;Ontario Hydro is one company that has already made a major commitment tofibre.andP;  The provincial power company has widespread operations with heavycommunications requirements.andP;  And it has the rights of way to run its ownfibre cables between buildings and campuses in metropolitan areas -- which ithas done.andM;But, like several universities and large corporations, Hydro is also usingfibre for backbone networks within campuses.andP;  It recently installed abackbone network at its Toronto Kipling Ave. campus using FDDI--fibredistributed data interface -- technology.andP;  FDDI is the ANSI-developedstandard for 100MB networks, developed from the IEEE Token Ring LAN standard.andO;It is also possible to implement conventional Ethernet and Token Ringnetworks on fibre, but FDDI offers some extras.andM;For one thing, it provides for bridges between fibre backbones andconventional Ethernet and IBM Token Ring networks running on co-axial cableor twisted pair (telephone) wiring.andP;  Several vendors now have Token Ring -and Ethernet-FDDI interface products on the market.andP;  Digital Equipment Corp.,andO;for example, announced a suite of FDDI products earlier this summer.andO;Ungerman-Bass, the networking company, has had products for over a year.andM;The Ontario Hydro Kipling network links 13 buildings, each with its ownEthernet LAN, some with sub-networks -- about 2,000 attached devices intotal, says Rick Payne, supervising information analyst.andM;Although an FDDI network is logically a ring topology, the Hydro network isphysically an active star configuration.andP;  The longest spoke is close to threekilometers.andP;  Given those distance requirements, the only remotely plausiblealternative to fibre was a broadband cabling system.andP;  Ethernet LANs aregenerally limited to 500-metre runs.andM;In fact, three years ago Hydro installed a similar backbone network linkingits downtown buildings using broadband.andP;  &quot;I suspect if we started on that onenow,&quot; says Payne, &quot;it would be FDDI as well.andP;  But three years ago the FDDIproducts weren't available.&quot;andM;Broadband loses out for two reasons.andP;  It's a thicker cable than themulti-mode fibre used in FDDI networks -- unwieldy at about three quarters ofan inch -- and would have been harder to pull in the Kipling campusenvironment.andM;Not that fibre doesn't pose its own installation problems.andP;  Angus says heknows of some fibre installations where delicate fibre strands were brokenwhen mishandled by installers accustomed to working with copper.andP;  &quot;You haveto get someone who knows what they're doing,&quot; agrees Payne.andM;But the main reason Hydro went with fibre, Payne says, was &quot;the anticipatedtraffic on the network.andP;  We knew we'd eventually need the 100MB.&quot;andM;Hydro, with its metropolitan-area voice-data networks running on privatefibre lines, is clearly an exceptional case, though.andP;  It's on the leadingedge.andP;  And despite the optimism of proponents like CorpNet's DiPierro, it'sstill unclear how the rest of the world will take to data networking overfibre.andM;One obvious factor -- for now at least -- is cost.andM;While the cost of installing fibre cable is not very much more thaninstalling copper, the cost of the electronics -- intelligent node andterminal connections and LAN bridges -- is an order of magnitude more.andP;  Atypical Ethernet connection costs between $300 and $500, Angus says.andP;  An FDDIconnection currently costs between $3,000 and $5,000.andM;One strategy for companies that anticipate a need for fibre in the nearfuture -- but who are renovating or building right now -- is to install fibrealongside copper and use the copper until application requirements justifythe higher cost of fibre electronics.andP;  Or install hybrid fibre and coppercable.andM;Still another possibility is 'blown fibre', an intriguing technologydeveloped in the U.K.andP;  by British Telecom.andP;  Install a plastic tube now whileyou've got the walls ripped out.andP;  Then when the time comes to start usingfibre, blow the fibre strand through the plastic tube.andP;  British Telecom haskits for installing blown fibre.andM;&quot;It's a way of staging the cost of the cable installation,&quot; notes Angus.andO;Another advantage is that you can use lower quality cable inside the plasticsheath.andM;Unfortunately, Mitel Corp., British Telecom's Canadian subsidiary, hasdecided not to actively market blown fibre in Canada -- a sign, perhaps, thatthe fibre market is no quite as robust as some vendors would like to think.andM;DiPierro argues that fibre's high bandwidth and greater distance capabilitiesare not the only factors that will drive demand.andP;  And in some applicationscost may not be as serious a deterrent as it seems, he says.andM;Many companies, DiPierro adds, ar beginning to realize the advantages ofactive hub networks versus traditional passive networks.andP;  Active hubs providenetwork management capabilities that passive networks cannot.andP;  They canmeasure traffic at each workstation.andP;  And they allow for remote disabling andenabling of network nodes.andM;Because of the more sophisticated electronics required to implement activehub networks, the difference in price between an active network on copper andan active network on fibre is significantly less than the difference betweenfibre and copper on passive networks.andM;FFDI will be another market driver, he says.andP;  The FDDI technology offers away of linking together different kinds of LANs--so far Token Ring andEthernet, but with others, including synchronous communications, to be added.andO;This is an important capability for companies that have seen departmentalLANs grow like topsy without any corporate standards influencing theirselection.andP;  FDDI is a way of integrating all those LANs into one enterprisenetwork.andM;But the FDDI standard is still evolving.andP;  And one important players has sofar withheld whole-hearted support.andP;  Although it has prototypes of FDDInetwork cards and bridges in Randamp;D labs, IBM has yet to announce any FDDIproducts--other than the implied promise of a network card for the RISC 6000technical workstation by the end of 1991.andM;There are two reasons for this, says Witherspoon.andP;  First, the FDDI standarddoes not yet specify network management functionality.andP;  The ANSI committee isworking on defining those functions.andP;  In the meantime, FDDI vendors do offersome network management, but it won't necessarily be compliant with the ANSIstandard.andP;  IBM doesn't want to be in the position of introducing FDDIproducts that have to be modified later to make them ANSI compliant.andM;&quot;A company like IBM does not like to have a product out there and then haveto bring it back to rework it,&quot; says Witherspoon.andM;The other reason, she says, is that IBM is not sure the multi-mode LED (lightemitting diode) technology on which the current FDDI standards are based isthe right long-term choice.andP;  The laser-driven single mode fibre technologyallows longer cable runs than multi-mode.andP;  And it's compatible with telephonecompany fibre technology.andP;  A single mode implementation of FDDI mayeventually be included in the standard.andP;  There is a fairly large pricedifference between the two technologies now, but that gap will close,Witherspoon says.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
