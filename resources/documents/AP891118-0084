Keating Jr. who lent his helicopter to her tovisit remote Indian reservations in the Southwest.   Now this former Olympic swimmer and fighter pilot _ a benefactorof charities and politicians, a battler of pornographers andbureaucrats _ is the lead character in the costliest savings andloan failure in the nation's history and a Capitol Hill dramathreatening the political lives of five senators.   Whether bestowing his largess on church, charities, civiccauses, business associates or politicians whose help he might wantsome day, ``Charlie Keating'' has always done it with a touch offlash.   Typifying his desire for the spotlight, Keating insisted onbeing the final witness in the final episode of six weeks of HouseBanking Committee hearings into the growth and collapse of hisLincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.   He got his wish and is scheduled to testify Tuesday.   Originally orchestrated as a forum for building a case to oustM. Danny Wall as the nation's top thrift regulator, the hearingsinstead have evolved into a near inquisition for the senators, towhom Keating and his associates gave $1.3 million in his highlypublic war with Lincoln's regulators.   Although he was formally subpoenaed by the committee, Keating'sassociates say he welcomes an opportunity to tell his side of theLincoln story: that it was regulators who created the Sandamp;Lnightmare, not him.   But just how forthcoming the Phoenix millionaire will be beforecongressional inquisitors was unclear as of late last week. Thetarget of a criminal grand jury in Los Angeles, variousracketeering and fraud suits and ongoing investigations by threefederal agencies, Keating is being advised by some to keep hissilence.   For Keating, that's a tall order. From his initial entry ontothe public stage as an anti-smut crusader, he has been anything butsilent.   When the Home Loan Bank Board seized Lincoln last April _ twoyears after the federal agency's examiners recommended _ Keatingbluntly asserted to reporters the purpose of his largesse toelected officeholders.   ``One question, among the many raised in recent weeks, had to dowith whether my financial support in any way influenced severalpolitical figures to take up my cause,'' he said. ``I want to sayin the most forceful way I can: I certainly hope so.''   Four of five Keating says he meant to influence _ John Glenn,D-Ohio; Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Donald Riegle, D-Mich.; and DennisDeConcini, D-Ariz. _ have told the Senate Ethics Committee informal responses that they did no wrong. The fifth, John McCain,R-Ariz., will submit his response to the formal committee inquirybefore Congress adjourns for Thanksgiving, according to a spokesman.   But regulators have told the House panel they never had seensuch bold political interference as Keating engineered.   ``We've never experienced a guy who had so much juice,'' saidWilliam Crawford, California's savings and loan commissioner.   Altogether, regulators expect Lincoln's failure will costtaxpayers up to $2 billion. They contend in a suit against Keatingthat the losses stemmed from fraud, insider abuse and racketeering.   ``If our recommendations had been followed, the taxpayers wouldhave suffered dramatically smaller losses,'' said William Black,one of the four Bank Board officials summoned to meet with the fivesenators.   Born into a prominent Cincinnati family with strong Republicanconnections, Keating, now 65, began a three-decade-long crusadeagainst pornography in the late 1950s.   In 1970, he won an appointment from President Nixon to theFederal Commission on Obscenity and Pornography as a self-described``book burner.'' He promptly sued the commission to blockpublication of its report until he could write a dissent to itsconclusion that pornography posed no threat.   A lawyer by training, Keating turns to suits frequently inwaging his campaigns. He's filed several against the governmentsince buying Lincoln for $51 million in 1984 and converting it froma traditional home mortgage lender into what critics say was theepitome of the kind of highflier thrifts that were at the root ofindustry problems that required a $157 billion taxpayer bailout.   Other tactics include hiring away at large salaries the stateand federal regulators and private auditors charged with overseeinghis empire on behalf of the public.   The Phoenix managing partner of Lincoln's auditor, the Big Eightaccounting firm of Arthur Young andamp; Co., helped set up the meetingsbetween the regulators and the senators with a report affirmingLincoln's soundness. A year later, he joined Keating's payroll withan annual salary of $950,000.   Glenn, who accepted $200,000 in campaign donations from Keating,recalled feeling ``livid'' when he learned that.   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said. ``Absolutely I felt I wasled down the primrose path.'' Nonetheless, Glenn said he has nointention of returning the $200,000 contribution.   Those Keating didn't hire, he retained, such as Alan Greenspan,formerly the president's chief economic adviser and now chairman ofthe Federal Reserve Board. Then working as a private consultant,Greenspan wrote a study in 1986 defending Keating's practices.   Keating's business instincts and proclivity to spend whatever isnecessary to get what he wants were developed at the knee of CarlH. Lindner, a reclusive Cincinnati billionaire who throughtakeovers built American Financial Corp. into a banking, insurance,real estate and meatpacking empire.   It was as a vice president and director there that Keating hadhis first run-in with financial regulators. After a three-yearinvestigation, the SEC accused the two of fraudulently divertingcompany assets for their personal use.   They eventually signed a consent decree in 1979 admitting nowrong but promising never to do it again. Keating later saidsigning the decree was a mistake, claiming it cost him anappointment from President Reagan to be U.S. ambassador to theBahamas.   About the time the SEC was launching its first investigation ofKeating, he moved to Phoenix to head Continental Homes Inc., atroubled home-building subsidiary of American Financial.   Two years later, in 1978, Keating bought out Continental Homesand changed its name to American Continental Corp. and began dolingout large contributions to candidates for every office from citycouncil to the presidency.   In 1980 he was the West Coast finance chairman in now-bankruptformer Texas Gov. John B. Connally's short-lived campaign for theRepublican presidential nomination.   There he met Lee Henkel Jr., an Atlanta tax lawyer and formerchief counsel at the IRS during part of the Nixon administration,who was carrying out the same task for Connally on the East Coast.   Six years later when Home Loan Bank Board Chairman Edwin Grayand his staff began reigning in the way some thrifts wereoperating, Keating helped win Reagan's appointment of Henkel to thebank board.   Henkel resigned from the board four months later after it wasdisclosed he had loans or shared in partnerships with loans fromLincoln totaling $60 million. But first he proposed changing theboard's regulations to exempt much of Lincoln's investments fromthe newly imposed restrictions. The changes were rejected by theboard's other members.   ``I have taken every action appropriate to rectify theunwarranted bureaucratic assault ... waged against me and mycompany,'' Keating said last April. ``In the contract between thevoter and the politician, we have the right to seek their help whenneeded and demand it when justified. This I have done.''</TEXT></DOC>
