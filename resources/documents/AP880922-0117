Bush said. ``They're wrong.''   The vice president, flanked at a restaurant by about three-dozenmembers of the Boston Police Patrolman's Association, accepted theendorsement voted the day before by the 1,500-member union.   His motorcade was met outside by several hundred pro-Dukakisdemonstrators chanting ``Bush go home'' and ``Where was George?''   Inside Bush's supporters had their own chants of ``We wantBush'' and ``Dump the Duke.'' And one Dukakis backer who _ whenBush began talking about war on crime _ shouted ``War on Noriega,''was ejected from the room by police officers.   In brief remarks, Bush said, ``I'm here not only to accept thisendorsement but to make it clear I'm the one in this race who wantsto strengthen law enforcement.''   ``My opponent is strongly out of the American mainstream onissues such as fighting crime,'' the vice president said. ``Yourendorsement is more than an endorsement of me; it's an endorsementof a philosophy. This is an enormous boost for me.''   Robert T. Guiney, president of the association, said, ``Aspolice officers in the capital city of Massachusetts, we know Gov.Dukakis well and we can state publicly he is no friend of police.''   The vice president, who is limiting public appearances this weekto prepare for Sunday's presidential debate, spent Wednesday inbriefings with advisers and engaged in a mock debate.   While aides are working out final logistical details on theSunday debate, Bush was taking a break from his preparations todayfor the trip to Boston and an appearance with President Reagan inHouston.   The Boston visit is the second this month for Bush. Hepreviously toured Boston Harbor and claimed the Democratic nomineedid little to clean up the heavy pollution in the harbor.   Police union officials, citing Dukakis' opposition to the deathpenalty and his support for a former program granting weekendfurloughs for convicted felons, said they supported Bush because hewould be more attentive to law enforcement needs.   They also said they were angry the governor had failed to attendthe funerals recently of three police officers killed on duty.   ``The police officers in this city are upset with the governorand his policies,'' said Guiney. ``There's a feeling we are takenfor granted.''   Republican leaders were elated and Bush telephoned his thanks toseveral of the union officers.   ``This sends a message to the whole country that the lawenforcement agency that knows Dukakis best doesn't want him tobecome president,'' said Alexander Tennant, executive director ofthe state Republican Party.   Dukakis downplayed the endorsement, citing the association's``history of supporting Republicans,'' including Reagan in 1980 and1984.   Dukakis said he has received backing from other law enforcementorganizations, including the Massachusetts Police Association, theInternational Brotherhood of Police Officers and the Combined LawEnforcement Associations of Texas _ Bush's home state.</TEXT></DOC>
