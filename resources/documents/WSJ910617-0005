Henri Martre, chairman of state-owned Aerospatiale, saidthat his military orders have suffered partly because offallout from the Persian Gulf War and partly because of theoverall world trend away from military spending.</LP><TEXT>   Speaking in an interview before the opening of the ParisAir Show, which began Thursday, Mr. Martre said civilian airtraffic is returning to normal after the war. He said hehopes this will mean renewed growth in civilian aircraftorders, which in turn should push Aerospatiale's overallsales more and more toward civilian business. Aerospatiale isa member of Europe's Airbus consortium and also producessmaller airliners, helicopters, missiles and space launchingequipment.   For years, Aerospatiale has been a leading advocate ofcooperation among European defense companies, and Mr. Martresaid he expects weak markets will provoke more and more sucharrangements. But he and other French executives of weaponsmakers, such as Chairman Alain Gomez of electronics giantThomson S.A., note that cross-border mergers and acquisitionsin the arms business have proved much harder to realize thanonce was expected. Mr. Martre said he hopes now to see growthin cooperative development projects, including morecooperation between U.S. and European arms makers.   &quot;One program we need to do together is the next militarytransport plane,&quot; to replace Lockheed Corp.'s Hercules andthe Franco-German Transall, he said. World-wide needs forsuch planes probably don't justify more than one program, hesaid, adding, &quot;We are totally eager to join in projects ofthat sort.&quot;   Another area for possible trans-Atlantic cooperation, hesaid, is anti-ballistic missiles, notably for defense againstmedium-range missiles. But he said that program is fartheroff than the transport plane.   In the realm of domestic mergers, French governmentofficials have sometimes talked of attaching ailing DassaultAviation to Aerospatiale. Dassault, which also isstate-controlled, makes jet fighters, which Aerospatialedoesn't make.   Mr. Martre supports a Dassault-Aerospatiels linkup. Healso has evoked a possible three-way missile alliance amongAerospatiale, Daimler-Benz AG's Deutsche Aerospace unit andFrance's Matra S.A. Aerospatiale is involved in cooperativeprograms with both Matra and Dassault. But Mr. Martre saysthe idea of closer capital ties is &quot;still at square one,&quot;failing to develop because both Dassault and Matra seemdetermined to remain independent.   At the same time, Mr. Martre last week told a Frenchreporter that he now is talking to Thomson's Mr. Gomez aboutmissile cooperation. That follows the failure of Mr. Gomez'sown plan to unite his missile operations with those ofBritish Aerospace PLC.   On the subject of military sales, Mr. Martre saidAerospatiale has suffered this year. &quot;The effect of the GulfWar on us has been very negative,&quot; he said.   He had to set aside several hundred million francs inprovisions in his 1990 accounts to cover expected losses onunpaid Iraqi debts. Aerospatiale sold Iraq items such asmissiles and helicopters, and almost none of the contractswas covered by French government export insurance. &quot;We areamong the companies most affected&quot; by Iraq's inability to payits debts, Mr. Martre said.   Moreover, Aerospatiale has lost hoped-for orders at othercountries in that region, which Mr. Martre estimates at&quot;several billion francs.&quot;   Even before the war, Aerospatiale hadn't hoped for manymore sales to financially strapped Iraq. But Mr. Martre saysthat since the war, countries such as Saudi Arabia haveturned almost exclusively to the U.S. for their hardwareneeds. In some cases, he says, they have changed theirprocurement plans and focused on U.S. equipment that they sawperforming in the war. Middle East business recently made uponly around 5% to 6% of Aerospatiale's sales, but thatbusiness today is suffering.   &quot;Since the war we have had almost no orders&quot; from thatregion, Mr. Martre said. &quot;The main orders have gone to theU.S. -- maybe in part to buy equipment left behind.&quot;   Mr. Martre says that as Western military budgets arereined in, aerospace goods should suffer less than someland-based munitions. And he thinks that the Gulf War maypersuade governments to spend more on weapons than they mightotherwise have done. Still, he says, budget-cutting meansthat &quot;our military sales will stagnate or perhaps growslightly&quot; over the next five or 10 years. &quot;The most likelytrend is zero growth.&quot;   Civilian sales first surpassed military sales atAerospatiale in 1988. Last year, civilian business --essentially helicopters and airplanes -- grew to 55% of allsales and this year the number is expected to be higher.</TEXT></DOC>
