That covers most everything you can do with a computer.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Computing  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  GREATWORKS COVERS ALL THE BASES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Software  </MEMO><TEXT>     With the advent of MultiFinder, and now System 7.0, the chief selling pointof an integrated program for the Macintosh can no longer be the ease ofmovement and transfer of data from one module to another; it can hardly be anyeasier than it already is.;   But Symantec's people are too sharp to getcaught in a trap like that. Instead, they point up what the program rathergrandly calls its CORE Technologies.;   Basically, what this amounts to isstandardization wherever possible. For instance, once you learn to format textin the writing module, you'll do it the same way in the spreadsheet, theoutliner and the data base. Basic techniques for creating graphics areidentical in the draw, the paint and the data-base program. It's not a greatleap forward from what the Mac interface gives you anyway. It does, however,assure a relatively short learning curve across all the modules except thetelecommunications section, which has little in common with the otherfunctions.;   The outliner module is rich with features, more powerful in itsway than the writing module, which is a pretty standard light-duty wordprocessor. Both are extremely fast.;   The data base is a straightforwardlist-keeper with nice flexibility, and the spreadsheet is a standard one forthe class.;   The graphics sections are relatively light-duty components,also, although they'll handle most users' needs. The draw section, forinstance, does not support dimensioning or Bezier curves. The draw and chartprograms work in and output in color; the paint program is black-and-whiteonly. The chart program uses numbers from the spreadsheet module to make itsgraphs and charts.;   Graphics can easily be imported into the outline,writing, spreadsheet and data-base modules.;   GreatWorks is fully geared forSystem 7.0, which means the balloon option is available. This marvelous idea,which when turned on produces a help balloon for every item the cursortouches, is very useful for the novice.;   The on-line help is fairlyextensive and very nicely structured, complete with graphic elements. Forinstance, it walks you through every step in creating a mail-merge letterusing the data base and the writing module.;   GreatWorks' chief competition,of course, is Microsoft Works, which has been on the Macintosh scene for along time now. It is appreciably more powerful than Works, but it also coststwice as much at $299 list.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JACK WARNER, Cox News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911117  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  459  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, November 17, 199100322036,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
