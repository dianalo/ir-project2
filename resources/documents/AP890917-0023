Critics charge the administration's response, as presented thisweek on Capitol Hill after seven months of deliberations, isinadequate, unimaginative and risks missing a historic opportunity.   Some say the U.S. government could learn a thing or two fromSoviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's open door policy.   The administration argues it is doing its best in the face ofshrinking budgets and the problem of dealing with 14 millionrefugees worldwide, many of whom would like to move to the UnitedStates.   Of the 125,000 refugee slots allocated for fiscal 1990 _ thatstarts Oct. 1 _ 50,000 will be reserved for Soviet applicants, mostof whom are Jews.   The administration predicts as many as 150,000 Soviet Jews willapply for refugee status in fiscal 1990. Jewish groups say as manyas 500,000 Jews may seek to come here in the coming years if thedoors remain open, especially in light of rising anti-Semitism inthe Soviet Union.   An internal State Department report used by Immigration andNaturalization officers in Moscow concluded that glasnost, with itsliberalized rights to free speech and press, has spawneddiscrimination against Jews throughout the Soviet Union.   Religious groups and many on Capitol Hill also argue thatGorbachev's reforms and his political future are by no means assuredsuccess, and their failure could strand thousands of persecutedpeople wishing to leave.   ``Soviet history has painfully demonstrated that lulls ingovernment repression are usually followed by harsh oppression,''said a letter to Congress from World Relief, which representsEvangelical Christians. The Evangelicals constitute a smallpercentage of those seeking to come here.   Members of Congress say if tight budgets are the problem keepingmore Soviets from coming to the United States, ``creativefinancing'' should be considered.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, suggested the government helpadditional refugees by lending them money for their relocation,which would be paid back once they're settled.   ``When the faucets start opening ... the United States findsitself totally incapable of dealing with the very policy it isdemanding,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.   The administration agreed. ``The United States is to some degreea victim of its own success,'' said Deputy Secretary of StateLawrence Eagleburger.   But he argued that although the demand for liberalized Sovietemigration was a cornerstone of U.S. policy for nearly 20 years,``never was it said that the U.S. has an obligation to take them allin.''   He urged other countries, like Western European states, Australiaand Israel, to share the burden.   Israel may be the only clear beneficiary of the surge ofemigration, which could go a long way to beefing up the Jewishpopulation and countering a growing Arab population domestically andin neighboring states. Israeli officials said privately this weekthat once Soviet Jews realize their entry to the United States wassharply restricted, they might choose Israel.   Most Jews and Evangelicals who have left so far have done so onan Israeli visa. Once they get to Rome or Vienna, however, all but10 percent or so shift direction for the United States.   This has created a backlog in Rome and Vienna expected to reach30,000 by Oct. 1. Some have been waiting for 18 months.   Responding to growing pressure from Congress, the administrationpromised this week its first priority would be to clear up thebacklog in Italy and Austria.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in an effort to head offpending legislation that would automatically grant refugee status toall Soviet applicants, announced he had ordered a review of 5,000cases of Soviets in Rome who have been denied refugee status.   Once the backlog is cleared, the Vienna and Rome centers, whichhave cost the United States $34 million annually to maintain, willbe shut. All processing will be handled in Moscow, with a newWashington facility to help.   The administration is negotiating with the Soviets to be allowedto increase its INS embassy staff from three to six officersstarting Oct. 1.   Lawmakers this week ridiculed this solution, saying sixadjudicators would barely make a dent in the wave of applicationsbut noting that because the 1990 quota has already been used up bythe backlogs in Rome and Moscow, this would not matter much, anyway.</TEXT></DOC>
