The Houston-based company said financing was arranged by Spectrum Capital Ltd. of New York, which in conjunction with Mitsubishi International Corp. -- the U.S. investment arm of Tokyo-based Mitsubishi Corp. -- will provide a 50% equity interest in the project. PSE, an operator of cogeneration and waste-heat recovery plants, retains the remaining 50% of the project.    Additionally, Mitsubishi Trust andamp; Banking Corp., a New York-based unit of Mitsubishi, will provide construction and long-term loans for the project.    PSE said two generators, one gas and one steam, will provide about 35,000 kilowatts of electrical power to Southern California Edison under a 30-year contract. In addition, the plant will deliver all required electricity, steam and chilled water to its host facility, a Golden Cheese Co. of California cheese processing plant. </TEXT></DOC>
