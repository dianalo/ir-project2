(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   State wildlife officers arrested fourpeople and confiscated more than 1,000 sea turtle eggs afterstaking out a beach used for nesting by endangered sea turtles.   The eggs were retrieved too late to save them, said Lt. JimHuffstodt, of the state Game and Freshwater Fish Commission.   Huffstodt said the officers spotted four people on a beach nearthe entrance to John D. McArthur State Park early Saturday morning.   ``We had been patrolling... because this is the time of yearwhen the big turtles come up to lay their eggs and some peoplecollect the eggs to sell them as food and as an aphrodisiac,''Huffstodt said Saturday.   The eggs are sold for about $2 each, he said.   Officers Ken Parrmore and Ros Welborn checked the beach afterthe suspects left and found four broken turtle eggs, which aresimilar in size to a chicken egg, Huffstodt. The officers stoppedthe suspects' car two miles down the road in Riviera Beach, about75 miles north of Miami on the Atlantic Coast.   The four were charged with unlawful possession of marine turtleeggs, Huffstodt said.   ``Later we counted them and we found 1,088 eggs,'' he said.   He said the eggs weren't viable because they had been greatlydisturbed. The eggs were put in a freezer to be kept for evidence.   The eggs are believed to be either those of the threatenedloggerhead turtle or the endangered green turtle, he said. Greenturtles average 39 inches long and weigh 330 pounds. Thereddish-brown loggerhead averages 37 inches in length and weighs275 pounds.   ``Normally a sea turtle will lay between 60 and 100 eggs whenshe comes ashore. Certainly these people in their evening's workhad raided 10 or more nests,'' Huffstodt said.   Charged were Riveria Beach residents Enous Lewis Jr., 33;Roosevelt U. Paulk, 27; James E. Bivins, 36; and Joyce Allen, 33.   The maximum penalty for the offense is a $1,000 fine and a yearin jail.</TEXT></DOC>
