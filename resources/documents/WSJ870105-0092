The EPA, implementing a Nov. 7 settlement with producers of pentachlorophenol products, mandated limits on their content of hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (HxCDD), which has caused cancer and birth defects in laboratory animals.    The agency limited HxCDD levels in pentachlorophenol batches to 15 parts per million in the first year. The rule would cut the contaminant to six parts per million in the second year, and three parts per million on a monthly average. After the second year, the allowable level would fall to four parts per million and the monthly average would be cut to two parts per million. At the same time, the rule limits another hazardous dioxin to one part per billion and hexachlorobenzene to 75 parts per million.    The EPA originally proposed an HxCDD limit of two parts per million in July 1984, but pentachlorophenol makers contested that plan and negotiated almost 2 1/2 years before reaching agreement on the new rule.    The EPA also proposed canceling most non-wood preservative uses of pesticide products containing inorganic arsenicals, which are linked to cancer, mutations and birth defects. The agency has been investigating the health risks from these compounds for more than eight years, and few remain in use to control weeds, insects and snails. </TEXT></DOC>
