Elsewhere, rivers flooded by five days of rain slowly receded inKentucky and Tennessee, where hundreds of people were evacuated fromtheir homes.   At least 15 traffic deaths were blamed on stormy weatherbeginning Friday.   By midday, up to 14 inches of snow had fallen on northern NorthCarolina in Warren and Stokes counties, and at historicWilliamsburg, Va., the National Weather Service said. Norfolk, Va.,had 11.2 inches, second highest on record there for February. In theNorthwest, Spokane, Wash., had 13 inches.   Sleet and freezing rain coated other parts of Virginia and theCarolinas with ice, and scattered power outages were reported inupstate South Carolina, the weather service said. About 23,000people lost power in North Carolina, Duke Power Co. officials said.   Despite about a foot of snow, Patrick Henry Airport at NewportNews, Va., remained technically open although all airlines operatingat the airport canceled their flights, said executive director PeterDaikos.   ``I would suspect we had 200 people stranded,'' Daikos said.   Elsewhere in Virginia, Saturday classes at Norfolk StateUniversity were canceled, said school spokesman Gerald Tyler, and anumber of college basketball games were postponed.   ``The roads in the southern half of the state are pretty bad,''said state police Sgt. N.W. Hampton in Richmond. ``It's stillsnowing and they're covered with snow.''   The snow and icy roads in North Carolina arrived just two daysafter the state basked in 80-degree weather. Schools across thestate closed early Friday.   ``Wrecks are coming in from every which direction, and my rescuecrews tell me that roads are really slick out there,'' said BobbyNorville, an emergency communications dispatcher in Pitt County.   Most North Carolina ski resorts had to close in the past twoweeks, but the return of cold air Friday meant snow-making machinerycould run full blast.   Duke Power sent 200 extra workers to help local repair crewsworking to reconnect power lines torn down by ice or falling treelimbs, said spokeswoman Anne Sheffield. She had no estimate of whenpower would be restored.   Steady snow fell Saturday on the eastern two-thirds of Washingtonstate as the most severe snowstorm to hit the state this winterslowed traffic to a crawl.   U.S. 2 near Stevens Pass, Wash., was closed for about two hoursduring the night after an avalanche dumped about 4 feet of snow overthe highway. Hours earlier, at least 35 cars were involved in apile-up in blinding snow on Interstate 90 about five miles east ofNorth Bend.   Up to 9 inches of snow fell at higher elevations of easternTennessee, attracting thousands to the mountain resort town ofGatlinburg.   ``The town is booked pretty well solid since it's a three-dayholiday weekend,'' said Jim Ahrends, a salesman for the OberGatlinburg Ski Resort.   ``We were kind of looking forward to having snow. We woke up thismorning and there it was,'' said Tami Saade, 28, of Atlanta, whospent part of Saturday afternoon sipping brandied coffee with afriend by a fire in the resort lounge.   In western Tennessee, Tennessee Emergency Management Agencyworkers were in Obion County assessing the damage caused by floodingthere earlier in the week. After five days of rain, Saturday was dry.   Nearly 400 people were forced from their homes when the ObionRiver spilled over its banks in the heart of the Tennessee wheatbelt.   The first estimates by federal officials pegged Kentucky's flooddamage at $22 million, but the Army's top engineer, Robert W. Page,assistant secretary of the Army for civil works, said Saturday thatwas ``only the tip of the iceberg.''   Five shelters remained open around Kentucky, housing 142 people,said spokesman Don Armstrong of the state Division of Disaster andEmergency Services, and 184 state-maintained roads in 54 countiesremained blocked by high water.   The Kentucky River at Frankfort had dropped 4 feet since crestingFriday at 44.2 feet _ 13.2 feet above flood stage.   Streams in southern Ohio also receded after flash flooding.   A rain-slickened highway in Texas was blamed for an accident inwhich a bus rolled over and killed four people and injured 20. Andthree traffic deaths in Washington state and four in North Carolinawere blamed on the snow. Four members of one family died Friday inTexas when their van plunged into a swollen stream.
