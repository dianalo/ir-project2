On other commodity markets, stock-index futures plunged;precious metals advanced; grains and soybeans were higher; andenergy futures were mixed.   Meat-packers in western Kansas and Texas paid up to 69 cents apound for fed cattle, apparently to build up their inventories foran expected upswing in retail beef demand before the Labor Dayweekend.   It was the highest price paid for cattle since June 17, whenpackers bid 70 cents a pound, said Thomas Morgan, president ofSterling Research Corp. of Arlington Heights, Ill.   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the price for Augustdelivery of live cattle settled 1.17 cents higher at 69.42 cents apound and the October contract gained 1.50 cents, the maximummovement allowed by the exchange.   ``What pushed the (futures) market up was the speculation _ andspeculation is the key word here _ that the (cash) market might goto 69.50 or 70,'' Morgan said.   But market bears believe packers now have enough cattle on handto satisfy the Labor Day demand and will become less aggressive intheir bidding, he said.   The live-cattle rally spread to the neighboring feeder cattlepit, where limit gains also were recorded, and the pork pits. Mostfrozen pork belly contracts gained 2 cents a pound, the limit inthat market.   Pork bellies also were supported by a Chicago MercantileExchange report indicating an upturn in demand for pork bellies,from which bacon is made.   Live cattle settled .90 cent to 1.50 cents higher with August at69.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .85 cent to 1.50 centshigher with August at 81.22 cents a pound; hogs were .45 cent to1.37 cents higher with August at 45.90 cents a pound; frozen porkbellies were .18 cent to 2 cents higher with August at 34.80 centsa pound.   Tuesday's boost in the discount rate, the rate the FederalReserve charges on short-term loans to member banks, reverberatedthrough financial futures markets on Wednesday. The Fed raised therate half a percentage point to 6.5 percent.   Treasury bonds for September delivery tumbled 1\ points to 8431-32 on the Chicago Board of Trade, and the contract for Septemberdelivery of the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index plunged 5.35points to 262.05 on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   Those declines, combined with a weaker dollar and the rise inagricultural commodity prices, spurred buying of precious metalsfutures, analysts said. Precious metals are considered relativelysafe investments in a turbulent economy.   Silver got an additional boost from ideas that a resolution wasnear in the 3-week-old miners' strike in Peru, said BetteRaptopoulos, precious metals analyst in New York withPrudential-Bache Securities Inc.   A scheduled vote Thursday in the House of Representatives on aproposal for stronger trade sanctions against South Africa gaveplatinum futures prices an extra upward shove, Raptopoulos said.   Platinum for October delivery settled $13.50 higher at $535.80 atroy ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold was $1.70 to $1.80 higherwith August at $429.20 a troy ounce; silver was 8.2 cents to 8.7cents higher with September at $6.71 a troy ounce.   Most crop futures moved higher on the Chicago Board of Trade inlight trading amid nervousness about the Agriculture Department'supcoming crop production report.   Grain and soybean futures were led higher by the soybean mealmarket, which posted strong gains on rumors that the Soviet Unionwas shopping in Argentina for soybean meal pellets, analysts said.   But traders were unwilling to take large risks ahead of the USDAcrop report, which will be released Thursday after the grainmarkets close.   The report is expected to indicate further deterioration ofdrought-stressed crops during July.   Private analysts' predictions of the USDA crop estimatesaveraged out to a 38 percent decline in corn production and a 20percent drop in soybean production from last year's levels.   Wheat settled 2{ cents to 6} cents higher with September at$3.83\ a bushel; corn was { cent to 2{ cents higher with Septemberat $3.00} a bushel; oats were 2 cents to 5 cents higher withSeptember at $2.71{ a bushel; soybeans were 8{ cents lower to 9cents higher with August at $8.64{ a bushel.   Oil futures prices settled mixed, with prices for futuredelivery of wholesale unleaded gasoline skidding lower and crudeand heating oil mixed in generally quiet trading.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 16 cents lower to 3cents higher with September at $15.71 a barrel; heating oil was .05cent to .10 cent higher with September at 44.15 cents a gallon;unleaded gasoline was .58 cent lower to .10 cent higher withSeptember at 45.57 cents a gallon.</TEXT></DOC>
