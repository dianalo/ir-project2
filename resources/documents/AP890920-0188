(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prosecutors wrapped up their caseWednesday at PTL founder Jim Bakker's fraud trial, saying hisministry had sold $157.9 million worth of lodging rights to 152,903believers by the time he quit.   The government showed the jury a final piece of videotape showingBakker urging his followers to send money for so-called lifetimepartnerships in his ministry.   Prosecutors contend that Bakker used the money raised throughpartnership sales to finance a lavish lifestyle instead of buildinglodging he had promised the partners, who were supposed to get a fewdays of free lodging every year.   The government case in Bakker's fraud and conspiracy trialstarted Aug. 28.   Before presenting their evidence, Bakker's attorneys asked thatthe charges be dismissed, saying Bakker's rights were beingviolated, not those of his followers.   ``What we have is a ministry, a religious entity,'' said AttorneyHarold Bender said. ``Everything it did was religious in nature. TheConstitution prohibits government interference in a religion.''   Prosecutor Jerry Miller disagreed, saying: ``This is not a caseabout religion. It is a case about lying to the people on televisionand cheating them out of their money.''   The motion was denied by U.S. District Judge Robert Potter, andthe defense began by showing the jury more tapes of the PTLtelevision show.   Earlier, FBI agent John Pearson recapped testimony showing thatas of May 31, 1987 _ two months after Bakker resigned _ PTL had152,903 fully paid partnerships costing $157.9 million.   Pearson said contributors sent $66.9 million for Heritage Grandpartnerships and about 52.8 percent of that was spent onconstruction of the hotel.   More than $74 million was spent for Towers Hotel partnerships,Pearson said, and 15.4 percent of that was spent on the partiallybuilt hotel. About $17 million was sent by believers forpartnerships in bunkhouses and 5.6 percent was spent on constructionof one 16-room bunkhouse.   Testimony showed that Bakker sold lodging rights in a 16-roombunkhouse to more than 42,000 people and agreed to cut the number ofbunkhouses in half while urging more people to send money.   During a broadcast of his ``PTL Club'' show, Bakker told viewershe wasn't trying to profit from lifetime partnership sales at PTL'sHeritage Park USA complex in Fort Mill, S.C.   ``We're not here to make money,'' Bakker said in an August 1986broadcast. ``I hope my critics wake up and realize I'd be a fool ifI tried to make money off something like this.''   ``This is a deal of a lifetime,'' Bakker told viewers in anotherAugust promotional broadcast. ``There are no fees. This is not aprofit-making organization.''   Bakker's comments came while he offered a new lodging programcalled the Family Heritage Club. Donors of $500 would get three daysand two nights in 16-unit ``bunkhouses,'' he said. Only onebunkhouse was completed when Bakker resigned in disgrace in March1987.   Bakker is accused in 24 fraud and conspiracy counts of divertingmore than $3.7 million in PTL money raised from the partnershipsales to pay for personal luxuries. If found guilty of the 24 countsagainst him, he could be sentenced to 120 years in prison and finedmore than $5 million.   At one point, Bakker said all the partnerships available had beensold. Then in March 1987, second-in-command Richard Dortch said in atelethon that more partnerships in the never-finished Towers Hotelwere available because 70 percent of the people on the monthlyinstallment plan had not lived up to their obligations.   The first defense videotape showed a July 4, 1984, dedicationceremony at Heritage USA for three facilities: a water park, a homefor handicapped children called ``Kevin's House,'' and Fort Hope forthe homeless.</TEXT></DOC>
