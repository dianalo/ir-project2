To view these relative to the conventional class of DC tractionmotor, usually having a series-connected wound field, the following objectivesmay be listed. Increased power density, for size and weight reduction,assisted by capability for operation at higher speed. Increased efficiency,for improved fuel consumption and increased range as well as reducedmotor temperatures. Improved reliability, for long life and low maintenance.Cost reduction, including the cost of electronic power-conditioning circuits.Overload capability, for good drive performance including accelerationand hill climbing, with reference to both torque capacity and thermalbehaviour. Compact design to suit available space. Controllability, forefficient operation under a range of conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
