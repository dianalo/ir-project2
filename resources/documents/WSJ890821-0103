But in a letter to Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, Seabrook's 35.6%-owner, commission officials said they &quot;remain concerned&quot; about Seabrook plant managers' faulty handling of the mishap. The NRC said officials of New Hampshire Yankee, which operates Seabrook for its utility owners, committed &quot;potential violations of NRC requirements&quot; during the test. The commission said it will decide on &quot;enforcement action&quot; concerning the incident, after meeting with Seabrook officials on Sept. 7. The NRC also scheduled a public meeting on the incident for Sept. 6 in Durham, N.H.    The incident threatens to delay Seabrook's long-delayed commercial start-up. The plant was shut down June 22 during a low-power test because of a malfunctioning steam valve. In their report on the incident, NRC officials stated that the plant's safety wasn't threatened during the test.    But they noted that New Hampshire Yankee's plant operators and supervisors failed to stop the test for several minutes after the steam valve malfunctioned, even though NRC observers present at the time told the Seabrook managers that test procedures required the reactor to be shut down. After being told by an NRC observer that the reactor was in a mode requiring shutdown, one Seabrook manager &quot;continued to watch the in-progress test, appeared to take no action, and gave no oral response,&quot; according to the NRC report.    The NRC report also criticized plant managers for &quot;apparent willingness&quot; to proceed with further Seabrook tests before a thorough review of the mishap was conducted.    Following the plant shutdown, New Hampshire Yankee realigned senior management at the plant and instituted new operating and reporting procedures. In its report, the NRC stated that New Hampshire Yankee's Seabrook operators and managers &quot;now recognize that testing {of the nuclear plant} can proceed only if done so in accordance with test procedure requirements.&quot; Edward A. Brown, New Hampshire Yankee's president, said the NRC's report on the incident is &quot;generally consistent&quot; with New Hampshire Yankee's earlier report on it. A spokesman for New Hampshire Yankee said it will &quot;review the NRC report to see if further actions are needed. But we don't foresee a delay in full-power licensing&quot; needed for Seabrook's commercial start-up. New Hampshire Yankee previously said it expects to receive the license by the end of this year. </TEXT></DOC>
