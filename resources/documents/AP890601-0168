SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A genetically engineered drug that can helpreduce anemia in patients suffering from kidney failure and mayalso benefit cancer and AIDS patients was approved Thursday by theFood and Drug Administration.   ``My life has been changed dramatically,'' said John G. Cole ofAvon Lake, Ohio, who took part in the clinical trials of the drugepoetin.   The new drug is a copy of a natural human protein,erythropoietin, which stimulates the body to produce red bloodcells.   Lack of those cells, which carry energy-giving oxygen around thebody, is known as anemia. And since the kidneys produceerythropoietin, patients with kidney failure often develop anemia.   Food and Drug Commissioner Frank Young said that in addition toabout 95,000 kidney patients who should benefit from the new drug,it also may be useful to chronically anemic patients suffering fromother diseases, such as cancer and AIDS.   The approval announced Thursday was aimed at kidney patients,and the drug was developed under the orphan drug program whichgives companies financial encouragement to produce products tobenefit relatively small numbers of people, generally fewer than200,000.   But once approved for sale, physicians may use a drug for otherpurposes.   Cole, an editor at The Journal in Lorain, Ohio, described thedrug as ``great stuff.''   Before entering the program, Cole said, ``taking the trash outwas a difficult trip down the driveway'' and a walk on the beachentailed asking his wife to wait for him.   Now, he said, he no longer requires weekly blood transfusions inaddition to his dialysis, exercises three times a week, walks onthe beach and works 50 to 55 hours a week.   ``I'm never going to be able to play full-court basketball, mydisease has limitations, but I can play a hell of a game ofhalf-court,'' he commented.   Young explained that anemia in most kidney patients has beentreated by transfusions, which results in ``ups and downs'' intheir energy levels. In addition, while blood is screened, theirremains the small possibility of infection from blood.   With epoetin, the body produces its own red cells, keepingenergy at a constant level and avoiding the need for transfusionsin 95 percent of patients, he said.   The drug was developed in 1983 and the only problems reported intrials were those already seen in kidney failure patients who didnot get the drug, high blood pressure, headache, chest pain and insome patients siezures.   Epoetin will be marketed by Amgen of Thousand Oaks, Calif.,under the trade name Epogen. Amgen said a typical patient willreceive injections of the drug three times a week. The cost willrange between $4,000 and $8,000 annually, the company said.   Young said a decision on whether the drug will be covered byfederal assistance programs is under discussion.   Epoetin is produced by inserting the human gene which causesproduction of erythropoietin into Chinese hamster ovary cells.These cells then produce large amounts of epoetin, Young said.   A slightly different drug for the same use is also underdevelopment in a joint effort by Chugai Pharmaceutical Co. of Japanand the Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo, Mich., Young said.</TEXT></DOC>
