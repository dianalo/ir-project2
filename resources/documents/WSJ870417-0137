Today's announcement of U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic products will be followed by more actions. In the pipeline are U.S. demands for Japan to buy more American auto parts and farm products, including rice. The Senate Finance Committee begins work this month on a trade bill designed partly to help specific industries, such as telecommunications, break into Japan.    Americans, by a 69%-25% vote, support new tariffs on Japanese items sold in the U.S., according to the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll. Meanwhile, Treasury chief Baker presses Japan to cut interest rates in order to stabilize the dollar and stem demands on the Fed to tighten. &quot;They'd take a lot of pressure off us here if they would ease,&quot; a top Fed official says.    &quot;We've just got to push and push,&quot; maintains Wisconsin Sen. Kasten. &quot;Normal diplomacy does no good with the Japanese.&quot;    SYRIA'S SIGNALS of moderation stir both optimism and skepticism.    Some U.S. and Middle East officials are cheered by recent actions. A top CIA analyst says that President Assad has curbed terrorist training by Palestinian leader Abu Nidal in Syria and Lebanon. Syria tells a Jordanian envoy that it is willing to attend a Middle East peace conference. Why the change? &quot;Survival,&quot; says a Jordanian official, who cites Syria's troubled economy.    But some U.S. officials don't think Assad will risk a showdown with Shiite radicals in Lebanon and their backers in Iran. Egypt, after discreetly sending an envoy to Damascus, doesn't sense any real moderation. And senior Israeli officials doubt the Syrians would really participate in a peace conference. An important test may be whether Syria can win the release of hostages.    REAGANITES SEEK a high-visibility profile to boost the president.    They want to offset negative news from the coming Iran-Contra hearings and a possible Deaver trial. A May meeting in South America on drug issues falls through, but it may be rescheduled for July. Advisers hope for progress on arms control, perhaps including a Reagan-Gorbachev summit in the U.S.    The June economic summit in Venice may be expanded to include such issues as AIDS. Reagan also considers creating a presidential commission on AIDS. A budget meeting with congressional leaders is pondered, too. Despite such efforts, Reagan fails to rebound in the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll; more than half of the public still thinks he is doing an &quot;only fair&quot; or a &quot;poor&quot; job.    By a 77%-17% ratio, those polled give the president a negative rating on his handling of the Iran-Contra situation.    BAD NEWS for Bush emerges in the new Journal/NBC poll. The number of people with an unfavorable opinion of him rises to 43% from 33% last month, nearly equaling his 46% favorable rating. Bush still holds a small lead over Dole for the GOP presidential nomination, but Dole has higher favorable ratings and lower unfavorables.    MOVING FORCE? An association of state securities regulators will move its headquarters to Washington from Topeka, Kan., to try to counter Wall Street lobbyists. The regulators, who criticize the SEC's hands-off stance on corporate takeovers, meet with Senate Banking Chairman Proxmire to push anti-takeover legislation.    GOP INFIGHTING erupts over the Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairmanship. Utah Sen. Garn, the ranking Banking Committee Republican, pushes his longtime aide M. Danny Wall for the post. But eight GOP senators write the White House to back Philip Winn, a Colorado businessman and Republican fund-raiser.    JUMPING SHIP: Less than two years ago, the National Journal profiled 321 top decision makers in the Reagan administration. The magazine went back this week and found that 149 of them, or almost half, have quit their jobs. The highest turnovers were at the departments of state, agriculture and justice.    DEMOCRATS JOCKEY to emerge as Hart's chief rival in early 1988.    Gephardt and Babbitt are seen as the top challengers in Iowa. Gephardt will spend a week of each month there; &quot;Iowa is about time on the ground,&quot; he says. Babbitt seeks to reach every 1984 Iowa caucus goer by phone or mail. Dukakis is strong in New Hampshire but will be hurt if he runs badly in the initial Iowa test. He was poorly prepared for a recent trip there and flopped.    Biden has a top staff and is an impressive fund-raiser but shows little political support in Iowa or New Hampshire. Newcomers Simon and Gore lack the experience to mount major efforts. Only one or two men will probably survive as strong Hart foes in the Southern and Midwestern primaries. Jackson's hold on black voters seems secure, though Biden will try to woo them.    Hart and Babbitt, trying to make integrity an issue, refuse PAC contributions, hoping to embarrass Gephardt for taking them.    MINOR MEMOS: A Washington store advertises &quot;The First Annual Imelda Marcos Shoe Sale.&quot; . . . A report by the President's Council on Integrity andamp; Efficiency includes a foreword by Ronald &quot;R.&quot; Reagan. . . . Comedian Mark Russell says &quot;there is no smoking gun&quot; in the Iran-Contra affair &quot;because we sold it to Iran.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
