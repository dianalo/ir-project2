Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspectedof being a spy.   Gennady I. Gerasimov, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, saidallegations that Bloch was a spy for the Soviet Union were a resultof a new ``wave of spy mania'' caused by the U.S. media.   In a follow-up to questions asked Wednesday, Gerasimov said hemade inquiries about Bloch's activities. ``The name of Bloch wasnot familiar. We have no connection with him. We have nothing to dowith him,'' he told a regular news briefing.   ``It is lamentable that the U.S. press fans such hysteria,''Gerasimov added.   The State Department has confirmed it is investigating Bloch,formerly posted to the U.S. Embassy in Vienna, for alleged``illegal activities'' involving ``agents of a foreign intelligenceservice.''   Bloch has not been charged with any crime. He has been undersurveillance in the New York area.   News leaks from unidentified sources in Washington said therewas a videotape of Bloch passing a briefcase to a Soviet agent inParis and that the same agent later allegedly telephoned Bloch witha warning that he was under suspicion.   Bloch today left the East Side co-op in Manhattan where he hadspent several days and drove off alone in a car with Washington,D.C., license plates.   He said nothing to a group or reporters waiting outside thebuilding.   Bloch, a career American diplomat, was deputy chief of missionat the U.S. Embassy in Vienna from 1980 to 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
