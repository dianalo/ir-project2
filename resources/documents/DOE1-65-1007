However, neitherparadigm adequately explains U.S. national security decision making asit relates to strategic arms limitation since 1966. Although each paradigmoffers insight into U.S. strategic arms limitation decision making atcertain times, at critical junctures the decision making more closelyresembles domestic decision making. When this is so, coalition politicstranscends institutional boundaries, socioeconomic considerations andpolitical interests become germane, the electoral and lobbying processesbecome influential, and the concerns for broader societal impacts ofpolicy choices become critical. This chapter explores the following questionsabout these two explanations of U.S. strategic arms limitation decisionmaking: (1) What are the general propositions of the two paradigms? (2)Are the paradigms deficient in explaining U.S. strategic arms limitationdecision making? (3) If so, what factors limit the paradigms in explainingU.S. strategic arms limitation decision making? (4) What are the implicationsof this analysis for future U.S. strategic arms limitation decision making?</TEXT></DOC>
