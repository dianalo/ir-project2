Before the      polyurethane coating is applied, a zinc layer is applied so as to coat the      fastener, and a chromate conversion layer is applied so as to coat the      zinc layer. </PAL></ABST><PARN> <PAR>  This is a division of application Ser. No. 07/414,793, filed Sep. 29, 1989,      now U.S. Pat. No. 4,964,774. </PAR></PARN><BSUM> <PAC>  TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention pertains to a metal fastener, such as, for example, a nail,      staple, or truss plate, which exhibits excellent properties including a      reduced penetration force, an increased withdrawal force, and a reduced      corrosion tendency. This invention also pertains to a method of coating      such a fastener so as to provide the foregoing properties. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Generally, it is known to protect various metal fasteners and other metal      articles against corrosion by means of electroplating their surfaces with      zinc and chromating the electroplated surfaces. Moreover, it is known to      cover the chromated surfaces with polymeric materials. </PAR><PAR>  In Palisin, Jr., U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,790,355 and 3,977,839, hydrophobic,      thermosetting polymers made from coating compositions containing      hexamethoxy methyl melamine are proposed for covering such chromated      surfaces. In Labenski et al. U.S. Pat. No. 4,003,760, so-called      fluoroplastic materials, such as, for example, polytetrafluoroethylene,      are proposed for covering such chromated surfaces. </PAR><PAR>  Parkinson et al. U.S. Pat. No. 3,853,606 discloses a coating composition      that is described therein as combining properties of increased holding      power, corrosion resistance, and lubrication. The coating composition      contains two thermoplastic resins, namely a flexible carboxyl or      substituted carboxyl-containing resin and a rosin-like resin. An organic      solvent is required, which is undesirable in an industrial environment      because such a solvent produces hazardous vapors and hazardous wastes. </PAR><PAR>  Metal fasteners used in connection with wooden construction present special      requirements, for which polymeric materials used to protect metal articles      of other types may not be well suited. These fasteners include nails,      staples, and truss plates. Typically, the metal of such fasteners is      carbon steel. </PAR><PAR>  Desirably, a polymeric material covering a metal fastener used in      connection with wood construction should serve not only to protect the      fastener against corrosion but also to cause the fastener to exhibit an      increased withdrawal force when the fastener has been driven into a wooden      workpiece. Withdrawal force, which may also be discussed in terms of      holding power, is the force that is required to withdraw such a fastener      from a given workpiece. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, a polymeric material covering a metal fastener used in      connection with wood construction should resist chipping or tearing away,      particularly when the fastener is struck by means of a driving element of      a pneumatically powered, combustion-powered, or other rapidly acting      fastener-driving tool. </PAR><PAR>  Optimally, a polymeric material covering a metal fastener used in      connection with wood construction would serve moreover to cause the      fastener to exhibit a decreased penetration force when the fastener is      driven into a wooden workpiece. Penetration force is the force required to      drive such a fastener into a given workpiece. </PAR><PAR>  However, it is difficult to identify a polymeric material that would not      require an organic solvent when applied to such a fastener and that would      serve not only to protect the fastener against corrosion, to cause the      fastener to exhibit an increased withdrawal force, and to resist chipping      or tearing away, but also to cause the fastener to exhibit a reduced      penetration force. </PAR><PAR>  Although known coatings for metal articles may be generally satisfactory in      many applications, there has been a need, to which this invention is      addressed, for improved coatings for metal fasteners, particularly for      metal fasteners suitable for wood construction, such as, for example,      nails, staples, or truss plates. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention provides a metal fastener having a coating that does not      require an organic solvent when applied to the fastener and that reduces      penetration force, increases withdrawal force, resists chipping or tearing      away, and protects against corrosion. This invention also provides a      method for applying such a coating to a metal fastener. </PAR><PAR>  This invention is applicable particularly but not exclusively to a metal      fastener of a type made of carbon steel and suitable for wood      construction. Preferably, the fastener is a nail, staple, or truss plate.      However, fasteners made of aluminum and fasteners made of copper alloys,      such as, for example, bronze, are equally well suited for the practice of      this invention. </PAR><PAR>  According to this invention, the fastener is coated with a thermoplastic,      polymeric residue that contains a predominantly aliphatic polyurethane.      The thermoplastic, polymeric residue provides a tough, adherent coating      that reduces penetration force, increases withdrawal force, resists      chipping or tearing away, and protects against corrosion. The      thermoplastic, polymeric residue is produced by drying a film-forming,      predominantly aliphatic polyurethane resin which is applied to the      fastener in a liquid medium, preferably an aqueous medium. Thus, the      polymeric coating does not require an organic solvent when applied to the      fastener. </PAR><PAR>  The liquid medium that contains the resin is applied, such as, for example,      by means of dipping, spraying, roller coating, or like expedients, so as      to coat a substantial part of the fastener, and preferably the entire      fastener. The liquid is then removed at an elevated temperature so as to      form a film from the resin that is present upon the fastener. Water is the      preferred liquid medium for the resin. </PAR><PAR>  For enhanced anti-corrosion properties, a metal fastener embodying the      present invention can be galvanized within an electroplating or hot-dip      process or otherwise precoated with a zinc layer prior to application of      the thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic polyurethane coating thereto. A      chromate conversion layer can also be provided, if desired, over the zinc      layer prior to application of the ultimate or outermost polyurethane      coating, of the type hereinabove described, to the metal fastener. </PAR><PAR>  The zinc and chromate conversion layers, if present, serve to provide      corrosion protection in the event of localized chipping or tearing away of      the aforenoted aliphatic polyurethane outermost coating as the metal      fastener embodying the present invention is used. Such layers, if present,      also provide corrosion protection if and where such ultimate or outermost      coating does not completely cover the metal fastener. </PAR><PAR>  A coated fastener according to this invention exhibits excellent properties      including a reduced penetration force, an increased withdrawal force, and      excellent protection against corrosion. The present fasteners are      particularly well suited for use with wood that can be easily stained,      such as, for example, cedar or redwood, and with wood that has been      chemically treated, such as, for example copper-chromium-arsenate treated      wood. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  These and other objects, features, and advantages of this invention will      become more evident from the following description of a preferred      embodiment of this invention with reference to the accompanying drawings      in which like reference characters designate like or corresponding parts      throughout the several views, and wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is an elevational view of a nail constituting a preferred embodiment      of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a cross-sectional view on a slightly larger scale, as taken along      plane 2--2 of FIG. 1 in a direction indicated by means of the arrows. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a fragmentary, elevational view on a slightly smaller scale,      showing a collated strip of nails similar to the nail of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a staple constituting an alternative      embodiment of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a simplified, perspective view of a truss plate constituting a      further embodiment of this invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  According to this invention, a metal fastener suitable for use in      connection with wood construction has a thermoplastic, predominantly      aliphatic polyurethane coating over substantially its entire metal      surface. The coating resists chipping or tearing away and causes the      fastener to exhibit excellent properties including a reduced penetration      force, an increased withdrawal force, and a reduced corrosion tendency.      The coated fastener is particularly well suited for use with wood that can      be easily stained, such as, for example, cedar or redwood, and with wood      that has been chemically treated, such as, for example,      copper-chromium-arsenate treated wood. </PAR><PAR>  The polyurethane coating is a polymeric residue that is produced by      removing water from an aqueous dispersion of a film-forming,      thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic polyurethane resin, as specified      below. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the aqueous dispersion is applied to the nail or other fastener      by dipping the nail into the aqueous dispersion so as to coat the      fastener. The aqueous dispersion can be alternatively applied by means of      spraying, roller coating, or like expedients, so as to coat the fastener. </PAR><PAR>  After the fastener has been coated with the aqueous dispersion, the coated      fastener is heated so as to remove water from the aqueous dispersion,      thereby forming a film of the polymeric residue. The polymeric residue      provides a tough, adherent, polymeric film that protects the fastener      against corrosion, resists chipping or tearing away, and causes the      fastener to exhibit a reduced penetration force as well as an increased      withdrawal force. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, before the polymeric coating is applied thereto, the fastener      is galvanized within an electroplating or hot-dip bath or the like or      otherwise precoated with a zinc layer, over which a chromate conversion      layer is applied. The zinc and chromate conversion layers coated upon the      fastener protect the fastener against corrosion in the event of localized      chipping or tearing away of the thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic      polyurethane coating, which constitutes the ultimate or outermost coating      upon the fastener. The zinc and chromate conversion layers also protect      the fastener against corrosion of the same, particularly where such      ultimate or outermost coating does not completely cover the fastener. </PAR><PAR>  The zinc layer may be conveniently applied by means of a known      electroplating process. Preferably, the zinc layer has a thickness of      approximately 0.2 to approximately 0.6 mil, and more preferably      approximately 0.5 mil so as to comply with Federal Building Code      FF-N-105B, which is referenced to American Society for Testing Materials      (ASTM) Specification A641, Class 1, Type 2. Suitable electroplating      processes are known in the art. See, for example, Lowenheim, Ed., Modern      Electroplating, John Wiley andamp; Sons, Inc., New York (1974) at Chaper 16. </PAR><PAR>  The chromate conversion layer may be conveniently applied by means of a      known chromating process. Preferably, a golden yellow (yellow iridescent)      chromate conversion layer is applied. A dark olive drab, or dark black      chromate conversion layer may be alternatively applied, if desired.      Suitable chromating processes are known in the art. See, for example,      Mohler, Electroplating and Related Processes, Chemical Publishing Co.,      Inc., New York (1969) at Chapter 14. Also suitable for this purpose is the      chromate conversion layer provided by means of the Alodine process      described in Spruance, Jr., U.S. Pat. No. 2,438,877. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the polymeric coating is applied within approximately two weeks      after the zinc and chromate conversion layers are applied. In some      instances, if the polymeric coating is not applied until later than      approximately two weeks after the zinc and chromate conversion layers are      applied, a bond of reduced adhesive strength tends to form between the      chromate conversion layer and the polymeric coating. The applied chromate      conversion layer, if more than approximately two weeks old, can be      rejuvenated, however, by means of a chemical post-treatment process. For      this purpose, an aqueous sulfuric acid dip can be employed or an aqueous      solution of sodium dichromate acidified with sulfuric acid. </PAR><PAR>  It is believed that the polymeric coating, which is thermoplastic, fuses      partially as the nail or other fastener is driven, because of      friction-generated heat, but resolidifies quickly. It is also believed      that, while it is fused partially, the polymeric coating acts as a      lubricant so as to reduce the penetration force. It is further believed      that, as the polymeric coating resolidifies, the polymeric coating bonds      mechanically to the wood fibers surrounding the fastener so as to increase      the withdrawal force. </PAR><PAR>  Where the polymeric coating remains intact, the polymeric coating together      with the zinc and chromate conversion layers protect the nail or other      fastener against corrosion. In regions where the polymeric coating has      been chipped or torn away, as where the nail or other fastener has been      struck by means of a driving element of a fastener-driving tool, the zinc      and chromate conversion layers nevertheless protect the nail or other      fastener against corrosion. </PAR><PAR>  As an alternative to or as an adjunct to such zinc and chromate conversion      layers, a protective coating of a different type may be applied to the      fastener so as to cover the metal surfaces of the nail or other fastener,      before the polymeric coating noted above is applied thereto. The      protective coating may be, for example, a zinc phosphate layer or an iron      phosphate layer. Such a phosphate layer may be applied by means of dipping      the nail or other fastener into a phosphating bath of a suitable      composition. Alternatively, the protective coating may be a layer of tin,      zinc, aluminum, or stainless steel, as applied to the metal surfaces of      the nail or other fastener in accordance with a flame-spraying or      plasma-spraying process. </PAR><PAR>  The polymeric coating can be advantageously used with any type of wood. The      polymeric coating provides excellent results with wood that stains easily,      such as, for example, cedar or redwood, and with wood that has been      chemically treated, such as, for example, copper-chromium-arsenate treated      wood. </PAR><PAR>  A coated fastener according to this invention is superior to other      fasteners used in connection with wood construction in that a coated      fastener according to this invention exhibits a reduced penetration force,      an increased withdrawal force, and a reduced corrosion tendency. </PAR><PAR>  A coated nail 10, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 2, constitutes a preferred      embodiment of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  The coated nail 10 has a metal body 12, which is made of carbon steel,      preferably AISI C 1008 steel. Its metal surfaces are covered completely      with an inner zinc layer 14, an intermediate chromate conversion layer 16,      and an outer, thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic polyurethane coating      18. </PAR><PAR>  The inner zinc layer 14, as applied by means of a known electroplating      process, has a thickness of at least 0.5 mil so as to comply with Federal      Building Code FF-N-105B, which is referenced to ASTM Specification A641,      Class 1, Type 2. Preferably, as applied over the inner zinc layer 14 by      means of a known chromating process, the chromate conversion layer 16 is a      golden yellow (yellow iridescent) chromate conversion layer. A dark olive      drab or dark black chromate conversion layer may be alternatively applied      over the zinc layer 14, if desired. </PAR><PAR>  As applied over the zinc and chromate conversion layers by means of the      method disclosed herein, preferably within approximately two weeks after      such layers are applied, the outer polyurethane coating 18 has a thickness      of approximately 0.5 mil. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 3, a plurality of coated nails 20, each of which is      similar to the coated nail 10, are collated into a strip, which fits into      a magazine (not shown) of a fastener driving tool, by means of a pair of      collating tapes 22 (one shown) generally as disclosed in Langas et al.      U.S. Pat. No. 3,276,576. The coated nails 20 are situated between the      collating tapes 22 and are adhesively attached thereto. </PAR><PAR>  The metal surfaces of each coated nail 20 are completely covered with an      inner zinc layer 14, as described above, and with an intermediate chromium      conversion layer, as described above. The zinc and chromate conversion      layers are applied to each coated nail 20 before such coated nail 20 is      situated between and adhesively attached to the collating tapes 22. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, the metal surfaces of each coated nail 20 are covered at least      substantially with an outer, thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic      polyurethane coating, as described above. Preferably, a continuous outer      polyurethane coating is applied to each coated nail 20 before such coated      nail 20 is adhesively attached to and between the collating tapes 22.      However, the outer polyurethane coating may be alternatively applied to      each coated nail 20 after such coated nail 20 has been adhesively attached      to and between the collating tapes 22, in which event the outer      polyurethane coating upon each coated nail 20 is discontinuous in those      regions where such coated nail 20 is masked by means of the upon adhesive      the collating tapes 22. </PAR><PAR>  Furthermore, this invention may be advantageously applied to such coated      nails (not shown) collated by means of other known types of collating      media, such as, for example, polymeric collating media or welded collating      wires. </PAR><PAR>  A coated staple 30, as shown in FIG. 4, constitutes yet another embodiment      of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  The coated staple 30 has a metal body, which is made of carbon steel,      preferably AISI C 1008 steel. Its metal surfaces are completely covered      with an inner zinc layer, as described above, an intermediate chromate      conversion layer, as described above, and an outer, thermoplastic,      predominantly aliphatic polyurethane coating, as described above. </PAR><PAR>  The coated staple 30 may be one of a series (not shown) of similar staples      that are collated. The outer, thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic      polyurethane coating upon each of such staples including the coated staple      30 may be advantageously used to collate such staples by being applied to      such staples after such staples have been placed in a series, that is, in      side-to-side relationship with respect to one another. </PAR><PAR>  A coated truss plate 40, as shown in FIG. 5, constitutes yet another      embodiment of this invention. </PAR><PAR>  The coated truss plate 40 is formed from a planar member 42, from which a      plurality of pointed teeth 44 are struck. The truss plate 40 usually is      made of carbon steel, such as, for example, AISI C 1008 steel. Preferably,      the truss plate 40 is covered in its entirety with an inner zinc layer, as      described above, an intermediate chromium conversion layer, as described      above, and an outer, thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic polyurethane      coating, as described above. </PAR><PAR>  The coated truss plate 40 may be alternatively made from a galvanized, that      is, zinc-coated, steel sheet, which sheet has been galvanized by means of      a hot-dip or other process. When the teeth 44 are struck from the planar      member 42, the edges of the teeth 44 and the edges of the openings      remaining within the planar member 42 by means of the teeth 44 are exposed      without any zinc coating upon the exposed edges. In order to provide      corrosion protection for such exposed edges, the truss plate 40 may be      subsequently immersed within a phosphating bath so as to apply a phosphate      coating upon the exposed edges as well as upon the other parts of the      metal body. A zinc phosphate coating is preferred. An iron phosphate      coating may be alternatively applied. Next, an intermediate chromate      conversion layer, as described above, and an outer, thermoplastic,      predominantly aliphatic polyurethane coating, as described above, are      applied to the truss plate 40 in its entirety. The intermediate chromium      conversion layer may be optionally omitted. </PAR><PAR>  The preferred polymeric coating materials contemplated by means of this      invention are water-dispersible, thermoplastic polymers that contain as a      major constituent thereof a film-forming aliphatic polyurethane that may      or may not be blocked. The novel fasteners embodying this invention have      their surfaces in contact with the polymeric residue produced, as      mentioned above, by removing the water from an aqueous dispersion of a      film-forming, thermoplastic, predominantly aliphatic polyurethane resin.      The term &quot;aliphatic&quot;, as used herein and in the appended claims,      encompasses straight-chain aliphatic as well as alicyclic or      cycloaliphatic polyurethane resins. Upon drying at an elevated      temperature, these aliphatic polyurethane resins form a film that may      include cross-linked aliphatic polyurethane chains. </PAR><PAR>  The film-forming, thermoplastic polyurethane resin compositions based upon      predominantly aliphatic components and thus suitable for practicing the      present invention are aqueous dispersions, that is, emulsions or      solutions, of aliphatic polyurethane polymers that are the reaction      products of a linear, branched, or cyclic aliphatic isocyanate with a      linear, branched or cyclic aliphatic polyhydroxylated organic compound,      such as, for example, a polyol such as, for example, ethylene glycol,      penetanediol, diethylene glycol, and the like, or a hydroxyl-terminated      polyether or polyester, such as, for example, poly(oxytetramethylene)diol,      and the like. The term &quot;predominantly aliphatic&quot;, as used herein and in      the appended claims, denotes a resin that may contain a minor amount of an      aromatic material as long as such material does not permit      light-degradation of the polyurethane so as to cause an unacceptable or      non-aesthetic degree of discoloration or coating discontinuity. Anionic or      non-ionic surfactants are usually present in these dispersions. </PAR><PAR>  Particularly suitable aqueous, aliphatic, polyurethane resin-containing      dispersions suitable for the present purposes include NeoRez XR-9637.TM.      aqueous dispersions and blends of NeoRez XR-9637.TM. with a minor amount      of a NeoCryl A-600.TM. series aqueous acrylic dispersion, all commercially      available from ICI Resins (Polyvinyl Chemical Industries), Wilmington,      Mass. These dispersions are formed by dissolving the film-forming      aliphatic polyurethane resin, or prepolymer, within a suitable      non-reactive organic solvent for the resin, adding a sufficient amount of      the surfactant having the appropriate hydrophylic-lipophylic balance (HLB)      value, and then gradually mixing the obtained solution with sufficient      water so as to form a stable emulsion of droplets of the produced solution      in water. The emulsion may contain accelerators, if desired, as well as,      for example, optional cross-linking agents such as water-reducible      hexamethoxylated melamine resins or the like. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing dispersions are thermoplastic polyurethane resin lattices of      a relatively high molecular weight, aliphatic, isocyanate-based,      film-forming thermoplastic elastomer within a water dispersion with an      anionic or non-ionic surfactant. </PAR><PAR>  Blocked film-forming aliphatic polyurethane resins suitable for present      purposes are formed by means of the reaction of an aliphatic      polyisocyanate, e.g., 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate (HDI),      4'-diisocyanatodicyclohexylmethane (HMDI), isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI),      or the like, adducts of polyol or hydroxyl-terminated polyether or      hydroxyltterminated polyester resins with an end-blocking compound      containing active hydrogen atoms, such as, for example, an amide or a      polyamide, in accordance with conventional techniques for the production      of blocked polyurethane resins. Illustrative of these resins are Rucothane      Latexes 2010L, 2030L, 2040L, and 2060L, all commercially available from      the Ruco Division of Hooker Chemical Corporation, Niagara Falls, N.Y., and      the like. </PAR><PAR>  The amount of the film-forming aliphatic polyurethane resin present within      the aqueous coating composition is within the range of approximately 10 to      approximately 50 percent by weight, based upon the weight of the coating      composition. The solids content can be adjusted so as to provide the      desired viscosity for the coating composition. Preferably, a coating      composition suitable for dipping contains approximately 20 to      approximately 23 percent by weight of the aliphatic polyurethane resin,      based upon the weight of the coating composition. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous coating composition can be applied to the fastener in any      convenient manner, such as, for example, by means of dipping, spraying,      roller coating, or the like expedients, depending upon the nature and      configuration of the fasteners involved. A preferred method of      application, suitable for use with a wide variety of fasteners, is      dipping. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous coating composition is applied to the fastener so as to      provide, after drying, a film-like solid deposit that is present upon the      fastener as a substantially continuous film encasing the fastener and      having a thickness of approximately 0.2 mil to approximately 2 mils. A      preferred coating thickness is approximately 0.5 mil. </PAR><PAR>  Drying, and possible curing, of the aliphatic polyurethane resin deposited      upon the fastener is effected by drying the coated fasteners at a      temperature of approximately 145.degree. F., or higher, but below the      degradation temperature of the cured aliphatic polyurethane. Preferably,      the temperature is in a range of from approximately 145.degree. F. to      approximately 155.degree. F. More preferably, the temperature is      approximately 150.degree. F. The degree of cross-linking in a particular      instance is dependent upon the specific composition of the film-forming      aliphatic polyurethane resin aqueous dispersion and the cross-linking      agent, and/or accelerators that may be present. </PAR><PAR>  One example of carrying out the improved method of this invention is      described below. Nails made of AISI C 1008 steel are cleaned within an      alkaline bath, rinsed, pickled within an acidic bath, rinsed, galvanized,      and rinsed. The nails are galvanized so as to comply with ASTM      Specification A641, Class 1, Type 2. Next, a chromate conversion layer is      applied to the nails. Thereafter, the thus treated nails are rinsed and      overcured. </PAR><PAR>  Next, these nails are collated into strips by means of adhesive tapes. The      collated nails are preheated within a preheating zone at a temperature      within a range of approximately 105.degree. F. to approximately      140.degree. F. The preheated strips are dipped into an aqueous coating      composition containing approximately 20 to approximately 23 percent by      weight of the aliphatic polyurethane resin (NeoRez XR-9637.TM.), based      upon the weight of the coating composition, to provide a dry coat      thickness of approximately 0.35 mil to approximately 0.55 mil. The coating      composition has a viscosity of approximately 34 to approximately 38      seconds, measured with a No. 1 Zahn cup. Air jets are used to remove any      excess coating composition and also to drive the coating composition into      regions covered by means of the collating tapes. </PAR><PAR>  The collated nails, as coated by means of the coating composition noted      above, are heated within a heating zone, by means of infrared lamps, to a      temperature of approximately 145.degree. F. to approximately 155.degree.      F. Residence time within the heating zone is approximately 15 seconds. A      tough, adherent coating is formed upon the nails during heating. </PAR><PAR>  Next, the collated nails are removed from the heating zone and are cooled      within a cooling zone by means of circulating air at room temperature.      Circulation is effected by means of blowers. The collated and cooled nails      are then packaged. </PAR><PAR>  Various modifications may also be made in the novel fastener provided by      this invention, or in the novel method provided by this invention, without      departing from the scope and spirit of this invention, as defined in the      appended claims. It is therefore to be understood that within the scope of      the appended claims, the present invention may be practiced otherwise than      as specifically described herein. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
