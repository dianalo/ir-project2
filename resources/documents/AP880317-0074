A Contra spokesman said the talks would be suspended unlessSandinistas halt the offensive against Contra forces in northernNicaragua.   ``Being certain that the Nicaraguan army invaded Honduras, mygovernment condemns it categorically and with firmness,'' Ariassaid Wednesday night.   ``I deplore that this happens shortly before the meeting begins,and it appears to me lamentable because Costa Rica feels that themanner of resolving problems is through direct dialogue and notthrough war,'' he told a news conference in San Jose.   The cease-fire talks were scheduled to take place in the town ofSapoa, near Nicaragua's border with Costa Rica. Arias won lastyear's Nobel Peace Prize for authoring the regional peace planunder which they are taking place.   Carlos Hurtado, an adviser to the Nicaraguan Resistance, theContra umbrella organization, told The Associated Press the talkswould be suspended if the offensive continued.   ``If the Sandinistas pursue this offensive with the intention ofdestroying our forces, it is possible that the Sapoa reunion willbe suspended,'' Hurtado said.   Arias said he had spoken by telephone Wednesday with PresidentsDaniel Ortega of Nicaragua, Vinicio Cerezo of Guatemala and JoseAzcona Hoyo of Honduras about the situation.   Ortega has said Sandinista troops pushed 2,000 Contras intoHonduras, but has not confirmed that troops entered the neighboringcountry.   ``After it cost us so much to have convened a reunion in Sapoa ... (Nicaragua) resorts to military action a few days beforerealizing (the talks) with the proposition of coming to thenegotiating table with a better position,'' Arias said.   ``We are putting in danger the much or the little that we haveachieved in the Central American peace process and the eyes of theworld are placed on the isthmus to find out what we are capableof,'' he added.   The peace plan calls for cease-fires in El Salvador, Guatemalaand Nicaragua, an end to outside support for the area'sinsurgencies, and negotiations aimed at installing democraticgovernments, among other points.   The plan was signed by Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador,Guatemala and Costa Rica.</TEXT></DOC>
