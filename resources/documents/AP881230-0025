Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Thursday thatspecialists hurried to inspect the plant near Yerevan, the capitalof Armenia, after the earthquake Dec. 7 that killed thousands ofpeople.   They concluded that the plant was not damaged but neededreinforcement against earthquakes ``within the shortest possibletime'' or it should be closed, Tass said.   The report follows an announcement by Soviet nuclear powerofficials last week that six nuclear power projects were scrappedbecause of earthquake danger or because of tougher standards. Newrules were imposed after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in April1986 killed at least 31 people.   Speculation abounded after the earthquake earlier this month thatthe plant near Yerevan was damaged. The facility lies near ageological fault.   Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov told reporters in Yerevan onDec. 12 that the plant would be shut in two years.   But the Tass story, quoting Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president ofthe Soviet Academy of Sciences, mentioned no deadline.   The facility generates more than one-third of the Caucasusmountain republic's electricity.</TEXT></DOC>
