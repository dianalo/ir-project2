(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A minister said Friday he would not takeclasses from his Christian school to see an Egyptian art exhibit atthe Mint Museum because its opening was used to promote paganism.   An exhibit of more than 70 artifacts from the time of the pharaohRameses II opened Oct. 1 at the art museum. Some 600,000 people areexpected to see the show through January.   The Rev. Joseph Chambers, chairman of Concerned Charlotteans andhead of the Paw Creek Christian Academy, said he felt the promotersof an opening ceremony for the exhibit showed ``insensitivity'' whenthey invited people to join in a ceremony in which ancient gods wereasked to appear and bless the exhibition.   Chambers stressed he was not opposed to the exhibit.   Museum director Milton Bloch said that while he respectedChambers' concerns, there was no need for an apology.   ``The Mint's pre-exhibition procession and promotion used someflowery phrases and theatrical fiction which it has turned out hasoffended some people in our community,'' he said. ``This result isentirely unintended.''</TEXT></DOC>
