The dollar closed at 132.85 yen, up 0.23 yen from Tuesday's132.62-yen closing. It opened at 132.68 yen and ranged from 132.60yen to 132.88 yen. The dollar now has gained 0.77 yen in threetrading days.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,a 250.56-point gainer the previous day, inched up another 6.87points, or 0.02 percent, closing at 33,256.45.   Selling to take profits in the afternoon erased most of theNikkei's gain in morning trading, dealers said.   ``The index started to weaken at midmorning, mainly becausethere was no market-affecting news to encourage buying today,''said Satoru Nagayoshi of New Japan Securities Co.   He said investors were hesitant to buy certain shares untilafter they have seen major U.S. economic indicators, including thenation's trade figures for February, due to be announced Friday inWashington.   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1 billionshares, down from Tuesday's 1.1 billion. Among the gainers weremachinery and construction issues.   In currency dealings, participants also generally remained onthe sidelines awaiting Friday's U.S. trade and wholesale priceindex figures, said Ichiro Ikeda of Chemical Bank in Tokyo.   The U.S. currency edged up shortly before the end of trading dueto position adjustments, he added.   ``Also, yen-selling to buy West German marks contributed to thedollar's rise against the yen,'' Ikeda said.   ``But investors' dollar-buying incentives won't be strong enoughto push the currency beyond the 133-yen level before the weekend atleast,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
