For American TV viewers, it was a striking image ofvictory, and of vindication for U.S. policy. But for manyArabs, on both sides of the conflict, the kiss captured asense of abject humiliation that they still are trying toshed. One year after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, thislingering air of defeat and destruction -- of lives,livelihoods, and pride -- shrouds Arab thinking about thecrisis. While renewed Middle East peace initiatives offerhope to U.S. strategists, in the Arab world, even America'sallies say they see few gains.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The only winners are the U.S. and Israel: there are noArab winners at all,&quot; says Saad Eddine Ibrahim, a politicalscientist at the American University of Cairo. &quot;The war hasdestroyed two Arab countries and divided the Arab worldwithout any redeeming outcome.&quot;   From the U.S. standpoint, the humbling of Iraq may havebeen a victory, yet for Arabs it has come at a horrificprice. Corpses still are being sifted from the Iraqi andKuwaiti sands; the body count, estimated at 100,000, is aboutdouble the dead in all the Arab-Israeli wars combined. Somefive million others were driven from their homes in thegreatest one-year exodus anywhere since the 1940s. Iraqisstill are fleeing en masse to Jordan. And the region's oilwealth, which once fueled Arab dreams of power andindependence, is so depleted that Kuwait and Saudi Arabia noware borrowers. The Gulf crisis, says former U.S. DefenseSecretary James Schlesinger, has turned &quot;a capital sourceinto a capital sink.&quot;   Often unwilling to come to grips with the realities ofwhat would have happened had America not intervened, Arabsnow dwell instead on a catalogue of deflated hopes. SaddamHussein is still in power, his deadly arsenal still largelyintact. Kuwait is free of occupiers, but still fettered to afeudal regime, albeit one that now is promising an electionnext year. And in Saudi Arabia, hopes for reform have faded.   &quot;There used to be a narrow margin for discussion. Now eventhat's closed,&quot; says a Saudi reporter who recently quitbecause of tightening censorship. The Gulf states also arereneging on promises to close the gap between Arab rich andArab poor. Even modest plans such as a Gulf defense force of50,000 Egyptians and Syrians -- &quot;an employment program inuniform,&quot; one diplomat calls it -- have been shelved.   Israel, meanwhile, brings new bargaining power, and newconditions, to peace negotiations. In the three monthsfollowing Kuwait's liberation, Israel earmarked more occupiedland for Jewish settlement than it did in all the precedingyear. The result, in Egypt, is anti-Israel sentimentunmatched since the 1982 Lebanon war. One newspaper evenblamed a recent outbreak of tomato blight on &quot;diseased&quot; seedsmaliciously exported by Israel.   For many Arabs, the feeling of hopes betrayed is soprofound that only conspiracy theories can explain whathappened. &quot;If you want my government's view, then I'll tellyou I put Saddam's picture on the wall and throw darts at itevery day,&quot; says Humaid Bin Drai, a senior official in theUnited Arab Emirates, a staunch U.S. ally. &quot;But my personalopinion is that this was a plan&quot; by Israel and its U.S.backers: &quot;Kuwait would be destroyed, and we'd have to sellour investments so Arabs would go back to riding camels.&quot;   For many Arabs, the losses already are being felt. Whatfollows are portraits of people whose lives have beenchanged, in some cases irrevocably, by the forces SaddamHussein unleashed a year ago.                                                                                                          The Youngsters                                                                                                          Last August, 17-year-old Shayma al-Obaydi hung a &quot;WelcomeHome&quot; sign made of tinsel and colored tacks on the wall ofher family's Baghdad home.   The sign was intended for her brother, Ra'ad, takenprisoner in 1982 during the Iran-Iraq war. In the wake ofSaddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait, Iran and Iraq releasedthousands of prisoners and the al-Obaydis anxiously awaitedthe return of their son.   A year later, Ra'ad still hasn't come home. Now hissister, Shayma, is gone, too.   In January, when the air war began, the al-Obaydisfortified one room to use as a makeshift bomb shelter. Butthe roar of planes and missiles alarmed Shayma, the family often's only daughter still living at home. So when a heavybarrage began on Feb. 13, she ran across the street to agovernment shelter, a concrete fortress with a chamber deepenough to muffle all sound. She was huddled there with herneighbors when two laser-guided missiles hit at 4:20 a.m.Soon afterward, the charred, smoking remains of 300 peoplewere lifted from the shelter in a grisly TV spectacle.Shayma's body was never found.   The bombs, launched at what the allies believed was acommand bunker, also blew out the glass on the ground floorof the al-Obaydis' home. Six months later, the windows gape:the cost of reglazing -- $300 -- is more than the family canafford. Before the war, Shayma's father, Fadil, worked as afireman at a refinery, since destroyed by allied bombs. Hehasn't sought other work, in part because his wife, Mahida,can't bear to stay home alone. &quot;What would I do without him?&quot;asks the stout, sad-eyed woman, clutching her husband's robe.So they spend each day driving aimlessly around Baghdad, tostay away from the house. &quot;Gasoline at least is cheap,&quot; saysFadil, who has $800 in savings left.   The al-Obaydis want to sell their house, to escape thememory of their missing children. But in post-war Iraq, fewpeople are in the market for new homes, much less onedirectly across from the bombed-out bunker, in a neighborhoodstill wreathed in black crepe. Two doors down from theal-Obaydis, a black banner records the names of a family ofnine killed in the bombing. An unpaid electricity bill isstuck in the gate, locked by the government when no one cameto claim the family's possessions.   The al-Obaydis have managed to sell their furniture, toraise cash and also to get rid of familiar trappings. Fadileven tore up his address book because Shayma, an organizedgirl with neat handwriting, had scribbled in all the numbers.Now, the couple sit on folding chairs in a living room thatis bare, except for a TV, and school photographs of Ra'ad andShayma, enlarged and colorized, and placed in huge frames.   In the picture, Shayma is a young woman with dark eyes andlong, lustrous hair. Ra'ad looks even younger. He was 16 whentaken prisoner and the family has had only simple letterssince, written on Red Cross stationery: &quot;I give my love to mybrothers and sisters. I hope to see you soon and don't worry,I'm fine.&quot; The return address is always Block 6, Building 10,Al Kutzrot.   The family has heard nothing for a year. Relations betweenIraq and Iran have soured, and the Red Cross has noinformation on Ra'ad. Many Iraqi prisoners joined in theMarch rebellion in Iraq's south, and were killed orimprisoned, though the al-Obaydis don't know if Ra'ad wasamong them.   Mahida has kept her son's bicycle, though she doubts hecould ride it anymore. &quot;He's 25,&quot; she says, smiling throughher tears. &quot;I imagine he's too big for it now.&quot;   In a back closet there is also a wardrobe, adorned withmagazine cutouts of the two pop stars Shayma adored: Madonnaand George Michael. Inside are a frilly party dress, schoolnotebooks, and an old doll. Her parents gave Shayma's otherthings away, but saved these few items, just in case.   &quot;Have you heard anything about the injured ones who weretaken to Jordan?&quot; Fadil asks. There is a rumor in theneighborhood, without basis, that some of those wounded inthe shelter bombing were whisked by ambulance to Amman.   Fadil, previously a non-observant Muslim, now goes to themosque daily, to pray for Shayma's return. He also sleepswith a picture of the Madonna and Child under his pillow, incase Christian prayer can help as well. The governmentoffered a free grave plot to families of victims whose bodiesweren't found, but the al-Obaydis declined.   &quot;If she is still in the shelter, then that is her grave,&quot;explains her brother, Moayid, 30, pointing at the collapsedconcrete and twisted metal across from the al-Obaydis' frontgate.   Two of the al-Obaydis' other sons served in -- andsurvived -- Kuwait, but one now is posted to Kurdistan, theother in the Shiite south. &quot;What if civil war breaks outagain?&quot; wonders Fadil. &quot;What if America bombs again? We havelost so much already.&quot;   Falling silent, he gazes blankly at the TV, which shows agroup of schoolgirls painting cardboard hearts and flowersfor the Iraqi president. In the background, a chorus sings:&quot;With our blood and with our soul we sacrifice ourselves foryou, oh Saddam.&quot;                                                                                                          The Breadwinner                                                                                                          Yousri Khier used to be the poor relation in his sprawlingCairo family, but on Aug. 2 he became its sole provider.   All three of his brothers and two of his brothers-in-lawworked in Kuwait for much better wages than the 32-year-oldhotel clerk makes in Cairo. But in August, they begantrickling home, one by one, jobless, their savings leftbehind and their possessions looted on the arduous trekthrough Iraq and Jordan.   All over Egypt, from the mud-hut farms of the Nile deltato the crowded apartment blocks of downtown Cairo, familiesof this already poor country, where unemployment ordinarilyhovers at close to 20%, have been further impoverished by thereturn of more than a million Egyptian workers. Together,these laborers, doctors, teachers or traders sent home $2.5billion in 1989. But last year, the families they hadsupported suddenly had to support them.   Yousri's 35-year-old brother, Gamal, squeezed into acollection of concrete huts on a Cairo rooftop already sharedby Yousri, his sister and her two sons. Gamal hoped his workabroad would earn enough to allow him to marry, but now heand his fiancee have had to shelve their plans.   Depressed, he wanders through the bare rooms, filling hisdays with chess, crossword puzzles, and worry. He has heardthat some Egyptians won't get their jobs back, especiallythose whose employers owed them money at the time of theinvasion. &quot;Not all Kuwaitis are good-hearted people,&quot; heconfides.   The apartment's only decoration is a faded photograph ofthe young men's father -- an illiterate peasant from southernEgypt who came to the city and eked out a living as ajanitor. Gamal, an accountant, is proud to have traveled sofar from his humble origins, but afraid now that his upwardclimb has stalled for good.   Clad in a loose peasant's robe instead of his habitualcoat and tie, he stares out a dusty window at Cairo'scrumbling buildings. &quot;Everything was so easy in Kuwait,&quot; hesays. &quot;You can't believe the food you could buy in theirsupermarkets.&quot; In the kitchen, his sister squats on thefloor, picking through a pile of limp okra that must somehowstretch to feed the family of a visiting sister whose husbandalso is back from Kuwait, unemployed.   As well as sharing his flat, Yousri also had to share hismeager salary, equivalent to about $100. His sister'shusband, a real estate broker in Kuwait, had to borrow $800from Yousri to support his family. Another brother-in-law,Jamaa Abdul-Fadil, managed to find a job for a few months asa sales assistant in a clothing store. But the yearly wagewas less than he made in a month as a legal clerk in Kuwait.   Racking his brain for something good out of the last year,Yousri reaches for his infant daughter, Ayatollah, whose namemeans &quot;reflection of God.&quot; &quot;At least I have seen her grow upthis year,&quot; he says of the 16-month-old. &quot;If it wasn't forSaddam Hussein, I wouldn't have had that.&quot;                                                                                                          The Peacemaker                                                                                                          On one side of Kaplan Street in Tel Aviv, a tiny writers'cafe called the Library provides a haven for Israel'sdwindling band of peace activists. Across the road, thebristling antennas of the Israeli Defense Ministry dominatethe skyline as hundreds of khaki-clad, teen-age conscriptsreport for work.   Yael Dayan, 52, has walked both sides of this street. Herlife has been split between making war and working for peace.She was 19 when she wrote a novel based on her service as anarmy conscript. Ten years later, as a military correspondentduring the Six Day War, she trailed Israeli troops across theSinai while her father, Moshe Dayan, led the army to swiftvictory. She is married to a retired general, and the youngerof her two children is serving in the army.   But these days, as she sips cappuccino in a dim corner ofthe Library, a steady stream of writers and activists sidleup to ask her advice about how to rescue Israeli publicopinion from its drift to the hawkish right.   Israel is the one Middle East country that has clearlystood to gain from the Gulf crisis. With Iraq crippled, theArab world sundered and the Palestine Liberation Organizationdiscredited by its support for Saddam Hussein, Israel facesfewer formidable enemies than at any time in its 43-yearexistence.   But not all Israelis feel like winners. Israeli doves likeMs. Dayan, who believe that Israel's long-term survivial canonly come through a negotiated peace, know that their task ismuch harder now.   Just two months before the August invasion, Ms. Dayanembarked on a joint peace mission with Faisal Husseini, aprominent Palestinian activist whose father, a militarycommander, died fighting the Israelis in 1948. The two touredthe U.S., arguing that their generation had to make the peacethat had eluded their parents.   A few months later, as Iraqi Scuds thundered into TelAviv, Ms. Dayan was back in uniform, serving in the reserves,while Mr. Husseini gave countless interviews trying toexplain why Palestinians danced on the rooftops as missileslanded.   The dancing, the sirens and the sealed rooms have shiftedthe peace debate from the rights of Palestinians to anargument about what best serves Israelis. Ms. Dayan reflectsthis change. The Palestinians, she says, &quot;are a tough enemywho will go on looking for whatever chance they have to sidewith destructive forces, but we can't replace them -- theyare the only people we have to talk to.&quot; As a result of thewar, she suggests, Israeli doves have stopped romanticizingthe Palestinians. She quotes her friend, the writer Amos Oz:&quot;We have to make peace, not love.&quot;   As Scuds landed close enough to make her house shake, Ms.Dayan continued calling her Palestinian acquaintances. &quot;I'dlike to say they called me: they didn't,&quot; she says, in adeep, almost masculine voice that comes unexpectedly from herfine-boned frame. &quot;But we had to keep a dialogue going evenif, at that time, we didn't have much to say to each other.&quot;   The peace movement too, she says -- all 115 of itsfractious splinter groups -- needs to start talking to thenew voters who will make the difference at the next election.She has tried approaching new Soviet immigrants, but found ittough going. &quot;You can get them to a meeting on mortgages,health or the status of women, but the West Bank, Gaza, Arabs-- they aren't interested yet.&quot;   But to Ms. Dayan, the issue is all the more urgent becauseof the Gulf War. For her, it marked a threatening shift inthe three-year Palestinian uprising, from the distance of theoccupied territories to the heart of Tel Aviv. Along with themissiles came a dramatic increase in incidents of violence byindividual Palestinians against Israeli civilians.   Now, Ms. Dayan feels, peace may yet come about &quot;forterrible reasons -- anything from racism to fear.&quot; Some wishthey could deport all Palestinians, or keep them underfull-time curfew, but ultimately they know that's impossible.&quot;People want a border,&quot; she says. &quot;Eventually they willrealize that they have to make territorial concessions to getit.&quot;                                                                                                          The Palestinians                                                                                                          In July last year, as Iraqi tanks massed on Kuwait'sborder, Bassam Abu Sharif sat at an oceanside Tunisrestaurant, hosting a lavish seafood lunch. Sipping vodka andlime, the Palestine Liberation Organization official wavedaway the idea that Iraq, the PLO's strongest armed ally,would invade Kuwait, its richest benefactor.   A year later, as a result of that invasion, the PLO standsstripped of both military and monetary might. In return forYasser Arafat's embrace of Saddam Hussein, the oil-rich Gulfstates have cut the PLO's funds.   At its Tunis headquarters these days, shrimp is off themenu. PLO largesse no longer covers fees for Mr. Abu Sharif'sson at the American School in London. &quot;For the first time inmy life, I have had to ask my family for money,&quot; he says.   Such economies don't engender much sympathy on theIsraeli-occupied West Bank, where Palestinians estimatepostwar unemployment among their people at 63%. At agathering of activists in East Jerusalem, a teacher speaksscathingly of a PLO official's behavior at a recent Mideastpeace seminar in Helsinki. &quot;They gave us lovely hotel rooms,&quot;she says. &quot;But he demanded a suite.&quot; The Palestinians shaketheir heads. The most recent accommodations for three of thefour people in the room have been cells in Israeli prisons.   Few Palestinians are willing to repudiate the PLO, which,in the absence of a state or a passport, remains their onlynational emblem. But criticism is much louder than everbefore. The newspaper Al Fajr last month excoriated the PLOfor trying to run the intifada, or uprising against Israelirule, &quot;by telephone and fax&quot; to keep local leadership fromdeveloping.   So many Arab states now are shunning Mr. Arafat that forthe first time in years, Israel isn't under any pressure toinclude the PLO in peace talks. Once, Mr. Arafat could counton a hero's welcome at the airport of almost every Arabcapital; kissing the PLO leader -- and paying him -- was anobligatory rite for Gulf leaders, ever anxious to appeasePalestinian commandos and appear as Arab patriots. Now, Mr.Arafat can be spurned, and his people persecuted or expelledfrom Gulf states, while his organization remains powerless torespond. &quot;We are causing no fear to anyone,&quot; says Ahmed Tibi,an activist in Jerusalem. &quot;Not even to cowards like theKuwaitis.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
