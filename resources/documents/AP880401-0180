The minutes of the February meeting of the Federal Open MarketCommittee confirmed comments Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan made to Congress on Feb. 23 that the Fed had eased itsgrip on credit in an effort to stimulate economic growth at thebeginning of the year.   Partly in response to that easing move, a variety of interestrates, including mortgage rates, fell by more than one-halfpercentage point. Major banks lowered their prime lending rate onFeb. 2 to 8.5 percent, the lowest level for this benchmark interestrate since mid-1986.   The minutes of the Feb. 9-10 meeting said the slight easing movewas taken because of concerns at the time about a slowdown inbusiness activity.   The Fed had moved immediately following the Oct. 19 collapse ofthe stock market to push interest rates lower in an effort to keepthe economy out of a recession. But then in December had beguntightening slightly out of fears that too much money in the economywould threaten higher inflation later in 1988.   The Fed minutes said the central bank believed it had room tolower interest rates further because the dollar's value hadstabilized on foreign exchange markets after falling sharply at theend of 1987.   The minutes said the slight easing occurred in late January andearly February, prior to the February meeting. At that meeting, Fedofficials decided to leave policy unchanged.   The Open Market Committee met again Tuesday and officials saidthey believed that the central bank once again decided to make nochanges to monetary policy in light of the fact that the economyhas been showing surprising strength in recent months.   The Labor Department reported Friday that the civilianunemployment rate fell to an eight-year low of 5.6 percent inMarch, down from 5.7 percent in February.   Greenspan, in recent comments, has said he doubts the joblessrate can fall much farther without threatening a round of renewedinflation.   Because of these statements, many economists believe the Fedwill not ease further for the rest of the year unless the economytakes an unexpected turn for the worse.   The committee minutes said that for the period before the Marchmeeting, the central bank would seek to ``maintain the slightlyreduced degree of pressure on (bank) reserve positions sought inrecent days.''   The Fed influences interest rates through its control over howmuch money banks have on hand. By increasing bank reserves, the Fedincreases the amount of money banks have to lend and thus drivesdown the cost of that money.   ``The members were in broad agreement that any substantialchange in policy, in either direction, was not warranted underprevailing economic and financial conditions,'' the minutes said.   The Fed decision was approved on an 11-0 vote. There is onevacancy on the Fed board.   The February meeting also sets monetary targets for the year andthe committee voted unanimously for growth targets of 4 percent to8 percent for two broader measures of the money supply known as M-2and M-3. These targets were revealed by Greenspan during hiscongressional testimony.   M-2 actually grew only 4 percent in 1987, substantially belowthe low point of the Fed's target of 5.5 percent growth for lastyear. That event had spurred some Reagan administration officialsto complain that the central bank was not doing enough to keep the5-year-old economic recovery alive.   However, after Greenspan publicly complained about pressure fromthe administration, the critics, including Beryl Sprinkel, chairmanof the president's Council of Economic Advisers have been silent inrecent weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
