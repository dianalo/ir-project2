But even if the candidates who stumped for those ideas are gone,Social Security will remain a hot issue in this presidential race,just as it was in 1984 and in the last three congressionalelections.   The likelihood is that it will also be a provocative topic in1992 and every four years after that for the foreseeable future.Too many Americans have too much at stake in Social Security for itto be otherwise.   ``This issue may be with us for the rest of our lives,'' saidPaul Maslin, pollster for Democratic candidate Paul Simon.   In the Iowa caucuses, the candidates most closely associatedwith calls for changes in Social Security, Republican Pete du Pontand Democrat Bruce Babbitt, took a shellacking.   Republican Pat Robertson, who like du Pont favors privatizingsome of Social Security, finished a strong second, but it was hisstand on moral issues, not pensions, that galvanized his Iowasupporters.   Du Pont, who contends the system will crash in the next centuryunder the weight of the retired baby boomers unless they areallowed to save their own retirement funds, finished a distantfifth.   Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, the Republicans' most vigorousdefender of the status quo in Social Security, was fourth, buthoping to move up in New Hampshire with his unbridled attacks onSen. Bob Dole and Vice President George Bush for supporting afreeze on Social Security in 1985.   Dole, on the other hand, is telling voters everywhere he goesabout his role on the National Commission on Social Security Reformin 1983, when the Kansas senator helped hammer out a last-minutecompromise that put Social Security back in the black.   ``You don't have to worry about it being broke. You don't haveto worry about getting your checks. And there I made adifference,'' says Dole, who never fails to add that Kemp votedagainst the Social Security rescue plan. The New York congressmansays he did so because of its increase in payroll taxes.   Kemp also argued that it was the improved economy and reducedunemployment that revived Social Security's fortunes.   Kemp's hard-hitting ad campaign against Dole and Bush on SocialSecurity has rekindled memories of the way Claude Pepper hammeredReagan and other Republicans for backing deep Social Security cutsin 1981.   Du Pont has accused Kemp of repeatedly misrepresenting his planto allow workers to set up tax-free savings accounts if theyrelinquish future Social Security benefit rights. Du Pont saysKemp's attacks ``remind me of the demagoguery practices by theDemocratic Party in the 1982 elections.''   Some Republicans, including Dole, have said it was theDemocrats' pounding on senior citizens' fear of Social Securitycuts or freezes that cost the GOP control of the Senate in 1986.   On the Democrats' side, Babbitt has called for ``a universalneeds test to discipline government programs,'' including SocialSecurity, and suggested making wealthier retirees pay income tax onall their benefits instead of half.   Gary Hart also has suggested taxing 85 percent of the benefits.   The other Democrats generally have been vowing to safeguardSocial Security and its COLA's.   ``We're going to keep it away from the Republican budget knivesforever,'' promises Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt.   Social Security's trust funds, which started 1988 with $67billion, are expected to swell to $104 billion by the start of 1989and to top $400 billion by 1994 and $1 trillion before the end ofthe decade.   Ultimately, Social Security's trust fund is expected to peak at$12 trillion _ $2.5 trillion in today's dollars _ around 2020, thenbe drawn down to nothing by 2050 to help pay the baby boomers'retirement.   Du Pont and Robertson have argued that even before the trustfunds are depleted, there will be nothing in there but governmentIOU's. To pay off those IOU's _ actually, interest-bearing Treasurybonds _ du Pont says, ``we face a big tax increase.''   When du Pont asked 80 people at a debate in Manchester, N.H.,how many thought Social Security would be there for them at 65,three people raised their hands.   More scientific polls have shown young workers remain dubiousabout their personal prospects for Social Security.   But that sentiment has not translated into support forpoliticians such as du Pont and Babbitt who suggest overhauling oreven tinkering with Social Security.   Maslin, the Simon pollster, said, ``The elites have attempted tomove the debate in a direction the voters don't want to move yet.''Young voters don't expect to get Social Security themselves, Maslinsaid, but they do expect it to be there for their parents.   ``For all of the provocation, the voters are still on the sideof protection,'' said Maslin. ``They understand that if thegovernment does not provide those benefits, they are going to haveto pay for their parents' retirement or health problems.''</TEXT></DOC>
