Taking this value as the upper limit of thepartial pressure of AsTe, they determined, on the basis of the thirdlaw of thermodynamics, the limiting values of the enthalpy of formationand the energy of atomization of AsTe. The requisite values of the entropyof gaseous AsTe and the enthalpy of formation of As/sub (g)/ and Te/sub(g)/ were taken. The calculated results referred to 298.15 K are given.The energy of atomization of the AsTe molecule estimated thus agreeswell with the value D{sub 298}{sup 0} (AsTe) = 307.2 kJ/mole calculatedby the Pauling's equation with allowance for the electronegativitiesof arsenic and tellurium.</TEXT></DOC>
