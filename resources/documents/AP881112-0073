Widespread corruption in Bolivia and the violence of the druglords in Colombia, along with greatly increased cultivation, haverendered U.S. State Department anti-drug programs in those countriesineffective, investigators for the General Accounting Office wrotein a report last week.   GAO did not examine the programs of the Drug Enforcement Agencyin Bolivia and Colombia.   Colombia is the world's largest producer of cocaine, which ismade from the coca leaf, and the source of 75 percent of the U.S.supply. Production capacity for 1987 was estimated by the Statedepartment at 143 tons. Bolivia is the second-ranking producer withcapacity of 99 tons.   State Department anti-drug expenditures in the two countries willhave totaled $106 million by the end of the current fiscal year,with current annual spending about $10 million in each country.Spending by the Drug Enforcement Agency and drug-related spending bythe Agency for International Development in both countries add $15.6million a year.   A voluntary coca eradication program wiped out 2,570 acres in1987 and early 1988, ``an all-time high for Bolivia,'' but anestimated 8,150 acres were brought under cultivation, making thetotal about 100,000 acres, the report said.   ``Bolivian narcotics interdiction efforts during 1987 were evenless impressive since only 2 percent of the coca paste produced inBolivia was seized, in addition to 148 kilograms (326 pounds) ofcocaine,'' the GAO report said.   Colombia has made a notable effort to combat coca cultivation andprocessing and has been the most cooperative of all Andean countriesbut was unable to prevent farmers from increasing coca area from38,300 acres in 1985 to 61,800 acres in 1987, GAO wrote.   Colombian eradication fell from 4,940 acres in 1985 to 1,140acres in 1987, though seizures of laboratories nearly doubled from725 to 1,360 in the same time.   The murders of judges, government ministers, police officers andeditors ``has made it extremely difficult for the government ofColombia to recruit qualified individuals to serve'' in police andjudicial offices, the report said.   U.S. expectations may ``exceed the realistically achievable goalsand the effect that a $10 million narcotics control program can haveon a well-established, multi-billion dollar industry'' in Colombia,the report said.   ``Narcotics corruption is viewed as the largest single problemaffecting U.S. narcotics control efforts in Bolivia. According toseveral U.S. and Bolivian officials, corruption exists within alllevels of the Bolivian government and very few government officialscan be trusted,'' GAO said.   The report said coca eradication efforts were bound to remainfutile until an effective herbicide is used in aerial sprayingprograms, as Colombia does with marijuana.</TEXT></DOC>
