No Israeli soldiers were hurt in the gunfight, the spokeman said.   The clash occurred late Tuesday, southeast of the Lebanesevillage of Barashit in the Israeli-controlled security zone insouthern Lebanon, the spokesman said. Barashit is about five milesfrom Israel's northern border.   ``The Israeli force noticed during a routine patrol that a squadwas moving southeast of Barashit,'' the military spokesman said,speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The force stormed the squadand one guerrilla was killed. Another escaped.''   The dead guerrilla was armed with hand grenades, submachine gunsand rocket-propelled grenades, the army spokesman said.
