(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Kristina B. SullivanandM;A common denominator among high-end integrated software packages is theinclusion of a programming-language facility.andP;  What differs, however, is theapproach.andM;The programming languages featured in some integrated packages reflect theniche market for which they were designed.andP;  RS/1 from BBN Software ProductsCorp., for example, includes statistical-programming capabilities that appealto the technical data-analysis market it targets.andP;  SAS Institute Inc.'s SASSystem, meanwhile, offers linear and statistical programming forengineering-analysis applications.andM;Others have a more general appeal.andP;  Ashton-Tate's Framework includes FRED, aprogramming language that gives users full control over the user interface,according to Pat Pitkin, product manager for Framework at the Torrance,Calif., firm.andM;Lotus Development Corp., of Cambridge, Mass., bills the programming languagein its Symphony package as an extension of the macro capabilities in Lotus1-2-3, according to Tim McManus, director of marketing for Lotus Symphony.andO;&quot;People first become comfortable with building macros and then move toadvanced capabilities,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If the syntax is similar, it's an easylearning step.&quot;andM;Some programming languages go out of their way to accommodate the noviceuser.andP;  For example, Alis, an office-automation package from Applix Inc. thatincludes word-processing, spreadsheet, graphics, database and work-groupcalendar modules, starts users off in a learn mode that simply recordskeystrokes.andP;  Conditional statements can be added to create a moresophisticated application, according to Becky Willis, director of productmarketing for the firm.andM;Programming tools give users the ability to customize applications, providemenu systems and automate routine tasks.andP;  Unlike macro features, which recordkeystrokes, they allow users to incorporate variables and conditions.andM;For many users, a programming language is crucial to the purchase ofintegrated software.andP;  At the Food and Drug Administration in Rockville, Md.,andO;for example, the programming language in the SAS System is used to createstatistical-analysis applications, according to Jonathan Cook, an operationsresearch analyst with the department.andM;Programming tools are often used to simplify complex routines in anintegrated system.andP;  ARCO Oil andamp; Gas Co. in Dallas, for example, uses theExtended Language Facility (ELF) in Alis to create intuitive applications,said Okey Bess, supervisor of drilling engineering systems.andP;  &quot;ELF allows usto automate a lot of processes that normally someone would have to remember,&quot;he said.andM;As the integrated-software market has matured, the programming languageswithin these packages have become more robust.andP;  Examples include theprogramming capabilities in Enable Software Inc.'s Enable/OA, which nowoffers a menu generator, a field painter, a debugger and procedural languagecommands.andP;  In Open Access III, from Software Products International Inc., aninterface to C routines, a compiler and a subset of the Structured QueryLanguage (SQL) are part of the programming tools.andM;Informix Software Inc.'s SmartWareII, which is available now for DOS andexpected in early 1991 for OS/2 Presentation Manager, features a uniqueprogramming tool that gives users the ability to connect to an SQL NetWare386 or Unix server and download information into the integrated package.andO;Positioned as a central component for processing data on a LAN, SmartWareIIalso offers direct links to other software packages such as Lotus 1-2-3 andAshton-Tate's dBASE IV.andM;Unlike most of the programming languages found in integrated packages, theone in KnowledgeMan/2 version 2.6 provides links to all of Microsoft Corp.'slanguages, including C and COBOL.andP;  &quot;Users can integrate C and other routinesvery easily into KnowledgeMan/2 applications,&quot; said Ken Jones, vice presidentof sales for Micro Data Base Systems Inc., the developer of the package.andM;KnowledgeMan/2's built-in debugger is a programming tool users appreciate.andO;&quot;If the program you're working on has many paths of logic, you can turn thedebugger on.andP;  It shows programming statements in a corner of the screen whilethe program is executed,&quot; said John Urbaniak, president of Peregrine SystemsInc., a software developer in Pittsburgh.andM;Conventional wisdom holds that integrated software has no place inmultitasking environments.andM;That theory is wearing thin, however, as integrated-software vendors arefinding the opposite to be true: Customers are looking for upgrades thatsupport OS/2, Unix and other multitasking environments.andM;While integrated software commonly provides data interchange and a consistentuser interface among its modules, emerging multitasking operating systems addconcurrent processing and linking among applications.andM;Hewlett-Packard Co.'s NewWave graphical operating system, for example, allowsusers to create dynamic links between data and applications, to view datafrom one application while working in another, and to directly manipulateprograms and data through icons.andM;Many people believe &quot;that multitasking operating systems give you integrationfor free, but that's clearly not true,&quot; explained Tim McManus, director ofmarketing for Symphony at Lotus Development Corp., based in Cambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;It's up to the application itself to take advantage of the [integration]capabilities,&quot; he added.andM;Many integrated-software developers are currently gearing up to meet thedemand they foresee for their programs under OS/2 Presentation Manager (PM)and Unix.andM;Applix Inc., for example, has already released Unix and VMS versions of itsAlis software.andP;  Micro Data Base Systems Inc., meanwhile, has also taken astep in that direction by including an OS/2 PM graphics module in itsKnowledgeMan/2 package.andM;In addition, Enable Software Inc. and Software Trust are preparing OS/2 PMand Unix versions of their products, and SAS Institute Inc. plans to releaseits SAS System under OS/2 PM, according to officials from those firms.andP;
