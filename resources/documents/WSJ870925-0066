In Kansas, Mayfield State Bank and Murdock State Bank were closed after &quot;massive losses in both banks' securities accounts completely destroyed&quot; the banks' capital reserves, said Kansas Bank Commissioner Newton Male. The banks, located 40 miles apart in Mayfield and Murdock, Kan., had common owners and management.    In Oklahoma, state authorities closed Citizens Bank in Drumright, Okla. Its only office, with $30.6 million in deposits in 3,800 accounts, was to reopen today as a branch of American National Bank of Bristow, Okla. American National will purchase $29.2 million of the failed bank's assets; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. will retain about $4.2 million of Citizens Bank's troubled assets. It was the 27th bank to fail in Oklahoma this year.    The FDIC said the Mayfield, Kan., bank's only office, with deposits of $20.3 million in 1,100 accounts, was to reopen today as a branch of First National Bank in Harper, Kan. The Murdock bank's only office, with deposits of $22.1 million in 1,300 accounts, was to reopen as a branch of Farmers State Bank of Norwich, Kan.    When it was closed, the Mayfield bank had assets of $19 million and the Murdock bank had assets of $20.7 million.    The two banks had engaged in speculative trading in so-called &quot;buy back&quot; or &quot;pair-off&quot; arrangements that went sour when the market fell recently. According to Michael Heitman, deputy bank commissioner of Kansas, the banks' principal owner and chief executive officer, Bradley Noll, had entered into the transactions with numerous out-of-state brokers.    Under the arrangements, the banks committed to purchase principally long-term government bonds without committing any funds, planning to reverse the transaction before settlement date and sell at a profit. With a falling market, however, the banks became liable for the purchase of large amounts of securities that carried market losses. The banks used repurchase agreements and high-cost brokered deposits to fund the purchases, but state banking officials found the losses not only depleted the banks' capital but gave them a $4 million capital deficit. </TEXT></DOC>
