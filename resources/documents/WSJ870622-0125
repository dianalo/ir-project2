The funds are American Heritage Fund, Industry Fund of America, Steadman American Industry Fund, Steadman Associated Fund, and ISI Income Fund. The two Steadman entries are sister funds, as are American Heritage and Industry Fund of America.    In tallies by Lipper Analytical Services Corp., those five funds ranked in the bottom 25 for each of three periods: one year, five years, and 10 years ended March 31. The one-year rankings cover 997 funds, the five-year rankings, 513; and the 10-year rankings, 392.    A look at these funds shows varying reasons for the poor performance. Problems have ranged from failed attempts at market timing to excessive caution. Most of the funds also have high expense ratios, due in part to their small size. Three of the five have recently changed managers; the new brooms promise, of course, to sweep clean.    In the five years ended March 31, a period that roughly coincides with one of the most powerful bull markets in history, American Heritage Fund's asset value shrunk 14%. Industry Fund of America eked out a microscopic gain of 0.5%. Meanwhile, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index (with dividends reinvested) was up 224%.    Both funds were run until December 1985 by Jefferson Bender of Menlo Management in Cupertino, Calif. Mr. Bender says that &quot;it's relatively expensive to run a smaller fund&quot; because &quot;expenses such as audit, legal, and printing costs eat into the gains from trading.&quot; But he hangs up the phone rather than answer questions about his investment techniques. He says the fund did enjoy periods of success under his decade-long stewardship, but can't specify when they were. &quot;The records are all put away,&quot; he says. &quot;I have very little interest in it now.&quot;    Richard K. Parker, an associate director of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., is the new portfolio manager. With Henry Krauss, a senior vice president at Westminster Securities Corp., he formed American Heritage Management Corp. to take over the two funds, and won a shareholder vote in late 1985. (Neither Bear Stearns nor Westminster plays any part in management.)    Mr. Parker hasn't been too successful either, so far. In the 12 months ended March 31, American Heritage declined 16% while the Sandamp;P 500 rose 26%. &quot;You have to realize what kind of cobwebs there were,&quot; Mr. Parker says. &quot;The (fund's SEC) registration had lapsed four to five years prior . . . (The fund) was in terrible shape.&quot; He says it took new management a few months to assess the situation and realign the portfolio.    The Steadman American Industry Fund showed an average compound annual gain of about 0.6% for the five years ended in March. Steadman Associated Fund did better -- about 11% a year -- but still fell far short of the 26% annual gain of the Sandamp;P 500.    Both funds are managed by Steadman Security Corp., whose chief executive officer, Charles Steadman, battled the SEC in court from 1971 to 1982. In 1977, the SEC tried to bar Mr. Steadman from the investment-management business, charging that he hadn't adequately disclosed his company's compensation from the funds and his personal borrowings from banks where fund money was on deposit. The SEC backed down after Mr. Steadman won a partial victory in court against the agency. Ultimately the SEC imposed only a 180-day suspension, which it then waived.    Mr. Steadman says he and his portfolio managers made two major mistakes over the years -- trying to jump in and out of the stock market (with bad timing, as it turned out), and emphasizing individual stock picks instead of industries. He adds that holdings were recently realigned: &quot;We've worked awfully hard to get these portfolios into a pleasing posture, and we're getting closer all the time.&quot;    Lipper Analytical Services says expenses run to 2.8% of assets annually at Steadman Associated Fund and 5.8% at Steadman American Industry Fund. &quot;Expense ratios are a function of size and our funds are small,&quot; Mr. Steadman notes. Still, the Steadman ratios are far above the average expense ratio, which is less than 1% at large funds, and about 1.5% at funds with assets under $25 million, according to Lipper's figures. It's also worth noting that the two funds weren't always small. Between them, they had about $111 million in assets back in 1972, compared with about $24 million recently.    The ISI Income Fund, one of three funds formerly run by ISI Corp., showed gains of 9.7% a year during the five-year span. Richard Whelpley, portfolio manager from the early 1970s until 1986, couldn't be reached for comment. Others in the money-management field say he expected high inflation and rising interest rates, and accordingly kept much of ISI's portfolios in Treasury bills.    In 1986, after suffering from health problems, he sold ISI Corp. for about $3 million to Douglas Adams. Mr. Adams is described in several pending lawsuits as a business associate of John Peter Galanis, who was recently charged by the federal government with peddling fraudulent tax shelters. In September, the fund's board discharged ISI Corp. and hired Sigma Management Inc. of Wilmington, Del., which runs seven mutual funds of its own.    Richard V. King, president of Sigma, says, &quot;You won't see the ISI funds on the (bottom 25 list) for long.&quot; But the performance so far is hardly sizzling. From Jan. 1 through June 4, ISI Income Fund, now invested mostly in Ginnie Maes, declined 4.7%. </TEXT></DOC>
