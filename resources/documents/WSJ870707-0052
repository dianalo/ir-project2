It is understood that the commission has written to the firms requesting trading information for as many as three dozen people. &quot;The (commission) is casting a pretty wide net in the hope that they can catch someone with their hand in the cookie jar,&quot; said an official of a large Canadian insurance company.    Commission officials wouldn't say what prompted the investigation.    The commission also is drawing up regulations to implement new laws that greatly broaden the definition of insider trading and impose harsher penalties.    The new laws won't affect targets of the current investigation because they aren't officially in force yet, but they illustrate the growing concern of Canadian authorities over insider trading.    &quot;There have been hardly any insider-trading cases prosecuted in Canada,&quot; said James Turner, a commission lawyer.    Maximum penalties under the new law include two years in prison and a fine of as much as one million Canadian dollars ($754,100) or three times the profits from insider trading, whichever is higher. The current maximum is one year in prison and fines of as much as 25,000 dollars for a corporation and 2,000 dollars for an individual.    The new law also expands liability for insider trading to include most people who knowingly trade on inside information. In a takeover situation, Mr. Turner said current law provides &quot;technical arguments&quot; against convicting insider traders unless they are officials of the company making the acquisition.    The new law was passed by the Parliament in Ontario, home of Canada's major securities markets, earlier this year and is expected to take effect after the commission draws up the new regulations, probably late this summer.    The tougher stance in Canada follows a crackdown on insider trading in the U.S. in which a number of traders have been indicted or convicted. One major trader, Ivan F. Boesky, has pleaded guilty in the case and has cooperated with the government.    The Ontario commission hasn't successfully prosecuted anyone for insider trading since 1983, when Come Carbonneau, former president of Falconbridge Copper Corp. was fined 150 dollars for making a profit of about 3,000 dollars on the sale of about 2,000 Falconbridge shares. Mr. Carbonneau bought the shares before the company's release of favorable drilling results.    In March 1986, the commission began investing the sharp run-up in the stock price of Genstar Corp. before a takeover bid from Imasco Ltd. Mr. Turner said the commission is continuing its probe of the Genstar takeover.    Several executives with Canadian securities firms wouldn't comment about the commission's latest request for stock market trading records. The commission said in a statement Friday that it is &quot;improper for any person to disclose that a request&quot; for trading information has been made.    Sources said the commission began its investigation three or four months ago and the inquiry is expected to take several more months to complete. Besides insider trading, the commission is investigating &quot;front-running&quot; and other alleged improper trading activities.    Front-running occurs when a securities trader knows that an institution is about to make a large stock purchase and buys a small number of shares ahead of the institution. The institutional purchase usually drives up the stock's price and the trader makes a small profit selling the shares to the institution.    Several Canadian investment analysts said front-running can become a problem because of the relatively thin trading activity on Canadian exchanges. &quot;Institutions sometimes have to bid up a stock by (one dollar) to get a block (trade) done,&quot; one source said. &quot;There's a lot of room in the middle to make money if you know an institution is trying to put a block together.&quot;    But sources said the commission is unlikely to find a major insider trading scandal in Canada. &quot;There just isn't any giant arbitrage business up here,&quot; a vice president of one securities firm said. &quot;In Canadian takeovers, almost all the arbitrage business we do is for U.S. customers.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
