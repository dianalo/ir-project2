These includecurbs on capital-movement by international investors, such asthe existing three-month freeze on short-term bank depositsbefore withdrawal is allowed.   Analysts expect the removal of the three-month rule toattract more funds to the Irish market. The decontrol couldhelp narrow interest-rate differentials with other nations inthe European Monetary System.   At the end of 1992, Ireland will lift all remainingcapital restrictions, involving limits on Irish residents'deposits overseas and on their foreign-currency accounts inIreland.   Ireland and Spain were given until the end of 1992 to liftcapital controls under the EC's liberalization agreement,designed to eliminate barriers to EC-wide bank accounts andlending. Portugal and Greece were given longer, while theother EC members have already lifted controls.                                                                                                          CZECHOSLOVAKIA OPENS UP MEDIA                                                                                                          Czechoslovak lawmakers voted to end the state broadcastingmonopoly and permit private television and radio stations.Stations will be operated under licenses to be issued by thenew Federal Council for Radio and Television Broadcasting.The measure approved by Parliament limits commercials to 10%of daily broadcast time for private TV stations and 20% forradio stations, compared with 3% and 5%, respectively, forstate-owned media. The legislation permits alcohol andcigarette commercials.                                                                                                          MEXICO POLL ON TRADE PLAN                                                                                                          Nearly half of Mexican industrialists believe the proposedNorth American free-trade pact would hurt the country'sindustrial development, a poll found. In the National Chamberof Commerce of Industries survey, 48% of members respondingsaid the treaty being negotiated by Mexico, the U.S. andCanada would bring in competition that could hurt their ownbusinesses, given Mexican banks' tight lending policies andhigh interest rates. And 29% of the 100 respondents, who runsmall, medium-sized and large operations, said they couldn'tsurvive the competition, though nearly all of them wantedmore information on the plan.                                                                                                          BULGARIA HIT BY ENERGY SHORTAGE                                                                                                          Bulgaria said a sudden cutoff of Soviet energy supplieshas caused a serious power crunch and delivered a blow to thecountry's deteriorating economy. Moscow gave Sofia only threehours notice Tuesday before cutting off electricity supplies,leading authorities to ration electricity in major cities.Earlier this month, the Soviet Union halted until year endsupplies of coal to Sofia. Moscow attributed the latestcutoff to a broken electricity grid in Moldavia, and saidsupplies to Bulgaria wouldn't resume until at least Saturday.                                                                                                          FINANCIAL STRIKE IN GHANA                                                                                                          A banking and insurance strike in Ghana continued for asecond day, despite the government's vow to deny negotiationsunless the stoppage ends. The walkout, led by the Associationof Financial Institutions, involves the central bank,commercial banks, insurers, and national social security andinsurance agencies. The strikers want an end to thegovernment's final authority over their working conditions.                                                                                                          SOVIET OIL AGENCY GOES PRIVATE                                                                                                          The Soviet Union's oil exporting agency, Soyuznefteexport,has declared itself a private enterprise and been renamedNafta Moskva, or Moscow Oil.   The exporter, one of the world's largest, said yesterdaythat its employees voted Oct. 23 to make it independent ofthe government and form a stock company, with workers as theonly shareholders. It asked Russian President Boris Yeltsinto confirm its new status.   Mr. Yeltsin, in the reorganization of the Sovietgovernment and economy following the failed August coup,decreed that all national government ministries would betransferred to Russian republic jurisdiction tomorrow.   The U.S.S.R. is the world's leading oil producer, butoutput has dropped in recent years because equipment isoutmoded and all decisions, from production quotas to prices,were made by Moscow bureaucrats. Moscow Oil said itsprivatization would allow more operational flexibility andspeed.
