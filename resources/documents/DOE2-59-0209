Research and development activitieson various aspects of these control technologies were reported by participantsduring the Symposium. Of particular interest was the development of F{sub1} sterility as a practical method of controlling pest Lepidoptera. Geneticmethods of insects control are applicable only on an area wide basis.They are species specific and thus do not reduce populations of beneficialinsects or cause other environmental problems. Further, the problem ofthe target species becoming resistant to the control technology is avoidedwith genetic methods of insect control. Other papers presented reportedon the potential use of radiation as a quarantine treatment for commoditiesin international trade and the use of radioisotopes as ``tags'' in studyinginsects. The Symposium was attended by 70 participants from 34 countriesand four international organizations. Forty-eight papers were presentedand are included in these Proceedings.</TEXT></DOC>
