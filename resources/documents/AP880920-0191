New violence hit the disputed territory over the weekend, withone man said to have been killed and at least 25 people officiallyreported injured.   The Armenian activist, Rafael Popoyan, said many residents inthe Armenian capital who struck last Friday remained off the jobTuesday, vowing to stay out until the Armenian Supreme Soviet, orparliament, met in new session to reconsider their annexation plea.   In a telephone interview from Yerevan on Tuesday, Popoyan saidmembers of the Karabakh Committee, a group pressing for annexationof Nagorno-Karabakh, told the Yerevan crowd that one-third, or 115members, of the republic's Supreme Soviet signed a request for anew session.   ``At 10 o'clock tomorrow morning, people will be on the squarewaiting for an official announcement,'' Popoyan said. He said thataccording to law, the session must be held if one-third of theSupreme Soviet members request it.   Popoyan said committee members also told the crowd that a curfewwas in effect in Stepanakert, the main city of Nagorno-Karabakh.Popoyan, a 46-year-old former political prisoner, said he had nodetails.   The predominantly Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh, amountainous region of the republic of Azerbaijan, began agitatingin February for annexation to Armenia. Ethnic riots broke out inSumgait, an industrial city of Azerbaijan, at the end of February,that left at least 32 people dead.   The area, in the southern Soviet region near the Turkish-Iranianborder, has been tense since then. According to the official Tassnews agency, Armenians and Azerbaijanis traded shots Sunday inKhadzhaly village in Nagorno-Karabakh.   An editor at the official news agency Azerinform in Azerbaijansaid in a telephone interview that a 61-year-old carpenter injuredin the clash died Monday in a hospital. The editor, who spoke oncondition of anonymity, said he did not know whether the man was anArmenian or an Azerbaijani.   Tass said 25 people were hurt in the fighting, but Popoyan saidreports in Yerevan reported up to 70 injured.   Popoyan and Dmitri Volchek, an editor of the unofficial Moscowjournal Glasnost, said a bomb exploded Monday at a dormitoryhousing Armenian construction workers in Abovyan, a few miles fromStepanakert.   Popoyan said no one was hurt. He said a leaflet found at thesite called the blast a ``present to residents of Karabakh.''   Calls did not go through to Stepanakert. Operators said thetelephone line was down.   In a possible prelude to greater police activity in Armenia andAzerbaijan, Tass called for order. ``The people are demanding thatlaw and order be enforced everywhere. Law-enforcement servicesalong with the public are taking necessary measures,'' it said.   Officials in Yerevan said police patrols were increased, butPopoyan said police made no effort to break up the meeting Tuesdaynight.   The Armenian parliament in June asked the national SupremeSoviet to permit Armenia to annex Nagorno-Karabakh. The centralgovernment rejected that demand and offered instead a plan ofsocial and economic development.   Tass said many workers were showing restraint, ensuring normaloperation of farms, transportation and factories, ``but all thesame, irresponsible elements, first of all in the Nagorno-Karabakhautonomous region, continue working up tension, provoking disordersand resorting to arson and other illegal activities.''   Popoyan said stores, farms, food processing plants andtransportation were operating in Yerevan, but many otherenterprises and schools were closed.   He estimated that 1 million people attended a Monday nightgathering in Yerevan. A duty officer at the Armenian Ministry ofInternal Affairs said more than 250,000 people attended.   Tass said several meetings were held in Azerbaijan as well.   A new strike was called last week in Stepanakert, where workerswere off their jobs for weeks during the summer.   In Baku on Tuesday, the Azerbaijani Communist Party chief,Abdul-Rahman Vezirov, told a meeting of local officials the clasheswere part of ``anti-social activities'' that must be combated withwork among the people and stricter control over law-and-order, Tassreported.   Armenians are predominantly Christian; most Azerbaijanis areShiite Moslem. Armenians also differ linguistically and culturallyfrom ethnic Azerbaijanis.</TEXT></DOC>
