Early yesterday, Eduard Shevardnadze resigned his positionas Soviet Foreign Minister and warned that &quot;dictatorship wascoming&quot; to the Soviet Union. His departure is seen creatingmore problems for Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The hint of anarchy is very unnerving to the bondmarket,&quot; said David McClean, a proprietary trader at CreditLyonnais Securities USA, a unit of the big French bank.   Erick Muller, bond market economist at Credit Commercialde France, said the Shevardnadze resignation brought theSoviet Union's problems to the forefront and &quot;showed{investors} what a big problem the U.S.S.R. can become.&quot;   Analysts worry that should the Soviet Union disintegrateinto chaos, others countries in Europe -- especially Germany-- could be faced with a flood of refugees. To finance thepotentially enormous cost of absorbing the refugees, alongwith other costs associated with helping to stabilize theSoviet Union, European governments will be forced to borrowenormous amounts of money in the credit markets. Suchborrowing, in turn, would put upward pressure on Europeaninterest rates.   Even before the Shevardnadze resignation hit the newswires, bond market sentiment in Europe was bearish due tospeculation that the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, maysoon raise interest rates another notch in an effort to wringout inflation. In turn, that could force other Europeancountries, such as France, to raise rates also.   Klaus Baader, a bond market analyst with UBS Phillips andamp;Drew in London, said that while political uncertainty in theSoviet Union &quot;is bad news for bonds all around&quot; the world,it's particularly bad for Germany because German banks havelent the Soviet Union billions of marks, all of which areguaranteed by the Bonn government. The latest loan, for 1.2billion marks ($811.9 million), was signed Tuesday.   In addition, trade with the Soviet Union remains importantfor industries in eastern Germany. &quot;If you take away thatlast bit of demand for eastern German industry, it's going tomake the adjustment process that much more difficult.&quot;   In trading yesterday, bonds issued by Germany and Francewere hardest hit of the major government bond markets,followed by Britain and the U.S.   Germany's benchmark 10-year government bond, or bund, fellnearly one point to a price of 100.3 to yield 8.83%. France's8.5% 10-year bond also fell nearly a point to 91.32 to yield9.99% while the 8.5% 30-year bond fell 1 7/8 points to 85.65to yield 10.04%.   In Britain, the benchmark 11.75% gilt due 2003/2007 wasquoted at 106 27/32, down 26/32 from late Wednesday to yield10.72%.   Meanwhile, First Chicago Corp. said its First NationalBank of Chicago subsidiary lowered its prime, or base lendingrate, to 9.5% from 10%. American National Bank andamp; Trust Co. ofChicago, also a First Chicago unit, was the only other bankto follow suit. On Wednesday, several regional banks loweredthe prime rate, although no major money center bank has yetdone so.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Prices of U.S. Treasury securities followed the Europeanmarkets yesterday, posting modest losses on news of Mr.Shevardnadze's resignation.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended 5/8 pointlower, a decline of $6.25 for a bond with a $1,000 faceamount. The issue's yield, which moves in the oppositedirection of its price, rose to 8.23% from 8.17% onWednesday.   Rates on Treasury bills were modestly lower. The discountrate on three-month bills ended at 6.55% for abond-equivalent yield of 6.73%, down from Wednesday when thediscount rate ended at 6.59% to yield 6.77%.   Yesterday's loss followed even sharper declines onWednesday, when investors sold bonds in an effort to captureprofits as the year end approaches.   But trading activity has been light because many investorshave moved to the sidelines, where they will remain until thenew year begins.   Market players &quot;want no risk, and any political turmoilthat may take place outside or even in the domestic marketwill have a magnified impact,&quot; said Maria Ramirez, who headsMaria Ramirez Capital Consultants Inc.   Recent declines in interest rates and news of politicalstrife in the Middle East and Soviet Union has promptedinvestors to &quot;assume the opportunity to take profits, to lockin profits before they totally evaporate,&quot; said Ms. Ramirez.At this juncture, &quot;there's no reason to take risk.&quot;                                                                                                          Corporate Bonds                                                                                                          Most investment-grade corporate bonds ended 1/4 pointlower. In the junk bond market, prices of speculative-gradebonds, or securities with low credit ratings or no creditratings at all, finished little changed.   There were no new issues.                                                                                                          Municipal Securities                                                                                                          Municipal bonds ended steady to 1/4 point lower.   In ratings action, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. placed thetriple-B rating of the Philadelphia International Airport'sairport revenue bonds on its Credit-Watch surveillance listwith negative implications.   According to Sandamp;P, the action reflects &quot;the city'sinability to access the note market,&quot; and possiblerepercussions relating to the airport's capital funds.   The bonds are rated B-a by Moody's Investors Service Inc.   A total of $154 million of outstanding debt is affected bythe action. Philadelphia traders report that the bonds wereunaffected by the news and continue to trade at yields in the9% range, similar to those of the city's general obligationbonds.   In secondary trading, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority's7.20% securities of 2018 were 1/4 lower at 98 7/8 to yield7.27%.                                                                                                          Mortgage-, Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage securities ended with losses of 6/32 to 8/32.
