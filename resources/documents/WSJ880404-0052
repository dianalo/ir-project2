Perry, Staff Reporter of The Wall street Journal </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> APPLETON, Wis.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush, coasting now to the Republican presidential nomination, doesn't always get the little things right. In a speech here at Lawrence University, he said the federal government should lend a hand &quot;so you can afford to send your college to children.&quot;    Mr. Maladroit he may be -- an earnest, dogged, not-always-exciting candidate -- but so far, to the despair of his critics, he and his campaign staff have managed to get most of the big things right.    He is the survivor -- the man who defeated Jack Kemp, the candidate of ideas; Robert Dole, the candidate who gets things done; and Pat Robertson, the commander of a great evangelical army.    &quot;George Bush's secret,&quot; says Donald Devine, a former senior consultant to Sen. Dole, &quot;is his ability to discipline himself enough to stay out of day-to-day operations, delegating those responsibilities to people who are reasonably competent.&quot;    That's part of it. He does know how to run things. He is clever enough to hang on tightly to President Reagan, and thereby convince hard-core Reaganites he is the president's logical heir. He is also probably better at what he does than most people give him credit for.    That's enough to get him this far. But now, many think, the heavy work begins.    &quot;George Bush and the people around him have yet to be really tested,&quot; says David Keene, another former senior consultant to Sen. Dole (both Mr. Keene and Mr. Devine were fired in the final implosion of the Dole campaign). &quot;Bush didn't really win the nomination so much as his opposition collapsed and gave it to him.&quot;    First there is the question of personality. In his new stump speech, Mr. Bush even jokes about it. &quot;It's important,&quot; he says, for &quot;a vice president not to upstage his boss. How difficult it's been for me the last seven years to keep my charisma in check.&quot;    Mr. Bush is working earnestly and doggedly to loosen up. He admits he gets a little tired. Campaigning, he says, is exhausting. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he jokes, &quot;I feel like the javelin competitor who won the toss and elected to receive.&quot;    George Bush telling stories is no Ronald Reagan. But he's trying.    Then too, the Reagan connection, which has been important in winning the fight for the party nomination, may be more of a liability than an asset in winning the election.    The hecklers already are beginning to swarm around Mr. Bush's campaign rallies. In Madison, a liberal citadel, protestors chanted &quot;Wimpeach!&quot; -- meaning that the vice president, sometimes called &quot;a wimp,&quot; should be impeached for some of the things that have occurred in the past seven years. &quot;Bush Sells Crack,&quot; some of the signs proclaimed, referring to the administration's previous support of Panama strongman -- and indicted drug peddler -- Gen. Manuel Noriega.    In Eau Claire, hecklers chanted, &quot;Just say no to Bush.&quot;    And everywhere Mr. Bush traveled last week, reporters demanded to know if the vice president believes Attorney General Edwin Meese should step down. Typically, Mr. Bush brushed the question aside by saying he needed to know more about why two of Mr. Meese's top aides resigned.    Mr. Bush, hardly a subtle man, tries to have it both ways. He loyally defends the Reagan administration, but more and more begins to suggest a Bush administration might play things differently. Thus, he says, in his administration &quot;I want to hold ethical standards so high there's no perception of wrongdoing.&quot; He doesn't say he'd clean house, but he does say he would have an entirely new cabinet.    He talks about spending more for education and fighting the drug problem and he deplores the huge budget deficits. But he doesn't give himself much room to maneuver -- because he says he will impose a freeze on spending.    It's a dilemma. To hold on to his Reagan-Republican core, he wants to avoid anything resembling an open split with the president or his policies. He knows right-wingers will push hard on the platform and he will have to decide soon how much he is willing to give them. But he will be dealing from a position of considerable strength: He has wrapped up the nomination and he is likely to be opposed by a liberal Democrat. Conservatives may not trust Mr. Bush but they are going to have to vote for him.    But, if he is to reach out in the general election to independents and Democrats who are less enchanted with Mr. Reagan, he needs to demonstrate he is his own man. He will have to decide soon -- just how conservative he really is.    So far, he has worked on a very narrow base, with obvious weaknesses in those parts of the country where Mr. Reagan's ratings aren't so high. Congressional Quarterly notes that in caucus and primary voting in Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota and South Dakota Mr. Bush failed to carry a single county. A traditional solution to that kind of problem is to turn to the troubled territory for a running mate.    By wrapping the nomination up so early, Mr. Bush and his staff will now have time to get some rest and then think some of these problems through. Mr. Bush will continue to campaign -- he has vowed to campaign in every caucus and primary state -- but he will be on the road no more than two or three days a week. He may take a trip abroad in June.    He doesn't worry much about visibility, knowing the focus now shifts to the continuing battle for the Democratic nomination. That doesn't trouble his people, because they think the warfare will seriously damage the Democrats.    The inner-core staff that started the campaign with Mr. Bush is still there, and now it is really going to be tested as the campaign tries to reach out to a new, and more skeptical, audience. The key members are Lee Atwater, 37 years old, the campaign manager; Robert Teeter, 49, pollster and strategist; Peter Teeley, 48, the press spokesman; Rich Bond, 37, political organizer; and Roger Ailes, 47, the TV consultant.    It was this group that weathered the campaign's one major crisis -- the third-place finish (behind Mr. Dole and Mr. Robertson) in the Iowa caucuses that the media almost universally declared to be &quot;humiliating&quot; for Mr. Bush.    Rumors persist that the Bush organization almost unraveled as the campaign moved in despair from Iowa to New Hampshire. One report said Mr. Atwater was close to being fired. There were other rumors about some people beginning to panic. In all of this, it is said, the one cool voice of reason was Mr. Teeter's, perhaps the most experienced and knowledgeable member of the team. &quot;He was the glue that held it together,&quot; says one insider.    &quot;There was no emotionalism,&quot; argues Mr. Teeley, and Mr. Atwater's job was never at risk. &quot;Why would we fire the one guy who knew most about South Carolina, the next big contest?&quot;    The loyal Mr. Teeley also says Mr. Bush himself was cool and steady through the crisis. He credits Mr. Bush with the best single idea to come out of those chaotic days: bringing the old right-wing warrior, Barry Goldwater, to New Hampshire to endorse Mr. Bush (for the second time).    The team held together and Mr. Bush made a remarkable recovery, dashing Sen. Dole's chances.    Eventually, it's expected the team will be joined by Treasury Secretary James Baker, who was Mr. Bush's campaign manager when he lost to Ronald Reagan in 1980. Mr. Baker, 57, probably will be given the title general chairman, in a move that may or may not win full acceptance from younger staffers who have delivered the goods up until now. </TEXT></DOC>
