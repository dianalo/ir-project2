The states, joined by the National Audubon Society, asked theU.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to reviewEPA's refusal to act on their petition seeking those controls.   That petition called on EPA to publish for public comment thedetermination of the Carter administration's EPA chief that sulfurdioxide emissions from the United States were harming Canada. Such apublication is the first step in drafting a regulation.   The Canadian province of Ontario and two environmentalorganizations filed a similar lawsuit in the same court on Nov. 1.   A few days before leaving office in January 1981, EPAAdministrator Douglas Costle wrote Secretary of State Edmund Muskiethat these emissions were harming Canada by being transformed in theatmosphere into sulfuric acid, which falls as acid rain in easternCanada.   Many of these sulfur dioxide emissions originate in the U.S.Midwest in power plant and factory smokestacks.   Once such a determination is made, U.S. law requires EPA to orderaffected states to revise their air pollution control plans toeliminate the offending emissions. But the appeals court, in adecision upheld by the Supreme Court, ruled earlier that a letter tothe secretary of state was not formal enough, and any suchdetermination had to be made in formal proceedings leading to aregulation.   Ontario, the nine states and various environmental groups allpetitioned for such formal proceedings, but EPA in October said itwould not act on those petitions because it still did not knowenough to tell states in the Midwest how to revise their airpollution control measures.   Environmentalists say acid rain has made hundreds of lakes in theAdirondack Mountains of New York State unlivable for fish. Canadasays 14,000 lakes in the eastern half of that country have beendamaged.   David Wooley, an assistant attorney general of New York State,one of the plaintiff states, said in Albany, N.Y., the states areentitled to sue because they are harmed by the same pollutantharming Canada. He said he has asked that his lawsuit beconsolidated with Ontario's.   In addition to New York, the plaintiff states are the six NewEngland states, New Jersey and Minnesota.</TEXT></DOC>
