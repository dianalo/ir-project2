The company said it earned $5.9 million, or three cents ashare, in the quarter ended Nov. 24, up from $3.5 million, orone cent a share, in the year-earlier period. Revenuedeclined to $413.2 million from $427.4 million a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   Gilbert F. Amelio, National Semiconductor's president andchief executive officer, attributed the earnings improvementto greater manufacturing efficiencies and cost reductionsfrom consolidation. The company took charges of $149.3million in the first quarter and $141.2 million the yearbefore for expenses related to the consolidation.   For its fiscal first half, National Semiconductor reporteda loss of $162.1 million, or $1.61 a share, compared with aloss of $162 million, or $1.62 a share, in the year-earlierperiod. First-half sales dropped to $824.2 million from$870.1 million.   National Semiconductor's two biggest rivals in SiliconValley, Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., havebenefited from relatively strong demand for Intel's 386 lineof personal-computer microprocessors, which Advanced Microhas cloned. National Semiconductor said demand for most otherkinds of chips used in personal computers and peripherals,and in other industries such as aerospace and autos, remainssoft because of the recession.   Mr. Amelio said the company &quot;is tracking well toward thetargeted break-even point of $400 million {in sales} in thethird quarter of fiscal 1992,&quot; but added, &quot;we now expectbusiness conditions to remain soft through the first quarterof calendar 1992 and that our fiscal third-quarter revenuewill exhibit the usual seasonal slowdown.&quot;   The company's stock was quoted at $5.875, up 37.5 cents ashare, in late New York Stock Exchange trading.</TEXT></DOC>
