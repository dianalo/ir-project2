The 41-year-old Mr. Smith, former director of management information systems for Frost Brothers, succeeds Dean Morrow who resigned.    Mr. Morrow's resignation comes less than two weeks after MicroPro's former president and chief executive officer Leon Williams left the company. Mr. Williams was succeeded by Gari M. Grimm.    A company official said Mr. Morrow decided to resign instead of accepting a MicroPro offer to be &quot;repositioned&quot; in the software company.    For the fiscal year ended Aug. 31, MicroPro had a net loss of $5.1 million on sales of $42.5 million. The loss included a $1.8 million charge from the settlement -- in which the company acknowledged no wrongdoing -- of a class action shareholder lawsuit that claimed the company misrepresented its prospects in its 1984 initial offering and in subsequent statements.    A spokeswoman said the company doesn't anticipate any further management changes in the near term. </TEXT></DOC>
