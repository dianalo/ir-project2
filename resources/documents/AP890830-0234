But the Resolution Trust Corp. Oversight Board, headed byTreasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, said Tuesday the overseersstill want to be consulted before regulators give final approval tocomplex transactions.   The policy directive, issued by the oversight board after aprivate, telephone conference, was the latest salvo in thesquabbling between bank regulators in charge of handling failed Sandamp;Lsand the administration officials who control the purse strings.   The law signed by President Bush on Aug. 9 authorized $50 billionin spending on failed Sandamp;Ls and created a two-tier bureaucracy forhandling the work.   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., an independent regulatoryagency, got control of the Resolution Trust Corp., or RTC, which isdoing the disposal work.   But Brady's oversight board, which also includes Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan and Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, sets thepolicies governing how the $50 billion is to be spent.   The FDIC has been chafing under the arrangement. Last week, FDICChairman L. William Seidman said regulators have been ready to putfive multi-billion-dollar institutions up for sale, but have had todelay action, driving up the ultimate cost of the Sandamp;L crisis.   Regulators held off because the oversight board directed them tocomplete only relatively simple transactions until it decides,probably within several weeks, on a policy for disposal techniquesfor large institutions.   So far, the FDIC has closed 11 small Sandamp;Ls, transferring theirdeposits to other institutions or paying off customers directly. Butit has not tackled the kind of large deals that require thegovernment to issue guarantees or assume part ownership of a rescuedSandamp;L.   Oversight board spokesman Art Siddon said the policy was revisedTuesday to point out that ``simple does not mean small'' and thatregulators can get started on complex deals.   Members of the congressional banking committees, who are onvacation until after Labor Day, are expressing concern about theintramural squabbling, saying they intended that the FDIC would beable to move swiftly without undue restrictions.   In a second move, the oversight board told the FDIC to makedisposing of failed Sandamp;Ls its first priority. After that, it shouldbe ready to deploy funds to resolve depositor runs. The thirdpriority is replacing high-cost deposits with low-cost governmentfunds.   The insertion of the second priority effectively replacesarrangements made early this year under which the Federal Reserve,Treasury and regional Federal Home Loan Banks agreed jointly to pumpcash into any institutions suffering liquidity problems.</TEXT></DOC>
