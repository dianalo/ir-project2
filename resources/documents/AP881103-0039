It was the worst political clash in Seoul since majoranti-American protests last summer. Many police officers andstudents suffered cuts and other injuries from firebombs and rocks,but there were no overall figures.   Police did not say if any protesters were arrested.   In Seoul, about 3,000 students fought police in four areas nearChun's house in a fashionable residential suburb. Clashes were alsoreported in several provincial cities.   ``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan. Punish (President) Roh Tae-woo,''students in Seoul shouted as they hurled firebombs and repeatedlycharged police despite a dense fog of tear gas.   About 9,000 police were posted along streets and alleywaysleading to Chun's house to repel the protesters. Police used teargas whenever students tried to break through their lines.   Traffic came to a standstill and most shops in the areas wereclosed as the fighting persisted for several hours. Many pedestrianswore gauze masks or put hankerchiefs over their noses to filter outthe acrid tear gas.   In front of Sogang University at the center of Seoul clashes,about 700 students, brandishing hundreds of firebombs, repeatedlycharged about 500 riot police who were blocking their march. Policeretaliated with tear gas.   Firebombs exploded in showers of orange flames near or amidstcolumns of police, who deflected the missiles with shields and putout blazes with hand-carried extinguishers.   Several blocks away, near the house of opposition leader KimDae-jung, another group of 500 students battled police with rocksand firebombs. Kim's house is about eight blocks from Chun's.   In the southern city of Kwangju, about 2,000 students held campusrallies or took part in street protests to demand Chun be punishedfor alleged corruption and human rights violations.   In Chunchon and Ansung in eastern and central South Korea, dozensof students also attacked with firebombs a police station and agovernment party office. No injuries or major damage was reported.   News reports said thousands of students had held anti-Chunrallies on their campuses to prepare for a march on Chun's house.Fighting erupted at some schools as students tried to march out.   Anti-government demonstrations have been escalating in recentweeks as radical students organized ``save-the-nation suicidesquads'' and threatened to raid Chun's house to press for his arrestand punishment.   The anti-Chun march was part of anti-government strategies byradical students, who are also calling for an ouster of PresidentRoh.   They argue that hte Roh government is dragging its feet on aprobe of alleged corruption and other scandals involving theex-president, his family members and associates.   Roh and Chun, both former army generals, have been close friendssince they were classmates at Korea Military Academy in the 1950s.Roh succeeded Chun, who stepped down following protests at the endof a seven-year term in February.   Chun has come under public fire for his alleged misuse of powerduring his tenure. One of his brothers, Chun Kyong-hwan, has beensentenced to seven years in prison for taking bribes and embezzlingmillions of dollars worth of official funds.   Former Seoul Mayor Yom Bo-hyon, a close confident of Chun, wasalso sentenced to a five-year jail term last month for taking bribesand illegally helping the business of some family members of theex-president.   Chun is also under investigation for his alleged role inmilitarily suppressing a 1980 civil uprising in the southern city ofKwangju that resulted in the deaths of about 200 people.</TEXT></DOC>
