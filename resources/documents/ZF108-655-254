 Clearly, this was the direction set byHewlett-Packard when it introduced NewWave three years ago.andP;  Now, ATandamp;T is thesecond company to put groupware concepts at the center of its softwarestrategy for the coming decade.andM;ATandamp;T is adding value and integration to pieces of software from varioussources in hopes of moving quickly into this potentially lucrative softwareand service market.andM;ATandamp;T's office product is part of a larger strategy that calls for thecommunications giant to become a major applications software supplier andsystems integrator.andP;  The strategy is called &quot;Business Orchestration&quot;; thesoftware implementation, &quot;Rhapsody.&quot; This terminology underscores ATandamp;T'sidentification of a critical problem that plagues organizations trying to usetechnology to solve organizational problems.andP;  Many organizations approachchange by simply applying technology to their existing set of procedures.andO;Traditionally, this has been a dismal failure and a key reason why no onelikes to talk about office automation anymore; instead of solving problems,you throw some technology at them so they can occur faster and more often.andM;The concept of business orchestration is much more subtle than simple officeautomation.andP;  To implement business orchestration successfully, ATandamp;T and itsbusiness partners work with a customer to conduct a complete needs analysis.andO;Then the vendor and customer work together to restructure tasks to increaseproductivity.andP;  Once a company's processes and procedures are streamlined,ATandamp;T will offer a set of services to augment the different way of workingthat is beginning to dominate the '90s-the workgroup model.andP;  This modelincludes groups of users from different areas and disciplines within anorganization coming together to complete a particular project.andP;  It requires adifferent breed of software as well as a different way of thinking about howpeople work together.andM;The path that ATandamp;T has mapped out for itself will not be easy.andP;  It could wellbe analogous to the work that imaging pioneers have faced as they tried toexplain why and how customers should add image management into theirorganizations.andP;  While the concept makes perfect sense, the implications fororganizational restructuring are enormous.andP;  Even when an organization agreedthat image-based systems were essential, it would often take years before thecompany was prepared to purchase and implement such a system.andM;ATandamp;T seems ready to undertake this long sales cycle and educational role.andO;That is perhaps the advantage of its telephone company heritage.andP;  It has thefunding to stick out some lean time in order to reap some potentially bigrewards.andM;AN OBJECT-ORIENTED MODEL.andP;  Object orientation is at the core of ATandamp;T'sdesign.andP;  The advantage of this modular approach to design is that a companycan more easily mix and match component parts without rewriting code.andP;  To itscredit, ATandamp;T understands how difficult it is to write complex applications.andO;Therefore, it is leveraging what it can license from others.andP;  The company ispicking up Hewlett-Packard's NewWave as the base user interface and itsObject Management Facility (OMF) as a way to achieve object exchange over thenetwork.andP;  The workflow automation software, a major part of Rhapsody, isprovided by Workhorse Systems Limited, a small software company based inDublin, Ireland.andP;  For imaging software, ATandamp;T looks to Plexus'sclient/server-based image management system.andP;  ATandamp;T uses its own mail API totie these various components together.andM;RhapsodyandM;Rhapsody consists of many different components, but the heart of the productis workflow automation-also known as procedural automation or taskflowautomation.andP;  In general, workflow automation is a series of consecutive-orsimultaneous-tasks that follow the flow chart of a particular process oractivity.andP;  Each step is automated, keeping track of the status of the processand plugging all the holes.andP;  The potential of workflow automation is seeinghow these tracking and hole-plugging activities can be left to a computeengine so that the people involved in a procedure can spend their time makingdecisions-actually thinking-rather than routing paper and tying up looseends.andM;SERVER-BASED WORKFLOW AUTOMATION COMPONETS.andP;  In Rhapsody, workflow isprovided through the Workhorse software that resides on the host.andP;  It isgeared to large-scale, corporate-level workflows, such as routing travelreports throughout the company with the appropriate levels of approval.andO;Another use for this software is to establish workteams that convene for ashort period of time to complete a specific project.andP;  Components of theWorkhorse software include:andM;* Meeting Management, which is a tool used as a combinedandM;electronic mail and scheduling facility.andP;  It can both scheduleandM;meetings and resources and remind individuals about theirandM;commitments.andP;  While the software is being developed byandM;Workhorse, the mail transport is ATandamp;T mail and uses its APIs.andM;* Task Manager, which allows for an &quot;action item&quot; (e.g.andP;  aandM;To-Do List item) to be shared among several participants whoandM;are involved in a group project.andP;  Documents can also be sharedandM;through this mechanism.andP;  To notify different group membersandM;of tasks, the system uses the ATandamp;T mail APIs.andM;* Appointment Manager, which is an electronic calendar.andM;* Workflow Management, which is a tool aimed at a programmerandM;that allows an administrator to develop a set of workflowsandM;across the organization.andP;  Complex conditions and requirementsandM;can be programmed into the system.andM;CLIENT COMPONENTS.andP;  NewWave is the basis of ATandamp;T's client software.andP;  Rhapsodyuses both the basic NewWave icons and a series of its own desktop devices.andO;Currently, the Object Management Facility is only used at the client level.andO;Objects are moved from user to user via electronic mail.andM;DESKTOP AUTOMATION.andP;  The Desktop software is based on the NewWave desktop.andO;This is where ATandamp;T uses the Agent Facility (called the &quot;Baton&quot;) to link asequence of keystrokes and menu commands.andP;  ATandamp;T is aiming the &quot;Baton&quot; at endusers.andM;ATandamp;T has added three features to the NewWave desktop:andM;* The Cards, a series of rolodex cards that include informationandM;about individuals and companies.andP;  Cards can be linked.andP;  ForandM;example, a card on an individual can be linked to a card aboutandM;that person's company.andM;The Document Manger, a simple document managementandM;system that allows documents to be stored in a library andandM;searched via author, creation date, or keyword.andP;  While it canandM;replicate a document so that several users can view it, theandM;last version of the document put back into the documentandM;manager will override any other document changes.andP;  The DocumentandM;Manager does not provide version control.andM;* To Do List, a desktop icon where a user's work items or tasksandM;are stored.andP;  It uses the mail API.andM;APPLICATION MACRO LANGUAGES.andP;  ATandamp;T has added value to HP's basicencapsulation technology.andP;  Encapsulation allows an application not writtenspecifically to the NewWave API to be represented as an icon on a NewWavedesktop.andP;  With HP's version, the encapsulated application takes control ofthe screen.andP;  ATandamp;T has extended encapsulation so that an encapsulatedapplication can be dragged and dropped on the printer or fax icon.andP;  Becauseof the extended encapsulation, ATandamp;T claims that users can use eachapplication's macro language.andP;  However, this is somewhat misleading.andP;  Forexample, a user would have to learn a different macro language for eachapplication, such as Lotus 1-2-3, Excel, or MS Word.andP;  But at least ATandamp;T is onthe right track.andP;  Users do need macro languages, though one that can be usedacross many different applications is preferable.andM;DEVELOPMENT TOOLS.andP;  To allow users to create icons and then tie applicationsto the mail transport, ATandamp;T has created a set of services.andP;  These include:andM;* Desktop Controller.andP;  The Desktop Controller is an API that ties Unixapplications to the Object Management Facility.andP;  Its first use is to allowUnix-based ATandamp;T Mail to be used as a transport for NewWave applications.andM;* Pad.andP;  The Pad is an end-user tool for replicating an object.andP;  The term Padrefers to a  pad of forms.&quot; The Pad can save a series of keystrokes in iconicform.andP;  For example, a user could use the Pad to create an icon of a tailoredExcel spreadsheet.andP;  Then that user could mail the icon to another user whowould be able to simply double-click on the icon and access the applicationas well as the specific spreadsheet.andM;* Box.andP;  Users can copy a series of objects to be stored inside another objectcalled a box.andP;  By double-clicking on the box, a user can retrieve any one ofthese objects.andM;* Briefcase.andP;  The Briefcase is an iconic representation of a floppy disk.andP;  Auser wishing to take files home would drag them to the Briefcase icon andthen copy them onto a physical floppy.andM;* Paper-Clipped Set.andP;  ATandamp;T has adopted the metaphor of a paper clip as a wayto link a series of documents.andP;  Although this has similarities to the folderconcept, there are subtle differences.andP;  In a folder, for example, there is nohierarchy.andP;  In a clipped set, a user can establish a specific order to thedocument.andP;  Also, a group of documents can be treated as one object and sentto the printer or fax machine.andP;  Rhapsody also includes a paper-clip dispenseras an end-user tool to retrieve an old paper clip and to establish a new set.andM;* DOS Object Renamer.andP;  An encapsulated application can be given a new namewhich is associated with the existing DOS name.andP;  The user first gives theencapsulated application a standard 8-character filename.andP;  The user thendrags the new object to the DOS Object Renamer icon, where it can be given amore meaningful 32-character name.andM;ELECTRONIC MAIL AND NETWORKING.andP;  The LAN-based mail system used withinRhapsody is ATandamp;T's PMX/StarMail.andP;  It is based on ATandamp;T's implementation ofMicrosoft's LAN Manager for Unix networks (LM/X).andP;  ATandamp;T has added PCnetworking services such as file/print sharing, remote administration, andsupport for distributed networked applications.andP;  ATandamp;T has also added its ownPrivate Mail Exchange (PMX) Distributed Directory Services that can manage acorporate directory and distribute it to multiple PMX post offices located ondifferent servers.andM;While LM/X provides the primary server, connectivity to outside systems isaccomplished through a series of gateways and connectivity tools.andP;  For IBMconnectivity, ATandamp;T is offering a 3270 emulation, RJE, support for SNA viaHILLAPI and SNA/Link.andP;  An asynchronous gateway provides communication toother LANs and hosts.andP;  Remote Rhapsody users mn attach to a system via a PCgateway.andM;DatabaseandM;ATandamp;T is using the Informix database management system as a data manager andSQL engine.andP;  Query and reporting will allow users to access data on mainframedatabases.andP;  It is a relatively simple data extract tool.andM;Client SoftwareandM;Because of the predominance of DOS in the marketplace combined with ATandamp;T'suse of NewWave, MS Windows is ATandamp;T's first client interface.andM;ATandamp;T has added the following features to the NewWave client capabilities:andM;* Personal desktop tools.andP;  ATandamp;T has chosen to support several popular DOSproducts.andP;  Some, like Microsoft's Word for Windows and Excel, have beenwritten for Windows.andP;  They are encapsulated to run under NewWave.andP;  Others,like WordPerfect 5.1 and Lotus 1-2-3 Release 2.2, are non-windowedapplications and have a less sophisticated level of encapsulation.andP;  Forgraphics, ATandamp;T has chosen Micrografx GraphPlus 2.0, which is a Windowsapplication.andM;*  Facsimile support.andP;  Any printable object such as a document or spreadsheetcan be sent to a fax machine by dropping that document on the fax icon.andM;ADMINISTRATION.andP;  Administration is provided at three different levels:end-user tools, systems administrator, and systems maintainer.andP;  A user can dosimple chores, such as giving another user access to documents and calendars.andO;Users can also check the status of printers and other global resources.andP;  Thesystem administrator has an iconic interface to functions like adding anddeleting users.andP;  A higher level of administration includes facilities likeproblem determination and resolution.andP;  Also included are low-level Unixsystem and StarGROUP software administration tools.andM;CLIENT/SERVER.andP;  Rhapsody is intended to be client/server based.andP;  On theserver side, ATandamp;T has opted for 386/486-based technology and will rely onLANs as departmental solutions.andP;  The first server will be Unix running ATandamp;TSystem V.3.2.andP;  The first client will be DOS using Windows 3.0.andP;  Currentthinking at ATandamp;T is that Unix will be its second client, and, &quot;if there issufficient demand,&quot; OS/2 will be a third choice.andM;ATandamp;T will have some trouble with this priority ordering.andP;  While it is indeedwise to start with a DOS desktop, the company should reconsider relegating anOS/2 client to the future.andP;  We suspect that OS/2 will be accepted as a clientmore rapidly than Unix.andP;  But ATandamp;T is the owner of the Unix operating system,and that puts it in an awkward position.andP;  By dismissing Unix as a client,ATandamp;T admits that Unix has limitations and that OS/2 has to be takenseriously.andP;  We suspect that, over the next three to five years, ATandamp;T willlearn through experience just what the market will accept and will rethinkits &quot;not invented here&quot; attitude.andM;PRICING.andP;  Pricing is not terribly aggressive.andP;  At the desktop, ATandamp;T requiresa minimum of a 286 PC  their own, Compaq's, or IBM'S) with 4MB of memory.andO;The client software sells for about $5,000.andP;  The server is a 33NM 386.andP;  Torun the software requires a minimum of 8MB and a 130MB hard disk.andP;  A systemthat supports from 20 to 50 users, including software, sells for about$70,000.andM;MARKETING.andP;  ATandamp;T has decided to focus its sales efforts on the small andmedium-sized business market that has been virtually untapped by itscompetitors.andP;  Given ATandamp;T's low profile in the computer business and its highprofile as a primary telephone system provider to this business sector, thisis probably a logical move.andM;To meet the needs of this market, the Rhapsody software, as well as theoperating system, will be preloaded onto the hardware by ATandamp;T.andP;  This shouldbe attractive to smaller companies that don't have a sophisticated in-houseMIS department or that have limited resources.andM;While this will be appealing to many organizations, there is a downside.andO;ATandamp;T is neither willing nor able to offer its software on non-ATandamp;T hardware.andO;If an organization should decide it wants to adopt Rhapsody, it will probablywant to add it to its existing servers-not necessarily ATandamp;T's.andP;  This isespecially important for organizations that will want to include largenumbers of employees in a workflow automation system to make it truly useful.andO;ATandamp;T may therefore be missing a golden opportunity to own a customer's entiresoftware operation.andP;  Psychologically, if a customer installs one vendor'ssoftware throughout its organization, it will be more likely to trust thatvendor's hardware as well.andP;  This point seems lost on ATandamp;T's marketers.andP;  Theyare afraid that if they put their software on other servers, they willpotentially lose hardware sales.andM;CONCLUSION.andP;  ATandamp;T is off to a good start.andP;  It has the right business modeland the right kind of software to do a credible job.andP;  But the road will notnecessarily be easy for the telecommunications giant.andP;  First, ATandamp;T ispromising delivery by third quarter.andP;  However, its primary Workhorse serversoftware has not yet been completed.andP;  Workhorse Systems' earlier efforts havebeen standalone PC systems.andP;  Therefore, ATandamp;T's software will be a customprogramming effort.andM;Another concern is that ATandamp;T has not yet published its mail APIs, which areso critical to Rhapsody.andP;  It needs to provide these APIs to softwaredevelopers so that more vertical business packages can be added to theRhapsody environment.andP;  We are also concerned that the workflow software willrequire too much programming expertise at the customer level.andP;  Atannouncement, ATandamp;T wasn't able to demonstrate the programming tools, and wesuspect that programming isn't a task that a business analyst could easilyundertake.andP;  We understand that ATandamp;T does intend to write a front end for thisworkflow software in the future.andP;  We urge the company to make it a highpriority.andM;ATandamp;T's services for compound documents and group document processing areweak.andP;  So far, it only has the ability to provide multiple copies of the samedocument.andP;  More sophisticated tools will be required in the future.andM;ATandamp;T will have its work cut out for it as it enters the office softwaremarket for the first time.andP;  It will learn a lot and will have to play closeattention to potential customers if it expects to have a shot at becoming amajor player.andP;  The company faces two major challenges: creating acomprehensive software environment and educating the market on the benefitsof Business Orchestration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
