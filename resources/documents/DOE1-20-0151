Chapter 2 deals with the progress made inmeasuring and control techniques, while Chapter 3 discusses the progressmade in constructing mathematical models of the in-furnace state. Chapter4 deals with the quantification of the flows of gas, liquid and solidmaterials in the upper and lower parts of the furnace, and related phenomenasuch as flooding, fluidization, coke movement, raceway behavior, thedead coke zone, and the flow of hot metal and slag at tapping. Simulationtest data are also presented. In Chapter 5 the in-furnace high temperatureproperties of agglomerated iron ores are discussed with regard to establishingimportant parameters for the construction of mathematical models as wellas predicting zone position and level. Chapter 6 deals with the subjectof raceway phenomena and tuyere combustion zone models, while Chapter7 examines slag-metal-gas reaction, with particular emphasis on silicontransfer in the lower part of the furnace. Finally, Chapter 8 presentsa number of views regarding future blast furnace technology.</TEXT></DOC>
