Goldner, manager of the Software Business Group at the Apollodivision, said the addition of Oracle will strengthen Apollo's presence inthe &quot;compute-intensive workstation marketplace,&quot; where the RDBMS hasestablished a foothold.andP;  Oracle is prevalent in aerospace, financial,automotive and pharmaceutical markets.andM;Version 6.0 is the first portable RDBMS capable of handling on-linetransaction processing (OLTP) applications, according to Oracle officials,who said that the architecture of the Series 10000 is well-suited to OLTPjobs.andM;The RISC-based architecture of the Series 10000 supports and schedulescompute-intensive queries transparently while Oracle 6.0 automaticallyschedules applictions over all available processors on the system.andM;Oracle officials said the 10000's highspeed bus, disk-stripping and largephysical memory provide enough throughput to eliminate I/O bottlenecks thatare common in environments where heavy data-access tasks are the norm.andM;The OLTP function of Oracle 6.0 caused Oracle headaches back in March whenthe product was initially released.andM;VMS versions lacked the multi-instance support necessary for the the OLTPoption to run concurrently on every computer in a VAXclsuter.andP;  (See &quot;OracleV6 Shipped Despite Bug; Clusters Missing 1 OLTP Option,&quot; Digital Review,March 13, page 78.)andM;Oracle version 6.0 is available now for all Apollo workstations and personalsupercomputers.andP;  Prices range from $5,000 to $13,000 on a per-user basis.andM;The Apollo Division of Hewlett-Packard is located at 330 Billerica RoadChelmsford, MA 01824, (508) 256-6600.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
