In HistoryI the stress level of ratchetting was equal to the stress reached at1% strain. For History II the stress level was established to be thestress reached after a 2100 s relaxation at 1% strain. Significant ratchettingwas observed for History I at room temperature but not at the elevatedtemperatures. The accumulated ratchet strain increases with decreasingstress rate. For History II no ratchet strain was observed at room temperatureindependent of the stress rates used. This observation is explained inthe context of the viscoplasticity theory based on overstress by theexhaustion of the viscous contribution to the stress during relaxation.The viscous part of the stress is the driving force for the ratchettingin History I. Strain aging is presumably responsible for the lack ofshort-time inelastic deformation resulting in a nearly rate-independentbehavior at the elevated temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
