(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A year after being taken hostage by twoshotgun-wielding Indians, the staff of The Robesonian made jokes andfielded crank calls as they worked to get the newspaper out, theireditor said Wednesday.   ``We thought there might be some crank calls, and there were,''Bob Horne said. ``People called up and said `Happy Feb. 1,' or`Happy Anniversary.' Nothing too serious.''   A year ago Wednesday, Tuscarora Indians Eddie Hatcher and TimothyJacobs held up to 20 staff members hostage for 10 hours while airingcharges that local officials were involved in drug trafficking. Thesiege ended when Gov. Jim Martin agreed to form a task force toinvestigate the charges.   Both Indians were found innocent of federal hostage-taking andfirearms violations in October, but now each faces 14 state chargesof kidnapping. Hatcher is seeking refuge with the Shoshone-BannockIndians in Idaho, while Jacobs is awaiting an extradition hearinglater this month in New York.   Horne said the scene in the newsroom was much different from lastyear, when some terrorized staffers feared for their lives afterbeing posted as human shields in doorways.   ``There's been some joking today about the incident, which Ithought was positive _ that people could joke about it,'' he said.   Horne said the newspaper noted the anniversary with a long storyinterviewing leaders from the county's black, Indian and whitecommunities about changes that have taken place in the last year.   The takeover, and the fatal shooting of Indian judicial candidateJulian Pierce a month later, resulted in the establishment of ahuman relations council for the county, a public defender's officeand a second Superior Court judgeship that Martin filled with anIndian lawyer.   Jacobs and Hatcher on Tuesday sued Martin, state Attorney GeneralLacy Thornburg and 18 other state and county officials. The lawsuitasks a federal judge to block their extradition and prosecution onthe kidnapping charges because their civil rights have been violated.   Thornburg said Tuesday the state will press for the extraditionand prosecution of the men despite the lawsuit.   The U.S. Attorney's Office in Raleigh has issued a federalwarrant for Hatcher charging him with unlawful flight fromprosecution. Gloria Dupree, a spokeswoman for the office, saidWednesday that the warrant issued Monday would allow federal agentsto arrest Hatcher and return him to North Carolina to face thekidnapping charges.   An FBI spokesman in Charlotte said whether FBI agents could go onthe Fort Hall Reservation in Idaho to arrest Hatcher would depend onlocal arrangements with the reservation.   ``Some reservations have asked the federal government to act as apolicing authority on the reservation,'' the spokesman said. ``Somereservations have said `No, we want to do it ourselves.'</TEXT></DOC>
