Still, monetary policy-makers in Japan and West Germany will look to the U.S. Federal Reserve for leadership in deciding whether to tighten credit conditions, analysts say.    If the Fed continues its series of modest policy tightenings, it's reasonable to think the Bank of Japan and Bundesbank &quot;would want to keep up at least part of the pace&quot; and not allow interest rate differentials to get too wide, said Mitchell Held, chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.    Meanwhile, British officials have to cope with a currency turnaround of a more pronounced nature. The quick drop in the pound already has prompted a half-point increase in British base rates to 8%, and another rise would likely follow further significant deterioration.    The bright side of a sick dollar for foreign central bankers had been the anti-inflationary influence of their strong currencies. With that aid threatened, more direct action will be contemplated to quell concerns about potential wage and price rises stemming from high money and economic growth, analysts say.    The stable dollar gives foreign central bankers more leeway to &quot;sneak in some modest (tightening) moves,&quot; said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank here. But he and other analysts emphasize that any restrictions in policy abroad will be quite small.    One reason is that the dollar's newfound firmness, based on improved trade data and recent Fed efforts to raise interest rates, could be short-lived. Strong tightening moves in Germany or Japan might be enough to spark a backslide, not to mention a rattling of world stock markets.    It would have seemed outlandish a couple of weeks back to talk of reported central bank intervention to stem the dollar's rise. But that's what apparently happened last week.    Anthony Karydakis, money market economist at Mitsubishi Bank here, cautioned against reading &quot;too much into that.&quot; Rather than trying to set a ceiling for the dollar, authorities' intervention probably was &quot;more in line with a desire to restore orderly conditions,&quot; he said.    If central bankers in other nations are looking to the Fed for their cues, they may have to wait. Analysts don't expect U.S. central bankers to provide any imminent new impulses.    Friday's U.S. employment report, which offered the first broad look at the economy in May, was enough of a mixed bag not to prompt the Fed to add to the three small tightenings it's already executed since March, analysts said.    While the civilian unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage point to 5.6% and non-farm jobs gained a moderate 209,000, analysts say the Fed will find plenty to worry about in the report's wage indexes, which showed significant gains.    The Fed &quot;will be monitoring it very closely&quot; to see if high capacity usage and tightened labor market conditions are indeed starting to work through to wages, said Mr. Karydakis.    Mr. Chandross cited significant wage increases in the category that includes financial, insurance and real estate employees. If the group is viewed as a proxy for white collar workers, &quot;that raises a red flag to me,&quot; he said.    For now, analysts expect the Fed to stand pat, awaiting more data on prices and the economy.    Inflation hasn't been gaining in Japan, though money growth has held above target and growth has been strong. In fact, the nation's gross national product may have grown at a double-digit rate in the January-March quarter, an Economic Planning Agency official said.    But even a high growth rate doesn't mean Japan is entering a new &quot;high growth period,&quot; said Masaru Yoshitomi, director-general of the economic research institute of the planning agency. &quot;When there is no inflation and no prospects for acceleration, why should we try to reduce the growth rate?&quot;    That relative lack of concern, and lack of overt tightening, is reflected in a yield curve in Japan that has changed little in the past month.    The same is true in West Germany. On May 6, a domestic German three-month money market rate stood at about 3.50%, while the benchmark 10-year German government bond yielded 6.49%. Now, those rates are 3.60% and 6.59%, respectively.    In the U.S., it's been a different story. The spread of the 30-year bellwether bond's yield above that of the two-year note has narrowed significantly. A month ago, the 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 yielded 122 basis points above the two-year note. Friday, that spread was 104 basis points.    But much of the narrowing in the yield curve is attributed to the rally in long-term Treasurys earlier this week, a rally many analysts saw as spurred by short-covering and thus viewed with skepticism.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity -   The dollar was mostly firmer, finishing a week in which the U.S. currency moved broadly higher, the pound plummeted, and the market unwound cross positions.    In trading that dealers said was subdued compared with activity earlier in the week, the dollar was higher against most major currencies except the yen.    Traders said some residual cross-trading and squaring of positions before the weekend supported the dollar. The pound was soft as funds continued to trickle out of the British currency, traders said.    Late in the New York day, the dollar was quoted at 1.7278 marks, up from 1.7201 marks late Thursday, and at 125.98 yen, off from 126.13 yen. The pound was quoted at $1.7964, down from $1.8047.    In early trading in Tokyo Monday, the dollar opened at 126.32 yen.    On the week, the dollar was up from 1.7178 marks late last Friday and from 124.93 yen. The pound was down from $1.8574.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $464.80 an ounce, down $2.20. Estimated volume was a very heavy 7.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $464.10 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Friday, June 3, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
