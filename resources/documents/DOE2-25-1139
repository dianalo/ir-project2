<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-1139 </DOCNO><TEXT>Examines welding of cutter holders to the augering unit used by both Sovietand foreign mining machine manufacturers. Studies effect of welding onstrength of cutter holders by testing 5 different types of cutter holdersat a temperature range of 0-1000 C using type TXA-0806, 625-27 thermocouplesand type H115 oscillograph for recording temperature at various pointsof the cutter holder area. Provides diagrams of cutter holders testedand lists test conclusions. Establishes reasons for reduction in hardnessand recommends type of welding most suitable for retention of cutterstrength.</TEXT></DOC>
