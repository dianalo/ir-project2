<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0840 </DOCNO><TEXT>Numerous meetings have been held and a debate has developed in the biologicalcommunity over the merits of mapping and sequencing the human genome.In response a committee to examine the desirability and feasibility ofmapping and sequencing the human genome was formed to suggest optionsfor implementing the project. The committee asked many questions. Shouldthe analysis of the human genome be left entirely to the traditionallyuncoordinated, but highly successful, support systems that fund the vastmajority of biomedical research? Or should a more focused and coordinatedadditional support system be developed that is limited to encouragingand facilitating the mapping and eventual sequencing of the human genome?If so, how can this be done without distorting the broader goals of biologicalresearch that are crucial for any understanding of the data generatedin such a human genome project? As the committee became better informedon the many relevant issues, the opinions of its members coalesced, producinga shared consensus of what should be done. This report reflects thatconsensus.</TEXT></DOC>
