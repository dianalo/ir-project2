Cohen recalls.andP;  &quot;Now we find ourselves in the situationwhere we're pretty well automated.andP;  When one of those boxes goes down forsome reason, which luckily doesn't happen too often, people go crazy.andO;They've forgotten how they used to do things.andP;  You laugh, but it's so true.&quot;andO;It's a story that no doubt warms the hearts of Data Generalhs marketingagents.andM;But, as is often the case with anecdotes, Cohen's story misses teh bigpicture.andP;  &quot;The larger issue,&quot; says Steve Wendler, an analyst for GartnerGroup Inc. of Stamford, Conn., &quot;is that the [current generation of officesystems] failed to deliver on the promise of greatly improved white-collarproductivity.&quot;andP;  According to Gartner Group's research, &quot;white-collarproductivity in 1987 was exactly at the same level it was in 1967.andP;  This isafter all of the huge investments in PCs and integrated office systems,&quot;Wendler says.andM;VEndors have been promising vast improvements in office productivity at leastsince 1971, when Xerox Corp.'s Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), for example,launched its &quot;electronic office of the future&quot; project.andP;  Office automation inthe 1980s failed to increase productivity, even with its ubiquitousintegrated packages that put everyone in the department in lockstep behindthe same applications.andP;  For the 1990s, vendors are focusing on officeautomation offerings that they describe as a suite of services.andP;  Thesepromise to allow users to create custom office systems for the enterprise, atlast curing the white-collar productivity doldrums.andM;In recent months, Data General, Digital Equipment Corp. and IBM have allannounced their next-generation office automation systems for the comingdecade.andP;  The stakes for these vendors are impressive.andP;  Gartner estimates thatthe number of desktop devices devoted to office automation will grow fromabout 10 million today to 100 million by the mid-1990s.andP;  If accurate, thattenfold growth, necessarily accompanied by increased sales in systemssoftware, applications software, servers of every size, printers, otherperipherals and the like, will mean more than just pocket change forsuccessful players.andM;Information systems departments have a stake in this game, as well.andP;  Whereasthe PC revolution of the 1980s largely by passed IS, the quintessentialoffice automation scheme of the 1990s depends on a client-server architecturethat encompasses everything from the mainframe to the laptop.andP;  The challengesof this architecture, such as network management and distributedapplications, cannot be met without IS skills.andM;Wendler's metaphor for the course of office automation may illustrate how besto implement the ideal 1990s architecture.andP;  He likens historical OA trends toa pendulum, swinging toward clerical workers with the advent of stand-aloneword-prcessing systems, then toward IS as host-based integrated officesystems took hold, then toward managers as PCs flooded the world's offices.andO;The most effective implementation of the new generation of office automationsystems, according to Wendler, &quot;will be performed by those organizations thatstop the pendulum of control from swinging wildly between those groups.andP;  MIShas to reach out and work with users, and end users have to work with MIS.&quot;andM;Finding the right system to create that balancing act is one of the majorchallenges in implementing the next generation of office automation.andP;  Onedifficulty is that vendors aren't so much selling products for today as theyare selling visions of new computing platforms for the future--IBM with itsSystems Application Architecture, Digital with its Network ApplicationsServices, Data General with its Distributed Applications Architecture.andO;Eventually, each vendor's client-server architecture will meld with itsoffice automation system, but not for five years, perhaps 10.andM;In the meantime, vendors describe the visions by reciting a familiar litanyof features--adherence to standards, multivendor support, consistentgraphical user interfaces, transparent access to hosts andservers--descriptions so much alike that Herb Osher, Data General's directorof distributed computing and office systems, expects any customer attemptingto compare them to experience a sense of deja vu.andM;Splitting Up the ApplicationandM;&quot;The application is being split up from one huge application that does a lotof different types of things on one host to smaller applications running onservers,&quot; says Ann Palermo, director of office systems research atInternational Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andP;  &quot;It ties in the oldtime-sharing systems with a modernized client-server model.andP;  The vendors areapproaching this--some with more vigor than others, some more blatantly, sometrying to disguise it--but all the vendors are moving in this direction.&quot;andM;Although they appear headed for eventual convergence, the new generation ofthe various office automation systems platforms have their differences.andP;  Onthe one hand, Digital's All-in-1 Phase II, announced last fall, supportsmultivendor desktop workstations, including Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintoshand IBM PCs and PS/2s running the MS-DOS and OS/2 operating systems.andP;  On theother hand, IBM's Office Vision products, announced last spring, playstrictly in an IBM environment.andP;  Data General's CEO Object Office, announcedin September, supports MS-DOS on the desktop and Data General's proprietaryMV operating system on the server side of the architecture, although thecompany is promising a UNIX version.andM;But users aren't buying platforms and applications only for today, they'rebuilding office automation systems that can sustain real improvements inproductivity over the long haul.andP;  To move toward that end, businesses arecharting their own cautious, creative courses through the confusion.andM;Office workers at American Airline's SABRE division beta tested CEO ObjectOffice, the newest version of Data General's popular CEO software.andP;  Cohen isa fan and says his division will most likely keep the package.andP;  With it,users can choose applications tied to personal productivity, such as wordprocessing, and still access the department's minicomputer for groupservices, such as electronic mail.andM;Putting Ideas To WorkandM;Because the product that Cohen's division markets, the SABRE airlinereservation service, runs on Data General's MV minicomputer line, CEO was anatural choice.andP;  However American Airlines as a whole is taking far moreambitious path to office automation, one that is more creative than cautious.andO;Called InterAAct, the estimated $150 million homegrown system will combinedata processing, office automation, personal computing and networking intoone system.andP;  Early last fall, InterAAct was installed in the company'sheadquarters, the first phase in implementing a corporatewide systemscheduled for completion in mid-1991.andP;  By Thanksgiving, American Airlines wasreevaluating both the scope of the project and its deadline.andM;Originally, each of the airline's 70,000 employees was to have at leastpart-time use of one of 14,000 PCs linked in a corporatewide system,providing access to everything from spreadsheets to host-based databases.andO;Launched last summer, the project was going to take two years.andP;  &quot;Thattimetable was a little ambitious,&quot; admits John Hotard, manager of corporatecommunications for information systems.andM;For one thing, tests of the system at company headquarters indicated that14,000 terminals were probably too many, Hotard says.andM;Probably a more pressing issue is that vendors aren't delivering thetechnology at a pace quick enough to meet the airline's timetable, Hotardadds.andM;ATandamp;T, IBM and Tandy Corp. are supplying 386 and 386/SX workstations, theintelligent desktop devices that are key to American's new model of officecomputing.andP;  Hewlett-Packard Co.'s NewWave software and Microsoft Windows,along with a mouse, will provide the object-oriented, consistent graphicaluser interface that is central to next-generation systems.andP;  Local areanetworks (LANs) from Provo, Utah-based Novell Inc. will provide access toprinting and other services.andP;  The LANs, or in some cases individualworkstations, will connect to a series of HP 3000s for electronic mail andcalendar applications.andP;  A private X.25 network will combine InterAAct, SABREand its Systems Network Architecture.andM;American Airlines is expecting the system to provide the major gains inproductivity that have eluded previous generations of office systems.andO;Management and clerical workers are expected to increase productivity by 7%.andO;Another 2% improvement is expected as a result of giving employees moretimely and accurate access to the company's data.andP;  It will happen, saysHotard, just not on the original schedule.andP;  Hotard declined to suggest arevised timetable, however.andM;Testing the WatersandM;While American Airlines splashes ahead, other companuies are more comfortablejust testing the waters.andP;  Cigna Corp. in Philadelphia is taking a tentativestep toward IBM's Office Vision and SAA architecture, says Ernie Smithdirector of office productivity.andP;  Like American, the company is looking foran integrated office system that spans the entire organization, rather thanjust departments.andP;  But whether the insurance and financial services companyand its 48,000 employees in offices worldwide decide to stay on the OfficeVision course depends on how well IBM delivers on its promises, Smith says.andM;For instance, despite the fact that OfficeVision, on both the client andserver side, is limited to IBM's prorpeitary operating systems, the computergiant is as vocal about open systems as any other vendor.andP;  &quot;Although wedidn't focus on it in the original announcement, it will be clear that theOffice Vision bundle will support the national standards and all the keystandards,&quot; says Tony Mondello, vice president for office systems at IBM'sapplication systems division.andM;Great, says Cigna's Smith.andP;  &quot;We are not interested in having a proprietaryfuture, especially when it comes to how I'm going to deliver a trulyintegrated environment.andP;  It's not going to come all from IBM, and it's notgoing to come all from Cigna.andP;  It's got to be open to other third-partydevelopers.&quot;andP;  Eventually, IBM is going to have to deliver more than rhetoric.andO;&quot;This [Cigna's move to OffiveVision] is by no means a firm, hard, fastcommitment,&quot; Smith says.andP;  &quot;We are interested in making sure IBM followsthrough.&quot;andM;Cigna is migrating from an ad hoc environment, which was built on thephilosophy that every division was best suited to make its own decisionsregarding information systems.andP;  &quot;That got us going into multiple differentdirections,&quot; Smith says.andP;  The result is a mixed bag--a base of IBM'sSystem/36 minicomputers, Wang Laboratories Inc.'s VS minis, 30 to 40 PC-basedlocal area networks, standalone PCs and PCs connected to hosts.andM;&quot;We've now changed that to say 'let's establish some common [OA] offeringsacross the corporation, and then let's build our individual [business] systemstrategies on top of that consistent, common platform,'&quot; he adds.andP;  At somecompanies, a philosophy like Cigna's would likely entail a client-serverarchitecture functioning as a common foundation allowing individual users toselect whatever word-processing program they like and still access commonservices, such as a remote printer or an electronic mail sysstem.andP;  Cigna isimplementing it a bit differently, however.andM;You Take the High Road .andP;  .  .andM;The headaches that accompany such a wide open style outweigh the advantages,according to Smith.andP;  &quot;WordPerfect, for instance, is the only word-processingsystem that we're looking to endorse.andP;  While, yes, there may be some pros andcons, and some products may be a little bettr or a little worse than othersin various areas, it's such a basic function that you don't get any realvalue from having multiples.andM;&quot;We're really driving after enterprise productivity,&quot; Smith continues, &quot;andthat is a lot of the reason why we are saying you need some of these basic,common tools to just be taken for granted.&quot;andM;Cigna is beginning to implement its system, based on OS/2 LAN servers andMS-DOS clients.andP;  The company wants to move OS/2 on the client side, as well.andO;For now, availability and pricing remain an open question, and one that'sdelaying any final decisions, Smith says.andP;  Sometime during the next sixmonths, IBM is likely to provide some answers--and Cigna's strategy for OS/2should crystallize them, he adds.andM;Eventually, via cooperative processing, the company's office automationplatform will reach directly into the bread and butter applications residingon the corporate mainframe, Smith says, although he's expecting a longmigration path.andP;  &quot;Today, that is more of a vision than something we can startimplementing.andP;  You can start doing some prototypes and some early installs,but a lot of the development products and support products that we need areon the horizon--they're not in our hands today.&quot;andM;Because of such uncertainties, Cigna is choosing to take a short step down along path.andP;  &quot;None ofthis is to say that we're through with all of theevaluation, that we really know everything there is to know and we'refull-speed ahead,&quot; Smith says.andP;  &quot;We've got a lot of things to learn as we godown that path.&quot;andM;I'll Take the Low RoadandM;In contrast, General Dynamics Corp. is taking long strides down a narrowpath.andP;  The St. Louis-based defense giant is using Digital's All-in-1 productto build a corporatewide electronic mail system.andP;  The company is forgingahead, with some 16,000 employees at nine regional sites already connectedvia Digital's VAX computers, says Rik Drummond, the corporation's electronicmail program manager.andP;  Based on Consultative Committee on InternationalTelephone and Telegraph (CCITT) X.400 standards, the network will eventuallylink General Dynamics to some of the thousands of subcontractors andsuppliers it deals with.andM;For now, electronic mail is the corporation's office automation strategy,according to Drummond.andP;  &quot;What we're really doing is focusing on puttingtogether a very, very solid electronic mail and office systems backbonenetwork that handles business data and interpersonal messaging in a securemanner and a cost-effective manner,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Unlike most big corporationswho have 15 different mail vendors in house and are trying to put themtogether right now, we have one and we're just making a few adjustments.&quot;andM;The plan allows some flexibility at lower levels, Drummond adds.andP;  &quot;In acorporation as big as ours, each division is quite often amultibillion-dollar entity in its own right.andP;  We're asking these generalmanagers to go out and do their business, make money and reach the bottomlines.andP;  We need to allow them some room to choose the appropriate electronicmail and office systems which will support their business needs best.&quot;andM;What managers will get is a choice between limited options approved at acorporate level--based on a client-server architecture and adhering to anX/Windows-style user interface--as well as communications protocols that canplay with the All-in-1 corporate mail system.andP;  Drummond sees the userinterface as a primary benefit.andP;  &quot;The cost of machines, the cost of softwareand the cost of overall support is dropping very rapidly,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;What'snot dropping is the cost to train users.andP;  When we go to an office system andimplement all the white-collar workers, we're talking 50,000-plus people.andO;That's a sizable investment.andP;  If you can decrease training by 10 hours peryear for some reason, or create ways for people to learn better on their own,you've made some major reductions in cost.&quot;andM;Indeed.andP;  The vision of a new generation of office systems that reallydelivers improved performance is alluring.andP;  Tom Forester, author of high-TechSoeiety (Cambridge, Mass: The MIT Press, 1987), estimates that in the UnitedStates alone, some 55 million white-collar workers collect more than $1trillion in annual salaries.andP;  Accordingly, every 1% improvement inproductivity would yield better than $10 billion in savings for U.S.andO;businesses each year.andM;Of course, a clear goal doesn't equal a clear path.andP;  When General Dynamicslooks beyond electronic mail to a broader office package, the vision gets alittle hazy, Drummond admits.andP;  &quot;It's all unclear,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;We are allwaiting to see what happens out there.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
