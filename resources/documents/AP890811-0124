The criticism came as U.S. officials continued to seek Syrianhelp in obtaining the release of eight American hostages held bypro-Iranian militants in Lebanon.   ``The United States condemns the indiscriminate slaughter ofinnocent people and the renewed use of heavy caliber weapons, suchas the 240-millimeter mortar, which are in the Syrian arsenal,''said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   ``We again call upon Syria, an active participant in thefighting, the Lebanese armed forces, as well as the variousLebanese factions, for an immediate cease-fire, the lifting of allblockades, and the initiation of a dialogue for the politicalreconstruction of Lebanon,'' she added.   The State Department has in the past generally refrained fromsingling out the combatants by name, preferring to call forrestraint by all sides.   The latest round of fighting in the five-month artillery warover control of Beirut came on Friday, when Syrian and Christiangunners dueled with howitzers and rocket launchers, killing sixpeople. The fighting followed 15 hours of fierce fighting Thursdaythat escalated sharply when Syrian gunners targeted thepresidential palace with 240mm mortars.   ``The escalation and the shellings and the dramatic increase incasualties give urgent impetus to our call for the Arab League toovercome the obstructions facing it and resume its efforts onbehalf of the people of Lebanon,'' Tutwiler said.   Several weeks of mediation efforts by leaders of the 21-nationArab League have failed to bring about a lasting cease-fire.   Tutwiler said the United States, through its embassy inDamascus, approached the Syrian government about the hostages. Theapproach came after a group of kidnappers claimed last week to havehanged Marine Lt. Col. William Higgins and the State Departmentsought to determine his fate.   ``We have continued our contacts to try to assure that Syriawill do everything possible to assist in a successful resolution tothe hostage crisis,'' she said.   U.S. policy toward Syria treads a delicate balance of criticismof the Soviet-backed government for its support of Palestinian andShiite terrorism and seeking to enlist its support for theArab-Israeli peace process and other negotiations in the volatileregion.</TEXT></DOC>
