The Emerging Company Marketplace would constitute a newtier of stocks on the Amex. To qualify for listing, companieswould have to meet lower financial standards than on theexchange's main tier.</LP><TEXT>   Amex directors proposed the market last September. Formalapproval by the Securities and Exchange Commission isexpected soon, an Amex spokesman said.   The spokesman said 15 to 20 companies -- ranging frommedical technology concerns to construction firms -- plan tolist shares on the marketplace on its first day of trading.The number could be up to 30 stocks, &quot;most of which now tradeon the Nasdaq system,&quot; by year's end, he said.   To be listed, a company needs assets of at least $2million if its stock currently trades on the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers' automated quotationservice, or Nasdaq, and between $3 million and $4 million ifit doesn't. In addition, candidates for listing will bescreened by a panel of members and selected outsiders todetermine their growth potential.   Part of the Amex's challenge to Nasdaq involves thecontinuing debate about the best way to trade stocks. Nasdaqissues trade electronically on screens with investor ordersalways passing through a dealer. But listings in the EmergingCompany Marketplace will be traded in the auction market thatthe Amex uses now. In an auction market, orders are sent to asingle trading post, run by a specialist, where investorssometimes trade directly with each other.   Issues listed on the Amex's Marketplace could continuetrading in other markets, like the Nasdaq. But the spokesmansaid the Amex &quot;wants the Emerging Company Marketplace to bean incubator-type market&quot; that will enable the smallcompanies to &quot;graduate&quot; to main-tier listings.</TEXT></DOC>
