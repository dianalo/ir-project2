First, more LBOs are running into financial trouble.Second, when LBO funds try to cash out by selling companies,they often can't get top prices.</LP><TEXT>   Finally, with the volume of buy-outs down 86% this year,LBO funds have been left with huge pools of capital thatremain uninvested. To put these unused billions to work, andmeet new stringent standards set by bank lenders, LBO fundmanagers are doing deals with a lot less leverage and moreequity.   As a result, some of the funds that once boasted annualreturns of 50% to 100% now say they are shooting for only 18%to 40% annually. &quot;The returns should be lower because thedeals require more equity; it's simple arithmetic,&quot; saysStephen Schwartzman, president of Blackstone Group, which hasan $850 million buy-out fund.   Last week, in a deal that exemplifies the new,less-leveraged buy-outs, the $1.5 billion LBO fund run byMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. paid $100 million to buy LondontownHoldings Corp., maker of London Fog raincoats.   Instead of selling high-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds orseeking new bank debt, the Merrill fund simply assumedLondontown's existing debts of $180 million. That gave thedeal a debt-to-equity ratio of less than 2-to-1, instead ofthe 10-to-1 debt-equity ratio that used to jet-propel thereturns of LBOs in the 1980s.   Here's why putting more equity into buy-outs can drag downinvestment returns:   A fund buys a company for $100 and sells it a year laterfor $110. If it puts down $10 in equity and borrows $90 forthe purchase, it clears $20 on the sale after repaying debt-- a $10 profit, or a 100% return. But if the fund puts down$40 and borrows only $60, the same $10 profit amounts to only25%.   James J. Burke Jr., president of Merrill Lynch CapitalPartners, Merrill's buy-out fund, says, &quot;The financingenvironment at the moment is as bad as I've seen it in 10years. The market for bank debt is in a complete state ofdisarray.&quot; Similarly troubled is the market for junk bonds,which financed most of the big LBOs in recent years.   Although the Merrill fund continues to pursue deals andhas completed nine buy-outs in the past 18 months, Mr. Burkesays Merrill has lowered its return target from 40% annuallyto as little as 30%.   Although the Merrill fund continues to pursue deals andhas completed nine buy-outs in the past 18 months, Mr. Burkesays Merrill has lowered its return target from 40% annuallyto as little as 30%, reflecting some of the buy-outs' moreconservative financial structure.   Executives of the largest buy-out group, Kohlberg KravisRoberts andamp; Co., declined to be interviewed. KKR touted annualreturns of 60% back in 1987 when the firm was seekinginvestors for a giant $5.6 billion fund. More recently, KKRhas suffered some high-profile financial setbacks with a fewof its buy-outs, among them Seaman Furniture and Jim WalterCo.   Now, a spokesman for the firm says, KKR's investmenttarget is a mere 18% to 25% annually. &quot;The standard quote isthat they expect to make three to four times their money insix to seven years,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;That's been theirpitch since the Stone Age.&quot; And one KKR investor notes thatthe Seaman and Jim Walter investments amount to less than 5%of the KKR fund.   Although 18% a year is still enough to outperform thestock market's long-term average 10% annual return, it's afar cry from 60%, particularly since buy-out investments arelong-term, illiquid, and expensive. And the pension funds andother big institutions that invest in LBO funds still mustpay annual fees averaging 1.5% of their commitments, even ifthe money is uninvested. That's more than double what theaverage stock manager charges.   One reason that the returns of LBO funds are falling isthat it's taking longer for them to resell at a profitcompanies they earlier bought. And the longer that takes, thelower the funds' annual returns will be.   For example, Merrill's first LBO fund, a smaller pool with$400 million, still owns nine of the 20 companies itpurchased between 1985 and 1988. At the end of 1988, thefund's annual rate of return was 58%. By the end of 1989,that annual rate had declined to 50%.   The bleak buy-out environment has driven some players tothe sidelines. Gibbons, Green van Amerongen Ltd., whichraised a $425 million fund in 1987, suffered financialreverses in two buy-outs in the past year, Sheller-GlobeCorp. and Ohio Mattress Corp. Its partners split up lastyear, and the firm doesn't have any plans for new investmentsor raising new money, according to a spokesman.   Some buy-out executives argue that the reduced level ofactivity and competition for deals will boost potentialreturns for those who remain on the field. &quot;Returns arelargely a function of purchase price,&quot; says Joseph L. Rice,president of the buy-out firm of Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc.Prices for new LBOs should be lower, he says, because &quot;atremendous number of marginal players have been pushed to thesidelines.&quot;   Mr. Rice adds, &quot;We're in the business of trying to achieve50% compounded on the funds that we're investing.&quot; Thattarget hasn't changed, he says. Buy-out financing will merelyrevert to &quot;the market that existed before 1983,&quot; when DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. popularized using junk bonds forbuy-outs.   Instead of new junk-bond issues, buy-out funds will revertto obtaining subordinated debt financing from insurancecompanies and other big investors in the private-placementmarket, Mr. Rice said. But that will limit the size of deals,because the private market isn't as deep or as easy to tap asthe public junk market.   Another buy-out firm that expects to prosper in thecurrent tougher environment is Forstmann Little andamp; Co. That'sbecause Forstmann has always shunned the use of junk bonds,relying instead for financing on its own $1.6 billionsubordinated debt fund, as well as a $800 million buy-outequity fund. That capability enabled Forstmann to do one ofthe largest buy-outs this year, purchasing the GulfstreamAerospace jet-plane maker from Chrysler Corp. for $825million.   ---                   Becalmed LBO Funds                                                                                                          Money remains unspent and returns fall at major leveragedbuy-out funds                                                                                                              SIZE          AMOUNT        PAST REPORTED    CURRENT       (In billions) UNINVESTED    ANNUAL RETURNS*  TARGET       (YEAR RAISED) (In billions) (DATE)           RETURNS                                                                                                        Kohlberg Kravis Roberts       $5.6 (1987)       $3.0      60% (May 1987)   18%-25%                                                                                                        Forstman Little       $2.8 (1988)       $2.4**    85% (1989)       N.A.
