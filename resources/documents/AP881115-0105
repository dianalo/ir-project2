It was the second surprise strike in as many months at thenation's second-largest commuter railroad, which serves the city'snorthern suburbs extending into Connecticut.   U.S. District Judge Robert Sweet signed a temporary restrainingorder at 10:15 a.m. and ordered the United Transportation Union topost a bond of $30,000. The railroad is seeking $1 million indamages from the union.   ``I will not defy it. I'm a law-abiding citizen,'' said JamesPhelan, the union chief. The UTU represents 770 Metro-Northconductors.   After the strike broke out, all trains were canceled and theentire railroad was shut down as other unions honored the picketlines set up by the conductors. The dispute also disrupted someAmtrak service.   Metro-North President Peter Stangl, who had called the strike``outrageous and illegal,'' said that the trains should beginrunning again at midafteroon. ``We'll have an evening rush (hour),''he said.   Phelan said the union struck because of a dispute about thecalculation of pension contributions and the timing of deposits.``On such a sensitive issue as pension, strict compliance isessential,'' he said.   But the railroad insisted it was in compliance.   At normally bustling Grand Central Terminal, no trains werearriving, ticket counters were closed and people hoping to leave NewYork City stood staring at the cancellation notices on the scheduleboard.   ``I've come all the way from Long Island,'' said Grace Giusto,who was supposed to attend a 9 a.m. business meeting in northsuburban White Plains. ``I'm really stranded.''   On the morning of Sept. 9, 780 Metro-North track workers from theTeamsters union staged a surprise strike, but the railroad obtaineda court order within hours that ended the walkout. That strike wasprompted by the suspension of 37 employees for refusing to workovertime, union officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
