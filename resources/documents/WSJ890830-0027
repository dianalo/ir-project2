But first they'll have to find them.    &quot;In the real world,&quot; says Polish economist Andrzej Bratkowski, &quot;a company has an owner. But not in Poland. We have convinced ourselves that it's natural for a company to have no owner.&quot;    There are sort of owners, state agencies that long ago gave up any responsibility for managing these companies or controlling their losses. There are sort of managers, usually Communist Party hacks put in top corporate jobs because of their faithfulness to the party line rather than to the bottom line.    But &quot;sort of&quot; isn't good enough when real money is on the line. &quot;No businessman is going to rush in here waving dollars, with a shaky government and standards of productivity in industry that are just plain unacceptable,&quot; says Sen. Frank Lautenberg, who has been touring Poland. &quot;Sure there are low wages, but those low wages are accompanied by low productivity, terrible equipment, and all the rest.&quot;    The New Jersey Democrat, who ran a computer company before his election to the Senate, met with Solidarity leader Lech Walesa, who asked for immediate and massive investment. &quot;There's a measure of naivety here,&quot; the senator says. &quot;They've got shipworkers making $50 a month and they expect them to outwork the South Koreans. The real world doesn't work that way.&quot;    American businessmen who know how the world works are, at least for the moment, mainly staying away from Poland. Apart from a few investments in the works, U.S. business reponse to Poland's experiment with political pluralism has picked up, but remains tepid.    &quot;It's a bit too early,&quot; says Jan Vanous of PlanEcon, a Washington economic consulting firm specializing in East bloc nations. &quot;Right now, there's nothing.&quot; He adds that there is far more foreign interest in Hungary, even though it has one-quarter the population of Poland and its wages are considerably higher. &quot;The Poles have a bad reputation, to put it bluntly.&quot;    Nonetheless, Poland's new Solidarity-led government is desperately seeking Western and Japanese aid. Solidarity strategists say that while they're not responsible for the wasteful practices of the planned economy that caused the country to build up $39 billion in foreign debt with nothing to show for it, Solidarity will get the blame if nothing is done.    They'd like forgiveness on interest payments on some or all of that debt, and an infusion of perhaps $10 billion in capital through joint ventures or direct aid. In return, Solidarity economists know they've got to take drastic steps to repair the economy. Among action under serious consideration: a wage-price freeze to attack the 100% annual inflation rate, the ending of wasteful subsidies to state firms, freeing currency exchange, and tax holidays for foreign investors.    A few companies may be attracted if such proposals turn into reality. Donald Hasfurther, director of East-West trade for the Chamber of Commerce of the U.S. in Washington, says he has seen a &quot;significant increase&quot; in inquiries from small and medium-sized U.S. companies interested in Poland in the past six months, &quot;tenfold what it was a year ago.&quot; But turning inquiries to deals will take time. &quot;If events in Poland proceed positively, it will have a very important long-term impact on our economic relations,&quot; Mr. Hasfurther says. &quot;They have so many needs, and there are so many opportunities. But in the short-term there may well be more confusion than light.&quot;    He adds: &quot;Unlike the 1970s, when the Singers, International Harvesters and RCAs all jumped in with multimillion-dollar deals, this time investment will be smaller and more focused.&quot; He says strategic areas will be food-processing, construction and tourism.    One pleased joint-venture partner is Marriott Corp. of Bethesda, Md. Its new $100 million, 525-room 41-story hotel will open late next month, and already dominates the Warsaw skyline. The company has a 25% equity interest in the hotel and will manage it, a first in Poland, where previously the state tourism arm, Orbis, insisted on retaining day-to-day control. A Marriott spokesman says the project &quot;was more time-consuming&quot; than Marriotts elsewhere, &quot;but it's certainly not impossible to do business in Poland and not really all that difficult.&quot;    The Poles are eager for such joint ventures, which not only bring in fresh money and expertise, but also partially privatize the companies, establishing a responsible owner. Solidarity says that while such a plan probably wouldn't work at Poland's huge state steel mills, for instance, it could work almost everywhere else.    Solidarity is trying to start by saving its birthplace, the huge Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk, where Mr. Walesa and colleagues began agitating for a free trade union in 1980. Polish-American heiress Barbara Piasecka Johnson is negotiating to buy a 55% interest in the shipyards for as much as $100 million. The former Communist government wanted to close the yards, which it said were losing money. Solidarity claimed that decision was political and argued that the yards could be profitable if they were better managed.    But a problem at the yards is one common to all Polish firms. &quot;Nobody really has any idea whether the Lenin Shipyards is making or losing money,&quot; says economist Ryszard Bujaj, a Solidarity member of Parliament. &quot;The books are a mess.&quot;    Another candidate for similar treatment could be the Ursus tractor factory outside Warsaw, says union activist Zbigniew Janas. He says the factory inefficiently produces 60,000 tractors a year with 24,000 employees. An infusion of $40 million in new machine tools could raise output to 80,000 a year, cut employment by 20%, and export 18,000 tractors a year, winning Poland badly needed foreign exchange. The factory has been plagued by strikes, but these have been over working conditions, not pay, and fresh investment would improve those conditions, Mr. Janas says. So far no Western company is interested.    Losing jobs at Ursus and elsewhere would be hard on Solidarity, Mr. Janas concedes, &quot;but it's inevitable that there will be fewer jobs. If not, the society will destroy itself.&quot; Mr. Janas adds: &quot;Our idea is to transfer control of thousands of factories to their workers by selling them shares at favorable prices. This would put them in charge and get them interested in working. Now nobody cares. But to make this work we need some capital.&quot;    If American industry isn't rushing in, will the U.S. government? Alan Cranston, one of several packs of American senators who visited Poland last week, says the U.S. should help Poland on all levels. &quot;There is a lot we can do that won't hurt the U.S. budget deficit,&quot; says the California Democrat. &quot;Debt forgiveness is one big area. Encouraging investment is another. Small-scale cooperation on research and technology is another. If there has been a case for restraint because of the Communist system, the events of the past few days have removed that restraint.&quot;    But Senate Minority leader Robert Dole, in another delegation, said &quot;we've got budget problems of our own.&quot; The Kansas Republican indicated the administration would remain cautious.    Sen. Lautenberg said that during his meeting with Mr. Walesa the Solidarity leader demanded immediate, hefty U.S. aid. &quot;He basically said that it was up to the U.S. to be the salvation of Poland right now,&quot; Sen. Lautenberg said. &quot;We made it clear the U.S. government can't do this.&quot;    The senator added that Solidarity officials, while describing the Polish situation as a &quot;house of cards&quot; that could collapse any time, &quot;also expect a wave of American businessmen to come in here and put down real money. I told him businessmen want to see stability first, then they'll come. There won't be a big flow of capital in here for a very long time.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
