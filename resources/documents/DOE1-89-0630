<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-89-0630 </DOCNO><TEXT>A process for separating a feed gas of methane and a lighter componentfrom substantial amounts of heavier naturally occurring hydrocarbonsin a mixed gas, is described comprising: A. Cooling the feed gas in anindirect heat exchanger with a single mixed component refrigerant havingat least three components with boiling points corresponding to the condensingpoints of the heavier hydrocarbons of the feed gas to produce cryogenictemperatures; B. Separating the methane and lighter components from substantialamounts of heavier naturally occurring hydrocarbons of the mixed gasin a distillation column using such refrigerant to provide heat energyfor the distillation; C. Compressing the refrigerant in a two stage compressorprior to step A; D. Splitting the compressed refrigerant from step Cinto two portions of different compositions; E. Supplying a first portionof the compressed refrigerant of step D for cooling in step A; F. Supplyinga second portion of the compressed refrigerant of step D to be cooledin exchange with the first portion; G. Feeding the second portion ofthe compressed refrigerant of Step F to the second stage compressor;and H. Feeding the first portion of the compressed refrigerant of StepF to the first stage compressor.</TEXT></DOC>
