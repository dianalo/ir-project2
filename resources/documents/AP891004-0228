The sun, which raises temperatures to 120 degrees in summer,disappears behind clouds only a few days a year and that's mainlyin some of the higher plateau regions.   A $26 million ``solar village'' with 160 photovoltaic solargenerators each containing 251 solar cells is operating in thedesert 32 miles northwest of Riyadh, the capital.   Built in 1982 as part of a $100 million Saudi-U.S. solarresearch cooperation agreement called Soleras, it is the largestfacility of its kind in the world and one of 10 in existence.   U.S. involvement in the project ended two years ago, but Saudisolar research continues.   Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, is hardlydesperate for an alternative energy source, but it is trying tolessen its economic dependence on oil.   Solar energy is still prohibitively expensive and relativelyinefficient.   Current technology can convert only about 12 percent of thesun's energy to electricity. Storage of the energy in solarbatteries, which last five to seven years, adds about 30 percent tothe production costs.   But officials at King Abdul-Aziz Center for Science andTechnology, a quasi-governmental organization that spearheads solarresearch, are not discouraged.   ``We knew it would be expensive at first,'' said Fahad Huraib,the center's solar research program director.   ``But most of the money went into research. It helped inpromoting this type of technology. To develop an energy sourcetakes from 50 to 100 years.''   The solar village contains a sophisticated solar laboratory,where environmental effects on the efficiency of solar energy canbe simulated and measured.   The village's original purpose was to use a concentratedphotovoltaic system to convert the sun's rays into 350 kilowatts ofdirect current electricity a day.   The beneficiaries are the 4,000 residents of three nearbyvillages. They received solar-generated electricity for five years,their first source of reliable power.   The villages are now hooked into Riyadh's main power grid, whichis also suppled by the solar village.   Saudi authorities hope that, in time, solar energy will be usedto bring electricity to all isolated villages.   Huraib said that could encourage people to stay in theirvillages and help curb mass migration to the cities.   In other parts of Saudi Arabia, solar projects are alreadyrunning. They include a water desalinization plant in the Red Seaindustrial city of Yanbu.   ``It produces 200 cubic meters (52,600 gallons) of water a dayfrom indirect freezing techniques using solar energy,'' Huraib said.   Concentrated heat from the sun produces steam that powers therefrigeration equipment for the system. As seawater is chilled,fresh water crystallizes and forms ice which is then washed andmelted.   In southern Saudi Arabia, highway tunnels through mountains areilluminated by on-site photovoltaic collectors.   Huraib said the Ministry of Transportation and Communications isstudying the possibility of lighting all remote tunnels in thismanner.   The kingdom's giant oil company, Saudi Aramco, is using solarenergy to provide cathodic protection for some of its pipelines inthe eastern province.   At the King Abdul-Aziz Center in Riyadh, solar thermal waterheaters service all staff housing.   Yassen al-Saedi, site manager at the solar village, said thatnext year the center will begin experimenting with solar-generatedirrigation on a half-acre vegetable plot.   But the most ambitious of the center's plans is a Saudi-WestGerman research and development project to produce hydrogen throughsolar energy.   ``Hysolar will be the largest project of its kind in theworld,'' al-Saedi said.   Financed by the center and several West German governmentorganizations, the project will use the solar village'sphotovoltaic solar generators to produce hydrogen by splittingwater molecules into hydrogen and oxygen.   ``It's the fuel of the future,'' Al-Saedi said.   Three major Saudi universities are also participating in theresearch.   The plan is to experiment with several possible consumerapplications, such as running internal combustion engines and as afuel cell to produce electricity.   Huraib does not rule out the possibility of exporting hydrogen.   ``It could be transported through the pipeline as a naturalgas,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs Oct. 12</NOTE></DOC>
