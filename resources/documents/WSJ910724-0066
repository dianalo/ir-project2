Your reporter stated that he was unable to reachme for comment over the weekend preceding the story, so Ioffer the following comments.   My Iran-Contra Committee service, which has been a matterof public record for four years, has had no effect on myoffice's prosecution of BCCI, notwithstanding the apparentspeculation of unnamed Senate sleuths. Notably, no Senateinvestigator has ever asked me about this previous governmentservice, nor was I asked about it when I testified at theSenate's BCCI hearing on May 23.</LP><TEXT>   Also, the article stated that I negotiated BCCI's guiltyplea. More accurately, I had no direct involvement in theplea negotiations; rather, I approved the plea agreementnegotiated by my assistants. Significantly, BCCI pleadedguilty to every legally sufficient charge and forfeited morethan $15 million, by far the largest forfeiture ever imposedagainst a bank. No one knowledgeable about the case and aboutthe sentencing judge has ever convincingly argued that thepenalty that might have been imposed after a trial would havebeen stronger.   Robert W.
