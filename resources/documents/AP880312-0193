Los Angeles-born Gilbert Galvan, 30, was accused of obtainingcash and jewelry worth more than $1.8 million (U.S.) in therobberies.   He was sentenced to 20 years in prison by an Ontario ProvincialCourt judge in Pembroke.   Galvan robbed banks in 14 Canadian cities from Halifax toVancouver, police said. The Peterborough Examiner said Galvanbecame known as the ``flying bandit'' because he traveled toholdups on Air Canada, the national airline.   He robbed one bank in Peterborough on three separate occasionsand once looted two banks in Regina, Saskatchewan, in less than anhour, according to police.   They said he carried a loaded gun but never committed physicalviolence.   Police said Galvan fled prison in St. Joseph County, Mich., onMay 18, 1984, with eight years still to serve for embezzlement.   He entered Canada using the alias of Robert Lee Whiteman andlater was married, according to statements to the court.   Police said Galvan's wife believed he was a computer salesmanand was shocked _ and pregnant _ when they arrested him in Pembrokelast June in connection with a holdup in London, Ontario.   He was sentenced to 11 years for that robbery, and police thenput together a case linking him with 58 additional bank and jewelrystore robberies.   His 20-year sentence will be served concurrently with the11-year term.   Some loot was recovered, but police said Galvan may have stashedmoney in banks in Europe or the Caribbean, where he oftenvacationed with his wife.   Police said Galvan always had a gun, always wore a disguise, andusually passed a note to a teller.   When he was arrested, police said Galvan told officers he wasonly going to ``do a few more and then quit.''</TEXT></DOC>
