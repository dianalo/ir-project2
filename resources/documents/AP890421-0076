However, the leaders, AFL-CIO vice presidents Jack Sheinkman andWilliam Winpisinger, told a news conference they believe suchindependent unions, like Poland's Solidarity, might surface.   ``If steps are not taken to adequately reflect representationand problems that the workers are putting to their leadership, thatkind of pressure might ultimately explode,'' Sheinkman said. He ispresident of the New York-based Amalgamated Clothing and TextileWorkers Union.   One of the tenets of communism is that workers' rights are a toppriority of the government, but trade unions have come underincreasing criticism for not aggressively prodding bureaucrats toimprove housing, salaries and working conditions.   At least two strikes by Soviet miners have been reported thisyear over low salaries and poor working conditions.   Sheinkman said he asked Stepan A. Shalayev, president of theAll-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, on Monday whetherindependent trade unions would be created in the Soviet Union.   ``This was not what they felt was necessary. ... Pluralism asdefined by him in our conversations meant pluralism within theexisting system and framework and not in terms of an independentunion such as exists in Poland,'' the American labor chief said.   But he said President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's reforms could leadto such unions because the government will not ``be able to put thenecessary checks on everything.''   Earlier this month, Poland's government ended seven years ofsuppression and legalized the trade union Solidarity.   Winpisinger, president of the International Association ofMachinists and Aerospace Workers, said he believes Gorbachev, whomhe met Wednesday, is aware of the faults of Soviet trade unions.   Gennady Yanayev, a secretary of the Soviet trade unioncouncil,told the news conference that officially backed trade unions havenot paid enough attention to the social and economic needs ofworkers but that improvements are under way.   ``We are confident the unions will be made an even more dynamicand efficient force, and given that I think there will be noquestion of the need for alternative groups,'' Yanayev said.   ``But,'' he added, ``life will show.''</TEXT></DOC>
