The Saturn plant will begin production in the summer of 1990 forthe 1991 model year. Most workers will be hired in mid-1989, whenSaturn begins production on pilot models, said Saturn spokeswomanLaurie Kay.   Saturn representatives will tour GM facilities around thenation, explaining directly to workers for the first time howSaturn will work and what a job there would be like.   Saturn already has received a number of resumes, but the pushannounced Monday is the first real recruitment effort it has made.   Under an agreement between GM and the UAW, GM workers will getthe first 6,000 Saturn jobs available over time, including theinitial 3,000. Saturn workers will be covered by a separate laborcontract from the national GM-UAW pact.   Like Japanese automakers that have hired for U.S. factories,including Mitsubishi Motors Corp. and Mazda Motor Corp., Saturn'shiring process will be lengthy.   Potential Saturn workers will go through an assessment processintended to give them an idea of what Saturn work will be like andwhether they want to do it, while giving Saturn an idea of how wellthe prospective employee works in a team situation, Kay said.   Saturn employees will work in teams, instead of performing moretraditional auto assembly work that consists of repeating oneprecise task over and over. Kay said the Saturn plant probably willrun on two shifts.   Workers' salaries will amount to 80 percent of GM hourlyworkers' base pay, with the 20 percent difference made up inincentive pay linked to such factors such as productivity increasesand Saturn's profitability, Kay said.   Active or laid-off workers who leave the GM system for Saturnautomatically give up any recall rights and seniority at GM plants,she said.   But at Saturn, their jobs would be protected during industryslumps because the company will be required to look for ways to cutits inventory that exclude laying off workers, Kay said.</TEXT></DOC>
