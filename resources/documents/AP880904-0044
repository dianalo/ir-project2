(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There's a new multimillionairesomewhere out there, as only one Lotto ticket held the six numbersneeded to win America's richest-ever lottery jackpot of at least$54 million, officials said Sunday.   The winning $1 ticket for Saturday night's drawing was purchasedin Longwood, a town of 14,500 in central Florida, Lottery SecretaryRebecca Paul said. She declined to name the store until the winnersteps forward.   Eight-digit riches were also doled out in New York, where onewinning ticket was purchased for a $23 million jackpot Saturdaynight, and in Illinois, where holders of four winning tickets willsplit a $21 million prize.   The previous national record jackpot, $51.4 million, was sharedby two California lottery players in June. A Pennsylvania couplehad the largest single-ticket lottery prize until now when they won$46 million in 1987.   The new Florida millionaire _ or millionaires, if severalpersons shared the ticket _ get 180 days to claim the prize. Theearliest it can be claimed is Tuesday, after the Labor Day holiday.   The prize will be doled out over 20 years. The state lotterywithholds 20 percent of large payouts for federal income taxes,although actual federal taxes owed could be higher. Florida has nostate income tax.   Splitting a $54 million payout into 20 installments, anddeducting 20 percent, would bring the annual check to $2.16 million.   Officials had estimated Saturday's jackpot at $52 million, but alast-minute frenzy of sales that sometimes topped 850 tickets asecond raised the total to $54 million. It could be even larger,depending on final sales figures.   Saturday sales totaled 14.6 million tickets, and total weeklypurchases were 44.78 million by the 11 p.m. drawing.   Players had turned to psychics, gimmicks and other formulas tobeat the 14 million-to-1 odds of picking the six winning digits outof 49. The winning numbers were 3-5-19-20-27-35.   Until Saturday, there hadn't been a winner in the drawing sinceAug. 6. That boosted the jackpot with each passing week.   ``This became an international news story. What better way tolet people know about your lottery than through an internationalnews story?'' Mrs. Paul said at a news conference. Florida beganits lottery only this year.   At least $20 million of the week's lottery profits will go tostate education, she said.   Longwood Mayor David R. Gunter said he was delighted to have the$54 million ticket sold in his town. The bedroom community 18 milesnortheast of Orlando has several lottery outlets.   ``I think we're due to be on the map,'' said Gunter. ``This isone great way to put us on it. It's always good to have a smallcity wake up and learn that one individual has had such fantasticluck.''   Besides the jackpot, more than 1 million other Lotto players wonsmaller prizes.   Ticket vendors across the state reported brisk Saturday sales.   ``Frantic isn't the word,'' said James Salvatore, owner of LottoNews in Miami. ``It's madness.''   Meanwhile, lotteries in other states credited Florida's Lottowith boosting their sales.   ``That kind of publicity raises the awareness of lottery ofeveryone in the nation, and we all see an increase in sales,'' saidKathy Rem, a spokeswoman for the Illinois lottery.   As in Florida, the winners of the $21 million Illinois drawingand the $23 million New York lottery were not immediatelyidentified.   The winning ticket in New York was sold in prosperousWestchester County, north of New York City, while the four winningtickets in Illinois were sold in the suburbs of Chicago.   Florida Lottery spokesman Ed George spoke via telephone on anArizona radio talk show and said he was deluged with questions frompeople who wanted to play Florida's game.   ``I told them to climb into a good solid car or buy a planeticket and come on out and visit,'' George said.</TEXT></DOC>
