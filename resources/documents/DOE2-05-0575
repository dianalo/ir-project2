<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-05-0575 </DOCNO><TEXT>Analysis of the investigative data pertaining to this incident revealsthe following conditions as key findings and probable causes: (1) Thecontractor failed to properly implement the surveillance program formonitoring reactor pressure vessel embrittlement. (2) Contractor andDOE organizations provided less than adequate oversight and independentoverview, especially by not requiring operating organizations to providedocumented evidence to substantiate claims that there was ``no problem''with respect to embrittlement. (3) Although the temperature limitationfor reactor pressurization identified in the Technical Specificationswas never violated, the basis of this safety limitation was violated.(4) The basis for concluding that there would be no embrittlement ofthe pressure vessel steel over the expected life of the reactor is questionable.(5) The contractor and DOE failed to make the surveillance program visibleby incorporating it in the Technical Specifications. (6) The AccidentAnalysis/Final Safety Analysis Report was never adequately reviewed andupdated subsequent to its initial issuance. (7) Surveillance specimenanalysis was incomplete and never transmitted to reactor operating personnelin a usable format prior to November 1986. (8) There was extensive delays(many years) in the testing, analysis, and reporting of surveillanceprogram results.</TEXT></DOC>
