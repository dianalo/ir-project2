LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Police began arming themselves Thursdaywith semi-automatic rifles to guard against firebomb attacks byprotesters demanding the ouster of President Roh Tae-woo.   The announcement of the measures prompted riots by thousands ofstudents in six cities.   Police also put about 5,000 investigators of the 130,000-memberforce on alert and ordered them to arrest leftists, the newspaperChosun Ilbo reported.   Senior government officials, who refused to be furtheridentified, said police were being issued about 13,000 M-16 riflesafter the government approved better weapons for police to helpdefend police posts and government facilities against mountingfirebomb attacks.   Government buildings and police stations have been the targets offrequent firebomb attacks by radical students. Police said scores ofpolicemen have been injured this year by firebombs.   The government action prompted a strong opposition backlash.Dissidents and opposition parties charged it could aggravate unrest,urged Roh to rescind the decision and planned a parliamentaryhearing on the issue.   The opposition Reunification Democratic Party denounced Roh'sdecision as ``tantamount to declaring a war against the people.''   About 5,000 students staged violent protests around campuses inSeoul and five other cities, according to the South Korean newsagency Yonhap.   In Seoul, riot police stopped about 800 students who tried tomarch out of Sejong University with firebombs and rocks to demandRoh' ouster.   In Suwon, 24 miles south of Seoul, about 700 students armed withhundreds of firebombs battled riot police for three hours,denouncing Roh's order. At least five students and three police wereinjured.   Yonhap also reported clashes in the southern cities of Kwangju,Chonju and Taejon and the eastern city of Chunchon.   Roh ordered security forces Wednesday to launch a crackdown onradicals and dissidents, warning they were a threat to stability.   ``All government offices must cooperate to root out the violentand destructive acts of leftists attempting to overthrow thegovernment,'' a presidential spokesman quoted Roh as saying.   Roh's order was seen as a warning to radicals, who have littlesupport but have organized numerous protests.   Prosecutor-General Kim Gi-chun followed up on Roh's directive byissuing orders Thursday for a clampdown on pro-North Koreanactivities.   Kim told a meeting of senior government prosecutors the nation'ssafety was at stake because of threats by leftist groups trying tooverthrow the government.   He ordered the seizure of all pro-North Korean publications andthe arrest of people using firebombs to attack government facilities.   On Monday, Roh postponed a promised referendum on hisperformance, citing threats from radicals and disagreement on how tohold the vote. Government hard-liners have urged Roh to end violentprotests and matain stability.   Many South Koreans are critical of the government for failing tosever ties with Roh's authoritarian predecessor, Chun Doo-hwan, whowent into rural exile in November after making a public apology formisdeeds under his reign.</TEXT></DOC>
