Col. William R.Higgins, a U.N. military observer in Lebanon, but did not mentionhis pro-Iranian abductors.   The resolution, adopted by a 15-0 vote, also demanded Higgins'immediate release and called upon U.N. members ``to use theirinfluence in any way possible to promote implementation'' of itsappeal for freedom.   Higgins was abducted Feb. 17 by a previously unknown groupcalling itself the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades. He is one ofnine Americans and nine other foreigners held captive bypro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.   Earlier Friday, Higgins' wife, Marine Maj. Robin Higgins, metwith Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. ``I am making aconstant effort to obtain his release,'' he told her. Mrs. Higginsdid not speak to reporters.   The secretary-general has raised the issue of the 18 hostagesduring talks this week with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali AkbarVelayati. The U.N. chief has appealed to Iran to use its influencewith the Islamic fundamentalist captors loyal to Iran to gain theirrelease.   An Iranian diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, latertold a reporter that there had been no response from Tehran to thesecretary-general's plea for Higgins' release.   ``I want to express my concern to you,'' Perez de Cuellar toldMrs. Higgins when she met him in his office. Higgins, of Danville,Ky., was chief of a U.N. military observer group when he wasabducted. The Vietnam veteran also served as an aide to formerDefense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.   Perez de Cuellar has met with relatives of other hostages aswell.   The council's brief resolution said the council already has``condemned unequivocally all acts of hostage-taking andabduction'' and called for the release of all hostages ``whereverand by whomever they are being held.''   Iran said Thursday it was concentrating on ending its war withIraq and had no plans to meet with former Democratic presidentialcandidate Jesse Jackson about freeing the American hostages.   Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati said that Velayati``doesn't have a mandate to embark on anything other thanimplementation of the Security Council Resolution 598,'' whichcalls for a cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war.   Velayati and Iraq's foreign minister are in New York to discusswith Perez de Cuellar efforts to bring about a cease-fire.   Mahallati said Velayati would ``indeed not'' see Jackson, whosaid he wanted such a meeting to seek the release of the U.S.hostages.   This week's peace talks raised hopes for gaining the release ofWestern hostages in Lebanon.   In Beirut today, the weekly mazagine Ash-Shiraa reported thatnegotiations are under way to free the hostages. It quoted anunidentified informed security source as saying that high-levelcontacts were under way between officials of the hostages' nationsand a state with ``direct influence on the hostages.''   The magazine gained international fame when it broke the storyof secret U.S. arms sales to Iran in return for the release ofhostages in 1986. But most of its recent reports on the hostageshave not proved accurate.   The hostage held longest is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. Anderson, 40, was abductedin Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.   Higgins, 43, is chief of the U.N. Troop SupervisionOrganization, a military observer group in the Middle East.   On Thursday, Jackson telephoned Perez de Cuellar about thehostages and asked him to convey a message to Velayati, U.N.officials said. They said the secretary-general did so. ButMahallati said his mission had not received a communication fromPerez de Cuellar.   Iran has said it could intercede to obtain the hostages' freedomif the United States agreed to release Iranian assets frozen in theUnited States.   The United States has said it is willing to discuss the issuebut has rejected any deal or payment of ransom.</TEXT></DOC>
