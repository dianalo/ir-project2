Lawton Chiles, &quot;we will have to ask all constituencies . . . to bear sacrifice.&quot;    That is the conclusion of a confidential memorandum used by the Senate Budget Committee chairman to explain the vexing dilemma he and fellow Democrats face. With majority control of both chambers of Congress, Democrats are now finding that they have a new responsibility for deficit-cutting that carries a heavy price.    &quot;This is probably a no-win situation all the way around,&quot; says Richard Moe, a veteran Democratic adviser. &quot;There is no good news fashioning a budget compromise.&quot;    Democrats insist they are making tough decisions. In the House, Budget panel members meeting in private sessions are deciding to cut funds for mass transit, foreign aid, space exploration and farm subsidies. In the Senate, a broad-based freeze is the best that most constituencies of domestic spending programs can hope for.    But it isn't clear whether the Democrats can hold it all together. They are, in many ways, at war with themselves over the deficit issue. While cutting in some places, they also are trying to make room to boost some spending programs, such as aid for the homeless, AIDS research, education and job training. There is vast disagreement between conservatives and liberals about how much to pare military spending.    Democrats also are fearful of Republican attack. Under orders from their leaders, they are moving to raise taxes yet still expect to fall short of Gramm-Rudman deficit targets -- two politically treacherous actions given President Reagan's balanced-budget, no-tax rhetoric.    Such a combination, chides Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa), &quot;is like sounding a retreat before the battle has begun.&quot; A tax increase, in particular, he adds, is &quot;license for fiscal irresponsibility.&quot;    At stake for the Democrats is a rare opportunity. In a significant change, polls show that the Democrats are drawing even with Republicans on the question of which party is better at keeping government spending under control. The enactment of a credible deficit-cutting plan that makes real spending cuts could go far toward erasing the Democrats' image as big taxers and big spenders. By forceful budget action, the Democrats also could capitalize on the advantage they already have with a president weakened by the Iran-Contra disclosures.    &quot;Democrats have the credibility&quot; on the budget issue, asserts Kirk O'Donnell, president of the Center for National Policy, a Democratic think tank. &quot;Now they have to make the record.&quot; Failure to come through with a deficit-cutting plan, he adds, would mean &quot;an opportunity lost.&quot;    The question of raising taxes is the Democrats' biggest hurdle. The party is split over whether it is wise to advocate higher taxes without the backing of President Reagan. Many remember the debacle of the 1984 presidential campaign when former Vice President Walter Mondale supported new taxes and President Reagan rode his anti-tax position to a landslide victory.    Despite misgivings, however, many Democrats seem to believe that times have changed, and that voters accept the need for increased revenues. Speaker James Wright (D., Texas) and the current crop of Democratic presidential candidates say that trying to reduce the massive deficits without taxes is like trying to put out a fire without water. Democrats go to great pains to note that about half the deficit reduction in President Reagan's own budget comprises revenue increases.    There is far less agreement among Democrats about how to deal with military spending. Speaker Wright has called for a $9 billion reduction in military outlays in fiscal 1988, but other Democrats in both chambers are resisting so large a cut. Some warn that any paring of the military budget could open the Democrats to the old criticism that they are weak on defense, lose them voters, particularly in the South, and incite conservative Democrats to ally themselves with Republicans to block a Democratic budget plan.    Reluctance of conservative Democrats to accede to military cuts has compelled liberals to resist cuts in social programs. This tug of war has impeded the ability of Democrats to complete their own budget proposal in the House Budget Committee. &quot;They are having trouble,&quot; says House Majority Leader Thomas Foley (D., Wash.). &quot;This is hard business.&quot;    The squabbling is compounded by President Reagan's unwillingness to compromise. He and congressional Republicans are poised to pounce on the Democrats for proposing to raise taxes, missing Gramm-Rudman's deficit goal of $108 billion in fiscal 1988, or both. The result is an ever-increasing interest by Democratic lawmakers in finding GOP allies for making tough choices and to devise strategems for laying blame on others if they don't find such support.    Today Chairman William Gray (D., Pa.) of the House Budget Committee will start public drafting sessions with an eye to educating both Republicans and Democrats about the near-impossibility of hitting the Gramm-Rudman goal without a tax increase and devastating spending cutbacks. Democratic leaders are considering holding out the threat of slashing programs to reach that goal as a way to compel more modest action.    The consequences of failure this year could be harsh. By mid-May, lack of a budget plan could prevent a necessary increase in the federal borrowing limit and precipitate a fiscal crisis. Politically, the Republican White House is required next year to propose a budget that brings the deficit down drastically to $72 billion -- a prospect that should make GOP presidential candidates cringe. Democratic candidates have their own worry -- the final deficit figure for fiscal 1988 will be released just weeks before the November election.    Last year, lawmakers resolved their responsibilities under the Gramm-Rudman law with a deficit-reduction package that everyone agreed was filled with false savings and exacerbated the problem they face this year.    &quot;It's a problem I feel a great frustration about,&quot; says Rep. Foley, remarking that the politics of the issue is clearly against a viable deficit-reduction plan. &quot;It can be mobilized to prevent serious and constructive action in the coming months,&quot; he says.    Ironically, the Democrats' key to success on the budget issue may well be an accommodation by the nation's top Republican, Ronald Reagan.    ---             The Budget Deficit Problem       (Fiscal years, in billions of dollars)                                1988    1989    1990    1991 Projected deficit            $170.6  $164.4  $136.8  $109.5 Gramm-Rudman deficit target   108.0    72.0    36.0     0.0 Required deficit reduction     62.6    92.4   100.8   109.5   Source: Congressional Budget Office</TEXT></DOC>
