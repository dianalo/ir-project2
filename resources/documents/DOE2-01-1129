The work was completed as part of the LLWDDD program todevelop, design, and demonstrate new low level radioactive waste disposalmonitoring methods. The objective of the project was to evaluate theperformance of three types of vadose zone samplers within a similar hydrogeologicenvironment for use as early detection monitoring devices. The threedifferent types of samplers included the Soil Moisture Equipment CorporationPressure-Vacuum samplers (Models 1920 and 1940), and the BAT Piezometer(Model MK II) manufactured by BAT Envitech, Inc. All three samplers aredesigned to remove soil moisture from the vadose (unsaturated) zone.Five clusters of three holes each were drilled to maximum depths of 45ft around part of the periphery of the landfill. Three samplers, oneof each type, were installed at each cluster location. Water sampleswere obtained from 13 of the 15 samplers and submitted to Martin Mariettafor analysis. All three samplers performed satisfactorily when consideringease of installation, required in-hole development, and ability to collectwater samples from the vadose zone. Advantages and disadvantages of eachsampler type are discussed in the main report.</TEXT></DOC>
