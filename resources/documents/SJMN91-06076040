NOW THAT'S RATIONING  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     What, you say? A 76 percent cut in use? Turn off the hot tub? Thedishwasher? The washing machine?;    Well, not exactly, it seems.;    Therationing plan, unanimously passed by the Purissima Hills Water District onWednesday night, calls for water flow restricters on households that use morethan 14,960 gallons a month -- or about 500 gallons a day.;    In Los AltosHills, where automatic sprinklers bathe palatial landscaped yards, that's apittance. In other parts of the state, it's about average use for a family offour. In Marin County, where residents are now being allotted 50 gallons a dayeach, it's sinful.;    But that's no solace to the 6,700 people served byPurissima, which gets all its water from the nearly dry Hetch Hetchy system(thus the cuts).;    Speaking at the meeting, resident Harrison Kornfieldcalled the board &quot;negligent&quot; for not finding water sources other than theHetch Hetchy system. He demanded that the staff come up with long-range plansin 30 days or be replaced.;    When Betsy Bertram urged resident to &quot;camp out&quot;and use buckets to catch excess shower water, a neighbor blurted that shedidn't buy a $1 million house to &quot;camp out.&quot;;    Those who defy the new rules,which start with a 66.3 percent cutback in April and peak at 76.4 percent inJuly and August, face shut-off of service. A $250 fee will be charged toreactivate service.;    But then, that's cheaper than a $10,000 lawn.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff Report  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910316  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  283  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 16, 199100076040,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
