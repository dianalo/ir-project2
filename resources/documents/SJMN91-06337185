It would add 1,400 apartments, condos and single familyhomes, a fire station, elementary school, parks, shopping center, golf courseand a business park. All on land that for years has been reserved forindustrial use.;   The Fremont City Council on Tuesday night will evaluate theproject's land-use policy, and its financial and political implications. Amarathon public hearing is expected, and a decision may not be made untilearly Wednesday morning.;   The person at center stage, the one seen castingthe swing vote that could approve or kill the project, is Mayor Bill Ball.Council members Gary Mello and Alane Loisel favor Pacific Greens, whilemembers John Dutra and Gus Morrison oppose it.;   &quot;Everybody assumes it's2-2,&quot; Ball said. &quot;It's a tremendous responsibility for me.&quot;;   Ball said hehas serious questions about Pacific Greens that will have to be answeredTuesday night.;   &quot;I have to get assured in simple lay terms that this isn'tgoing to make a financial impact on the city,&quot; Ball said. &quot;One penny is nogood.&quot;;   The mayor also wants to know specifically where and how many singlefamily homes Catellus will build.;   Opponents of the project, citing a cityeconomic study, say it will place a drain on the city general fund. PacificGreens will cost the city about $600,000 more to service annually for a numberof years than it will contribute in taxes.;   Catellus and city staff havenegotiated a financial package in an effort to compensate for the drain on thecity.;   The company has agreed to use $1.78 million less in cityredevelopment funds to finance more of an auto mall now under construction onthe Pacific Greens site, to pay $5.7 million in developer fees beyond what isrequired of other applicants and assume the city's share of building a firestation in Pacific Greens.;   Catellus has also agreed to set aside 75 condosfor first-time home buyers and 135 apartment units for moderate- to low-incomefamilies.;   City staff and the planning commission, by a 5-2 vote, arerecommending approval of the project.;   Opponents have also expressedconcerns about the project's proximity to the San Francisco Bay WildlifeRefuge, which would border Pacific Greens and the landfill, both west of theproject site. They add that the houses will be isolated from the rest of thecity.;   One underlying issue is whether the city should allow housing in theindustrial zone in the southwest part of town, west of I-880.;   Morrison andothers argue Fremont must hold the industrial land in reserve to provide jobsin the future.;   But Mark Crutcher, the Catellus project director, saidmixing industry, housing and shopping in one area represents &quot; '90s thinking.&quot;He said it will give people a chance to live and work in the same area.;  Under a plan approved in March 1989, the company can build an all-industrialproject of 7.6 million square feet, including office, warehouse and researchand development space; and 165,000 square feet of commercial space.;   ThePacific Greens project would mean 5,300 fewer commute-hour vehicle trips, andless pollution, water use and sewage, than the all-industrial project,according to a city staff report. The new project would add an estimated 839students to the Fremont Unified School District.;   In 1988, Fremont residentsnarrowly approved an advisory measure on a proposal for about 2,345 homes, a75-acre auto mall, a 36-acre park with a lake, 10-acre sports center and $28million in fees to be earmarked for a performing arts center.;   At that timeBall and Mello favored the project, Morrison and then-Councilman John Bakeropposed it, and Dutra was the swing vote.;   But after the election there wereallegations of broken promises by the developer and charges some councilmembers failed to follow the will of the electorate. What emerged was theall-industrial project.;   And, today, with a glut of industrial and officespace, Catellus is once again hoping to get a housing project off the ground.;IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; The Fremont City Council will consider Pacific Greens ata meeting that starts 7 p.m. Tuesday in the council chamber, third floor ofthe city government building, 39700 Civic Center Drive.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DENNIS AKIZUKI, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  775  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, December 2, 199100337185,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
