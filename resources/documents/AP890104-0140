Even before U.S. jets shot down two Libyan fighter planes nearCrete, the Reagan administration had served not-so-subtle notice tothe world that it considers Moammar Gadhafi's drive to producepoison gas _ an allegation the Libyan leader has consistently denied_ a serious threat to world stability.   In the wake of the clash, Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci andother senior U.S. officials sought to separate the incident from thedrumbeat of alarm the Reagan administration has sounded for morethan two months over the facility near the desert town of Rabta,about 40 miles south of Tripoli.   The skirmish is bound to be center-stage at the chemical warfareconference that opens Saturday in Paris. And yet, William Burns, theU.S. arms control director, said ``it is not aimed at bashing aparticular country.''   Referring to the U.S. downing of two Libyan jets, Burns toldreporters at the State Department: ``I don't see it as reallygermane to the conference. I think that other nations will not seeit as germane as well.''   He said the American delegation will focus on trying tostrengthen the authority of United Nations Secretary General JavierPerez de Cuellar to investigate allegations of chemical weapons useand to authorize the U.N. General Assembly or Security Council toimpose sanctions on nations that ``challenge world order.''   Burns conceded, however, this could be difficult since allactions will be taken by consensus. This means a single participant,such as Libya, could hold off an overwhelming majority.   Mindful of the U.S. bombardment of the Libyan capital in April1986, in which 37 persons including an adopted daughter of Gadhafiperished, a sense of foreboding enveloped the conference even beforeforeign ministers and ambassadors from more than 100 countries beganto assemble in the French capital.   It is routine for the United States not to rule out any option,including a military strike. And yet, when President Reagan tookthis familiar stance last month the world took notice. The downingof the two Libyan jets on Wednesday kept attention fastened on theLibyan facility.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz, who flies to Paris onThursday and will hold talks there through Sunday, will concentratehis efforts on the industrialized countries. Charles E. Redman, theState Department spokesman, said the key was to deny Gadhafi theequipment, material and expertise to produce poison gas.   ``If these kind of things are going to be cut off it's going tobe very difficult for a plant of this kind to operate,'' he said.   The 1925 international protocol under review in Paris bans theuse of chemical weapons, but does not outlaw their production. Some20 nations, by U.S. estimate, either have produced chemical weaponsor are capable of manufacturing them.   The protocol has no enforcement mechanism. Its effectivenessdepends on the self-discipline of the 130 nations that are partiesto the pact.   At one time, the civilized world abhorred poison gas. But Iraq,which signed the 1925 agreement, discovered in the Persian Gulf warthat chemical weapons were effective against numerically superiorIranian forces. And some Third World countries resent interferencewith their chemical industries.   To try to stem proliferation, Redman said ``we are prepared todiscuss the strongest possible measures'' against countries thatexport chemical weapons technology.   The West European governments have responded with some skepticismto the U.S. allegations against Libya and its alleged suppliers,however. West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher saidWednesday his government had no evidence proving West Germanpharmaceutical firm had helped build the plant at Rabta. A spokesmanfor Genscher said, meanwhile, Bonn had accused Washington for``additional material'' to back up the allegation.   But the Reagan administration has not pulled back.   Robert M. Gates, a former CIA deputy director who was named lastweek as deputy director of the National Security Council, said in arecent speech that the plant was built with the help of ``nearly adozen nations, East and West.'' He declined to name them.   The United States stopped production of chemical weapons in 1969,then resumed 17 years later on the grounds the Soviet Union andother potential adversaries had chemical weapons programs.Currently, U.S. chemical components and artillery shells to containthem are being produced but stockpiled separately.   The Soviet Union acknowledged in 1987 possession of chemicalweapons, then claimed to have ceased production. A foreign ministryspokesman said 50,000 tons would be stored, the rest destroyed.   Officials of the two countries have held nine sessions in Genevato plan ways to restrict proliferation.   So far, the United States and the Soviet Union are the only twocountries in the world to admit possessing chemical weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
