<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-71-1180 </DOCNO><TEXT>Experimental data allowed to test the most recent calculations on thestability of the trans-einsteinium elements up to element 106, and tomake an estimate on the basis of the {alpha}-transitions observed inthe nuclei with N-Z=48 up to element 109. Calculations have been carriedout and will be presented at this conference. The complete map of themicroscopic corrections for nuclei of the heavy and superheavy elementsis presented. The picture also shows the limit where the liquid dropbarrier drops below the 0.5 MeV of the zero point energy. Nuclei abovethis line are liquid-drop instable. In addition to a minimum at Z=114and Z=178 there appears a local minmum in the ground-state shell correctionat Z=110 and N=162. According to the calculation the nuclei are highlydeformed. Both islands are located in the region of macroscopic instability.The region of new elements comes quite close to this second island, andranges into the region of pure shell stabilization. So they are preventedfrom immediate disintegration only by a narrow shell stabilized fissionbarrier. 29 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
