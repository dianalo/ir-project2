But State Department spokesman Charles Redman said the Timesreport was misleading because a confidential report on which thestory was based does not reflect anticipated sales. He said itconsiders only sales which are ``eligible'' for approval during thecalendar year.   Since U.S. law requires inclusion of all sales that might beapproved, many of which will not take place, ``it would be wrong tocharacterize the report in any way as a sales plan or to attributeany significance to changes in dollar amounts from one year toanother,'' Redman said.   The report cited by the Times, sent by the State Department toCongress, lists potential sales to 33 countries. Israel would get$3.6 billion worth of arms and Egypt $2.7 billion, the Times said.   The request gives more attention to the Persian Gulf region thanrequests of previous years, with the Reagan administration askingfor advanced arms and equipment for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrainand the United Arab Emirates to counter threats from Iran, thenewspaper said.   Elsewhere, one of the biggest possible purchasers is SouthKorea, with a potential $3.3 billion in arms, the report said.   The president is required to submit an arms sale proposal toCongress each year, but the master list has rarely become public.   In the last fiscal year, the United States delivered $11.7billion in military equipment and services to foreign governmentsand $2 billion more was sold directly by manufacturers, accordingto the Defense Department. Arms sales abroad peaked in 1982 at$17.7 billion.   Egypt was the biggest gainer this year, having bought $378million last year, the Times said. Most of that was in tanks, itsaid.   Israel would receive nearly $2.8 million worth of helicoptersand F-16 jet fighters under the proposal, the newspaper said.   Pakistan is listed as a potential buyer of $797 million inequipment this year, compared with $138 million last year.   Military sales to the Philippines would decline to $45 millionfrom $108 million, according to the Times.</TEXT></DOC>
