Cancellation rumors have circulated for weeks, but ABCsteadfastly denied them until Monday, when it issued a statementannouncing the decision.   ABC today said ``Equal Justice,'' a one-hour legal drama aboutthe professional and private lives of prosecutors, will take overthe Wednesday night slot.   ``Cop Rock,'' the bizarre melding of musical and gritty policedrama got weak ratings despite decent reviews.   The statement quoted entertainment president Robert Iger assaying the series' creator, Steven Bochco, ``delivered a daring andbrilliantly produced series, one all of us at ABC are proud to beassociated with.''   Bochco, who also created ``Hill Street Blues'' and ``L.A. Law,''called ``Cop Rock'' the most brilliant thing he's ever done.   ``I've never felt more supported by a network,'' he said. ``Thetruth is, I'm not going to go off and pout. I'm not mad at anybody.We work and live in a very commercial and intensely competitiveworld.''   ``Cop Rock'' made its premiere this fall with a blend of singingcops, a mayor on the take, an officer who dispensed with a copkiller by murdering him and a drug addict who sold her baby for afix.   Since its Sept. 26 debut, the series dropped to the bottom thirdof the A.C. Nielsen Co. rankings.   Asked why viewers did not like the show, Bochco said, ``I don'tknow. It ain't medicine. If they don't like it, you can't forcethem to watch it.''   The executive producer, who also has the hit comedy ``DoogieHowser, M.D.'' on ABC, has a development deal with the network foreight more shows, including an animated, prime-time program fornext year called ``Critters.''   ``Equal Justice,'' which first aired last season as a midseasonreplacement, will return to ABC's schedule on Jan. 9, Iger saidtoday. The series' executive producer, Thomas Carter, won an EmmyAward for directing the pilot episode.</TEXT></DOC>
