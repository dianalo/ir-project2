(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The state House has passed a billrequiring parental consent for unmarried girls under age 18 to havean abortion in Michigan.   The bill passed 65-39 Wednesday after the house rejected nearly50 amendments, including one to require boys to wear condoms toprevent teen-age pregnancy.   It now goes to the Senate, which has passed a similar measureand is expected to take action before lawmakers leave for thewinter holidays next week.   That sets up a promised veto by Gov. James Blanchard, who haspledged to strike down any measure restricting abortion rights.   Opponents of the bill say it is merely intended to make it moredifficult for girls to get an abortion. Planned Parenthoodofficials said at least 70 percent of pregnant minors in Michiganalready bring at least one parent to an abortion clinic with them.   ``This bill is meant to put the squeeze on teen-agers with noregard to the horrible alternatives they may seek,'' said Rep.Maxine Berman, a Democrat. ``Can any of you live with yourself if awoman resorts to a back-alley abortion, or to crack cocaine toinduce abortion, or to suicide? I don't want any more young peopleto die.''   Under the legislation, a pregnant girl could petition a probatecourt to have an abortion if she believes she can't tell a parentor if the parent refuses to let her have an abortion. Permissionwould be required from just one of the parents.   ``We're talking about the very bedrock of our society _family,'' said Democratic Rep. Michael Griffin, the bill's sponsor.``We recognize there are families in trouble, that's why we put thejudicial bypass in there.''   William Kandler, spokesman for Blanchard, said the Democraticgovernor wouldn't change his mind despite a poll by The DetroitNews that said 68 percent of state residents favor a parentalconsent requirement.   ``I'm hopeful the governor will think about parents and not hisown personal beliefs,'' said Barbara Listing, president of Right toLife of Michigan.   Margy Long, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Michigan, saidshe was encouraged by at least 40 signatures collected on the Housefloor asking the governor to veto the bill.   That is more than enough to sustain a veto in the 109-memberHouse, although supporters of the bill say they have enough votesfor an override in the Senate.   Meanwhile, the state Department of Public Health reportedWednesday that the number of abortions in Michigan during the thirdquarter of 1989 fell 23 percent from the same period last year.   The drop comes on the heels of similar declines reportedbeginning in late 1988 with the implementation of a ban onstate-funded Medicaid abortions for poor women.   The 8,696 abortions between July 1 and Sept. 30 compared with11,358 in the same months in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
