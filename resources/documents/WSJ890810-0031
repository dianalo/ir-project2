Also, American Protective Services Inc., Oakland, Calif., which made a $70-a-share bid for Allied, is seeking the Allied shareholder list. The company, which is a competitor in the security guard field, said it wants to communicate with shareholders to inform them of its offer.    On June 19, Neal H. Holmes, chairman and chief executive officer, and Steven B. Stein, president and chief operating officer, made the $53-a-share offer on behalf of a senior management group. About a month later, American Protective offered to acquire Allied &quot;in a merger-type transaction&quot; that would bring shareholders $70 a share in cash.    Mr. Holmes and Mr. Stein, who with their families hold 54% of the company's 489,000 shares outstanding, said they had no interest in any transaction with American Protective, so the Allied board didn't pursue that proposal. Mr. Stein said the group is weighing its options, but isn't considering any transaction with American Protective. </TEXT></DOC>
