Experimental and theoretical results on the formation,equilibrium, stability and confinement properties of these plasmas arepresented. Although they have been known for about three decades, fieldreversed configurations have been studied intensively only in recentyears. This renewed interest is due to the unusual fusion reactor potentialof these high beta plasmas and also to their surprising macroscopic stability.At the present time, field reversed configurations appear to be completelyfree of gross instabilities and show relatively good confinement. Theprimary research goal for the near future is to retain these favourableproperties in a less kinetic regime. Other important issues include thedevelopment of techniques for slow formation and stability, and a clearerassessment of the confinement scaling laws. (author). 416 refs, 37 figs,8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
