A spokesman for Louis Pienaar, the territorial administratorinstalled by South Africa, said the shells fell short of the Etalepolice base, about 20 miles south of the Namibia-Angola border.

Dolf Gouws, territorial police commander, said the mortarshells and a land mine found near the scene were of Soviet origin.He said police officers and U.N. police monitors were investigating.   South Africa has governed Namibia since World War I and agreedto independence as part of a regional accord that also requiresCuban troops to leave neighboring Angola.   The U.N.-supervised independence plan provides for a cease-firebetween South African-led security forces and guerrillas of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization, who began a bush war forindependence in 1966.   In April, about 340 guerrillas and 27 members of the securityforces were killed in fighting that began when SWAPO memberscrossed the border.   South Africa said the incursion violated an agreement that theguerrillas would remain in bases at least 100 miles inside Angolauntil repatriated as unarmed civilians.   More than 5,000 U.N. military and police personnel are in theterritory to monitor the transition and pre-independence electionsscheduled for November.</TEXT></DOC>
