On other markets, livestock and meat futures were mostly higher;grains and soybeans were mixed; and stock-index futures retreated.   Precious metals prices usually follow the oil market closely.Metals traders consider the price of crude oil a good inflationbarometer and gold is considered a good investment hedge againstrising prices.   But Friday's plunge in oil prices created only a moderate stirin the precious metals markets, where sharp declines have beenexpected daily since gold slipped below $400 a troy ounce last week.   Instead of plunging along with oil, gold futures settled only$2.40 to $3.10 lower, indicating the metals market is stronger thanit appeared to be a week ago.   ``Had it not been for oil, the precious metals might have triedto hold their own today,'' said George Anagnos, metals analyst withThomson McKinnon Securities Inc. in New York.   He said the most recent economic statistics, including Friday'sreport of a moderate 0.4 percent rise in the leading economicindicators, indicate inflation may not be as tightly constrained asmany believe.   James Steel, metals analyst with Refco Inc. in New York, saidstrong buying surfaced in the active December gold contract at $400early in the session. Gold for delivery in December rallied to$403.20 before the oil market collapsed and pulled it down to anending price of $399.20.   The spot October gold contract settled at $394.40.   Steel said he remained bearish on gold, but acknowledged that``it's been making rallies; it showed a lot of strength today.''   Peter Cardillo, commodities trading adviser with Josephthal andamp;Co. in New York, said he expected December gold to close above $400early next week.   Silver settled 4 cents to 5.1 cents lower, with December at$6.225 a troy ounce.   Oil prices fell in a selling frenzy sparked by reports that OPECSecretary General Subroto had said Saudi Arabia was increasing itsoil output.   Subroto said the move could send crude-oil prices, which alreadyhave been severely pressured by OPEC overproduction, to as low as$5 a barrel.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 44 cents to 61 centslower with November at $13.37 a barrel; heating oil was 1.28 centsto 1.50 cents lower with October at 38.04 cents a gallon; unleadedgasoline was 1.15 cents lower to 1.47 cents higher with October at47.89 cents a gallon.   Pork futures rallied in a final day of position-squaring aheadof the Agriculture Department's quarterly hogs-and-pigs report,which was released after the close and is expected to spark heavyselling on Monday.   The report's tally of hogs and pigs in the 10 largestpork-producing states was close to pre-report estimates. But themarket was surprised by the larger-than-expected number of pigsthat producers expect to be born from Sept. 1 of this year throughFebruary 1989.   Most traders had expected hog farmers to scale back theirfarrowing intentions because of the drought, resulting in smallersupplies of slaughter-ready hogs next spring and summer, analystssaid.   Live cattle settled .08 cent lower to .65 cent higher withOctober at 71.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to 1.05cents higher with October at 82.45 cents a pound; hogs were .30cent lower to .90 cent higher with October at 39.60 cents a pound;frozen pork bellies were 1.17 cents to the limit 2 cents higherwith February at 52.32 cents a pound.   Wheat futures moved modestly higher but corn, oats and soybeansfinished mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade in cautious tradingahead of the Agriculture Department's report on U.S. grain stocks.   The report, issued after the close, showed soybean stocks as ofSept. 1 at 302 million bushels, down from 655 million in the Junereport and 436 million a year ago. The figure was well above mostpre-report estimates and traders pronounced it slightly bearish forsoybean prices.   The USDA estimated Sept. 1 corn stocks at 4.26 billion bushels,down from 5.83 billion on June 1 and 4.88 billion a year ago.   Wheat stocks as of Sept. 1 were estimated at 2.24 billionbushels, compared with 1.27 billion in June and 2.96 billion a yearago.
