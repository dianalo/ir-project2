Last month, the Red Cross acknowledged it had distributed 24pints of blood that had failed procedures against AIDScontamination or carried hepatitis B antigens, but said that noneof the blood was used and none actually carried the deadly AIDSvirus.   The Food and Drug Administration said the questionable blood wasshipped to hospitals and laboratories by Red Cross centers inWashington and Nashville, Tenn.   Five of the units tested positive for hepatitis B antigens.Initial tests also showed that 10 of the units contained HIVantibodies, which signaled an AIDS danger, but those unitsunderwent a process that breaks down the blood into components forspecific uses and eliminates the virus, the Red Cross said. Theremaining units were from donors who were unacceptable because theypreviously tested ``false positive'' for the AIDS virus, but allthe actual units were tested as safe, officials said.   Investigations into the failure of blood center workers tofollow standard operating procedures are being conducted by the RedCross and the FDA.   The Red Cross said it had begun a five-part program to reducethe chances of human error in the distribution process. The programincludes staff re-education sessions, formal reviews of proceduresto insure consistency with agency regulations, assessment ofpotential for future errors and the strengthening of currentsafeguards to prevent the release of unacceptable blood.   ``Red Cross cannot rest until we have taken every possible stepto avoid errors in the future,'' said Victor W. Schmitt, vicepresident of Red Cross Blood Services.</TEXT></DOC>
