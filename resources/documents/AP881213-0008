(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Indian fugitive Timothy Jacobs, who hasbeen sought on 14 kidnapping charges stemming from a newspapertakeover, was arrested Tuesday in New York after a high-speed chase,authorities said.   Jacobs, 20, was being held at a county jail in Wampsville, N.Y.,25 miles east of Syracuse. He was arraigned as a fugitive Tuesdaynight in Lenox, N.Y., officials said.   North Carolina authorities said they would begin extraditionproceedings, and a lawyer for Jacobs said he would fight the move.   Sgt. Josephine Townsend of the state police in Oneida said policetried to stop Jacobs about 4 p.m. for speeding on the New York StateThruway 10 miles east of Syracuse. Police said Jacobs left thethruway and drove at high speeds through two villages until his carcrashed into an empty school bus. No one was injured.   Jacobs was indicted Dec. 6 during a special session the RobesonCounty grand jury on state charges stemming from the Feb. 1 takeoverof The Robesonian newspaper in Lumberton.   Eddie Hatcher, 31, who was indicted on the same charges, wasarrested on the day the indictments were returned. He has beenreleased on $25,000 bond.   A federal jury in October acquitted Hatcher and Jacobs of federalhostage-taking and firearms charges. During the three-week trial,the two Tuscarora Indians had argued that they had no other choicebut to take over the newspaper to save their lives.   The pair said they had evidence linking county officials and lawenforcement officers to drug trafficking, and that evidence had puttheir lives in jeopardy.   Lewis Pitts, the founder of the Christic Institute South, a civilrights law firm in Carrboro, N.C., that is representing Jacobs, saidJacobs had found a job and delivering a load of arts and craftsmaterial when he was stopped by the trooper.   ``What flashed in front of his eyes ... was the absolute dangerof returning to Robeson County, so he decided to flee,'' Lewis said.   Authorities in North Carolina said Jacobs will be held in the NewYork jail awaiting extradition proceedings. Pitts said Jacobs wouldfight extradition to North Carolina rather than face what he called``blatantly bad-faith prosecution.''</TEXT></DOC>
