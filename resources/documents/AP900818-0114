This was no ordinary class farewell, but a somber one against abackdrop of anti-Semitic violence and the knowledge that if theystayed, they were doomed. They knew they were about to becomerefugees, so they promised one another they would meet again ifthey survived.   On Friday night they did.   They traveled to London from homes in Australia, Israel, theUnited States and England to dine on champagne and Wiener schnitzeland resurrect long-forgotten childhood memories of soccer matchesand Monopoly games at Affi Aufrichtig's house on Heinzelmanngasse,where they met for the last time.   Each dinner place had a card with a nickname _ Affi, Dufschi,Kiwi, Mond _ and a yellowing photo, their last group portraitbefore they fled.   One chair remained empty. Mandel ``Mandi'' Haber disappearedduring World War II, his refugee boat apparently torpedoed by aGerman submarine. His name was by his plate all the same, at thehead of the table.   They were 70 years old now, with wives and grown-up children.They had been friends since the age of six, and still retainedtheir old-world Central European manners and Viennese accents,laced with an American or Australian twang.   Leo Sherwin fled to Shanghai, then settled in Melbourne,Australia. George Kane made it to Sydney, Australia. Ken Hurst, KenMiller and Bert Binder reached England. Affi Aufrichtig, OttoNeugasser and Bobby Postman settled in Israel.   David ``Dufschi'' Rosenbluth, now living in South Nyack, N.Y.,didn't even know until last June that the others were still alive.``I had completely lost track of them,'' he said.   The pact stipulated a reunion outside the Tel Aviv post officeon July 17, 1948, and the three who had reached Israel turned up.Then, through newspaper ads and the International Red Cross, otherswere gradually located. Finally, only Rosenbluth remained to betraced.   Hurst finally tracked him down through the Austrian governmentpension fund, telephoned him in South Nyack and invited him toLondon.   ``When Ken Hurst phoned me, all these things that I hadn'tthought of for 50 years started coming back to me,'' he said,sitting in the Czechoslovak Club where the dinner was held.   ``The street we lived on, where we went to the opera, to soccergames... And now it seems to me as though no time has elapsed atall, because I can see how they were, not how they are. They'restill little boys.''   Hurst became a toolmaker, then a manufacturer of Christmascrackers. Sherwin was an electrician. Rosenbluth opened awatch-repair store in Manhattan, while his parents emigrated toIsrael.   Someone at the reunion remarked that Hitler was dead and theyoungsters he had driven into exile had survived and prospered.Rosenbluth exclaimed: ``And we have a state!'' (Israel).   ``It's great, unbelievable. Sometimes I just can't fathom thethings that are happening,'' he said.   Some of the men have visited Vienna since the war, but say theyfelt no connection to the place. Rosenbluth said he felt anundercurrent of anti-Semitism.   Hurst went back in 1980, having been offered a job there. Herevisited his old house, and the street where the Nazis forced himto clean graffiti off a sidewalk with a toothbrush.   ``I felt like a stranger who spoke the language. I went toschool and grew up there. But I just felt that I didn't belong,''he said.   After six weeks he moved back to England.</TEXT></DOC>
