In particular,we find a rotation of the plane of polarization due to the presence ofthe black hole's spin. The rotation angle is proportional to the massand the line-of-sight component of the angular momentum of the blackhole. This is a general-relativistic effect analogous to the well-knownFaraday rotation.</TEXT></DOC>
