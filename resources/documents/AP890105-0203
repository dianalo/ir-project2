(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The longstanding flow of retirees fromthe Northeast and Midwest to the South's balmier climes is on thedecline, says a University of Florida professor chronicling thetrend.   ``We've come to expect that there will be a continually largeflow of older people moving from the Northeast and Midwest states tothe South. That's become part of our conventional wisdom,'' saysStephen Golant, a University of Florida geography professor. Butthat's starting to change.   Golant, whose study is based on U.S. Census data from 1955 to1985, says that while the 15-state Southern region had a netmigration gain of 280,000 elderly people between 1975-80, the numberof immigrants declined to 208,000 between 1980-85.   Golant, author of ``A Place to Grow Old: The Meaning ofEnvironment in Old Age,'' says one reason for the migration shift isthat the number of ``young-old'' _ people ages 65-74 _ is decliningat a faster rate than their ``old-old'' counterparts.   ``The growth rates for the 65-74 age group in the Northeast andMidwest, which began declining in the mid-1980s, will continue todecline substantially throughout the 1990s and into the first partof the 21st century,'' he said. ``This will reduce the pool ofpotential migrants who might relocate to the South.''   While the 75-plus population will grow at a faster rate than theyoung-old, these rates will still be lower than in the 1970s andearly 1980s.   ``More importantly, the age-75 group has consistently been lesslikely to move from state to state or from region to region,'' hesaid.   One consequence of this graying of the population, Golant said,is that scarce resources may be taxed even further.   ``Since the old-old will represent an increasingly higherproportion of the total elderly population in Florida and otherSouthern states, it's likely that there will be an increased needfor long-term care facilities, home-care facilities, skilled nursingand the like.''   He said there may even be some reverse migration: from the Southback to the Midwest and Northeast.   ``To the extent that states like Florida are not increasing theirhealth care and long-term care facilities, it's reasonable topredict that the more dependent and frail elderly population in theSouth will return to their home states, where they would be closerto their families and to service opportunities,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
