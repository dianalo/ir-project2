Given any (static) state of a power supply system itdetermines whether a malfunction has occurred and, if any exists, whichcorrecting actions can be applied. Actually, a first version of EXPOis installed as a training. EXPO is implemented as a rule-based system.It is mainly written in Prolog and, therefore, takes advantage of mostfeatures of Prolog, like, for example, its inference mechanism. The userinterface is menu-driven and offers a graphical representation of thestate of the power supply system. A knowledge acquisition component allowsan easy integration of new knowledge as additional rules or new equipment.The explanation component supports a 'quasi-natural' communication withthe user.</TEXT></DOC>
