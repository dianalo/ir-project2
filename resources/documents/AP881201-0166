PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Lawyers for G.D. Searle andamp; Co. asked ajudge Thursday for a new trial after a jury awarded $8.15 million toa woman who said the Copper-7 intrauterine device caused aninfection that left her infertile.   A new trial should be granted because jurors were prejudiced byinformation taken into the jury room by the jury foreman and othermembers of the jury, said Paul Strain, attorney for theChicago-based pharmaceutical company.   According to affidavits filed by three jurors, the jury foremansmuggled a newspaper story about the trial into the jury room andread it aloud, defying a court order. Jurors also talked aboutdefinitions from a medical dictionary, which also had been forbiddenby Judge Robert Renner.   ``Never has there been such evidence of extraneous prejudicialinfluence in any case,'' Strain said.   The jury said Searle's negligence in testing and its intentionalmisrepresentations in marketing the Copper-7 led to the plaintiff'ssterility. But jurors also determined that Searle was not negligentin its design or manufacture of the Copper-7.   During the trial, attorneys for the plaintiff, Esther Kociemba,sought to establish that Searle knew of potential health risks withthe Copper-7, but did not adequately disclose those risks to doctorsor the public.   After hearing arguments, the judge took the case under advisement.   It was the first time a jury awarded punitive damages againstSearle for a Copper-7-related illness and it was the largest award.   About 500 lawsuits have been filed over the Copper-7, the mostwidely used IUD in the United States before it was withdrawn fromthe U.S. market in January 1986. Searle won 14 of the previous 17cases to be decided.   Strain also argued that the jury was coerced into reaching acomplete verdict after returning Sept. 9 with an incomplete juryform.   Jurors, who had deliberated almost 10 days, answered only sevenof the 17 questions and U.S. Magistrate Jan Symchych, sitting in forRenner, instructed them to return to the jury room to complete theform. The jurors completed the form and returned with the verdict ashort time later.   Strain said Symchych did not have the legal authority to givejury instructions and said she coerced the jury into giving averdict because she did not offer them the alternative of comingback as a hung jury.   Roger Brosnahan, an attorney for the plaintiff, said the jury hadalready decided the case but inadvertently neglected to fill in 10of the 17 answer blanks. He said Symchcych's instructions fellwithin the ``administerial'' powers of her role as a replacement forRenner.   The alleged jury misconduct came to light after jurors werequestioned by Searle attorneys following the verdict. Three of thejurors wrote a letter to Renner, saying they were ashamed to beassociated with a verdict that did not represent their true feelings.   Searle lawyers also disputed arguments that Searle be required topay the attorney fees of Mrs. Kociemba, 30, of Elk River, Minn. Theysaid the fees of about $3 million were ``wildly outreaching.''   Michael Ciresi, attorney for Mrs. Kociemba, said Searle should berequired to pay the fees under the Minnesota Consumers ProtectionAct. He said his Minneapolis law firm took the case partly as apublic service.</TEXT></DOC>
