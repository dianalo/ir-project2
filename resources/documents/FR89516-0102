The amendments were effective as of the date of issuance forUnit 1 and on November 1, 1989 for Unit 2.The amendments modified the Technical Specifications relating to the designand operation of the Point Beach fuel cycle with upgraded core featuresand higher core power peaking factors (F<T2>Q</T2> and F-delta H) than previously permitted by the plant TechnicalSpecifications.Specifically, the amendments incorporate higher core power peaking factorswhich allow the use of a low-low leakage loading pattern (L4P) fuel managementstrategy and will result in decreased neutron fluence to the reactor vessel.This fluence reduction will help address reactor vessel irradiation damageissues such as pressurized thermal shock, low upper shelf material toughnessand pressure-temperature restrictions on heatup and cooldown. The highercore power peaking factors allow additional fluence reduction measures,such as the use of peripheral power suppression assemblies, to be pursued.In addition to the increase in core power peaking factors, the changesand reanalysis supporting them permit the use of an upgraded fuel productfeatures package. The upgraded fuel product features include: removabletop nozzles, integral fuel burnable absorbers, axial blankets, extendedburnup geometry, and inclusion of a debris filter bottom nozzle. The reactorcore description was modified to reflect these changes. Further, theseamendments allow the removal of the fuel assembly thimble plugging devicesand the elimination of the third line segment of the K(z) curve.The application for the amendments complies with the standards and requirementsof the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act), and the Commission'srules and regulations. The Commission has made appropriate findings asrequired by the Act and the Commission's rules and regulations in 10 CFRChapter I, which are set forth in the license amendments.Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendments and Opportunity for Hearingin connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 6, 1988 (53 FR 49260) and February6, 1989 (54 FR 5707). No request for a hearing or petition for leave tointervene was filed following this notice.The Commission has prepared an Environmental Assessment related to theaction and has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statement.Based upon the environmental assessment, the Commission has concluded thatthe issuance of these amendments will not have a significant effect onthe quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendments dated August 26, 1988; as supplemented October 28, November30, and December 23, 1988 and as modified January 17, 1988 (sic), (2) AmendmentNo. 120 to License No. DPR-24, (3) Amendment No. 123 to License No. DPR-27,and (4) the Commission's related Safety Evaluation and Environmental Assessment.All of these items are available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street NW., and at the JosephP. Mann Library, 1516 Sixteenth Street, Two Rivers, Wisconsin.
