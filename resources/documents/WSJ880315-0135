Strong sales of men's clothing were cited.    In the year-ago period, the specialty fashion retailer had net income of $3.3 million, or 34 cents a share. Sales for the latest quarter rose 20% to $79 million from $65.9 million the year earlier, the company said.    So far, fiscal 1989 is off to a &quot;slow start,&quot; Michael D. Sullivan, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview. &quot;But we're still optimistic it will be a good year,&quot; he added.    Same-store sales are down slightly from last year, and the outlook for women's clothing continues to be sluggish, Mr. Sullivan said.    More than compensating for a decline in demand for women's apparel, however, were men's casual outfits, which sold well throughout the year.    For all of fiscal 1988, Merry-Go-Round expects to report a 33% increase in earnings to $10 million, or $1.05 a share, compared with net of $7.5 million, or 79 cents a share, in fiscal 1987. Sales rose 23% to about $255 million from $207 million, the company estimated. Per-share figures have been adjusted to reflect a 3-for-2 stock split paid in May 1987.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Merry-Go-Round shares closed at $10.75, unchanged. </TEXT></DOC>
