Spiegel froma government demand to immediately deposit $19 million in anescrow account, dealing the Office of Thrift Supervision atleast a temporary setback in its landmark case against theformer Columbia Savings andamp; Loan Association executive.   Columbia, based in Beverly Hills, Calif., is currentlyinsolvent, reflecting roughly $1 billion in losses andwrite-downs of its once lucrative junk-bond portfolio,developed over the years because of a close relationshipbetween Mr. Spiegel and former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.junk-bond exponent Michael Milken. Columbia is currentlyattempting to sell the bonds to minimize further losses,although most people believe the government will eventuallyseize the thrift.</LP><TEXT>   Federal Judge Stephen Wilson agreed to agovernment-requested freeze of the assets of Mr. Spiegel andhis wife and ordered Mr. Spiegel to post a $1 million bond bythis Wednesday. The order allows the couple to continuepaying reasonable living expenses but subjects singleexpenditures of more than $5,000 to government review andpossible court challenge.   Last week, the OTS alleged in an administrative complaintthat Mr. Spiegel improperly diverted $19 million in fundsbelonging to Columbia for such disparate personal uses asairplanes, condominiums, guns and concert tickets. Theaction, believed to be the largest attempt to obtainrestitution from a thrift executive, also sought a $5 millioncivil penalty against Mr. Spiegel. Originally, the OTS hadordered Mr. Spiegel to meet the escrow demand by noon PDTlast Friday.   At a Friday court hearing, however, lawyers for Mr.Spiegel argued that the law under which the OTS wasproceeding didn't authorize the agency to obtain funds inadvance of a hearing, especially where the individual beingattacked wasn't any longer an employee of the institution anda direct threat to its financial well-being. Mr. Spiegelresigned as Columbia's president and chief executive officerlast December and as a consultant in May.   &quot;Congress intended to give the OTS authority to issuethese kinds of extraordinary orders when it was necessary toprotect the financial integrity of a thrift. That {authority}does not exist when you have a former officer,&quot; assertedDennis Perluss, a Los Angeles lawyer for Mr. Spiegel.   While deferring final judgment on the ultimate legalquestions, Judge Wilson said there were enough grounds totemporarily enjoin the government from requiring the $19million escrow because &quot;this case clearly raises seriousquestions and that the balance of hardships tips sharply inplaintiff's favor,&quot; according to his order. He set a hearingfor July 30 to consider Mr. Spiegel's request for a furtherpreliminary injunction.   An OTS spokesman said the government was nonethelesspleased with the financial restraints that the judge imposedon Mr. Spiegel.</TEXT></DOC>
