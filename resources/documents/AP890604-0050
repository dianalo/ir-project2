Although partisan politics and increasing media scrutinycontributed mightily to the atmosphere that impelled House SpeakerJim Wright and Democratic Whip Tony Coelho to announce theirresignations, their underlying difficultly stemmed from allegations_ formal or otherwise _ that they violated or may have violatedHouse rules on outside income.   Those rules clearly allow various types of outside income. Theyare much less clear in defining what counts and doesn't count as aviolation.   In Wright's case, for example, he did not deny his financialpast. Indeed, the charges were based largely on information hereported on public disclosure forms. What Wright argued was thathis actions did not constitute a violation of the rules. Hisaccusers maintained otherwise.   Without question, members of Congress can accept campaigncontributions from special interest political action committees,can take trips to exotic resorts paid for by special interests andcan accept cash for speeches. Those who have been around longenough can even convert campaign contributions to personal use aslong as they pay tax on the money.   Congress allowed various income supplements to continue even inthe post-Watergate era of reform _ so long as they were disclosedand did not exceed certain limits. The philosophy was that eachmember's constituents would get a chance to decide at the pollseach two years whether they approved of the way theirrepresentative was conducted his or her financial affairs.   There was considerable support in the House earlier this yearfor proposals to ban speaking fees and other outside earned incomein exchange for an across-the-board pay raise.   But there was an intense public outcry against a pay raise _initially a 50 percent boost that would raise salaries from $89,000to $135,000 _ and there was little support for banning honorariawithout a salary increase to compensate for what, in effect, wouldbe a pay cut for many members.   On top of the ethics charges already brewing against him, Wrightcame under criticism from outsiders for appearing to be trying toengineer the raise without a vote and _ privately _ from some ofhis colleagues for not trying hard enough to get the raise throughwithout a vote.   Wright had believed the 50 percent pay raise was too large andeventually favored having the House vote on a 30 percent increase.But the vast majority of members didn't want to be recorded asvoting for any pay raise.   Then came the wrenching partisan political battle over PresidentBush's nomination of former Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, to besecretary of defense. Tower was defeated, and fellow Wright, afellow Texan, complained after his own downfall that he had beenvictimized by vengeance-seeking Republicans.   Congressional Republicans were eager to exploit the Wrightethics problem because Democrats had tried to use the so-called``sleaze issue'' against Republicans during the 1988 presidentialcampaign, referring often to the many Reagan administrationofficials who had run afoul of executive branch ethics rules.   ``Some people have said that the (ethical) standards havechanged,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Common Cause, theself-styled citizens lobby. ``That is not the case. What hashappened is that standards that have existed for years are nowbeing enforced _ standards that for too long had not been paidattention to.''   Wertheimer said that while salary increases are ``greatlyneeded,'' the more pressing need is for Congress to cleanse itselfof special-interest influence. ``The way of life on Capitol Hillhas to be changed so that the money chase is ended. You havemembers of Congress right now who live off special interests, bothprofessionally and personally.''   Norman Ornstein, a political analyst with the private AmericanEnterprise Institute, said Congress would not be likely to solvethe problem by coupling a pay raise with a prohibition on speakingfees and other special interest money. But he suggested such a movemight be worth trying in the present circumstance.   ``You'd still get (consumer activist) Ralph Nader going bananasand radio talk show hosts going ballistic,'' he said, ``but I dothink the public would eventually accept it.''   John F. Banzhat, a George Washington University law professor,said that while he doesn't believe members of Congress areunderpaid, there has to be a dramatic change in the system _ evenif that means a pay increase.   ``What they're doing is taking payola,'' he said. ``We told discjockeys at radio stations years ago that they couldn't do that, andcongressmen still do.''   He said that while Congress has shown itself more sensitive toethical problems in recent years, its rules of conduct oftenamounted merely to ``fine-tuning the amount of payola they couldtake.''   In the meantime, members of Congress vent their frustrationspublicly and Republicans and Democrats engage in what Ornsteincalled a congressional adaptation of the war between the Hatfieldsand the McCoys.   ``Politics is a blood sport and an unforgiving business,'' saidRep. James Slattery, D-Kan. ``The reality is _ and you know thisgoing in _ you can make a mistake even after 30 or 40 years ofservice and your career can end.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE: Merrill Hartson is chief of the AP congressional</NOTE><TEXT>   staff.</TEXT></DOC>
