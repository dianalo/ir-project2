DRISCOLL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   For the first time, federal prosecutors havebrought racketeering charges against a lawyer accused of insidertrading and said they would use the law more in the future to crackdown on financial wrongdoing.   Attorney Alfred Elliott was one of 12 people indicted Tuesday bya federal grand jury for alleged financial crimes.   ``This is the first time in history we've used the racketeeringstatute in an insider trading case,'' said U.S. Attorney AntonValukas.   Elliott, now of Melbourne Beach, Fla., was accused of making$680,000 in illegal profits by using information he obtained whenhe was a partner of the Schiff, Hardin andamp; Waite law firm in Chicago.   ``He misappropriated the confidential information of his firmand of the clients,'' said Valukas.   On nine occasions, Elliott learned of large pending stockacquisitions by clients, then invested heavily in the company whosestock was being bought, the government alleged.   The racketeering statute provides greater penalties and givesthe government greater power to seize illicit gains than other lawsprohibiting insider trading, Valukas said.   ``In the future, we expect to use the racketeering laws as apowerful weapon in these cases,'' Valukas said.   Elliott is charged in the 70-count indictment with wire fraud,securities fraud, racketeering and filing a false income taxreturn. If convicted on all counts, he could be fined $13.5 millionand forced to make restitution of any illegal profits.   Elliott, 44, could not be located for comment. Directoryassistance for Melbourne Beach had no listing for him and hisformer law firm said it had no knowledge of his whereabouts.   Eight of the 12 people indicted Tuesday were accused in aseparate $1.2 million scheme of churning accounts, a practice ofbrokers trading on customers' accounts merely to generatecommissions.   Valukas said none of the 120 customers involved ever made aprofit.   The government alleged the scheme was carried out by officersand employees of Whitehall Investors International Inc., based inChicago with branches in Irvine, Calif., and Boca Raton, Fla.   Those indicted include Walter S. Josten, an owner and presidentof Whitehall, who could face 105 years in prison if convicted.   Josten's last known residence was in Los Angeles, but directoryassistance had no listing for him.   Indictments also were returned against three people in anongoing investigation of trading at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.   They are accused of participating in fraudulent tradinginvolving Jeffrey G. Donnelly, a former broker with CRT ServicesInc. Donnelly pleaded guilty of two counts of fraud in February andwas sentenced to three years in prison.   The government said Donnelly would take successful trades heexecuted for his company and make it appear that the trades hadbeen made for one of the three independent traders indicted onTuesday.   Valukas said more than $700,000 was diverted illegally to thedefendants, while Donnelly got a 35 percent cut.   Indicted were Denise Bigelow, 29, who the government said had$142,500 illegally diverted to her account; John D. Riss, 29,$390,727; and Paul M. Kelly, 35, $180,000. All are from the Chicagoarea.   Conviction would carry a maximum 10-year prison sentence and a$750,000 fine.</TEXT></DOC>
