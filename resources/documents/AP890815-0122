President Bush adopted a conciliatory tone, saying in Washingtonthe Iranians have it in their power to get American hostagesreleased and rejoin the ``family of law abiding'' nations.   Sixteen Westerners are missing in Lebanon, including eightAmericans, and most are believed held by Shiite groups loyal to Iran.   Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, thought to be amongthe ``pragmatists'' led by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, said talkswith the Syrians ``will not have anything to do with the hostageissue since this issue does not concern us.'' He spoke to reportersafter meeting with Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.   Official media in Damascus indicated, however, that PresidentHafez Assad and other Syrian leaders were pressing the Iranians foraction on the hostages. Syria was Iran's main Arab ally in itseight-year war with Iraq, in which a truce was reached a year ago.   Velayati said Israel must free the pro-Iranian cleric, SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, without conditions.   Israel kidnapped Obeid from south Lebanon on July 28. It hasoffered to trade him and hundreds of other Lebanese Shiite prisonersfor three Israeli soldiers held captive in Lebanon and the Westernhostages.   Bush said in Washington: ``We don't have to be hostile with Iranfor the rest of our lives. We've had a good relationship with themin the past. They're of strategic importance. They'd be welcome backinto the family of law-abiding, non-terrorist-sponsoring nations.''   He said the best signal Iran could give the United States of itsintention to improve relations would be to bring about the releaseof the Americans.   ``I think that if Iran decided they wanted those hostages to comeout of there, there would be a good likelihood that that wouldhappen,'' Bush said.   In another apparent signal to Tehran, the United States told theWorld Court it would be willing to participate in a suit brought byIran over the shooting down of an Iranian passenger plane in July1988 by a U.S. Navy ship in the Persian Gulf.   Velayati, who arrived Monday for talks on the fighting betweenSyrians and Chrstians in Lebanon, said: ``We hope Sheik Obeid willbe released. This release should take place without any priorconditions _ no talks, no discussions before Sheik Obeid isreleased.''   Syria has been instrumental in past hostage releases and haspromised Washington to help resolve the crisis surrounding Obeid'sabduction.   After talks with the foreign minister, Velayati met with Assadand delivered a letter from Rafsanjani, who has indicatedflexibility on the hostage issue since his inauguration the dayObeid was kidnapped. The contents were not disclosed.   Accompanying Velayati to Damascus was one of his deputies,Hussein Sheikholeslam, a hard-liner with close links to Hezbollah,or Party of God, the group thought to sponsor Shiite kidnap gangs inLebanon.   Sheikholeslam was a leader of Iranian militants who stormed theU.S. Embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and held 52 Amricans hostagefor 444 days.   Velayati also met in Damascus with Hezbollah leaders, includingSheik Mohammad Hussein Fadlallah, the movement's spiritual adviser.Fadlallah said Friday that all hostages should be freed.   Britain asked Iran to release businessman Roger Cooper afternearly four years of detention so he can attend his mother's funeralSaturday. Cooper, 53, was detained in November 1985 for overstayinghis visa and later was accused of spying, but no charges have beenfiled. His mother died Aug. 3.   Tehran newspapers denounced the United States on Tuesday.   Kayhan International, an English-language daily, said for Bush to``pin hopes on Iran's assistance'' to free the hostages ``withoutrespecting Tehran's conditions is wishful thinking.''   It said Iran rejects indirect talks through Pakistan, an Islamicneighbor with which Tehran is forging new links, because ofWashington's ``insolent tone.''   Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan of Pakistan was scheduledto arrive in Tehran on Wednesday for a three-day visit.   Kayhan said the release of billions of dollars in Iranian assetsthe United States froze in 1979 would ``be taken only as a goodwillgesture,'' not as an trade-off for help in freeing the hostages.   Abrar, a radical daily, said: ``The return of Iranian assets andproperties is the indisputable and lawful right of the Islamicrepublic and is not something to be bargained over.''   Last week, the English-language Tehran Times said Iran would bewilling to help free the hostages if the assets were released.</TEXT></DOC>
