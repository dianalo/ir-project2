Among those summoned to the White House for an unusual Saturdayworking session were Secretary of State James A. Baker III, TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, Chiefof Staff John Sununu, National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft andnewly confirmed Defense Secretary Richard Cheney.   Bush is considering a proposed joint venture with the Japanesefor production in Japan of a new version of the F-16 jet fighter,called the FSX.   Bush on Saturday laughed and waved off a question on whether hehad made a decision about the project when he happened upon a smallgroup of reporters who were chatting with first lady Barbara Bush atthe White House.   In remarks to reporters on Friday he sought to play down earliersuggestions that a basic commitment had been made to the project,with only details remaining to be worked out.   Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush called his team to theWhite House Saturday because ``he wanted to review some of thetechnical issues.''   He said Bush's decision probably would come ``early next week.''   Bush has been studying data on the controversial proposal, whichcritics say would give the Japanese advanced U.S. technical data, amove that would undercut the U.S. industrial and trade base.   Bush's advisers are known to be divided on the merits of thedeal. Mosbacher has taken the lead in raising concerns overcommercial and technological implications of the agreement, whichwas negotiated by the Pentagon and State Department.   Under the U.S.-Japan deal initialed late last year, St.Louis-based General Dynamics would join forces with Japan'sMitsubishi Heavy Industries to co-develop and co-produce thenext-generation fighter.   Proponents argue the agreement represents the best deal theUnited States could negotiate in the face of Japanese opposition tobuying F-16s directly from the United States. They say the dealwould serve to promote beneficial technology transfer in bothdirections while generating income and jobs for U.S. industry.   But critics contend the tentative arrangement amounts to agiveaway of advanced technology that Japan may use to help propelits civilian aircraft industry into head-to-head competition withthe United States in the world market. They say Tokyo shouldpurchase American-made planes to help offset the $50 billion U.S.trade deficit with Japan.   While the president worked and played tennis and horseshoes on abalmy afternoon, first lady Barbara Bush was preoccupied with herdog Millie's new litter, born Friday night and early Saturday.   By the time Mrs. Bush was ready to play tennis with Supreme CourtJustice Sandra Day O'Connor at mid-afternoon, the sky had cloudedand a blustery rain was falling.   But Mrs. Bush said the family had lunch at poolside earlier.   Bush had said Friday that he was eager to ``unleash all theathletic events'' for the weekend at the White House.   His new horseshoe pit was to be formally opened in a couple ofweeks with what Bush called a ``very big gala opening'' featuringhorseshoe pitchers from across the country.   Bush said he was also expecting to pick up his outdoor runningagain. He has been using an indoor treadmill. He said he had a``hiatus'' from his usual two-mile jog in recent weeks because hehad the flu.</TEXT></DOC>
