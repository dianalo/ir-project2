Jefferson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> NOC FREST </CO><IN> ARO </IN><G> DEF JUS </G><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two shareholder derivative suits were filed on behalf of Northrop Corp. against 38 current and former Northrop officials, directors and outside consultants, charging them with massive and continual wrongdoing in connection with almost all of the aerospace concern's major defense programs.    Nearly all of Northrop's well-publicized problems with defense contracting and payments to South Korea over the past several years are mentioned in the suits, which charge the defendants with breach of fiduciary duties and violations of various California statutes. The suits, which also name Northrop as a nominal defendant, seeks unspecified damages to be paid to Northrop and the repayment of all salaries and other compensation.    The legal actions, which are substantially the same, were filed in state court here by Northrop shareholders Rodney Shields and Gabrielle U. Mayran. A total of five law firms in four cities represent the two shareholders. The lead firm on both cases is Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie andamp; Lerach, of San Diego, Calif., which specializes in shareholder suits.    &quot;For a number of years, defendants have been engaging in a course of illegal conduct in attempting to sell Northrop's F-20 Tigershark fighter aircraft to the South Korean government and to obtain, retain and perform defense contracts relating to the MX Missile, the B-2 Stealth Bomber, the Cruise Missile, the Tacit Rainbow Missile and the all-service target and reconnaissance aircraft in violation of state and federal law,&quot; the suits allege.    Commenting on the litigation for the company and its officers and directors, a Northrop spokesman said, &quot;The suits appear largely to be a recitation of newspaper articles on various assertions that already are under investigation by Northrop or by the government with Northrop's cooperation. Some of the matters are already in litigation.&quot;    The defendants include Thomas V. Jones, Northrop's chairman and chief executive officer; Kent Kressa, president and chief operating officer; 12 other company directors; 21 current and former Northrop executives and employees; and three outside consultants, William Galvin and William Parkin, both of whom figure prominently in the government's recently disclosed two-year investigation into Pentagon procurement corruption; and Jimmy Shin, who was a Northrop consultant in its dealing with South Korea.    Messrs. Shin, Galvin and Parkin couldn't be reached last night for comment on the shareholders' suits.    The suits claim that certain of the defendants &quot;who were aware of the . . . illegal conduct&quot; because of their positions at the company, sold a total of 361,545 Northrop shares for $13.1 million between 1984 and 1988, and that the prices they received -- as high as $52 a share -- were artificially inflated because the &quot;alleged illegalities&quot; hadn't been disclosed.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Northrop closed yesterday at $29.50 a share, down 37.5 cents.    Highlighted in the suits is Northrop's involvement with alleged payoffs to South Korean officials. The suits allege that to salvage its troubled F-20 Tigershark fighter plane, on which the company spent more than $1.2 billion without making a single sale, Northrop officials allowed &quot;the illegal use of Northrop's funds to improperly influence officials of foreign governments in an effort to cause their governments to purchase&quot; the fighters.    A grand jury last month began investigating whether Northrop and Mr. Jones violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in making about $7.8 million in payments to entities controlled by an individual close to high officials in the South Korean government.    The executive committee of Northrop's board also has been looking into the payments made in 1984 and 1986, which Northrop officials have claimed were intended to build a hotel in Seoul. The hotel was never built, and the suits describe the situation as a &quot;bogus/sham joint venture.&quot;    The suits also charge the defendants with &quot;incompetence and mismanagement&quot; and falsification of data in relation to Northrop's production of guidance systems for the MX nuclear missile. Frustrated employees in 1986 appeared in congressional hearings to bring charges that the company's production of the systems was faulty. The problems have been the subject of a Justice Department investigation and employee lawsuits, and Northrop forfeited a minority of its missile-production work this year to Rockwell International Corp., El Segundo, Calif.    As for Northrop's $42 billion, ultra-secret B-2 Stealth bomber program, which has been said to be greatly over budget, the suits allege that the defendants submitted false billings, overstated the so-called earned value on the government contract and misrepresented certain tests and work on the aircraft.    The suits also charge that Northrop, aided by its consultants, has in the past wrongfully obtained information from the Defense Department about the performance of its existing contracts and information about future potential contracts. In June, a Northrop division was searched as part of the government investigation. </TEXT></DOC>
