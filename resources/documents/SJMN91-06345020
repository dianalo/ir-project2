I'd be surprised if it would happen.;  &quot;We have been here several days and had one conversation with the Yankees. Iwouldn't say we're any closer to making a trade with them than we were beforewe talked to them.&quot;;   Moving out of Oakland might not upset Canseco too much.He said during the past season that he didn't think he was fully appreciatedby the Oakland fans. And his relationship with Athletics manager Tony La Russahas been stormy at times.;   But Canseco to New York?;   The Yankees certainlycould use a star on and off the field to help them compete with the New YorkMets. The Mets recently signed Bobby Bonilla and are grabbing more attentionwith trade talks with California about Chuck Finley.;   The Yankees, however,haven't been able to do much of anything in the off-season. They couldn't evenfigure out whether or not to bring free agent Steve Buechele to New York for atour of the area.;   And it's uncertain whether they would be willing to puttogether a big enough package to get Canseco.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Miami Beach, Fla.  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911210  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  254  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, December 10, 199100345020,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
