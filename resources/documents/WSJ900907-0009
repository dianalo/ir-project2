The British chemical and pharmaceuticals company said therestructuring will involve creating a new Brussels-basedorganization, ICI Europe, to oversee ICI businessesthroughout the 12-nation community and a few other Europeancountries. Six regional groupings of ICI's Europeanoperations will replace the current 15 national ones.</LP><TEXT>   Tom Hutchison, the company's executive directorresponsible for Europe, said the move is aimed at cuttingcosts and providing better customer service. The companydidn't give any figures on how much it hopes to save and howmany jobs might be eliminated. It said it hopes job losseswill be minimal, considering the further growth it expects inEurope.   Mr. Hutchison said ICI's many acquisitions in Europeduring the 1980s left the company with new units that aren'twell integrated into the corporate structure. &quot;We need torealign and simplify our organization,&quot; he said.   The new structure, to be in place by 1992, would eliminatecurrent anomalies such as having three ICI companies sellingthe same products on the same market, sometimes even to thesame customer, Mr. Hutchison said.   The move is unlikely to have a major effect on thecompany's profitability, according to Richard Henderson, ananalyst at Nomura Securities in London. Mr. Hendersen calledthe reorganization &quot;a step in a very sensible direction&quot; thatwill transcend national boundaries where necessary or logicaland that should &quot;shake up&quot; the company's large bureaucracy.</TEXT></DOC>
