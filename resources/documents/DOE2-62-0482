The models and results of thisanalysis provide valuable insights for policy-makers in this field. Thefirst section of this thesis estimates the relevant elasticities of substitutionbetween capital and electricity for nine UK industrial groupings. Thisempirical work applies two-tier translog neo-classical cost functions.Both static and dynamic models are estimated. The first section's resultsindicate that the economic relationship between capital and electricityvaries substantially across industrial sectors. These differences reflecthow particular electric technologies have diffused within industries.It follows that an economic analysis of the development of industrial,electrically-powered, equipment markets will provide valid indicationsfor the growth of industrial electricity. The second section of the thesisconsists of such an analysis. Survey evidence suggests that industrialelectrical equipment is sought for reasons other than running cost efficiency,is particular final output quality improvements, and that it is not superiorto rival processes for all firms within an industry.</TEXT></DOC>
