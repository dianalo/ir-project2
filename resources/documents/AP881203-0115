The agreement, reached Friday with state officials, calls forAvtex Fibers Inc. to comply with water quality laws, make its plantsafer for workers and pay $2 million in civil fines to the town ofFront Royal.   ``We recognized the importance of the plant, with its 1,300 jobsand the roles it plays in the space program and the nationalsecurity,'' said state Attorney General Mary Sue Terry.   ``But our primary duty was to safeguard the environment andprotect the workers, of Front Royal, and of the commonwealth. Toaccomplish that objective, we had to take a hard line.''   Avtex spokesman Nick Nichols said Avtex managers were pleased toput the lawsuits behind them. ``They now intend to go forward withtheir business and take care of the various issues in these twodecrees,'' he said in a telephone interview from Washington.   There was no answer Saturday at Avtex Chairman John N. Gregg'shome.   The agreement, filed in two consent degrees in circuit courts inRichmond and Warren County, includes $10 million in civil penaltiesif the company fails to comply.   The agreement settles two lawsuits field by the attorneygeneral's office. One filed for the Department of Labor and Industryasked that Avtex be ordered to make certain repairs at the plant.   The other lawsuit sought $19.7 million and was filed Nov. 2 onbehalf of the state Water Control Board for violations of thecompany's national pollution discharge elimination permit. Avtexclosed the plant the next day, then reopened a week later after NASAand the Pentagon guaranteed about $40 million in contracts.   Avtex, the sole supplier of a type of rayon used in the spaceshuttle, agreed to reduce employee exposure to carbon disulfide gas.The chemical is used to make rayon and can cause a variety ofailments, some fatal.
