(fueling telecommunicationservices with fiber)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Runyon, Paul.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Feeder plants require higher bit rates in order to support theirtelephone companies' provision of new services and increasedcapacity.andP;  As a result, over half of the new feeder and loopplants are using fiber optic cables.andP;  Current configurations ofasynchronous networks above DS3 speeds do get higher bit ratescloser to the end user but use proprietary interfaces and networkmanagement functions.andP;  A future alternative, the Sonet standard,will ease the transition from an asynchronous to a synchronousnetwork and will provide direct mapping without demultiplexing.andO;Phase I has already established a Sonet definition for opticalrates and formats, and Phase 2 will enhance standard messages andprotocols in support of remote provisioning.andP;  Interfaces on earlySonet products will accommodate existing operating systems.andO;Multiplexers and transmission equipment complying to Sonet arealready being announced.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber opticsTelephone companiesStandardsNetwork ManagementCablesFuture TechnologiesInterface.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Asynchronous network.
