Saul Claveria, deputy police chief in San Jose Province, saidthe publisher became ineligible to duel when he announced last weekhe would show up at the planned confrontation, but not actuallyfight.   ``He who refuses to take up arms will not fight, and hisadversary would be a vulgar assassin and would lose the conditionof honorable duelist,'' said Claveria through his attorney, AriostoFernandez.   He is ``not worthy of the gentlemanly pursuit,'' Fernandez said.   The publisher, Federico Fasano, was advised of Claveria'sdecision Sunday and said the matter ``has ended.''   Fasano is director of the small leftist daily La Republica inMontevideo. Claveria challenged Fasano to a duel, permitted by lawin Uruguay, in a disagreement over a story in La Republica.   The Jan. 24 investigative story on the smuggling of consumermerchandise reported that two cars involved in distributingcontraband were registered to Claveria.   Claveria said the cars had belonged to the police department,and that he had only signed legal papers connected to their salemonths ago. The vehicles apparently now belong to a car rentalagency.   Fasano claimed his reporters worked ``correctly and ethically''in writing the smuggling story.   Claveria challenged Fasano to a duel, and the challenge receivedheavy media coverage, both in Fasano's paper and others.   Claveria retired from the Montevideo police department afterreaching the post of inspector, one of the highest, and accepted anew post in San Jose, 30 miles east of the capital.   Dueling in this small South American nation is regulated by a1939 law that requires seconds, or colleagues of the two men in adispute, to try to reach a solution. Failing that, they mustdesignate a three-member tribunal to arrange a duel site,witnesses, doctors and other details.   If a participant is killed in an encounter that meets all therules, the other duelist is exempt from punishment.</TEXT></DOC>
