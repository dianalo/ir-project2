You walk up a stairway ina Soviet building and none of the steps are the same. They can'teven finish a floor flat, things you and I take for granted,'' saidMark Hungerford, chairman and chief executive officer of TansciscoIndustries Inc. of San Francisco, a rail car company.   ``They can get rockets to the moon, so it's not like they'reincapable, but they've never focused on these things before,''Hungerford said.   He is one of 15 chief executive officers of U.S. companiesscheduled to leave for Moscow on Saturday for a week-long visit todiscuss what kind of ``technical assistance'' the United States cangive the Soviet Union.   Mosbacher and the business leaders are set to leave on the eveof President Bush's summit with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev. The administration said Wednesday that it would take afresh look at economic aid for the Soviet Union in light ofMoscow's ``real and very helpful support'' in the Persian Gulf.   At the economic summit of industrial nations in Houston lastJuly, the administration balked at providing the Soviet Union withcash grants or loans but agreed to provide the technical assistance.   About 80 other nations receive American technical assistance,which can range from developing a fly-resistant wheat in Morocco tobringing down Bangladesh's fertility rate.   The Soviets need help with improving their transportationsystems and housing, said business leaders who will make the trip.Several officers of U.S. oil companies are also accompanyingMosbacher.   ``Big chunks of money are not what they want. They want to havethe exposure to the management techniques and constructiontechniques and operating techniques that we take for granted,''Hungerford said.   Hungerford's company, for example, is engaged in a joint venturewith the Soviets to help them with a heating system for tank railcars that performs well in cold climates. His firm also is helpingthe Soviets improve their transportation of petrochemical products.   Another transportation company, Sea-Land Service Inc., ofEdison, N.J. _ will be represented by its chief executive, Alex J.Mandl. Sea-Land specializes in ``global distribution networks.''   Mandl said the trip gives him a chance to help both Bush and hiscompany.   ``That part of the world is opening up. As long as the IronCurtain was up, our distribution network did not participate inthat part of the world. As that wall comes down, we have a chanceto be in there,'' Mandl said.   Leonard Sylk, chairman and chief executive officer of ShelterSystems Group of Hainesport, N.J., said the Soviets have beeninterested in his firm's expertise because it makes manufacturedhousing components. They are the roofs, floors and walls thatlarge-scale builders use in putting up houses.   The Soviets have voiced interest in using wood for housing, asin the United States, rather than the concrete and cinder blocksnow used, Sylk said.   U.S. businesses stand to gain if the Soviet economy improves,the executives said.   ``It's in our interest as a nation to help them at least getinto the last part of the 20th century. They say to make peace isto make prosperity, and vice versa,'' Hungerford said.   Other companies to be represented on the trip are, according togovernment sources, are:   Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. of Decatur, Ill.; Atlantic RichfieldCo. of Los Angeles; Chevron Corp., of San Francisco; DresserIndustries of Dallas; Fortune Magazine of New York; GlenairInternational of Del Mar, Calif.   Also, the Louisiana Land and Exploration Co. of New Orleans;PaineWebber of New York; Pepsico Inc. of Purchase, N.Y.; Pruet OilCo., of El Dorado, Ark.; Texaco Inc., of White Plains N.Y.; andUnited Telecommunications of Westwood, Kan.</TEXT></DOC>
