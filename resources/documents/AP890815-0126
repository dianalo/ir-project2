If the astronomer is successful, tiny particles of light willjump back across the vast distance and be captured by telescopes atthe McDonald Observatory near Fort Davis, Texas.   If he's not successful, Whipple says he'll still enjoy the lunareclipse _ a rare opportunity to watch the full moon change from abright silver to a polished copper or faint orange, or, perhaps,even vanish from view.   People on the continents bordering the Atlantic Ocean will have achance to see some phase of the lunar eclipse. It will start at 8:23p.m. EDT and end about 5{ hours later.   It will be the first full lunar eclipse since December 1982, andthe next one will not occur until December 1992.   In the United States, the East Coast will have the best viewing,if skies are clear, while Alaska will miss it altogether. In thecentral, mountain and western time zones, the eclipse will be underway already by the time the moon becomes visible. Moonrise inChicago, for instance, is at 7:43 p.m. CDT, twenty minutes after theeclipse begins. And in Los Angeles, the moon rises at 7:35 p.m. PDT,when the eclipse is already in totality.   Cloudy skies could spoil the celestial show for much of the East.Wednesday forecasts call for thundershowers. Observers may havebetter luck in the central and western areas of the country whereclear to partly cloudy skies are predicted for most areas.   With good local weather, some phase of the spectacle should bevisible to observers in North and South America, western Europe andAfrica, and the Antarctic. Sailors at sea in the Atlantic and in theeastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to see part of the eclipse.   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadowcreated by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in itsorbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline.   For Whipple, the total eclipse is precious opportunity to firelaser beams at a darkened full moon.   The University of Texas and McDonald Observatory astronomer willbe firing the laser at a reflector placed near a lunar featurecalled Hadley Rille in 1971 by the Apollo 15 astronauts.   ``Anytime the moon sites are available, we fire the laser,'' hesaid in a telephone interview. But Whipple said it is impossible tosee the laser reflection from a full moon because the naturalsurface reflects sunlight so powerfully. Only during an eclipse, hesaid, can McDonald scientists detect light reflecting from theApollo instruments.   By clocking the time it takes for light to travel from the laserto the moon and then back to the McDonald telescopes, scientists areable to precisely measure the distance between the Earth and itsmoon.   Whipple said in the years since astronomers have been laserranging to the Apollo reflectors, they have discovered that the moonis moving away from the Earth at the rate of about two inches ayear. The mean distance between the Earth and moon is about 230,000miles.   But even without the laser experiment, Whipple said theastronomers are eagerly awaiting the eclipse.   ``We're looking forward to the show,'' he said.   During an eclipse, the moon can appear to be a bright coppery redif there is clean air between the lunar surface and the observer onEarth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon can dim to anfaint orange color or even fade from view altogether.   Dust from volcanic eruptions can contribute to the color, butastronomers say that enough time has passed since the last majorvolcanic eruption that most dust has settled.   The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called thepenumbra, the outer fringe of the Earth's shadow. This phase showsas a grayish shading of the moon. Half an hour later, the moon edgesinto the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow. Total eclipse,when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, will begin at about10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes.   When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverseorder. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges outof the shadow altogether and regains its customary bright silvercolor.</TEXT></DOC>
