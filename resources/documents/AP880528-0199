Gorbachev may be general secretaryof the avowedly atheistic Soviet Communist Party, but that hasn'tstopped him from referring several times in recent months to Godand Jesus Christ.   Gorbachev, whose mother is a regular churchgoer, used a biblicalallusion during a May 18 interview with The Washington Post andNewsweek when seeking to explain the limits on his current drive torestructure Soviet society.   ``Jesus Christ alone knew answers to all questions and knew howto feed 20,000 Jews with five loaves of bread,'' he said. ``Wedon't possess that skill, we have no ready prescription to solveall our problems quickly.''   Last December, Gorbachev invoked God's name during summit talkswith President Reagan in Washington.   The Soviet leader said his visit had augmented his knowledgeabout the United States.   ``We discussed with the president that it would be a good thingto have more of an informal visit, to travel around the country ...and I believe that if the Politburo and God are well disposedtoward me then I might do this without putting it off for toolong,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, May 30</NOTE></DOC>
