Nearly all the stores on the main street are burned out or boarded shut. The flower boxes along the railroad tracks are empty and rotting. The tiny Tug River is clogged with trash and sewage. All signs of economic life have fled.    Only the people remain.    &quot;I haven't worked in 3 1/2 years,&quot; says Troy Roberts, who sits at a street corner with four other men and shares a bottle in a brown paper bag. &quot;I started working in the mines when I was 15. My dad worked 32 years. If there was jobs, I'd still be working. But there ain't jobs.&quot;    Mr. Roberts's lament is heard all over McDowell County, where the official unemployment rate runs an astronomical 32%, and local authorities say the true rate is higher. Similar problems afflict other isolated corners of the nation as well, places like Starr County, Texas, Sharkey County, Miss., and Mora County, N.M. After 5 1/2 years of a rising economic tide, these areas are still stuck on rock bottom, with no hope in sight.    Nationwide, the civilian jobless rate has dropped to 5.6% of the work force, the lowest in nearly a decade. The fall has led economists and policy makers to speculate about whether unemployment has reached its &quot;natural&quot; rate -- the lowest it can go without generating labor shortages and inflation.    But there is nothing natural about the idleness in these disparate pockets of poverty. According to government statistics for January, the latest available, 30 U.S. counties still have jobless rates of 25% or higher. More than 100 others are over 15%.    In some cases, these counties' difficulties are deeply rooted in history. The rural areas of the Rio Grande valley and the Mississippi delta, for instance, have long faced intractable problems of poverty.    In other cases, high jobless rates reflect the wrenching effects of world trade. A soaring dollar in the early 1980s caused many industrial, agricultural and mining products to lose out to foreign competition. &quot;We've always had pockets of unemployment,&quot; says Janet Norwood, the commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. &quot;That's not unusual. But the restructuring of industry over the last couple of years has moved at a faster pace than in the past, and that's had an impact.&quot;    In most of these areas, high unemployment has created a vicious cycle of impoverishment. The lack of jobs reduces the tax base; a shrinking tax base starves schools and other community services; and the low level of education and services diminishes the chance of attracting new industry and jobs -- while also making it harder for people to leave and find work elsewhere. If it weren't for government welfare payments, many such counties would differ little from destitute Third World nations.    Some experts fear that the problems will grow even worse in the years ahead, as a more and more technological economy increases the need for an educated, skilled labor force. &quot;It used to be that an illiterate adult with a strong back could always find a job,&quot; says Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, which has several counties mired in jobless rates exceeding 20%. &quot;But that's just not true anymore.&quot;    Here in McDowell County, unemployment is inextricably tied to the decline of one industry: coal. For years, the county prospered by supplying the metallurgical coal that fired the nation's steel mills. Work was plentiful, and the pay high. At the beginning of this decade, many miners were earning more than $40,000 a year.    &quot;When I was growing up, this area was booming,&quot; says David Goad, a 15-year veteran of the mines who was laid off two years ago. &quot;I came out of the Navy, and there was no incentive to go back to school. If your dad worked in the mines, you could, too.&quot;    The mining companies dominated the county. They owned most of the land, discouraged the development of other industries, even ran many utilities and commercial businesses.    &quot;Since the late 1800s, we've been a single-industry-based economy,&quot; says Earl Whiteley, administrator of the local hospital and head of the county Economic Development Authority. &quot;People never thought there needed to be an alternative. It was pretty much King Coal.&quot;    But the king was dethroned by the steel industry's long decline, and most of the county's mines shut down. The worst blow came on Nov. 7, 1986, when U.S. Steel Mining Co. closed its last mine in the county and laid off more than 1,000 employees. Today, only the industry's remnants survive: giant slag piles and corrugated metal buildings, rusted and pocked with holes.    In the past two years, the county has struggled to bring in new industry. But it faces huge obstacles: Practically no level land (the one site being promoted is a flattened-out mountaintop); no sewers (instead, streams carry all kinds of refuse); narrow roads with potholes and weak bridges (at one old span on the main road to Davy, buses sometimes unload their passengers before crossing).    &quot;I was surprised when I heard the National Guard of West Virginia had gone to Honduras to build a road,&quot; Mr. Whiteley says. &quot;Hell, we can't get a road built here.&quot;    Also causing companies to shy away is the county's history of union violence. Southern West Virginia is where the United Mine Workers was born and where the coal wars were fought years ago.    Now, with the coal industry in a hole, the county's major employers are the school board and the government-funded hospital. Most of the other residents live off savings, unemployment insurance, welfare and food stamps.    Desperate for anything that will create jobs, local leaders recently made a bid to locate a controversial federal nuclear-waste dump in the county. &quot;The area's survival is at stake,&quot; writes the Welch Daily News publisher, David Corcoran. &quot;The project promises to bring improved roads and a higher standard of living.&quot;    A far cry from McDowell County, W.Va., is Mora County, N.M. It is a region of haunting beauty, with flat grasslands adorned, here and there, with mesas and pine trees. To the west, the snow-capped Sangre de Cristo Mountains majestically mark the horizon. The people are mostly Hispanic, some with family roots in the region going back centuries.    &quot;Don't think of Mora as a place where people are destitute,&quot; says Sam Adelo, who headed a task force that recently looked into the county's problems. &quot;There is a genteel way of life. People will sell a little hay, sell a cow or two, do services for each other. They love their way of life.&quot;    But they don't have jobs. The Labor Department put the unemployment rate at 34% in January.    Like McDowell County, Mora suffers partly from isolation; it is far from Albuquerque and Santa Fe, the centers of commerce and government. And unlike neighboring Taos County, it hasn't attracted tourists. (Even with its tourists, Taos suffers from a 23% jobless rate.)    One of Mora County's affluent few, David Salman, lives a short way outside the town of Mora. Seated at a desk in his home, he discusses the county's woes.    &quot;The main thing is that there's nothing here,&quot; he says. &quot;There's no agriculture, and there's no industry. There are no resources, no oil, no minerals. There's nothing a family can get by on.&quot; He himself raises cattle, but a single yearling needs 10 to 15 acres of grassland. Only a few local people have enough land to feed a herd.    Mr. Salman also has a small but thriving business in raspberries. But such efforts, he says, &quot;are capital-intensive, management-intensive and marketing-intensive.&quot; He says he had to buy his own truck to get his fruit to market.    Mora's people are willing to work, Mr. Salman says, noting that hundreds appear whenever he hires raspberry pickers. Usually, they haven't anything to do -- yet many refuse to leave. &quot;There is a tie to the Hispanic culture here,&quot; he says. &quot;The whole life style keeps people here, and even brings people back.&quot;    The town of Mora, like Davy, is a place of vacant storefronts. To shop, people drive 32 miles to Las Vegas, N.M. Mora's only surviving businesses are Teresa Maria's cafe, an auto-parts store, a liquor store and several bars. As in McDowell County, drinking is a favorite pastime.    &quot;Alcoholism is very high,&quot; says Virginia Alaniz, who directs an alcoholic-treatment center just outside of town. &quot;This is a rural area, and there aren't many things to do here. There is a lot of cruising&quot; -- and a lot of alcohol-related auto accidents.    In both Mora and McDowell counties, the people often complain bitterly of &quot;politics.&quot; In both, government agencies are the main employers, and elected officials become powerful dispensers of patronage. In both, many people feel that public services are neglected. In McDowell County, officials express regret that sewers weren't built back when the county was thriving. And in Mora, charges of misused funds were one reason Gov. Garrey Carruthers set up the task force to study the county's problems. &quot;Politics has hindered Mora for a long time,&quot; Ms. Alaniz says.    Like McDowell, Mora County recently tried to develop new industries, with little success. &quot;Everybody always has big ideas about bringing industry in,&quot; Mr. Salman says. &quot;But it's very difficult to generate economic activity of any permanence in an area like this.&quot;    The best solution, he contends, &quot;is to educate our young people so they can leave.&quot; And many do leave. But as Mora County Commissioner Matias Maestas notes, &quot;It's very difficult for people to leave the area to seek employment because they aren't skilled.&quot;    And in such places, some just don't want to go. The little town of War, W.Va., has only $6,000 in its treasury, and Jeannie Snodgrass, its mayor, faces a showdown with the Environmental Protection Agency this summer over its failure to install sewers. Nevertheless, she is proud of her home and wears a large, bright button that reads: &quot;We Love War.&quot;    &quot;This is home to a lot of us,&quot; she says. &quot;I was raised here, went to school here. We have garbage, I have to admit, but there's a closeness. Nobody can take that away.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
