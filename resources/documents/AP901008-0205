Since the Iraqi invasion of oil-rich Kuwait in early August, theaverage price of gasoline nationwide has jumped 26{ cents a gallonat the pump. Since the crisis began, an international embargo hasblocked all Iraqi oil exports.   The sale of Kuwaiti oil also was banned to prevent Iraqi leaderSaddam Hussein from making money on appropriated crude oilreserves. Increases in oil market prices were passed on toconsumers quickly.   ``The cause, of course, is the continued pass-through of highercrude oil prices, which is driven by fears of shortages due toconfrontation in the Middle East,'' analyst Trilby Lundberg saidSunday in a telephone interview.   The latest biweekly Lundberg Survey of 13,500 gasoline stationsnationwide showed the overall price of gas for all grades,including taxes, was 144.20 cents per gallon. The survey was takenFriday.   The average price was 5.84 cents higher than the average derivedfrom a Sept. 21 Lundberg sampling, she said.   The Lundberg Survey's overall average price on July 20 - thelatest pre-invasion sample - was nearly $1.18 a gallon.   ``The price increases have really put on speed,'' said Lundberg,adding that she was unable to predict whether prices would continuetheir upward spiral.   ``It's entirely dependent on what the crude oil market does,''Lundberg said. ``It's insecurity, but not a world shortage. Thesensitivity of the market is tremendous.''   The survey taken Friday showed the average price of regularleaded gasoline, including taxes, at self-serve pumps was 130.59cents per gallon. At full service stations, regular leaded averaged152.21 cents.   Self-serve unleaded was 133.56 cents per gallon, andfull-service unleaded was 155.11. Premium unleaded was 149.95 centsper gallon at self-serve and 168.79 at full service.   Lundberg notes self-service customers represent more than 80percent of gasoline sales. ``The full service prices reallyrepresent a specialty service that not too many use,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
