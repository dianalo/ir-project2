<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0277 </DOCNO><TEXT>This bibliography contains citations concerning computational fluid dynamics(CFD), a new method in computational science to perform complex flowsimulations in three dimensions. Applications include aerodynamic designand analysis for aircraft, rockets, and missiles, and automobiles; heat-transferstudies; and combustion processes. Included are references to supercomputers,array processors, and parallel processors where needed for complete,integrated design. Also included are software packages and grid-generationtechniques required to apply CFD numerical solutions. Numerical methodsfor fluid dynamics, not requiring supercomputers, are found in a separatepublished search. (Contains 83 citations fully indexed and includinga title list.)</TEXT></DOC>
