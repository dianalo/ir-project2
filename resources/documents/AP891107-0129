Even President Mikhail S. Gorbachev tempered the Revolution Dayfestivities by saying the nation's economic problems hang like a``sword of Damocles over us.''   A column of about 5,000 marchers paraded peacefully throughMoscow to challenge Communist Party authority, while a few milesaway, Gorbachev and other leaders celebrated the 72nd anniversaryof the revolution reviewing the traditional show of military force.   Activists in the southwest republic of Moldavia said policebroke up a crowd of thousands of would-be protesters and beat someof them. The military part of the parade in its capital, Kishinev,was canceled.   In the Arctic city of Vorkuta, striking coal miners joined theofficial celebration, but carried slogans demanding moreindependence and that the government fulfill promises of betterliving and working conditions.   In some trouble spots, such as the Caucasus republics of Armeniaand Georgia, state-run media said traditional parades werecanceled. Boris Sokolov, an activist from the Baltic republic ofLatvia, said a small group of people burned a red Soviet flag inthe center of Riga, the capital.   Gorbachev, interviewed by Soviet TV atop Lenin's Mausoleum inRed Square, acknowledged that many Soviets feel threatened by foodshortages and the disorganization of the consumer market.   ``When all this is hanging like a sword of Damocles over us, itis very important we do not forget the main thing, that this is theway we have chosen to follow,'' he said, referring to the Greeklegend in which a sword was strung by a single hair over the headof Damocles, a royal attendant, to show the precariousness of power.   Gorbachev said the Soviet leadership has not yet been able toreplace fully the administrative system of the past, and ``thusthere exists a loss, or a weakening of control. Shall we go back?That would be a mistake, the greatest mistake.''   The anniversary marks the day in 1917 when the Bolsheviks underLenin seized power from a provisional government that had ruled forabout eight months after Czar Nicholas II abdicated.   Those who marched more than four hours in the unofficial columnmade clear they believed the revolution had gotten them little butfood shortages, pollution, and the KGB secret police.   ``We're tired of 70 years of Communist power with nothing havingchanged for the better, and this is our protest,'' said TaisyaShlyonova, a retiree. One placard characterized communist rule as``72 years on the road to nowhere.''   Police supervised their route from northwest Moscow to thecity's Olympic stadium less than two miles from Red Square, wherethey held a rally. Organizers had reached an agreement with cityofficials not to head for Red Square, and roads to the center wereblocked by double lines of police in case they changed their mind.   Grassroots groups marched in official parades in several Sovietcities last year, but this apparently was the firstcounterdemonstration of any size permitted on Revolution Day.   Yuri Rozhgo, a spokesman for the Moldavian People's Frontorganization, said by telephone from Kishinev, the republic'scapital, that police beat people in a crowd of thousands whogathered near a monument to national hero King Stephen the Greatnear the parade route before dawn.   He said more were beaten by police who dispersed a crowd of acouple of about 100 People's Front supporters on Lenin Prospekt.   Officials canceled the military part of the parade, but ademonstration of workers went off as scheduled. Following that,Rozhgo said, thousands of People's Front supporters marched theparade route with slogans condemning the police and the republic'sleadership.   He did not know how many people were injured or detained bypolice, but said that most of those detained were released withinhours.   In Vorkuta in the Soviet Arctic, coal miners who have been onstrike for two weeks joined the official celebration, but withtheir own banners, said city strike committee spokesman PavelBelyaev.   The slogans called on the government to fulfill the promises itmade in July to end a walkout, criticized bureaucracy, and demandedmore independence.   Strikers met on the eve of the holiday with Coal MinistryMikhail Shchadov, but did not agree to return to work. Belyaev saidonly regular maintenance was done at the striking mines Tuesday,and it was unclear when the strike would end.   In Latvia, where local People's Front organizations declared theBolshevik Revolution was a coup that curtailed the country'sdevelopment of democracy, the official Latinform news agencyreported no disturbances. Activists reported Lvov, a hotbed ofUkrainian activists, was quiet as well.   The parade on Red Square, held under a leaden sky withtemperatures just above freezing, was more low-key than in previousyears.   No strategic missiles were in evidence. The military part of theparade, including more than 8,000 soldiers, sailors, airmen andparatroopers, a speech by Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov, arumble of distant cannon fire and a show of military hardware, tookslightly more than 30 minutes.   The military hardware took only five minutes to rumble throughthe medieval square, leaving behind clouds of smoke and the smellof diesel fuel.   A 90-minute march of thousands of people carrying officiallyapproved banners, paper flowers and balloons followed.   Several slogans demanded an end to extremism in the tenserelations between Soviet ethnic groups. One poster, protestingincreasing prices, showed a vacuum cleaner, labeled ``prices,''sucking rubles away from a working man.</TEXT></DOC>
