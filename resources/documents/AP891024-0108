A policy requiring approval by senior Justice Departmentofficials of efforts to seize a defendant's assets was imposed inresponse to criticism of the tactic in several highly publicizedcases, according to one of the memos, which were sent to federalprosecutors.   The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act allowsprosecutors to obtain temporary restraining orders to seize assetsof defendants to ensure the funds are available if a jury ordersthem forfeited as part of a verdict.   But Assistant Attorney General Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. saidprosecutors should make clear in court that ``the government willnot seek to disrupt the normal, legitimate business activities ofthe defendant.''   ``Some highly publicized cases ... have been the subject ofconsiderable criticism in the press, because of a perception thatpre-trial freezing of assets is tantamount to a seizure of propertywithout due process,'' Dennis wrote in the June 30 memorandum.   Another memo, by Assistant Attorney General Shirley D. Peterson,head of the tax division, sharply limits the use of the RICO law intax-fraud cases.   Mail-fraud charges may be sustituted for tax-fraud charges toform the basis of RICO prosecutions ``only in exceptionalcircumstances'' when a tax return is mailed to promote a``tax-fraud scheme,'' she wrote in a separate memorandum.   ``Charging a tax offense as a mail-fraud charge could be viewedas circumventing congressional intent unless unique circumtancesjustifying the use of a mail-fraud charge are present,'' Petersonwrote.   Dennis, who heads the department's criminal division, did notmention any specific pre-trial asset seizures that promptedcriticism.   But defense attorneys roundly criticized former Manhattan U.S.Attorney Rudolph Giuliani for obtaining a court order seizing theassets of a securities firm whose officers were charged withracketeering.   Defense lawyers contend that the government's forfeiture demandsdrove the firm, Princeton-Newport Partners LP, out of business lastDecember.   Jurors who convicted five Princeton-Newport partners and a sixthdefendant of racketeering charges in August awarded only $3.8million of the $21 million prosecutors sought in forfeitures, with$3 million coming from one defendant.   Originally targeted at organized crime and drug traffickers, theRICO law was used for the first time in the Princeton-Newport caseto prosecute securities dealers.   It has since been used as a basis to indict 46 commoditiestraders in Chicago. Michael R. Millken, the former head of DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc.'s ``junk bond'' department, is awaiting trialnext March on racketeering charges.   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said both memosunderscored existing department policy.   But Dennis wrote that his memo ``implements new policy''requiring approval by the Justice Department's Organized Crime andRacketeering Section before prosecutors seek temporary restrainingorders to seize a defendant's assets.   To get such approval, ``the prosecutor must show thatless-intrusive remedies (such as bonds) are not likely to preservethe assets for forfeiture in the event of a conviction,'' Denniswrote in the memo, first disclosed over the weekend in Newsday, theLong Island, N.Y., newspaper.   He noted that ``the government's policy is not to seek thefullest forfeiture permissable under the law where that forfeiturewould be disproportionate to the defendant's crime.''   Forfeiture orders, Dennis noted, ``can have a wide-rangingimpact on third parties who do business with the defendants,including clients, vendors, banks, investors, creditors, dependentsand others.''   The new requirements were instituted ``to ensure that the rightsof all interested parties are protected,'' Dennis said.   Runkel dimissed suggestions that Dennis' memo was issued inresponse to tactics employed by Giuliani, who is now theRepublican-Liberal candidate for mayor in New York City. ``To thebest of my knowledge, the answer to that is no,'' Runkel said.   Runkel noted that the government's asset-forfeiture actions inthe Princeton-Newport case were upheld in the courts.</TEXT></DOC>
