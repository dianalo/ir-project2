Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT F </CO><IN> TNM BNK FIN </IN><TEXT>   The insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. has devised a new gimmick to persuade acquirers of failed thrifts to accept FSLIC notes as a form of financial assistance.    The gimmick, known as a &quot;pocket charter,&quot; was designed to allay fears by thrift acquirers that the FSLIC or a successor agency might default on its notes. The maneuver essentially would allow an acquirer of a failed thrift to avoid financial damage in case of a FSLIC default.    Concerns about such defaults have helped derail major acquisitions of failed thrifts, including a bid by Ford Motor Co. to acquire American Savings andamp; Loan Association, Stockton, Calif., the nation's largest insolvent thrift.    Under the new maneuver, the acquirer of a failed thrift also receives a charter for a new, separate thrift that it holds &quot;in its pocket,&quot; as one official explained, for use only if the FSLIC defaults on a note it issued.    If the FSLIC defaults on its interest-bearing note, the acquirer of the failed thrift then can put the FSLIC note into the new, pocket-chartered thrift as the thrift's sole asset. The acquirer also puts into the new thrift an amount of FSLIC-insured deposits equal to the amount of the FSLIC note and stops making interest payments on the deposits, which become liabilities of the new thrift.    The new, pocket-chartered thrift would be a mutual institution owned by its depositors, and the acquirer of the old failed thrift wouldn't have an ownership interest in it or any obligations to its depositors.    The FSLIC, as a deposit insurance agency, would have to guarantee the deposits in the new thrift. A failure by the FSLIC to make interest payments on its note would then only reduce the funds available to make interest payments to depositors. However, any failure by the FSLIC to make good on its obligations to depositors is viewed as so politically damaging that Congress would never let it happen.    Officials of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which controls the FSLIC, have said frequently that any default by the FSLIC is unthinkable. But because the FSLIC is currently insolvent by at least $13.6 billion and is expected to require a taxpayer-funded bailout, thrift executives and accountants have expressed concern about whether the FSLIC will meet all its future obligations to companies that acquire failed thrifts.    The pocket-charter device was used in the acquisition last week of Bell Savings andamp; Loan Association, San Mateo, Calif., by an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon. The Bell transaction is believed to be the first in which the Bank Board issued a pocket charter.    Neither FSLIC nor the Simon group mentioned the pocket charter in their public statements about the transaction. The use of the charter was disclosed in a private-placement memorandum circulated by the Simon group in connection with the sale of $220 million in securities to finance the acquisition of Bell andamp; Western Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Los Angeles, a healthy thrift. A copy of the memo was obtained by this newspaper.    Officials of the Simon group, known as WestFed Holding Inc., and the Bank Board didn't return telephone calls yesterday seeking comment.    In describing how the pocket-charter maneuver would work if the FSLIC defaults, the private-placement memo said, &quot;There is no precedent for this procedure, and therefore the ability of the company (WestFed) to successfully avail itself of this remedy in the event of a default by the FSLIC, particularly if the FSLIC were insolvent, is uncertain.&quot;    In some respects, the pocket-charter device is similar to other methods that acquirers of failed thrifts have used recently to set up units that will hold FSLIC notes.    The Bank Board balked, however, at a method suggested by Ford in its bid for American Savings. According to officials familiar with the talks, Ford suggested immediately setting up a separate thrift that would hold certain FSLIC obligations and an approximately equal amount of deposits gathered by Wall Street firms. The unit, known as the &quot;air bank,&quot; would have been clearly separate from Ford's big thrift unit, First Nationwide Bank.    Ford officials couldn't be reached, but have consistently declined to comment on any acquisition talks.    Ford has also suggested an &quot;air bank&quot; structure in its bid for Lincoln Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a troubled thift based in Westfield, N.J., officials familiar with the talks said. However they said that Ford may accept the pocket-charter device in that transaction because the amount of FSLIC aid required for Lincoln Federal is much smaller than what would have been required for American Savings.    The Bank Board has agreed to provide an estimated $2 billion of assistance for Robert M. Bass Group Inc., Fort Worth, Texas, to acquire American Savings. American Savings and Lincoln Federal aren't related to similarly named thrifts outside their home states. </TEXT></DOC>
