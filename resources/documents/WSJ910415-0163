John Kerry asked Federal ReserveChairman Alan Greenspan for &quot;a comprehensive report&quot; on BCCIHoldings (Luxembourg) S.A. and its related U.S. entities, andurged the Fed to take a tough stance in its investigation ofthe growing international banking scandal.   &quot;Confidence in First American, the largest financialinstitution headquartered in the Washington, D.C., area,&quot; theMassachusetts Democrat said in an April 12 letter to the Fedchairman, &quot;can't be restored unless a comprehensive and fullyindependent review of all the relevant facts concerning BCCIand CCAH is undertaken.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   CCAH, or Credit andamp; Commerce American Holdings, is theparent company of First American Bank. Investigations byManhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau recentlyrevealed that it is substantially owned by BCCI, aLuxembourg-based and Arab-owned bank that pleaded guilty lastyear to money-laundering in Federal court in Tampa, Fla.   The Fed, which is investigating BCCI and its links withFirst American Bank and Independence Bank, Encino, Calif.,recently issued orders requiring BCCI to sell its stake inthe parent company of Washington's First American Bank and toend operations in the U.S. In addition, it has toldWashington's First American and BCCI to keep their businessesseparate. A Fed spokesman confirmed receiving Sen. Kerry'sletter but declined to comment on it.   Sen. Kerry, a member of the Senate Banking Committee,chairs the subcommittee that began looking into BCCI and itsmoney-laundering activities in 1988, sparking Mr.Morgenthau's investigation.   In his letter to Mr. Greenspan, Sen. Kerry criticized thecurrent restructuring of BCCI, which is being organized inLondon and Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The senator saidhe had been advised by BCCI attorneys that senior staff fromthe bank's former management during the time ofmoney-laundering -- including former chief executive officer,Swaleh Naqvi and Senior Officer Zafar Iqbal -- were playing akey role in the restructuring process.   The involvement of Mr. Naqvi, who was fired from the bank,&quot;raises the question of whether the institution now intendsto provide a full public accounting of its improprieties, oris in fact engaging in damage control, or worse,&quot; Sen. Kerrysaid. Mr. Iqbal also &quot;was part of BCCI's management duringthe period of widespread abuses,&quot; Sen. Kerry said.</TEXT></DOC>
