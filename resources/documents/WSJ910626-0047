The company, a direct-mail marketer of sports equipment toschools, expects to report net income of $760,000, or 16cents a share, for the second quarter, compared with anestimated $450,000 for the same period a year ago, before thecompany was public, said Chairman Michael Blumenfeld.PaineWebber previously had projected second-quarter net of 21cents a share.   The company said its second-quarter results, to bereleased in about a month, will reflect later-than-usualrequests for bids by school districts and municipalities,some of which are experiencing local budget problems. Thecompany said it expects to make up at least some of theshortfall in the third quarter.   PaineWebber analyst Walter Kirchberger said in a reportthat the expected second-quarter results &quot;are more indicativeof a timing problem than a change in the long-termfundamentals.&quot;   &quot;As the economy emerges from a recession and a war, someunexpected hesitation in the rate of recovery is reasonableand makes precise quarterly estimates difficult,&quot; Mr.Kirchberger wrote.   PaineWebber managed Sport Supply's initial offering of 3.5million common shares at $9.50 a share in April. The companyis 26% owned by BSN Corp., a sporting goods concern thatowned all of Sport Supply's stock before the offering.</TEXT></DOC>
