Mr. Bush won a nasty fight with Mr. Buchanan in Georgia,but once again the conservative commentator made seriousinroads. Mr. Bush prevailed, but with Mr. Buchanan winning36% of the vote with almost all of the ballots counted. Mr.Buchanan won 37% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary twoweeks ago, and Bush strategists at the time contended thatwas the best he would do.</LP><TEXT>   And in Maryland, where the Republican Party istraditionally moderate in outlook, Mr. Buchanan won 30% ofthe vote. He visited the state once, a month ago, holding asmall rally in a Washington suburb. Mr. Buchanan was winningabout the same percentage of the GOP votes in Colorado.   By continuing to embarrass a discombobulated Mr. Bush, Mr.Buchanan ensures that his challenge will go on, and on,probably all the way to the big California primary on June 2.   The leading Democrats, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas andformer Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, got what theywanted most. But Mr. Clinton showed surprising strength, andmay have gone some distance in putting his campaign backtogether. He won a decisive victory in Georgia and was closeelsewhere, proving he remains a formidable contender,especially on his home turf, and giving him momentum as heheads into the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday next week.With most of the votes counted, he was piling up 58% of thevote on the way to his first primary victory. Mr. Tsongas wasa distant second at 23%.   And Mr. Tsongas won in Maryland, with 41% of the vote,proving he can do well outside his native New England. Mr.Clinton was second with an impressive 33%. Mr. Tsongas alsowas leading in the Utah primary, with more than half thevotes counted, by seven points over former California Gov.Jerry Brown.   Colorado, the third big primary for the Democrats in whatwas the biggest day yet on the 1992 election calendar, was aclassic muddle. With about half the votes counted, Mr.Clinton was barely ahead of Mr. Brown. Mr. Tsongas was third.By winning more than 20% of the vote -- and he was pulling28% -- Mr. Brown will requalify for federal matching funds tokeep his barebones campaign moving.   Speaking in Miami last night, Mr. Clinton hailed hisGeorgia victory as &quot;an unprecedented boost.&quot; He said the win,along with his performances elsewhere, had changed thecampaign. &quot;It's better than it was yesterday,&quot; he said.Speaking in South Carolina, the pro-business Mr. Tsongashailed his Maryland victory, saying &quot;the American people aredeciding tonight. They want a president, not a Santa Claus.&quot;   The big losers in yesterday's contests were Sens. TomHarkin of Iowa and Bob Kerrey of Nebraska. Strategists forboth men will need to ponder whether their campaigns havemuch potential.   Voters went to the polls in seven states, with 383Democratic and 198 Republican delegates to this summer'snational conventions at stake. Republicans and Democrats heldcaucuses in Minnesota and Washington, and Democrats had theirown caucus in Idaho. (There were also three delegate votes atstake in Democratic caucuses in American Samoa.) Thosetallies were still being counted early today.   For Republicans, the major contest was Georgia, scene ofthe political equivalent of the siege of Atlanta. That Mr.Bush encountered so much fierce opposition in Georgia was, onthe face of it, shocking. Four years ago, he easily turnedaside three serious opponents in the GOP primary -- Sen.Robert Dole of Kansas, evangelist Pat Robertson andconservative Jack Kemp -- and won 54% of the vote. In thefall, he defeated Democrat Michael Dukakis by 20 points.   Yesterday, however, running as the incumbent president, hewas embattled. Mr. Buchanan slammed Mr. Bush in toughtelevision ads for countenancing pornography in federal artsgrants and for signing what Mr. Buchanan calls a racial-quotabill. Voters in Georgia, as elsewhere, fumed at Mr. Bush forbreaking his no-new-taxes pledge. In telephone interviews onelection day with Georgia reporters, Mr. Bush conceded he hadmade &quot;a mistake&quot; by agreeing to a tax increase that wasincluded in the 1990 budget agreement.   Appealing to self-styled Democrats and independents (thereis no party registration in Georgia), Mr. Buchanan hoped fromthe start to do as well here as the 37% of the vote he won inNew Hampshire. Exit polls indicated thousands of angryDemocrats, many of them the &quot;Bubba&quot; vote (working-class whitevoters, typically from rural parts of the state), chose toparticipate in the GOP contest.   &quot;Buchanan appealed to a lot of Democrats and independentsand got them into the Republican primary,&quot; said Bush campaignchairman Robert Teeter. But that vote reflects &quot;a frustrationwith government, a feeling that government is too big anddoesn't work very well.&quot; Mr. Teeter said President Bushshares that view.   Mr. Bush last night went out of his way to emphasize he isgetting the message. &quot;To those who have been with me in thepast but did not vote for me today, I hear your concerns andunderstand your frustration with Washington,&quot; he said. &quot;I amcommitted to regaining your support.&quot;   Speaking in Georgia, Mr. Buchanan once again claimedvictory, even in defeat. &quot;We're going to go all the way,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The battle of Georgia is now over, and it's won, andthe battle of the South begins tomorrow.&quot;   Surprising, too, was Mr. Buchanan's performance inMaryland, supposedly a citadel of moderate Republicanism.Exit polls indicated, just as they did in New Hampshire, thatMr. Buchanan does much better with men than with women. Abouttwo out of three of his voters in Maryland were male.   Mr. Bush now faces the grisly prospect of moredebilitating warfare with the pugnacious Mr. Buchanan nextweek, Super Tuesday, in such states as Florida, Texas andMassachusetts.   Democrats, meanwhile, trying desperately to pick afront-runner who might be able to take advantage this fall ofMr. Bush's plummeting popularity and the splintering in theGOP ranks, looked to the primaries in Maryland and Georgia,and, to a lesser degree, Colorado. But no clear favoriteemerged.   Mr. Clinton pinned his hopes on Georgia, where hesuccessfully combined the votes of blacks and working-classwhite Democrats. Exit polls indicated he won 74% of theblacks who took part in what appeared to be a low turnout.His only serious challenger was Mr. Tsongas, who made a morecerebral appeal to middle-class Democrats, mostly collegegraduates, the same kind of vote he won in New Hampshire lastmonth.   Former Gov. Brown generally seems to do well in stateswhere radio stations regularly report on ski conditions. Healmost won the Maine caucuses, and he performed handsomelyyesterday in Colorado. He will slog on, appealing toenvironmentalists and voters opposed to nuclear power. He hasfound a niche, and will continue to exploit it.   The Democratic battleground shifts now to Super Tuesdaynext week, with contests in 11 states. But the results thenmight not be decisive either. Many observers look furtherdown the road to big primaries in Illinois and Michigan onMarch 17 to establish a front-runner.</TEXT></DOC>
