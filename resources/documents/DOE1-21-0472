This progress has led to structural changes in thefield of information transmission. New fast-growing areas of research,development, and production have resulted. After an introduction intofibre optics technology, the most important types of fibres, i.e. silicafibres, non-oxide fibres, and polymer fibres, are reviewed. Their varioususes, production, and development trends are discussed in relation tothe properties of these materials.</TEXT></DOC>
