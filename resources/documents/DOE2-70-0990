The secondary standard consists of /sup 60/Co treatment unit Chisobalt,a Baldwin-Farmer dosemeter and a Baldwin ionization chamber. The exposureand kerma rates of the primary dosimetry standard which is regularlychecked are used. The parameters, uncertainties and stability of thesecondary standard are discussed. A comparison of absorbed doses from/sup 60/Co gamma rays of therapy units in water phantom was performedfor all radiotherapy centers in Czechoslovakia. The results showed thatall observed doses were within +-3% from the absorbed dose specified.(author). 2 figs., 4 tabs., 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
