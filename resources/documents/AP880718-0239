The increase in the benchmark lending rate was the sixthhalf-point since early June, when the rate stood at 7.5 percent.The rate was last increased July 4.   The rate increases reflect the government's desire to curbinflation.   The Bank of England signaled the rise by announcing it wasraising its own money market rates.   Midland Bank PLC, Barclays Bank PLC, National Westminster BankPLC and Lloyds Bank PLC responded by announcing increases in theirrate.   Corporate borrowers can obtain loans at 1 percentage point abovethe base rate.   The pound fell, rather than rose, on the latest increase,because the market was disappointed that the central bank did notsignal a full point increase in base rates, dealers said.   The pound was trading at $1.6580 after the central bank'ssignal, down from $1.6620 just before.   Britain's annual rate rose to 4.6 percent in June from 4.2percent in the previous month, the government reported Thursday.Other recent British economic reports have indicated a rekindlingof inflation.   The dollar's recent rally, and a simultaneous decline in theBritish pound, have given the government room to increase interestrates to curb consumer spending without fear of pushing the poundup far enough to hurt British exports and corporate earnings.   The Bank of England said the rise in rates represents ``afurther tightening of monetary conditions'' but declined to specifywhat economic developments had triggered the move.   A Treasury official, who was not identified in accordance withBritish custom, said this rise continues the process of tighteningof policy that has taken place since the beginning of June. Sincethen, he stressed, base rates had risen by a full 3 points and sothere has been ``significant tightening.''</TEXT></DOC>
