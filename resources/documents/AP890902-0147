The selection of the 59-year-old former member of the Sandinistagovernment comes after two days of heated discussions byrepresentatives of the National Opposition Union, whose membersrange from communist to conservative.   Virgilio Godoy, 55-year-old leader of the Independent LiberalParty, was chosen as the coalition's vice presidential candidate.   Coalition spokesman Rene Blandon said the Chamorro-Godoy ticketreceived 10 of the 14 coalition votes, while three of the partiesabstained and one vote was annulled.   She said supporters of businessman Enrique Bolanos for the vicepresidential candidacy were refusing to accept the final vote.   ``Viva Enrique Bolanos!'' hecklers shouted while Godoy delivereda brief message outside the coalition headquarters, promising hewould fight for ``a better system of coexistence.''   Godoy was labor minister under the Sandinista government from1979 to 1984 and is regarded with hostility by some working-classgroups for introducing low wages for workers. The average monthlywage in Nicaragua is $40.   About 100 people yelled for Mrs. Chamorro at coalitionheadquarters, cheering ``Dona Violeta'' as she is known.   ``We're going to fight for amnesty, so that the jails open and sowe can have forgiveness, love and peace,'' she said.   ``Viva Pedro Joaquin Chamorro!'' she cried _ the name of herassassinated husband.   Supporters echoed her call.   Her husband's shooting death in January 1978 followed his sharpcriticism of then President Anastasio Somoza through the familynewspaper, La Prensa.   The killing of the popular Chamorro sparked a popular uprisingthat ousted Somoza in July 1979 and helped the Sandinista NationalLiberation Front into power.   ``I'm going to repeat, in memory of my husband, the one thing hewanted for Nicaragua: that Nicaragua will once again be arepublic,'' Mrs. Chamorro promised Saturday.   The fact that she does not belong to any party, her widespreadrecognition and image as a strong pro-democracy figure make her themost formidable opposition choice for the presidential nomination.   Although Bolanos and Godoy also had been mentioned as possiblepresidential contenders, each was seen as too committed to their ownideologies to be a unifying symbol for such a diverse coalition.   Bolanos, an upper-class businessman whose land has beenconfiscated by the Sandinistas, is viewed as leaning too far to theright and being too vocal a supporter of private business.   All anti-Sandinista groups agree their only chance of defeatingthe Sandinista Front is through a united opposition.   Mrs. Chamorro never has been elected to public office. Her onlyrole in government was as a member of the government junta from July19, 1979, after Somoza fled the country, to April 1980, when sheresigned, citing ill health. Since then, she has been a strongcritic of the Sandinistas.   Mrs. Chamorro has the backing of the United States. TheSandinistas have called her a puppet of Washington.   The Sandinistas have not chosen their candidate for the Februaryballoting.   They have promised free and fair elections with equal access tothe news media.   The National Opposition Union's platform calls for returningconfiscated property, dismantling the Sandinista People's Army,retaining government control of foreign trade and liberalizingdomestic commerce.</TEXT></DOC>
