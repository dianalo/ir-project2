Richard Fogel, assistant comptroller general at the GAO, which isCongress' auditing arm, also said results of an ongoing FBIinvestigation of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Chicago Boardof Trade may give a better idea of possible abuses in thecommodities pits.   The federal government has subpoenaed more than 100 traders andbrokers in connection with a sweeping undercover investigation oftrading abuses alleged to have defrauded exchange customers ofmillions of dollars.   The GAO stated the number of contracts traded at the ChicagoMercantile Exchange grew from 40 million in 1984 to 80 million in1988, and at the Chicago Board of Trade from 80 million to 140million during the same period.   The number of traders sanctioned for violations on the floor ofthe Merc rose from 13 in 1984 to 105 in 1988, while sanctions at theBoard of Trade went from a low of eight in 1985 to a high of 32 in1986. In 1988, the Board of Trade sanctioned 13 floor participants.   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., called the number of sanctions takenagainst traders ``pitiful'' given the volume of trading.   Fogel said the numbers could reflect an oversight system that isworking well or one that needs improvement because it is notdetecting abuses or punishing offenders severely enough.   Fogel's testimony came at the first Senate oversight hearing thisyear on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which oversees thecommodities markets and is up for congressional reauthorization thisyear.   The CFTC's policing of commodities markets has come under firefrom a number of critics since the federal probe was disclosedearlier this year.   Separately, Wendy Lee Gramm, chairwoman of the CFTC, said theagency has not yet responded to a request that it delay approvingnew types of futures contracts until completion of the FBI probe anda review of the commodities markets by the House AgricultureCommittee.   Gramm made her comments in response to questions from reportersfollowing a speech in New York. Earlier this week, members of theAgriculture Committee asked the agency to hold off consideringproposals it has pending.   At the hearing, Fogel said Mercantile Exchange fines for tradepractice abuses totaled $3.6 million from 1984 to 1988. For the sameperiod, comparable Board of Trade fines were $811,000.   The number of members expelled on both exchanges averaged abouttwo a year, Fogel said. He said exchange officials considerpermanent expulsion or lengthy suspensions as more severe than finesbecause they deprive members of their livelihood.   Fogel said CFTC officials told the GAO they could not comment ontheir involvement in identifying or investigating alleged abusesuntil after any indictments stemming from the FBI probe are issued.</TEXT></DOC>
