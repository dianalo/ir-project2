The acquiring companies have agreed to put up $153 million intwo separate deals and in return will acquire control of Sandamp;Ls withassets worth $4.4 billion.   Federal Home Loan Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall, who hasbeen criticized by members of Congress for agreeing to ``thindeals'' bringing little private money to Sandamp;L rescues, said, ``Themillions of dollars ... being invested ... proves again the Texasthrift market is ... an excellent business opportunity.''   However, a review of nine packages rescuing 42 Texasinstitutions this year shows that regulators have committed $22billion in aid, while bringing in capital of only about $300million.   In the biggest deal announced Friday, a joint venture headed byTemple-Inland Inc. of Dibold, Texas, is getting $1.49 billion inassistance from the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. toacquire three institutions with combined assets of $3.19 billion.   Temple-Inland, a forestry company, will get 80 percent of thenew institution's stock, while Trammel Crow Co., a Dallas-basedreal estate development and management company, and Mason Best Co.,a private merchant banking firm also based in Dallas, will get 10percent each.   Together, the three firms are investing $128 million.   In the second transaction, Club Corporation International ofDallas, one of the nation's largest operators of private dining andcountry clubs, has received a commitment from the FSLIC worth$999.5 million. For an investment of $25 million, Club is gettingcontrol of three institutions with combined assets of $1.2 billion.   In six weeks beginning Aug. 18, the FSLIC, which guarantees Sandamp;Ldeposits up to $100,000, has committed more than $16 billion toshut down or merge more than 60 institutions, including 32 in Texasand 14 in Oklahoma, states hard hit by problems in the oil industryand by lax Sandamp;L regulation.   The recent spate of transactions represent about half the 124Sandamp;L cases resolved by regulators so far this year.   Wall, the nation's top Sandamp;L regulator, had announced he wasspending as much federal assistance as possible before the 1988fiscal year ended Friday so that much of it would not count towardthe budget deficit. However, he conceded this week that he had beenmistaken and that there were only a few minor advantages to rushing.   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., has said the recent string oftransactions are a ``political shell game'' by Republicans intendedpostpone any crisis until after the election.   The bank board's spree has intensified debate over whether ataxpayer bailout of the Sandamp;L insurance fund will be needed nextyear. So far, the FSLIC has received all of its money through anassessment on the industry.   Congress' General Accounting Office has estimated it will cost$45 billion to $50 billion to clean up the industry. Of 3,000institutions nationwide, 500 are considered insolvent and another400 close to insolvent.   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, is estimatingthat if the GAO pricetag proves correct, the federal budget deficitover the next three years will be nearly $15 billion a year higher.   The Sandamp;L crisis emerged as an issue in the presidential campaignon Thursday when Democrat Michael S. Dukakis blamed the mess on thederegulation policies of the Reagan administration. The campaign ofRepublican George Bush, in turn, has attributed the problem tofoot-dragging by the Democratic Congress.   The three institutions being acquired by Temple-Inland and itspartners are: Guaranty Federal Savings and Loan Association,headquartered in Dallas with 33 branches; First Federal Savings andLoan of Austin, with 22 branches, and Delta Savings of Texas, witheight branches in and around Alvin, Texas.   Among the reasons listed by the bank board for the failure ofthe three are: high-risk lending to avoid recognizing losses,conflicts of interest, unauthorized securities trading, speculativecommercial loans, poor underwriting practices and deficient realestate appraisals.   Club International, through a wholly owned subsidiary, FirstFederal Financial Corp., is taking control of three Austin-basedSandamp;Ls: CreditBanc Savings Association, Franklin Savings Associationand Great West Savings Bank.   In two small deals in Indiana on Friday, the bank board provided$16.7 million in assistance to rescue Citizens Federal Savings andLoan Association of New Castle and United Savings Association ofCentral Indiana, Tipton.</TEXT></DOC>
