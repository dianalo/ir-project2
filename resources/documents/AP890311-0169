Wyoming attorney Gerry Spence on Friday presented arguments onone of three pretrial motions in a 1987 lawsuit in which thesteelworkers claimed to have lost wages, severance pay and insuranceand pension benefits when USX sold the Orem steel mill to a Utahcompany.   U.S. District Senior Judge Bruce Jenkins' courtroom was crowdedwith about 300 steelworkers who listened as several attorneys arguedthe merits of USX's motion for a partial summary judgment.   USX sold Geneva to Basic Manufacturing Technologies of Utah inAugust 1987, 13 months after the aging plant had been shut down by alabor dispute and subsequently placed on ``indefinate idle'' statusby USX.   The plant has operated since then under the name Geneva Steel.   The plaintiffs cited a 1986 letter mailed to every Geneva workerfrom USX Chairman David Roderick, who assured them the Utah plantwould not close its doors until the end of 1989.   They contend the letter superseded a collective bargainingagreement between the workers and the United Steelworkers of Americabecause it was an independent contract between Roderick and eachindividual worker.</TEXT></DOC>
