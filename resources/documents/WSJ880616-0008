The 13-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries still is split 8-to-5 over many issues -- with the minority consisting of Saudi Arabia and four other Persian Gulf Arab countries capable of flooding the world with oil from their enormous reserves. As a result of the division, the oil ministers left the cartel's official production limit static for the second half.    But oil ministers and other delegates still in Vienna yesterday confirmed that the four-day conference concluded Tuesday night was remarkably free of the political bickering that has torn OPEC since the war began between two of its members, Iraq and Iran, nearly eight years ago.    &quot;It was very cordial,&quot; said Fernando Santos-Alvite, Ecuador's oil minister. &quot;The ministers didn't make use of their oratorial skills.&quot; Moreover, he said, all but Iraq, which remains outside OPEC's production ceiling, formally pledged to stick to their individual quotas.    If this new cohesion holds, it improves the likelihood of adherence to production quotas. That, in turn, suggests there is little chance of a replay of the 1986 pricing war, which some oil analysts foresee in the wake of this week's feeble OPEC pact. The agreement continues current production levels for another six months despite the world oil glut.    Petroleum prices could rise, in fact, later this year if petroleum demand develops as some oil economists expect and the OPEC nations do curb quota-cheating.    &quot;This (the agreement) is the best solution if everybody adheres to it,&quot; said Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, in an interview. &quot;I'm willing to bet my money on it.&quot;    The main reason for Mr. Ginandjar's confidence is the &quot;sense of unity&quot; that he saw evolving during the four-day conference, which opened last Saturday with OPEC bitterly divided not only over second-half production levels but even over how to define production under the cartel's quota system. Despite the high note of tension early on, &quot;The atmosphere (later) was exuberant, like Christmas, when people don't want to spoil things,&quot; he said.    The Indonesian and other oil ministers said that during the final day's session, decisions were reached quickly and smoothly, with little of the political posturing that had previously been evident at OPEC meetings. Even Arturo Hernandez Grisanti, the mercurial Venezuelan oil minister -- and the Arab bloc's chief antagonist in the production-definition deadlock and over output levels as well -- adopted a conciliatory tone. And the ministers of the war foes Iran and Iraq were uncharacteristically low-key, with neither saying much.    &quot;This meeting has been good -- good in removing a lot of politics out of our organization,&quot; Sheik Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, Kuwait's oil minister, told reporters yesterday.    There were apparently other factors as well -- some tough issues were simply postponed again -- but many of the delegates credit Indonesians Subroto and Ginandjar for the lack of the usual acrimony. The selection of Mr. Subroto, Indonesia's former oil minister, as OPEC's secretary-general removed controversies that have spilled over from the Iraq-Iran war. The position had been vacant for five years, with each side claiming the right to fill it. Mr. Subroto, an economics professor and former OPEC president skilled in mediating disputes, is respected by all factions.    Mr. Ginandjar, meanwhile, apparently has stepped into the mediating role formerly held by Mr. Subroto. Other delegates said the Indonesian minister was asked to lead the effort toward compromises and that he succeeded in defusing potentially explosive situations. &quot;As a result, there were no massive confrontations&quot; in the formal sessions, said one delegate. </TEXT></DOC>
