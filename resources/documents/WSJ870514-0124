Or if striking construction workers at one site were able to halt construction not only at that site, but also at every other site around the country. The public hue and cry would be so great that Congress might be forced to pass laws prohibiting such labor action.    Fortunately, the prospect of debilitating, nationwide strikes against the airline and construction industries are remote. That's because basic federal labor law proscribes secondary boycotts against companies not directly involved in a labor dispute. So a union locked in battle with one company cannot draw every other company in the industry into the fray.    That is unless the industry happens to be the railroad industry, in which case an aggrieved union representing workers of one railroad can picket not only the offending railroad, but every other railroad in the country until it shuts down the entire industry. Such latitude is granted railway workers by the archaic Railway Labor Act that, unlike the National Labor Relations Act, permits secondary picketing by railroad unions.    This inconsistency in labor law was brought home by recent litigation pitting several major railroad companies against the Brotherhood of Maintenance of Way Employees, a rail union. The dispute arose in the wake of the union's strike against two railroads owned by Guilford Transportation Industries Inc. When the BMWE informed the major carriers that it planned to picket their facilities unless Guilford acquiesced, the carriers sought an injunction in federal district court. The Supreme Court finally ruled last week that the railway law does not give federal courts power to prohibit secondary picketing.    If secondary picketing is to be outlawed, Congress must amend the Railway Labor Act. The best thing it could do would be to strike the anachronistic law down altogether and bring railway unions under the National Labor Relations Act. In so doing, Congress would not only ensure that a local labor dispute does not break out into an industrywide skirmish, but also that Congress would not be placed in the position (as it was in the Guilford dispute) of mandating rail-labor settlements.    Imagine, again, if Congress presumed to resolve disputes in the airline or construction industries. Employers would take umbrage at such authoritarian action. Yet, Congress has repeatedly exercised such power in settling rail-labor disputes. Since 1963, Congress has passed 11 laws imposing settlements on the railroads and rail workers. Five boosted labor costs above levels that would have been likely under a more normal collective-bargaining process.    Before the partial deregulation of the railroads in 1980, carriers habitually accepted high labor costs as an excuse to apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for rate increases. But the usual result was lost business. Now, railroading itself is more competitive, as is a deregulated trucking industry.    If we are to see a viable railroad industry down the road, Congress must pare not only price regulations but also laws -- like the Railway Labor Act -- that impede rail carriers from improving productivity and reducing their cost of doing business. Otherwise the rail industry never will be able to make the full economic contribution that it is capable of making. </TEXT></DOC>
