Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said after theJudiciary Committee sent the rival measures to the floor.   The committee, by a 9-5 vote Thursday, approved the Democraticstatute to bar flag desecration but also voted 8-6 to send alongwith an unfavorable recommendation the amendment favored byPresident Bush.   A July 14 agreement between congressional leaders required thatboth measures be sent to the floor. Lawmakers plan floor action onthe bill as the last major item of business before the Senate goeson its Oct. 6 recess and plans to take up the proposed amendmentsoon after its Oct. 16 return.   Thurmond, the committee's ranking Republican, argued that theamendment as well as the proposed statute should get a favorablerecommendation.   But Joseph Biden, D-Del., the panel's chairman and sponsor of thestatute, said the amendment ``does violence to the First Amendmentbecause it is so broad.''   On Sept. 12, the House voted 380-38 to approve a similar statute.The House has not yet voted on a constitutional amendment.   The lawmakers are attempting to reverse the effects of a SupremeCourt ruling in June that threw out a Texas law used to convictflag-burning protester Gregory Lee Johnson.   Democrats, arguing against a change in the Constitution, saidnationwide interest in the issue has subsided after an initialuproar. Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said some lawmakers werebeing driven by ``politics and fear.''   ``There isn't any scourge of flag burning in this country,''Metzenbaum said. ``It isn't one of those issues that the Americanpeople are excited about.''   Yet, he said, ``we are seriously thinking of cutting back on theFirst Amendment just to avoid giving our opponents an issue. TheBill of Rights is being held hostage to negative advertising spotsin the next election.''   ``Can you imagine this?'' asked Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.``Some creep who wants publicity (burns the flag) and we seriouslythink of changing the Constitution?''</TEXT></DOC>
