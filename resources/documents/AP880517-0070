One person waskilled and several were injured.   Shops were looted and office windows smashed in Monday'sdisturbances, the official Radio Vanuatu said. Police arrested 30people, it said.   The radio said many residents spent the night outside thecapital. It said security forces today fired shots at a boat inPort Vila harbor and arrested a man who failed to stop. No furtherdetails were reported.   Police said the capital was calm today. Prime Minister WalterLini's government, meanwhile, met in emergency session.   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, is an islandgroup 930 miles northeast of Australia. It achieved independence in1980 and has a population of 130,000, including 15,000 in Port Vila.   In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke said he sent a militaryHercules plane to Vanuatu loaded with gas masks, tear gas canistersand launchers to help the government with riot control.   Hawke told the Parliament in Canberra, the federal capital, thatthe decision to send the equipment followed a direct request fromLini.   ``In a city with a population of less than 20,000 it is clearthat these disturbances have been on a very serious scale,'' Hawkesaid.   New Zealand sent similar supplies. Russell Marshall, NewZealand's foreign minister, told a news conference in Wellingtontoday that there was no thought of sending military units to quellthe disturbance.   ``There has been no request ... for military units,'' he said.``If the situation deteriorated, we'd have to look at it veryseriously.''   About 2,000 people from tribes in three villages marched onMonday through Port Vila, Radio Vanuatu said. The protest followedthe closure last week of the Vila Urban Land Corporation, agovernment agency that administered leased tribal land in thecapital, it said.   Protesters began rioting and police fired tear gas to dispersethe crowd, the radio said. A police vehicle ran over a man duringthe rioting, killing him. The radio said Lini, an Anglican priest,was not in Port Vila at the time.</TEXT></DOC>
