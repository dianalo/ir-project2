Richard Gephardt, have fallen off the pace in Iowa, the site of the first test of the 1988 campaign.    A new NBC News poll shows that Senate Republican leader Robert Dole has opened a 16-percentage-point lead, 42% to 26%, over Mr. Bush among likely participants in the Feb. 8 caucuses. The poll also shows Mr. Gephardt with the support of only 10% of likely Democratic participants, trailing Illinois Sen. Paul Simon, at 21%, and Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, at 20%.    A separate NBC survey of likely voters in New Hampshire's Feb. 16 primary provides some solace for Mr. Bush: It shows him with a 20-point lead, 41% to 21%, over Sen. Dole. But the New Hampshire poll provides no such encouragement for Mr. Gephardt, who had ridden concerns about America's foreign-trade deficit into the first tier of Democratic candidates. The survey shows that Gov. Dukakis has the support of half of New Hampshire's Democrats, with Sen. Simon second at 13% and the rest of the field with little support. Mr. Gephardt scores just 3%.    The polls, conducted from Nov. 15 to 21 among 1,705 likely voters in Iowa and 1,987 in New Hampshire, show all the Republicans but Mr. Bush and Sen. Dole and all the Democrats but Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Simon far behind.    The polls indicate that the two Republican front-runners are well known and well regarded in both states. Mr. Dole, who formally announced his candidacy a week before the polls began, gets especially high ratings from the Iowa Republicans; eight in 10 have a favorable opinion of the Kansan, while seven in 10 have a favorable impression of Mr. Bush. In New Hampshire, three of four regard the vice president favorably, while two-thirds feel the same about the Senate leader.    But the polls indicate strong negative feelings among the Republican electorate for Pat Robertson, the former religious broadcaster whose successes in early tests have worried mainstream Republicans. The surveys show Mr. Robertson with a 55% unfavorable rating among Iowa Republicans and a 61% unfavorable rating among New Hampshire Republicans. In Iowa, only one in seven born-again Protestants say they support Mr. Robertson -- lower than the support for either Mr. Dole or Mr. Bush in this group.    The polls also hold bad news for Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, whose campaign for the GOP nomination hasn't yet caught fire. Despite vigorous campaigning in both states, about a third of GOP voters say they have no opinion of him. The polls show him with only 6% support in Iowa and 8% in New Hampshire. (The surveys, which were conducted by telephone, have a margin of error of three percentage points.)    Among the Democrats, there is some evidence that Mr. Gephardt could yet rebound, despite his poor showing. Half the Iowa Democrats said they have a favorable opinion of him -- nearly four times as many as those with an unfavorable opinion. But Mr. Dukakis, with favorable ratings from six in 10 of Iowa's Democrats and three-fourths of New Hampshire's, clearly shows the most potential to build on his strength.    Rev. Jesse Jackson's push to attract support from white Iowans hurt by the state's economic crisis has won him 9% of the state's likely Democratic caucus participants. In New Hampshire, he stands at 4% in the survey.    Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee, who says he is aiming his campaign at the Southern contests that follow Iowa and New Hampshire, is the only Democratic candidate whose unfavorable ratings -- 25% in New Hampshire, 28% in Iowa -- exceed his favorable ratings.    Only about half the Democrats in both states are pleased with the selection of candidates running for their party's nomination. But Republicans in both states are overwhelmingly pleased with their candidates. </TEXT></DOC>
