The bulk of the technetium canbe removed from the resin by elution with sodium thiocyanate followedby further concentration by extraction with butan-2-one. Evaporationof solvent onto a planchette followed by measurement of emitted betaradiation can determine technetium levels. Method is capable of removingbetween 10{sup -15} and 10{sup -6}g of technetium from 500 cm{sup 3}of water.</TEXT></DOC>
