(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The hierarchy of Jimmy Swaggart's churchsaid Friday it will ask church officials in Louisiana to reconsidertheir proposed three-month suspension of the TV evangelist accusedof sexual misconduct.   G. Raymond Carlson, general superintendent of theSpringfield-based Assemblies of God, refused to say what penaltythe church recommended instead.   However, the church's Executive Presbytery had met here toconsider a tougher penalty after many members called the churchheadquarters to complain that the suspension of thefire-and-brimstone evangelist too lenient.   CBS reported Friday that the Assemblies of God told Louisianaleaders to order Swaggart, who tearfully confessed to unspecifiedsins from his pulpit Sunday, to step down a year. The network citedno sources for the report.   Assemblies of God spokeswoman Juleen Turnage late Friday saidshe did not know what the church had recommended and could notconfirm the report. Louisiana District Superintendent Cecil Janwaywas not home Friday night, said his wife.   Carlson announced the decision after 11 hours of discussion overtwo days with other members of the Executive Presbytery. Otherboard members refused comment Friday.   The home district of the Baton Rouge, La., evangelistrecommended earlier this week that Swaggart be barred frompreaching for three months and undergo two years of rehabiliationand counseling.   Once the Louisiana district has reviewed the Swaggart case, theExecutive Presbytery will take it up again, Carlson said. ``A finaldecision on these matters could be several days or weeks away,''Carlson said.   Although Swaggart and church officials never specified theevangelist's sin, an admitted prostitute said in interviews thisweek that she had performed lewd acts for Swaggart for about a year.   Church officials say no other minister accused of moralmisconduct has been allowed to return to preaching in so short atime as three months and questions were raised about the financialsupport the Louisiana district receives from Jimmy Swaggart WorldMinistries.   Two officials of the state district _ general superintendentCecil Janway, also a member of Swaggart's evangelical enterprise,and Forrest Hall, the treasurer _ met with the Executive Presbyteryon Thursday. Louisiana District officials had no comment Friday.   Turnage said earlier that if the Executive Presbytery disagreedwith the Louisiana district's recommendations, it would pass on itsconcerns to the lower body and ask officials in Louisiana toreconsider.   Mrs. Turnage said the church's constitution made thedisciplinary process a lengthy one. She said this has beenfrustrating for church members, who have flooded headquarters withcalls expressing their concern.   ``It just continues to hang there in the forefront of everyone'smind,'' she said.   Mrs. Turnage added that officials want to conclude the matter assoon as possible, ``and get out of the public spotlight.''   It is the second time in a year that the Assemblies of God, thenation's largest Pentecostal denomination, considered disciplinarymeasures against a prominent minister caught in a scandal. Lastyear, PTL founder Jim Bakker lost his Assemblies credentials afterit was disclosed that he had had sex with a woman other than hiswife and then tried to pay her to keep silent. Bakker rejected arehabilitation proposal.   Swaggart, who reaches around the world with broadcast sermonsand contributes $12 million a year to the foreign missions programsof the Assemblies of God, stepped down from his pulpit Sunday afterconfessing to an undisclosed sin.   He has not appeared in public since then and was not at theclosed meetings here.   Mrs. Turnage said the Swaggart case is the most complex ever forthe Executive Presbytery because of the many facets of Swaggart'sministry.   Swaggart records gospel albums, Bible study tapes and televisiontapes and takes his ministry abroad.   The problem, according to Mrs. Turnage, is deciding ``what ispreaching.''   `In the past, preaching meant going into the pulpit,'' she said.But with Swaggart, ``Is his singing going to be consideredpreaching? I don't know.''</TEXT></DOC>
