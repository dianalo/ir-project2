Flood waters reached the streets of affluent residentialdistricts where most of the foreign diplomats live, witnesses said.Many of the residents remained at home because flooded streetsprevent them from leaving.

At least 300,000 people have fled their homes in the countrysideand taken shelter in Dhaka after floods that inundated one-third ofBangladesh. Floods are common each year in Bangladesh and last yearkilled at least 1,500 people.   The capital remained cut off for the second day because watercovered much of the airport's runway.   The nationwide death toll from the annual floods that started inJune reached 842, news reports said. The government's toll,regarded as understated, was 300.   Independent Bengali-language newspaper, Sangbad, reported 84people had died since Friday across Bangladesh. The paper said mostof the deaths were caused by collapsing houses.   No deaths have been reported yet in Dhaka, where flood watersrange from a few inches in the center of the city to six feet inthe outskirts. Half of the city was affected.   Many residents at relief camps set up in the city complainedthat they were going hungry.   ``We have been here for the past three days, there has been nofood nor any medicines from the government,'' said Saira Banu, whohas taken shelter in a relief camp along with her four children.   On Friday, the Buriganga River, a tributary of the Ganges River,was about three inches above the flood stage, its highest level in34 years.   The Flood Forcasting and Warning Center predicted today that theriver would rise another 5.2 inches.   Residents were evaquated from low-lying areas near an embankmentthat separates Dhaka from the Buriganga.   Tens of thousands of people have taken shelter in schools,government buildings and in 125 government-run relief camps in thecity. The influx triggered fears of food shortages in the capital.</TEXT></DOC>
