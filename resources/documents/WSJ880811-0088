The measure, passed on a 307-98 vote, would direct the federal government to buy about 600 acres surrounding the Manassas National Battlefield Park in Prince William County, Va.    A private developer wants to build a 1.2 million square-foot office, shopping and residential project on that land, which was the site of Gen. Robert E. Lee's headquarters during the two Civil War Battles of Manassas. The battles, in 1861 and 1862, and also known as the Battles of Bull Run, are considered the underdog Confederate forces' greatest victories against the Union army.    The cost of the purchase would be determined through negotiations or by the courts. The current assessed value of the land is $13 million, according to the Congressional Budget Office, but &quot;the negotiated or awarded payment may be significantly higher.&quot;    In the Senate, Republican John Warner of Virginia, an influential voice on the issue, has said he would support the park expansion, which was the subject of a recent page-one article in The Wall Street Journal. </TEXT></DOC>
