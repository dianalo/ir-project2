Illinois Gov. James R. Thompson toured Allendale and said heplanned to declare the town a state disaster area on Monday. He alsosent about 100 National Guardmen to prevent looting and help cleanup the town, where more than a third of the homes and commercialbuildings were destroyed in the Saturday evening storm.   ``It's a mess. It's awful,'' Thompson said.   ``It looks like this place has been bombed,'' said Jack Loeffler,mayor of the community in southeastern Illinois.   In Indiana, three people were injured in one county, and anothercounty estimated damage at half a million dollars. In south-centralKentucky, a twister caused at least $10 million in damage tobusinesses and homes in and around Franklin.   Tornadoes in wintertime are unusual but not unheard of, accordingto officials at the National Weather Service. A tornado Dec. 24killed one person, injured 15 and destroyed 20 buildings in twoNashville, Tenn., suburbs.   In Allendale, about 130 miles east of St. Louis near the Indianaborder, a tornado Saturday evening cut through a 10-block area thatmakes up about half the town of 600, leveling buildings anduprooting dozens of trees.   Loeffler said 53 homes and nine businesses were destroyed. Anadditional 28 homes were severely damaged and 30 sustained somedamage. The post office, fire station, city hall and a school wereall destroyed, he said.   ``The east half of the town's gone,'' said Marvin Jones, anambulance driver. ``Most of the streets are blocked by wires andtrees and debris. ... Belongings are scattered everywhere.''   ``It's a mess is all you you can say,'' said a resident, LindaGriesemer.   Six to eight people were trapped in the rubble but were rescuedSaturday evening and brought to hospitals, Loeffler said.   ``We feel very fortunate. To the best of our knowledge, therehave been no fatalities,'' the mayor said.   About 45 people from in and around Allendale, including at leastsix children, were treated at Wabash General Hospital in MountCarmel, said spokeswoman Elaine Shaw. Four were treated at LawrenceCounty Memorial Hospital in Lawrenceville.   Twenty-seven patients remained hospitalized Sunday at Wabash andseven at other hospitals, Ms. Shaw said. She said some were incritical condition, but did not know how many.   In Indiana, the same storm system spawned a twister that injuredthree people and damaged or destroyed 30 homes and about 25 to 30farm buildings in the St. Thomas area southeast of Vincennes insouthwestern Indiana.   The injured were treated at a hospital and released.   The twister came within a mile of a highs school, where 2,500people were watching a basketball game when the storm knocked thepower out.   Later, near Forest Hill in central Indiana, the storm damagedseveral houses and farm buildings in a sparsely populated area,causing an estimated $500,000 damage, said Sheriff's Deputy JimBaylis. No injuries were reported.   In south-central Kentucky, a tornado struck near midnight inoutlying areas of Franklin, causing an estimated $10 million to $12million in damage to businesses and homes, Simpson CountyJudge-Executive Ken Harper said Sunday.   ``Miraculously, no one was injured,'' Harper said after touringthe stricken areas in the community of 7,700.   The roof was blown off an ambulance garage at theFranklin-Simpson Memorial Hospital. Damage also was reported to 25homes and to 15 businesses in and near Franklin.   Gov. Wallace Wilkinson authorized sending Kentucky National Guardtroops to help prevent looting and keep traffic flowing, said DavidAdkinson, operations manager for Kentucky Disaster and EmergencyServices.   About 20 military police officers from the guard's Louisvilleunit were being sent to Franklin, he said.   Minutes before the twister tore through Allendale, tornadoes hitnearby Mill Shoals and Albion, officials said.   In Mill Shoals, two or three mobile homes were overturned and acouple of homes and several farm buildings were damaged, said statepolice Sgt. John Muensterman. In Albion, five buildings weredamaged, said Mayor Earl Bailey.
