 John Murtha (D-Pa.), chairman of the HouseAppropriations Subcommittee on Defense.andM;Specifically, AFATDS will provide the Army with a computerized fire controland command system capable of coordinating more than 300 battlefield tasks,many related to calculating a number of artillery targets simultaneously.andM;The system will replace the Army's current TACFIRE system.andP;  The Armyconsiders the late-1970s TACFIRE system inadequate because it lacksdistributed processing capability, is too large and heavy and has limitedfunctional capability.andM;The Army estimates AFATDS will cost $400 million.andP;  Including in-house officesupport the cost already is at $103 million and climbing, the GAO said.andM;GAO criticized both the Army and its contractor, Magnavox Electronic Systems,Fort Wayne, Ind., for continued delays in the development of AFATDS andtermed the 1992 target date for fielding &quot;optimistic.&quot;andM;GAO said that the Concept Evaluation Phase of the system is now two yearsbehind schedule and that fielding will have to take place before the AFATDSsoftware is developed.andP;  The report questioned whether the development andinitial transfer of software could be accomplished on the Army's $41.7million budget for the development and transfer segment of the program.andM;The report criticized the transfer of new software from a computer used todevelop it to the Common Hardware and Software (CHS) computer on which itwill run.andM;&quot;Computers used for software development include three main processors, whichhave a cumulative speed of 9 million instructions per second and cumulativelyhave more than 54 megabytes of random access memory.andP;  The CHS computer ...andO;has one main processor with a processing speed of 4 million instructions persecond and 16 megabytes of random access memory.&quot;andM;More computers would likely be needed, the report said.andM;GAO questioned the usefulness of CHS operating system software &quot;becauseAFATDS has a large, near real-time, or virtually instantaneous, processingrequirement.&quot;andP;  GAO said the Army agreed that to meet the requirement, theoperating system software may need to be replaced.andM;As in a 1987 GAO report, auditors contrasted AFATDS' delayed development withan interim system known as Light TACFIRE, now implemented within the 9thInfantry Division, headquartered at Fort Lewis, Tacoma, Wash.andM;Developed by Litton Data Systems, Van Nuys, Calif., the system is operatedfrom a briefcase terminal.andP;  &quot;Menu-driven formats and the ability to allowdirect data input with a map digitizer by pointing to a map with an'electronic pencil' simplify its use,&quot; the report said.andM;AFATDS is to replace Light TACFIRE in 1994.andP;  As designed, AFATDS also willserve heavy divisions.andM;John Williams, program manager for Magnavox, said neither his company nor theArmy ever assumed that the software would be transferred without additionalCHS requirements.andM;&quot;We won't know how many computers we'll need until we get on a CHS, do somebenchmarking, find out the capabilities of the test bed, and then you mightbe able to say, for instance, that for a brigade fire support element in acertain operational facility you would need X number of computers to do thejob,&quot; he said.andM;Qualification testing of the Concept Evaluation Phase software, which nowcontains more than 1 million lines of Ada code, was performed successfully inDecember.andP;  Williams agreed the program has been delayed two years but, notingits size, said, &quot;If it wasn't for these GAO reports, no one would pay muchattention to the fact that some delays occurred.&quot;andM;Lt.andP;  Col.andP;  Dave Peterson, weapons system manager for AFATDS, said he isdrafting a reply to the GAO report.andP;  Peterson said, &quot;It's a very biasedreport in that it does not deal with the functionality of an automationsystem for field artillery.&quot;andM;Peterson said Light TACFIRE will not function unless it is linked to an oldTACFIRE system.andP;  &quot;Light TACFIRE will not work by itself,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It'sjust some boxes.andP;  They need something with a bigger computing power.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
