Boone Pickens Jr., said it extended its tender offer for 28 million Newmont Mining Corp. shares until Nov. 12 while an appeal is pending before the Delaware Supreme Court.    The $72-a-share offer for Newmont was scheduled to expire yesterday. The partnership said about 6.2 million Newmont shares had been tendered by the close of business Wednesday.    As previously reported, the partners have appealed a Delaware Chancery Court ruling that allowed Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, a London-based gold concern, to increase its stake in New York-based Newmont to 49.7% through a &quot;Street sweep.&quot; Gold Fields owned 26.2% of Newmont before it bought up all the Newmont shares it could in late September.    The Delaware Supreme Court has agreed to hear the appeal, but a hearing date hasn't been set.    Ivanhoe's offer is contingent on 28 million shares being tendered, enough to give it a majority of Newmont. Ivanhoe currently owns 6.65 million Newmont shares, or 9.95% of the company. Amarillo, Texas-based Mesa Limited Partnership, with Mr. Pickens as general partner, is the lead investor in Ivanhoe. </TEXT></DOC>
