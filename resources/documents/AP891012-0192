Sara Shingler, head of the United Methodist Church InfantFormula Task Force, said that in all 16 countries studied,``researchers found that the major manufacturers of breast-milksubstitutes _ Nestle, Abbott, American Home Products andMead-Johnson _ were deficient in some degree with requirements ofthe code.''   The World Health Organization's Code on the Marketing of BreastMilk Substitutes was adopted by member countries, major formulamanufacturers and international distributors in 1981.   A spokesman for Nestle, Greee Chaffee, said officials had notseen the study and had no comment on it.   A representative of American Home Products, Carol Emering, saidthat ``in developing countries, we comply fully with the WHOcode.'' She said the company has had no more than four complaintsannually since the company adopted the code.   Cathy Babington, a spokeswoman for Abbott, declined comment,saying company officials had not received the report. Efforts toreach Mead-Johnson were unsuccessful.   The WHO code sets gives national governments primaryresponsibility for distribution of nutritional information andprohibits government or manufacturers' use of pictures of infantsor written materials idealizing or promoting use of infant formula.The code also stipulates that product labels must includeinstructions on proper preparation and use of the formula and mustemphasize the nutritional superiority of breast feeding.   In addition, retail outlets cannot use distributors' displays,advertisements or employees. Nor can doctors or health facilitiesdistribute manufacturers' samples or formula information.   In practice, Shingler said, ``The study, which involved 2,108interviews in hospitals, clinics, retail outlets, foreigngovernment agencies and with individual physicians, revealedproblems of compliance in all the countries studied.''   The three-year study concludes that:   _More than half of the mothers interviewed had received nonutritional information about themselves and their children fromgovernment health agencies.   _Information provided by both governments and formula makersdidn't let people know the financial implications of using formulaor the difficulty in reversing a decision to bottle feed.   _Manufacturers, retailers, doctors, health-care facilities andgovernments violated prohibitions or restrictions in theirpromotion, advertising and marketing procedures.   _Fewer than a third of the labels on formula cans included anexpiration date.   However, ``where the governmental agencies responsible forhealth care made a firm effort to comply with the code, themanufacturers improved their level of compliance,'' said Shingler.   ``The companies will do as much as they are required,'' saidDouglas Johnson, task force researcher at a news conferenceThursday.   But Johnson said governments defend lax enforcement because``their argument is that they do not have enough people and thatthe government needs money also.''   The countries included in the study were: Argentina, Brazil,Chile, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, PapuaNew Guinea, Philippines, Taiwan, Thailand, Venezuela, Ghana,Swaziland and South Africa.   Members of the United Methodist Church's General Board of Churchand Society and independent infant formula experts serve on thesix-member church task force, which has studied infant formulausage and marketing since 1980.</TEXT></DOC>
