(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An honor roll student searching for away to protest his school's dress code found something his motherwould think natty _ a bright red pair of her culottes.   ``They're saying we can't wear shorts, but girls can wear skirtsthat are shorter than shorts, so they're indirectly discriminatingagainst guys,'' said Aaron Martinez, who was sent home Thursdaywhen he showed up in school sporting the outfit.   On Friday, five other boys joined his protest by going to schoolin skirts.   School officials told them to change their clothing or go home.Two went home, while the others changed to pants and went to class,said principal Gary Blocker.   The School Board's student dress policy clearly states thatculottes _ sometimes referred to as ``split skirts'' _ arepermissible. The policy does not say that only girls can wearculottes to school.   ``Culottes are for girls,'' Blocker said. ``The handbook doesn'tsay that, but that's what is meant. It might be sex discrimination,but it's disruptive to the school.''   Martinez, a member of the baseball team and captain of thesoccer team, said he feels ``more comfortable in shorts than injeans. I never wear long pants unless I have to.''   ``The kids in California are allowed to wear shorts to school,''he said. ``I guess they're a bunch of illiterate dropouts becauseof it.''   The School Board has scheduled a public hearing next week toconsider changes to the student dress policy.</TEXT></DOC>
