Apple Computer Inc.'s earnings were more than double the year-earlier level, Motorola Inc.'s earnings jumped 62%, although that was less than most analysts expected, and Microsoft Corp.'s profit surged 79%. Unisys Corp. posted a profit for the quarter, reversing a year-earlier loss.    News of Motorola's results contributed to a sharp drop in the stock market, including a 57.20-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrials Average. Recent disappointing results from computer giants International Business Machines Corp., Armonk, N.Y., and Digital Equipment Corp., Maynard, Mass., continued to serve as a drag on both technology shares and the broader market.    Analysts said that technology stocks fell yesterday because of investor fears that earnings of those companies have peaked until at least a year from now.    &quot;In a bear market, there's only bad news,&quot; said John C. Maxwell III, securities analyst with Dillon Read andamp; Co. &quot;Investors are discounting the good results because, in the shadow of IBM's performance, they don't think they'll happen again soon.&quot;    Apple skidded $3, to $39.75, and Microsoft fell $3.25, to $54, in national over-the-counter trading. Motorola dropped $4.50, to $40.875, and Unisys was down $1.625, to $30.75, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Apple Computer   Apple Computer, for the second quarter in a row, reported record sales and profit, once again outstripping even the most optimistic expectations on Wall Street.    The Cupertino, Calif.-based maker of personal computers said its net income more than doubled in its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 1. The company's blockbuster quarter signals continued strength in the market for microcomputers, at a time when industry analysts see demand slowing for the more powerful midrange and mainframe systems.    Apple's net in the period rose to $121.4 million, or 92 cents a share, from $58.5 million, or 45 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue jumped 57% to $1.04 billion, from $662.3 million a year ago. Most computer analysts had expected Apple to post earnings of about 80 cents to 90 cents a share on revenue of between $900 million and $1 billion.    &quot;Outstanding,&quot; said Daniel Benton, sucurities analyst with Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Mr. Benton had forecast revenue of about $1 billion. &quot;Their products were strong across the board,&quot; he said.    Apple's surging revenue stemmed largely from surprisingly strong sales of its Apple IIGS and Macintosh SE machines, according to Mr. Benton of Goldman Sachs. He estimated that the company shipped about 100,000 Apple IIGS computers in its recent quarter, accounting for between $100 million and $150 million of its revenue. That was twice the sales clip that Mr. Benton has been expecting.    &quot;We had all forgotten about the IIGS,&quot; he said.    Mr. Benton estimated that Apple shipped a total of about 190,000 Macintosh SE and Macintosh Plus computers, about 10% more than the analyst had forecast for the period.    The success of the Apple machines -- and the company's profit leap -- underscores key differences between Apple and its larger competitors, such as IBM and Digital. In fact, many analysts say the latter companies' troubles may actually bode well for Apple. That's because Apple's microcomputers, which have been significantly enhanced in the past 12 months, are starting to make inroads into the midrange-computer strongholds of Digital and IBM, analysts say.    For example, Apple's Macintosh II machine is now comparable in speed to a high-end IBM mainframe of just a decade ago, according to Mr. Benton of Goldman Sachs. &quot;And the micros offer 10 to 40 times the price/performance of the minis,&quot; he said.    Motorola   Net for the quarter rose to $102 million, or 79 cents a share, from $63 million, or 49 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 14% to $1.85 billion from $1.62 billion.    &quot;The market right now isn't taking bad news well,&quot; said Andrew Kessler, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.    Some of the bad news: Fourth-quarter operating profit for the government electronics group fell sharply, due in part to continued costs to beef up compliance with stricter government rules on defense contracts.    Motorola, based in Schaumburg, Ill., wouldn't comment on why results fell short of expectations. But Thomas Thornhill, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., said the defense group was forced to delay shipments of some products because of quality problems with some vendor parts. He said Motorola's results were also depressed by shortages of some parts used by the communication group. In both cases, Mr. Thornhill said, the delay in shipping products in the fourth quarter should benefit first-quarter results.    Despite being surprised by the results, analysts said Motorola's businesses were fundamentally sound in the quarter. They said that sales and orders were particularly strong in the communications group and the semiconductor group, which continues to benefit from the chip industry recovery. &quot;The shortfalls are primarily onetime events,&quot; said Mr. Thornhill. &quot;The tone of the ongoing business is quite strong.&quot;    For all of 1987, net rose 59% to $308 million, or $2.39 a share, from $194 million, or $1.53 a share. Sales were $6.71 billion, up 14% from $5.89 billion.    Microsoft   Microsoft said an &quot;unusually robust&quot; personal computer market helped the software concern post a 79% earnings increase for its fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.    The Redmond, Wash.-based company said net was $35.3 million, or 63 cents a share, up sharply from $19.7 million, or 35 cents a share. Year-ago per-share figures have been adjusted to reflect a 2-for-1 stock split paid in September.    Revenue jumped 92% to $155.9 million from $81 million.    The company's results are &quot;fabulous,&quot; said Montgomery Securities analyst William Shattuck, who thinks stocks in the personal-computer field hold promise, despite problems at some makers of larger models. Smith Barney analyst David Readerman called Microsoft's revenue &quot;absolutely awesome.&quot;    Microsoft supplies the operating system software, which directs the flow of data in a computer and its memory devices, that is bundled with most IBM personal computers and compatible machines. The surge in personal computers thus directly boosts the company's fortunes.    Microsoft also makes software for specific applications, such as word-processing, file management and financial analysis. The company said sales of new applications products released during the latest period also contributed to the earnings surge.    Microsoft also introduced during the quarter OS/2, a second-generation operating system for high-performance IBM PCs. Copies of a preliminary version of the long-awaited product were shipped to computer manufacturers beginning in December, but aren't thought to have generated any significant revenues in the period.    For the six months, net rose 59% to $56.6 million, or $1.02 a share, from $35.5 million, or 64 cents a share. Revenue rose 75% to $258.5 million from $147.8 million.    Unisys Corp.    Unisys Corp. reported fourth-quarter net of $216.9 million, or $1.26 a share, reflecting cost savings from a corporate restructuring and strength in computer orders during the quarter.    A year earlier Unisys, created through the merger of Burroughs Corp. and Sperry Corp., had a net loss of $188.5 million on $2.54 billion in revenue, reflecting a $280 million charge for restructuring following the merger.    Unisys, based in Blue Bell, Pa., said its computer business, which accounts for 75% of the company's total business, increased sharply in the fourth quarter because of an increase in both domestic and foreign orders. Unisys derives 25% of its business from defense systems.    The company's fourth-quarter revenue, aided by a weaker dollar, rose 16% to $2.8 billion.    W. Michael Blumenthal, chairman and chief executive, said in 1988 the company expects double-digit earnings growth because of continued cost savings, improved efficiencies, and new products. &quot;We expect to double the number of major product announcements in 1988 resulting in accelerated revenue growth in the second half and into 1989,&quot; he said.    For the year, net totaled $578 million, or $3.15 a share, in contrast to a year-earlier loss of $43.4 million. Revenue rose to $9.71 billion from $7.43 billion. Revenue from continuing businesses rose 6.7% for the year. </TEXT></DOC>
