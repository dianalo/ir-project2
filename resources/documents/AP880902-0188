VERNACI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, gearing up for ``a very tough, verycompetitive'' general election campaign, announced Friday he wasrehiring John Sasso, his longtime political strategist who resignedafter anonymously triggering events that forced Sen. Joseph Bidenout of the Democratic primary campaign.   ``It's going to be a battle royal for the presidency of theUnited States,'' Dukakis said, announcing that his pugnaciousformer campaign manager was returning as vice chairman of hiscampaign.   Sasso's return came as Republican opponent George Bush keptpounding away at the Massachusetts governor, and amid polls thatshowed Dukakis and Bush were locked in a dead-heat with the LaborDay campaign kickoff just days away.   Standing on a New Jersey beach Friday, the GOP nominee accusedDukakis of contributing to its occasional pollution by arranging tohave sludge from Massachusetts dumped in nearby ocean waters.   ``Almost a year ago, John Sasso made a very serious mistake,''Dukakis said in California. ``He's paid the price.''   Sasso stepped down last year after admitting that he distributeda videotape showing that Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, then acandidate for the Democratic presidential nomination, had borrowedvirtually verbatim excerpts from a speech once delivered by BritishLabor Party leader Neil Kinnock.   That videotape and subsequent charges of plagiarism forced Bidento drop out of the race.   Dukakis said Biden ``could not have been more gracious'' whentold that Sasso was returning to his campaign.   Biden, in a statement issued by his Senate office, said, ``Icontinue to support Governor Dukakis.''   Sasso, speaking at a news conference in Boston with campaignchairman Paul Brountas and manager Susan Estrich, apologized forthe incident and said he did not intend to raise questions aboutBiden's character.   Dukakis has seen his double-digit lead over Bush in the pollsevaporate since the Republican National Convention last month, whenthe GOP launched a sustained attack on the Democratic nominee.   Nevertheless, Dukakis said Sasso's return was not a reflectionof disarray in his campaign.   ``It's simply the fact we're looking at a little more than twomonths of what is going to be a very tough, very competitivecampaign,'' Dukakis said, adding that he wanted to assemble ``thestrongest team I possibly can.''   Craig Fuller, Bush's chief of staff, said the return of Sasso``speaks for itself.'' But GOP vice presidential nominee Dan Quaylewas more blunt: ``I would say that this is another sign that theDukakis campaign is in serious trouble.''   Bush stood Friday before a group of supporters clad in beachattire to keep up his attack on Dukakis' environmental record.   ``For almost two years, he fought to allow Boston's sludge to bedumped off New Jersey's shore _ the very shore on which he had thenerve to stand and promise clean water,'' Bush said. ``Nice guy _yeah.''   Bush spoke on a beach at Belmar, N.J., which has been closedfrom time to time because of sludge that was dumped off the coastand then drifted ashore.   ``Why did you pledge a clean ocean to the people of New Jerseywhen your own state applied to pollute it?'' Bush asked.   While Dukakis applied in 1985 to have his state's sludge dumped106 miles off the New Jersey coast, a later agreement allowedMassachusetts to unload it farther out to sea, beyond thecontinental shelf.   Earlier in the week, Bush sailed into heavily polluted BostonHarbor and accused Dukakis of neglect and stalling and doing toolittle to clean up the waters of his own home port.   The vice president appears intent on wooing members of Dukakis'own Greek-American constituency. A Bush campaign official triedwithout success to recruit an employee of the federally financedVoice of America to translate the GOP candidate's speeches andstatements into Greek.   The employee, George Bistis, did not accept the offer, and theVOA general counsel warned in a memorandum that any VOA staffertaking such an assignment would be violating the Hatch Act, whichbars federal workers from taking part in partisan politicalcampaigns.   ``I find it highly objectionable that any political organizationshould feel free to fish around in the VOA for translators ofpartisan political material,'' Andreas Antypas, deputy chief ofVOA's European division, wrote in a memo obtained by The AssociatedPress.</TEXT></DOC>
