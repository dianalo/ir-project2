MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   No cover needed, President Bush said of hisNew Year's vacation _ he'd earned it with hard work. Even so,presidents and their image-makers always are at pains to point outthe press of daily duty that travels with them.   So it was as Bush took his customary end-of-the-year break inTexas, a holiday that ended Monday night. He said there had been noreason to change it because of U.S. intervention in Panama. Bushspent New Year's weekend in Houston, flying to San Antonio onSunday to visit wounded servicemen at two military hospitals.   ``Things have gone well. It's winding down,'' he had said as hisvacation began last Wednesday. ``I am in close touch by _ veryclose touch _ by telephone, by secure links.   ``And the secretary of state is here, and we have some importantthings to go over. So I _ it never occurred to me,'' he told aquestioner at an airport news conference.   ``Now, if the matter were still going and there was a lot offighting and Noriega was not in custody, it would have beendifferent. But I _ look, I don't make any cover.   ``I'm going to be enjoying myself, and I think the Americanpeople understand that. And I think I've worked pretty hard allyear long, so I'll keep on this path, and I hope it's correct.''   Then Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III went fishingand hunted quail, as they have for 20 years, at the ranch of amutual friend near Beeville, Texas.   Out of town and off work, but never out of touch, his spokesmansaid. This administration, like its predecessors, misses noopportunity to point out the rigors of the job and the way they canbe handled far from Washington, on business or pleasure.   ``He receives intelligence briefings every morning and, ofcourse, a continual stream of paperwork that includes reports fromthe State Department and the Pentagon and other agencies ofgovernment,'' White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.   ``The president also ... has a secure telephone system there atthe ranch, and is able to make telephone calls on a secure basis toleaders around the world and other members of the administration.He has with him his military aide and his personal aide who alsomaintain contact with various officials of government.   ``We always take the position that the presidency goes with thepresident, but be that as it may, certainly the president is ableto respond to any international situation at any time,'' Fitzwatersaid.   Just then, a telephone rang, interrupting his briefing.   ``And there he is now,'' Fitzwater cracked. ``Tell him I`mbusy.''   Bush spent his summer vacation, 20 days of it, at Kennebunkport,Maine, displaying his way of relaxing at top speed. He wentfishing, golfing, jogging, boating, played tennis, played ball,dined out, all in a sort of semi-public summer break thatcontrasted sharply with the solitude some presidents have sought.   Ronald Reagan spent the equivalent of 11 months in the isolationof his Santa Barbara, Calif., ranch during the eight years he waspresident.   The vacationing Bush is more public and more active. But he wasout of the public eye and 60 miles from his traveling staffentourage during his three days at the Lazy F Ranch. His huntingdays began at about 6 a.m., with written intelligence briefings.Before 9, he and Baker were out after quail, even on a foggy Texasmorning.   ``This man has eyes that can see through steel girders, letalone fog,'' Fitzwater joked.   ``Did he hit any?''   The question went unanswered.   The White House has been sticking to announced schedules, withadjustments but with no major changes or cancellations because ofthe Panama situation, as if to play down any air of crisis becauseof the military operation.   With one big break for the administration, it worked. Just whenthe operation seemed to be facing unanticipated resistance, Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega, the ousted military boss, emerged fromhiding and took refuge at the Vatican embassy.   But the business-and-holiday-as-usual schedule did produce onebad televised scene. Bush, about to leave for a Camp DavidChristmas weekend, bantered with reporters following a White Housepress conference. Meanwhile, split TV screens showed theflag-draped coffins of American servicemen arriving home fromPanama.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
