A growing body of evidencethus indicates that in 1977, coincidentally with Marshal N.V. Ogarkov'selevation to Chief of the General Staff, the Soviets adopted an independentconventional war option as a long-term military development goal. Ogarkovand others now speak of a new revolution in Soviet military affairs thatinvolves changes in Soviet doctrine generated by the so-called emergingtechnologies and the trend toward new, conventional means. The most-prominentSoviet military figures now equate the new conventional means with nuclearweapons in terms of tasks, ranges, and target sets. A review of Sovietmilitary writings in the 1980s further indicates that the new conventionalmeans will be used in a war that involves neither the territories northe nuclear forces of the superpowers.</TEXT></DOC>
