It was difficult to gauge precise Euromarket price levels, however, as nearly no trading took place. The U.S. Treasury's 8 7/8 bonds of 1997, an issue often used as a guide by Eurobond traders, were down nearly 1/2 point late in the European session.    An official at a Japanese securities firm said the lack of activity during the final weeks of December meant traders would have to &quot;try to find the right levels&quot; for Eurobond quotes after business resumes this week. And that could mean the market reopening will be volatile, he added.    In contrast to past years, underwriters didn't attempt any last minute &quot;league table specials,&quot; or offerings designed primarily to bolster their standing according to annual Eurobond volume --a reflection of how difficult it would have been to sell bonds, dealers said. Among limiting factors were the volatility of the dollar and Treasury markets and the absence, to a greater extent than usual, of market participants. </TEXT></DOC>
