Deskpro 386/25 with a file allocation table (FAT) file system.andO;Each workstation was configured as both database server a d client.andM;Both systems contained 6M bytes of RAM.andP;  Communications were run on aToken-Ring network using IBM 4M-bps adapter cards.andM;Database ServicesandM;Database Manager's back-end server component is similar in structure andconcept to IBM's mainframe dB2 database.andP;  Like DB2, it is controlled by SQLstatements passed from an application program.andM;The commands may be issued as either static SQL--hard-coded in theapplication program and precompiled--or as dynamic SQL, which is interpretedat run time.andP;  The former approach is more efficient, the latter more flexiblewhen instructions depend on run-time conditions.andM;SQL commands can be issued from programs written for IBM versions of C,COBOL, FORTRAN and Pascal compilers, and the REXX interpreter.andP;  OS/2 EEincludes the REXX interpreter and a precompiler for the other languages.andM;The precompiler converts embedded SQL statements into syntax acceptable tothe host language, the resulting program must then be compiled into anexecutable file using the appropriate compiler.andM;Database Manager's sQL is compatible with that of DB2, so applications can bereadily ported between platforms.andP;  The major differences result fromextensions in Database Manager that support referential integrity.andM;In a multitable database, records in one table often refer to records in aparent table.andP;  Referential integrity ensures that each reference points to avalid, existing record in the target table.andM;Amajor enhancement in Database Manager is the implementation of referentialintegrity within the database definition, instead of in procedures thatupdate the database.andP;  When a referential constraint is defined, a dependentrecord cannot be added to a table unless the parent record exists.andM;The constraint specifies how to handle deletions of records that havedependents--delete all the dependents, set the dependent references to nullvalues or disallow the deletion.andP;  The deletion constraints are set independent tables, and deleting a record with dependents in more than onetable can have different effects in each table.andM;Under concurrent access, resource locking is automatically applied at theminimum level needed to maintain integrity.andP;  A program can explicitly requesta higher-level lock, and any attempts to access a locked resource will besuspended until that resource is available.andP;  This is acceptable where thecontending processes are correctly written programs, but may hang upworkstations under interactive use.andM;Indefinite waits can cause deadlocks, in which two or more processes wait forthe release of mutually locked resources.andP;  Such an impasse is broken byDatabase Services' automatic deadlock detector, which arbitraraily terminatesone transaction and rolls back any work in progress to the previous point ofconsistency.andM;The process that initiated the terminated transaction receives an error code;how the program reacts to the termination is left up to the programmer.andM;The frequency of testing for deadlock can be adjusted by the systemadministrator.andM;Query ManagerandM;Query Manager is a PM program that provides an interactive user interface tomany of the facilities of Database Services.andP;  However, it is not the nimble,interactive, easy-to-use database manager that users have come to expect fromother microcomputer DBMS products.andM;It is possible to create and maintain fairly complex databases using only themenu-driven interface of Query Manager.andP;  However, Query Manager'scapabilities are much too inflexible for practically anything but thesimplest of applications.andM;Query Manager's menu-driven interface for creating database objects istedious to use.andP;  Clicking on multiple-choice radio buttons is helpful thefirst few times, but soon becomes time-consuming.andM;The only alternative is to write Create statements in SQL, which requiresusers to remember the details of a rigid syntax.andP;  A middle ground, perhapssimilar to the fill-in-the-blanks approach of dBASE or Paradox, would be mostwelcome.andM;One of Query Manager's saving graces is that it can convert the sequence ofmenu actions used to create a table or view into SQL statements and save themfor future use, for example, for re-creating the table on the same or anothersystem.andM;Unlike the interactive nature of other PC-based DBMSs, Query Manager does notprovide for easy modification of the database structure.andP;  A new column can beadded to an existing table, but changing column names and widths, orconverting a column from one data type to another, requires creating a newtable and copying data from the old table with appropriate SQL statements.andM;Query Manager provides a set of predefined forms for queries, reports andscreens and also allows customized procedures.andP;  The creation process ismenu-driven and requires excessive keyboard or mouse activity.andP;  Theadvantage, however, is that it can produce a high-quality PM databaseinterface with no programming effort.andM;Screen panels, which are PM windows, can collect data from multiple tables ofa database.andP;  One-to-many relationships are easy to incorporate on one screenwithout any programming.andP;  The panel may include a subsidiary window forscrolling through any number of dependent records.andP;  The size of the windowdetermines the number of dependent records visible at one time.andP;  The size isfixed when the panel is created and cannot be changed by the user.andM;Queries and reports can be created by either pointing and clicking on aseries of menus--called prompted queries--or by directly entering SQLstatements.andP;  Queries and reports created by the prompted-query method canlater be converted to SQL statements, but cannot be converted from SQL totheir original form.andM;Applications that consist of query, reporting and screen-form facilities maybe automated using procedures written in the Query Manager procedurallanguage.andP;  The language has two types of statements: commands that manipulateobjects and data in the database; and programming constructs that control theflow of execution within the procedure.andM;Although the procedure language does not support embedded SQL directly, itdoes allow running prerecorded queries and reports saved in either promptedor SQL format.andM;The limited capabilities of the procedure language make it suitable only forfairly simple applications.andP;  Complex applications written in C, COBOL,FORTRAN, Pascal or REXX can use Query Manager's easy interfaces via theCallable Interface, a set of procedures that pass commands to and receiveresults from one or more instances of Query Manager.andM;Most users will find that the interactive operations of Query Manager are farbelow the convenience standards of most microcomputer database programs.andP;  Therigidity of server SQL databases has, unfortunately, been carried over to theinteractive end.andM;A screen form can be used to browse through a database's records for thepurpose of modifying or deleting existing records, but browsing can only bedone in the forward direction.andP;  Returning to a previous record requires theuser to issue a search command by calling up a blank form and entering searchconditions.andM;Although Query Manager uses the relational terminology of tables, rows andcolumns, it does not implement the very useful paradigm of tabular updates,which are displayed in spreadsheet fashion.andP;  A tabular display can beobtained only as the result of a query, but then the data cannot be changed.andM;Query Manager's biggest disappointment is its batch-oriented concurrencycontrol.andP;  In an interactive environment, forcing users to wait indefinitelyfor the release of data locks is not a practical implementation because thelocking process is not necessarily a well-behaved program that completes itsupdates within seconds.andP;  The preferred method would be for Query Manager toreceive an error code, allowing the user of procedure to determine whether towait and retry or give up.andM;Query Manager's resolution of deadlocks is even more severe.andP;  When the serverdetects a deadlock condition, it rolls back and terminates one of thedeadlocked transactions with an error code.andP;  When Query Manager receives theerror code, it posts a message to the screen then terminates, closing thedatabase and exiting to the OS/2 Desktop Manager.andP;  IBM is addressing thisproblem and intends to rectify it in a future version, according to sources.andM;Remote Data ServicesandM;Communications between server and workstations are not implemented with theprotocol used by the network control component of OS/2, but with the APPCprotocol.andP;  The physical connections, however, can be made over LAN wiringusing either Token-Ring or Ethernet hardware.andP;  APPC and LAN systemcommunications can coexist on the same wiring.andM;Configuring the Remote Data Services connections is not difficult, but it canbe tedious and requires careful planning.andP;  The names of remote databases, aswell as the logical names of the servers on which they reside, must beindividually entered at each client workstation.andP;  This can be done witheither a custom application program or the Query Manager, which provides aninteractive menu-driven interface for the configuration.andM;In addition, the Communications Manager program on each workstation must beconfigured with the network address of each server.andP;  This address can be thephysical address of the server's network adapter or a logical addressassigned by the administrator.andM;Once the connections are properly configures, accessing remote databases istransparent to the application, whether it was implemented with Query Manageror by means of a customized application program.andP;  The only restriction isthat databases must be created or destroyed locally.andP;  However, a remotedatabase may be restructured by adding, deleting or modifying its components.andM;Remote Data Services reduces network traffic by returning only the results ofqueries and executing procedures remotely at the server, using a facilitycalled Application Remote Interface (ARI).andP;  Instead of sending long sequencesof SQL code to the server, the workstation can request the execution of aserver-resident procedure.andM;This concept is similar to the stored procedures of Microsoft's SQL Server,but while stored procedures are associated with a database, each ARIprocedure is associated with a particular database application.andM;Remote procedures reside in dynamic link libraries on the server, and can becalled from application programs written in C, COBOL or REXX, but notinteractively from the Query Manager.andP;  However, a program can mix remoteprocedures with calls to the Query Manager Callable Interface.andM;Performance when accessing remote databases is fairly good.andP;  The firstconnection to a remote database takes as long as 10 seconds, compared withabout two seconds for a local database.andP;  Once the APPC link is established,subsequent connections are completed in about four seconds.andM;Generally, Database Manager's performance depends less on the location of thedata than on the processing load at the workstation--namely, how muc RAM ithas and how many other processes are running.andM;And in all cases, the longest perceptible delays occur during routineinitializations, such as establishing communications, opening tables andfinding saved queries.andP;  As soon as the overhead is out of the way, the actualdata retrieval is very fast.andM;Avoid Delays--Order Manuals EarlyandM;One of the advantages that IBM touts for its OS/2 Extended Edition is theavailability, in a single package, of the major software components requiredfor a corporate network workstation: operating system, communicationsprotocols, LAN requestor and database-management system.andM;That may be true for the software, but a product of this complexity can't beinstalled and configured without the proper documentation.andP;  And the packageis very light on documentation.andM;The manuals supplied with the system list all of the setup and supportdocuments that are needed.andP;  However, these are not books that you can pick upat your local ComputerLand, so you may encounter a delay while waiting forthe necessary special order to be filled by IBM.andM;PC Week waited weeks before finally receiving the manuals that it needed toadequately test the Database Manager.andM;To get a head start, consider placing your order for the following manualssome time prior to your purchase of the software.andM;For administrators and support personnel: Advanced Problem Determination forCommunications (Order No.andP;  01F0259), System Administrator's Guide forCommunications (01F0261) and Database Manager Administrator's Guide(01F0267).andM;For applications developers: APPC Programming Reference (01F0263), DatabaseManager SQL Reference (01F0265), Database Manager Programming Guide andReference (01F0269), and OS/2 v1.2 Tools andamp; Information (6280211), which alsoincludes software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
