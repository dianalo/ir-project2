The calculation includes Mottscattering cross sections for elastic scattering, experimental and calculatedelectron inelastic mean free paths, the Streitwolf excitation functionfor production of secondary electrons, a simple cascade for transportof secondaries, and a surface refraction condition for emission. Thespatial distribution of emitted secondary electrons was observed to bedirectly related to that of backscattered electrons in peripheral areas.The role of low-energy electron emission in the efficiency and resolutionof direct write electron beam processes is discussed and results of thecalculation are presented.</TEXT></DOC>
