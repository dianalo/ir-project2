It said 21 computer makers areconsidering building pen-based computers running on anadaptation of Microsoft's best-selling Windows operatingsystem.   Microsoft is competing with tiny Go, of Foster City,Calif., for dominance of the operating system for pen-basedmachines. These are essentially computers that recognize someform of handwriting entered by pen or stylus, or that allowthe use of a pen or stylus as a control device, roughlyanalagous to the &quot;mouse&quot; used in Windows and the Macintoshoperating system.</LP><TEXT>   Some computer experts believe the convenience and&quot;naturalness&quot; of using a pen device will open up vast newmarkets for computer makers, especially among new users ofnotebook machines or other small portables.   Both Go's Penpoint operating system and Microsoft's PenWindows use a stylus to control the basic operations of thecomputer and to enter text or numbers in crisp, clearhandwriting.   &quot;In terms of market size, most industry pundits suggestthat this has the same growth potential in the next 10 yearsas that of portables and laptops several years ago,&quot; saysJerry Kaplan, Go's chairman and co-founder. He predicted thatthe first pen-based computers will be priced as high-endportables, from $3,000 to $5,000.   Though midget-sized compared with Microsoft, Go hassecured at least the partial allegiance of InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. Last year, IBM announced plans tomake electronic &quot;notepads&quot; based on Go's Penpoint operatingsystem. Grid Systems Corp. and NCR Corp. also have plans touse Penpoint. The two leading American personal-computermanufacturers other than IBM -- Compaq Corp. and AppleComputer Inc. -- haven't yet selected an operating system forpen-based machines and haven't ruled out Go.   Microsoft said Pen Windows also has been selected fordevelopment work by Grid and NCR, and perhaps moreimportantly, by 11 big Japanese makers, including NEC Corp.,Hitachi Ltd., Fujitsu Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. Japanese makersare expected to be formidable competitors in the productionof very small pen-based portables. Computer industryofficials say Go also is negotiating with many of the sameJapanese concerns for their support.   Microsoft's list of supporters was announced following aMicrosoft-sponsored conference in Seattle of hardware andsoftware companies developing pen-based machines or programs.Microsoft said it distributed copies of a Pen Windowssoftware development kit for extensive testing by itscustomers. A final version of the kit and several PenWindows-based computers are expected by year-end, Microsoftsaid. The industry also expects Penpoint-based machines byyear-end.</TEXT></DOC>
