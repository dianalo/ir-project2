Washington-based MCI said it achieved the strong results througha combination of cost controls, new service offerings, a good salesand service organization and the increasing sophistication of itscomputerized network.   MCI spent $6 billion over eight years to build its long-distancenetwork, and the huge investment is beginning to pay off byattracting customers, said Daniel Akerson, the chief financialofficer.   ``We think it was a great quarter and an unbelievable year,''Akerson said in an interview.   MCI, invading the big-business strongholds of market leaderAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., said it won contracts over thepast year with Chrysler Corp., Cray Research Inc., Procter andamp; Gamble,the Social Security Administration, Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. and others.   Reflecting the importance of big-business accounts, 1 percent ofMCI's and ATandamp;T's customers account for roughly half of their volumeof business, Akerson estimated.   In contrast to MCI, the No.3 long-distance company, US SprintCommunications Co., has continued to lose money. But US Sprint hastrimmed its losses lately and is continuing to increase its volumeof business.   ATandamp;T makes steady profits from long-distance, but it recorded thefirst annual loss in its history last year because of a one-timecharge to cover the expense of speeding up its conversion to adigital network to meet the competition from MCI and US Sprint.   MCI said it earned $122 million, or 46 cents a share, compared to$23 million, or 8 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to$1.43 billion from $1.04 billion.   For all of 1988, MCI said its earnings shot up to $346 million,or $1.23 a share, from $64 million, or 22 cents a share, a yearearlier. Revenue jumped 69 percent to $5.14 billion from $3.94billion.   Charges for early repayment of debt reduced the latest quarter'searnings by $10 million and the year-earlier quarter's earnings by$14 million, MCI said. Offsetting those charges, the companyrecorded pre-tax gains of $12 million in the latest quarter and $19million in the year-earlier quarter from previously negotiatedantitrust settlements.</TEXT></DOC>
