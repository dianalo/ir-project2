Irradiation-induced transformation of austenite to ferriteand occasionally martensite was observed. The extent of transformationwas increased by Si and Ti additions but reduced by cold working. Voidswelling was generally reduced by Si additions, but Ti-modification resultedin enhanced swelling in solution treated alloys at high temperatures.</TEXT></DOC>
