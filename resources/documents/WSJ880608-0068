Walter Thompson Co. won more than $50 million in Bell Atlantic Corp. advertising assignments, a major coup for an agency that until recently was roiled by client and employee defections.    The account is by far the largest Thompson has won since 1986, a spokeswoman said. Last year, Thompson's poor earnings sparked an unsuccessful coup attempt by a senior officer, and culminated with an unwanted takeover by WPP Group PLC. The agency lost well over $400 million in billings, which was only partly made up for with gains; losses included its second-largest account, Pillsbury Co.'s $200 million Burger King Corp. billings.    But Thompson executives have said recently that the agency, which has been attempting to stabilize itself, is now poised to aggressively begin seeking new business again. It recently realigned its top management, and executives say winning new business will be a priority over the next year.    Bell Atlantic assignments include corporate, product line and international advertising. Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic is the parent company of New Jersey Bell, Bell of Pennsylvania, and several other phone and communications companies.    Christopher E. Clouser, Bell Atlantic's vice president for corporate relations and advertising, said the company selected Thompson because of its strong international operations and its creative reputation.    Thompson was among about six agencies asked to bid on the business, the communications company said. Most of the assignments awarded it had been handled by Ketchum Communications Inc. Bell Atlantic's Yellow Pages accounts remain at Lewis, Gilman andamp; Rynett, Philadelphia, and Poppe Tyson Inc., a unit of Bozell Inc. Its mobile systems account remains at W.B. Doner, Baltimore. </TEXT></DOC>
