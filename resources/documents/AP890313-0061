It was the second day in a row that Israeli troops had clashedwith guerrillas in Israel's self-proclaimed security zone that wereheaded for attacks in northern Israel.   The Israeli army showed reporters the bodies of three slainguerrillas at a base in northern Israel, displaying identificationpapers showing the dead men belonged to a Syrian-based PLO factionand saying they intended to attack an Israeli settlement.   The faction, the Palestine Liberation Front, said in a statementthat the guerrillas were headed into Israel for a raid.   The Israeli military said the three were killed in a half-hourfight after a predawn chase of several hours through the hills. ALebanese police spokesman said four guerrillas were killed.   The discrepancy could not immediately be resolved.   The police spokesman, who cannot be identified under standingrules, said the guerrillas were intercepted in Israel's securityzone at the village of Meiss el-Jebel shortly after midnight.   He said the Israelis fired about 600 parachute flares during theaction.   In its communique, the Israeli military said air force planesdropped the flares to light the way for the troops after theyspotted the guerrillas near Meiss el-Jebel, about half a mile fromthe Israeli border.   A soldier in the force, identified only as Ofer under armyregulations, told reporters at the base in northern Israel that hissergeant opened fire on the guerrillas after spotting their hidingplace about 20 yards away and the guerrillas fired back.   Then, he said, ``the whole force joined in and threw handgrenades. One of the terrorists opened fire and missed, and then hewas killed.''   The names on the guerrillas' documents were Ahmed MohammedAtallah, Mazen Mohammed Shams Adin, and Khaled Mohammed Ibrahim.   Also displayed to reporters were leaflets carried by the men,which said their mission was ``to identify with the children of thestones,'' referring to the Palestinian uprising in Israeli-occupiedterritories.   The guerrillas carried AK-47 automatic rifles with severalmagazines, hand grenades, three small missiles, barbed wire cutters,and photographs of members of their faction killed in earlier raidattempts.   Today's was the fourth clash between PLO guerrillas and Israelisoldiers in less than three weeks. On Sunday, Israeli soldierskilled two Palestinian guerrillas who entered the security zone.   At least 12 guerrillas have been killed in the clashes and noIsraelis were injured.   Israel has cited the clashes in asking the United States to calloff its dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Itmaintains they prove that PLO chairman Yasser Arafat is violatinghis renunciation of terrorism.   Maj. Gen. Yossi Peled, the head of northern command, told Israelradio today: ``We are talking about intensive activity by all theterrorist organizations. What happened last night is another stage.The aims of these organizations hasn't changed. They want to hurtIsraeli settlements.''   Washington ended a 13-year ban on dealings with the PLO andinitiated a dialogue with the PLO in December after Arafat renouncedterrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist.   Arafat and his aides have said attacks against Israeli militarytargets are not included in the PLO's definition of terrorism.   An Israeli Foreign Ministry official said today's attempted raidindicated Arafat could not force his entire organization to stick tohis renunciation of terrorism.   ``It's just one more indication that the PLO doesn't control allthe groups,'' said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The PLO serves as an umbrella group for eight guerrilla factionswhich sometimes fight among themselves and launch independentattacks on Israeli targets. The largest group is Arafat's mainstreamFatah.   Israel established security zone up to 10 miles deep in southLebanon to protect its northern border when it pulled most of itsforces out of the region in 1985, ending a three-year occupation.</TEXT></DOC>
