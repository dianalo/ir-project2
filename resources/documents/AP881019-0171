Following policy guidelines set down by Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz, officials in Washington and at the U.S. Embassyin Santiago refused to allow the 12-year-old F-5 jets to betransferred from Chile to Iran, State Department spokesman CharlesE. Redman said.   The Chilean government, which had bought the planes from theUnited States in 1976, was ``up-front'' and the Israelis actedquickly to stop an Israeli arms merchant from participating in thescheme, Redman said.   According to ABC-TV, which broke the story Tuesday night,Iranians with the approval of parliamentary Speaker HashemiRafsanjani, authorized Raymond Molina, a Cuban-American, to tellthe U.S. government four hostages would be freed if the deal wentthrough.   Redman said the hostages were introduced only in the finalstages of a proposal that was rejected under the U.S. policy knownas ``Operation Staunch.'' It seeks to persuade other governmentsand private arms dealers not to provide weapons to Iran.   Two years ago, President Reagan's secret approval of U.S.missile sales to Tehran _ despite the policy _ set offcongressional and criminal investigations. The idea was toencourage moderation in Tehran and also bring about the release ofAmerican hostages.   Nine Americans are being held in Lebanon, according to U.S.counterterrorism experts, by groups under Iran's influence.   ABC said the complicated scheme began last December as Iran,desperate for weapons to use in its war with Iraq, approached theChilean government, using a group of arms dealers from Argentina,Israel and Britain, along with several Iranians living in Europe.   The deal, which in its original form would have bypassed theU.S. government, contemplated sending the F-5 jets in pieces byship officially to Thailand but in reality to Iran for $170million, ABC said.   But after an Iranian team got to Santiago, officers in theChilean Air Force ``got cold feet'' and insisted the sale requiredU.S. approval, correspondent John McWethy reported.   Under U.S. law, while the planes belonged to Chile they couldnot be transferred to another country without U.S. consent.   The ABC story said this led to an attempt to obtain the secretapproval of the U.S. government with the assistance of Molina, aCuban-American in Key Biscayne, Fla., who had taken part in thefutile U.S.-backed attempt to invade Cuba in 1961.   To convince the arms dealers that he had useful connections withthe administration, ABC said, Molina sent them signed pictures ofhimself with both Reagan and Vice President George Bush.   However, there is no evidence that Molina, a big contributor toRepublican campaigns, had any contact with the White House or withBush's campaign for the presidency, ABC said.   In New York, Iranian U.N. Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati,said ``We categorically deny the news reported by ABC yesterday. Itend to believe such sensationalism arises out of the atmosphere ofthe American presidential elections. ... Such deals have not beenattempted or sanctioned. The idea of exchanging hostages forweapons is a bitter and reprehensible idea.''   According to ABC, Harry G. Barnes, the U.S. ambassador to Chile,got wind of the complicated scheme and alerted the State Department.   Redman said Shultz was not involved directly in blocking thedeal. The spokesman said lower-level officials at the departmentand in the embassy in Santiago applied his policy.   ``We're not going to be a party, or arrange in any way, for armsto be transferred to Iran,'' the spokesman said. ``The hostageelement seems to have come up only briefly and very fleetingly inthe last stages, and it seems to have been raised by the brokers,not by the Iranians.''   Redman added: ``And as you can imagine, again, when that issuewas raised, the answer was just as clear: No deals.''   ABC said the deal never got off the ground despite an approachby a wealthy Argetine to the U.S. Embassy in Buenos Aires and thento Colin Powell, the U.S. national security adviser.   The CIA neither endorsed nor rejected the proposal, while Powellapparently never replied, ABC said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, talking to reportersaboard Air Force One during a presidential campaign tour of Ohio,said Powell had not been contacted by anyone about the deal.   Otherwise, Fitzwater said, the ABC report was essentiallycorrect and was ``an example of private individuals trying to getinto the hostage situation for private gain.''   ``It is not helping the hostages, it is not helping ourrelations in the Middle East and it is very detrimental to ourforeign policy,'' the spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
