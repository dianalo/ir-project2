Contenders for the 19th largest U.S. company had until 5 p.m. ESTFriday to submit proposals to a special committee of RJR Nabiscodirectors on how much they were willing to pay and how they intendedto raise the purchase money.   RJR spokeswoman Polly Howe said the committee intended to remainsilent about the bidding process indefinitely. ``They are notdiscussing or disclosing or confirming. There is no commentregarding the proposals,'' she said.   Sources familiar with process confirmed that the two main biddersfor the company submitted proposals by the deadline but detailsabout them weren't disclosed. It also remained unclear whether anyother bids were delivered.   Wall Street speculators, who had battered the RJR stock down to$82.75 a share earlier in the week after being spooked by rumors ofwithdrawn bids, ran it back up to $84 in heavy trading Friday.   ``People had gotten a little anxious,'' said Marc I. Cohen, asecurities analyst who follows RJR Nabisco for the investment firmSanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. in New York. ``It was overdone.''   Though details of any winning offer were not expected to bedisclosed until Sunday afternoon at the earliest, most analystsreckoned it would put at least a $91-a-share value on the company's225.3 million shares, or about $20.5 billion.   Before the Friday deadline, two known contenders were vying forthe company in a takeover battle that has dwarfed all previousrecords in size and complexity.   One is a group consisting of RJR Nabisco's top managers and theinvestment firms Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Salomon BrothersInc. The managers incited the battle by disclosing last month theywere considering buying up all outstanding RJR Nabisco shares withborrowed money, the takeover tactic commonly known as a leveragedbuyout.   The other bidding group is headed by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co., undisputed leader in leveraged buyouts. The Kohlberg factionalso includes the powerful investment firms of Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc., Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Wasserstein Perella andamp; Co. andMerrill Lynch andamp; Co.   In the early stages of the fight both groups offered more than$20 billion for RJR Nabisco, the Atlanta-based maker of hundreds ofitems that range from Jose Cuervo tequila to Salem cigarettes andLife Savers candy to Milk Bone doggie snacks.   Lawyers and investment advisers for RJR Nabisco's specialdirectors committee were expected to hole up in their New Yorkoffices analyzing the bids at least through Sunday morning. Thefive-member committee was then expected to consider which bid toaccept.</TEXT></DOC>
