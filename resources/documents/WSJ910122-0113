The products have been delayed for two years, and thebillion-dollar development costs associated with them havecontributed to the poor performance of Kodak'sinformation-systems division. How well the products performwill help determine whether Kodak can become a much biggerplayer in the copier industry.</LP><TEXT>   Industry observers who have seen the copiers and printersay the products have innovative features. Even withoutthese, they said, they should find a niche in the market bybeing aggressively priced.   The product that has raised the greatest expectations is adigital copier called the 1500 Series, which uses a scannerinstead of traditional optical copier technology. Byconverting the document into computer bits, the copierprovides a range of finishing capabilities, includingstapling, booklet making, saddle stitching, inserting andfolding.   The copier prints 70 pages a minute, uses black and threeother colors, and will be priced between $34,000 and $47,000.That makes it a low-end competitor to Xerox Corp.'s recentlyintroduced DocuTech, a fast-speed, high-volume digital copierthat costs about $220,000.   Kodak's other new copier, the 2100 Series, combines110-image-per-minute optical copying with digital featuresand special color capabilities. In general, optical copiersoffer better image quality and are less expensive; digitalcopiers can do more tricks with things like colors and imagemanipulation.   For example, the 2100 Series can program automatic pagenumbering and time and date stamps onto copies. The machinewill cost between $85,000 and $95,000. Neither the 2100Series nor the 1500 copier is a full color copier. Both willbe available by midyear in the U.S., Japan, Canada andEurope.   The copier products being introduced tomorrow aren't partof a network system. However, Kodak says it has demonstratedthe 1500 series as a network printer.   Kodak will also introduce a desktop printer, called theEktaplus 7016, which can serve up to four users on McIntoshor IBM computers. The machine has two advantages. It prints16 pages a minute, whereas most competitors are in theeight-to-10 page range, and the printer also has a low-volumecopying capability, six-per-minute. The product, alreadyavailable, costs about $5,500.   Kodak introduced a LionHeart printer last September, ahigh-end, high-volume printer compared to the 7016 printer tobe introduced today. The LionHeart prints 92 pages a minute.   David Goodstein, an information-systems consultant inArlington, Mass., praised the products but said Kodak willhave a tough time making up for losses over the last twoyears due to by their delay. &quot;If they had been out there twoyears ago, they would have had the field to themselves,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Now we believe Japanese competitors will have similarproducts later this year.&quot;   Kodak is also introducing these products amid a recession,when many companies cut back capital expenditures. ButCharles L. Trowbridge, vice president of Kodak's CopyProducts division, said: &quot;We're all concerned about war andrecession, but these products don't have life cycles of sixmonths or a year. Customers will be happy with these and withfollow-on products.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
