Regan was White House chief of staff until he was forced out inearly 1987, reportedly after a feud with first lady Nancy Reagan.His book, ``For the Record,'' depicts President Reagan as a passivepresident loathe to make decisions and manipulated by a wife heldhostage to the stars.   Books like Regan's ``diminish the president's stature, and forthe rest of the Western world, so much depends on the president'sprestige,'' said Henry Brandon, longtime Washington correspondentfor the London Sunday Times and now a visiting scholar at theBrookings Institution, a liberal think tank.   With a U.S.-Soviet summit in Moscow less than a month away, oneSoviet scholar said the book _ particularly details of Mrs.Reagan's penchant for astrology _ provides fodder for the Russianpropaganda machine.   Perhaps more damaging, though, is that the revelations mayreinforce the perception Soviets have of Americans as a weird,superstitious and somewhat untrustworthy breed, said Jerry Hough, aprofessor at Duke University and the author of a just-publishedbook, ``Russia and the West: Gorbachev and the Politics of Reform.''   The stargazing passages ``confirm a picture of America that is astrange and, in many respects, a not totally rational place,''Hough said. Daily horoscopes are not a regular feature in theSoviet newspapers, as they are in many American and Europeanpublications.   Soviets have long been concerned that the United States is ``nota reliable partner'' because of Congress' failure to ratify theSALT II treaty, among other things, Hough said.   Regan's book won't make it any easier for U.S. officials toaccomplish their goals at the coming summit, he said.   On the other hand, Hough said the administration has loweredexpectations about the summit to such a degree that Regan's bookcould have little impact.   Several people said Regan's often scornful picture of what goeson behind the gates at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue comes too late inthe Reagan presidency to do any real harm to his administration orto the United States.   Many foreign governments are biding their time until the nextpresident takes office anyway, they say.   The Soviet Embassy was closed Monday to celebrate the World WarII victory over Germany, but Valentin Falin, the chairman ofNovisti, the government-controlled press agency, made that point ina recent interview.   The U.S. government is virtually crippled with indecision duringan election year because no one knows what the future holds, hesaid.   Helms disagreed. ``There is no reason why he can't make foreignpolicy decisions,'' he said.   Put in context, Regan's book is not nearly as serious for U.S.foreign policy as, for instance, the Iran-Contra affair in whichweapons were secretly sold to Iran with profits diverted to theNicaraguan rebels, said Brandon.   Diplomats at several embassies declined to be quoted by name intalking about the Regan flap for fear of offending the UnitedStates. A few chuckled, but none considered the damage to the U.S.image to be too serious.   ``George Shultz might joke about it on the golf course with BobHawke,'' said an Australian, referring to the secretary of stateand the Australian prime minister, respectively. ``It makes youlook a bit silly,'' he said.   Herman Nickel, the former U.S. ambassador to South Africa in theReagan administration, said books like Regan's are ``not helpful ina general sense'' to Americans trying to carry out theadministration's policies abroad.   At the same time, he said foreigners understand that ``peoplewith a grudge tend to tell their stories.''   While diplomats were cautious, foreign reporters had a heydaywith the story.   ``People abroad think this is just another giggle,'' said ElgyGillespie, who writes for the Irish Times in Dublin. ``It's justone more hilarious thing about the Reagans, isn't it?''   Europeans have often mocked the Reagans for their Californiatastes and their ``glizerati friends at the White House,'' shesaid. ``What are we going to do for kicks if kiss-and-tell booksare ever barred?''</TEXT></DOC>
