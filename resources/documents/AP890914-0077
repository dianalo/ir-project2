Neither Sears, Roebuck and Co. nor Canadian developer Olympia andamp;York Developments Ltd. would say Wednesday whether the deal wasdead, but its condition was clearly critical.   The Chicago Tribune today quoted sources as saying Sears had seta Friday deadline for any deal with Olympia andamp; York. Sears isprepared to meet with other parties next week if there is noagreement, the paper said.   The roadblock, sources said, is a dispute over which party shouldpay the increased property taxes stemming from an expectedre-appraisal of the 110-story, 1,707-foot building after the sale.   ``There is a major impasse over the tax situation,'' said KevinHaggarty, an executive vice president of Cushman andamp; Wakefield, a NewYork real estate firm that was advising Olympia andamp; York. ``It's aserious situation.''   The Wall Street Journal quoted unidentified sources Tuesday assaying the parties were prepared to sign an agreement Tuesday forabout $1 billion when the reappraisal issue arose.   Haggarty said he could not confirm those details.   Olympia andamp; York confirmed the talks were stalled but would notelaborate.   Sears spokesman Douglas Fairweather declined to comment.   Another sticking point, sources told The Associated Press, wasthe difficulty of finding tenants for the 2 million square feet ofoffice space that Sears will vacate in the 3.7-million-square-footbuilding when it moves its retailing division to a new complex insuburban Hoffman Estates beginning in 1992.   Olympia andamp; York reportedly considered signing British publisherMaxwell Communications Corp. as its anchor tenant. But Maxwell hasbeen eyeing sites in the suburbs, according to a source whodescribed office space in the 15-year-old tower as ``incrediblyobsolete.''   Maxwell spokesman David Adler declined comment on the company'splans.   Sears had agreed to continue paying rent for six years on thespace it plans to vacate but was unwilling to shoulder any increasedtaxes, according to the Journal.   The nation's biggest retailer announced last October it wouldsell the Chicago landmark as part of a corporate restructuring. Itreportedly began serious talks with Olympia andamp; York earlier thissummer.   At least three other parties reportedly bid for the building,although Olympia andamp; York has been the only one to confirm itsinterest.</TEXT></DOC>
