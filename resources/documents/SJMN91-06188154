My mother was a ward committeewoman in Chicago.Yes, she worked for a person named Richard J. Daley. The discussion was aboutchildren not being able to get a good education.;    My mother, uncles, auntsand some people from down the block were getting pretty loud 'bout this.Probably not important, since they were always gettin' worked up 'boutsomethin'. Old folks, always a shoutin' 'bout nothin' and then a tellin' uskids to be quiet. Seems they were gettin' pretty headed 'bout &quot;education ofthe race&quot; was the only way to break the &quot;race barrier.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  EVEN SO, THE DREAM LIVES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Others were concerned that they might anger some white folks and that wouldcause big problems. None of this made any sense to me.;    I remember Mamataking me to the old exposition hall where this man was a talking about theneeds to address something called &quot;separate schoolin' &quot; and that &quot;Negroes&quot; hadto take some stand and that some Negroes were already hurting.;    I wonderedwhy they didn't just take them to the hospital. This man and one or two otherswanted money. Sounded like some of those preachers with the sharp clothes andbig cars to me. The grown-ups were just fussin' again. Seems like they was aalways a fussin' 'bout something 'n' a keepin' us kids from being able to goout and play. None of this made any sense to me. There were many discussionsabout being able to get a job if the race was properly educated. Wellapparently, that man went away somewhere and this kid never saw him again.;   However, I saw him many times. I even went to his school. Actually only methim once in person, but I saw him twice at work. However, it appears that hewas never able to finish the job. I guess someone else or a lot of someoneelses will have to finish the job for him.;    You see, he's finally retiring.Some people are very happy about his retirement. I'm not.;    I now understandwhat the old folks were a fussin' and a shoutin' 'bout. I also understand thatwithout this man's insight, talents, abilities and attitude toward takingpersonal risks, for the benefit of others, someone other than myself would besitting in this chair that I am sitting in while I write this letter. Yes,today's a sad day and the days ahead will be harder days.;    Indeed, I amvery proud to have gone to his school, to have lived in his lifetime andbenefited from his many good deeds. There will be many stories that I willtell my grandchildren, but none more important or impressive than about theman whose school I was able to attend.;    Thurgood, I wish you only the verybest in whatever time you have remaining and may God continue to bless you andkeep you from harm's way. I also wish to assure you that no matter howdifficult, no matter how far, the torch shall be borne. For the dream cannotdie, it can only be postponed for a moment.;    -- Daniel B.
