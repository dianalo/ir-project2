Think of it -- one of our braveNational Guardsmen may have actually been safer in the midstof the largest armored offensive in history than he wouldhave been on the streets of his own hometown.&quot; President Bushmade this sobering observation at an anti-crime conferencethis week at the Justice Department. He made a furtherconnection. &quot;The kind of moral force and national will thatfreed Kuwait City from abuse can free America's cities fromcrime,&quot; he said. &quot;Among the lessons is that in furtherance ofa widely accepted moral value, collective action succeeds.&quot;   In his address this week to the joint session, Mr. Bushchallenged Washington to collectively apply these lessonslearned fighting a criminal tyrant abroad to the battleagainst criminals at home. He gave Congress 100 days to passhis anti-crime bill, which would start to return to thepolice and courts the powers they need to make the streetssafe. The bill, which goes to Congress next week, is similarto one legislators rejected last year.</LP><TEXT>   The bill would make important changes in the exclusionaryrule, which since Miranda and related Supreme Court cases hashindered law enforcement by suppressing evidence from juries.One proposal would allow evidence from searches by policeofficers who acted in good faith, even if the search warrantturns out to have technical problems.   Some in the administration are also considering a morefar-reaching proposal to abolish the exclusionary rule. Theidea would be to allow the evidence into court, but alsocreate a new system to directly discipline policemisbehavior. This would be a big improvement on theexclusionary rule's absurdity of banning evidence, lettingcriminals go free and leaving police officers undisciplinedfor any errors.   Other provisions would try to limit the endless appeals ofdeath-penalty convictions, which since the return of thedeath penalty in 1973 have made the average delay fromconviction to execution more than eight years. Manyprisoners, even those who confessed to murder, get endlessappeals in state and federal courts. Last year, Congresssandbagged the Bush crime bill when the House insertedprovisions that would have invalidated the death penalties ofthe more than 2,300 people on death row by declaring thepenalty inherently racist. This despite the fact that blacksand other minorities are disproportionately the victims ofcapital and other serious offenses.   Supreme Court Justice Sandra O'Connor gave an importantspeech at the Justice Department crime conference titled,&quot;Local Control of Crime.&quot; She noted that under ourcriminal-justice system, 96% of felony convictions are instate courts, but that increasingly convicts are making&quot;habeas corpus&quot; appeals to the federal courts, arguing thatthey were unfairly convicted. Many of these appeals are indeath-penalty cases.   While the federal courts need to ensure that state trialsare &quot;fundamentally fair,&quot; Justice O'Connor also warned, &quot;Thedelay and uncertainty that federal relitigation bringsfrustrates the states' ability to enforce their criminal lawsand to control anti-social behavior.&quot; She stressed that&quot;certainty and immediacy of punishment are the most importantelements of effective deterrence.&quot;   Last year, six million Americans were the victims ofviolent crime, more than the number injured in autoaccidents. One reason for record levels of crime is preciselythat despite all the filled jail cells, certainty andimmediacy of punishment have become a joke. Fewer than onearrest in 100 in New York City leads to anyone spending asingle day in jail. One reason is that after Miranda, thepercentage of people arrested for felonies who confess fellto 40% from 90%. We have turned law enforcement into a sillydetective game that the detectives too often lose.   It is now clear that the Vietnam Syndrome extended toself-doubts about the moral authority to enforce rules ofbehavior at home. Volumes of rules now on the books have theexpress purpose of limiting the ability of the police to dotheir job. Indeed, Miranda is the domestic equivalent of theWar Powers Resolution. Just as Presidents were no longersupposed to have the power to lead the country into war, lawenforcement was no longer considered worthy of the toolsrequired to punish wrongdoers at home.   The new self-confidence from the victory in the PersianGulf includes a recognition that we can take care of seriousproblems if we have the resolve to get the job done. It's upto Congress to decide if this time it's going to stand withMr. Bush or continue to let crime take its toll.</TEXT></DOC>
