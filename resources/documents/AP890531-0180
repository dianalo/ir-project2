Soldiers shot a Palestinian to death in the occupied Gaza Stripand two others died of wounds suffered earlier, raising to 503 thenumber of Palestinians killed since an uprising began in theoccupied lands nearly 18 months ago. Twenty-two Israelis have beenslain.   Ten Palestinians were reported wounded in the Gaza Strip and twoin the occupied West Bank.   Police detained six Jewish settlers suspected of killing a13-year-old girl and wounding two other Palestinians in a raidMonday on Kifil Harith village in the West Bank. They wereidentified as students at the Joseph's Tomb Yeshiva in Nablus, 12miles away.   In Israel, a 4-year-old Arab boy was killed when he stepped on amine near the border with Syria on the Golan Heights, police said.   Ehud Olmert, Cabinet minister for Arab affairs, said a newpolicy in Ariel, a Jewish settlement in the West Bank, thatrequires Arab workers to wear tags saying ``alien worker'' was``insensitive, unintelligent and immoral.''   The policy, announced Tuesday, inspired comparison with theNazis forcing Jews to wear yellow stars of David. Ron Nachman,mayor of Ariel, said all workers would wear the tags, not justArabs.   A military spokesman said the border skirmish Wednesday occurrednear Hula, a Lebanese village about a mile from the Israeli town ofKiryat Shmona, a military spokesman said.   It was the third encounter in four days in the ``security zone''Israel maintains just north of the border. Sources in theIsraeli-sponsored South Lebanon Army militia, which helps patrolthe zone, said the guerrillas were trying to attack a militiaposition.   The two clashes Sunday and Tuesday, described as infiltrationattempts, broke a lull of more than two months in guerrilla effortsto enter Israel. A total of three guerrillas were killed.   An army spokesman said troopers spotted the guerrillasWednesday, opened fire and killed them immediately. The spokesman,who cannot be identified under army regulations, said there were noIsraeli casualties.   Reporters in Kiryat Shmona were shown the bodies of theguerrillas, in white plastic bags, and four AK-47 assault riflesarmy officials said the men carried.   On Wednesday evening, the army command said, Israeli jets raided``two terrorist targets'' near Sidon and in the Bekaa Valley. Itdescribed the targets as ``headquarters and ammunition dumps ofHezbollah and Abu Nidal'' that were ``point of planning'' for theinfiltrations.   Hezbollah is a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem militia, and the AbuNidal group is a non-PLO guerrilla faction supported by Syria andLibya.   Lebanese police said four jets made the raid on Palestinianbases east of Sidon at about 7 p.m., and six struck Hezbollah basesin the Bekaa about 15 minutes later.   At least five guerrillas were missing and presumed dead from theattack on the Palestinian forces and nine guerrillas were wounded,the Lebanese police reported. They gave no casualties for theattack on Hezbollah targets.   Arab doctors identified the Palestinian killed Wednesday in theGaza Strip as 20-year-old Ahmed Abdul Rahman Abu Habab and said hewas shot in the chest in Khan Yunis. They said five Palestinianswere wounded.   The two Palestinians who died of wounds suffered earlier wereidentified in Arab news reports as Ahmed Ibrahim Nawas, 18, shotTuesday, and Mohammed Ali Farajani, 15, wounded May 14.   Palestinians throughout the occupied lands observed a generalstrike Wednesday that was ordered by Moslem fundamentalists toprotest what they called Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's ``curseagainst the prophet Mohammed.''   The strike referred to a newspaper interview in which Shamirsaid Israel must not make territorial concessions to thePalestinians because they ``might say, `Let's cheat the Israelisjust like Mohammed did.'''   Palestinians ``always bring these examples of how Mohammed usedall sorts of ruses to overcome his opponents,'' Shamir told theJerusalem Post in the interview published earlier this month.</TEXT></DOC>
