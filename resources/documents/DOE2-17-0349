<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0349 </DOCNO><TEXT>EPRI has developed a software package for use in (1) analyzing nondestructivethickness measurements of fossil-fired boiler tubes; (2) planning boilertube thickness inspections; and (3) documenting tube failures causedby a variety of mechanisms. When used as a tool for examination planningand data analysis, the software has the potential for reducing examinationand maintenance costs, improving plant availability, and reducing concernsrelated to plant safety. The software package was released for utilityevaluation in 1986. Since the release, the users have provided feedbackto EPRI on their experiences with the programs and on needed improvements.This paper describes the utility experience with the boiler inspectionsoftware and makes recommendations for future development of computerprograms for inspection and maintenance planning.</TEXT></DOC>
