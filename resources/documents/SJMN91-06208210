But in a Latino context, for goodness' sake, it's clearas glass that Anglo means those not of la raza.;    As for the other, well, Ispent most of my childhood in the South, and &quot;redneck,&quot; my dears, is asite-specific term for people like the inhabitants of Tuna, Texas. It doesn'tmean, as the task force reads it, a denigrating term for all EuropeanAmericans. Lighten up, Eurofolks.;    (box) A reader called to correct myFrench in a review of &quot;The First Part of Henry VI&quot; at the Oregon ShakespeareFestival. Joan la Pucelle, which is Shakespeare's name for Joan of Arc, doesnot mean &quot;Joan the Whore,&quot; she said, it means &quot;Joan the Maid.&quot;;    Yes and no.Technically, true. But the French, as well as the English, used it derisivelyto mean &quot;the unbedded one&quot; -- because until the turning of the Siege ofOrleans, they thought the girl from Domremy had gained control of the army bysleeping with the Dauphin.;    After she began to win battles, they used &quot;lapucelle&quot; with affection.;    In Elizabethan England, where &quot;pussel&quot; was acommon term for a whore, Shakespeare made of her nickname a Franco-Englishpun.;    (box) Another caller insists he is real, not synthetic. It seemsthere is a pit chorus, more correctly an offstage chorus, in TheatreWorks'dazzling production of &quot;Miami Lights.&quot; (I had thought a voice synthesizerprovided the vocal accompaniment.) Most of the choristers are singer-dancersin the cast, but the two who are never seen or credited in the program areEric Ribeira and Don Paterson.;    EXTENSIONS -- &quot;The Kathy andamp; Mo Show&quot; isrunning well enough to hold its ground at Theater on the Square throughAugust. . . . And Z Collective's feminist satire on Shakespeare, &quot;Goodnight,Desdemona (Good Morning, Juliet),&quot; has been extended through Aug. 5 at NewCollege of California, San Francisco. (Not a misprint: Z performs Mondays.);   DE MORTUIS -- William Wesley Peters, who died July 17 at the age of 79, wasthe architect of record for San Jose's Center for the Performing Arts, whichopened in 1972, closed three months later when the ceiling caved in andreopened in 1974.;    The CPA is currently used by the San Jose Symphony, SanJose Civic Light Opera and San Jose Cleveland Ballet (which put $1.2 millioninto stage renovations, most of it donated by board member Steve Wozniak, in1988).;    Perhaps Peters, a disciple and son-in-law of Frank Lloyd Wright,has gone to spend eternity in a concert hall that looks and sounds nothinglike the CPA, with (what a concept!) accessible restrooms.;    In the oldendays, cities used to build multipurpose arts centers to save money. Now evenSan Jose's city parents are becoming aware that, in the long run, theaterstailored to their users are a better investment.;    IT NEVER RAINS DEPT. --As the New Vic Theatre of London continues to lay 'em in the aisles ofBerkeley's Julia Morgan Theater with its irreverent &quot;Hunchback of Notre Dame,&quot;another group called The People Show arrives this week from England to playthe On Broadway Theater, on Broadway, San Francisco. The play, called&quot;Farrago,&quot; is a cabaret setting of another light-hearted classic, &quot;Faust,&quot; byMr. Goethe.
