A dynamic ventricular phantomis explained that has been developed for checking and calibration forsafe examination of patient, the phantom allowing extensive simulationof volumetric and hemodynamic conditions of the human heart: One sectiondiscusses the program development for image processing, referring toa number of different computer systems. The equipment described includesa small non-expensive PC system, as well as a standardized nuclear medicaldiagnostic system, and a computer system especially suited to image processing.</TEXT></DOC>
