(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury considering the bribery caseagainst three California executives charged in the Pentagoncorruption case resumed deliberations today after failing to reacha verdict in two days.   The four women and eight men informed U.S. District JudgeRichard Williams late Tuesday that they had not come to a decisionafter a total of 20 hours of deliberations.   Williams said he would give the jury new instructions today ifthey were having problems with the charges.   Dale Schnittjer, Eugene Sullivan and George Kaub, three formervice presidents of Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif.,are charged with bribery, conspiracy and wire fraud in the firstcase brought to trial since the government ``Ill Wind''investigation into fraud and kickbacks at the Pentagon began nearlythree years ago.   Kaub is also charged with two counts of filing false statements.   The case involves what prosecutors say was a conspiracy to bribea Navy official for information about a $24 million contract thatTeledyne obtained in July 1987 to build hand-held radar test sets.   The government claims the defendants knew that William Parkin, aprivate consultant hired by Teledyne Electronics, was paying bribesto Stuart Berlin, the Navy official.   Both Parkin and Berlin, as well as Teledyne Industries, theparent of Teledyne Electronics, have pleaded guilty in the case andare cooperating with government.   But the defendants said they didn't know Parkin had doneanything illegal.   Kaub, Schnittjer and Sullivan testified Parkin was hired for$10,000 for his expertise in November 1985.   He was promised $150,000 if Teledyne won the radar contract,which it did. Parkin was paid about $18,000 before the paymentsstopped when the Ill Wind case was made public.</TEXT></DOC>
