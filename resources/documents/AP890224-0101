The nation's central bank is trying to slow down the economy andcrush inflation by draining reserves from the banking system. Thathas boosted short-term interest rates, although long-term rates haverisen relatively little.   The Federal Reserve today raised its discount rate, which itcharges on loans to member banks, to 7 percent from 6.5 percent, itshighest level since April 1986.   Major banks already had begun raising their prime rate, abenchmark for a wide range of consumer and business loans, to 11.5percent from 11 percent, effective today. That move was made inresponse to the recent rise in short-term interest rates, whichincreases the banks' own costs of borrowing.   Chase Manhattan Bank and Republic National Bank of New Yorkannounced the increases Thursday. Chemical Bank, ManufacturersHanover Trust Co., Citibank and other major banks followed suittoday.   The increase in the prime rate is more significant to businessesand consumers because of its direct effect on loan rates such asadjustable-rate mortgages. The discount rate is relatively littleused and the latest increase only partially catches it up withincreases in other rates.   The prime is at its highest level since November 1984. In thepast year the rate has jumped 3 percentage points. The most recentrise, to 11 percent from 10.5 percent, was on Feb. 10.   Banks are passing along higher rates because their own cost offunds has risen and demand for loans remains strong, said Alan Lenz,director of trade and economics for the Chemical ManufacturersAssociation.   ``The prime rate is like any other price; it's set by both supplyand demand. They're going to get the best price they can,'' Lenzsaid.   Chase said it was reacting to rises in other rates, notanticipating them, when it raised its prime rate.   ``The prime's a laggard rate,'' said Fraser Seitel, a senior vicepresident.   On Wednesday, the Labor Department reported that consumer pricesrose in January at an annual rate of 7.2 percent, the highest in twoyears.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan called the inflationtrend disturbing and vowed to keep upward pressure on rates untilthe pinch succeeds in squeezing inflation out of the economy.   Since February 1988 the federal funds rate has jumped by morethan 3 percentage points. This rate, the interest on overnight loansbetween banks, is closely controlled by the Federal Reserve.   The Fed drained reserves from the banking system on Thursday,seemingly indicating that it wants to keep the federal funds ratesomewhere between 9.5 percent and 9.75 percent, said Giulio Martini,an economist at the investment firm Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. inNew York.   Banks typically set their prime rate about 2 percentage pointsabove the federal funds rate, which would translate to a prime of11.5 percent to 11.75 percent, Martini said.   ``This is essentially a correctly placed prime,'' Martini said.   Increases in rates have not slowed the economy much so far. Onereason is that long-term rates have not risen much because investorshave been confident of the Fed's determination to control inflation.   Long-term rates edge up when investors begin to lose confidencein the Fed and demand higher rates to compensate for expectedinflation.</TEXT></DOC>
