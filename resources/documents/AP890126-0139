(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A mother was arraigned Thursday oncharges of drugging her 9-year-old son and forcing him and his12-year-old sister into prostitution with as many as 80 adults.   Police sought the children's grandmother, a 48-year-old Concordwoman, on a warrant charging her with pandering in the same case.   Authorities believe the mother, a 29-year-old El Cerrito woman,used money collected for the sex acts to buy drugs, police Lt. RayHoward said. Neither the mother nor the grandmother were identifiedby name in order to protect the children.   A guardian whom the children live with called police last weekand reported they had been forced to prostitute themselves while thefamily lived in Richmond from 1986 to 1988, Howard said.   The children said their mother gave them marijuana, alcohol,sleeping pills, cocaine and methamphetamine in an effort todesensitize them to the sex acts, Howard said.   The boy told investigators that his mother forced him to have sexwith 20 women, and the girl said she was forced to have sex with 60men.   The mother is charged with 16 felony counts of forcing thechildren into lewd and lascivious acts, two counts of panderingchildren for sex and one count of supplying crack cocaine to her son.   The thin woman with stringy, shoulder-length hair appearednervous when appearing before Bay Municipal Court Judge AllenNorris, and said she did not have money to hire a lawyer. Norrisreferred her to the Public Defender's Office.   The judge set her next court date for Feb. 2, and ordered her toremain at the county jail in Martinez with no bail. He also sealedthe court records.   The woman has no previous criminal history, said Deputy DistrictAttorney Brandon Baum.   Baum said he has prosecuted other parents for prostituting theirchildren, but this case is different.   ``I would say it's unusual based on the business-like manner inwhich the acts took place. ... It was not a haphazard type ofthing,'' he said, adding there were no signs that the mother tookany precautions to protect the children's physical health or guardthem against sexually transmitted disease.   According to Baum, the grandmother allegedly ``aided and abettedin making arrangements for the acts to take place.'' Most occurredat the family home.   ``There are still a lot of unanswered questions about thegrandmother ... her role here,'' Howard said.   Authorities first investigated the mother in May after an allegedmolestation of the girl. There is a $25,000 warrant outstanding forthe arrest of the 33-year-old man suspected in that case.   The county's Child Protective Services took the brother andsister away from their mother because of neglect concerns and placedthem in a foster home, Howard said.   Two other girls, ages 2 and 4, were taken from the home shortlyafter the May incident, authorities said.   Officials believe the children's father was not involved in thealleged prostitution and wasn't living with them at the time, Howardsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
