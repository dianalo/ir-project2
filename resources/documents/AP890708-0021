Ford Electronics and Refrigeration Corp. of Lansdale, Pa., has 15working days to contest the fine proposed Friday by the OccupationalSafety and Health Administration.   OSHA said the company had willfully ignored a 1987 agreementbetween the agency and Ford in which the automaker settledworker-safety complaints at two other plants and agreed to acompany-wide reform of its record keeping practices relating toillnesses and injuries.   A Ford spokesman said company officials were reviewing thecitations and had no immediate comment.   The Pennsylvania subsidiary was cited for 241 willful violationsof the agreement for allegedly misrecording or failing to recordinjuries and illnesses. It also was cited for serious violations forallegedly overexposing workers to the hazards of lasers andrepetitive motion.   ``Other employers who enter into agreements with OSHA to abatejob safety and health violations and hazards should realize thatthis case shows we mean business about enforcing settlementagreements,'' Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said in announcing theproposed fine.   The action stems from OSHA inspections of the Lansdale plant thatbegan earlier this year following an employee complaint aboutexposure to asbestos, OSHA said. The agency said the plant employsabout 2,600 workers and manufactures auto parts such as cruisecontrol units and fuel injection systems.   Willful violations are defined as situations in which theemployer knew of a violation of OSHA standards or was aware that ahazardous condition existed but made no attempt to correct it.Serious violations cover alleged offenses in which the employer knewor should have known a workplace activity posed a substantialprobability of death or serious physical harm.   If Ford contests the fine, the case would be referred to anadministrative law judge, who would hold hearings on the matter. Ifeither side appeals a judge's finding, the case is referred to thequasi-judicial Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. Anyappeals from that proceeding would go to the U.S. Court of Appeals.</TEXT></DOC>
