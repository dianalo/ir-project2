A spokesman for the aerospace concern said it was &quot;remotely possible&quot; that the two aircraft each scheduled for delivery to Northwest Airlines and Singapore Airlines in December could be pushed into next January. Boeing's previous projection of 1988 revenue of around $17 billion includes the four December deliveries of 747-400s, which sell for $110 million to $129 million each.    The spokesman wouldn't comment on how a delay of a month or more might affect 1988 net income.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares closed at $46.75, down 50 cents.    Boeing's first test flight of the 747-400 had been expected late last month and &quot;is still expected this month,&quot; the spokesman said. Despite the delays, related to the installation of new digital technology &quot;on the flight deck and throughout the airplane,&quot; he said Boeing still believes Federal Aviation Administration certification of the 747-400 will be won in December and the four deliveries will be made at that time.    Boeing has taken orders for 118 of the planes, which can seat more than 500 passengers and have a range of 8,000 miles. Deliveries are scheduled through the mid-1990s. </TEXT></DOC>
