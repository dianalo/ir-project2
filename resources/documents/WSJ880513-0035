The agency voted 3-0 for a proposal that would generally cap phone-rate increases at three percentage points less than a measure of annual inflation. The FCC estimated that consumers' long-distance phone bills would be 0.5% lower annually than under traditional regulation, which oversees profit margins instead of phone rates.    FCC Chairman Dennis Patrick, in an interview, hailed the expected benefits as a &quot;substantial cut for consumers.&quot; He said it would reduce phone rates by $1.6 billion over a four-year period, compared with projected rates under the current method. But reaction on Capitol Hill was skeptical, and Brian Moir, an attorney for the International Communications Association, a trade association of large phone customers, said the FCC should require much tougher terms on phone rates.    The FCC has authority over the interstate phone business of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the regional Bell companies and other local telephone companies. But in a sharp departure from past practice, the agency plans to give these companies the choice of switching to the price-cap plan for a four-year period beginning April 1, or retaining traditional regulation.    Mr. Patrick said that having a choice would mainly benefit rural phone companies, which might consider it burdensome to change regulatory methods. But it also helps him deflect any opposition from large, politically potent telephone companies, which can simply ignore the plan if they feel they can make more money under traditional regulation.    Two of the FCC commissioners who approved the plan indicated that they also wanted steeper price cuts. James Quello said he wanted the regional Bell companies to cut their interstate rates 3% immediately. Under this idea, the Bell companies would probably have to reduce their rates a smaller annual amount than under the FCC proposal.    In addition, Commissioner Patricia Diaz Dennis questioned whether existing rates, which have evolved under traditional regulation, are too high and should be lowered before they are capped. The FCC will seek public comment on the plan before it votes on a final order, probably late this year.    ATandamp;T responded cautiously to the FCC proposal, saying it didn't expect a number of the plan's elements, including that which makes it voluntary. In a prepared statement, ATandamp;T said: &quot;Some of the changes we heard discussed today raised concerns that several of the proposed rules may be more burdensome than those we have today.&quot;    ATandamp;T has been particularly concerned that the Bell companies, which supply ATandamp;T with local connections, would have the same freedom to price as ATandamp;T.    But analysts said the FCC proposal, while less generous to ATandamp;T than past FCC ideas on ATandamp;T deregulation, would clearly help the telephone giant make more money. Whether consumers will benefit is less clear, said Robert Morris III, of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    Yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading ATandamp;T shares rose 50 cents to close at $27.375.    The FCC's Mr. Patrick has made the price-cap plan a personal crusade. He first proposed the idea when he was an FCC commissioner in December 1986-four months before becoming chairman. Last August, the FCC formally proposed capping prices in a plan that was short on details. After threats from Congress to torpedo the plan, the commission promised a more-detailed version.    The price-cap plan proposed yesterday shows an attempt by Mr. Patrick, who is generally considered an ideological hardliner, to compromise. Aside from making the plan optional for phone companies, the agency set the starting date for next April -- after a new president takes office and names a new FCC chairman.    He also said that if Congress wanted the FCC to make the plan mandatory or to require immediate rate cuts, he was willing to deal. &quot;We can reassess,&quot; he said.    Nevertheless, the plan is certain to remain controversial on Capitol Hill. In a joint statement, House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) and telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Edward Markey (D., Mass.) asked whether the plan will &quot;bring better service to the public at lower prices or will simply provide a profit windfall for the industry?&quot;    Moreover, that payoff isn't guaranteed to every customer. The agency divided phone rates into two categories: one for regular long-distance, the other for private lines. Each of those categories is capped by the FCC formula. But within those categories, companies can raise or lower individual rates 5% a year without drawing much FCC scrutiny, as long as the overall categories comply with the rules.    Mr. Patrick touted the price caps as a way of prodding phone companies toward increased productivity and cost-cutting.    ---   Janet Guyon in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
