Meanwhile, Sen. David Boren, chairman of the IntelligenceCommittee, questioned whether Bush was given enough information, inthe right context, to make a crucial decision as the uprising tookplace.   U.S. forces had information indicating troops loyal to Gen.Manuel Antonio Noriega were being flown into Tocumen airportseveral miles east of Panama City Tuesday morning, but had noauthorization to share that information with the rebels.   However, said Boren, D-Okla., the rebels believed thereinforcements were coming from another direction, and had askedU.S. forces to block two other roads they believed would be used bythe loyalists, leaving the airport road clear.   ``I just don't believe the information was distilled andpresented to (Bush) in a way that gave him an understanding of theyes-or-no decision he had to make'' on whether to authorizeblocking of the airport road, Boren said.   Boren also said no senior personnel from the CentralIntelligence Agency were present during White House meetings todeal with the coup on Monday and Tuesday.   Nunn said there should have been definite arrangements for howU.S. troops were to react in the event of a coup.   ``We have had a definite, longstanding policy in this country ofencouraging a coup'' in Panama, Nunn, D-Ga., told reporters. ``Weshould anticipate that our policy ... might succeed. Then we haveto know what we're going to do next.''   Nunn, who was among senators who met Friday with DefenseSecretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, said many of the specific facts of the coupremained murky and were under continuing congressionalinvestigation.   A report from the Armed Services and Intelligence Committees wasbeing prepared, but was expected to be delayed by declassificationprocedures at least until next week.   Nunn complained, ``There were no real plans as to how the peopleon the ground (in Panama) were to react'' if a coup took place. ``Ido think there were implicit kinds of commitments made when wecalled for the overthrow.''   Had U.S. officials known what questions to ask of the coupleaders and under what circumstances they were free to intervene,the outcome might have been far different, he said.   Nunn said officials of the U.S. Southern Command, based inPanama City, should have been under standing instructions todetermine the intent of any leaders of a coup: Did they intend torecognize and support the duly elected government which was thrownout by Noriega? Did they want U.S. intelligence data? Would theyturn Noriega over to U.S. authorities?   On all of those questions, American personnel groped throughoutthe morning Tuesday until any opportunity for the United States tobecome involved evaporated, Nunn said.   If there had been clear answers, ``The whole flow of eventsmight have changed. It would have put us in a totally differentlegal and moral position,'' he said.   Nunn said the United States failed to make proper use of its ownintelligence by bringing appropriate officials together and poolinginformation flowing in from all sources. The situation was furthercomplicated by the simultaneous visit of President Salinas ofMexico and a senior Soviet military official, he said.   ``All of those entered into this'' and further underlined theneed for advance policy setting and contingency planning, said Nunn.   On one disputed point _ whether the rebels asked for help ingetting Noriega out of the headquarters building where they heldhim _ Nunn said he tended to accept Cheney's version that no suchrequest was made.   During a visit to Capitol Hill Friday, Bush visited SenateMajority Leader George Mitchell to explain what he had known onTuesday when he decided not to commit U.S. force to the coupattempt.   Mitchell, D-Maine, said he related to Bush the concern manysenators have about whether the United States passed up anopportunity to apprehend Noriega, but said Bush and chief of staffJohn Sununu ``emphatically and categorically'' denied such anopportunity existed.</TEXT></DOC>
