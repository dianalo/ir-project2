The disclosure came during testimony by former national securityadviser Robert McFarlane, North's onetime boss at the NationalSecurity Council.   North lawyer Brendan Sullivan questioned McFarlane about a ``topsecret'' Oct. 3, 1985 memo from North to McFarlane in which Northrecommended the U.S. government air-drop intelligence to the Contras.   As McFarlane examined the memo on the witness stand, Sullivansaid McFarlane's deputy, John Poindexter, approved therecommendation and that Poindexter added the words: ``Presidentapproved.''   The approval came at a time when the Boland Amendment prohibitedany U.S. government agency involved in intelligence activities fromusing money to assist the Contras.   According to Sullivan's description of the memo, the steps Northrecommended were ``not only extraordinary, but also expensive'' andfollowed a meeting on the matter by the Restricted Agency Group.McFarlane described that as an interagency committee that made``recommendations on Nicaragua,'' with one deputy from each ofseveral departments involved in intelligence.   The last page of North's memo describes ``what to tell thepresident,'' said Sullivan, who read portions of it aloud.   One portion the lawyer read said that ``we intend to air dropintelligence along with two recoilless rifles which will be used tosink one or both of the arms carriers.''   McFarlane said the recoilless rifles are ``designed to knock outa very hard target'' such as a tank, a bunker or a plane on theground.''   ``Or sink a ship as it says here,'' added Sullivan.   McFarlane said the memo didn't come to him, since Poindexterdealt with it.   Poindexter, who succeeded McFarlane as President Reagan'snational security adviser, was in another courtroom today forhousekeeping matters concerning his case on charges that resembleNorth's.   U.S. District Judge Aubrey Robinson said he hoped thatPoindexter's Iran-Contra trial can get under way in summer or earlyfall, after North's trial ends, and that he has not decided whetherhe or another judge will preside.   The case had been in Gesell's court, but the judge decided hedidn't want to hear it. In the meantime, Robinson said, he will takecare of any pre-trial matters.   Independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh told the judge he does notknow yet whether the government will follow its action in the Northcase and drop two key charges _ conspiracy, and theft of governmentproperty _ that had been lodged against Poindexter.   McFarlane testified Wednesday at North's trial that inducementsworth $110 million were discussed orally with Honduras' presidentbut not given to him in writing.   The Honduran deal and other third-country help to the Contraswere kept secret because the countries' relations with Congresswould be ``damaged'' if the support was disclosed, said McFarlane.Also, exposure would touch off a confrontation with Congress, hesaid.   Four of the charges against North are that he lied to Congress in1985 by denying that he was involved in assisting the Contras.   A Sept. 13, 1984, memo from North to McFarlane detailed how anassistant secretary of state told congressional intelligencecommittees that foreign countries were providing support to theContras but that the State Department official didn't know whichones.   McFarlane acknowledged he took no steps to inform Congress ofwhat he, Reagan and others in the administration knew at the time,that Saudi Arabia was providing $1 million a month for the Contras.   The secret payments to Honduras amounted to $35 million inspeeded-up deliveries of rifles, ammunition, machine guns and othermilitary aid, plus $75 million in economic assistance. In addition,there is other unspecified assistance that is classified and whichhas not been disclosed at the trial.   Reagan initialed his approval of the Honduran plan on a memodated Feb. 18, 1985.   ``You're going to give them tens of millions of dollars tocooperate?'' North lawyer Brendan Sullivan asked McFarlane.   ``Yes.''   ``There is nothing dirty about quid pro quo, is there?''   ``No.''   The Honduran arrangement was made near the beginning of atwo-year span in which the so-called the Boland Amendment prohibitedU.S. military aid to the guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
