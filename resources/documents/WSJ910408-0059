Beall, Rockwell chairman and chief executiveofficer, also said that earnings for the company's secondquarter, ended March 31, should be &quot;somewhat below 1990'sstrong second quarter (profit) of 70 cents per share.&quot; Netincome in the year-earlier second quarter was $173.4 millionon sales of $3.15 billion.   Kent Black, chief operating officer of Rockwell, said theNetwork Transmission Systems Division's business &quot;is in goodshape today,&quot; but the company feels that it doesn't offer afull enough line of telephone communications products tocompete effectively in the future. So the best thing to do,he said, &quot;is to sell now&quot; since &quot;we will get good value forour shareholders and our employees will have a brighterfuture&quot; that way.   Lior Bregman, an analyst for Oppenheimer andamp; Co., said thatRockwell would have to make a &quot;heavy investment&quot; in telephonecommunications products &quot;to stay ahead of the competition&quot;and that the company made a decision to put its resourceselsewhere. &quot;You must be a large player to be successful inthat market,' he said.   Rockwell said it has retained Dillon Read andamp; Co. of NewYork as its adviser in selling the division. The division has3,600 employees, primarily at its principal offices inRichardson, Texas.   As for the outlook for the full fiscal year, Mr. Beallsaid that &quot;even with the uncertainties of the currenteconomic environment, we continue to believe our 1991earnings per share will be somewhat higher than in fiscal1990.&quot; In fiscal 1990, ended Sept. 30, Rockwell posted net of$624.3 million, or $2.56 a share, on sales of $12.37 billion.   Rockwell is involved in electronics, aerospace, automotiveand graphics businesses.</TEXT></DOC>
