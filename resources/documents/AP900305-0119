Flight 195, carrying 14 passengers and a crew of five, wasturned around because of remarks by two people who approached thegate as the plane was preparing to take off, said Susan Young, aspokeswoman for USAir in Arlington.   They demanded that the plane be brought back so they couldboard, Ms. Young said.   When the couple was told that was impossible, ``they maderemarks to the effect that `you'll bring it back,' and somecomments about a bomb in their luggage,'' Ms. Young said.   By then, the plane had taken off. USAir officials in Norfolkrecalled the plane, which landed without incident around 2:45 p.m.   The plane was taken to a remote part of the field, and one pieceof luggage was taken off, said Wayne Shank, the airport's deputyexecutive director.
