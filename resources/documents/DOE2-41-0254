The analysis is done by non-destructiveassay by passive gamma ray counting, chemical analysis, and solid statenuclear track detector (SSNTD) technique. The details of the developmentof NDA method to suit the requirements of the sample are given. The difficultiesencountered in chemical assay are described. SSNTD method was appliedto such materials for the estimation of the uranium for the first time.A simple scheme for the recovery of uranium and the salt mixture fromthe fused salt cake is also described.
