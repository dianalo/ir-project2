The PLA was the military force that swept the Communists topower in 1949, establishing along the way a reputation of devotionto China's peasant masses.   In a country where armies often have attracted riffraffinterested primarily in rape and plunder, the army of revolutionaryleader Mao Tse-tung went to great effort to serve the people andtreat them decently.   The army's Eight Points for Attention include: fair pay forpurchases, the return of all borrowed items, no hitting orswearing, no damage to crops and no liberties with women.   That attitude won over millions of people to the Communistcause, and the image of servant to the masses is still nurtured bythe army.   ``The People's Army loves the people,'' has been a refrain fromsoldiers and Beijing residents alike since troops were sent torestore order in the capital, where more than 1 million people havedemonstrated for a more democratic society, press freedom and anend to official corruption.   But the PLA, which has about 3.2 million soldiers, also hasshown loyalty to individual leaders, first Mao and now 84-year-oldsenior leader Deng Xiaoping, who is thought to be the main forcebehind the hard-line stance against student demonstrators.   The argument by Deng and his followers that a crackdown onpro-democracy students occupying Tiananmen Square in centralBeijing is necessary to restore order strikes a responsive chordamong many military leaders.   The problem, however, is that the people of Beijing and othermajor Chinese cities have taken to the streets daily to support theTiananmen students and demand the ouster of Premier Li Peng, themost vocal champion of a crackdown.   That outpouring of support for student activists cannot beignored by an army that prides itself as being of the people.   Indications are that a split has developed among the militaryover how to proceed.   On Monday, more than 100 senior military officers signed aletter opposing Li's declaration of martial law in Beijing, sayingthe PLA ``will never shoot the people.''   Former Defense Minister Zhang Aiping and former PLA Chief ofStaff Yang Dezhi were among those who wrote the letter, accordingto a source at the People's Daily.   The same day, however, the top army command signed a lettersupporting Li's imposition of martial law in Beijing on Saturday.It said ``an extreme minority of people are fanning the flames,creating turmoil, with the goal of negating the leadership of theChinese Communist Party and the socialist system.''   Caught in the middle are the thousands of soldiers sent toBeijing to restore order. Many were deployed on the city'soutskirts for several days, the road to Tiananmen blocked by tensof thousands of residents, before retreating to nearby barracks.   During the standoff, the soldiers were befriended by the peopleof Beijing. The young soldiers were fed, entertained, lectured,and, most importantly, admonished by students and grandparentsalike not to attack the protesters.   Some soldiers clearly were moved.</TEXT></DOC>
