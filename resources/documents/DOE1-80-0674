The major theme of the report is that effectivetechnology transfer is a collaborative, cooperative process, not simplythe transfer of a product. The process is best managed by (1) activelyidentifying both the technology needs of industry and the technologydevelopment capabilities of laboratories, and (2) mediating these needsand capabilities to ensure that the resources available to develop newtechnologies are focused on the most urgently needed and readily acceptedproblems. In applying these concepts to the federal laboratories, theconference participants concluded that research directors should keepabreast of industrial needs and actively market the capabilities of federallaboratories to meet those needs.</TEXT></DOC>
