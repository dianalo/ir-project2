The treaty offers a precedent for tackling an issue that only nowis reaching the spotlight _ the global warming of the ``greenhouseeffect'' produced by burning fossil fuels.   Overall, the environmental report card is mixed. Theadministration, after initially favoring inaction, sharply reducedemissions of lead to the atmosphere from gasoline. Urban smog,though, remains a mess for more than 107 cities more than a yearpast the deadline for meeting clean air standards and Congress hasnot decided what to do next.   Water pollution cleanup remains uneven, with fouled beaches inthe headlines and more and more discoveries of groundwatercontamination.   Cleanup of toxic waste dumps under the ``Superfund,'' program, a$1.5-billion-a-year effort now, is painfully slow, expensive andcontroversial. Only a handful have been completed.   As a society, ``We have misused the opportunities that presentedthemselves'' in the last eight years, said Peter A.A. Berle,president of the National Audubon Society.   But Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks andConservation Association, said of the environmental community, ``Wehave hung the noose around ourselves.   ``We as leaders of the environmental community should not endorsepresidential candidates,'' he said, referring to the 1980 RoseGarden appearance of many of those leaders endorsing Jimmy Carter asindividuals.   Reagan came to office after scorning environmentalist positions,noting that trees pollute _ which is a fact. Environmentalistsreturned the scorn with jokes about ``killer trees.''   One of the new administration's first acts was to cut the WhiteHouse Council on Environmental Quality from 50 positions to eight.   Reagan's choice to head the Enviromental Protection Agency, AnneBurford, didn't even arrive at the agency until four months afterthe inauguration and gave the impression she believed thebureaucracy was the enemy.   She didn't know Washington. She accepted savage cuts from theOffice of Management and Budget, at first not fighting for funds.She rarely consulted members of Congress or had environmentalists inher office.   Loyal to the president, she withheld documents from Congress onhis instructions over her own misgivings. She fired the assistantadministrator in charge of the Superfund, Rita Lavelle, for lying.When the smoke cleared, Mrs. Burford had been eased out and Ms.Lavelle was in prison, convicted of lying to Congress, too.   The first interior secretary, James Watt, was convinced thatoverblown environmental worries were locking away valuableresources. Watt, almost the embodiment of the ``SagebrushRebellion'' resentment of federal control of western lands, wasdetermined to unlock them and to taunt environmentalists, too.   After Watt, the sagebrush rebellion petered out, according tosome analysts, under recognition by Washington's Western criticsthat they benefitted from federally subsidized electricity, grazingrights, irrigation water and timber sales.   _By Guy B.
