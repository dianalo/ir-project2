Baker III is advising Moscow to pull out ofregional wars around the world and put the billions of dollars savedinto the ailing Soviet economy.   The former treasury secretary, at a news conference Tuesday, alsofired back at Democratic critics of the Bush administration'scautious foreign policy and sought to lower expectations that a datewas about to be set for a superpower summit meeting.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze is due to seePresident Bush at the White House on Thursday. Then Baker andShevardnadze fly to Jackson Hole, Wyo., for talks through Sundaymorning.   At their last meeting in Paris in late July, Shevardnadze said,``If we prepare well and carefully, then of course the summit willtake place rather soon.'' Baker, more cautious, said at the timethat ``obviously yes, at some point'' a summit would take place.   At the news conference Tuesday, his first since taking over assecretary of state eight months ago, Baker was asked about a summitbetween Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   ``What I will say for you,'' he replied, ``is that it isanticipated and intended that we have a full discussion about thepossibility of a summit.''   Bush said on Monday, ``I feel under no rush on that subject.''   The stance struck by the president and his secretary of statereinforced the cautious character of U.S. foreign policy,particularly in dealing with the Soviets and Eastern Europe.   Turning to the sagging Soviet economy, Baker said, ``there are nosimple or quick fixes.'' But he suggested the Soviets withdraw fromconflicts in Central America, Cambodia, Afghanistan, Cuba, Ethiopiaand elsewhere.   Besides contributing to international stability, Baker said, ``Itcould also save the Soviets billions of dollars that we still seespent in a disappointing pattern of support for those who fuelconflict...''   He was especially harsh about Soviet support for the Marxistgovernment of Nicaragua.   While Gorbachev promised to end direct Soviet military aid to theSandinistas, Baker said weapons and other supplies were beingchanneled to them indirectly. He apparently referred to Cuba andsome East European countries.   ``We think they (the Soviets) could have a significant influenceon reducing (Sandinista forces) if they so chose,'' Baker said.   ``They are spending billions of dollars in regional conflictsituations that we think could be put to better use to assist theprocess of perestroika,'' he said, using the Russian word forreconstruction.   Baker rejected Democratic criticism that the Bush administrationwas overly cautious on arms control and in responding to economicproblems in Eastern Europe.   He said he hoped to conclude a chemical weapons agreement withShevardnadze by the weekend. And Baker announced that the Bushadministration will drop its proposal for a ban on U.S. and Sovietmobile missiles.   With Bush urging Congress to finance development of thesingle-warhead Midgetman, Baker acknowledged that the U.S.negotiating position has been confusing.   He said his aim was ``to start the ball rolling'' in theslow-moving talks in Geneva to reduce globe-girdling U.S. and Sovietnuclear bombers, submarines and missiles by 30 to 50 percent.   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., called Baker's announcement ``a verysmall step that has long been awaited and expected because theproposal for a ban always was considered irrational, even within theadministration.''   Still, Gore said in an interview, ``the decision to remove it nowis symbolically important. It points toward a reliance onsinge-warhead missiles by both sides, which greatly reducesvulnerabilities and fears of aggression.''</TEXT></DOC>
