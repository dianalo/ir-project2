Atkins, on trial in a major tax-fraud case, testified that corporate raider Asher B. Edelman helped &quot;facilitate&quot; some of the Atkins group's transactions for a 1% fee.    Mr. Edelman isn't accused of any wrongdoing, and the fact that he engaged in transactions with the Atkins group had been disclosed in pretrial papers filed by the government in May. Those papers listed Mr. Edelman among a long group of potential &quot;co-conspirators and/or agents&quot; in the Atkins case.    Mr. Atkins is on trial with two other men in U.S. District Court in Manhattan on charges that between 1978 and 1983 his tax-shelter operation generated more than $1.3 billion of fictitious losses through &quot;prearranged, riskless&quot; trades in government securities. The losses were used by Atkins clients -- many of them prominent businessmen and celebrities -- for millions of dollars in unwarranted tax deductions, the government alleges.    The testimony yesterday indicated that a number of securities firms engaged in securities trades with the Atkins group. Two firms controlled by Mr. Edelman were among companies identified as being involved in the purchase or sale of securities.    Reached yesterday, Mr. Edelman said: &quot;I certainly did nothing wrong.&quot; He added that if the trial demonstrates that any fraud occurred, &quot;then we were the ones defrauded. It's crazy.&quot;    Though Mr. Edelman wasn't accused of wrongdoing in the testimony by former Atkins partner Joseph J. Riley, Mr. Riley said Mr. Edelman knew the Atkins group's transactions would entail no &quot;economic risk&quot; -- in other words, that they were solely to generate tax losses for the Atkins group and a fee for Mr. Edelman. The government charges that the Atkins group's records were inaccurate because they don't state that such transactions entailed no economic risk. Mr. Riley pleaded guilty earlier this year and is a witness for the government.    Mr. Edelman in 1979 agreed to participate in the Atkins group's transactions for a fee of 1% of the amount of tax losses taken in that current year, Mr. Riley testified. The next year, he added, Mr. Edelman was told the Atkins group needed additional tax losses for the year. According to Mr. Riley, Mr. Edelman responded: &quot;No problem.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
