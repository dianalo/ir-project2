For years I asked the local school board andsuperintendent to let me teach a curriculum that doesn't hurtkids, but they had other fish to fry. So I'm going to quit, Ithink.   I've come slowly to understand what it is I really teach:a curriculum of confusion, class position, arbitrary justice,vulgarity, rudeness, disrespect for privacy, indifference toquality, and utter dependency. I teach how to fit into aworld I don't want to live in.</LP><TEXT>   I just can't do it anymore. I can't train children to waitto be told what to do; I can't train people to drop what theyare doing when a bell sounds; I can't persuade children tofeel some justice in their class placement when there isn'tany, and I can't persuade children to believe teachers havevaluable secrets they can acquire by becoming our disciples.That isn't true.   Government schooling is the most radical adventure inhistory. It kills the family by monopolizing the best timesof childhood and by teaching disrespect for home and parents.   An exaggeration? Hardly. Parents aren't meant toparticipate in our form of schooling, rhetoric to thecontrary. My orders as schoolteacher are to make children fitan animal training system, not to help each find his or herpersonal path.   The whole blueprint of school procedure is Egyptian, notGreek or Roman. It grows from the faith that human value is ascarce thing, represented symbolically by the narrow peak ofa pyramid.   That idea passed into American history through thePuritans. It found its &quot;scientific&quot; presentation in the bellcurve, along which talent supposedly apportions itself bysome Iron Law of biology.   It's a religious idea and school is its church. New YorkCity hires me to be a priest. I offer rituals to keep heresyat bay. I provide documentation to justify the heavenlypyramid.   Socrates foresaw that if teaching became a formalprofession something like this would happen. Professionalinterest is best served by making what is easy to do seemhard; by subordinating laity to priesthood. School has becometoo vital a jobs project, contract-giver and protector of thesocial order to allow itself to be &quot;reformed.&quot; It haspolitical allies to guard its marches.   That's why reforms come and go -- without changing much.Even reformers can't imagine school much different.   David learns to read at age four; Rachel, at age nine: Innormal development, when both are 13, you can't tell whichone learned first -- the five-year spread means nothing atall. But in school I will label Rachel &quot;learning disabled&quot;and slow David down a bit, too.   For a paycheck, I adjust David to depend on me to tell himwhen to go and stop. He won't outgrow that dependency. Iidentify Rachel as discount merchandise, &quot;special education.&quot;After a few months she'll be locked into her place forever.   In 26 years of teaching rich kids and poor I almost nevermet a &quot;learning disabled&quot; child; hardly ever met a &quot;giftedand talented&quot; one, either. Like all school categories, theseare sacred myths, created by the human imagination. Theyderive from questionable values we never examine because theypreserve the temple of schooling.   That's the secret behind short-answer tests, bells,uniform time blocks, age grading, standardization, and allthe rest of the school religion punishing our nation.   There isn't a right way to become educated; there are asmany ways as fingerprints. We don't need state-certifiedteachers to make education happen -- that probably guaranteesit won't.   How much more evidence is necessary? Good schools don'tneed more money or a longer year; they need real free-marketchoices, variety that speaks to every need and runs risks. Wedon't need a national curriculum, or national testing either.Both initiatives arise from ignorance of how people learn, ordeliberate indifference to it.   I can't teach this way any longer. If you hear of a jobwhere I don't have to hurt kids to make a living, let meknow. Come fall I'll be looking for work, I think.   ---   Mr. Gatto is New York State Teacher of the Year for 1991,a title conferred by the State Education Department.</TEXT></DOC>
