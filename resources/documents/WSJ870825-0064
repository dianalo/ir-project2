Potash prices are likely to rise as a result of last week's U.S. Commerce Department determination that imports from Canada, which amounted to $340 million last year, are being sold in the U.S. at unfairly low prices. Higher prices would benefit all producers in the short term, industry analysts say.    But the preliminary decision has widened a rift between U.S. producers with U.S. production operations, primarily at Carlsbad, N.M., and those with Canadian supplies.    &quot;The whole situation is unique,&quot; says Stanley Deutsch, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., in New York. &quot;The Americans are biting themselves in the tail.&quot;    The potash ruling, which is subject to confirmation by the Commerce Department and the International Trade Commission, is the latest in a series of commodity-trade disputes between the two resource-rich giants, involving such items as hogs, pork, fish and fresh flowers. The department's preliminary finding requires the U.S. Customs Service to ask importers to make cash deposits or post bonds to cover potential anti-dumping duties on Canadian potash, which accounts for more than 80% of U.S. supplies.    While a price increase brought by the threat of import duties seems likely to heighten the financial pressures on U.S. farmers, it isn't likely to damp consumption much, industry analysts say. Potash prices, down roughly 30% in the past several years, to about $70 a ton, are severely depressed, and the expected moderate increase of about $5 to $10 a ton isn't likely to have much impact.    Neither is the ruling expected to hurt plans by International Minerals andamp; Chemical Corp., one of the major suppliers affected, to make a public offering of a &quot;substantial&quot; part of its IMC Fertilizer Group Inc., the company said. &quot;We're still moving ahead,&quot; said a spokesman for the Northbrook, Ill.-based firm.    But the ruling, in an unusual twist, pitted U.S. producers against each other in a dumping dispute. Lining up in favor of the department's ruling were Lundberg Industries Ltd., Dallas, and New Mexico Potash Corp., Memphis, Tenn.    Among U.S. producers cited in the ruling because of potash produced at their Canadian operations were IMC and Kalium Chemicals, a Canadian unit of PPG Industries Inc., Pittsburgh. Another company mentioned, Potash Co. of America, is the Denver-based unit of Rio Algom Ltd., a Toronto subsidiary of Rio Tinto-Zinc Corp., of England. Several Canadian producers, including Central Canada Potash, a division of Toronto-based Noranda Inc., were also affected.    While the Commerce Department is only considering imposing duties rather than any ban on potash imports, an affirmation of the ruling could effectively force some importers of Canadian potash to halt U.S. sales.    Under the preliminary ruling, duties would be based on the amount by which the Canadian-market price of the potash exceeds the price in the U.S. Those potential duties vary by company from about 9% of the price in the U.S. to about 85% -- a level importers would no doubt find prohibitive. A final Commerce Department decision is set for Nov. 3.    International Minerals common shares closed yesterday at $47.25, down 50 cents, in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange. PPG Industries closed on the Big Board at 47.75, down 62.5 cents.    Whatever the outcome, producers from U.S. sources can't begin to meet U.S. potash demand alone. Only 15% of U.S. supplies of the potassium-based substance, one of three basic fertilizers that are crucial to most major U.S. crops, come from domestic sources. Any severe curbs on the flow of imports from Canada would likely result in an increase in imports from Israel, another major producer.    &quot;The small producers in Carlsbad (N.M.) can't ultimately supply all the needs of the U.S.,&quot; an industry analyst said.    ---                Source of U.S. Potash Supplies                       (In percent) Canada .................................. 82% Domestic ................................ 15% Other non-U.S. ........................... 3%   Source: The Fertilizer Institute</TEXT></DOC>
