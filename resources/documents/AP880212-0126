In rejecting the offer, the Stop andamp; Shop board said the $1.03billion buyout, a bid of $37 a share, was inadequate and not in thebest interests of the company or its stockholders.   Among the board's considerations was information that Dart hasyet to secure commitments to provide financing for its offer, Stopandamp; Shop said in a statement. Stop andamp; Shop also said it was exploringalternatives to the unsolicited offer, including a possible sale ofthe firm.   A company statement said Stop andamp; Shop had received ``indicationsof interest from third parties for a transaction with the company.''   But Haft said Dart was prepared to compete for Stop andamp; Shop.   ``If there is a higher bona fide alternative to our offer, weintend to bid against it,'' Haft said in a telephone interview.   Stop andamp; Shop said its other alternatives included exploring aleveraged buyout, recapitalization or other restructuring. In aleveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to purchase a companyand then pay off the debt with the company's cash flow or the saleof its assets. Stop andamp; Shop, which operates 141 supermarkets and 171Bradlees department stores around the country, has said publicly itprefers to remain independent.   The statement referred to Dart's history of making millions ofdollars in profits through failed takeover bids. Many analystsdoubt that Dart is sincere in wanting to acquire and operate aretail company.   Haft denied his company had made its offer solely to profit fromits Stop andamp; Shop holdings. The Dart Group has acquired 738,220shares of Stop andamp; Shop, 2.7 percent of the outstanding shares.   Haft said Dart had begun the process under which it could call aspecial meeting of Stop andamp; Shop shareholders for the purpose ofreplacing the company's board with directors more sympathetic tothe offer.   Stop andamp; Shop stock fell 50 cents Thursday to $36.87{ a share inNew York Stock Exchange trading. Announcemennt of the rejectioncame after the close of trading.   Haft and his father Herbert, the chairman of Dart, had offered$31 a share for the retailer, and earlier this week raised the bidto $37.   In Hartford, Conn., officials at Local 919 of the United Food andamp;Commercial Workers' Union said Thursday they have retained a teamof lawyers, investment bankers and other advisers to explore theworkers' options in the face of the Dart bid.   The union also requested a meeting with Stop andamp; Shop directors.   ``We are exploring all and every appropriate alternative toprotect the interests and jobs of the employees we represent,''said local president Arnold F. Espinosa.   Among the options being considered are seeking a ``whiteknight,'' a suitor sympathetic to the employees' interests, and anemployee stock ownership plan in a possible leveraged buyout,Espinosa said.   The Hartford local, which represents 10,000 Stop andamp; Shop workers,is leading the effort on behalf of other locals. Stop andamp; Shop has atotal of 35,000 workers.</TEXT></DOC>
