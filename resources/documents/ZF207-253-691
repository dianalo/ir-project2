LyonsandM;A massive cost-cutting program that Borland International Inc. began inAugust has started to pay off, according to company officials.andM;After a year of spotty earnings -- and a big loss in September -- Borlandexpects to post a profit for its third fiscal quarter, which ended Dec.andP;  31,noted Alan Henricks, the company's chief financial officer.andP;  ''We feel likewe've turned the corner,'' he  said.andM;While the news from Borland headquarters in Scotts Valley, Calif., appearshopeful, the news from London, where Borland's stock trades, has been dismal.andO;In December, Borland shares hit 60 pence ($1.09 U.S.) -- their all-time low.andM;Last week Borland shares traded at about 66 pence, roughly half their pricewhen the company first floated stock on the Unlisted Securities Market (USM)in 1986, and less than 25 percent of their all-time high of nearly 287 pencein 1987.andM;In the last year, Borland and several other American companies listed on theUSM have produced disappointing results.andP;  Consequently, those companies havebeen bashed in the British press and by London traders, who grumble that theAmerican companies duped British investors.andM;British investors are now leery of American companies, particularly Borland.andO;''U.K.andP;  people aren't trusting the company,'' one London trader said.andP;  ''TheU.K.andP;  investors want to see the [profits] coming through before they supportthe company any further.''andM;Borland will come through with the numbers, Henricks said.andP;  Third-quarterprofits will be narrow because the company is still absorbing reorganizationcosts, but in the fourth quarter, the benefits of Borland's cost-cuttingmeasures should really kick in, he explained.andM;Borland has reduced costs by almost $1 million a month, by paring back itswork force, reorganizing some R and D efforts, spending less on advertisingand scrapping its user magazine, which was called Turbo Technix.andM;Gains in the third and fourth quarters will be offset by heavy losses earlierin the year, and analysts expect Borland to finish fiscal 1989 with a netloss of about $4 million on sales of about $95 million.andM;For fiscal 1990, however, analysts expect more promising results: a netprofit of about $8 million on sales of $110 million.andM;London traders have also been heartened recently by Borland Chairman PhilippeKahn's purchase of 50,000 shares of Borland stock in December.andM;Also, analysts say Borland has strengthened its management team with theaddition of some industry veterans, most notably Dan Crane, a former ToshibaAmerica Inc. vice president, who joined Borland in November as vice presidentof sales and marketing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
