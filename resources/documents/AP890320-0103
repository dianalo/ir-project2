Idon't yet know what it is,'' he told a group of women statelegislators.   Later, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater toldreporters ``clearly there's been some evolution of his (Bush's)thinking'' on gun control.   Fitzwater also voiced White House concerns over reports that NRAofficials had hinted at political repercussions to national drugcontrol Director William Bennett if he cracks down too hard on gunsales.   ``This is not a time for threatening people, but time to worktogether,'' Fitzwater said.   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told the AssociatedPress last week that Bennett had been receiving warnings from therifle association through third parties hinting that NRA's campaignfundraising abilities might be used against him if he ever soughtpolitical office.   Bennett said through a spokesman, Don Hamilton, that ``there havebeen a lot of phone calls, a lot of pressure. Let's cool off.'' Atthe time, NRA official Wayne LaPierre called the allegations``absolutely ridiculous.''   Bush directed Bennett to review the entire issue ofsemi-automatic weapons. Fitzwater said today that the administrationwould take no further action until that review is complete beyondlast week's banning of the import of semiautomatic weapons.   In his talk to women legislators, Bush said: ``On the NRA, ofwhich I am a member, a proud member, I believe we can find anaccommodation between the legitimate interest of sportsmen and theinterests of police chiefs, whose men put their lives on the lineevery day.''   ``We're in very different time now. I am convinced thatreasonable men and women can work together to find an answer to theproblem of these automated weapons,'' Bush said.   Bush's comments came against a backdrop of disagreement amongsenior federal officials over how fast and far the government shouldgo in urging gun manufacturers to follow the example of ColtIndustries Inc. and stop non-military sales of semiautomatic assaultrifles.   The head of the Drug Enforcement Administration, John Lawn, onSunday urged an end to such sales, but drug czar Bennett andAttorney General Dick Thornburgh advised caution.   ``I thought that was a very courageous action on the part ofColt. Guns are dangerous; law enforcement is suffering because ofthese guns,'' Lawn said on the CBS-TV program, ``Face the Nation.''   ``I am asking them to (take this action), on behalf of theofficers who are in danger every single day, because a policeofficer dies every 57 hours in this country,'' he said.   Colt announced that it was suspending sales of its AR-15semiautomatic rifle starting last Thursday, the day after PresidentBush decided to ban temporarily the import of foreign-made assaultrifles.   Bennett and Thornburgh urged a broader approach to combatingillegal narcotics and said there are limits on what the governmentcan tell private manufacturers of semiautomatic weapons.   ``This is not a dictatorship,'' Bennett said on CBS. ``We do nottell people how to do their business.''   But in a separate appearance on the NBC-TV program, ``Meet thePress,'' Bennett said: ``I think we can make the case that we don'tneed a whole lot more assault rifles on our streets right now.''   Bennett also said ``we have to get ... the person who issometimes called the casual user. One expert in this field has toldme that 70 percent of the cocaine that's used in this country isused by the so-called recreational user, the yuppie user.''   That person, Bennett said, ``needs to realize ... the kinds ofthings he's responsible for _ the murder and mayhem that's going onin Washington, the fact that we have babies now being born addictedto cocaine, the murder of DEA agents in other countries.   ``These people are accessories to all those things, and they needto start paying a price for that. .. If you're using cocaine anddriving around in your BMW, when you get stopped you lose your BMW.There are ways we can make people pay the price and help themrecognize what they're doing to the nation's children.''   Thornburgh cautioned against believing that ``gimmicks'' couldstop drug abuse.   ``If we think that the only way to deal with the drug problem isto ban a particular type of weapon, we're dead wrong,'' Thornburghsaid on the ABC-TV program, ``This Week with David Brinkley.''   Addressing the issue of drug use in nation's capital, Bennettsaid he had not yet decided whether to declare the federal districta ``high intensity drug trafficking area,'' enabling him to assemblea government strike force to fight drug dealing in Washington.   As of Sunday, 118 murders had been reported in Washington in1989, a record rate, and police say that nearly all are drug-related.   The Washington Post, quoting unidentified Bennett aides, saidSunday that the strike force would target repeat drug offenders, tryto shut down the city's 90 open-air drug markets, and use abandonedmilitary facilities as temporary prisons for drug offenders.   ``We are looking at whether we should do that or not,'' Bennettsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
