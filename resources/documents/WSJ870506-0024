The bond rally came as the government launched its $29 billion financing operation. Although some analysts were encouraged by yesterday's note sale results, concern remains widespread about how much investors, especially Japanese institutions, will buy at the auctions of longer-term notes and bonds today and tomorrow.    Activity in the foreign exchange markets was light. But trading was heavy in the stock market, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average beginning its sharp rise right at the opening bell. The average rose 51.85 points to 2338.07 in the fourth largest one-day gain ever.    The Treasury sold $10 billion of three-year notes at an average annual yield of 7.91%, the highest auction average on similar notes since February of last year. It also represented a sharp increase from the 6.54% average at the previous auction Feb. 3.    Prices of actively traded 30-year Treasury bonds climbed about three-quarters of a point, or $7.50 for each $1,000 face amount. Municipal and corporate bonds also advanced, while short-term interest rates fell.    The Treasury is scheduled to sell $9.75 billion of 10-year notes today, followed by $9.25 billion of 30-year bonds tomorrow, in what will be watched closely as barometers of Japanese investor appetite for U.S. debt. Without large purchases by Japanese institutions, interest rates will rise, many investment managers fear.    The three-year note sale yesterday &quot;is not a test,&quot; said Walter Wulkan, director of investment strategy at Gruntal andamp; Co. &quot;It's short enough for almost anyone no matter what their fears are. But if you're afraid of inflation or a continued decline of currencies, then you have to watch out for the 10-year and 30-year bonds.&quot; Prices of three-year notes are much less volatile than those of longer-term issues.    Opinion is split on how strongly Japanese investors will bid at today and tomorrow's auctions. &quot;If there is any real interest, it is held very close to the vest,&quot; said Robin Koskinen, a senior vice president at Nomura Securities Co.'s U.S. unit. &quot;We are not seeing a lot of people committing large sums at certain levels.&quot; He added, though, that the firm hasn't seen such advance evidence in the past, either.    Sumitomo Life Insurance Co., one of Japan's biggest institutional investors, is reluctant to buy aggressively in the auction, said Shigeki Nihei, a representative of the firm in New York. &quot;It's absolutely due to the dollar,&quot; he said, adding that he expects it to keep falling. In addition, he noted that with U.S. employment statistics for April scheduled for release Friday and the March trade figures due to be announced next week, &quot;There are still too many uncertainties&quot; in the markets.    One Japanese trader said that Japanese investors were disturbed by the apparent failure of last week's meeting between Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone and President Reagan to quell the growing trade conflict between the U.S. and Japan. That, he predicted, will continue to put downward pressure on the dollar, further diminishing Japanese investors' appetites for dollar-denominated securities.    Nevertheless, U.S. Treasury notes and bonds now yield over five percentage points more than comparable Japanese issues, which may lure Japanese investors. Also, the dollar has fallen so sharply that Japanese investors may conclude that the worst is over and that U.S. investments now look unusually attractive, some analysts say.    &quot;Some Japanese investors may say the future risk on the foreign exchange side is getting smaller,&quot; said Junichi Nishiwaki, chief economist of Mitsubishi Bank in Tokyo. That, he said, may be a factor encouraging more Japanese buying.    Takuro Isoda, chairman of Daiwa Securities Co.'s New York unit, said the wide difference between U.S. and Japanese interest rates is &quot;extremely delicious.&quot; Still, he said Japanese investment managers remain apprehensive that the dollar might drop further, and thus many of these money managers may hold off buying Treasurys until there are clearer signs the dollar has stabilized. &quot;A headache for most portfolio managers is short-term currency loss,&quot; Mr. Isoda said.    Despite persistent worries that U.S.-Japan trade conflict might prompt Tokyo officials to direct Japanese investors not to buy Treasurys, Mr. Isoda said: &quot;The trade friction matter is only a pimple on an elephant for portfolio managers. They don't have time to think of revenge on the trade side. They have to protect their own positions.&quot;    Speculation also is brewing that the Federal Reserve may tighten credit conditions further, pushing up short-term interest rates, in an effort to buttress the dollar. Allen Sinai, chief economist of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., predicted yesterday the Fed probably will raise its discount rate at least half a percentage point within a few weeks, both to support the dollar and demonstrate again its determination to keep inflation under control. The discount rate, now 5 1/2%, is the rate the Fed charges on loans to banks and savings institutions.    Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker repeatedly has emphasized his worry about the potentially inflationary implications of the dollar's decline. But other Fed officials have emitted conflicting signals. Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson of the Federal Reserve Board indicated yesterday that the Fed may avoid pushing interest rates higher even if the dollar continues to decline. Mr. Johnson said he didn't think it would be &quot;useful&quot; for the dollar to drop further but added that such a decline &quot;in and of itself is not inflationary,&quot; and therefore wouldn't necessarily require tighter credit in the U.S.    Shearson Lehman's index of long-term Treasury bonds rose yesterday 4.62 points to close at 1289.87. The index began at 1000 at the end of 1980. It ranged yesterday between 1283.37 and 1294.54.    The Treasury's 7 1/2% bonds due 2016 increased to a price of 88 from 87 8/32 Monday. The yield fell to 8.63% from 8.67%. The government's 7 1/4% notes due 1996 rose to 92 1/2 from 92 as the yield declined to 8.41% from 8.47%.    In when-issued trading, the new 10-year notes were quoted late yesterday at about 8.41%, while the 30-year bonds were quoted at about 8.6%.    Both the Japanese and London markets were closed Monday because of holidays. The Japanese markets were closed again yesterday for a holiday.    Rates fell on short-term Treasury bills. The rate on the latest three-month Treasury bill declined to 5.76% bid from an average rate of 5.81% set at Monday's auction. The rate on the latest six-month Treasury bill declined to 6.09% bid from an auction average of 6.16%.    At yesterday's note sale, the Treasury received bids for the three-year securities totaling $22.96 billion and accepted those in a range of 7.88% to 7.94%, including $1.01 billion of noncompetitive bids at the average yield. The Treasury accepted 26% of the bids it received at the highest yield. The average price was 99.908.    The Treasury sold an additional $780 million of the notes to foreign and international monetary authorities and a further $1.11 billion to government accounts and Federal Reserve banks. The coupon interest rate was set at 7 7/8%, up from 6 1/2% in February. The notes will be dated May 15 and will mature May 15, 1990.    In the municipal bond market, a large volume of new issues was offered to investors yesterday, and many sold briskly. These included:    --$120 million of Texas Coastal Water Authority water system revenue bonds. The unsold balance late yesterday totaled only about $10.4 million, according to underwriters led by First Boston Corp.
