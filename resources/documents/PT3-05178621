After insertion of the nail, a      plurality of screws are driven through the bone and nail transverse to the      longitudinal axis of the nail. To align the screw with transverse openings      in the nail, a targeting device is attached to the proximal portion of the      nail. It is typical for radio graphic pictures to be required during the      procedure to ensure alignment of screws prior to drilling through the      bone. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The targeting device of this invention includes a radio-transparent handle      and a metal snap fit barrel. The radio-transparent handle reduces      obstructions in the radio-graphic image to provide a clearer image to the      surgeon for proper placement of the locking screws. The metal snap fit      barrel is retained in the handle by an interference fit between the handle      and biased keys carried by the barrel. After use, the barrel may be easily      disassembled for cleaning by striking a removal tool against the keys to      drive the barrel from the handle. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, it is an object of the invention to provide for a novel      targeting device for a locking intramedullary rod. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide for a novel two piece      targeting device for an intramedullary nail. </PAR><PAR>  Another object of the invention is to provide for a targeting device for an      intramedullary nail having a radio-transparent handle. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object of the invention is to provide for a targeting device      for an intramedullary nail which is easily disassembled for cleaning. </PAR><PAR>  Yet another object of the invention is to provide for a targeting device      for an intramedullary nail that is economic to produce. </PAR><PAR>  Further objects of the invention will become apparent upon a reading of the      following description taken with the accompanying drawings. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a elevational view of the targeting device of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an elevational view of the metal guide barrel of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a sectional view of the guide barrel removal tool. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT </PAC><PAR>  The preferred embodiment herein described is not intended to be exhaustive      or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Rather, it is      chosen and described to best explain the invention so that others skilled      in the art might utilize its teachings. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to the figures, targeting device 10 is illustrated as      including a handle 12 formed from a radio-transparent plastic material. As      illustrated in the figures, handle 12 is generally C-shaped and includes a      rod engaging end 14 and a targeting end 16. Rod engaging end 14 includes a      throughbore 15 for accommodating the guide barrel 18. A recess is formed      in rod engaging end 14 defining shoulders 20. Throughbores 22 are formed      through targeting end 16 for accommodating a drill bushing (not shown) for      drilling into a patient's bone to accommodate a locking screw (also not      shown). A throughbore 24 is formed through handle 12 at a location between      throughbores 15 and 22. Throughbores 22 and 24 are oriented such that with      the handle 12 and guide barrel 18 contacting the proximal end of an      intramedullary (IM) nail (not shown), a drill bit passing through bores 22      and 24 would mate with corresponding bores in the IM nail. This feature is      common with many targeting guides and is not to be considered unique to      this invention. </PAR><PAR>  Guide barrel 18 is generally of a tubular cross section and includes a      distal end 26 and a proximal end 28 divided by a collar 30. The distal end      26 of barrel 18 includes a pair of protrusions for mating with      corresponding notches on the proximal end of the IM nail. The proximal end      28 of the barrel is slotted to define a pair of spring arms 30. Each      spring arm 30 terminates in an arcuate lip 32 extending transversely from      arms 30. The proximal most edge of each lip 32 is bevelled to form a      caming surface. </PAR><PAR>  To connect guide barrel 18 with handle 12 for use, the proximal end 28 of      barrel 18 is placed in contact with the distal opening 13 of throughbore      15. Axial pressure is applied to the guide barrel, the bevelled surfaces      of lips 32 contact the handle about opening 13 which causes the spring      arms to cam inwardly toward each other. Continued axial pressure causes      the proximal end 28 of guide barrel 18 to travel along bore 15. When lips      32 pass through bore 15 and reach the recess, the arms spring outwardly      such that lips 32 overly the shoulders 20 to secure the barrel against      longitudinal movement relative to handle 12. The targeting device may now      engage an IM rod to provide alignment in a manner well known in the      industry. A locking bolt (not shown) may be inserted through the center of      tubular guide rod 18 to secure the targeting guide to the IM rod. </PAR><PAR>  During the procedure, it may be necessary to obtain radiographic images      such as X-rays. Since the handle of the invention is formed from a      radio-transparent material, the targeting guide may be left connected to      the IM rod without significantly obstructing the image. </PAR><PAR>  After the procedure, it is necessary to remove the guide barrel 18 for      cleaning of the handle and guide barrel. A removal tool 36 is provide as      illustrated in FIG. 3. Removal tool 36 includes a cylindrical rod having a      blind bore 38 formed in one end thereof. Bore 38 includes a bevelled edge      40. The bevelled edge 40 of tool 36 is placed against the bevelled outer      surface of lips 32. The exposed end of the removal tool is struck with      mallet. The cooperating bevelled surfaces of the tool and the lips cams      the spring arms together and drives the barrel into bore 15. The barrel      may now be pulled from the bore for cleaning. </PAR><PAR>  It should be understood that the exact location of the bores 22 and 24, as      well as the shape of handle 12, is dependant on the particular      configuration of the IM rod. </PAR><PAR>  It should be further understood that the invention is not to be limited to      the precise details above but may be modified within the scope of the      appended claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  We claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
