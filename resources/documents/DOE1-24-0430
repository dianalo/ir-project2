In1980 and 81, the results from several studies indicated that asthmatics'airways were substantially more responsive to SO{sub 2} than those ofnonasthmatic individuals and that, when combined with moderate exercise,significant bronchoconstriction resulted from exposures to as low as0.5 ppm SO{sub 2}. Since then, a multitude of reports regarding short-termexposure of asthmatics to low SO{sub 2} levels have appeared in the literature.From these studies, reflex bronchoconstriction, mast cell degranulationand other, yet unidentified, mechanisms were implicated in the inductionof response. A broad range of responsiveness to SO{sub 2} exists withinthe asthmatic population. Precise knowledge of factors involved in thisvariable responsiveness is lacking; differences in nonspecific airwaysensitivity and severity of disease are suggested.</TEXT></DOC>
