Mr. Levine pleaded guilty in June 1985 to insider trading, perjury and income-tax evasion. He was sentenced to four concurrent two-year prison terms and was fined $362,000.    The appeals court said that the Internal Revenue Service is entitled to payment of about $8.5 million. That amount is for a lien that the IRS filed against Mr. Levine before the SEC settlement was reached. The court said that federal and state tax claims assessed after the settlement couldn't be paid from the assets.    The tax liabilities are based on Mr. Levine's profit on allegedly unlawful stock transactions from 1980 to 1985.    The court said none of the $3.3 million disgorged by Robert M. Wilkis, also a former investment banker here, could be used to pay taxes. Mr. Wilkis agreed to the disgorgement in June 1986, also to settle SEC charges of insider trading. The appeals court said the disgorged assets of Mr. Wilkis can't be used to cover taxes because the taxes were assessed after the money was disgorged.    Mr. Wilkis pleaded guilty in December 1986 to insider trading, mail fraud, income-tax evasion and failure to report certain money transactions. He was sentenced to prison and probation.    The court upheld most of a federal district judge's decision on how the disgorged assets were to be used. The lower court had said, however, that the IRS wasn't entitled to collect taxes from the disgorged assets on the ground that the assets were obtained by wrongful means. U.S. District Judge Richard Owen had ordered that the assets be earmarked for defrauded investors.    But the appeals court said the assets couldn't go to defrauded investors because Messrs. Levine and Wilkis gave up the assets &quot;without admitting or denying the allegations.&quot; Although the men later admitted to criminal insider trading, their guilty plea didn't apply to the vast majority of the insider-trading accusations covered by the SEC settlement, the court said.    Mr. Levine's attorney, Arthur L. Liman, didn't return calls seeking comment. Marvin E. Frankel, attorney for Mr. Wilkis, said he hadn't yet read the court's decision and was unable to comment. </TEXT></DOC>
