When the war was over, the Russians and Poles came,killing many of the Germans living there and deporting therest of us in cattle cars. During the fall of 1989, I had theopportunity to go back to my hometown. The decay you soeloquently describe was everywhere. My parents' house wasonly a shadow of its appearance in 1945. A friendly, elderlyPole showed me around, and he seemed to remember what thearea had looked like when the new masters took over. Clearly,Germany's loss has not been Poland's gain.   I now live in this country, and I do not wish to tell theGermans or the Poles how to settle their differences.However, not all the injustices in the world were perpetratedby the Germans, and settling scores by taking land from thevanquished and expelling the inhabitants of those lands doesnot appear to be a solid foundation for peace. I hope alasting settlement of these thorny disputes can be reachedwithin a peaceful Europe.</LP><TEXT>   H.P. Pohlmann   Winfield, Ill.</TEXT></DOC>
