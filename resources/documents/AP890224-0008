An estimated 90,000 or more U.S. workers are exposed to thechemical solvent dimethlyformamide, or DMF. The national Centers forDisease Control said Thursday that while tannery workers exposed tothe solvent are at ``elevated risk,'' DMF cannot currently be shownas a ``definitive'' cause, and the exact risks require furtherevaluation.   DMF is also used in the aircraft industry. The National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health believes that about 94,000 U.S.workers are potentially exposed to the solvent.   Three cases of testicular cancer were diagnosed in workers at aleather tannery in upstate New York's Fulton County between 1982 and1984, triggering a state and federal investigation. The tannery hadused DMF to help dyes seep into the leather being processed there.   Three such cases among 80 workers on the plant's finishing linebetween 1975-87 is 41 times greater than would be expectedstatistically, which ``indicates an elevated risk for testicularcancer among finishing line workers,'' the CDC said.   Further, a survey of medical records found seven additional casesof testicular cancer in Fulton County males aged 20-54 between 1974and 1987. ``Five of the 10 case-patients ... had been employed inleather-related occupations,'' the CDC said in its report Thursday,prepared with NIOSH.   Two of those five patients were from tanneries other than theoriginal investigation site, Calvert said.   The CDC report noted that the tannery, identified in news reportsas the Pan American tannery of Gloversville, had withdrawn its DMFdyes and replaced them with other materials, and other nearbyfacilities have done the same or are considering it.</TEXT></DOC>
