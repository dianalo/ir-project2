The Karen guerrillas raided perimeter outposts on Sept. 26, thensent reinforcements to attack government troops at Methawaw, on thewestern bank of the Moei River, said the spokesman, Kyaw Sann.   More than 150 rounds from mortars and recoiless rifles, firedfrom the Thai side of the river, crashed into Methawaw on Sunday,he told reporters. Shells fired by the guerrillas inside Burma alsostruck Thai territory, he said.   The area is about 130 miles northeast of Rangoon.   The fighting occurred less than a month after military commanderGen. Saw Maung seized power from a civilian government and brutallysuppressed widespread anti-government protests led by students andBuddhist months.   Kyaw Sann, who gave no casualty figures, said the fightingcontinued today ``in the second biggest engagement'' since Sept. 30when government forces drove back 2,000 guerrillas of the BurmaCommunist Party from Mong Yang in the east. The guerrillas hadattacked the government outpost Sept. 23.   The government had said more than 200 communist guerrillas and47 soldiers, including five officers, were killed in that fighting.   ``In the northeast, near Mongko and Kyukok areas, we noticed theBurma Communist Party massing troops recently,'' Kyaw Sann said.``We are also preparing for any assault from them.''   The Karens, an ethnic-based group, and the communists are thecountry's two most powerful insurgencies. They have been fightingthe government for decades, the Karens seeking greater autonomy fortheir areas.   Kyaw Sann also acknowledged that more than 3,000 students hadjoined the rebel groups since Saw Maung seized power in RangoonSept. 18. He said some of the students were receiving militarytraining.   Officials of three rebel groups told reporters in Thailand onSunday that 4,000 students and other civilians had joined theirranks.   Students were at the forefront of pro-democracy demonstrationsin Rangoon, but they were driven underground by Saw Maung's troops,who have killed at least 440 people since the takeover.   Kyaw Sann said 2,000 of the students had joined the Karens and500 joined the communists while the rest joined five other rebelgroups.   The Karens are among a dozen major ethnic minority groups inBurma, a country of 38 million people. the Karens, who live largelyalong the Thai-Burmese border and in the Irrawaddy Delta, number 2million. During the colonial period large numbers were converted toChristianity by american and other missionaries and enjoyedrelative freedom under the British rule.   Feeling that the promise of autonomy within a federal systemafter independence had been broken, a number of Karens fled tojungle areas along the Thai-Burmese border and in 1949 rose up inrebellion, managing to fight their way to the gates of Rangoonbefore being pushed back to their sanctuaries.   Karen leader Gen. Bo Mya said recently that his insurgent group,called the Karen National Union, fields 17,000 troops.</TEXT></DOC>
