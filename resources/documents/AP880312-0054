I'mterrified now _ I shall never go near a ballroom again,'' said thejudge, Sir Leslie Boreham, 70, as he threw the case out Thursday.   Dance teacher Edith Spry, 72, had sought damages from70-year-old Jack Plowright. She testified during a five-hourhearing that she asked Plowright for a dance during a 1981 vacationon the Spanish island of Majorca.   Mrs. Spry said Plowright ``whirled me round like I had neverbeen whirled round before,'' leaving her breathless, bruised andflat on her back on the dance floor.   ``He was dancing at a terrific speed. I was quite frightened. ... But before I could say anything I was on the floor,'' Mrs. Sprytestified.   Mrs. Spry sued Plowright for unspecified damages, claiming hekicked her left leg and caused an ulcer when he fell on her. Sheblamed his fast-paced dancing on incorrect footwear _ plasticsandals.   Plowright denied dancing boisterously and said he overbalancedwhen his feet stopped during a turn. He said the floor was uneven.   The judge decided that Plowright did not dance with recklessabandon and dismissed the case.</TEXT></DOC>
