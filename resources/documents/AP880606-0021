Pendleton, chairman of the U.S.Civil Rights Commission and one of the highest-ranking blackofficials in government, died Sunday after collapsing whileexercising, officials said. He was 57.   Pendleton died about 11 a.m. at Mission Bay Hospital afterefforts failed to revive him, said deputy coroner David Lodge.Pendleton was believed to have suffered a heart attack, Lodge said.   President Reagan selected Pendleton, an opponent of affirmativeaction quotas and busing, to head the commission in November 1981after firing Arthur S. Flemming. Flemming, the chairman since 1974,criticized Reagan's civil rights policies as ``in conflict with theConstitution.''   The bipartisan Civil Rights Commission monitors the enforcementof civil rights laws within the federal government. It lackspolicy-making or enforcement powers and serves only as an advisorybody.   A White House spokesman, Bill Harlow, said he was aware thatPendleton had died, but said the White House wouldn't have anycomment until the morning.   ``He's going to be missed,'' Civil Rights Commission memberRobert A. Destro said. ``I don't think it's going to make anydifference whether people agreed with him or disagreed with him. Hewas a great human being .... He was a very dynamic person.''   Democratic presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said Pendleton``was an outstanding public servant and, like any American, he hadthe right to express his point of view, which may not have been amainstream point of view.''   Pendleton stirred wrath by calling liberal black leaders ``thenew racists'' whose support for the Democratic Party ``led blacksinto a political Jonestown.'' He described the concept of comparableworth as ``the looniest idea since `Looney Tunes''' and said that``relieving one's poverty is not civil rights.''   He criticized the Civil Rights Restoration Act, passed earlierthis year over President Reagan's veto, as ``an unwarranted invasion... by Big Brother.''   He also called affirmative actions ``divisive, unpopular andimmoral'' and opposed federal set-aside contracts for minority-ownedbusinesses.   Pendleton often was at odds with other commission members. Thecommission voted 5-1 in 1982 to state that there had beenretrenchment and retreat in all areas of civil rights enforcement.Pendleton was the lone dissenter.   In June 1982, Pendleton argued there was little Reagan or anypresident could do for urban areas until the economy and Americanproductivity improved.   ``I believe in the trickle down theory because it (prosperity)doesn't trickle up,'' he said.   Pendleton maintained that black citizens must make it on themerits of their own abilities without any special preference orapologies from the government or the white power structure.   He made a practice of giving so-called ``Uncivil Rights'' awardsto those whose actions furthered discrimination as he defined it.The most recent went to Chicago Mayor Eugene Sawyer last month fordelaying the firing of an aide who made anti-Semitic remarks.   Pendleton lived in the affluent community of La Jolla, about 10miles north of downtown San Diego, with his second wife, Margrit,and their young daughter.   He commuted to Washington, D.C., and also frequently gavespeeches around the country.   Pendleton battled high blood pressure for years, Police ChiefBill Kolender said after talking to Mrs. Pendleton, whom hedescribed as ``distraught, upset, obviously.''   Pendleton was alone at the Hilton Beach and Tennis Resort, ridinga stationary cycle when he collapsed about 10 a.m., said GaryLingley, director of the hotel's tennis club. Pendleton, a San Diegoresident, was a member of the health club, Lingley said.   ``Two members heard a small noise, a scream maybe, we don't knowwhat it was,'' Lingley said. ``About a minute later, when theywalked into the health club they saw him lying face down by theExercycles. He had fallen unconscious.''   Lingley said the club members called for help and he arrived atthe scene in about 15 seconds and began giving Pendletoncardiopulmonary resuscitation. A doctor who was a hotel guestassisted until the paramedics arrived, he said.   An avid jogger and swimmer, he once taught physical education atthe college level and worked as a government recreation director inWashington and Baltimore being named director of the Model CitiesDepartment in San Diego in 1972. He was president of the UrbanLeague in San Diego from 1975 until 1982.   Pendleton graduated from Howard University in Washington, D.C.,in 1954 and after serving in the Army he returned to earn a masters'degree in education.   Pendleton was married Oct. 10, 1970 to Margrit Krause, accordingto the Federal Staff Directory. Their three children were listed asGeorge Wallace, Susan Adele and Paula Denise.</TEXT></DOC>
