But it is North Korea's worsening economy, rather thanmembership in the world body, that is likely to force thenation out of its self-imposed isolation and away from itsrigid command economy. Pyongyang needs food and oil and thehard currency to buy them. The Soviet Union can no longerprovide goods at concessionary prices or on credit. Nor canChina, its other main ally, offer much help.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;All of this makes it impossible for North Korea to resistthe trend toward fundamental reforms and the opening of itseconomy in the long term,&quot; says Young Soo Gil, an economistat the Seoul-sponsored Korea Development Institute.   Some analysts believe that new economic contacts will pushNorth Korea's domestic economy to become more market driven.They expect North Korea to relax its heavily centralizedauthority and restructure its industry to concentrate less onmilitary equipment and more on consumer goods. After a recentvisit to North Korea, Robert Scalapino, a professor at theUniversity of California at Berkeley, told an audience inSeoul that Pyongyang's leadership wants change.   But other analysts discount the possibility of any rapidevolution. They note, for example, that China has beenopening its economy while still maintaining a repressivepolitical regime. &quot;My suspicion is that reform has still along way to go,&quot; says Lee Tong Bok, a special assistant tothe South Korean prime minister on unification issues.   South Korea's President Roh Tae Woo is nonethelessconfident that the two Koreas will, before the end of thedecade, trade freely and allow unfettered communication andtravel, although he believes political unification is fartheroff. South Korean officials say they have little interest inabsorbing North Korea, as West Germany did East Germany. Theyestimate the cost would be more than $18 billion, much morethan South Korea can afford.   Reliable statistics for the hermit nation are hard to comeby, but South Korean government analysts say that NorthKorea, with a population of under 22 million, has a grossnational product of about $23 billion, a tenth the size ofSouth Korea's economy. The National Unification Board inSeoul says North Korea's economy contracted 3.7% last yearand that a severe recession is continuing. Food is in shortsupply, defectors report, and the country has apparentlytightened rations. Pyongyang is pushing a &quot;Two Meals a Day,&quot;campaign, and officials in Seoul have heard reports from theNorth of food riots in which shots were fired.   Moreover, reduced oil supplies from the Soviet Unionreportedly have resulted in power shortages that haverestricted North Korean factories to operating at less thanhalf capacity. With foreign debt of about $8 billion, or 35%of annual GNP, the country is unlikely to be able to borrowmore overseas. The last time it did so, it defaulted. AndNorth Korea has no hard currency reserves to buy goods, asituation made worse by the Soviets' recent demand thatpayment for its products be made in hard currency rather thanon credit. The Soviet Union is responsible for about half ofNorth Korea's trade.   North Korea's desperation may mean opportunity for therest of the world. The nation has a low-wage work force nearthe major consumer markets of Japan and South Korea. Manyexpect Japan to be first through the door. Small Japanesecompanies already have formed about 40 joint ventures inNorth Korea, most of them making clothes for sale in Japan.   Japan already is preparing to recognize North Korea.Pyongyang hopes that along with diplomatic relations willcome $5 billion in aid. When Japan normalized relations withSouth Korea in 1985, it gave Seoul $300 million in&quot;reparations&quot; for the colonial period and World War II and anadditional $200 million in commercial loans.   South Korean businesses are eager to expand economicrelations too. For several years the Hyundai Group has talkedof developing a resort in North Korea's Kumgang mountainrange. And the Kolon Group recently proposed selling a sockfactory to North Korea, which would repay Kolon with thefinished goods. But neither deal has worked out so far,apparently because Pyongyang remains shy about direct tradewith the South.   Moreover, North Korea's hostility toward the South remainsintense. In August, North Korean troops directed small-armsfire at the demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.North Korea has one million soldiers, most of them near theborder, arrayed against South Korea's 600,000 troops, who aresupported by about 40,000 U.S. troops.   Still, economic necessity may eventually force North Koreato rely on the South as its main economic partner. &quot;SouthKorea is willing to engage in economic exchanges with NorthKorea even at concessionary terms,&quot; says Mr. Young of KoreaDevelopment Institute.</TEXT></DOC>
