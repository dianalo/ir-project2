Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,said the agreement ``features an unprecedented breakthrough inlabor-management relations with respect to family care.''   Bahr was also speaking on behalf of the InternationalBrotherhood of Electrical Workers, the second union covered by theagreement.   Both sides agreed to extend the talks beyond the midnightSaturday deadline. The contract must now be ratified by the union'srank and file.   Among concessions were an agreement by the unions to amendseveral job classifications in ATandamp;T's favor, and to forgocost-of-living adjustments. The company agreed to limits on the useof temporary workers.   Highlights of the agreement include:   _Six months parental leave after the birth of a child, withemployment and seniority guaranteed and all medical insurance paidby the company. Those same leave and benefit provisions would coverworkers who take time off to care for a sick parent.   _A $5 million child-care fund, jointly administered by thecompany and unions, to support new and existing child care centersin regions of the country where union members report difficultyobtaining services.   _Up to $2,000 from ATandamp;T to workers to help cover the costs ofadoption.   The contracts also contain a 12 percent benefits increase fornew pensioners, a 5 percent increase in payments for existingpensions effective Jan. 1, 1991, and a new system to assist workersseeking transfers or looking for work elsewhere in the company whenexisting jobs are eliminated.   Union workers also for the first time will share in ATandamp;T'sannual profits, receiving 2.5 percent a year. The unions said thatamount would average $700 per person a year based on ATandamp;T's 1988performance.   Also, ATandamp;T joined with the unions in forming a committee thatwill lobby for legislative and policy changes designed to curbsoaring health care costs.   The health plan premiums remain fully paid by the company andthe plan retains 100 percent coverage for most services.   However, the agreement does make it more likely that moreworkers will reach the existing $150 annual deductible by exemptingmore medical services from so-called ``first dollar'' coverage.   And the agreement provides that workers will have to pay higherdeductibles and fees if they choose a physician who charges morethan those on a list of ``preferred providers'' who agree to a feestructure negotiated with the company.   The contracts are the result of the largest single-employercollective bargaining this year. They likely will have asignificant impact on contract talks this summer with the so-called``baby bells'' formed after the 1984 ATandamp;T breakup and otherregional phone companies. In all, 500,000 union workers areaffected by those contracts.   The national agreement provides operations employees _ primarilyoperators, technicians, clerical and administrative staff _ animmediate 4 percent pay increase, an additional 2.5 percent in thesecond year of the contract and 2.25 percent in the final year.   Manufacturing workers would receive an 8 percent lump sumpayment after ratification and those in skilled trades would get anadditional 50-cents-an-hour. All manufacturing workers wouldreceive base wage increases of 3.5 percent in the second year ofthe contract and 3 percent in the third.   Members of the CWA, who make up more than 75 percent of the ATandamp;Tworkers from the two unions, currently receive a weekly base payranging from $230 to $589.   It was the first time CWA and IBEW negotiated jointly, anagreement reached two years after a bitter dispute between theunions sparked by IBEW's decision not to honor a 26-day CWA strikein 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
