STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Czechoslovakia and the SovietUnion agreed Wednesday to begin reviewing the presence of 80,000Soviet troops stationed here since the ``Prague Spring'' reformswere crushed in 1968.   Foreign Minister Jiri Dienstbier and Premier Marian Calfa toldreporters after returning from a one-day visit to Moscow that ajoint commission will be set up in the first half of January.   The commission, composed of civilian and military experts, alsowill re-examine the political and historical events that led up tothe Soviet invasion and its consequences, Dienstbier said at anairport news conference.   Dienstbier, who has said he hopes an agreement can be reachedsoon on the withdrawal of Soviet troops, told reporters thecommission would ``deal with all aspects of the Soviet militarypresence'' in Czechoslovakia.   Calfa was asked if there would soon be a timetable for a pulloutof the troops, which have been stationed in Czechoslovakia on a``temporary'' basis for 21 years.   ``I don't know, but I think we will have results in this areathat will satisfy the nation,'' Calfa replied without elaboration.   In Moscow, the official news agency Tass announced that theSoviet Union had agreed to negotiate its troop presence inCzechoslovakia. Tass said Dienstbier and his Soviet counterpart,Eduard A. Shevardnadze, agreed to begin the talks in the first twoweeks of next month.   The dispatch did not say the Soviet Union would be negotiatingwithdrawal of its troops, but the Czechoslovak state news agencyCTK has said the East bloc country would begin preliminarynegotiations for the pullout of Soviet troops.   Dienstbier said he met with Shevardnadze for more than an hourWednesday. Calfa met with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev andPremier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov.   Calfa said he left Moscow with the feeling that there was``great understanding for this question.''   Alexander Dubcek, who led the Prague Spring movement crushed bythe Soviet-led Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968, signed theinitial document allowing the troops' presence after tensenegotiations in the Kremlin, where he was flown right after theinvasion.   Since the ouster of hard-line communist leaders the last month,the new Czechoslovak leadership has said the agreement was invalidbecause it was signed under duress.   On Wednesday, the Communist Party apologized for its hard-linepolicies of the past and for abusing its opponents after the 1968crackdown.   Earlier this month, the Soviet Union condemned the invasion as amistake. Under Gorbachev, the Kremlin has vowed not to interfere inthe affairs of its Warsaw Pact allies.   Poland, East Germany, Hungary and Bulgaria also have apologizedfor their roles in the invasion.   Dienstbier sai before the visit that any troop withdrawals mustrun parallel with East-West talks on conventional weaponsreductions under way in Vienna, where a preliminary accord isexpected next year.   Faced with a peaceful revolution, Czechoslovakia's hard-linePresident Gustav Husak resigned Dec. 10 after swearing in the newgovernment dominated by non-communists. Other hard-line leadersassociated with the crackdown that followed the invasion have beenousted from power and purged from the party.</TEXT></DOC>
