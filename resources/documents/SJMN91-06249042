AB 101 simply recognizes this fact, and assures us thathiring and renting decisions will be made in a fair and unbiased manner.;   --Bradley C. Zaller; Cupertino; GIVE REAGAN, BUSH CREDIT WHERE IT'S DUE; Manypeople will not want to see a direct relationship between Ronald Reagan's andGeorge Bush's presidential leadership and the collapse of communism in theSoviet Union. Even supporters of presidential policies since 1980 weresurprised by the swiftness of changes occurring.;   But, or perhaps because, aset objective has been realized we will now see many ingenious attempts todeny cause and effect. Maybe we should attribute the changes to the prayers ofthe faithful over these many years for the &quot;conversion&quot; of Russia.;   GeorgeBush has been, and will continue to be, criticized for being a foreign policypresident, unmindful of national needs. Yes, we have plenty of problems withinthe United States, but the physical security of people around the world is afirst priority, and from that will flow the internal and external benefits ofan internationalized economic system, forming a basis for worldwide peace andharmony.;   And what is all this talk about now having to provide tax-basedeconomic aid to the Soviet Union? Forget it. Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-NewYork, suggested the solution: Give the Soviet Republics ourmost-favored-nation trade status, unleash our free market entrepreneurs, andwatch for the happy results.;   -- Joseph D. Cusick; Los Gatos; AUTHOR OFDATE-RAPE LETTER MAY CLAM UP; I noted the replies by various women to Sam A.Miriam III's letter concerning date rape, particularly &quot;Little boy-men . . . &quot;(Letters, Aug. 27). Do you think Miriam will ever be honest about what goes onin his mind again after getting bashed over the head by those judgmental anddefensive feminists? No wonder American men (especially white, middle-class)are signing up for all these &quot;wild man weekends.&quot; Maybe it does make sense togo to the woods and blast out your frustrations for not being able tocommunicate.;   -- Robert B. Luthi; San Jose; 'TRASH' THAT NEVER; REACHES THELANDFILL; Sooner or later we'll recognize that recyclable material is not&quot;trash,&quot; as you referred to it in your informative chart (Science andamp; Medicinesection, Aug. 27). What's more, there are many items other than the paper,glass, plastic, cans and oil which are currently recycled which can be reusedrather than dumped in a landfill.;   According to your statistics, San Josefamilies recycle 3,000 tons a month of the above-named materials. That numberdoes not reflect the immense amount of other material donated to non-profitreuse organizations such as the Salvation Army. At our current collectionrates, the San Jose Adult Rehabilitation Center diverts almost 1.5 millionpounds a month of clothing, furniture, appliances and other items from thelandfill waste stream.;   Your chart answered the question, &quot;what happens toall that stuff?&quot; At the Salvation Army, material offered in our Thrift Storesgoes to people looking for bargains and those who may not otherwise be able toafford some of life's necessities.;   -- Ken Kelly; Director of Development;San Jose Adult Rehabilitation Center; The Salvation Army  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910905  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  623  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, September 5, 199100249042,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
