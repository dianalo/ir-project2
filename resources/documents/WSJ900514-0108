Smith and othertop executives is drawing fire from some big shareholders,with at least one vowing to vote no on the proposal.   Michigan's state treasurer, Robert Bowman, usually asupporter of GM management, said Saturday he will vote thestate's 8.8 million GM shares against the plan, which wouldincrease Mr. Smith's annual retirement pay to $1.2 million.Mr. Smith is scheduled to retire Aug. 1.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We don't think this is the best use of $42 million,&quot; Mr.Bowman said, referring to the estimated $41.6 million totalcost of the pension increases for 3,350 senior GM executives,including Mr. Smith.   A GM spokesman said yesterday it wouldn't be appropriateto comment on Mr. Bowman's voting plans. &quot;Shareholder votingis up to each individual,&quot; he said.   Mr. Bowman's decision, however, hardly dooms the pensionproposal. Michigan is one of the three biggest GM holders,but it casts only 1.5% of the total 602 million-share commonstock vote.   Further, the company's argument that its executivepensions rank in the bottom 21% of major industrial companiesis winning support from other big shareholders.   &quot;At a time when the insurance industry is teetering onjunk bonds and the banking system is in disarray. . . . hereis a company that's piled up $10 billion in cash and is afinancial powerhouse,&quot; said an official with one largeinstitutional GM stockholder. This official, who requestedanonymity, added: &quot;If they want to give themselves betterpensions, they probably deserve it.&quot;   GM also got a boost from Institutional ShareholderServices, Inc., a consulting firm that advises many largeinstitutional investors on how to vote on proxy issues. Theproposal &quot;would serve the purpose of bringing General Motors'pension benefits up to a par with those of its competitors,&quot;said Andrew Smith, a senior analyst with the firm, in astatement Friday.   Still, the executive pension issue is shaping up to be anunusually divisive one as GM prepares for its annualshareholders meeting on May 25. In recent years, GM'smanagement has had strong support from institutionalinvestors, who like the company's hefty $3-a-share dividend.   But several major fund managers said late last week thatthey may break with management over the size and timing ofthe proposed executive pension increases.   &quot;We're a little surprised and concerned,&quot; said RichardKoppes, general counsel for the California state retirementsystem. Although state pension officials haven't officiallydecided how to cast their proxy ballots, &quot;we're leaningtoward voting against it,&quot; he said. Earlier this year,California officials wrote an unusual letter to GM directorsexpressing concern about GM's loss of market share in theU.S.   Roland MacHold, the director of New Jersey's state pensionfund, called the proposed pension increases &quot;ill-timed.&quot;While Mr. MacHold said he isn't sure how his fund will vote,he added: &quot;I'm disappointed they'd do this just in advance ofintense labor negotiations {this fall}.&quot;   The company's proposal has infuriated leaders of theUnited Auto Workers union. That's because the proposalundermined the union leadership's effort to blunt arank-and-file drive to make cost-of-living raises forblue-collar pensioners a top demand in bargaining with theBig Three auto makers this fall. Union leaders share the viewof company officials that putting UAW pensions on acost-of-living escalator would cost billions, hurt Detroit'scompetitiveness, and deplete resources that might otherwisego to higher wages and improved job protections.   Another controversial aspect of the timing is that theincreases are retroactive to Nov. 1, 1989. GM contends itneeds sweeter executive pensions &quot;to improve competitiveness&quot;and attract top managerial talent. But critics contend thatboosting the pay of those already retired, or about to, won'tcontribute to that goal.   The fact that the oft-controversial Mr. Smith will be oneof the first beneficiaries also is spurring some criticism.&quot;I don't think Roger Smith is employable anywhere except themovies,&quot; snapped Mr. MacHold, alluding to a recent movie thatposed Mr. Smith as the villain behind the decline of Flint,Mich.   The new pension formula outlined in GM's proxy statementis more lucrative because it includes executive bonuses incalculating the retirement benefit. Previously, GM pensionswere based solely on salary. But straight salary can be lessthan 50% of a GM executive's total direct compensation.   GM's board could proceed with its plan even in theunlikely event that a majority of shareholders vote againstit. But the company has assured shareholders that it willabide by their wishes.   &quot;I give GM credit for putting it before the shareholdersbefore the labor negotiations,&quot; Mr. Bowman said. Otherwise,he added, &quot;it would have looked like they were trying tohoodwink people.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
