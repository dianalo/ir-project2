The Cupertino, Calif., firm is so concerned about sky-high demand for the machine that it fears its sole outside supplier of the laptop's screens may wilt under the onslaught of orders.    At Businessland Inc., the big personal-computer retailer, store managers can't get their hands on enough of Apple's Macintosh and International Business Machines Corp.'s PS/2 computers equipped with new communications software. Novell Inc. and 3Com Corp., the biggest makers of networking software that links PCs, both expect big sales gains in the next 12 months. And Compaq Computer Corp. is selling so many advanced machines that one of its main suppliers, disk-drive maker Conner Peripherals Inc., said yesterday its second-quarter sales more than tripled to $164 million.    This is a slump?    The personal computer industry is, indeed, slowing down, to an estimated overall growth rate of 10% or so from nearly twice that a year ago. But the trend disguises a central fact about the PC business -- rather than slumping broadly, it is increasingly divided between winners and losers. The makers of the most advanced machines, and the software companies that specialize in linking them, are still going strong, while hardware and software concerns with older products are experiencing such sharp drops in sales that many are reporting losses. One problem for the winners is that investors aren't distinguishing them from the losers, as most PC-related stocks have taken a beating in the past several months.    In part, the widening gulf between winners and losers reflects the growing strength of three industry powerhouses. This year, Compaq and Apple have cemented their status -- along with IBM -- as the dominant hardware suppliers in the industry. IBM, which doesn't break out its PC results, said in June that its sales of those machines were growing at an annual rate of 40%, faster than expected.    &quot;Before, the three were leaders,&quot; says Charles R. Wolf, an analyst at First Boston Corp. in New York. &quot;Today, they are dominant and are building a widening lead over the second tier.&quot;    Mr. Wolf believes that this year and next, these three firms will account for virtually all of the growth in PC sales world-wide, leaving a bevy of smaller competitors to fight over a stagnant market. He estimates that personal-computer sales by Apple, Compaq and IBM will grow a combined 25% this year and 20% in 1990. &quot;I have the rest of the market being flat,&quot; Mr. Wolf says.    The gap between winners and losers also is seen in software, where Microsoft Corp. is increasingly dominant. On Tuesday, the company said it expects sales in its current fiscal year, which began July 1, to rise 25% to $1 billion.    The software industry remains populated by scores of companies, but few have forged a broad, effective strategy. Companies which rely heavily on single products, such as Lotus Development Corp. with its 1-2-3 spreadsheet, Ashton-Tate Corp. with its data-base management program and Aldus Corp. with its Pagemaker publishing program, have seen their stars dim. Companies with broader offerings, meanwhile, are gaining appeal, partly because &quot;customers think it's more important to integrate applications,&quot; says John Zeisler, vice president of marketing at Claris Corp., a software company owned by Apple.    Software companies also are suffering from trying to adapt existing programs to new operating systems. &quot;The biggest growth area is moving existing products to these new platforms,&quot; says Gordon Eubanks, chief executive officer of Symantec Corp., a Cupertino, Calif., software maker.    Chasing these opportunities, however, has exhausted scarce programming resources, and -- what's worse -- hasn't paid off yet. Many software companies have adapted popular programs to Microsoft's OS/2 operating system, but customers have been slow to buy OS/2. Microsoft still estimates that it will sell one million copies of OS/2 in 1990, but others aren't so sure. &quot;I haven't seen a big push from anybody for OS/2,&quot; says Phillip E. White, chief executive officer at Informix Software Inc.    The time spent on OS/2 has had another adverse effect, diverting attention from customer problems. &quot;The basic problem is that for 18 months the industry has been talking to itself,&quot; says Stewart Alsop, editor of the PC Letter, a newsletter. &quot;That's confused the customer, who's decided to hold off on purchases.&quot;    The problem in hardware is different: customers know what they want, but seemingly can't get enough. For large corporate buyers, speed and power are the most wanted features.    That has resulted in a split in the hardware market between makers of low-powered and high-powered computers. Sales of machines using Intel Corp.'s fast 80386 microprocessor are growing more than 30% annually, while sales of machines using less powerful microprocessors are eroding, says Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter.    &quot;The trend toward higher-performance systems is clear,&quot; says Safi Qureshey, chief executive officer of AST Research Inc., Irvine, Calif., which makes personal computers and related products. &quot;Companies that are focusing on this are doing reasonably well.&quot;    Mr. Qureshey says AST has withdrawn from several peripheral businesses to concentrate on supplying more powerful personal computers, including a new machine using Intel's 80486 microprocessor, that company's newest and most powerful.    Both IBM and Compaq, which have strong 80386 offerings, are benefiting from the enthusiasm for higher-powered machines. Apple, which offers similarly powered machines using processors from Motorola Inc., also is benefiting.    Although the emphasis on powerful machines is driving PC sales, the trend worries some industry officials. These computers cost much more than lower-powered machines, so they mask slowing growth in unit sales. &quot;That scares me,&quot; says Claris's Mr. Zeisler. &quot;Are we trading higher dollars for fewer customers?&quot;    ---@ PC Winners and Losers @ Sales of selected personal-computer hardware and software companies for each company's latest fiscal year, in millions of dollars, and analysts' estimates for current fiscal years @ Leaders @ LATEST- CURRENT- @ YEAR YEAR PCT. @ SALES SALES CHG. @ Apple Computer 4,071 5,300 30% @ Compaq 2,066 3,000 45 @ Microsoft 804 1,000 24 @ Novell 347 445 28 @ Connor Peripherals 247 640 159 @ Laggards @ LATEST- CURRENT- @ YEAR YEAR PCT. @ SALES SALES CHG. @ Wyse Technology 452 505 12% @ AST Research 457 520 14 @ Ashton-Tate 307 360 17 @ Aldus 79 90 14 @ Seagate 1,370 1,570 15 </TEXT></DOC>
