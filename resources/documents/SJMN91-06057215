Fact is, they've bent a rule or two, like the oneprohibiting superiors from fraternizing with subordinate soldiers. They'replanning to marry when they return to the United States.;    But all's fair,as they say. Some rules seem irrelevant and even cruel when men and women arerisking their lives in war.;    &quot;I think it's good for morale,&quot; a superiorofficer said to his driver regarding the handful of love affairs that havestarted at the 937th, where 14 women are based as clerks, cooks and in othercapacities.;    Overstreet and Barnett met in October back at Fort Riley,Kan., where she processed him into the unit.;    Their mutual attraction wasimmediate if somewhat shy.;    Overstreet found herself staring at Barnett ashe loaded equipment and supplies onto pallets for shipment to Saudi Arabia.;   &quot;I don't know what it was that appealed to me,&quot; said Overstreet, 34, who wasborn in Idar-Oberstein, Germany, and came to America with her then-husband, anAmerican soldier she met in Germany. &quot;His eyes, I think. They look so sad mostof the time.&quot;;    Barnett, for his part, kept returning to Overstreet to askher for military-issue items, even those she had issued to him two days in arow before that.;    &quot;Is something wrong with you?&quot; she asked him, notrealizing her attraction to him was reciprocated. &quot;You need a lot of femalesupervision.&quot;;    On the flight to Saudi Arabia, seeing her pale with fear offlying, he said, &quot;Sergeant, you need some male supervision.&quot;;    When theyarrived in Saudi Arabia late the night of Oct. 27, they were standing on anairfield tarmac and made eye contact.;    The serious kind.;    As thesethings go, one thing led to another. But because they are in the military,there were obstacles to the course of true love.;    They ate their mealstogether until a superior &quot;advised&quot; them to eat alone.;    They went on tripstogether to procure supplies until another supervisor arranged their schedulesso it was no longer possible.;    And they found private time together onlywhen he visited the tent she shares with 13 other women, where male visitorsmust be out by 10 p.m.;    &quot;We've got to be kind of discreet, because she kindof outranks me,&quot; said Barnett, 22, of Aurora, Colo. &quot;So we can't do things,like hold hands, that we could in civilian life.&quot;;    Indeed, under armyregulations, Overstreet technically could face disciplinary action resultingin loss of pay or court martial. But with a ground war in progress, no oneseems to mind as long as they remain discreet.;    &quot;If I hugged and kissed himin public,&quot; said Overstreet, &quot;I'd be given a Field Grade Article 15. They'dmake me an E5. If we were at Fort Riley, I'd be busted, or at least counseledin writing.&quot;;    Like everyone else in the theater, they long for the simpledomestic pleasures that spell home.;    &quot;Valentine's Day, I couldn't find acard, a box of candy, flowers, nothing,&quot; said Barnett. &quot;The only thing on themarket is heaters, wicks and stuff like that. So I went around all day longsaying Happy Valentine's Day to her.&quot;;    Overstreet wishes she could cook forher man, &quot;instead of having the mess hall make our decisions.&quot;;    But findinglove has been a great comfort, they said.;    &quot;It helps to find someone I canbe comfortable with,&quot; said Barnett. &quot;I'm tired of all this male-bonding stuff.It's nice to have a female to love.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROL MORELLO, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  In Northern Saudi Arabia  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910226  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  14A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  701  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 26, 199100057215,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
