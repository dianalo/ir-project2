WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Authorities have cleared the way for criminalcharges to be filed against ousted leader Erich Honecker and otherdisgraced officials of the past Communist Party leadership, EastGerman officials announced today.   A security cordon also was erected around the lavish compoundwhere Honecker and other party figures suspected of wrongdoing liveto prevent them from taking state property, the official ADN newsagency reported.   Hartmut Boecker, head of the local governing council for theNeubrandenburg area where the party officials live, said he orderedthe area sealed off and stripped the former leaders of theirimmunity from criminal charges.   Boecker said the declaration clears the way for criminalproceedings against Honecker, former Premier Willi Stoph and others.   There was no immediate indication of what charges might be filedor when.   The actions coincide with other efforts by party chief EgonKrenz to distance his new, reform-minded leadership from thereported abuses of power committed by Honecker and his colleagues.   On Wednesday, East German newspapers disclosed that Stoph hadtaken valuables from his opulent estate after Communist Partyofficials began investigating allegations of wrongdoing by formerparty figures. The reports said Stoph had turned a park into aprivate estate that included several homes and an indoor swimmingpool.   Krenz and Communist Premier Hans Modrow signed a petitioncirculated by activists who are calling for East Germany to remainsocialist.   Keeping a socialist framework could help the Communists maintainthe power they have wielded without contest for 40 years.   Krenz, 52, who has been in office only six weeks, faces a strongchallenge from reform activists he will meet with Wednesday, aswell as from the Communist Party hierarchy that will attend aspecial congress on Dec. 15-17.   His ability to remain party leader will depend largely on hissuccess in appeasing the opposition forces at Wednesday's talks.   The talks are the latest political development in East Germany,where the exodus of thousands of people and massive anti-governmentdemonstrations led to the ouster of Honecker on Oct. 18 and theopening of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9.   The party has agreed that Krenz and Modrow will debate thecourse of reform with delegates from allied political parties andfrom opposition groups.   Both sides agreed to let church officials moderate thediscussions at a Lutheran Church facility in East Berlin, theofficial ADN news agency reported Wednesday.   A main issue will be a proposal to strike the Communists'guaranteed monopoly on power from the state constitution, churchsources said.   Spokeswoman Angelika Barbe of the East German Social Democratssaid her recently formed party planned to call for measures to freepolitical prisoners and remove barriers remaining for the return ofthose who fled the past regime.   Nearly 300,000 East Germans have moved to West Germany thisyear, discouraged about prospects for speedy or thorough reform athome.   Opposition groups have pushed for the reform talks to covereconomic issues. A main concern is stopping further damage to theweak East German mark caused by black-market sales spurred bytravel to the West.   The petition signed by Krenz and Modrow was initiated by writerStefan Heym and other East German intellectuals concerned about thecountry's future. They want a national referendum on whether thecountry should remain socialist.   The Communist leadership, as well as many members of thepro-reform groups, oppose West German efforts to work towardreunification of the two Germanys.   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Tuesday laid out a10-point plan for building a confederation between the two states,aiming at reunification.   The Bonn government launched a diplomatic offensive to promotethe idea. Kohl telephoned President Bush and Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher flew to Britain and France to inform theallies of the plan.   Krenz has sought to use East German public sentiment againstreunification as a rallying call to win popular support for hisbeleaguered Communist Party.   ``We have the historic duty to preserve this country with itsanti-fascist ideals and traditions as a socialist alternativewithin German development,'' he told backers of the appeal, whowant a nationwide ``vote of confidence'' in socialism.   Echoing the words of the petition, Krenz promised that EastGermany will preserve ``peace and social justice, individualfreedom, freedom of travel for all and the preservation of theenvironment.''   The Communists, bowing to pressure from growing oppositionforces, have promised free elections. No date has been set.</TEXT></DOC>
