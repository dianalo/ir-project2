(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite its recent loss of influence, OPECwill become a more important source of the world's oil in the 1990s,its secretary general says.   In a speech to a group of U.S. oil producers, Subroto said Mondayhe thinks the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries willsatisfy up to half of the world's oil demand in the next five years,up from about 40 percent today.   ``In OPEC, we see the projected increase in our market share asleading to the restoration of the influence which is our due,''Subroto said.   Conversely, he said, he expects oil production in non-OPECcountries to fall by about 1 million barrels per day from presentlevels during the first half of the 1990s.   Subroto said no major oil discoveries have been made in non-OPECareas and production could drop even more with accidents due toaging production facilities in the North Sea.   ``With about 84 percent of the world's total reserves, our membercountries are well placed to support the expansion in world oildemand projected for the early 1990s,'' he said.   He added that the 13 OPEC nations are striving for a stable oilmarket and he foresees no drastic price hikes over the next fiveyears.   Subroto predicted ``only moderate increases in real oil prices''over the period, but said OPEC's future market behavior will dependon a variety of factors, including cooperation from independent oilproducers.   He made his remarks to the U.S. Interstate Oil CompactCommission, which represents U.S. oil producers. The commission'ssemi-annual gathering will be held through Wednesday.   Its chairman is Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, who gave an overviewMonday of the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Prince William Sound and itscleanu-up efforts.   Cowper said the spill pointed out the need for more environmentalsafeguards but warned they would drive up oil production costs.</TEXT></DOC>
