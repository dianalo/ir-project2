Withthe aid of the second axiom of thermodynamics, the new representationfor f, depending in a local and nonlinear way on A/sup r/, is explicitlyderived. It is demonstrated that in ET of degree r an infinite sequence[b/sup r + 1/, b/sup r + 2/,...] of a higher order Hermite coefficients,which normally drops out of Grad's proposition for f fashioned by mathematicalapparatus such as the Hermite polynomials, cannot be considered negligiblein the case when nonlinear constitutive functions are established. UsingMa's kinetic equation corresponding to a one-dimensional rarefied gasas well as the generalized representation for f, collision productionsin the nonconservative moment equations are then calculated for a specialchoice of the rate of collisions between particles.</TEXT></DOC>
