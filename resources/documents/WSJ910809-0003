A potential rescue deal foundered after Gannett rebuffedan offer of $2.5 million, ending two months of negotiationwith editor and publisher Robert Maynard and his wife, deputypublisher Nancy Hicks Maynard, to buy back the note from theArlington, Va.-based media conglomerate.</LP><TEXT>   Failure to restructure the loan within the week will forcethe doors to close on the 117-year-old daily newspaper nextWednesday, putting 600 employees out of work, and leavingOakland as the nation's largest city without a dailynewspaper, the Tribune said.   &quot;We had an investor ready to help us buy the note at fairmarket value and put additional money into the company tocomplete a turnaround effort begun last year,&quot; Mr. Maynardsaid. &quot;But Gannett refused to accept our price, or give us arealistic price.&quot; He said Gannett insisted the note was worth$6 million to $8 million, yet failed to sell it on the openmarket.   In Arlington, Gannett denied receiving &quot;a bona fide offer&quot;from any investor. It said Mr. Maynard had declined toprovide Gannett with any details about the investor. &quot;Inlight of the fact that he owes us more than $31 million, wefelt we needed specifics to determine the merits of anyoffer,&quot; it added. However, Mr. Maynard said in an interviewthat the investor insisted on remaining anonymous.   Although the Tribune has been in default on its debtpayments for five years, Gannett said it has assured thenewspaper it won't take any action to trigger a bankruptcy.   In a letter to employees, Mr. Maynard said the investorwas willing to pay Gannett $2.5 million -- a fraction of thenote's value on the balance sheet but more than theliquidation value of the company. &quot;The mere fact that {thenote} sits on the Tribune's balance sheet at $31.5 millionand grows at $300,000 a month doesn't make it worth that onthe open market,&quot; he said.   He added the investor was the first in a string ofpotential white knights -- including pension funds,investment bankers and local private entrepreneurs -- whohadn't considered the debt to Gannett &quot;a deal killer.&quot;   The collapse of talks to repurchase the note is but thelatest disappointment in a five-year struggle to restructurethe liberal dream launched by a 1983 leveraged buy-out by theMaynards that made them, as they often liked to point out,the only black family in the country to own a dailynewspaper.   But intense media competition in the San Franciscomarketplace and depressed conditions in Oakland have taken atoll. Last year, the Tribune slashed expenses, andrenegotiated labor contracts with 13 unions to cut payrollcosts 25%. Abandoning its one-time ambition of becoming a BayArea daily, the Tribune retrenched and refocused its coverageon the urban East Bay core that is its home. That wasn'tenough.   &quot;This newspaper is in limbo, and cannot afford to remainin limbo for long,&quot; Mr. Maynard said.   Asked about the Tribune's chances of meeting its Wednesdaydeadline, he said in an interview the odds are &quot;not great.Not as good as 50-50.&quot;   Editorial employees were called to a meeting in thenewsroom and given the worst news so far delivered in theTribune's troubled recent past. Thanked in a letter for their&quot;heroic&quot; efforts to rescue the sinking newspaper, a fewemployees were in tears.   &quot;It never occurred to me,&quot; Mr. Maynard wrote employees,&quot;that it would be easier to gain agreement on saving theOakland Tribune with 13 trade unions than it would be withone media conglomerate.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
