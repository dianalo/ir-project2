The new notes' average yield of 8.18% was &quot;pretty much expected,&quot; Mr. Petri said, although there were more purchases from individuals than was anticipated.    Investor fear of rising inflation, a major influence in the bond market recently, also abated yesterday as prices of many commodities declined.    &quot;Bonds are in a weather market,&quot; said Richard L. Sandor, a senior vice president and head of the institutional financial futures division of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. &quot;When grains and beans go up, bonds tend to go down because of the relationship traders make between&quot; prices of agricultural commodities and inflation, Mr. Sandor said.    Worries about inflation still persist and there was some concern among traders that the Federal Reserve was signaling tighter credit as it drained reserves from the banking system yesterday.    Many analysts say the Fed intends to keep the rate on federal funds, or reserves banks lend each other overnight, between 7% and 7 1/8%. Yesterday the funds rate averaged 7.15%, estimated Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.). Tuesday's rate was 7.07%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    Despite the funds rate's rise and the Fed's so-called two-day matched sale-purchase agreement, analysts say these two events don't suggest the Fed has tightened credit. &quot;I find it difficult to read any policy significance into the action,&quot; said Kristin Foster, senior economist at Citicorp Investment Bank, echoing the comments of several money market analysts yesterday.    Nevertheless, the Fed's decision to arrange the unexpected two-day reserve drain shortly before a Treasury auction &quot;has to be viewed as suspicious,&quot; said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at First National Bank of Chicago.    He said the Fed's action may &quot;indicate a very subtle nudge&quot; beyond the upper end of the funds rate range to 7 1/4%. &quot;You definitely have to view this as a warning shot that the fund rate may trade up to 7 1/4%.&quot;    Corporate Issues   Corporate bond prices gained as much as half a point, though many issues were little changed.    In the high-yield market, Healthtrust Inc.'s four-part debt offering got under way with two deferred-interest bond issues and two conventional fixed-rate issues.    The highest-yielding portion is a $365 million redemption amount of zero-coupon debentures priced at 57.412 to yield 16.50% in 1991. Thereafter, the security begins to pay interest semiannually at a 16 1/2% coupon rate to maturity in 1999. The offering is being managed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    Robert Levine, a managing director in charge of the junk bond research department at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., said investors are becoming increasingly skittish toward new junk offerings &quot;because we're faced with rising interest rates and a large supply of new offerings in the month ahead. That's a one-two punch.&quot; Mr. Levine said investors &quot;should be particularly concerned&quot; because current junk bond yield spreads over Treasury bonds &quot;are at their lowest level since the stock market crash&quot; last October.    In the junk bond market yesterday, prices rose as much as 1/4 point in light trading. &quot;There isn't a lot of money moving into the market at this point,&quot; said Steven V. Anreder, a Drexel official.    Foreign Bonds   Short-term interest rates in France are poised to move lower, according to Pierre Beregovoy, the nation's economics minister. &quot;I hope to announce good news on this front soon,&quot; he said in a televised interview.    That was enough to spark a major bond market rally. The government's benchmark 9.8% issue due 1996 rose 1.15 points to 103.39 to yield 9.05% annually, and traders said futher gains are likely.    The next opportunity for an easing of credit is generally thought to be Tuesday, when the Bank of France is expected to add reserves to the banking system. This could allow the central bank to adjust its money market intervention rate, which is the leading indicator of changes in government credit policy.    The intervention rate has been steady at 7 1/4% since Jan. 25, when it was lowered 1/4 percentage point. Previous reductions in the rate have reflected a lower inflation rate and the strength of the French franc in the European monetary system.    A move to lower rates would follow yesterday's announcement by Prime Minister Michel Rocard that the new administration will maintain the former conservative government's commitment to cutting the budget deficit to 115 billion French francs by year end from 130 billion last year.    Japanese government bond prices rallied for the second consecutive day in brisk trading, increasing speculation the government may proceed with plans for a June issue of 10-year bonds.    Traders said banks, securities firms and some institutional investors steadily bid up prices yesterday. The market's sudden optimism the past two days contrasted with Monday's sharp sell-off. Some bankers said the Ministry of Finance now could reach an agreement with the government's bond underwriting syndicate to auction new securities today.    The coupon on a possible new offering could be between 4.8% and 4.9%, traders said. That compares with 4.6% on the No. 111 issues sold in April and May.    The benchmark 5% No. 105 bonds due 1997 rose 0.438 point to 102.476 by the close of interdealer trading in Tokyo. The simple yield eased to 4.625% semiannually from 4.69% Tuesday, according to Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. Over-the-counter trading volume in the No. 105 totaled 3 trillion yen, or about $24 billion. The No. 105's 3 p.m. close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange was 4.645%. The price was 102.35, up 0.31 point from Tuesday.    The September government bond futures contract settled at 105.46, up 0.38 point, while the June contract gained 0.34 point to 107.03. Volume in the September contract totaled 7.5 trillion yen, surpassing the 1.3 trillion yen in the June contract for the second consecutive session.    In the West German bond market, prices rose as much as 0.45 point. The government's 6 1/4% bonds due 1998 rose 0.25 point to 97.65 bid. The yield declined to 6.58% from 6.62%. British government issues were mostly unchanged. The benchmark 11 3/4% bonds due 2003/2007 closed at 118 22/32 to yield 9.37%, unchanged from Tuesday.    Treasury Securities   Prices of U.S. Treasury bonds and notes rose as much as 3/8 point, though many short-term issues were little changed.    The new bellwether 9 1/8% bonds due 2018 rose to 98 1/4 from 97 28/32 as the yield fell to 9.30% from 9.34% Tuesday. The government's 10-year notes rose to 98 27/32 from 98 19/32 as the yield declined to 9.18% from 9.21%. Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.'s index of long-term Treasury bonds rose 3.36 points to 1209.88. The index ranged between 1207.50 and 1211.59.    In the money market, rates on the Treasury's latest three-month and six-month bills rose slightly. The rate on the new three-month bill climbed to 6.32% bid from 6.30% bid Tuesday. The rate on the new six-month bill rose to 6.74% bid from 6.70% bid.    Here are details from yesterday's auction of Treasury two-year notes:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                          2-Year Notes    Applications ........................ $23,518,565,000    Accepted bids .........................$8,266,305,000    Accepted at low price ........................... 72%    Accepted noncompetitively ............ $1,330,000,000    Average price (Rate) .................. 99.900(8.18%)    High price (Rate) ..................... 99.955(8.15%)    Low price (Rate) ...................... 99.900(8.18%)    Interest rate ................................ 8 1/8%   The notes are dated May 31 and mature May 31, 1990.   Mortgage-Backed Securities   Ginnie Maes and other mortgage securities closed 1/8 to 1/4 point higher, helped by a $550 million Freddie Mac Remic. Sales of such repackaged mortgage bonds typically boosts prices.   First Boston Corp., underwriter of the Remic, a real estate mortgage investment conduit, said the eight-part Freddie Mac issue was mostly sold.   But mortgage securities still lagged behind the performance of Treasury bonds. Freddie Mac 10% bonds closed at 98 26/32-30/32, up 6/32. The bonds are yielding 10.19% to a 12-year average life assumption, 102 basis points above the 10-year Treasury note. June Ginnie Mae 9% bonds closed at 92 22/32-26/32. The bonds yield 10.23% to a 12-year average life assumption, 106 basis points above the 10-year note, one basis point wider than Tuesday.   Municipal Issues   Municipal bond prices gained as much as 3/8 point, buoyed by the gains in the government bond market.   In the secondary market, the closely tracked New Jersey Turnpike Authority 7.20% bonds due 2018 were quoted by some brokers at 88-88 1/4, up 3/8 from the closing bid Tuesday of 87 5/8.   South Carolina's competitive offering of $60 million of triple-A general obligation bonds went smoothly. A Merrill Lynch Capital Markets group's bid produced a net interest cost of 6.896%. Orders drew the balance for the issue down to $24.5 million by late yesterday, with demand seen from property-casualty insurers and bank trust departments, according to a Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. official.   Strong sales enabled underwriters to reduce reoffering yields for about $75 million of Connecticut transportation infrastructure special tax obligation bonds. Underwriters led by Bear Stearns trimmed most yields five to 10 basis points.</TEXT></DOC>
