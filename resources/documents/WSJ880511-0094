St Germain </HL><AUTHOR> Brooks Jackson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN BNK </IN><G> JUS CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Justice Department announced it won't prosecute Rep. Fernand St Germain for accepting free meals from a savings-and-loan lobbyist.    The Rhode Island Democrat, who is chairman of the House Banking Committee, was investigated for several months last year by a federal grand jury, which issued subpoenas for the expense-account records of lobbyist James Freeman and for some restaurants and night spots here.    Prosecutors were looking into the possibility that such free entertainment could be construed as illegal gratuities under the federal bribery statute, which makes it a felony for a federal official to accept &quot;anything of value . . . for or because of any official act.&quot;    The case was complicated by House rules, which generally forbid members from taking gifts valued at more than $100 a year from any lobbyist. An exception allows unlimited free meals or entertainment as long as the value of any one item doesn't exceed a certain amount, which was $35 until last year, when it was raised to $50.    Mr. St Germain's attorney, Raymond Banoun, said his client was gratified with the outcome of the investigation. &quot;We've always felt that we would ultimately prevail on this,&quot; Mr. Banoun said. He said he had been able to prove, among other things, that Mr. St Germain wasn't in Washington on some of the days that Mr. Freeman listed him as a guest on his expense reimbursements.    Persons familiar with the investigation said Mr. Freeman charged a substantial amount of expenses for entertaining Mr. St Germain to his expense account. Mr. Banoun said the total couldn't be determined accurately. &quot;When a businessman such as a lobbyist is constantly out every night, and does not prepare his expense accounts until weeks or months after he's paid the bills, he has to reconstruct it,&quot; Mr. Banoun said. &quot;We were able to show that on many of those days the congressman was not in town.&quot;    Although other lobbyists were also questioned, the investigation focused primarily on Mr. Freeman, who was granted immunity from prosecution in return for his testimony. Mr. Freeman, now a private consultant, was until last year employed by the U.S. League of Savings Associations, the principal lobbying arm of the thrift industry. Messrs. Freeman and St Germain were seen often together in restaurants and night clubs whose records the prosecutors also subpoenaed.    Rep. St Germain issued a statement saying the decision not to prosecute &quot;means the case is closed.&quot;    However, Justice Department officials were said to be debating whether to refer the matter to the House Ethics Committee. A spokesman for the ethics panel refused to comment on that possibility, as did a Justice Department spokesman.    &quot;I would hope that the Justice Department would see that there is no basis for referring it,&quot; Mr. Banoun said.    The Justice Department spokesman also refused comment on the decision not to seek an indictment. </TEXT></DOC>
