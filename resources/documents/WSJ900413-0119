The researchers from the biotechnology division of theU.S. Army Chemical Research and the University of Illinoissaid the new microbe performed successfully in a test onoil-soaked gravel and stones collected from Prince WilliamSound, the site of the Exxon Valdez spill.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Our results show that the microbial surfactant can removethree times as much oil as water can,&quot; said A.M. Chakrabarty,a microbiologist at the university, who led the experiment.Mr. Chakrabarty, while at General Electric Co., developed thefirst genetically engineered microbe to be patented.   The experiment with Valdez oil, however, didn't involve agenetically altered microbe. A public unease over the releaseof such man-made organisms in open environment has preventedthe use of such bacteria. The researchers instead used astrain of natural bacteria, called Pseudomonas aeruginosa,that was forced through a natural selection process to liveon solid and liquid hydrocarbons that are the building blocksin oil.   Mr. Chakrabarty also said that by the time his groupfinished its experiment Exxon was already far into itscleaning process with warm water jet sprays and an army ofscrubbers. He said his team nevertheless suggested themicrobial solution to the oil company, but &quot;we didn't get afavorable response.&quot;   Robert Mastracchio, technical manager at Exxon AlaskaOperations in Anchorage, said that only 74 miles of the 1,089miles of coastal lines Exxon cleaned last year were suitablefor biological remediation. The company has been usingspecial chemical fertilizers there to stimulate the localbacteria to speed up the degradation nature does on its own.He said that Exxon didn't think &quot;it was necessary&quot; tointroduce foreign bacteria. &quot;It raises questions about whatimpact it will have on the environment,&quot; he said.   The bacteria clean up the oil just as common dishwashingsoap pulls grease out of water. Oil is insoluble in water.But the soap emulsifies the grease into tiny droplets thatcan be grabbed by water molecules and dragged down the drain.Using the same trick, the Pseudomonas aeruginosa firstreleases a soap-like surfactant to emulsify the oil into tinydroplets. That allows the bacteria to take up the oil, whichthey then convert into carbon dioxide and water.   In their experiment, the researchers washed paired batchesof the oil-coated Alaskan gravels, one batch in each pairwith water and the other with a 1% solution of Pseudomonasaeruginosa surfactant. They then repeated the process atseveral different temperatures on a scale from 10 to 80degrees Celsius. In their report, published in the latestissue of Bio/Technology journal, the researchers said thesurfactant removed at least twice as much oil as did water atevery temperature tested.   The surfactant removed three and a half times as much oilas water at 40 degrees, and 2.4 times at 50 degrees.   The report suggested that surfactant may be particularlyuseful at low temperatures, which make oil dispersal withwater difficult. At 30 degrees, for instance, water removesonly 5% of the oil. At that temperature, the surfactantsolution removes three times as much oil within a minuteafter contact. Mr. Chakrabarty said that higher concentrationof the microbial solution cleans more oil, but addssignificantly to the cost.   He said a big advantage the microbial surfactant has overchemical surfactants is that it's nontoxic and biodegradable.The oil released with warm water tends to go back into thesea unless special measures are taken to contain it.   &quot;We think that microbial surfactant is the only ecologicalacceptable way to tackle oil spills in coastal areas,&quot; Mr.Chakrabarty said.   The use of microbes to treat oil pollution and hazardouswaste, as well as for oil recovery from deep wells, isgetting increasing attention from researchers. That's becausetraditional remedies, which involve chemical treatment orincineration, are either expensive or environmentally unsafe.But environmentalists and ecologists' fear that alteredbacteria, however natural, may upset the balance of nature.The opposition is even more fierce to the use of geneticallyengineered microbes, which can do specific tasks moreeffectively than natural bacteria can.   Mr. Chakrabarty's genetically altered microbe, which wonthe first patent in 1981 after a celebrated Supreme Courtdecision, is languishing in a GE laboratory. HermanFinkbeiner, manager of GE's biological sciences laboratory,said GE decided to suspend further work on the microbelargely because of public concern.</TEXT></DOC>
