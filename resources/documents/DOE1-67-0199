Examples are found fora situation in which two charged Bose-Einstein condensates coexist inequilibrium in systems described by Abelian gauge theories. Also Abelianand non-Abelian systems are constructed for which a charged Bose-Einsteincondensate is balanced by the charge of a fermionic subsystem. A limitingtransition to infinitely heavy fermions with infinite chemical potentialis pointed out, which turns the fermionic subsystem into an externalcharge in an Abelian theory. On the contrary, the non-Abelian gauge theorywith external charge cannot be obtained by the same dynamical limitingprocess since it requires a special quantization scheme. It is realizedfor the Yang-Mills-Higgs model with a constant external charge. Eigenfrequenciesof the system are found, which include an additional quantum degree offreedom induced by the external charge. The contribution of the eigenfrequenciesto the thermodynamical potential is found.</TEXT></DOC>
