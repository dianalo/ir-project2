Donald Kessler, a project scientist at NASA's Johnson Space Center, told an international conference on space pollution that a particle could strike and damage a spacecraft. The debris ranges in size from old non-functioning satellites and rocket boosters to nuts and bolts and even smaller parts from disintegrating spacecraft.    Mr. Kessler estimated that at least 48,000 objects one centimeter or larger are in orbit about the Earth, but told a Colloquium of the International Astronomical Union yesterday that the true number is probably much higher.    In June of 1983, a window of the space shuttle Challenger was replaced after being struck by a piece of orbiting debris that caused a small pit. Later, chemical analysis revealed the window had been hit by a fleck of paint a tiny fraction of an inch in diameter.    Mr. Kessler says such collisions involving the space shuttle are rare because of the vehicle's low orbit and the relatively short amount of time the shuttle spends in space. Longer space missions will require additional protection.    &quot;The problem gets to be more severe for something like the space station, which is planned to be continuously there for 30 years,&quot; he said yesterday.    Shields are currently being designed to protect the crew from debris about one centimeter in diameter, the size of a marble. &quot;The shields weigh an extra 2,000 pounds per module. There are six modules, so that's an extra 12,000 pounds of weight that are having to be put into orbit because of the orbital debris environment,&quot; Mr. Kessler said.    A presidential directive now requires that American spacecraft be designed to minimize the creation of space debris. Future rocket boosters, said Mr. Kessler, will probably be designed to fall back to Earth. He estimated that redesigning boosters might increase their cost by 10% to 20%. </TEXT></DOC>
