In addition, the generally validdifferential equations of motion of an arbitrary particle in phase spacein the curved coordinate system are derived, explicitly giving the secondderivative of the particle's coordinates with respect to the arc lengths of the central trajectory. These equations can be easily solved bynumerical methods (e.g. Runge-Kutta method), thus giving the opportunityto study in a complete way ion optical aberrations by ray tracing. Themethods developed could be a suitable base for corresponding resultsfor the general case of dipole magnets with arbitrary angles betweenthe end faces.</TEXT></DOC>
