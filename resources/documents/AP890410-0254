The company also announced a faster version of its 80386 chipand a lower-power version of its less-expensive 80386SX chip thatis suited for laptop computers.   The new i486, also known as the 80486, puts Intel intohead-to-head competition with Motorola Inc.'s 68040 chip announcedless than two weeks ago, industry analysts said. It crams 1.2million transistors onto a piece of silicon just over a half-inchsquare.   The 80386, by contrast, contains one-fourth as many transistors,or 275,000.   A computer with the chip will perform operations 50 times fasterthan the original IBM personal computer and will be able to run anysoftware developed for the 80386, House said.   Meanwhile, Intel said six companies _ American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co., Award Software Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co., MicrosoftCorp., Phar Lap Software Inc., and Phoenix Technologies Ltd. _announced products based on the technology.   In addition, Prime Computer Inc. said it would work with Intelto design processors based on the i486 that would run eight timesfaster than the i486 alone.   ``The 486 is a fantastic advance. It's a major improvement inspeed, but it is the same architecture as the 386,'' said MicrosoftChairman Bill Gates. ``The most exciting thing is the protection itoffers the investment'' that users have made in software.   The chip will not be available until this fall, and won't beproduced in quantity until late this year, Intel said in a newsrelease.   The new 80386 chip, called the 80386DX, will run at 33 millioncycles per second and is 25 times faster than the original IBM PC,House said.   Computer and software makers, meanwhile, praised theannouncement of the i486 and stressed the importance of the newchip's compatibility with the 80386.   ``That level of compatibility ensures that the software you runtoday will run on future workstations,'' said John Frank, presidentof Zenith Data Systems.   ``Now we'll see a stable platform for software development overthe next several years that will allow the full capabilities of the386 architecture to be implemented,'' said Rod Canion, presidentand chief executive of Compaq Computer Corp.   Karl Koessel, technical editor of PC World magazine, called thechip ``the next generation'' of computer technology.   ``It is much faster and it is compatible,'' Koessel said. ``Whatpeople want is compatibility, and the 486 does everything the 386does.''</TEXT></DOC>
