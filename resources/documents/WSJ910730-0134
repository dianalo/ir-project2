Coverage of the recentcongressional investigation failed to distinguish betweenindividual and employer group LTC policies. Consequently,consumers who are part of an employer group plan or areconsidering enrolling in one may be concerned unnecessarily.   Having sold the first employer group LTC plan in 1987,Aetna is a leader today in the sale of employer group LTCplans. It has sold group LTC policies to 21 employers andcovers 48,000 lives.</LP><TEXT>   Most of the problems cited by congressional investigators,such as excessive commissions and misrepresentation ofbenefits, are unheard of in connection with employer groupLTC policies because there is no agent involved. Policies aresold to employers, who negotiate on behalf of theiremployees. Like other insurance products, employer group LTChas gone through an evolutionary process that generally hasmade policies more comprehensive. The spectacular growth inthe number of policies purchased in the past five years is atestament to these improvements.   Robert F.
