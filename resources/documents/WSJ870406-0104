Unbeknownst to Mr. Silverstein, Jerry Reinsdorf, the founder of the real estate syndicator, was beginning to look for someone to succeed himself as Balcor's president and chief executive officer. At the 1984 interview, it became clear that Mr. Silverstein wasn't interested in the chief financial officer's job -- and that Mr. Reinsdorf had bigger plans.    So, instead of winning business from Chicago-based Balcor, Mr. Silverstein wound down his own business and joined Balcor as chief operating officer and Mr. Reinsdorf's heir apparent. Balcor became an American Express Co. subsidiary in 1982, and Mr. Reinsdorf signed a management agreement that expires at the end of this year, when he plans to leave.    Since joining Balcor, Mr. Silverstein, who reports to American Express's Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. brokerage, has taken the added title of chief executive. He became president this year.    As serendipitous as Mr. Silverstein's rise seems, the 38-year-old Boston-area native and former Playboy Enterprises Inc. chief financial officer faces tough problems. One is perceptual. Seasoned competitors note that all but one of Balcor's founders are leaving, and, as one syndicator says, &quot;What does a former Playboy executive know about real estate?&quot;    But Mr. Reinsdorf, 51, who is now just chairman, has no doubts. &quot;It's always good for a CEO to have a finance background, but he must also have imagination. You either have it or you don't. I asked myself, 'Is this the kind of guy that can bring out creativity in others?' In Steve we've got that.&quot;    As good as the personal chemistry between Messrs. Reinsdorf and Silverstein has been, they are an unlikely pair to hit it off. Soft-spoken and polished, Mr. Silverstein fits in well in a corporate boardroom, whereas the gregarious Mr. Reinsdorf, part-owner of the Chicago White Sox baseball team and Chicago Bulls basketball team, seems more at home in a bar arguing batting averages.    At Playboy, Mr. Silverstein's job was to pare away unprofitable operations, including its London casino, domestic clubs and resorts. Mr. Silverstein, who holds a University of Chicago MBA, found converting assets to cash didn't satisfy his longing for creativity. &quot;I realized that it was a job I really didn't enjoy,&quot; he says.    At Balcor, Mr. Silverstein's most pressing challenge is to stem the slippage in its major area of business: packaging and selling limited partnerships investing in real estate. The new tax law has virtually wiped out real estate syndication for tax purposes and made the business much more competitive. Sales of Balcor public partnerships were $351 million last year, down from $834 million in 1985.    In addition, sales of Balcor properties have yielded investors a 6% average annual compounded return, somewhat lower than many competitors, according to Robert A. Stanger andamp; Co., a Shrewsbury, N.J., investment adviser. Mr. Silverstein disputes Stanger's figures: &quot;Our track record is considerably better than that.&quot;    Balcor's critics argue that the terms of American Express's purchase of Balcor are at the root of the current troubles. Under the terms, Balcor's partners were paid $54 million, plus another $50 million to be paid if certain sales goals were met over the next five years. Mr. Reinsdorf says those sales goals were met in 3 1/2 years. Industry executives argue it would have been better to base the incentive compensation on the investment performance of the partnerships rather than sales of partnership units.    &quot;I have a feeling that they grew too fast and didn't pay enough attention to the properties that they were buying. Their problems are going to continue for a while,&quot; one industry executive says.    Mr. Reinsdorf says that problems are isolated and that he is leaving Balcor in good shape. Adds Mr. Silverstein, &quot;We've gone to great pains to deal with problems by funding deficits ourselves and restructuring partnerships.&quot;    Mr. Silverstein sees his task as diversifying Balcor into new areas, particularly into short-term lending. Since 1979, Balcor has been making 10-year to 15-year mortgages in which the partnership shares in a project's cash flow. But more recently, Balcor has gone after shorter real estate loans with terms from one day to five years. Balcor now has $800 million in these loans outstanding and another $1 billion in loan commitments. It also has arranged $100 million in credit lines with the Bass brothers of Texas and builder and New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon.    Commercial real estate lending has become increasingly competitive in recent months as Japanese banks have accelerated their lending pace and U.S. commercial banks have lured intermediate-term loans away from insurance companies.    In this competitive market, &quot;The difference between us and a bank is that we're prepared to own the real estate,&quot; says Mr. Silverstein. &quot;Consequently we might give the borrower more money than a bank, and we can have an answer to him more quickly -- in a couple of weeks.&quot;    Also, last year Balcor formed an arm to make real estate investments on behalf of pension funds, foundations and endowments. So far, Balcor hasn't signed up a client, but, given those institutions' reputation for painstaking decision-making, the time factor isn't unusual. &quot;Though we have no direct investment money as of now, we expect soon to announce a major commitment,&quot; says Mr. Silverstein.    Attracting investment dollars from the Far East is another opportunity that Balcor has targeted. Mr. Reinsdorf believes Nippon Life Insurance Co.'s recent purchase of a stake in Shearson should create new opportunities for Balcor. American Express also recently announced plans for a public offering of some Shearson stock.    While syndication will play a lesser role in Balcor's future, the company isn't forsaking the business. Balcor is considering sponsoring a $301 million partnership that would invest in zero-coupon first and second mortgages and is also weighing the purchase of a syndication company needing capital to support partnerships that are running deficits. Mr. Silverstein sees it as an opportunity: &quot;The properties may be running a deficit, but they can still be good properties.&quot; Still, as Balcor's other business segments grow, syndications' share of its earnings could slip to 20% from 35%.    Despite some hurdles, Mr. Silverstein prefers these challenges to the task of shrinking Playboy. He says, &quot;Our understanding (with Shearson management) is that we want to grow our company.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
