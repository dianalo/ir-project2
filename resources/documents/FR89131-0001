This rule sets forth proceduresunder which a potential leave recipient may submit an application to hisor her employing agency and establishes rules for agencies to administerthe program.

This authority will terminateon October 31, 1993. The program established by these regulations willreplace the temporary leave transfer program established under Pub. L.'s100-202 and 100-440.These interim regulations incorporate some of the suggestions made in commentsOPM received on the interim regulations governing the fiscal year 1988temporary leave transfer program (53 FR 7325, March 8, 1988, and 53 FR14775, April 26, 1988). The major differences between the voluntary leavetransfer program authorized by Pub. L. 100-566 and the temporary leavetransfer program authorized by Pub. L.'s 100-202 and 100-440 are the following:<T3>Definition of ``medical emergency.''</T3> Under the new law and interimregulations, an employee experiencing a ``medical emergency'' (includinga medical condition of a family member) is eligible to become a leave recipientunder the voluntary leave transfer program. In addition, the interim regulationsdefine the term ``family member.'' Previously, an employee experiencinga ``personal emergency'' was eligible to participate in the temporary leavetransfer program, and the term ``family member'' was not defined. (SeeandSection;andSection;630.901(a) and 630.902.)<T3>Agency response time for applications to become a leave recipient.</T3>The new law and interim regulations now require an agency to make a determinationon an application to become a leave recipient and provide written noticeto the applicant of its determination within 10 days (excluding Saturdays,Sundays, and legal public holidays). Previously, the response time foragencies was 30 days. (See andSection;630.905 (d) and (e).)<T3>Interagency leave transfer.</T3> The interim regulations now requirethe employing agency of the leave recipient to accept the transfer of annualleave from a donor employed in another agency if (1) the leave donor isa ``family member'' of the leave recipient; (2) the leave recipient's employingagency determines that the amount of annual leave donated within the agencymay not be sufficient to meet the needs of the leave recipient; or (3)in the judgment of the leave recipient's employing agency, acceptance ofleave transferred from another agency would further the purpose of thevoluntary leave transfer program. Previously, interagency transfer of leavewas at the discretion of the leave recipient's employing agency and waspermitted only when the leave recipient's employing agency determined thatthe amount of annual leave donated within the agency may not be sufficientto meet the needs of the leave recipient. (See andSection;630.906(f).)<T3>Accrual of annual and sick leave.</T3> The new law and interim regulationslimit the amount of annual and sick leave a leave recipient may accruewhile using transferred leave to 5 days of annual and 5 days of sick leave,for use <T3>after</T3> the medical emergency terminates. Previously, there wasno limit on the accrual of leave by a leave recipient. (See andSection;630.907.)<T3>Waiver of limitations on donation of annual leave.</T3> The new lawand interim regulations permit a waiver of the limitations on the amountof annual leave an employee may donate to a leave recipient in a givenleave year. The interim regulations require each agency to establish writtencriteria for waiving these limitations in unusual circumstances. Previously,these limitations could not be waived. (See andSection;630.908(c).)<T3>Options for restoration of leave.</T3> Under the new law and interimregulations, leave donors may elect to have unused donated annual leaverestored during the current leave year or during the following leave year.In addition, leave donors may elect to donate restored leave in whole orpart to another leave recipient. (See andSection;630.911(e).)Finally, the new law and interim regulations require agencies to implementthe new voluntary leave transfer program by April 30, 1989. Until an agencyimplements its new program, the current temporary leave transfer programauthorized by Pub. L.'s 100-202 and 100-440 remains in effect. (See andSection;andSection;630.903and 630.914.)Pursuant to section 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3) of title 5, United States Code,I find that good cause exists for waiving the general notice of proposedrulemaking and for making this amendment effective in less than 30 days.The notice and the 30-day delay in the effective date are being waivedbecause of the need to facilitate the implementation of the voluntary leavetransfer program by Federal agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation</ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>I certify that these regulations will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because they will affect onlyFederal employees and agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 630</ITAG>Government employees.<ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.</ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Part 630 of Title 5 of the Code of FederalRegulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 630_ABSENCE AND LEAVE</ITAG>1.
