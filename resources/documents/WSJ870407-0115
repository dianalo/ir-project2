It was so modest it wasn't even pictured in the auction catalog. But within moments the bidding had shot past the $1,350 Sotheby's had predicted, and at $20,000, the little gem seemed destined for an elegant dowager in black.    In fact, auctioneer Nicholas Raynor had just slammed down his hammer when a jeweled hand shot up on the other side of the big striped tent. Mr. Raynor paused, then smiled. &quot;It's for charity. I'm going to reopen the bidding,&quot; he announced.    Prices again bounced across the room, and at $25,000 the woman in black bowed out, glowering at the auctioneer. Before long, however, she was back in the fray, and strolled off with several royal souvenirs.    Charity was not exactly the first word that came to most people's minds during the two-day sale of the Duchess of Windsor's jewels here last week. During the eight hours it took to sell more than 300 of her gilded mementos, an international gaggle of the perfumed and wealthy engaged in ferocious checkbook battle. An emerald engagement ring reached an eye-popping $2.1 million while the duchess's 40th birthday present, a flowing ruby-and-diamond necklace, cost $2.6 million. Even the sale's cheapest item, a silver cigar piercer that resembled a matchstick, was hardly a giveaway at $3,700.    Here in Geneva, the mention of these prices, which even some buyers admitted were a little silly, inevitably brought up the name of the sale's beneficiary, Paris's Pasteur Institute, which does AIDS research. &quot;If you take into consideration how this money is used, the price is not so bad,&quot; opined Tsuneo Takagi, the Japanese jewelry importer who plunked down $3.15 million for a diamond ring the size of an ice cube. Yet had the $50 million raised by the jewels gone into the pocket of the duchess's chauffeur, the prices probably would have been as high.    Even the $50 catalog, studded with snippets of the couple's amorous baby talk, was a bonanza, selling more than 20,000 copies. (The auctioneers usually print 4,000.) After many a year out of fashion, those great chunks of stone and immense settings the duchess loved were once again in vogue, as part of what the Brits call &quot;the Dynasty look.&quot; The persistent, almost prurient, interest in British royals also buoyed prices for the duke's memorabilia. There were cards of his hunting buttons and framed photographs of the royal family. Pointing to one of the duke's sporrans, the little pouches worn with kilts, Sotheby's director, John Marion, remarked, &quot;People plan to use these as evening bags.&quot;    Sotheby's, which is pretty savvy about marketing, choreographed the sale with great care. The catalog, with its handsome cover portrait of the duchess, was long on romance. The jewels were not brought to England, where they might have embarrassed the royal family. Brits of a certain age still cluck with disapproval over &quot;that Simpson woman,&quot; who stole the heart of their king. Yet a few think she did the nation a huge favor. One wonders a bit about the leadership capabilities of a 38-year-old who wrote: &quot;I love you more andamp; more andamp; more andamp; please come down to say goodnight to David. I haven't seen you once today andamp; I can't take it.&quot;    At the actual sale, admission was by ticket only and the action was in a jaunty party tent that seated 1,200 and overlooked Lake Geneva. Oddly enough, it stood a few yards from where another royal, Princess Elizabeth II of Austria, was stabbed to death in 1898 by a political fanatic.    The spectators looked like an advertisement for some expensive luxury product. The works of all the big fashion designers were on parade. And the predictable local titles turned up, an easy mix of princes, counts and Thyssens. Missing were the film and rock stars the photographers were waiting to snap. &quot;Joan Collins isn't here,&quot; wailed one disgruntled photographer who had to make do with singer Shirley Bassey.    Some of the successful bidders proved maddeningly elusive. Among the coyest was a well-dressed agent for Mohamed Al-Fayed, the owner of Harrod's, the London luxury department store. Mr. Al-Fayed wants to turn the Windsors' French residence-in-exile into a museum, and his rep reportedly snapped up some exquisite baubles, including the duchess's $806,000 flamingo brooch, with its ruby-encrusted wing, and the charm bracelet of crosses she wore with her famous Wallis-blue wedding gown in 1937. But though he smiled and even giggled as he bid, the agent declined to discuss his master's spoils.    On the other hand, Marvin Mitchelson, the snowy-haired Los Angeles divorce attorney, was delighted to talk. As the television cameras rolled, he held up a dogeared photograph of his late mother, an amethyst-lover, and, getting misty-eyed, proclaimed that he bought the duchess's $555,000 amethyst necklace in her memory. &quot;Here was a man who really loved his wife,&quot; he declared. Then, flipping through his catalog, Mr. Mitchelson located a sapphire pendant and matching sapphire earrings, each in the $300,000 range. &quot;I bought one of these,&quot; he said a bit distractedly. And he wasn't certain which? &quot;It's for a client,&quot; he replied.    Elizabeth Taylor also let the world know she had secured the Prince of Wales's $575,000 brooch with diamonds in the three-feather Prince of Wales pattern. And the following day, the newspapers gleefully printed the rumor that Prince Charles had been an underbidder. But that was his second choice, according to The People, one of Britain's randier Sunday tabloids. &quot;Di had set her heart on the panther-shaped bracelet,&quot; the paper wrote. The queen, appalled at the thought of her daughter-in-law wearing it in public, supposedly agreed to let Charles bid for something less showy. Buckingham Palace had no comment on the matter.    If Charles was a disappointed bidder, he was not alone. The bidding was so keen and prices so surprising, a lot of people left grouchy and disgruntled. On Saturday afternoon, when the action was over and most buyers had gone home, an American couple sipped champagne in a salon of the Beau-Rivage and relived the recent events. &quot;It was extremely exciting, just being there,&quot; the man said. But his companion just sighed. &quot;All that, and to think all we got was a card of buttons.&quot;    ---   Ms. Trucco is a free-lance writer living in London. </TEXT></DOC>
