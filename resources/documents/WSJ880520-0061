The group wouldn't forecast results for all of 1988, but company officials said privately that they expect to post a profit, halting 12 years of losses.    The French steel group has benefited from a European Community-wide program of steel-production controls, import quotas and company restructurings. &quot;This is part of a European steel reawakening,&quot; said a Usinor Sacilor official.    &quot;Up to now, the French steel industry never was in a position to benefit from a strong business climate,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it is.&quot; The company cited strong demand from auto makers, construction companies and appliance makers.    European steelmakers still depend on trade protection through agreements with foreign producers, essentially the Japanese, limiting steel imports to 10% of EC consumption. And Usinor Sacilor officials said that within Europe, British Steel is a more efficient producer. Still, the French now insist that they have emerged as one of the European steelmakers that can survive in world competition.    &quot;If the climate gets bad again, we no doubt will lose money again,&quot; the Usinor Sacilor official said. &quot;But we will lose less than we used to. And when things get better, we will be in a position to respond and make money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
