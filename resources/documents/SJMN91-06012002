Lyndon Johnson used the so-calledTonkin Gulf incident to start the military action. To my knowledge, Congressnever did declare war.;    I say the commander in chief has all the power heneeds to start military action. Congress can do as it pleases, declare ornot.;    Article II, Section 2: &quot;The president shall be Commander-in-Chief ofthe Army and Navy of the United States . . .&quot; It does not read &quot;by and withthe advice and consent of Congress.&quot; So much for congressional posturing overthe Middle East problem.;    -- Richard A. Schlink; Santa Clara; (hbox);Regardless of the Bush-bashing over the gulf, I don't believe he wants abattle any more than anyone else.;    The problem remains one of Iraq'saggression. Iraq certainly did not &quot;negotiate&quot; its differences with Kuwait;why should anyone negotiate with Iraq?;    Someone must stop Saddam Husseinbefore he kills millions, and if the job falls to the United States, so beit.;    -- T.M.
