The lands proposed for leasing comprise approximately600 acres and are in the southern portion of the Campo Indian Reservation,located between Campo, California, and Jacumba, California, and betweenthe Mexican border and Interstate 8.The solid waste sanitary landfill will be located on a parcel within theleased premises designated for this purpose. The facility is planned toaccept non-hazardous waste, including sewage sludge and septage. The capacityof the landfill will exceed 60 million cubic yards, sufficient to disposeof 2,000 tons per day (TPD) of waste for over 40 years.A composting facility may be established adjacent to the landfill and equippedwith a tub grinder, movable screening apparatus, front-end loaders, measuringinstruments, and sampling devices. Source separated waste will be transportedto the composting facility in designated truck, trailers, and/or containers.The finished compost will be usable for public or private purposes as soilamendment or conditioner and as landfill cover material.The proposed materials recovery facility (MRF) will be located on a parcelof ten acres or less. It will consist of a building or buildings housingequipment for the sorting and separation of recyclable materials and outdoorarea for preliminary processing, materials storage, loading, and containerhandling. The MRF will provide (a) intermediate processing of commingledsource-separated recyclable materials, primarily from residences, (b) sortingof commercial waste collections, and/or (c) processing of constructionand demolition debris. A number of mechanical and manual operations providesufficient flexibility to accommodate various recyclable and waste streamsand to produce scrap materials and products that can be marketed. A buy-backcenter may also be established if the incoming materials warrant. Offices,maintenance areas, and employee facilities will be included in the MRF.The alternatives tentatively identified for consideration in the EIS are:(1) No action, (2) a similar project of reduced capacity, and (3) a similarproject elsewhere in the southern California region (4) to build the projectas planned.The principal impact associated with the proposed action is the potentialfor groundwater contamination related to the construction of the landfill.Other impacts are related to dust, noise, vectors, and odors associatedwith refuse operations, in addition, there are transportation, Seismic,Biological and Cultural Resource issues.The environmental review of this project will be conducted in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,as amended (42 U.S.C. 4371 et. seq.) and Council on Environmental QualityRegulations (40 CFR andSection; 1500-1508) according to Department of InteriorProcedures for Compliance (516 DM 1-6) with the aforementioned regulations.It is estimated that the Draft EIS will be available for public reviewby late 1989 or early 1990. This Notice is published under authority delegatedto the Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs by the Secretary of the Interiorunder 209 DM 8.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 20, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Patrick A.
