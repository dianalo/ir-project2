Eastern's Machinists are walking picket lines alone after beingabandoned by pilots and flight attendants, who voted to return towork this past week after more than eight months on strike.   At Boeing, however, their fellow Machinists returned to workafter ending a 48-day strike and gaining what is considered astrong new contract.   ``It (Boeing) was much more of a traditional collectivebargaining experience, a much cleaner bargaining environment,''Mark Kahn, an independent labor arbitrator, said Friday. ``Easternis at the other extreme ... It isn't just a matter of economics.''   The Eastern pilots' and flight attendants' decisions to endtheir strikes _ which were begun in sympathy with a Machinistsstrike on March 4 _ was a stinging blow to the Machinists and a keyvictory for Frank Lorenzo, head of Eastern's parent Texas Air Corp.The hard-to-replace pilots had given the Machinists crucial supportin their battle against Lorenzo and their walkout had virtuallyshut Eastern down in the early days of the strike.   At Boeing, where the Machinists struck alone, a much shorterwalkout ended last Monday when 81.4 percent of the membershipratified the new 3-year contract. Although the union failed to getthe full wage increase it sought, it scored other points _including cost-of-living adjustments that will account forvirtually all inflation.   The 57,000 Machinists at Boeing, the world's biggest commercialaircraft maker, had secure jobs to go back to. Their prosperouscompany, with a swollen backlog of orders, didn't attempt tocontinue full production during the strike.   Many of the workers who struck financially troubled Eastern, onthe other hand, have been replaced over the months as thefinancially sagging airline has rebuilt itself on a smaller scaleunder bankruptcy court supervision.   Miami-based Eastern warned the pilots and flight attendantsunions Thursday that they won't necessarily get their old jobs back.   The Eastern Machinists also have been seeking higher wages, butthe bitterly contested issues at the airline have gone beyondeconomics. Eastern's unions have demanded the removal of Lorenzo,charging him with trying to bust the union and draining assets fromEastern to its sister carrier Continental Airlines.   The financial conditions and economics of Eastern and Boeing _as well as their unions _ also are vastly different.   The 8,500 Eastern Machinists are about equally divided betweentwo distinct groups: relatively skilled aircraft mechanics and lessskilled ramp service workers, who fuel planes, handle baggage anddrive motorized equipment on airport runways. After the strikebegan, Eastern was able to contract out much of the ramp servicework.   At Boeing, the union represents skilled production workers, whoperform tasks ranging from riveting, wiring and plumbing inaircraft to quality inspections and machine-tool maintenance. Theirskills make them difficult to replace.   Another factor on the returning strikers may have been the pullof the holiday season. Both the Eastern and Boeing workers decidedto end their walkouts the week of Thanksgiving. The prospect ofholidays punctuated by continued struggles to make ends meet couldnot have been cheering for the employees and their families.   In each case, there also was a specific catalyst that appearedto trigger the end of the strikes.   At Eastern, the catalyst was President Bush's veto last Tuesdayof union-backed legislation that would set up a blue-ribboncommission to investigate the dispute. That directly precipitatedthe action by the pilots and attendants.   In the case of Boeing, however, the catalyst seemed to work inthe Machinists' favor. As some of Boeing's big airline customersstarted to express public anxiety about further delays in jetdeliveries due to the strike, the company appeared more pressed tomake a deal with the union.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Economic reports pointed to continued sluggishness in thenation's manufacturing sector and a small inflationary spurt inOctober. Orders for durable goods dipped 0.6 percent while theConsumer Price Index rose 0.5 percent.   _A number of major airlines announced plans to raise fares onmost domestic routes and eliminate discount fares used mainly bybusiness travelers.   _Wall Street woes continued. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the nation'slargest retail brokerage, announced a restructuring that it saidwould include layoffs and other cost cutting, while Shearson LehmanHutton Inc. said it would cut stockbroker commissions for the firsttime in 15 years.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Nov. 25-26</NOTE></DOC>
