Morgan andamp; Co., not one to boast, lets itsstock do the talking. Morgan's shares and its business arebooming, and analysts look for a strong third quarter.   Some investors expect trading profits and tax benefits todrive strong third-quarter results. And Morgan, with its&quot;impeccable reputation,&quot; as one analyst put it, could gain ifscandal-plagued Salomon Inc. suffers. Those were good reasonsfor investors to jump in. Morgan shares broke out of a longtrading range and climbed $1.125, to close at $58.25 in NewYork Stock Exchange composite trading Friday. Morgan also wasthe volume leader, with nearly 11 million shares trading, butthat was attributable to a dividend-capture strategy. Averagedaily volume in Morgan has been about 400,000 shares.Analysts say the company will surely be among those tobenefit from any loss of business Salomon might suffer as aresult of the spreading scandal surrounding that firm and itsactivities at certain government securities auctions.</LP><TEXT>   George Salem, analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. andauthor of a recent 120-page report on J.P. Morgan, adds thathe expects Morgan to significantly increase market share inall its businesses: investment banking, trading, underwritingand commercial banking. He believes the company is undergoinga fundamental market revaluation as it becomes a financialpowerhouse and he expects the stock price to surpass $80 inthe next two years.   As reported, Morgan expects to report a gain of about 17cents a share from the sale of an equity stake in CentreReinsurance Holdings Ltd. In addition, analysts expect thecompany to show a gain as interest on Brazilian debt flows tothe income statement. And tax benefits connected to reservesestablished between 1987 and 1989 for developing-country debtshould boost earnings, too, analysts say.   With those gains, J.P. Morgan could earn $1.30 to $1.40 ashare in the third quarter, analysts say. A year earlier, thecompany had per-share net of $1.08. Offsetting performance inthe current quarter is an expected $117 million rise innonperforming loans in the current quarter. Analysts believemost of those loans are to Columbia Gas System Inc., whichrecently filed for Chapter 11 protection. Morgan was biggestsingle lender to Columbia Gas. However, the increase innonperforming loans is on an already low base, and thoseloans are well-reserved, compared with competitors' loans.   Stan Weinstein, technical market analyst and publisher ofthe Professional Tape Reader, said the stock broke out of along trading pattern when it surpassed $56.75 on Thursday. Hecalls the stock a &quot;strong hold.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
