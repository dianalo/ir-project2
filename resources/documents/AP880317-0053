But another study says that at the worst, AIDS could cut thegrowth rate of a typical central African country in half.   ``It's a disaster from any point of view,'' said John Bongaartsof the Population Council in New York, who did the second study.   Today's projections appear in the British journal Nature.   They say that with low to moderate infection rates like those ofKenya, Uganda or Zaire, population declines would not begin until20 to 70 years after the AIDS virus invades a developing country,even one with low growth rates.   The researchers stressed that their projections are crude andsaid too little is known about AIDS to make more realistic ones.   ``It is clear that AIDS will have an impact on swellingpopulation growth rates, but by how much is too sensitive to thingswe don't know about with sufficient certititude,'' said Robert Mayof Princeton University, who did the study with Roy Anderson andA.R. McLean of Imperial College in London.   ``Any (firm) long-term projection about whether AIDS will orwill not bring about zero or even negative rates of growth inAfrica cannot be made.''   In a telephone interview, May said the projections do notpertain to the United States or any other developed country.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome in Africa is thought tospread mainly through heterosexual contact, while most cases in theUnited States stem from homosexual contact or needle sharing byintravenous drug abusers.   The researchers said they found potential for eventualpopulation decline under a range of plausible assumptions for suchfactors as the fraction of infected people who will die from AIDS,the fraction of infected women's babies who are born infected andthe length of time the virus lies dormant before causing AIDS.   Projections are severely limited by lack of precise knowledge onsuch points, May said.   The federal Centers for Disease Control estimates that aninfected woman runs a 30 percent to 60 percent chance of givingbirth to an infected baby, and that 20 percent to 30 percent ofpeople infected with the virus develop AIDS within five years. TheCDC has no figure on the percentage of infected people whoeventually die from AIDS, a spokesman said.   One series of projections in Nature assumed an initial 4 percentgrowth rate like that of Kenya, where the population doubles aboutevery 16 years and residents have a normal life expectancy of 52years.   Assuming an eight-year dormant period for the virus, oneprojection forecast eventual population decline if half or 30percent of babies born to infected mothers are infected at birth.   A second projection took the same basic assumptions, set theinfected-newborn rate at 50 percent, and found eventual populationdecline if every infected person dies of AIDS.   Bongaarts said his projections come out differently because hedivided the hypothetical population into groups of high, medium andlow risk for AIDS.   He also said that ``very implausible estimates'' of theprevalence of AIDS virus infection would be needed to project zeropopulation growth or population decline.   His projections, in the worst case, find AIDS cutting the 3percent growth rate typical of central African nations in half.More likely is a reduction to 2 percent, he said.   But even that implies a doubling of the death rate, leading toan overwhelmed health care system and disrupted social structure,he said.</TEXT></DOC>
