In this respect the combination of solar energyand hydrogen, which is a renewable economic system totally friendly towardsthe environment, is valid as a solution. In Neunburg vorm Wald in EastBavaria, a large experimental and pilot project is being constructed.The primary object of this project is to subject components of solarhydrogen technology to a comphrehensive test. Ranging from photo-voltaicelectricity production through electricity utilization for hydrogen productionin electrolysis and storage of hydrogen to its use in energy convertersfor electricity, power and heat production, all the system componentsare combined on one site. This unique project has a special attraction.It has a long-term objective. Costs of 50 million DM are estimated forthe first phase up to the end of 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
