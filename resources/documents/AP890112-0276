Watkins, picked Thursday byPresident-elect Bush to head the Energy Department, brings to thejob an expertise in an area that has emerged as the department'sbiggest headache: nuclear weapons.   Watkins studied nuclear reactor engineering in 1958 at the OakRidge, Tenn., National Laboratory. He was an instructor at navalnuclear power training centers in 1960 and four years later tookcommand of the nuclear-powered submarine Snook.   The Oak Ridge lab is one link in the Energy Department'snationwide network of reactors and other nuclear weapons facilities.The aging complex has been crippled recently by a series of safetyand environmental problems, leaving the United States temporarilyunable to produce tritium, a radioactive gas that is vital to makingnuclear warheads.   One of Watkins' main tasks, if he is confirmed in the post by theSenate, would be to guide the department's mounting efforts torebuild the nuclear arms plants and clean up the environmentaldamage caused by four decades of bomb-making.   For two years before becoming a nuclear sub commander, Watkinswas an administrative assistant in the Naval Reactors Division ofthe Atomic Energy Commission, the forerunner of the EnergyDepartment, according to a Pentagon biography.   Watkins, 61, capped his 41-year Naval career with a four-yearstint as chief of naval operations, the service's top post, in therank of admiral. He retired in 1986.   Although some of his closest friends advised him against it,Watkins accepted President Reagan's request in October 1987 to headan AIDS study commission that had been rocked by internal disarrayand widespread public ridicule.   Under Watkins' leadership the AIDS panel produced a series ofwidely praised recommendations.   Watkins is described by associates as a clear-thinker who blendspractical experience with political savvy.   ``People can anticipate that he is a studied person, that is, hewill study the issues in great depth,'' said Capt. Brent Baker, whoserved with Watkins in the Mediterranean in 1978-79. ``He's a blendof nuclear submariner ... and a good judge of people.''   Watkins was born in Alhambra, Calif., near the Los Angelesharbor, on March 7, 1927. His mother, LouiseWard Watkins, ranunsuccessfully in 1938 for the Republican nomination to a Senateseat, one of the few women of her time to run for national office.   He later recalled that his mother would take him to nearby Navyports to watch the big ships come and go. She sometimes arranged toget aboard the ships, where they dined with officers and heard talesabout life on the high seas.   Inspired by those stories, and his first-hand look at sailors,Watkins decided to seek a life in the Navy. He entered the NavalAcademy at Annapolis, Md., in 1945, just as World War II was drawingto a close. He graduated in 1949.   Afterward, Watkins served aboard destroyers and submarines,earned a master's degree at the Naval Postgraduate School, and thenmade one of the key decisions in his career: specializing in thefield of nuclear submarines. He became a confidante of Adm. HymanRickover, the father of the modern nuclear Navy and the man whoplayed a key role in the careers of dozens of Navy leaders.   Rising within the Navy's ranks, Watkins became commander of thePacific Fleet, based at Honolulu. In March 1982, Reagan chose him aschief of naval operations.   Watkins helped oversee the big naval buildup, from 450 to nearly600 ships, that was at the heart of the Reagan administration'sdefense policy in the president's first term.   Watkins and his wife of 38 years, Sheila Jo, have raised sixchildren.</TEXT></DOC>
