Mutual funds that levy a sales charge, or load, have always enjoyed a big market share. But they don't necessarily earn a better return than no-load funds.    In fact, a study of 542 equity funds that was commissioned by The Wall Street Journal and conducted by Chicago-based Morningstar Inc. found that, on average, no-load funds performed slightly better than load funds in the year ended Sept. 30.    No-load funds also held their own against the increasingly popular low-load funds, which carry sales charges that are below the maximum 8.5%. The low-loads, in fact, did a little worse than the other two categories.    The relative rankings of these equity funds also held for the three-year, five-year and 10-year periods ended Sept. 30.    &quot;For investors, that means buying a load fund simply on the hopes of superior performance isn't a good reason,&quot; says Joe Mansueto, head of Morningstar, which also publishes the Mutual Fund Sourcebook.    Earlier and more comprehensive surveys have reached similar conclusions. As long ago as 1962, a survey by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School found that &quot;a higher sales charge is not indicative of superior performance.&quot;    Common sense dictates that performance would be &quot;pretty much the same&quot; among the different types of funds, says John Bogle, chairman of Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. and one of the staunchest proponents of the no-load approach. Otherwise, he says, an investor would have to believe that &quot;a sales charge imbues a portfolio manager with a particular ability.&quot;    Of course, sales charges aren't the only fees found in mutual funds. Investors also may encounter advisory fees and expenses for running the funds.    Therefore, a key number to evaluate in a fund's prospectus is its expense ratio, or the sum of advisory and maintenance fees expressed as a percentage of total assets, says Gerald W. Perritt, president of Investment Information Services Inc., Chicago. He says expense ratios of equity funds in 1985 ranged from 0.28% to 5.3% and averaged 1.3%.    All fund investors must consider those charges to arrive at the total cost of investing in a fund.    Investors buy load funds partly because such funds are actively sold by brokers and an increasing number of other commission-cullers, including insurance companies.    Mr. Mansueto and others also point to the comfort that some investors get from buying into a load fund run by a brokerage firm that's a household name.    About half of all equity mutual fund investors traditionally choose funds with loads, or sales charges, ranging from a few percentage points to a maximum of 8.5%. If fixed-income funds are counted, that figure jumps significantly.    The majority of recently popular government bond funds are load products. And those funds are substantial, accounting for $105.22 billion of the $381.65 billion total stock and bond fund assets at the end of September.    To make matters more confusing for investors, loads have been sneaking into mutual funds in unobtrusive ways. Until a few years ago, the split was simple: Funds were either load or no-load.    The no-load product represented &quot;consumer value,&quot; Mr. Bogle says, because 100% of the investor's money was deployed.    Mr. Bogle, whose firm markets more than 40 pure no-load funds, chafes at what he believes is misuse of the no-load label by some funds.    The no-load share of all mutual fund assets, which was 10% in 1969, had jumped to 50% by 1979. Mr. Bogle estimates the no-load share this year at 25%, about the same as in 1976.    But he says almost all of the decline in market share is due to a huge flow of investor dollars to the load government bond funds. The no-load share of equity mutual fund sales has remained fairly constant.    But Mr. Bogle and some others in the industry say the no-load designation is being used loosely. Even leaders of the No-Load Mutual Fund Association have a hard time nowadays defining just what constitutes a no-load fund. For years, in fact, the association has allowed funds with sales charges of as much as 3.5% to become members.    One of the grayest of the gray areas concerns so-called 12b-1 fees, named for the 1980 rule that first allowed funds to siphon cash from the investment pool to reimburse expenses related to growth, such as certain marketing costs.    The 12b-1 fees, which are taken from assets annually, have grown from a routine 25 basis points to an extreme of as much as 200 basis points, or 2% of a fund's assets.    Of the 450 funds in the no-load association, about 25% have 12b-1 plans in place, although some aren't yet implementing them.    No-load purists aren't the only ones concerned with the use of the no-load tag. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been pressing for more forthright disclosure of 12b-1 fees and for a requirement that any such fees be reviewed yearly.    Funds have increasingly been looking at what regulators consider a questionable use of 12b-1 fees -- combining them with loads and using the fees to help offset commission costs. The technique has further blurred an already murky area for many investors.    The common approaches to fund sales charges and other fees include:    --True no-load funds: They don't levy a sales charge or a 12b-1 fee.    --Low-load funds: They carry a front-end sales charge, generally no more than 3.5%, and may have a 12b-1 fee.    --Back-end load funds: They levy a sales charge or other fee when the investor gets out of a fund. This charge is often connected to a 12b-1 fee.    ---   Ms. Sebastian reports on mutual funds from The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.
