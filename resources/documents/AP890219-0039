The announcement came a day after Najib declared a nationwidestate of emergency and replaced seven members of his Cabinet whowere not members of his ruling People's Democratic Party ofAfghanistan.   In Islamabad, Pakistan, guerrillas trying to form their owninterim government failed to agree on a Cabinet list, and severaldelegates walked out of a meeting.   Guerrillas also claimed to have captured a provincial capital incentral Afghanistan, taking government soldiers prisoner and seizingarms and ammunition.   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said in an interview with BritishBroadcasting Corp. radio the military council will coordinateeconomic and military activities and will be formed ``in the nextfew days.'' He said the new council will not replace the Cabinet.   Wakil also said the emergency declared Saturday night was aprecautionary measure and a ``sign of strength, not weakness.'' Newsecurity measures will include house searches, he said.   Foreign ministry officials said seven members of the rulingparty's policy-making Central Committee are replacing the oustednon-party ministers.   ``We wanted to give a sign to the counterrevolutionaries and showthem the party is not finished,'' one senior party member said oncondition of anonymity. ``We are stronger than ever.''   A diplomat who refused to be identified further said thereshuffle and emergency indicate Najib will be harder to remove frompower.   ``He has surrounded himself with his people. He's showing thathe's now in charge, he's calling the shots now that the Soviets aregone,'' said the diplomat.   The Red Army withdrew the last of its troops from Afghanistan onWednesday under terms of a U.N.-mediated accord. They had been inAfghanistan for nine years backing Najib in his war with Moslemguerrillas.   There still are 10 non-party members in the Cabinet, includingPrime Minister Mohammad Hassan Sharq, his deputy and two vicepresidents.   The Pakistan-based guerrillas, who Saturday nominated leaders ofa government-in-exile in Pakistan, have vowed to bring down Najibnow that the Soviets are gone.   Moderate guerrilla factions walked out of the guerrilla councilsession Sunday that was to approve the nominations. They opposed thenomination of hardliner Ahmad Shah as prime minister.   The council, or shura, was scheduled to reconvene Monday inIslamabad.   Rebels said Sunday their combined forces captured Tarin Kot,provincial capital of the remote central province of Uruzgan, alongwith ``many'' government troops and a large quantity of arms andammunition in a battle Friday.   There was no independent confirmation of the report, which wascarried by the Afghan News Agency, a rebel medium based in Islamabad.   Tarin Kot is 60 miles from the nearest key highway and has littlestrategic importance. But its capture would bring to six the numberof provincial capitals to fall to the insurgents since Soviet forcesbegan leaving Afghanistan on May 15.   The guerrillas are said to control 90 percent of the countryside,but Najib's troops still hold most urban centers.   More troops, tanks and armored personnel carriers appeared onKabul streets Sunday morning. Few Afghans seemed to notice. Manysoldiers sat smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers or sipping teanext to their vehicles.   The state of emergency allows the government to suspend or limitconstitutional rights that protect against confiscation and searchesof property; provide for confidentiality of correspondence andtelephone conversations; allow peaceful assembly and demonstrations;protect freedom of expression; and provide for freedom fromcompulsory labor.   Ismail Danish, a former ambassador to Libya, replaces Nur AhmedBarlets as minister of higher education in Najib's Cabinet.   Burhan Gasi, who was higher education minister in a formerCabinet, was chosen to replace Mohammad Khan Jalalar as minister ofcommerce.   Khodaidad Basharmall is the new education minister, ousting AbdulRasul, and Abdullah Baharr succeeds Isaq Kawah as minister of lightindustries and foodstuffs.   Shirjan Mazdorarr, who was transport minister, was picked toreplace Pachqul Wafadarr as civil aviation minister.
