<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-10-0754 </DOCNO><TEXT>A physically-based strategy for the prediction of geomagnetic/ionosphericdisturbances, the Solar-Terrestrial/Environmental Model (STEM 2000),is proposed, with application to the prediction of periods of spacecraftcharging. Synoptic solar observations provide input for MHD models forflare occurrence, propagation of coronal disturbances, and high speedsolar wind streams. A three-dimensional interplanetary MHD model determinessolar wind parameters including the energy flux and the cross-magnetospheretail electric field. Observational earth data are used to predict localtime, high latitude ionospheric disturbances which have an impact onthe ionospheric structure. 21 references.</TEXT></DOC>
