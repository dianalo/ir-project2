In remarks viewed as a softening of her call for anational referendum to override the Senate, Mrs. Aquino urgedsupporters and opponents of the treaty to set aside theirdifferences.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Let us not talk about those things that divide us,&quot; Mrs.Aquino said in a discussion with reporters and pro-treatysenators broadcast late Sunday. Mrs. Aquino said senators onboth sides of the dispute favor U.S. withdrawal and differonly on the timetable. The treaty the Senate rejected lastweek would have extended for 10 years U.S. use of Subic inexchange for $203 million annually, plus trade and aidconcessions.   A presidential spokesman confirmed that Mrs. Aquinofavored a seven-year withdrawal period proposed by protreatysenators. But he said the president could only present such aplan to Washington if it were approved by two-thirds of thePhilippine Senate. Observers said such approval is unlikely.   The spokesman said Mrs. Aquino wouldn't lead the petitiondrive because the constitution says such initiatives shouldoriginate with the people. Once the necessary signatures aregathered, Mrs. Aquino would campaign for public approval, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
