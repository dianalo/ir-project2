The least likely cars to be stolen or broken into are small and mid-sized domestic models. Statistics also showed that thieves most often eye sporty models and ignore station wagons and vans.    According to the insurance industry's Highway Loss Data Institute, two Volkswagen models -- the GTI and the Cabriolet -- have insurance-theft-claim rates nearly 70 times greater than the four-door Mercury Lynx, which has the lowest rate.    The Highway Loss Data Institute, which is part of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, gathers and processes a broad range of insurance-statistical data.    The 11 car models with the highest frequency of thefts were all European models including seven versions of the Volkswagen. The others are two Saab models, the Peugeot 505 and the Porsche 944 Coupe.    &quot;The theft of car radios is a major cause of the high frequency of theft claims of these cars,&quot; the report said.    Insurance experts suggested the thieves' interest in the radios is because of their easy accessibility in many foreign models. &quot;All have a common box,&quot; said Rick Elder, vice president of the insurance group. &quot;They're easily accessible. You can snap them out of one car and easily put them into another. It's a very attractive theft target.&quot;    But when thieves are out to steal an entire car, they are likely to pick sporty models, including a number of U.S. models. The study said sports and speciality cars continued to account &quot;for an overwhelming share of total theft losses.&quot; While these cars account for 15% of the total number of cars insured, they represent 40% of the dollars paid on insurance claims because of theft.    The institute provided no overall figures on the number of thefts or total losses.    Cars with the highest average theft loss were the 1986 Porsche 911 -- $10,620 for each claim compared with an average of $1,985 for all 1986 models -- followed by Chevrolet's Corvette and Camaro.    Among the least likely targets were three Mercury models -- the Lynx, Grand Marquis station wagon and Topaz -- and the Plymouth Colt Vista wagon and Pontiac Sunbird. The cars had the least number of insurance claims because of theft.    Among vans, pickup trucks and utility vehicles, the 1985 Jeep CJ-7 and the 1986 and 1987 Suzuki Samurai had the highest frequency of theft claims. The Chevrolet K-10 Blazer had the highest average theft payment for each claim. Small pickup trucks generally had the lowest theft rate; theft losses for large utility vehicles increased.    Some cars showed sharp changes, either becoming more popular or less popular among thieves, during the three model years covered by the study. Usually the shift was related to a change in design or in some cases improved theft-alarm systems, the report said.    &quot;Theft results of the Chevrolet Corvette were significantly lower for the 1986 model&quot; although the average loss payment was still four times the average for all cars, the study said. It attributed the improvement to a newly designed theft-deterrent system that became available with the 1986 cars.    Meanwhile, theft losses for the Buick Regal and Chevrolet Monte Carlo, both of which adopted a more sporty look in 1987, increased sharply that year. But the report said design changes in the Mazda RX-7 and Toyota Celica resulted in sharply lower theft losses in 1986 and 1987.    Mr. Elder said that may be because the new designs are so fresh that the thieves don't have any market for the parts.    The report tracked theft losses during the first year of availability for the 1987 models cars, the first two years of availability for 1986 models and the first three years of availability for 1985 models. </TEXT></DOC>
