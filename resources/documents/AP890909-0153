(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It sounds like the plot of a steamy novel:dashing doctor finds success and riches in small-town America, leadscharmed life until sex scandal erupts _ and he's in the middle of it.   But it's fact, not fiction in this tranquil town.   The protagonist is Dr. Pravin Thakkar, accused of grossnegligence, lewd conduct, rape and other offenses against more thana dozen women. Many are ex-patients. In some cases, women he datedsay he impregnated them and then performed abortions without theirconsent.   ``We've had lewd and immoral allegations before ... but never inthis volume against one man,'' said Dan Foley, assistant to stateAttorney General Linley Pearson, whose office filed a complaintagainst Thakkar.   Thakkar, whose license has been temporarily suspended, denies thecharges and says he'll be vindicated.   ``You are giving a forum to people who are lying ... (and trying)to cash in,'' he said. ``These are not the facts.''   Jeffrey Lockwood, his attorney, added, ``Many of the allegations,if not all of them, are not worthy of belief.''   Madison County Prosecutor William Lawler says charges involvingfive women and a sixth unrelated accusation will likely be presentedto a grand jury within several weeks.   A 23-count state complaint pending before the Indiana MedicalLicensing Board accuses him of a litany of misconduct, including:prescribing an addictive drug to a patient as long as she would havepelvic exams; fondling patients in the examining room; forcing awoman to have sex in her house; impregnating women, then performingunwanted abortions.   Separate suits and malpractice claims are pending against Thakkar.   He also faces an October trial on charges that he withdrew morethan $132,000 from his bank accounts in a way that allegedly skirtedfederal rules on reporting withdrawals.   Many of Thakkar's accusers came forward at a February state boardhearing that resulted in the temporary suspension of his license. Ahearing on whether to revoke the license has not been scheduled.   One panel member called it ``probably the worst abuse ofphysician-patient trust'' he'd seen. The board called Thakkar ``aclear and immediate danger to the public health and safety.''   ``The commonality of all of their stories was prettyconvincing,'' Foley said.   Since then, the Indianapolis Star reported Thakkar left an Ohiomedical training program in 1980 amid charges he had a sexualencounter with a patient and mishandled a case in which a womanhemorrhaged to death after giving birth.   Court records claim Thakkar left a Texas medical residencyprogram in 1981 after a patient complained he made sexual commentsand was known as a doctor who ``would conduct a pelvic exam for ahead cold.''   Carmen Brutchen Hertzinger, a divorced teacher's aide, claimsThakkar impregnated her in 1983, then pressured her to have anabortion.   ``I said, `No way. I want this baby. I love you,''' she recalled.   When she refused, she claims he drugged her, induced laborwithout her consent and delivered an 8-month-old fetus. She contendsshe heard a cry, but never saw the baby and Thakkar told her it wasstillborn and claimed to have ``six bullets'' to kill her, othersand himself if she revealed what happened.   Ms. Hertzinger has sued Thakkar. He has responded with a slandersuit, claiming she was still pregnant more than a month after thealleged abortion.   ``I think he specifically sought out women who were emotionallyvulnerable,'' said Bonnie Coffey-Myers, who answered a personal adThakkar placed in ``Indianapolis Monthly'' magazine.   ``I was overweight, divorced, raising two kids on my own ...attracting the attention of a healthy, intelligent, wealthy,powerful physician,'' she said. ``It's every woman's dream.''   Ms. Coffey-Myers said after she became pregnant, Thakkar told herhe'd perform an abortion but would have to falsify records becausethe procedure wasn't allowed at the hospital.   Despite the allegations, Thakkar has supporters.   He's ``one of the finest doctors I've ever had,'' Joyce Thompsonwrote in a local newspaper letter. ``He's always been there whenneeded _ taken great care and showed genuine concern for me.''   But Thakkar's lawyer said such support may have little impact.``He's already been tried and convicted in the press,'' Lockwoodsaid, noting some of his client's accusers have made theOprah-Geraldo talk show circuit.   ``A small group of people are getting an awful lot of mediaattention and ... feel they're going to get an awful lot of moneyfrom the doctor.''   Pravin Thakkar, 38, came to this central Indiana town of 2,000 in1981, replacing the only doctor, who had died.   ``He was a congenial sort of person,'' said Gerald Harper, amember of the Lions Club, which organized a doctor-search committee.``He seemed very ... settled in his ways.'' Thakkar was married atthe time and he has a child.   ``He seemed like he cared about whether you were ill and he wouldbe available whenever possible,'' said Betty Janney, clerk-treasurerin nearby Gaston, where he had a part-time practice.   The man who had known poverty in India built a prosperouspractice, earning a reported gross annual income of $500,000.   Some women met him as a patient but Thakkar also placed blind-boxnewspaper and magazine ads _ he met his current fiancee through one_ describing himself as filled with ``dreams, love andamp; sensitivity.''   For some, the 5-foot-6, graying doctor lived up to his claims,wooing women with soft music, sweet words and a soothing manner.   ``It's almost like having a spell put over you,'' Ms. Hertzingersaid.   ``He was like no other man I'd ever met,'' said Kathy Collins,the first to sue Thakkar. ```He was very soft. He was very caring.''   Ms. Collins says she met Thakkar as a patient and after years ofon-and-off dating, became pregnant. When she told him, she says heaborted the fetus without her consent.   ``I hurt so bad inside, I knew I had to do something,'' sheexplained. ``I just knew that I couldn't go on knowing what he didand letting him get away with it.''   Her suit opened the floodgates. Many allegations are severalyears old, raising questions as to why some women waited so long andcontinued to see him as their doctor.   ``If they thought he was a heel ... why did they go back tohim?'' asked Harper of the Lions Club. ``It just don't make sense.''   Some of the women cited financial reasons. Coffey-Myers saidThakkar agreed to do her tubal ligation for whatever fee herinsurance would cover.   Some feared they wouldn't be believed challenging a doctor.``Once they saw others coming forward, (they thought) if they bandedtogether with other folks, maybe something would be done,'' addedFoley, the attorney general's aide.   Today, they have mixed feelings about Thakkar.   ``My attitude ranges from pity to hatred,'' said Ms.Coffey-Myers. ``Perhaps some of us were naive and gave him thebenefit of the doubt too many times. That doesn't mean any of usdeserved what we got. I feel much the same way a rape victim does.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regional reporter,based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, Sept. 11</NOTE></DOC>
