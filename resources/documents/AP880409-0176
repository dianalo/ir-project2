ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Robert Campeau has visions of turningBloomingdale's _ the star division of Federated Department StoresInc. _ into a national chain after he takes the retailer over.There are fewer shopping centers being built these days, butindustry analysts say Campeau can still accomplish his goal.   At a news conference in New York this past week, Campeau, thechairman of the Toronto-based developer, Campeau Corp., said hewants to expand Bloomingdale's after he completes his acquisitionof Federated. The New York-based chain, one of the hottest names inretailing, has 17 stores, mostly in the East.   But with approximately 1,500 large malls across the country _those with more than 400,000 square feet and at least two``anchors,'' or major stores _ the potential for expansion throughnew shopping malls is limited.   ``They've just filled the country with the things,'' said FredWintzer, an analyst with the investment firm Alex. Brown andamp; SonsInc. in Baltimore. ``There isn't room for a lot of malls.''   In the heyday of mall construction in the early 1970s, mallswere being built at a rate of about 35 a year, said John Chapman,research director of the International Council of Shopping Centers,a trade organization.   Today, that's down to about 25 a year, he said.   Demographics dictate how many malls will be built, and where.When the population of an area begins to swell, mall developersbegin to build.   During the boom in the oil patch in the late 1970s and early'80s, store chains expanded and malls were built in Texas andOklahoma.   Today, the Washington D.C. area is ripe for expansion, Wintzersaid, noting that two new malls are being constructed in McLean,Va., right next to an existing center.   But in areas where there already are a number of malls, adeveloper can still build, as long as he constructs a dynamic,exciting mall.   ``He's going to put up a much better mousetrap, with betteranchors'' to entice away business from more stodgy competitors,Wintzer said.   Developers also are building in what Wintzer called``second-tier markets,'' such as Allentown, Pa., or Sheboygan,Wis., which are smaller metropolitan areas.   Thomas Tashjian, an analyst with the investment firm SeidlerAmdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles, cited California and Texas _despite the latter's recent economic slump _ as other markets fornew malls.   If Campeau wants to open stores in those two states, he likelywould have to do so through new malls. He has agreed to sellFederated's Bullock's stores in California and its Foley divisionin Texas.   Campeau could use Bloomingdale's as an anchor in malls he mightbuild. But analysts say his ownership of stores like Bloomingdale'salso will give Campeau leverage in malls being planned by otherdevelopers.   Bloomingdale's would attract to a new mall the other retailersthat a developer needs. Campeau might use his chain as a bargainingchip to ``get a piece of the action'' in another developer's mall.   There also are ways for Campeau to expand his chain without newmalls.   ``He can take some of the space in existing department storesand renovate it into a Bloomingdale's,'' said Tashjian.   Campeau's expected focus on a Bloomingdale's expansion reflectsthe fact that many department stores have little growth potential.   Bloomingdale's and stores like the Seattle-based Nordstrom chainare perceived as unique and different, Wintzer said. But otherdepartment stores, such as Filene's in the Northeast, are not knownoutside of their region.   ``Those kind of operators will have a difficult time moving intocities where they don't have a presence,'' he said.   The Campeau story was not the only retail takeover news thispast week.   F.W. Woolworth Co., the nation's 11th largest retailer, said ithad been notified that Dart Group Corp. planned to buy asubstantial amount of its stock. Analysts expect Dart _ which has astring of unsuccessful takeover attempts behind it _ to make a bidfor Woolworth.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
