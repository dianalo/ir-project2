(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A monthlong search for the last threecrossbred dusky seaside sparrows, which had escaped from captivityduring a storm, revealed no traces of the birds, and ornithologistsare convinced the species is extinct.   The quest by federal biologists ended Wednesday, two years to theday after the death of the last known pure dusky seaside sparrow, asmall brown-and-white bird with a short buzzing trill.   ``You can't come to any other conclusion because there's nohabitat around here for them,'' said Herb Kale, vice president forornithology at the Florida Audubon Society.   By the 1950s, the birds' salt marsh habitat near the St. JohnsRiver in central Florida was rapidly being consumed by development.Pesticides sprayed to control mosquitoes also hurt the birds.   In 1966, the dusky seaside sparrow became the first species onthe federal government's endangered species list.   Kale became an adviser to a Disney World program that had triedsince 1983 to mate the crossbred birds with a related species.   But that program was devastated in March, when a storm pitched apalm frond through the fiberglass roof of the birds' compound andleft a hole. When keepers arrived the next morning, they found onecrossbred sparrow dead and two others gone.   Another stayed in its cage during the storm, but flew off whenkeepers tried to put it in a more secure cage.   The birds were born in captivity. They knew their natural saltmarsh habitat only through careful recreations, so the birds arepresumed dead.   The federal government bought the 6,000-acre St. Johns RiverNational Wildlife Refuge in Brevard County to protect the species in1972.   ``Some would argue that we lost a scientific opportunity to learnsomething, although we've had those birds in captivity a fairly longtime and learned about everything we could,'' said Don Wood,endangered species coordinator for the Florida Game and Fresh WaterFish Commission.   ``In an ecological sense, it's an absolutely totallyinsignificant loss,'' Wood said. ``In the philosophical sense, itwould depend on whoever's talking to you.''   One last aerial survey of the salt marshes might be made today.   But if no dusky sparrow is found, paperwork will be filed to haveit removed from the federal endangered species list because it isextinct.</TEXT></DOC>
