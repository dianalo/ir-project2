They also warned of a``slow and quiet massacre'' of their hostages if their demands werenot met.   A flight engineer said the hijackers, who are demanding therelease of 17 pro-Iranian terrorists imprisoned in Kuwait, hadstarted to ``hurt'' one of the passengers.   It is believed there are still 53 people aboard the KuwaitAirways Boeing 747, including three members of Kuwait's rulingAl-Sabah family and at least six hijackers.   In Lebanon, a pro-Iranian group threatened to kill kidnappedAmerican and French hostages if any attempt was made to storm theplane.   A statement from the Islamic Jihad terrorist group was deliveredto the Reuters news agency in west Beirut, along with photographsof journalists Terry A. Anderson, an American, and Jean-PaulKauffmann of France.   ``To the families of the hostages, we declare that we shallexecute the Western captives in Lebanon if the plane and holywarriors (hijackers) aboard are subjected to any militaryfoolhardiness,'' the statement said.   In Cyprus, the Arab hijackers, who have killed one passengersince seizing the plane Tuesday, threatened to kill their captives,but a noon deadline passed without any additional slayings.   One minute before a second deadline expired four hours later,the engineer, relaying the hijackers' messages to Larnaca Airportcontrol tower, said: ``They've already started to hurt one of thepassengers.'' He gave no details.   Later, the hijackers offered to free 20 of the passengers inreturn for fuel, but that was rejected at Kuwait's insistence.   Negotiators talked with the hijackers for 20 minutes late Sundayand Cypriot government spokesman Akis Fantis said, ``There was animportant contact right now, and by tomorrow morning we shall knowthe result that we would hope to be what we wish to have.''   ``It's the same offer always, the release of the hostages forfuel,'' he said. ``There is no change in the offer. We want thehostages to be released, then we refuel. But there is a newelement, not changing the offer, but maybe changing theirattitudes. The element is good and gives a certain hope and that'sall.''   Fantis did not elaborate and when asked about the mood of thehijackers he said, ``They wished us a good night.'' He then wasasked about the possibility of police action and he replied, ``Nocomment.''   In a morning statement, one of the hijackers told the controltower, ```We hereby re-announce our refueling request due to ourintention to (go to) Kuwait, the concerned country. And if Kuwaitrefuses us, a crash landing will take place on the ... prince'spalace.''   Speaking in broken English, he urged Cypriot authorities to sendfuel to prevent ``the slow and quiet massacre taking place in thiscountry.''   Sunday night, the hijackers put on the radio a man they said wasFadel Khaled Al-Sabah, a member of Kuwait's extensive rulingfamily. In a faint voice, the man recited a verse from the Koran,Islam's holy book, saying ``we depend on God for our fate.   The tower asked: ``Is that it?'' One of the hijackers replied:``Yes, that's it because he's sick.''   The hijacker said the man could not hold down food and wasvomiting. Asked if a doctor was needed, the hijacker said he wouldadvise the tower Monday morning.   Senior Palestine Liberation Organization officials in Cyprus metwith the hijackers four times Sunday. The PLO is believed to be akey factor in negotiations.   The plane landed in Larnaca on Friday. Flight 422 wascommandeered Tuesday en route to Kuwait from Bangkok with 112people aboard and forced to land in Mashhad in northeastern Iran,where 57 people were released.   The jet left Iran and landed in Larnaca after being refusedpermission to land in Lebanon and Syria. Another captive, an ailing32-year-old Kuwaiti, was freed in Larnaca, apparently after PLOintervention.   On Saturday, the hijackers killed a 24-year-old Kuwaiti policeborder guard aboard the plane. His body was tossed onto the tarmacafter the Cypriots refused to refuel the jet.   Fantis said Sunday that marks on the man's body indicated he hadbeen badly beaten 18 to 24 hours before his death.   Between meetings with PLO officials, several hijackers wearingblue hoods ripped out inflatable orange escape chutes inside thejet and dumped them on the tarmac.   Then they demanded that ground staff remove the chutes so theywould not obstruct the plane.   At 3 p.m., the engineer radioed the tower: ``If (the hijackers)don't get a positive response in one hour and 15 minutes regardingfuel and services, they will start hurting occupants of theaircraft.'''   When the tower urged the hijackers to free sick passengers, theengineer replied: ``Negative.''   One of the hijackers said they would release their captivesimmediately if the 17 pro-Iranian extremists, convicted in Kuwaitfor bombing the U.S. and French embassies there in December 1983,were freed. Cypriot officials said the Kuwaitis refused.   The nationalities and identities of the hijackers have not beendisclosed. Released passengers said they spoke Arabic with aLebanese accent.   But their demand for the release of the 17 men, all but oneShiite Moslems, imprisoned in Kuwait is identical to that made byShiite extremists holding two Americans and at least threeFrenchmen hostage in Lebanon.   The American hostages are Anderson, 40, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, and Thomas Sutherland, 56,acting dean of agriculture at the American University of Beirut.Both were kidnapped in 1985 by the Islamic Jihad.   The Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, is linked to Lebanon'sHezbollah, or Party of God. The PLO is allied in Lebanon withHezbollah, a fundamentalist Shiite movement with strong links toIran's revolutionary government.</TEXT></DOC>
