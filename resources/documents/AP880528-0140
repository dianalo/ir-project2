That theme was heard often during the two weeks of floor debateon the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, ratifiedFriday by a 93-5 vote, and is likely to continue for any futurearms agreements.   ``The Senate has clearly made visible that it is an equalpartner with any president in the making of treaties,'' said SenateMajority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va. ``And I hope that will be asobering impact on this president and Mr. Gorbachev when they sitdown and discuss another agreement.''   White House chief of staff Howard H. Baker Jr., who left withthe treaty Saturday to join President Reagan in Helsinki, said theratified pact indicated a ``new spirit of bipartisan cooperation''between the president and Congress.   ``The president, I believe, has shown his dedication to peace,his dedication to strength, his dedication to see he leaves alegacy of a better world and a safer world at the end of his eightyears as president,'' Baker told reporters at Andrews Air ForceBase.   There will be a ceremonial exchange of the treaty documents inMoscow on Wednesday, and Baker said the exchange signaled ``ahistoric improvement of the relationship of the two superpowers ofthe world.''   The INF pact ``in a lot of ways, was a stalking horse forSTART,'' said Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, referring to theproposed Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.   Both Cohen and Byrd noted that the INF was closely scrutinizedby three different committees. If the Senate learned anything fromits work on the treaty, Byrd said, ``it is that we have to ask alot of questions, that we have to look very closely.''   ``We were very deliberative, we were very thorough and I believethat we have improved this treaty,'' said Byrd. ``I think we'veclosed all the loopholes we know about in this treaty and it's amuch better treaty than when it was sent'' to Capitol Hill.   Byrd had pulled the INF treaty off the Senate's calendar due toquestions that were raised about whether the Soviet Union intendedto comply with all verification provisions.   ``I resisted the pressure to bring up this treaty until thefaults could be corrected,'' said Byrd. ``The administration'snegotiators went back to Geneva and corrected those faults. It isnow a better treaty than it ever was before.''   Cohen agreed, noting, ``I think that in some ways, we improvedthe treaty. We tied down some loose ends that perhaps could havecaused trouble if we hadn't cleared them up.''   But, Cohen asked, ``if we had this much debate and trouble on atreaty like INF, just imagine what would happen if we get a STARTtreaty.''   He noted that the INF pact was relatively straightforward andinvolved only a small percentage of each superpower's atomicarsenal. By contrast, a START agreement would reduce arsenals by 50percent and would require far more extensive verificationprovisions. It would thus permit far more opportunities to cheat.   The biggest fight over the INF pact stemmed from a fight betweenPresident Reagan and the Democratic-controlled Congress over the1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Reagan asserts that his administration has the legal authorityto change the U.S. interpretation of the 1972 pact, a move thatwould permit expanded tests of Reagan's Star Wars anti-missilesystem. Congressional Democrats dispute that claim.   The Senate approved an amendment to the INF ratificationresolution banning any future president from re-intepreting thepact unless Congress first approves.   ``What we learned from that is that you have to be very careful,you have to be very sure, when you ratify a treaty,'' said Sen. SamNunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a chiefcritic of the proposed change in the ABM pact.   Byrd said the anti-interpretation amendment is ``a clear signalto the administration, future administrations and the Soviets ...that this Senate will not roll over and play dead ... and is not arubber stamp to any president.''   But the suggestion that the Senate was an equal partner with thepresident in the making of treaties brought a different responsefrom Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.   ``This is one of the most serious constitutional issues to comebefore this body in a long time ... we are trampling on theConstitution,'' he said.   Reagan submitted the INF pact to the Senate on Jan. 25,beginning an exhaustive review of the treaty by the ForeignRelations, Armed Services and Intelligence committee.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said the scrutinyprovided a ``model of how we should perform our role to advise andconsent to treaties. I think this the most closely examined armscontrol treaty in history.''   But Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., a critic of the INF pact,continually decried what he termed ``this rush to judgment.''   The INF pact was on the Senate floor for nine days, a farshorter time than previous treaties, Helms noted.   ``I think that any future treaty should be examined much moreclosely, in much greater detail, than we have done with thistreaty. Our work here may well come back to haunt us,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
