What happens then depends largely on world oil demand,which is expected to increase, and on the ability of Iraq toexport petroleum.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;One of the major problems OPEC will face will be thereturn of Iraq and Kuwait in the market,&quot; Jean Ping, Gabon'soil minister, told reporters.   Except for a small quantity it is allowed to send toJordan, Iraq is prohibited from exporting oil by the UnitedNations' sanctions imposed against it when the Persian Gulfcrisis began.   In an interview, Osama A.R. Al-Hiti, Iraq's new oilminister, said that once the U.N. ban is lifted, oilproduction and exports should rise swiftly. &quot;Immediately, wecan pump 700,000 barrels a day through the Iraqi line inTurkey,&quot; he said, &quot;and that will climb to one million barrelsa day in one month.&quot;   Currently, Iraq is producing 450,000 to 500,000 barrels aday, Mr. Al-Hiti said. That is enough to satisfy domesticconsumption and provide some 55,000 barrels a day to Jordan.Before the Persian Gulf crisis, Iraq produced 3.1 millionbarrels a day, its OPEC quota, and exported most of the oil.A resumption of exports in significant quantities wouldsuggest others in OPEC will have to make room in world oilmarkets by reducing their output.   Obviously the big adjustment would be left to Saudi Arabiaand oil officials of that leading exporter have already madeclear that it will maintain output around its current levelof eight million barrels a day rather than returning to thepre-crisis output of 5.4 million barrels a day.   Still, Mr. Al-Hiti appears optimistic that the group's oilministers will make room for Iraq when the time comes. &quot;Myfeeling is that they are all willing to accept the fact wewill be back in the market,&quot; said Mr. Al-Hiti. &quot;That's why weagreed to meet again in September.&quot;   The oil ministers concluded their oneday conferenceTuesday with an agreement to hold production flat for anotherthree months and then review the outlook for the fourthquarter.   In news conferences and interviews yesterday, several oilministers said Iraq and Kuwait, whose oil wells were severelydamaged by Iraqi forces, have a right to return to old quotasof 3.1 million and 1.5 million barrels a day, respectively,as soon as they are able.   &quot;They are to let us know so we can decide how to adjustproduction in order not to flood the market,&quot; said JibrilAminu, Nigeria's oil mininster.   Kuwait is expected to be much slower than Iraq in resumingproduction. Its first new production, about 50,000 barrels aday, is likely this month or next.   In Iraq's case, said Mr. Al-Hiti, the target is to returnto production equal to its OPEC quota in next year's secondhalf. He conceded however that this depends on a quick end tothe U.N. sanctions and on Iraq's ability to repair itsdamaged oil installations.</TEXT></DOC>
