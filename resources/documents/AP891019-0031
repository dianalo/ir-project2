The poverty rate fell from 13.4 percent in 1987 to 13.1 percentlast year, and the number of impoverished people declined from 32.3million to 31.9 million, the Census Bureau reported Wednesday. Butit said neither change was big enough to be statisticallysignificant.   Robert Greenstein of the private Center on Budget and PolicyPriorities said the report ``provides disturbing evidence of theunevenness of the (economic) recovery.''   ``Its economic benefits are disproportionately going to those atthe top of the income spectrum and missing many at the bottom,'' hesaid.   The poorest fifth of the population received 4.6 percent oftotal national family income in 1988, the lowest percentage since1954, while the richest fifth received 44 percent, the highest everrecorded, he said.   The Census Bureau, however, chose to highlight a 1.7 percentjump in real per capita income last year, to a new high of $13,120.Blacks made bigger gains than whites, but still lagged far behind.   Income for whites rose 1.5 percent to $13,900. Income for blacksincreased 3.9 percent to $8,270 and the figure for Hispanics wasvirtually unchanged at $7,960.   ``It's a year basically in which most groups stayed the same orimproved,'' said William Butz, the agency's associate director fordemographics.   Greenstein said the per capita income figures are averages thatwere pulled up by big gains for the richest Americans. He saidmedian household income showed no significant gains overall,registering $27,230 in 1988, up from $27,140 a year earlier afteradjusting for the rise in consumer prices.   Diana Pearce, director of the non-profit Women and PovertyProject, said the census report contained troubling new evidencethat women are being left behind. For example, she said, 53 percentof poor families in 1988 were headed by women alone, the highestproportion on record.   ``We are once again experiencing the feminization of poverty,''she said.   The annual release of the poverty report once again revived thedebate over the accuracy of the Census Bureau's figures.   The conservative Heritage Foundation said Census overstates theextent of poverty and underestimates the financial well-being ofmillions of Americans.   ``The 1988 Census data, though still deficient, thus show steadyand significant improvement for most Americans,'' said Kate WalshO'Beirne, a visiting fellow at Heritage.   Census for the first time this year issued an alternative set ofpoverty figures based on an experimental price index that it saidwas more accurate.   The alternate numbers _ published in an appendix to the officialreport _ would cut the poverty rate for 1988 by 1.5 percentagepoints to 11.6 percent and reduce by 3.6 million the number ofpeople classified as living in poverty.   The congressional Joint Economic Committee criticized thosealternate figures as inaccurate and issued a report saying if thepoverty rate were calculated by what it said were more realisticmethods, the figures would be far higher.   For example, while the official Census figure for 1987 was 13.5percent, two better methods of calculation would have put thepoverty rate at 16.1 percent or 24.1 percent in 1987, the committeesaid.   ``This study indicates poverty is not declining. Rather, moreAmericans are poor today than at any time since the 1960s,'' thecommittee said in a statement.</TEXT></DOC>
