In recent weeks, three of New Jersey's five largest bank holding companies have struck merger agreements with out-of-state banks eager to share in New Jersey's booming economy. The most recent announcement came yesterday as Britain's largest bank holding company, National Westminster Bank PLC, announced it would acquire First Jersey National Corp., a $4.4 billion Jersey City-based bank holding company, for $82 a share, or $820 million -- a hefty premium over the bank's book value.    New Jersey's vibrant economy has spurred skyrocketing growth in the price of real estate, and a rush to develop that is reminiscent of the Florida land booms and the western gold strikes.    Land along Route 78, a new U.S. highway that veers west toward Pennsylvania, has risen to as much as $500,000 an acre from as little as $20,000 an acre a few years back. In Princeton, near the center of the state, Sam Rieder andamp; Sons, a local developer, announced plans for a 500 acre, $1 billion office park development last month without having signed any tenants.    Randy Wright, Rieder's vice president for marketing, says: &quot;150 of the Fortune 500 companies are represented near Princeton. I'm looking for the other 350.&quot;    And in the north, there has been a rapid succession of projects to entice New York companies and residents who are fed up with high costs, high rent, high taxes, shortages of space and power and long commuting times.    &quot;We think the (New Jersey) communities close to New York will have a generation of gentrification and economic upturn and rebuilding,&quot; says Leonard Stern, chairman of Hartz Group Inc., one of the biggest developers in the northern part of the state. &quot;Whoever can play in the game at an early date is going to play in one of the great economic miracles in the country.&quot;    Even discounting some of that as hyperbole, New Jersey is clearly on the upswing. Unemployment, at 4.2%, is one-third less than the national average.    The number of incorporations, at 33,000 last year, is up from 21,000 in 1980. And more than 1,000 foreign companies -- once almost the exclusive province of New York -- have located in the state.    &quot;I don't see New Jersey's economy (cooling off) for quite a while,&quot; says Thomas J. Stanton, chairman and chief executive officer of First Jersey. He predicts that out-of-state institutions won't be disappointed with their acquisitions.    Helping to fuel New Jersey's economic boom has been an exodus of financial service jobs from Manhattan. PaineWebber Group Inc., Bankers Trust Co. and Peat Marwick are among the firms that have found that it is cheaper to locate back-office and computer operations on the other side of the river. &quot;We've been to the top 50 users of space on Wall Street,&quot; says Barry Nealon, managing director of Jones Lang Wootton, which is developing a $900 million office and retail project overlooking the Hudson River in Jersey City. &quot;Nearly everyone says they are thinking of reconfiguring space.&quot;    New York is fighting back. Recently, New York Mayor Edward Koch posed for advertisements in which he was shown boarding up the Holland Tunnel to stop companies from fleeing the city to New Jersey. Beyond such commercials, the city is aggressively promoting tax and other incentives to keep companies in the city's outer boroughs, if not in Manhattan. But some of the suburban, life-style and cost advantages of New Jersey cannot be matched in the boroughs.    Another reason for the state's economic surge is that the old image of New Jersey no longer fits the bill. The state has one of the toughest sets of environmental protection laws in the country. It is home to the Super Bowl champion &quot;New York&quot; Giants football team, and it is no longer without a television station.    Developer Harry Grant's proposal to revive blighted Newark with a 121-story office building -- topping everything in Manhattan -- sounds like a New Jersey joke, and it will probably never be much more. But the state's plan for a $200 million arts center in Newark, rivaling New York's Lincoln Center, has a good chance of making it.    New Jersey's 7.6 million residents make it the most densely populated state in the union. It has 1,013 people per square mile, compared with a national average of 67 people per square mile.    Its labor force is highly educated. With 140,000 engineers and scientists, state officials say it has more of such workers per capita than any other state. They have spawned a major corridor of research and development industries fanning out from the area of Princeton University.    The other reason for the boom is that oldest of real estate saws, location. &quot;You have a market of 60 million people within an overnight's drive,&quot; says Mr. LeFevre, the state official. &quot;There's no other market like that in the country.&quot;    Hartz's Mr. Stern was one of the first to bet on the benefits of New Jersey's access to markets and communications of the Northeast and low costs compared with New York. The owner of a pet food company, he &quot;went across the river&quot; in 1966 to escape New York's taxes and costs. &quot;It didn't take very long to figure out that the economics that attracted me would be common to others,&quot; he says.    Mr. Stern, along with Gene Heller, the broker who found him space, set up a development company that now controls 30 million square feet in northern Jersey. &quot;It's like participating in the sixth borough of New York,&quot; Mr. Stern says.    There is some concern, however, that the boom in real estate may be overdone. Office vacancy rates throughout the state are higher than 20%. Mr. Heller, who is now the head of Hartz's real estate subsidiary, says he thinks &quot;prices have gone insane&quot; in the less-populated inland areas of the state.    &quot;Developers are out buying farmland in lots of little places with funny names,&quot; he says. &quot;I think there is a lot of overbuilding.&quot;    Meanwhile, the influx of businesses lured by Hartz and others causes bankers' pulses to quicken. More companies translate into growth in deposits and wider margins on loans for New Jersey banks and fatter bottom lines.    And there's more to the surge in mergers of New Jersey banks than just the economy. Starting next January, New Jersey banking laws permit banks from New York and other states to acquire New Jersey banks. That prospect has bankers searching out deals at a frenzied pace.    Bruce Chodash, executive vice president at Ryan, Beck andamp; Co., a New Jersey investment banking firm, says, &quot;The question for these New Jersey banks is: Do you want to be a survivor or get swallowed up? In the end, you'll see fewer institutions controlling a larger percentage of the assets. It will be just like what happened in the southeastern states a couple of years ago when they opened up&quot; to intraregional banking.    The pickings already have gotten pretty slim. The three largest New Jersey banking concerns -- First Fidelity Bancorp., Midlantic Corp., and United Jersey Banks -- have struck deals with Pennsylvania banks, thereby putting them beyond the range of New York banks for several years. The fourth, First Jersey National, is to be acquired by National Westminster, and the fifth, Horizon Bancorp., has an agreement with Chemical New York Corp. to be acquired early next year. </TEXT></DOC>
