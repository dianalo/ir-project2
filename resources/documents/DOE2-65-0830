Economicsizes for battery and CAES can be small (10 to 200 MW). Pumped storageand SMES are typically up to 1000 MW for economy of scale. The smallerprojects offer modularity and short construction lead time. The largerprojects are more efficient in operation. Traditionally, system plannersevaluate a new energy technology by comparing it with an alternativeand established option that serves the same type of electric load. Energystorage primarily serves the peaking load. It is usually compared tocombustion turbines for energy benefit and capacity benefit. This approachfails to capture other significant inherent benefits of energy storage.This paper describes some of these other benefits and the methodologydeveloped in an EPRI-funded research.</TEXT></DOC>
