The Soviet president's unscripted remark, made in a speechto the Japanese Diet, or parliament, marked the clearest signso far that Moscow is eager to settle the contentious issue.</LP><TEXT>   After his speech, Mr. Gorbachev plunged into two hours ofprivate talks with Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu onthe question of four islands known as the South Kuriles inthe Soviet Union and the Northern Territories in Japan. Thetwo leaders agreed to extend their discussion, described by aSoviet spokesman as &quot;serious and sometimes sharp,&quot; into anunscheduled fourth round of talks today.   There are no indications Mr. Gorbachev has offered any newinitiative designed to end the dispute. Rather, he seems tobe searching for a formula to demonstrate Soviet good willand improve chances of resolving the issue at a later date.   A news blackout has been imposed by both sides until themeeting ends. But Japanese media reported late Wednesday thata final communique will state that the two nations, whilestill differing on the islands, have agreed to continuehigh-level talks aimed at bridging the gap.   Mr. Gorbachev used vague language that shed little lighton his intentions. &quot;I believe the outcome {of the talks withMr. Kaifu} and over a dozen documents we are to sign will beclear evidence that Moscow and Tokyo are taking a resolutestep toward a full understanding between the two countriesand a final settlement of the issues the war has left behind-- including the most difficult problem of territorialdemarcation.&quot;   Nevertheless, his remark was seized upon by Soviet andJapanese officials as representing a potential turning point.The four islands, situated just north of Hokkaido, wereoccupied by the Red Army as World War II ended and all theJapanese residents were evicted. The Kremlin has dismissedJapanese demands for return of the territory and even refusedto talk about the islands as an issue that should affectbilateral relations with Japan. For its part, Japan has beendeeply reluctant to extend the sort of economic aid andinvestment that Moscow badly needs to shore up its collapsingeconomy until the issue is settled.   While Mr. Gorbachev's comment may appear obtuse, it hasprovided the only high point to date in an otherwiselackluster meeting. Prior to the trip, Soviet officialsdescribed the four-day visit as a &quot;watershed.&quot; But the Sovietpresident has been accorded a cool, albeit polite, receptionthat contrasts sharply with the enthusiastic welcome hereceived on visits to Germany and the U.S.   There are few signs of &quot;Gorbymania&quot; in Tokyo, thoughcurious crowds did gather to shake his hand Tuesday when hejumped out of his limousine to greet people. His reception atthe parliament was also lukewarm, even though he went out ofhis way to praise Japan's &quot;indomitable spirit of hard work,inexhaustible talents and traditional discipline.&quot; Perhapsmore significantly, he failed to impress a lunchtime audienceof Japanese business executives with his impassioned plea formore investment, particularly in Siberia, a vast area of richnatural resources.   Executives who took part in the lunch Wednesday said theyremain noncommittal about increasing business with the SovietUnion until the territorial question has been resolved. &quot;Hetalked about all kinds of issues -- the development ofnatural resources, tourism and other possibilities,&quot; saidRokuro Ishikawa, chairman of Japan's Chamber of Commerce andIndustry. &quot;But the precondition for that is the resolution ofexisting political problems between Japan and the SovietUnion.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev, he added, &quot;expects a lot from Japan.&quot;   Other business executives were more critical. Thepresident of a regional bank from northern Japan who travelsfrequently to the Soviet Union on business said some membersof the audience had even fallen asleep during thepresentation. &quot;It wasn't a very powerful performance,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. Gorbachev's political initiatives also seemed to fallflat. During his speech in parliament, and in talks withJapanese officials, he called for establishment of amultinational forum designed to ease military tensions andpromote cooperation in Asia. To set such a forum in motion,he proposed that Japan, the Soviet Union, China, India andthe U.S. hold preparatory talks.   The idea was an elaboration of proposals the Soviet leaderhas made before, notably in his speeches in the Pacific portcity of Vladivostok in 1986, and later in Krasnoyarsk. ButJapan quickly poured cold water on the notion.   A senior Foreign Ministry official said Mr. Kaifu hadgiven Mr. Gorbachev several reasons why Tokyo was reluctantto support the initiative. Among other things, Mr. Kaifu saidJapan felt it was important to deal with specific problems,rather than vague plans for broad cooperation, the officialsaid.   In his speech, Mr. Gorbachev also called for directmilitary talks between Moscow and Tokyo, saying he had madeconcrete proposals on the issue. But the Japanese ForeignMinistry official said there had been no mention of any suchbilateral talks during the negotiations. And while Mr.Gorbachev talked about reducing Soviet armaments in Asia, Mr.Kaifu quizzed him about the recent movement of tanks andother military machinery to the Asian part of the SovietUnion, apparently in violation of an agreement on reducingconventional arms signed last November.</TEXT></DOC>
