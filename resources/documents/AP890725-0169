The protesters gathered at the annual meeting of Evans Inc.,waving signs with pictures of wounded animals and slogans such as``Buy a fur and slip into something dead.''   Evans company policy is not to comment on such protests, butRandall Barberis, vice president of marketing, said the animalrights movement has had no effect on business.   Evans reported a loss of $3.8 million in fiscal 1989 on sales of$148 million and the industry has seen two straight off years.   An analyst attributed the performance to mild winters thatlowered demand and lower pelt prices, which reduced the cost offurs to consumers.   Evans earlier this month reported a first-quarter loss forfiscal 1990 of $2.28 million, on sales of $16.5 million, comparedwith a loss of $2.32 million on sales of $14.7 million in the samequarter a year ago.   ``I think the fur industry is drying up,'' said a woman whocalled herself Mink Stole and said she was an actress and member ofthe Washington-based People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.   ``We are making fur look unfashionable and stupid,'' the womansaid. ``Fur caters to vanity, so if we hurt vanity people won't buyit.''   But an analyst disputed the effects of the animal rightsmovement on the industry's performance.   ``It is impossible to quantify any effect that any anti-furmovement has had,'' said Linda Baker, an analyst withPrudential-Bache Securities in New York.   ``The anti-fur movement has become fairly visible, but also theretailers have recognized that and the fur industry, which istraditionally very fragmented, has organized to neutralize theanti-fur movement with education.''   This year actually should be a good year for consumers who wantto buy a fur, because pelt prices have declined slightly again,meaning the price of a finished fur product should be lower, Ms.Baker said.   Evans also sees a better year ahead, Barberis said.   ``I think it is fair to say that, because of those reasons, thelast couple of years have been tough in selling furs, but we thinkthat there is every reason to be optimistic in coming years interms of selling furs to consumers,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
