 The G(UI) and otherreligious controversies intervened in my last column, but now I return tokeep my promise.andP;  You want colors, I got colors.andM;Let me say immediately that my successful and mortgage-paying AutobodySupplies Inventory System (ABSINS) package has been handling for many yearsthe trickiest inventory control problems, namely the stocking, mixing, andretailing of aleph-1 shades of auto paint.andP;  However, I have only recentlystarted delving into the myriad advantages of dappled screens.andP;  ABSINS, amultiuser system running on the Alphamicro, handles inter alia the transfersof bases and toners needed to dispense, say, a gallon of Skyblue for a 1943Chevy, but the programs and terminals are strictly mono.andM;My new source of inspiration is a wonderful book, Using Computer ColorEffectively: An Illustrated Guide by Lisa Thorell and Wanda Smith, [1]sponsored by Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Although Hewlett-Packard's colorful productsare featured, the book is definitely not a piece of corporate propaganda.andO;Indeed, competitive systems are shown and discussed where appropriate.andP;  Thisbook is highly recommended for everyone involved in user-interface design andimplementation.andM;After admiring the profusion of excellently rendered color plates, my overallimpression during my first pass through the book was that the entire subjectof color (computer color in particular) is far more complex than I hadimagined.andP;  Although every physical aspect of visible light can be measuredprecisely in wavelengths, candelas, lumens, lamberts, and the like, the vitalpsychological aspects of color perception, such as hue and saturation, areless easily tamed and tabulated.andP;  I especially like the lambert, which is thecentimeter grams per second unit of luminance equal to one candela per squarecentimeter.andP;  The book, alas, provides no biographical explanation for thisunit.andM;The lambert honors the German-French philosopher-scientist Johann HeinrichLambert (1728-77), who, like Newton, combined analytical mathematical talentswith a flair for optical experimentation.andP;  Measuring these subjectiveattributes and relating them to physical properties has engaged many branchesof science in the last 100 years.andP;  Many known anomalies can confuse us.andP;  Forexample, apparent brightness, as judged by our eye-brain partnership, doesnot vary linearly with the real intensity given by the number of photonsreaching our retinas.andP;  Similarly, the useful red-green-blue (RGB) model,based on the three different types of cone in the eye, does not explain allthe color effects we seem to experience.andM;Experiments tend to be conducted in laboratories, where the many viewingvariables can be more closely controlled.andP;  Ironically, humans behave andperceive differently when they are unobserved and working normally.andP;  Thevariations in visual acuity between subjects, and even with the same subjectas the tests proceed, add to the difficulty.andM;As with all mensuration involving people, the design of the experiment andsubsequent statistical analysis demands great care.andP;  Social and behavioralstudies are notorious for expensively proving what is patently obvious toall.andP;  I am reminded of the lengthy study of Manhattan pedestrian behaviorthat eventually concluded that most people walk on the crowded side of thestreet.andM;Nevertheless, Thorell and Smith report many useful, unobvious results fromyears of color perception tests.andP;  In various tracking and searching trials,for example, they established color as the single most important cue forspeed and accuracy: &quot;A survey of 42 human factors engineering studiesexamining the effects of highlighting on visual performance...shows thatcolor is superior to brightness, shape, underlining, and other forms ofcoding.&quot;andP;  Deciding the best colors for a given application, however, is noteasy.andP;  The focal colors (red, blue, green, and yellow) prove to be the mostuseful for coding information that needs to be remembered.andP;  This result hasbeen verified over a wide range of populations (both human and lowerprimates) and age groups.andM;Interestingly, even &quot;primitive&quot; languages, having only four different wordsfor color, usually include these focal colors, presumably from theinescapable presence and importance of blood, sky, chlorophyll, and the sun.andM;In choosing symbol and text colors for emotional impact, it is easy to assumesuch &quot;intuitive&quot; mappings as &quot;red for danger,&quot; &quot;green for safety,&quot; and so on.andO;Tables 1 and 2 (adapted from Thorell and Smith) indicate that the emotionalconnotations of colors vary considerably by national culture and withincultures by occupation.andP;  Hard coding your own color prejudices may jeopardizeyour export market!andP;  Considering the number of word processors that now colorcode text to indicate italics, bold, and other typographical nuances, thequestion of legibility also deserves attention.andM;Similarly, if you are designing menus, windows, and dialog boxes, you willwant to use color as a help, not a hindrance.andP;  Thorell and Smith devoteseveral chapters to this problem.andP;  One experimental result that crops upfrquently but is hard to quantify is that exuberant palettes areself-defeating.andP;  Excessive rainbow splashes may attract attention in theshowroom, but in daily applications, they become as repellent as the currenttendency to use every font available.andP;  Color and typography are not justaesthetic considerations.andP;  Productivity and user contentment are bothmeasurably decreased by chromatic and typographical exorbitance.andM;The elaborate laboratory tests to determine which color combinations increaselegibility and selection speed indicate wide variations among subjects byage, sex, and race.andP;  Providing user selection of foreground and backgroundcolors is therefore essential.andM;Such selections should be possible on the fly rather than via some drasticreinstallation procedure.andP;  The other day, while using WordStar Professional4.0 at a client's office, I was alarmed to see that italics (using Ctrl-S)gave me almost illegible dark blue characters on the black background.andP;  Aftertrundling around the menus and help system, I was unable to determine if thisarrangement was a fixed choice.andM;Borland's Sprint, which employs color for type style and other indications,provides a good model for color selection.andP;  You can bring up a grid showingcolored boxes for each choice available, select from them with arrow keys ormouse clicks, then return to your editing.andP;  This method is better, of course,than selecting from textual menus that list color names such as &quot;cyan overmagenta.&quot;andM;I hope I've shed a few lamberts on this vast subject!andP;  Next month, I'llexplore some further aspects of color and the HCI.andM;Footnote serendipity!andP;  I encountered the following passage relevant to myearlier font and legibility discussion.andP;  Even William Morris, the greatEnglish craftsman and designer, misplaced his typographical priorities:&quot;[William Morris] hated the machine because he associated it with the declineof craftsmanship.andP;  His partly sentimental attachment to the 15th century ledhim to use a kind of Jensonian Roman or transitional blackletter; the designsthemselves are bad in so far as they depart from their originals; they failthe elementary test of legibility.andM;&quot;But they were associated with superb decoration and the highest standards ofsetting and presswork, on excellent paper; his books are undeniably beautifulobjects, as long as one forgets their possible use.&quot;
