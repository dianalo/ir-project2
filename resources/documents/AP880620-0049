(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   California's consumer productsliability law, which was passed in a late-night deal and grantsimmunity to cigarette makers among others, will soon get its firstappellate court test.   The law, negotiated at a posh eatery two blocks from theCapitol, was passed as part of a package of tort reform legislationapproved last year.   Supporters say it was designed to relieve court congestion bydiscouraging costly, prolonged litigation like tobacco liabilitycases, none of which has ever been won by a plaintiff in California.   Critics call the law a consumer rip-off and say legislators haveno business trying to discourage such suits.   One trial judge in Sacramento County has dismissed a tobaccosuit because of the law. But trial judges in Contra Costa, Napa andAlameda counties have disagreed, and those cases will be heard inthe next few months by a state appeals court in San Francisco.   Ultimately, all sides agree, the issue will have to be resolvedby the state Supreme Court.   Last week's landmark decision in New Jersey, in which a jury forthe first time found a cigarette manufacturer liable in thelung-cancer death of a smoker, renewed debate over the Californialaw.   It grants immunity to manufacturers of common consumer productsintended for personal consumption that are found to be inherentlyunsafe and are known to be unsafe by ``the ordinary consumer whoconsumes the product with the ordinary knowledge common to thecommunity.''   By specifically citing tobacco _ along with sugar, castor oil,alcohol and butter _ as an example of a common consumer product,the law singles out tobacco companies.   ``California's legislation is unique in actually mentioningtobacco,'' said Richard Daynard, a product liability professor atNortheastern University's law school and chairman of the TobaccoProducts Liability Project in Boston, a group that encouragesproduct liability lawsuits. ``A sell-out, I think it might becalled.''   Almost as controversial as the law itself is the way in which itwas developed in the hectic, waning hours of the 1987 legislativesession. Four of the state's most powerful special interests _insurance, medicine, business and law _ participated in the finalnegotiations, and the deal was formalized on a napkin at FrankFat's, a popular local restaurant.   Consumer groups complain they were excluded from the finalmeeting.   Ironically, the tobacco industry maintained a relatively lowprofile in what was seen more as a battle between lawyers andinsurance companies.   ``The Legislature has made a decision that tobacco companiesshould be immune from the smoker and health-type suits, based onthe statute,'' said Don Miles, a San Francisco attorneyrepresenting the R.J. Reynolds tobacco company in a number ofliability lawsuits.   In any event, the industry insists it is innocent. ``No one hasshown a causal relationship between smoking and any disease,'' saidJim Fyock, a spokesman for R.J. Reynolds in Winston-Salem, N.C.   Representatives of the Tobacco Institute, a Washington-basedtrade association, declined comment on the state's tobaccoliability law.   The Tobacco Institute has reported making campaign contributionsof more than $103,500 to California legislators and statewideofficeholders by May 21.   The compromise containing the law _ dubbed The Deal in theCapitol _ was hastily considered during hearings in the final sixhours of the legislative year.   Supporters say subjecting the deliberately ambiguously wordeddocument to the usual drawn-out legislative hearing process wouldhave destroyed the fragile agreement.</TEXT></DOC>
