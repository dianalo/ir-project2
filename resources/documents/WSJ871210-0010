Instead of allowing the big New York firm to stay on and reargue or appeal the case, the appellate division of the state Supreme Court reiterated its earlier sharp criticism of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell's conduct in the matter.    The law firm declined to comment.    The appellate panel referred the Sullivan andamp; Cromwell proceeding to the court's Departmental Disciplinary Committee &quot;for investigation&quot;; the committee could impose various sanctions up to and including, in rare cases, disbarment.    The panel also asked the committee to investigate an earlier report in this newspaper that Donald Christ, a member of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, assaulted another lawyer at a surrogate's court conference.    The motion that the appeals panel denied yesterday was brought by Martin Wynyard, a Syracuse, N.Y., surgeon who is fighting to keep Sullivan andamp; Cromwell as his lawyer in surrogate court litigation against his sister, Rotraut Beiny of London, the co-beneficiary of a trust set up by their mother.    As previously reported, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell was disqualified as counsel after the appellate division assailed Garrard Beeney -- the brother's attorney handling the case -- for &quot;grossly improper&quot; conduct in obtaining secret files of a now-defunct law firm that represented Dr. Wynyard's parents. </TEXT></DOC>
