If the cartoon shows do well enough against ABC's&quot;Wonder Years&quot; and the ratings leader, NBC's &quot;Unsolved Mysteries,&quot; Wednesdaynight could become the launching pad for one of CBS's upcoming animatedseries, most likely Steven Spielberg's &quot;The Family Dog.&quot;;    By now, everyonemust know that the enormous success of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; on Fox touched off agold rush toward cartoon shows at all three rival networks. Each has a couplein development, some from major players like Spielberg and Steven Bochco(&quot;Hill Street Blues,&quot; &quot;L.A. Law&quot;), whose &quot;Capital Critters&quot; is believed tohave a firm commitment for prime time next season.;    Shrewdly, CBS'sentertainment chief, Jeff Sagansky, has decided to pull together some cartoonodds and ends, package them attractively and start preparing the CBS audiencefor the future.;    Tonight's show, &quot;Bugs Bunny: Overtures to Disaster,&quot;features some new animation tying together some vintage cartoons featuringBugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd, Yosemite Sam, Sylvester and thegang in classical music and operatic settings.;    Next week the half-hourwill be filled by the No. 1 favorite among kids today: the Teenage MutantNinja Turtles in one of their cartoon adventures. They'll be back May 22 witha second adventure.;    On May 1, the attraction is an original &quot;Peanuts&quot;special: &quot;Snoopy is Born, Charlie Brown.&quot; Bugs Bunny returns May 8 with arebroadcast of his Mother's Day special. Then, on May 15, CBS presents anoriginal special, &quot;Garfield Gets a Life,&quot; featuring the fabled fat cat.;   CBS has been running Bugs Bunny, Peanuts and Garfield specials here and therefor years. &quot;Turtles&quot; is on the network's Saturday morning lineup, which is nowNo. 1 among the networks.;    By pulling them all together where toon-fancierscan find them on a regular basis, CBS is testing the waters for a majorrevival of prime-time cartoons, a dormant genre since the days of &quot;TheFlintstones,&quot; &quot;The Jetsons&quot; and their brethren.;    A thoughtful look atAlzheimer's;  Immediately following tonight's 7:30 telecast of the classic TVmovie &quot;Do You Remember Love?,&quot; which features Joanne Woodward's Emmy-winningperformance as a brilliant educator and poet afflicted with Alzheimer'sdisease, Ch. 2 will present its own half-hour special, &quot;Alzheimer's: A LoveStory,&quot; a moving, real-life exploration of the movie's theme.;    In thefeature film, we see the tremendous impact the degenerative brain disease hason a warm, loving middle-aged couple -- and how important the sustaining loveof her husband (Richard Kiley) is to Woodward's bewildered, frightenedcharacter.;    In the Channel 2 special, written and narrated by BobMacKenzie, we meet a couple that could be Woodward and Kiley a decade later.We see Bob, 85, a retired physicist, giving thoughtful, gentle and constantcare to his 75-year-old wife, Dorothy, who hasn't spoken a word to him in 12years.;    Like the Woodward character, Dorothy was stricken relatively young.But her husband tells MacKenzie that he still feels she responds to him. Shewas &quot;a good wife,&quot; he explains, and he's happy to cherish and care for her inreturn for the many years she cared for him.;    Because the disease isirreversible and ultimately leads to total brain dysfunction and death, thepeople we meet won't have any happy endings. Still, MacKenzie captures thecrucial importance of love to these people, who clearly can appreciate it and,in some cases, return it with zeal.;    Though you'll be touched, it's atribute to the literate, intelligent writing of MacKenzie's narration that youwon't be depressed by this thoughtful, even inspiring half hour.;    Gabriel'slast gasp?;  ABC's low-rated &quot;Gabriel's Fire&quot; moves over from Thursdays andstarts what may be its final stretch on the prime-time schedule in a new timeperiod (10-11 p.m.) -- and with Gabriel Bird (James Earl Jones) locked upagain.;    This time the ex-con-turned-legal-investigator fakes mental illnessto get inside an asylum where the patients are abused by a sadistic orderlyand over-drugged, poorly clothed and hardly ever cleaned up.;    What you havehere is a hearty stew of all the nuthouse cliches from &quot;The Snake Pit&quot; through&quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; to &quot;Awakenings.&quot; They even have chubbySydney Lassick reprising his &quot;Cuckoo's Nest&quot; loony role -- plus lots of heavyhamming from Jones.;    &quot;Gabriel's Fire&quot; is one of those shows that's rarelyas good as it should be, and tonight's episode is a good example of what'swrong. But if it doesn't find new viewers soon, the show won't have much moretime to get it right.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Miller column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910417  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  867  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday April 17, 199100108120,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
