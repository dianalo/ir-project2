They are expected to return to Vietnam next month and will be thefirst group of boat people to go home voluntarily from this Britishcolony, which has more than 25,000 Vietnamese languishing in camps.   Deng, speaking through an interpreter, said he was afraid ofbeing imprisoned in Vietnam but would go back anyway because he washomesick for his family. He decided he wanted to go home a monthafter his July 17 arrival in Hong Kong.   Other Vietnamese who plan to go back also mentioned theirfamilies left behind.   Dien Tan Sang, 30, who fled to Hong Kong with his wife and threechildren, said he decided to return ``because my parents are inVietnam and there is nobody to take care of them.''   Dien, who spoke as his 4-year-old son sat weeping in his lap,said he did not know whether he would be punished when theyreturned. Asked if he were frightened, he slowly shook his head andsaid: ``I am not afraid.''   Both men said they were from the Vietnamese town of Quang Ninhand that they fled to Hong Kong, about 500 miles northeast ofVietnam, because others had done so. The trips typically are made inovercrowded and rickety craft.   Reporters previously had not been allowed to speak with the boatpeople who have agreed to return home.   Only 22 boat people voluntarily returned to Vietnam from HongKong between 1979, when nearly 70,000 arrived, and 1988.   But a tough new Hong Kong policy that no longer accepts all boatpeople as eligible for resettlement appears to have convinced someVietnamese to return home.   The Argyle Center group was issued travel documents by anofficial Hanoi delegation that visited the colony this month.   They were among the more than 10,000 boat people who have arrivedsince the Hong Kong government introduced a policy in June underwhich Vietnamese face forced repatriation unless they can prove theyfled their homeland because of persecution.   Most boat people who have arrived since the new policy tookeffect won't be granted refugee status, and those who are eligiblefor resettlement might have to wait years before they are acceptedby another country.   Hong Kong officials have said they hope smooth repatriation ofthe first group will lead other boat people to volunteer to go home.   Vietnam and the United Nations signed an agreement late last yearon the voluntary return of boat people. Under it, Hanoi agreed totreat returnees well and the international organization is toprovide them with assistance.</TEXT></DOC>
