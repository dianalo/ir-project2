Glenn English, D-Okla., says ruraldevelopment legislation being crafted by his subcommittee willreflect individual local needs expressed at hearings in four statesduring the congressional recess.   English, chairman of the House Agriculture subcommittee onconservation, credit and rural development, has been gatheringinformation for months on how best to pull rural communities out ofeconomic depression and stop population losses.   ``The new thoughts and contributions we received sensitized us toregional concerns,'' English said Thursday. ``We will try to makesure that these are reflected in the bill we formulate.''   Hearings were held last month in Clarksdale, Miss.; Amarillo,Texas; Marshalltown, Iowa; and Blackfoot, Idaho. English will go onthe road again Monday when he hears testimony in Le Roy, N.Y., andSept. 18 in Montgomery, W.Va.   English said he hoped to have a bill written next month.   The Senate already has passed a rural development bill, butEnglish's office said the House version may not be ready for a fullvote until next year, and may even be incorporated into the 1990farm bill.   The Senate measure would create a revolving loan fund forinvestments in rural enterprises, establish an insurance fund forlenders and investors, provide additional funding for sewer andwater projects and improve telecommunications links for ruralhospitals.   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., issued a recent report to constituentsin his largely rural district emphasizing the need for localleadership to make any new programs work.   ``I have come to the view that legislation at the federal levelwill at best have only a marginal impact on rural development,''Hamilton said.   ``Assistance from the federal government is not the key toeconomic growth. The initiative for change must come from localcommunities where many tactics can be effective.''</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congress begins hearings Tuesday to review theunderwriting standards issued by the Federal Agricultural MortgageCorp., known as Farmer Mac.
