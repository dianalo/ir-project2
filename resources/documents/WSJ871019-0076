Schlender and Janet GuyonStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/19/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> T SUNWCOMPUTERS (EDP)ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE) </IN><TEXT>   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., bloodied in its attempts to become a big player in the computer business, will announce today a technology-sharing agreement with Sun Microsystems Inc. aimed at helping ATandamp;T develop a new family of high-performance minicomputers and work stations.    According to sources at both companies, the agreement calls for ATandamp;T to buy the right to use Sun's design for a state-of-the-art microprocessor chip that Sun uses in its most powerful engineering work stations. In addition, Mountain View, Calif.-based Sun will help ATandamp;T develop a new, standardized version of Unix, an ATandamp;T developed computer operating system widely used in technical work stations and scientific computers.    The agreement is another attempt by ATandamp;T to standardize the many versions of Unix that have sprouted since the company began licensing the system to outsiders years ago. Earlier this year, ATandamp;T said Microsoft Corp., Redmond, Wash., agreed to develop a new standard version of Unix for personal computers that would incorporate features of Microsoft's own Unix version, called Xenix.    The Sun agreement also may represent ATandamp;T's second attempt to enter the market for high-powered technical work stations and scientific computers. But analysts said ATandamp;T's new machines, which aren't expected to be unveiled today, will be aimed at the much broader business market and won't necessarily directly compete with technical work stations made by Sun.    ATandamp;T and Sun hope their new Unix program running on Sun's chip will become a standard operating system for a broader range of high-performance technical and business minicomputers, much as Microsoft and International Business Machines Corp. have established MS-DOS as a standard operating system for personal computers. Importantly for Sun, the companies also hope Sun's Sparc microprocessor will be adopted by other makers besides ATandamp;T. The agreement with ATandamp;T &quot;lays the foundation for Sun to become a very large company,&quot; said John Fram, a securities analyst for Bear Stearns andamp; Co.    The agreement is also an admission by ATandamp;T that its Bell Labs research arm needs help developing commercial computer products. ATandamp;T is expected to use the Sun chip design as a blueprint for new chips that it will eventually make in-house and use to power a new line of high-powered computers using the so-called RISC, or reduced instruction set computer technology. &quot;One of the mysteries of ATandamp;T is why this company can't develop its own good products&quot; without outside help, said George Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc., Cambridge, Mass. &quot;What is Bell Labs doing?&quot;    ATandamp;T executives have said ATandamp;T's computer business, which last year posted pretax operating losses of $1.2 billion, has reduced losses considerably this year. But outsiders believe ATandamp;T may be just reassigning its computer costs to other ATandamp;T divisions. More troublesome, sales aren't picking up.    ATandamp;T sources said that through August, ATandamp;T's new orders of personal computers were about 82,000, or 1% under budget, including the sale of 22,000 units to its employees at greatly discounted prices. ATandamp;T sources also said new orders through August of the 3B minicomputers were 41% below a budget already reduced from last year. Last week, ATandamp;T reorganized its computer business and gave it its own sales force to help reverse this trend.    Vittorio Cassoni, president of Data Systems Group, ATandamp;T's computer division, has said losses in the first seven months of this year were 45% of those in the same period last year. But some analysts believe losses shrank mostly because ATandamp;T reallocated more than $100 million in development costs to its long-distance business from its computer business. Mr. Cassoni, however, has said his statements on ATandamp;T's losses represent an &quot;apples to apples&quot; comparison with last year.    The Sun agreement, then, is just one element of a larger turnaround plan at ATandamp;T's computer business. To complete the new version of Unix by 1989, William Joy, a Sun co-founder, will lead a technical team with members from both companies. Analysts expect ATandamp;T's 3B family will be upgraded with the Sparc chip, which provides Sun's recently announced Sun-4 engineering work station, a $40,000 machine, with the horsepower of conventional minicomputers costing ten times as much.    ATandamp;T is the only other company to adopt the Sparc chip so far. But sources close to Sun said Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co., which is 22% owned by ATandamp;T and makes all of ATandamp;T's personal computers and work stations, is on the verge of adopting Sun's Sparc chip. Since it introduced the chip design last July, Sun has openly invited other computer makers to buy the chip to &quot;clone&quot; Sun's own machines.    The ATandamp;T agreement &quot;puts Sparc on the map,&quot; said Mark Stahlman, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein andamp; Co. &quot;If there is going to be a RISC standard, this agreement puts Sun ten steps ahead of anyone else.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
