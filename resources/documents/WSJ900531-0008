A year ago, the major hardware makers from Japan andEurope agreed on a standard for the equipment, but they hadto seek clearance from their governments. DAT machinesreproduce sound more clearly and accurately than conventionaltapes.</LP><TEXT>   Spokesmen from Sony Corp. and Matsushita ElectricIndustrial Co., which makes Panasonic equipment, said thecompanies will probably start selling machines in the U.S.later this year.   It still isn't clear, however, whether record companieswill produce the necessary software for the machines. Manyrecord companies have expressed concern that the DAT machineswill encourage greater private copying in violation ofcopyright rules. The standard is supposed to discourage suchbehavior by limiting the ability of the tapes to copy fromcompact disks.   Some Japanese companies displayed DAT machines at the LasVegas, Nev., consumer electronics show earlier this year, butthose were only prototypes, a ministry official said. Morecompanies will probably display such machines at theelectronics show in Chicago, which opens Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
