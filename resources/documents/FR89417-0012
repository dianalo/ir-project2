These revisionswere adopted by the South Carolina Board of Health and Environmental Controlon December 20, 1984, and were forwarded to the State Legislature for approval.The revisions became State-effective on May 24, 1985. EPA finds the revisionsto be deficient for the following reasons.1. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part B.2_South Carolina'sVOC regulations contain a general applicability provision with a 100 tpycutoff level. These regulations must meet the cutoff level specified inthe appropriate EPA Control Techniques Guideline (CTG) category. For non-CTGsources, and for CTG sources that do not have a cutoff level, recommendedcutoffs are described in Appendix D of the November 24, 1987, post-1987ozone policy statement (52 FR 45044). This policy statement reiteratesexisting EPA policy at the time of South Carolina's SIP submittal.2. Regulation 62.1, Section I, 39_A vapor pressure of 0.1 mm Hg shouldnot be used to define VOC. Such a definition would exempt compounds oflow volatility which under certain processes, would volatilize and thereforeparticipate in photochemical reactions.3. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part A.1, A.9, A.22, A.38,A.39, A.51, A.75_These various coating definitions need to specificallyinclude ``functional coatings'' as well as protective or decorative films.4. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section II, Part C.1_This regulationfor the surface coating of paper, vinyl, and fabric does not specificallyapply to saturation processes and must therefore be revised to includethem.5. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part A.75_The definitionof ``vinyl coating'' needs to be revised to state that it does not includethe application of ``vinyl organisol'' as well as vinyl plastisol to thefabric.6. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section II, Part A, B, C, D, E, F,G, H, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T_In the provision for specific sources severalconcerns have been identified. They are as follows:(i) The regulations within Section II, Parts A through H and Parts N throughT need to be revised to clearly state compliance period (e.g., hourly,daily) and averaging method (arithmetic or weighted).(ii) Capture systems are required as a method of control technology forthe following surface coating regulations: Section II_Provisions for SpecificSources Part A.2.e., B.2.e., C.2.e., D.2.e., E.2.e., Part F.3.e., G.3.e.,H.3.e.(iii) Regulations which require capture efficiency systems must specifytest methods.7. Regulation 62.5 Standard No. 5, Section I, Part F, Recordkeeping, Reporting,Monitoring_The recordkeeping requirement provisions as stated in the May25, 1988, OAQPS document entitled, ``Issues Relating to VOC RegulationCutpoints, Deficiencies, and Deviations,'' should be included within thisregulation.8. Regulation 62.5, Standard No. 5, Section I, Part E, Volatile OrganicCompound Compliance Testing_It is not clear in the VOC compliance testingrequirement that the most recent test methods must be used. The regulationmust be revised to state this.At this time, EPA is disapproving the revisions to the South Carolina StateImplementation Plan as listed above. This disapproval is also based onthe following considerations.On May 3, 1988, EPA released the latest data on the degree to which areasthroughout the nation have attained the NAAQS. On May 26, 1988, the HonorableCarroll A. Campbell was notified that the South Carolina SIP was substantiallyinadequate to achieve the ozone NAAQS, pursuant to section 110(a)(2)(H)of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(H). In this letter, EPA requestedthat South Carolina respond to the ``SIP call'' in two phases_the firstphase, within 60 days upon receipt of EPA's letter to the State agency(South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control) which outlinedin detail the SIP call response, and the second phase following the issuanceof the final Ozone/CO policy. The first phase requires that the statesinitiate certain fundamental activities necessary to continue to make progressin attaining the ozone or CO NAAQS. These required activities include thecorrection of identified discrepancies between EPA's existing policy andthe state's SIP or pending SIP submittal.On September 9, 1988, EPA requested that South Carolina correct the identifieddeviations within their SIP. On October 12, 1988, South Carolina notifiedEPA that regulatory revisions within their SIP must be done either undera State initiative or the need to meet federal requirements. South Carolinaadditionally state in their October 12, 1988, letter to EPA that the State-initiatedrevisions involve a more lengthy process, including ratification by theSouth Carolina General Assembly. In order for the regulatory revisionsto meet federal requirements, South Carolina must be able to cite the specific<T4>Federal Register </T4>notification of a deficiency. Therefore, at SouthCarolina's written request and in order to facilitate an expedient correctionof all EPA-identified deviations within the South Carolina VOC regulations,EPA is today disapproving the regulations that have been identified asbeing deficient.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action </ITAG>At South Carolina's request, EPA today disapproves the aforementioned regulatoryrevisions to the South Carolina SIP.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective May 17, 1989 unless, within 30 days of itspublication, notice is received that adverse or critical comments willbe submitted.If such a notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before theeffective date by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdrawthe final action, and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcinga proposal of the action and establishing a comment period. If no suchcomments are received, the public is advised that this action will be effectiveMay 17, 1989.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this disapproval will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities becauseits purpose is to provide the State the basis for correcting its SIP.The Office of Management and Budget has waived review of this action, normallyrequired under Executive Order 12291,Under Section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the Untied States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by May 17, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements.
