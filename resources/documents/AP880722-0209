A three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia did, however, order that New York's case bereturned to the agency for new data because the standards have beenchanged since the cases were filed in 1980 and 1981.   The three states argued that sulfur dioxide emitted fromcoal-burning utility plants and factories in Illinois, Indiana,Michigan, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and Kentucky made itimpossible for them to meet federal air quality standards, and thatthe EPA was required to force those Midwest states to revise theirair pollution control plans.   But the court said that the proper forum for giving the EPAguidance on the issue is Congress, not the judiciary.   Sulfur dioxide is transformed in the atmosphere into sulfuricacid, which concentrates in clouds, falls on its own as fineparticles and is washed out of the atmosphere in solution withrain. Environmentalists say acid rain threatens lakes and streamsand their aquatic life.   New York had argued that the western part of the state wasviolating standards for smoke, dust and soot. Pennsylvania saidsulfur dioxide from Ohio and West Virginia resulted in violationsin in southwest Pennsylvania of the sulfur dioxide standard. Maineargued that it could not meet federal visibility requirements atAcadia National Park because of sulfate haze originating in theMidwest.   New York had suggested in its appeal to the court that it wouldbe willing to gather new data in an effort to show that it couldnot comply with the revised EPA regulations. The court acceptedthat suggestion.   However, in Pennsylvania's case, the court noted that the statedid not have hard data on sulfur dioxide violations and that forone part of the state, Pennsylvania's computer model showed that 80percent of violation came from sources within the state.   The court said that Maine's petition was legally deficient inthat it did not allege that its own clean air plan was threatened.   ``It is well established that when a court is reviewingpredictions within an agency's area of special expertise, at thefrontiers of science, the court must gernerally be at its mostdeferential'' to the agency, wrote Judge David Sentelle forhimself, Ruth Bader Bingsburg and Edmund L. Palmieri.   In the Clean Air Act, ``where Congress wanted EPA to review theadequacy of existing (plans), it said so. Against that backdrop,Congress' silence is significant,'' the panel said.   ``Because the administrator's construction of (the act) isconsistent with the plain language of (the relevant) provision andis a reasonable one, this court must accept it,'' the court said.   In a brief separate opinion ``fully concurring,'' Judge Ginsburgwrote that: ``Congress did not supply such direction in thisinstance; instead it allowed and has left unchecked the EPA'scurrent approach to interstate air pollution. The judiciary,therefore, is not the proper place in which to urge alteration ofthe agency's course.''   EPA spokesman Chris Rice said the agency was gratified that thecourt ruled the ``state petitions were properly denied.''</TEXT></DOC>
