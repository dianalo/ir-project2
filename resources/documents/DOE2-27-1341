<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-27-1341 </DOCNO><TEXT>The de-excitation of the /sup 200/Pb and /sup 199/Pb isotopes, producedthrough the /sup 186/W(/sup 18/O, 4n, 5n) reactions, is investigatedusing {gamma}-ray and conversion electron spectroscopy. The conversioncoefficients are measured and the multipolarities deduced for a greatnumber of transitions. The e/sup -/{gamma}- and {gamma}{gamma}-coincidencesand the half-life measurements lead to several new levels in both levelschemes; the /sup 200/Pb one is extended up to nearly 7 MeV, where anisomer is found. The experimental results are compared to those of microscopiccalculations, performed in a two or three quasi-particle approximation,using a surface delta interaction with a reduced pairing component.</TEXT></DOC>
