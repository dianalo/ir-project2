Commentsand suggestions are requested. The Master Plan reaffirms objectives whichsupport the purpose for which the Refuge was established, i.e,, providinghabitat for migrating and wintering waterfowl. The plan also contains objectivesfor the preservation of endangered species, particularly ocelots and jaguarundi.Finally, secondary objectives relating to public use of the Refuge forinterpretive and recreational purposes have been developed. In additionto the proposed objectives and management strategies presented in thesedocuments, the Environmental Assessment contains brief descriptions ofalternative objectives and management strategies which were consideredduring the planning process, including the public participation phases.The pros and cons of these alternatives and the reasons for their exclusionfrom the Master Plan are presented in each description.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Written comments are requested by December 19, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be addressed to: Regional Director, U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), Departmentof the Interior, has prepared a Master Plan and an accompanying EnvironmentalAssessment on the proposed management of the Laguna Atascosa Refuge, a45,074-acre area located in Cameron and Willacy Counties in the Lower RioGrande Valley near Brownsville, Texas. The plan calls for the slight redirectionof the management program at Laguna Atascosa Refuge in three areas. Thefirst involves the restoration of aquatic habitat necessary to supportfood sources for wintering redhead. The second deals with the developmentand maintenance of habitats important to the perpetuation of endangeredspecies, paticularly cat species, which historically have occurred naturallyin the Refuge area. The third provides for additional emphasis on the developmentof nesting/brooding habitat to enhance the product of mottled ducks.The principal thrust of this Master Plan is the rehabilitation of the LagunaAtascosa (Parker Lake) so that it once again produces adequate submergentaquatic vegetation and other organisms to feed wintering redhead ducksupon their arrival from the breeding grounds. This rehabilitation willinvolve the reshaping of the lake bottom to permit complete drawdown, Oncethat is accomplished, the lake will be drawn down periodically (perhapsevery 2 or 3 years) to allow the lake bottom to aerate and solidify. Thisaeration process stimulates aquatic growth once the lake is refilled, andretards turbidity caused by wave action.Another major thrust of this Master Plan is in the management of brushhabitat for endangered cat species. The ocelot is the principal endangeredcat species known to be resident on the Refuge. Sightings of jaguarundiindicate that this species is present also. In addition to protecting existingcat habitat, about 500 acres of cropland will be converted to brush toincresase the available habitat for these species.This Master Plan calls for a development effort in selected saline grasslandsof the Refuge to expand nesting/brooding habitat for mottled ducks. Theproper construction of additional open water areas in these grasslandsshould triple the mottled duck production on the Refuge.Waterfowl objectives for the three species of geese and sandhill cranes,which winter at the Refuge, remain unchanged. However, with the conversionof almost half of the existing cropland to brush, it will not be possibleto manage the remaining cropland under a cooperative farming arrangement.Thus, this Master Plan calls for the return to ``force account'' farmingwith its attendant increase in operating costs as the means of providinga food supply for these species.The final thrust of this plan involves modifications to the visitor centerand the entrance drive/parking area associated with this building. Theentrance road to the visitor center will be relocated and parking areasrebuilt to permit a more orderly and safe traffic flow around this facilityby the visiting public. A public restroom facility will be constructedadjacent to the visiting center. The present public restroom must be removedto permit rerouting of the entrance road. In addition, an auditorium willbe added to the rear of the visitor center to provide a place for the presentationof interpretive programs to groups of visitors.<ITAG tagnum="84">Coordination</ITAG>Other government agencies and several members of the general public contributedto the planning and evaluation of the Master Plan and Environmental Assessment.Besides a wide variety of Service personnel, others participating in theplanning process included representatives from the Texas Parks and WildlifeDepartment, the Texas General Land Office, the Caesar Kleburg WildlifeResearch Institute, the Cooperative Fish and Wildlife Research Unit ofOklahoma State University, and the Peregrine Fund. Two public meetingswere held to discus alternatives, with a total attendance of approximately115. During the public involvement process seven informational mailingswere provided to interested agencies and the general public.The Service has determined that these documents do not contain a majorproposal requiring preparation of an economic impact analysis under ExecutiveOrder E.O. 11821, as amended by E.O. 11949, and OMB Circular A-107.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 6, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael Spear,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Regional Director.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-24114 Filed 10-18-88; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4310-AN-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
