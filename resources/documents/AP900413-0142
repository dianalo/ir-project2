Gorbachev today warnedLithuania that if it doesn't halt ``anti-constitutional actions''in two days, he will stop shipments of some products to thebreakaway republic.   The tough new threat by Gorbachev was contained in a letteraddressed to the Lithuanian government, which declared independenceon March 11.   The letter was carried by the official Tass news agency and readon the nightly television news program ``Vremya.''   The letter did not specify what products would be halted. But itsaid they were items the Soviet Union could export to othercountries for much-needed hard currency, such as oil, natural gasand coal.   The letter, also signed by Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, saidthe situation in Lithuania ``tightens into an ever tighter knot,assuming the nature of a political dead end.''   Lithuania's leadership, it said, ``continues to adoptlegislative acts and decisions that set Lithuania in oppostition toother republics and the Soviet Union as a whole.''   The president's letter warned that such actions ``can no longerbe tolerated.''   The letter mentioned as ``anti-constitutional actions'' theLithuanian legislature's decision to halt spring conscription intothe Soviet army; attempts by the Lithuanian authorities to seizeproperty of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union; and an April 5law that establishes identity cards for Lithuanians ``thatdiscriminates against Soviet citizens'' in the republic.   The letter said Lithuania's Parliament should ``restore therepublic's position to that of March 10, 1990,'' the day beforeindependence was declared.   In the month since Lithuania declared its independence, theKremlin has been alternating its tone from threatening toconciliatory and back. Soviet troops have occupied some buildingsin the capital, Vilnius, and conscripts who refused to serve in theRed Army were detained. Some deserters were beaten.   On Monday, Gorbachev and his top advisory body, the PresidentialCouncil, said new economic and political steps would be taken tobreak Lithuania's intransigent stand on independence.   The next day, Gorbachev spokesman Arkady Maslennikov said noeconomic blockade was planned. However, he implied that the SovietUnion might start demanding world-market prices from Lithuania foroil, gas and other raw materials the small republic needs.   He said this would cost Lithuania $6 billion.   On Thursday, Lithuania and the neighboring republics of Latviaand Estonia announced that they would form a ``Baltic Market'' todevelop a common economic strategy and closer ties.   Lithuania was forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940 alongwith Estonia and Latvia. Estonia and Latvia also have declaredtheir intention to seek independence but are proceeding morecautiously than Lithuania.</TEXT></DOC>
