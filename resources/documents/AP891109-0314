Michel Camdessus said the so-called Brady plan to reduce thedebt of Third World nations is working, albeit slowly.   For Mexico, a committee representing more than 400 banks wasformed to deal with $52 billion of that country's debt. The bankswere given a choice of reducing the total, reducing interest rates,making new loans or some combination of the three.   ``As far as Mexico is concerned, I am optimistic of theirability,'' Camdessus told reporters. ``Not only because the answerof the banks is positive in general, but because the program is sohigh-quality and because the program is being implementedthoughtfully.''   Camdessus, who was visiting Atlanta to speak at a private dinnerheld by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and to meet with formerPresident Jimmy Carter, defended the debt reduction program devisedby U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and urged critics togive it time to work.   ``I think the Brady plan is an extremely important and positivepart of the debt strategy,'' he said. ``It is just startingworking. It remains to be seen if it will be a full success or apartial one.   ``What I have seen so far is quite encouraging,'' saidCamdessus, whose organization is funded by 152 industrializednations.   For the strategy to work, he said, it will take full cooperationfrom commercial banks, creditor countries and the IMF.   Camdessus said he was opposed to tinkering with the Brady plan,and disagreed with a banking group that on Wednesday called oncreditor governments to reduce debts owed them by ``middle income''debtor nations.   Horst Schulmann, head of the Institute of International Finance,said creditor governments should negotiate delays in repayments ofloans owed to them, stretching them out beyond 10 years.   Schulmann, whose organization represents 150 banks in the UnitedStates, Japan and Western Europe, said such help has been given tothe poorest nations, and now should be extended to others.   Said Camdessus: ``I'm not in favor of a permanent process ofchange of the strategy. I understand very well the very goodintention and probably the good analytical reasons of Mr. Schulmann.   ``But we have just launched a few months ago the Brady strategy.We're just in the process of implementing that.''   To rethink that strategy now, he said, would be ``the mostefficient way of organizing its failure.''   In remarks prepared for his Thursday night speech, Camdessusstressed the importance of reducing U.S. inflation and increasingthe nation's savings rate.   ``The world economy can only take full advantage of theincreased sense of international responsibility among majorindustrial countries if the United States maintains its commitmentto play its part in fostering conditions favorable to worldwideeconomic prosperity,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
