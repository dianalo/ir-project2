<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-09-0719 </DOCNO><TEXT>The prospect of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Force (INF) Treaty ledthe former Supreme Allied Commander, Europe, GEN Bernard Rogers, to claimthat NATO would lose weapons vital to the Alliance's defense when PershingII (PII) and Ground-Launched Cruise Missiles (GLCM) were withdrawn fromEurope. Nuclear weapons and the NATO strategy of flexible response areinseparably dependent upon each other. GEN Rogers' comments focus directlyon the capability which PII and GLCM provided NATO to strike Soviet territoryin event of conflict and if such an escalatory step was deemed necessary.Various sources were researched to determine if the INF Treaty will cripplethe flexible response strategy; while it should not, certain changesin NATO's approach to defense are suggested. Specifically, conventionaland nuclear improvements, the latter within the terms of the INF Treaty,are suggested, as are conventional force reduction negotiations and theEuropeanization of NATO.</TEXT></DOC>
