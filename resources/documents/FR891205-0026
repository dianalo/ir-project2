Background</ITAG>On December 29, 1988, the Commission published its final amended regulationswhich revised the fee schedules contained in 10 CFR parts 170 and 171 (53FR 52632). In the response to comments received on the published proposedrule, the Commission indicated that a portion of the 10 CFR part 170 feeschedule for certain small materials licenses is outdated and in need ofrevision (53 FR 52633). The Commission further stated that a rulemakingon this issue would be initiated in 1989.Part 170 implements title V of the Independent Offices Appropriation Actof 1952 (31 U.S.C. 9701). The fees assessed under part 170 recover thecosts to the NCR of providing individually identifiable services to applicantsfor and holders of NRC licenses and approvals. The fees for radioisotopelicenses issued under 10 CFR parts 30, 40 and 70 and for inspections ofthese licenses were last revised on May 21, 1984 (49 FR 21293). The 1984revision was based on cost and professional staff hour data for fiscalyear (FY) 1981. In the final rule published on December 29, 1988, the previouspolicy of charging inspection fees based on the routine inspection frequencyfor small materials programs was changed to provide for the assessmentof fees for each inspection under 10 CFR 170.31.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Proposed Action</ITAG>The Commission proposes to amend 10 CFR part 170 to update the licensingfees for materials licenses to more fully recover costs for applicationreviews and other services based on FY 1987 and FY 1988 licensing data.For inspection fees, the professional staff hours used in the 1984 ruleto conduct an inspection have been maintained while the Commission exploresways to unify the fee categories with the Regulatory Information TrackingSystem (RITS) inspection categories and licensing program codes. Thereforethe routine and nonroutine inspection fees have increased due to the changein the hourly rate only. It is proposed that the professional hourly rateof $86 for FY 1989 shown in 10 CFR 170.20 will be revised to $95 per hourbased on the FY 1990 budget. (Note that the December 1988 rule revisiondid not apply the $86 per hour charge to the materials fee schedule, butretained the 1981 rate of $58 per hour.) In addition, it is proposed thata fee ceiling be reestablished for all topical reports.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Section-by-Section Analysis</ITAG>The following section-by-section analysis of those sections affected providesadditional explanatory information. All references are to title 10, chapterI, part 170, Code of Federal Regulations.Section 170.3 DefinitionsThis section is revised to remove the paragraph designations for the definitions,arrange the definitions in alphabetical order, and add definitions of ``Indianorganization'' and ``Indian tribe.''``Indian organization'' means any commercial group, association, partnership,or corporation wholly owned or controlled by an Indian tribe. ``Indiantribe'' means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized groupor community of Indians recognized as eligible for the services providedto Indians by the Secretary of the Interior because of their status asIndians.Section 170.11 Exemptions Paragraph (a)(3) is being removed in its entirety. Fees for any byproduct,source or special nuclear materials licenses issued under 10 CFR part 30,40, 70, or 71 that are considered to be incidental to operation of a nuclearreactor will be charged under respective materials fee category ratherthan under the 10 CFR part 50 reactor fee category as has been past practice.Therefore, for a special nuclear materials license or any other licenseswhich are required prior to operation of the reactor, e.g., startup sources,reactor fuel, or calibration or monitoring equipment, fees will be assessedunder 10 CFR 170.31 rather than andSection; 170.21. If an applicant possessesbyproduct, source or special nuclear material for decontamination, inspection,repair, modification or testing of their reactor components, for whicha license is required under the Commission's applicable materials regulations,fees will be assessed in accordance with 10 CFR 170.31. Paragraph (a)(4) is changed to broaden the exemption for non-profit educationalinstitutions to include certain activities (e.g., research) not coveredby the current exemption. It would not include power reactor licenses andmaterials licenses which authorize human use, commercial distribution,or remunerated service to other persons or activities performed under agovernment contract. If a non-profit educational institutions providesservices to other persons without charge, the exemption would apply. TheCommission has received several fee exemption requests from colleges anduniversities for licensed activities not covered by the current exemption.Additionally, this change is in keeping with the concern of Congress regardingthe impact of the current schedule on some entities and their limited abilityto pass through the costs of these charges to the ultimate consumer. Althoughthe legislative history for annual fees contained in part 171 of this chapterdiscusses the option of considering modifications to these fee schedulesfor hospitals, research and medical institutions and uranium producers,the Commission is continuing to limit this particular exemption to non-profiteducational institutions. Paragraph (a)(5) is changed, for clarification, to include certificatesof compliance and other approvals. Paragraph (a)(11) is added to provide that Indian tribes and Indian organizationswill be exempt from license fees. Indian tribes are recognized as separatepolitical entities similar to State governments. The Commission intendsto exempt Indian tribes and wholly owned tribal commercial organizationsconducting licensed activities on tribal lands from license fees in thesame manner as it does States and governmental agencies. Section 170.12 Payment of Fees Paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are revised to more clearly distinguishthe fee payment requirements for materials licenses and approvals not subjectto full cost from the requirements for other licensed activities that aresubject to full cost. Paragraph (h) is being revised to indicate that (1) payments may also bemade by electronic fund transfer (EFT) and (2) that were specific instructionsregarding payment are provided on the bills, payment should be made accordingly.It is the intent of the Commission to request payment by electronic fundtransfer of those bills which are in excess of $5,000. This change is beingmade to encourage timely receipts and deposits in accordance with U.S.Department of the Treasury regulations relating to cash management initiatives.Section 170.20 Average Cost Per Professional Staff-Hour This section is modified to reflect an agency-wide professional staff-hourrate based on FY 1990 costs to the Agency. Accordingly, the proposed professionalstaff rate for the NRC for FY 1990 for all fee categories that are basedon full cost is $95 per hour, or $166.8 thousand per FTE (professionalstaff year). For FY 1990, the budgeted obligations by direct program are:(1) Salaries and Benefits, $196.4 million; (2) Administrative Support,$87.95 million; (3) Travel, $12.31 million, and (4) Program Support, $178.34million. In FY 1990, 1,618 FTEs are considered to be in direct supportof NRC programs applicable to fees (see Table I). Of the total 3,180 FTEs,1,562 FTEs will be considered overhead (supervisory and support) or exempted(due to their program function). Of these 1,562 FTEs, a total of 286 FTEsand the resulting $26.8 million in support are exempted from the fee basedue to the nature of their functions (i.e., enforcement activities andother NRC functions currently exempted by Commission policy). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,22</C><T4>Table I._Allocation of Direct FTEs by Office </T4><H1>Office </H1><H1>Number of direct FTEs \1\</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">NRR/SP <D>982.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">RESEARCH <D>155.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">NMSS <D>307.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">AEOD <D>93.1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ASLAP/ASLBP <D>22.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">ACRS <D>25.0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">OGC <D>33.0</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total Direct FTE </ITAG><D>1,618.0</D><F>\1\ Regional employees are counted in the office of the program eachsupports.</F></ITAG> In determining the cost for each direct labor FTE (an FTE whose position/functionis such that it can be identified to a specific licensee or class of licensees)whose function, in the NRC's judgment, is necessary to the regulatory process,the following rationale is used: 1. All direct FTEs are identified by office. 2. NRC plans, budgets, and controls on the following four major categories(see Table II): (a) Salaries and Benefits. (b) Administrative Support. (c) Travel. (d) Program Support. 3. Program Support, the use of contract or other services for which theNRC pays for support from outside the Commission, is charged to variouscategories as used. 4. All other costs (i.e., Salaries and Benefits, Travel, and AdministrativeSupport) represent ``in-house'' costs and are to be collected by allocatingthem uniformly over the total number of direct FTEs. Using this method was described in the December 29, 1988 final rule (53FR 52639) and the FY 1990 budget, and excluding budgeted Program Supportobligations, the remaining $269.9 million allocated uniformly to the directFTEs (1,618) results in a calculation of $166.8 thousand per FTE for FY1990 (an hourly rate of $95). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s50,10</C><T4>Table II._FY 1990 Budget by Major Category </T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[$ in Millions]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1> </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Salaries and benefits <D>$196.40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Administrative support <D>87.95</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Travel <D>12.31</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total nonprogram support obligations </ITAG><D>296.66</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Program support <D>178.34</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total budget </ITAG><D>475.0</D></ITAG>The Direct FTE Productive Hourly Rate ($95/hour rounded to the nearestwhole dollar) is calculated by dividing the annual nonprogram support costs($296.66 million) less the amount applicable to exempted functions ($26.8million) by the product of the direct FTE (1,618 FTE) and the number ofproductive hours in one year (1,744 hours) as indicated in OMB CircularA-76, ``Performance of Commercial Activities.''For subsequent fiscal years the professional staff-hour rate will be revised,as needed, using the same methodology to arrive at a new hourly rate asdescribed above. Any changes in the staff-hour rate for future fiscal yearswill be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> prior to the beginning of the fiscal year forwhich they will become effective.Section 170.21 Schedule of Fees for Production and Utilization Facilities,Review of Standard Reference Design Approvals, Special Projects and InspectionsSince the Commission decision (53 FR 52633; December 29, 1988) to removethe fee ceiling for topical reports reviews, the number of topical reportssubmitted for review has significantly decreased. It appears that the principalreason for the reduction in topical reports being submitted is the uncertainand potentially unlimited fee for NRC review of these reports. This iscounterproductive to the agency because, in many cases, the regulatoryeffort gains significant benefit in terms of (1) the resolution of safetysignificant problems, and (2) the staff time saved by conducting a genericreview of a topical item thereby saving extensive plant-by-plant reviewin the same or similar areas. Examples of beneficial topical initiativesare numerous. The recent Bandamp;W Owners Group decision to undertake a completereassessment of all Bandamp;W reactor designs, thus eliminating a costlyNRC review, saved time and produced a more complete technical review thancould have been accomplished by NRC alone. Another example is the CE Owner'sGroup development of EP Guidelines for all of its units. This generic effortsaves NRC costly review time assessing plant-by-plant guidelines. Theseare just two of many examples where the public interest is served by anindustry undertaking to resolve an issue. The surfacing of safety significantitems stemming from the review of topical reports and the subsequent resourcesavings to the NRC, as well as the overall high level of technical competenceavailable from industry, justifies NRC encouragement of industry submittalof these reports.In conclusion, a balance must be maintained between the need to encourageindustry submittal of these reports and the need to assess fees for thecosts of reviewing the reports. The current system of charging a fee withno ceiling for NRC review of these reports appears to have had an inhibitingeffect on the industry. As a result, the Commission is proposing to amend10 CFR 170.21, Category J, Special Projects, to provide that the maximumfee for review of a topical report shall not exceed $50,000 and any amendments,revisions, or supplements to topical reports shall not exceed $50,000.This figure represents an adjustment of a previous ceiling of $20,000 toreflect the effects of inflation and is an amount which approximates themedian of topical report fees charged over $20,000 thus far in 1989.The professional hourly rate assessed for the services provided under theschedule is revised as shown in andSection; 170.20. Footnote 2 of andSection;170.21 is revised to provide that the professional hours expended up tothe effective date of this rule will be assessed at the professional ratesestablished for the June 20, 1984 and January 30, 1989 rules, as appropriate.Any professional hours expended on or after the effective date of thisrule will be assessed at the FY 1990 rates shown in this proposed rule.Section 170.31 Schedule of Fees for Materials Licenses and Other RegulatoryServicesThe licensing and inspection fees in this section are modified to reflectthe FY 1990 budgeted costs and to more completely recover costs incurredby the Commission in providing licensing and inspection services to identifiablerecipients. It includes the addition of a category for decommissioningapplications for byproduct material. After the effective date of this finalrule, the fees shown in this proposed rule will apply to those decommissioningapplications that are currently pending NRC review and subsequently filedapplications.Fee Category 3N is revised to include licenses which authorize leak testservices, with a provision added that licenses which authorize leak testservices and/or calibration services only will be subject to fee Category3P. This revision is in response to Health Physics Associates' July 22,1988 comment on the June 27, 1988 proposed revision to 10 CFR 170, othercomments received from applicants and licensees since the inception ofthe June 1984 revision, and to supporting information provided by the Officeof Nuclear Material Safety and Safeguards.By letter dated July 19, 1988, Lixi, Inc. commented on the June 27, 1988proposed rule that 10 CFR 170 should be revised to create a new categoryfor diagnostic devices. Lixi believes doctors should be charged the samefor medical use of the Lixi Imaging Scope as industrial users. At thistime, it is not practical to make a separate category for each manufactureditem. The fee Categories in 10 CFR 170.31 are based on the use of the materialrather than specific types of products or equipment. In addition, in usingthe average-cost instead of the full-cost method for materials licensefees, variations will exist between licenses grouped within a single category.However, in developing the current fee categories, every effort was madeto group licenses in the most logical and equitable manner.Many licenses which authorize human use of diagnostic devices also authorizeother medical uses of byproduct, source, or special nuclear material. Theselicenses are currently subject to fee Category 7C. If a separate categoryexisted for diagnostic devices only, these licenses could be subject tothe fees in the new category in addition to the fees in Category 7C.For these reasons, applications for human use of the Lixi Imaging Scopeand other diagnostic devices will continue to be subject to fee Category7C and industrial uses of the Lixi Imaging Scope will continue to be subjectto fee Category 3P.Fee Category 10B is changed from full-cost to flat fees. This change isbased on an analysis of the actual staff-hours expended for the reviewand approval of the part 71 quality assurance programs.Fee Category 12, Special Projects, is revised to provide that the maximumfee for review of a topical report and any amendments, revisions or supplementsto topical reports shall not exceed $50,000.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Environmental Impact: Categorical Exclusion</ITAG>The NRC has determined that this proposed rule revision is the type ofaction described in categorical exclusion 10 CFR 51.22(c)(1). Therefore,neither an environmental impact statement nor an environmental impact assessmenthas been prepared for this proposed revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Paperwork Reduction Act Statement</ITAG>This proposed rule contains no information collection requirements and,therefore, is not subject to the requirements of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.)<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Regulatory Analysis</ITAG>The proposed revision was developed pursuant to Title V of the IndependentOffices Appropriation Act of 1952 (IOAA) (32 U.S.C. 9701) and the Commission'sfee guidelines. These guidelines took into account guidance provided bythe U.S. Supreme Court on March 4, 1974, in its decision of <T3>National Cable Television Association, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>United States</T3>, 415 U.S. 336 (1974) and <T3>Federal Power Commission</T3> v. <T3>New England Power Company, </T3>415 U.S. 345 (1974). In these decisions,the Court held that the IOAA authorizes an agency to charge fees for specialbenefits rendered to identifiable persons measured by the ``value to therecipient'' of the agency service. The meaning of the Independent OfficesAppropriation Act of 1952 was further clarified on December 16, 1976, byfour decisions of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. <T3>National Cable Television Association</T3> v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F.2d 1094 (1976); <T3>National Associations of Broadcasters</T3> v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission</T3>, 554 F.2d 1118 (1976); <T3>Electronic Industries Association</T3> v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission</T3>, 554 F.2d 1109 (1976); and <T3>Capital Cities Communication, Inc.</T3> v. <T3>Federal Communications Commission, </T3>554 F. 2d 1135 (1976) Thesedecisions of the Courts enabled the Commission to develop fee guidelinesthat are still used for cost recovery and fee development purposes.The Commission's fee guidelines were upheld on August 24, 1979, when theU.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held in <T3>Mississippi Power and Light Co.</T3> v. <T3>U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission</T3>, 601 F.2d 223 (1979), cert.denied 44 U.S. 1102 (1980), that (1) the Nuclear Regulatory Commissionhad the authority to recover the full cost of providing services to identifiablebeneficiaries; (2) the NRC could properly assess a fee for the costs ofproviding routine inspections necessary to ensure a licensee's compliancewith the Atomic Energy Act and with applicable regulations; (3) the NRCcould charge for costs incurred in conducting environmental reviews requiredby NEPA; (4) the NRC properly included in the fee schedule the costs ofuncontested hearings and of administrative and technical support services;(5) the NRC could assess a fee for renewing a license to operate a low-levelradioactive waste burial site; and (6) the NRC's fees were not arbitraryor capricious.This proposed rule revision will not have significant impact on state andlocal governments and geographical regions; on health, safety, and theenvironment; or create substantial costs to licensees, the NRC, or otherFederal agencies. The foregoing discussion constitutes the regulatory analysisfor this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Regulatory Flexibility Certification</ITAG>As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980; 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Commission certifies that this rule, if adopted, will not have a significanteconomic impact upon a substantial number of small entities. The proposedrule affects about 9,000 specific licenses under 10 CFR part 30-35, 40,50, 60, 61, 70, 71, and 72. Approximately 8,000 of these licensees couldbe considered small entities, particularly in the area of materials licensingunder parts 30-35. There is no annual recordkeeping burden imposed by theproposed rule.The NRC does not believe that the increase in fees that would result fromthe adoption of this proposed rule would result in a significant economicimpact on most materials licensees. The increase in the annual cost thatwould be imposed on these licensees would not be significant in terms oftheir gross annual receipts.Any small entity subject to this regulation which determines that, becauseof its size, it is likely to bear a disproportionate adverse economic impactshould notify the Commission of this in a comment that indicates the following:(a) The licensee's size and how the proposed regulation would result ina significant economic burden upon the licensee as compared to the economicburden on a larger licensee.(b) How the proposed regulations could be modified to take into accountthe licensee's differing needs or capabilities.(c) The benefits that would accrue, or the detriments that would be avoided,if the proposed regulations were modified as suggested by the licensee.(d) How the proposed regulation, as modified, would more closely equalizethe impact of NRC regulations or create more equal access to the benefitsof Federal programs as opposed to providing special advantages to any individualor group.<ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. Backfit Analysis</ITAG>The NRC has determined that the backfit rule, 10 CFR 50.109, does not applyto this proposed rule, and therefore, that a backfit analysis is not requiredfor it because these amendments do not require the modification of or additionto systems, structures, components or design of a facility or the designapproval or manufacturing license for a facility or the procedures or organizationrequired to design, construct or operate a facility.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 170</ITAG>Byproduct material, Nuclear materials, Nuclear power plants and reactors,Penalty, Source material, Special nuclear material.For the reasons set out in the preamble and under the authority of theAtomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, the Energy Reorganization Act of1974, as amended, and 5 U.S.C. 533, the NRC is proposing to adopt the followingamendments to 10 CFR part 170.<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 170_FEES FOR FACILITIES AND MATERIALS LICENSES AND OTHER REGULATORYSERVICES UNDER THE ATOMIC ENERGY ACT OF 1954, AS AMENDED</ITAG>1.
