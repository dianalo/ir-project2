Last Thursday, the court granted an insurance-industry request to temporarily stay implementation of the initiative, in which voters gave themselves a minimum 20% reduction in property and casualty insurance rates. On Monday, the state attorney general, who is charged with enforcing the new law, asked the court to lift the stay.    Yesterday, the court gave the initiative's consumerist proponents until next Tuesday to file briefs, and insurance industry opponents until Nov. 28 to respond. The court could still lift or modify the stay in the interim, but that is considered unlikely.    Insurance companies have assailed Proposition 103 as confiscatory and unconstitutional. But backers, arguing that the companies have shown no imminent financial harm, contend that the stay unfairly frustrates the will of the people. Making the situation even more frustrating for the proponents, since Election Day many insurers have stopped writing new policies or have raised rates, citing the uncertain status of the new law. </TEXT></DOC>
