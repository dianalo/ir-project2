Marcel Fontaine was hospitalized a day after describing indetail the horrifying conditions he lived under while held hostage.Two other Frenchmen were freed with Fontaine on Wednesday. One ofthem said American hostages suffered the most brutal treatment atthe hands of the kidnappers.   Elaine Fontaine said her husband began to get very nervous onFriday night, saw a doctor and was ordered back to Val de Gracemilitary hospital for a ``period of decompression'' to last atleast 48 hours.   Fontaine, 45, journalist Jean-Paul Kauffmann, 44, and diplomatMarcel Carton, 64, were freed by their pro-Iranian kidnappers onWednesday and returned to France on Thursday. After extensivemedical tests at the military hospital Friday night, they werereleased.   Fontaine, interviewed Friday night by the radio station Europe1, said his worst moment came when his captors staged mockexecutions, holding a pistol to his neck while firing another gunto frighten him.   He said he was accused by his kidnappers of working as a spy forthe CIA or the Israelis.   ``The tribunal has convicted you. You will be executed thisevening,'' he recalled being told on one occasion.   ``They put a hood on me and faced me to the wall,'' Fontainesaid. ``One of them put a pistol to my neck and another fired a gunbehind me.''   Fontaine said he was blindfolded by day and chained around theclock for much of his captivity.   Kauffmann, his wife and two children left for a few days of restat an undisclosed location in the French countryside, according tohis employer, the weekly L'Evenement du Jeudi.   Carton was with his family at the home of daughter, SimoneEl-Khoury. She said her father told the family he had given up hopewhen he was finally freed.   ``He didn't believe in it anymore. He was completely depressed,crying all the time. He was chained, locked up, without sun, alwaysblindfolded,'' Mrs. El-Khoury told The Associated Press in atelephone interview from her home in Collonge-Bellerive, a Genevasuburb.   Kauffmann, a reporter for the weekly Evenement du Jeudi,recently shared a cell with American educator Frank Herbert Reed,who was ``mistreated to the point of being left prostrate,''Kauffmann's sister, Marie-Genevieve Dagin, was quoted as saying byAgence France-Presse.   Reed was director of the Lebanese International School when hewas kidnapped on Sept. 9, 1986.   Mrs. Dagin was quoted by AFP as saying Kauffmann told her theAmerican hostages held by the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groupIslamic Jihad were ``the object of brutality because they tried toescape.''   The dispatch did not make clear if Kauffmann specified whichhostages were mistreated for attempting to get away.   In his own interview Friday with AFP, Kauffmann said theremaining Western hostages in Lebanon were ``my main concern. I asktheir families to remain patient and stay confident.''   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners still missing in Lebanon.Terry Anderson, 40, chief Middle East correspondent for TheAssociated Press, is the longest held. He was seized March 16, 1985.   AFP quoted Kauffmann as saying the Moslems holding foreignhostages often degraded their captives and ``took everything awayfrom us, even our first names.''   He said the kidnappers gave each of the three French hostages anew name _ Habib for Carton, Najib for Fontaine, Labib forKauffmann, AFP reported.   Kauffmann identified Abu Ali as a particularly cruel guard, theFrench agency said.   AFP quoted the journalist as saying he was moved 18 times duringhis years of captivity, and once was bound up like a mummy, put ina sort of coffin under the bed of a truck and warned to stay silentor he would be killed.   Kauffmann was also quoted as saying he read the novel ``War andPeace'' 21 times during his captivity.   Conservative Premier Jacques Chirac on Friday condemned thosewho ``try to insinuate'' that France made a deal with Iran for theFrenchmen's freedom.   Chirac, who faces incumbent Socialist Francois Mitterrand in apresidential runoff election Sunday, said, ``I say solemnly, I sayon my honor, that no negotiation, no compromise, no bargaining, nodeal took place with any foreign government, or even less with anyterrorist group.'' .   AFP, citing unidentified sources it said were close to Frenchnegotiators, said France and Iran agreed to resume formaldiplomatic relations under a 40-day schedule beginning the day thehostages were freed.   France confirmed reports that one-third of a $1 billion loanIran made to France in 1974 has been paid. Other reports have saidthe remainder was being paid in return for freeing Kauffmann,Carton and Fontaine.</TEXT></DOC>
