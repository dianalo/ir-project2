Todd (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST JAPAN CANDA EUROP </CO><IN> STK PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   Taiwan's stock market faces an acid test this week that could determine whether its phenomenal boom finally has gone bust.    After soaring above the 8000 level early last week, Taipei's composite share index plunged on news that shares of three government-owned banks will be listed on the Taiwan Stock Exchange early in 1989. The index closed Saturday at 7629.27. More than half of the index is made up of existing banking shares, and traders said they feared the new listings would depress the entire finance sector.    Even before the sell-off, local brokers had been predicting a temporary reversal for Taiwan shares. Many foreign analysts, however, believe the market is wildly overvalued and headed toward disaster. Some examples of their reasoning:   --If the listed shares of First Bank of Taiwan were sold at current levels, the $10 billion-plus in proceeds would be more than enough to buy every share of Citibank and Chase Manhattan Bank.    --If daily trading volume, currently running at about $1.3 billion, fell by 90% on the Taiwan Stock Exchange, activity there still would be about twice the recent daily volume on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.    --In July, Taiwan investors opened 23,500 new accounts. In August, new accounts totaled 100,000.    --So far this year, the rise in the value of listed shares roughly equals the country's total output of goods and services in 1987, about $100 billion.    &quot;The country is under the illusion that it's becoming richer by more than one gross national product,&quot; says Myrick Hatch, general manager for Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers in Taipei. &quot;But this wealth is unrealized. That's the point. Eventually, prices will be so high that no one will buy. It's a game of chicken.&quot;    With price-earnings ratios of some stocks beyond the 200 level, many foreigners regard the market as a classic investment bubble that is bound to pop. (The P/E ratio is the share price divided by a company's per-share profit. Over the past decade, U.S. P/E ratios have averaged around 14.)    Overseas investors, whose only access to Taipei stocks is through four mutual funds, are beginning to bail out. A Taipei-based foreign broker estimates that at least 15% of the funds' investors have unloaded their holdings over the past several months.    &quot;Redemptions started in May,&quot; confirms Oscar Wong, who manages the $25 million Taipei Fund for National Investment Trust Co. &quot;They went berserk in August.&quot;    Locally based brokers and some fund managers, however, argue that foreigners underestimate the economic forces that are propelling the Taiwan market. &quot;Don't use my name on this,&quot; says a Taipei broker, &quot;but I think the index can clear 12000 by the end of the year.&quot;    Brokers say some local investors take comfort in regulations that limit daily share-price movements to 3% in either direction. A Taipei-based foreign broker says the reasoning is nonsense: If the limit hasn't stopped the market from rising, he asks, why should it stop a decline?    Says Steven Champion, who manages the $81 million Taiwan (ROC) Fund for International Investment Trust Co.: &quot;We have a real split between local and international investors.&quot; Adds John Nelson, a Taipei-based analyst for Jardine Fleming Securities Ltd.: &quot;People here know the index can't go up 2000 points a month forever, but the situation that created this mess hasn't changed.&quot;    The &quot;situation&quot; is a huge amount of money chasing the 146 stocks listed in Taipei. Residents of Taiwan have growing amounts of cash to invest, and the stock market is one of the few attractive places to put it.    The country's export boom has produced a trade surplus well in excess of $1 billion per month. Compared with year-earlier levels, basic money supply has been growing at about 30% a month. Per capita GNP has doubled in the past five years to more than $5,000.    People are buying record numbers of cars, refrigerators, televisions and designer clothes, but plenty of investment cash is left over. Although the government recently began allowing individuals to place some money offshore, the bulk of it still goes into the local stock market or into property, which also is seeing a speculative boom.    Analysts at Jardine Fleming in Taipei note that lending rates as low as 5% also have prompted many investors to put borrowed money into the market. Property speculation has cooled a bit recently as interest rates rose about a percentage point, and some traders say last week's reversal on the stock market was exacerbated by the higher rates.    Still, &quot;there's an almost total lack of other alternatives&quot; to the stock and property markets, says Danny Chan, a director of Fidelity International who manages the $25 million Taiwan Fund for China Securities Investment Trust Co. He notes that because of government and corporate holdings that rarely change hands, fewer than a quarter of all shares usually are available for trading.    Taiwan Fund is listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The other two, plus the $25 million Formosa Fund, are marketed by London-based brokers.    Foreign analysts who visit Taipei come away awed by hordes of investors swarming in stock-trading rooms. Some money managers, including Marc Faber, a Hong Kong-based executive vice president of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., interpret the crowds as a sign that the market is about to break down. But a stock-exchange official counters that thousands of individuals have yet to enter the market.    &quot;We have only 900,000 brokerage accounts in a country of 20 million, and less than 500,000 are active traders,&quot; he says. &quot;The impression that everyone is gambling in the market is definitely mistaken.&quot;    Financial backers of new brokerage houses apparently share his view. The number of brokers was limited to 28 until last month, but by the end of this month at least 25 new ones are expected to be operating.    &quot;The question is how long the euphoria can last,&quot; says Fidelity's Mr. Chan. &quot;Unless something else happens, it could be when the last new broker opens, or when brokers just run out of new clients.&quot;    Fearing that something else will happen, managers of the four foreign mutual funds already have turned cautious. &quot;Like all speculative markets, something will hit this one,&quot; says Taipei Fund's Mr. Wong.    Among the possibilities the fund managers foresee:   --Government regulators could intervene to stabilize the market, but analysts consider such intervention unlikely.    --A world-wide recession could cool investor attitudes toward the market. &quot;But Taiwan's investors wouldn't react for a while,&quot; Mr. Wong says, because many of them pay little attention to international economic news.    --Failures of major &quot;underground&quot; stock-investment companies could cause a wave of stock selling. Considered a potentially serious threat to the market, these technically illegal but highly popular companies guarantee investors annual returns of 40% to 50%.    Meanwhile, the foreign-fund managers are keeping lots of cash on hand and holding blue-chip stocks that they hope will stand up well in a market decline.    ---   World Market Activity   Share prices fell amid a lack of investor enthusiasm in Tokyo Friday, reversing early morning gains.    The Nikkei 225-stock index closed at 27647.10, off 93.01. The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all first-section issues slipped 5.17 to 2129.64. Volume was 784.6 million shares, compared with 871.1 million Thursday. The market was closed Saturday as part of its regular monthly schedule.    In early trading Monday, Tokyo shares were mixed in quiet trading. The Nikkei index at midmorning stood at 27645.27, down 1.83 points.    On Friday, investors bought large-capitalization issues, mostly steel stocks, early in the session. But continued uncertainty about interest rates and exchange rates eroded their gains in the afternoon, analysts said. &quot;There isn't the energy yet to bring up the whole market,&quot; one Japanese equity salesman at a major brokerage firm said.    He said that at current volume levels, &quot;investors have little choice but to stick to large-capitalization issues.&quot; But, he said, trading volume may have hit bottom last week. &quot;Once we pass the one billion {share} level, investor interest should spread across the board,&quot; he said.    Kobe Steel rose 15 to 545 yen ($4.08) a share, Nippon Steel gained 16 to 717, and Kawasaki Steel was up 16 to 758.    In London, shares finished slightly lower in choppy trading. Stock prices retreated early, then mounted a midday rally, only to ease again in late afternoon. The 100-share index closed down 1.4 at 1738.4 after having been off as much as 22.1 in early trading. The Financial Times 30-share industrial index fell 3.9 to 1398.5. Volume was 380.6 million shares, compared with 412.5 million Thursday.    Peninsular andamp; Oriental Steam Navigation said it raised its stake in Taylor Woodrow to at least 10% from a previously announced 9.9%. Its stock fell 11 to 533 pence ($9.04) a share. Taylor Woodrow lost 5 to 598. Pandamp;O's shares also were hit by reports of a possible downgrading by a major U.K. brokerage house.    In other European markets, stocks closed lower in Paris and Zurich, were mixed in Frankfurt and Amsterdam and rose in Milan, Stockholm and Brussels. South African gold stocks firmed.    In Asian and Pacific markets, share prices fell in Sydney, Wellington and Singapore, were mixed in Manila and Hong Kong and rose in Seoul.    Here are price trends on the world's major stock markets, as calculated by Morgan Stanley Capital International Perspective, Geneva. To make them directly comparable, each index is based on the close of 1969 equaling 100. The percentage change is since year-end.                                                    % This                               Sep 8      Sep 7     Year    U.S. ..................... 245.4      245.2    +  7.0    Britain .................. 526.5      532.0    +  2.1    Canada ................... 356.5      357.8    +  1.7    Japan ................... 1262.1     1254.4    + 23.5    France ................... 365.3      365.4    + 26.6    Germany .................. 184.8      184.2    + 18.0    Hong Kong ............... 1851.5     1862.7    + 12.6    Switzerland .............. 156.2      156.3    + 11.0    Australia ................ 308.1      309.2    + 18.8    World index .............. 437.0      436.5    +  7.1</TEXT></DOC>
