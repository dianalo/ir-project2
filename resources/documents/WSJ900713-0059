The archconservative German Social Union was the onlyparty of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's governingcoalition that objected to retaining the law. &quot;An abortion isalways murder,&quot; said one German Social Union lawmaker.   East Germany allows a female over age 14 to receive anabortion on demand during the first three months ofpregnancy. West Germany allows abortions in the first threemonths only in cases of rape or incest, if the mother's lifeis in danger, if the fetus is expected to be severelyhandicapped, or if the woman's financial situation would makeit impossible for her to raise a child.   In West Germany, a nation of 60 million, there were 75,297abortions performed last year; East Germany, with 16 millionpeople, had 73,000 abortions.                                                                                                          JORDANIAN ART UPROAR                                                                                                          Jordan's Moslem Brotherhood and other Islamicfundamentalist legislators have condemned the government forstaging a Western-style arts festival championed by U.S.-bornQueen Noor. Branding the government as careless andirresponsible, the festival's critics said it should havebeen canceled because Jordan is facing grave economicproblems and should be preparing for a holy war to liberatePalestine. The queen opened the festival Wednesday evening inJerash, 25 miles north of Amman.                                                                                                          SPANISH NUCLEAR INCIDENT                                                                                                          Spain's Vandellos II nuclear plant went back on lineyesterday, four days after it was ordered closed due to avalve leak that filled the containment building withradioactive steam. The start-up of Vandellos II, one of thenewest of Spain's nine operating nuclear plants, wasauthorized by the Nuclear Security Commission after itinvestigated the incident, which didn't leak any radiationinto the air. A commission spokeswoman said preliminaryinvestigative data indicated the plant's owner, theAsociacion Nuclear Vandellos, delayed reporting the incident.                                                                                                          INDIA'S AIRBUSES TO FLY AGAIN                                                                                                          The Indian Airlines Airbus-320 jetliners grounded after afatal crash last February will return to the skies next week,the Civil Aviation Ministry said. Soon after the accident atthe Bangalore airport in southern India, the governmentgrounded the airline's remaining 14 Airbus-320s pending aninvestigation. Civil Aviation Minister Arif Mohammad Khansaid the planes would be reintroduced in phases.                                                                                                          AUSTRALIAN SHEEP                                                                                                          Australia imposed tighter regulations on live-sheepexports in an effort to reverse the sheep's poor image in theMideast. A shipload of 20,000 sheep was rejected by Bahrainthis week because the incidence of scabby-mouth disease wasgreater than the accepted level of 5%. Other shipments to theMideast were turned away in April and May. An official of theAustralian Meat andamp; Livestock Corp. said the new guidelinesinclude having a veterinarian travel on each ship.                                                                                                          KLM HIRES MCKINSEY                                                                                                          KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has hired themanagement-consultant group McKinsey andamp; Co. to advise it onhow to cut costs. The airline said it would form anemployees' committee that would be advised by McKinsey on howto maintain service while cutting costs. The committee andMcKinsey &quot;have to come up with advice about how to do thingsefficiently. In the competitive world of civil aviation, youcan't cut costs that reduce quality because that is what thecustomer wants,&quot; a KLM spokesman said.                                                                                                          DISAPPEARANCE IN POLAND                                                                                                          Lech Grobelny, the founder of the BKO savings bank inWarsaw and owner of a chain of currency exchanges, hasn'treturned from a holiday abroad, the newspaper Gazeta Wyborczareported.   According to the report, Mr. Grobelny left Poland on June6 for a two-week holiday in an undisclosed location.Employees told the newspaper they last heard from him in lateJune when he informed them he would return home July 6.

BKO was closed yesterday, and customers found a note onthe door telling them to &quot;vindicate their claims at adistrict court,&quot; the news agency PAP said.

Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering will no longer behonorary citizens of Potsdam, East Germany, if a City Hallproposal is approved next month, the East German news agencyADN reported. The two were awarded the honor in 1933, but itwas never revoked, partly because of the ousted Communistleadership's fear of causing a public scandal, ADN said. . ..
