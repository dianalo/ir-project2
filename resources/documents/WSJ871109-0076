The concerns said they filed a notice of appeal with the federal district court in Washington late Thursday or Friday. The six Baby Bells include New York-based Nynex Corp., Chicago-based Ameritech, Atlanta-based BellSouth Corp., San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, Englewood, Colo.-based U S West Inc. and St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp.    Bell Atlantic Corp., Philadelphia, said it plans a similar filing today. The actual appeals will be made to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.    None of the six companies disclosed the grounds on which they plan to appeal. But Pacific Telesis's chief lawyer said the companies basically will argue that Judge Greene in his ruling incorrectly applied a key section of the decree dismantling the Bell system in 1984.    Judge Greene presided over the breakup and continues to monitor compliance with terms of the related decree. After review, the judge on Sept. 10 ruled to continue bans prohibiting the seven Baby Bells from providing long-distance calls and from making phone equipment. He also continued to bar them from providing information, such as directories, in electronic form. The ruling does allow them to use their phone networks to transmit information supplied by others. The restrictions were first imposed at the breakup.    In an interview, Robert Dalenberg, Pacific Telesis's general counsel, said the ruling centered on Section 8c of the decree. According to him, the section says that the Baby Bells should be granted waivers to engage in those businesses if the companies demonstrate their entry won't harm competition. &quot;The lower court didn't correctly apply&quot; the section, Mr. Dalenberg said.    He said Pacific Telesis also will argue the ruling violates its First Amendment rights by barring the company from electronic publishing, such as computerized yellow page directories. Earlier last week, Bell Atlantic said it planned a similar argument.    Baby Bell opponents have argued the Baby Bells maintain a monopoly over local public phone networks and might use their position to hurt competitors if allowed to provide long-distance calls and to make equipment.    The phone concerns argue that ample competition exists to warrant their entry into at least some parts of the long-distance and manufacturing markets. </TEXT></DOC>
