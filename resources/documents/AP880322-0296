Trade Minister Pat Carney told the House of Commons in Ottawathat Canadians would be ``exposed to the law of the jungle'' inworld commerce if the government did not support the rulings,scheduled for ratification Tuesday by the full council of GATT,which is based in Geneva.   Canada had the option of fighting or ignoring the rulings by the95-nation GATT, which sets international trade rules andadjudicates disputes between members. But that course could haveled to retaliation, such as duties on Canadian goods.   A preliminary GATT ruling last fall said Canada'sprovince-by-province system of marketing alcoholic beveragesunfairly favors domestic wine, beer and liquor.</TEXT><TEXT>   The GATT panel was assessing a longstanding complaint againstCanadian liquor boards by the 12-nation European Community, whichwants to sell more wine and brandy in Canada.   Carney said Canada will open borders to more foreign wine andliquor, as the GATT asked, but protection will continue for the$3.4 billion Canadian beer industry.   Canadian wines, mostly of low quality, have a 45 percent shareof the domestic market because of a government policy limitingimports. Ontario Province puts a 66 percent surcharge on foreignwines.   The Europeans do not plan large-scale beer exports, althoughbeer was included in their complaint. But if Canada dropped itsimport barriers for beer, the path would be cleared for the majorU.S. breweries to swamp the Canadian market.   At present, Canadian provinces only permit the sale of beerbrewed within each province by the nation's 40 breweries, with afew foreign imports. U.S. beers are brewed in Canada under license.   The Brewers Association of Canada warned last week that 19,000Canadian jobs would be lost if the American beer companies moved in.   Carney said the government is reviewing a petition by Canada's33 wineries to launch a GATT challenge to the heavy subsidiesenjoyed by European Economic Community vineyards. In the meantime,the government will consider adjustment programs for Canadian winegrowers and winemakers, she said.</TEXT><TEXT>   On West Coast fish, the GATT preliminary ruling condemned Canadafor curbs on the export of raw salmon and herring. The fish iscurrently processed in British Columbia before shipment, raisingits price and discriminating against U.S. fish processing companies.   Carney said the government would accept the GATT ruling but willintroduce new measures to force Canadian fishermen to land theircatch in British Columbia. Some are now selling salmon or herringoff their boats to U.S. fish companies.</TEXT></DOC>
