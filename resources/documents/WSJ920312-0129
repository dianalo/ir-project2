During a two-day visit by U.S. Secretary of State JamesBaker, intense U.S.-EC negotiations produced the first hintof progress in months. The officials were trying to overcomea farm-subsidies dispute that has been the most intractableroadblock in the so-called Uruguay Round of global tradetalks, taking place under the auspices of the GeneralAgreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.</LP><TEXT>   Many equally difficult problems remain, but at least onekey issue in the subsidies controversy inched towardresolution. Though details are sketchy, European officialssaid the U.S. for the first time appeared to accept that theEC was indeed making a good-faith effort to scale down itsexpensive agricultural policy. The EC could thus be allowedto compensate its farmers temporarily for the sacrifices theywould have to make under the new GATT rules, making theprocess more politically acceptable in Europe.   The minor advance revived hope that the Uruguay Roundcould still survive. &quot;At least they're still talking,&quot; said asenior trade official in Geneva. &quot;The latest news is mainlyimportant because they haven't given up.&quot;   But in Washington, a senior U.S. trade official said hedidn't see any significant improvement in the U.S.-E.C.dispute over GATT. &quot;There's no breakthrough, or suggestion ofprogress,&quot; he said.   Despite the trade talks' promise of greater world economicgrowth and increased employment, U.S. and EC officials hadbeen pessimistic that negotiations could be concluded thisyear because of elections in the U.S., Britain, France andelsewhere. In such an environment, powerful interest groups,including European farmers and U.S. textile workers, havemade progress politically difficult.   The EC's agriculture commissioner, Ray MacSharry, saidthere was &quot;some movement&quot; in the GATT talks, but warnedagainst over-optimism. He noted &quot;some progress in some areas&quot;but said major difficulties remain.   The EC has contended that the only way it could meet thedemands of the U.S. and other food-exporting nations to slashEurope's entrenched farm-export subsidies and productionincentives was to replace them with direct payments toencourage farmers to take land out of production. Until now,however, the U.S. and GATT's director-general, Arthur Dunkel,have called for such direct payments to be subject to thesame steep cuts to be applied to most other farm subsidies.   People close to the talks said the U.S. compromise, firstmade last week in a letter from President Bush to ECCommission President Jacques Delors, would allow a specialcategory of subsidies to be treated in a more lenient way.Negotiators are still working out details of how this couldbe done.   But EC officials cautioned that other key sticking pointsin the GATT farm negotiations that are unresolved include theEC demand that it be allowed to raise tariffs on cerealsubstitutes in exchange for lowering duties on otherproducts, and U.S. demands for big reductions in EC farmexports.   Some EC officials expressed irritation at Mr. Baker'scharacterization of the U.S. offer as &quot;generous,&quot; saying theU.S. was exaggerating the importance of its proposals andtrying to shift any blame for a continued GATT deadlock on tothe EC.</TEXT></DOC>
