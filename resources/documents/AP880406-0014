The agency has received 260 complaints since January from iratecallers who were billed by a company they had never heard of, atrates that were several times the rates charged by the majorlong-distance companies.   In one case, the charges were 10 times higher, the FCC said.   The complaints have prompted the FCC to begin looking into thepractices of alternative operator services, known as AOS companies,which have emerged to compete in a $7 billion-a-year market thatuntil recently was served only by American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.   ``We've never seen a situation quite like this addressed by thecommission,'' describing the complex nature of the problem AOScompanies pose, said Greg Vogt, chief of the FCC's telephoneenforcement division.   ``We don't want to have a knee-jerk reaction that could kill anindustry,'' he said, adding that the commission needs moreinformation before deciding whether federal action is warranted.   AOS companies began forming within the past two years ago tofill the void left when ATandamp;T stopped paying commissions to hotelsand motels on the long-distance calls made by their guests.   Atleast some of the AOS companies kick back money to thecontracting hospital, hotel, motel or other business.   The AOS companies, now estimated to number around 40, handlecalls mainly made by the transient public in hotels, motels and atpay phones as well as hospitals and universities. They handlecredit-card, collect and third-party billed calls.   Typical complaints, the FCC said, are that callers are given noindication that an AOS company is handling their calls or that theywill be billed at higher rates than those of the company whoselong-distance credit card they are using.   AOS rates are not regulated by the FCC. The commission regulatesthe rates ATandamp;T can charge but not the rates of any otherlong-distance companies because none is large enough to controlmarket prices.   In complaints investigated by the FCC, the AOS companies haverefunded the disputed amount, Vogt said.   At an establishment served by an AOS company, callers who dial``0'' for an operator are routed to the AOS. An operator getsbilling information and then sends the call over a line the AOSleases from one of the long-distance carriers, like ATandamp;T or MCICommunications Corp.   Many of the callers who end up connected to an AOS company arethose using a credit card issued by a local Bell phone company orATandamp;T, since use of those cards require callers to start by dialinga ``0.'' Other companies' cards require callers to dial a local or800 number to place their call.   Most of the AOS companies have billing contracts with the Bellcompanies, which means callers receive the AOS charges along withtheir monthly local Bell phone bill. Some AOS companies also acceptpayment by other credit cards such as MasterCard and Visa.   The FCC advises that callers ask an operator what company theywork for, what rates they will be charged and how they will bebilled before placing the call. If they are dissatisfied, theyshould find another phone, the FCC says.   Several states have begun considering regulation of AOScompanies because of complaints and some have issued consumeralerts.   AOS companies say theirs is a new and growing industry to whichconsumers haven't yet become accustomed. The major AOS companiessay their operators are trained to identify themselves to callersbefore placing their calls.   Vogt said, however, that some AOS companies can place automatedcalls, which substitute ``bong'' tones for a live operator toinstruct callers on how to proceed with a credit card. There is nofederal requirement for AOS companies to identify themselves, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
