Young Jr., director of BXA's Office of Information Management, saidthe backbone is a five-node FDDI network from In-Net Corp. of San Diego.andO;five 4-megabit/sec token-ring local area networks, each on a different floor,hand from the backbone.andM;The installation of the FDDI network by CIS Inc., an 8(a) contractor inSilver Spring, Md., is part of an effort to get every licensing officer amultifunction workstation for office automation and access to a remote IBMCorp. 3081 mainframe.andM;As a result of this project, BXA was able to approve more than 74,000licenses in 1989 to ship about $200 billion in goods.andP;  &quot;In 1984 it took about46 days to process an export license for the Free World.andP;  The last figureI've seen show it now takes between eight and nine days,&quot; Young said.andM;In BXA's network, all five servers, which are Model 9300 computers fromHarris Corp.'s Data Communications Division in Dallas, are on one LAN.andP;  Theother LANs support user PCs.andP;  Although this setup results in higher volume oftraffic on the backbone, officials said it also allows for better control ofthe servers and works out well for security.andM;&quot;They could have gone with a 4-megabit/sec backbone, but they also werelooking toward future requirements,&quot; said Charles K. Spalding, CIS' projectmanager.andP;  Spalding expects the LANs soon will move up to the 16-megabit/secversion.andM;The Model 9300s store all network applications -- such as mail, calendaring,spreadsheets and word processing -- which are served down to the user PC'smemory for execution.andM;Also, the servers function as communications controllers, giving PC usersaccess to the mainframe and about the performance they would get fromterminals attached to a cluster controller in an IBM 3270 environment.andM;The mainframe, located about 15 miles away in Springfield, Va., hosts thelicensing officer's key resource -- the Export Control Automated SupportSystem (ECASS), an interactive database developed with the Model 204 programfrom computer Corp. of America of Cambridge, Mass.andM;Licensing officers access the mainframe as well as network applications via ashell menu, WordPerfect Office 3.0.andP;  This main menu permits hot-key switchingamong network applications and allows for cutting and pasting data fromdifferent applications onto a clipboard, Young said.andM;Multimode 62.5/125-micron optical-fiber cabling runs throughout the network.andO;Specifically, the FDDI network has four fibers and the LANs two fibers,although considerably more fiber has been installed to support voice trafficand Integrated Services Digital Network traffic, Spalding said.andM;The FDDI fiber cabling comes into a light interface unit (LIU) from SiecorCorp. of Hickory, N.C.andP;  the LIU performs a function similar to a patch panel.andO;The cabling then goes to the In-Net FiberTalk 5000 token-ring FDDI bridge.andM;Copper wire links the bridge to an 8-port media access unit (MAU) fromProteon Inc. of Westborough, Mass.andP;  fiber cabling connects the MAU to theLIU, and from there the fiber runs horizontally out onto the floor.andM;User PCs with Proteon network interface cards connect via IBM Type 1 coaxialcable to the MAU.andM;Spalding said BXA soon will take four of the servers and put two each onseparate token-rings, leaving the fifth server on its own network.andP;  BXA alsowill add three additional FDDI nodes to the backbone.andM;Spalding said BXA expects to double the number of users to about 450.andP;  Itcould link a total sevral times that number.andM;The servers, each of which houses a 3270 board, have an RS-232 connection toan Omnimux 82 nultiplexer from Racal-Milgo of Sunrise, Fla.andP;  The company'sData Encryption Standard devices are used at each end of a dedicated56-kilobit/sec circuit to the mainframe.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
