The decline was the first setback for the U.S. currency since major central banks intervened to support the dollar late last week. The intervention followed Thursday's coordinated interest rate cuts by several European nations. Firmer U.S. interest rates failed to revive the dollar yesterday.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.6640 West German marks, down 0.9% from 1.6783 marks Monday. It stood at 132.63 Japanese yen, down 0.3% from 132.97 yen. The British pound rose 0.7% to $1.7993, from $1.7863.    To some extent, traders expected the dollar's latest rise to be cut short by position adjustments in preparation for tomorrow's report on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for October. &quot;There's widespread skepticism that the movement will continue, especially in advance of the trade figures, which nobody expects will be good,&quot; said James S. Vick, vice president and senior corporate trader at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. in New York.    The monthly trade reports have become the most important economic data affecting dollar exchange rates. Tomorrow's report on October trade is expected to show little if any improvement from September's $14.1 billion deficit. Mr. Vick said the deficit would have to shrink to $12.5 billion to renew a rally in the dollar, and a gap exceeding $15 billion &quot;would bring the bears out of their caves.&quot;    The dollar's sell-off in Asia came despite a firming of U.S. interest rates this week and last week's rate cuts in Europe. The rate adjustments widen the interest-rate gap favoring dollar-denominated investments.    The decision by the West German Bundesbank to keep its rate on securities repurchase agreements steady at 3.25% yesterday, despite last week's discount rate cut, didn't affect the dollar, however. There was earlier speculation that the repo rate would be lowered, further enhancing the appeal of yields on dollar investments.    Yesterday many of the usual participants were absent from the market as trading rooms in the U.S. and Europe geared down operations for the remainder of the year. Except for tomorrow's trading in reaction to the trade data, dealers said volume will probably trail off, with most of the activity occurring in Tokyo, where the market is less affected by the Christmas holiday season. &quot;The Far East will be the most liquid market,&quot; said Charles A. Luma, vice president of foreign exchange at Industrial Bank of Japan's New York branch.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $2 an ounce to $483.50 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $483.60 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Tuesday, Dec. 8, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
