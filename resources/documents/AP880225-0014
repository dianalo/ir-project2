DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer </BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In 1988 as in 1980, it is proving difficult tokeep the plight of American hostages abroad from becoming an issuein the presidential campaign.   President Reagan's spokesman has rebuked Democratic hopefulMichael Dukakis for bringing it up, but the record shows thatReagan was not shy about criticizing Jimmy Carter on the same issuein his own campaign eight years ago.   The matter cropped up again Wednesday when Republican aspirantPat Robertson said his Christian Broadcasting Network once knew thewhereabouts of American hostages in Lebanon ``and they could havebeen freed.''   Reagan, in the nearest thing yet to a rebuke of any of the GOPhopefuls, asked at his news conference Wednesday night, ``Isn't itstrange that no one in our administration was ever apprised ofthat?''   ``If he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself,'' thepresident said.   Two days earlier Massachusetts Gov. Dukakis was criticized byReagan spokesman Marlin Fitzwater for bringing the issue up whiletalking to reporters after a governors' meeting at the White House.   Dukakis said the administration needed a ``much tougheranti-terrorism policy.'' He said, ``you can never, ever, makeconcessions to terrorists. That's what we did in 1985 (in the Iranarms sale initiative) and it hurt us very badly.''   Said Fitzwater: ``It's very dangerous to make terrorism apolitical issue, especially when you're talking about specificepisodes. As we have learned, as indeed the nation has learned, inthe last several years of experience, there are any number ofaspects to individual hostage-takings that can be exacerbated bypolitical talk or media talk or political statements. I wouldsimply urge caution on everyone's part, including politicalcandidates.''   On Jan. 7, 1980, however, while campaigning for the GOPpresidential nomination in the New Hampshire primary, Reagan saidCarter's response to the taking of American hostages in Iran was``too sluggish.''   ``I believe it's appropriate to suggest that anything that hasbeen done by the administration so far, could have, should have,been done in the first hour,'' Reagan said. He said the UnitedStates should have ordered an economic boycott and set a deadlinebeyond which the boycotted country could not go without seriousharm to itself.   And on Oct. 28, 1980, only a few days before the election,Reagan said in a debate with Carter in Cleveland that it was ``hightime that the civilized countries of the world made it plain thatthere is no room worldwide for terrorism. There will be nonegotiation with terrorists of any kind.''   When asked what specific ideas he had, however, Reagan said onlythat he did have some but did not want to inject them into thecampaign for fear of endangering the hostages. He said there shouldbe a congressional investigation after the hostages were released.   On the weekend before election day, after receiving Iranianproposals that he said appeared to ``offer a positive basis'' for asolution, Carter canceled campaign appearances and flew back toWashington. ``We are within two days of an important nationalelection,'' he said. ``Let me assure you that my decisions on thiscrucial matter will not be affected by the calendar.''   Earlier, however, Carter had aroused skepticism about hismotives when he made an announcement regarding another abortiveIranian overture on the morning of his crucial Wisconsin primarybattle against Sen. Edward M. Kennedy.   In the end, the hostages were released on inauguration day inJanuary, 1981, and Reagan, by agreement with Carter, made nomention of it in his inaugural address because the plane carryingthem to freedom had not yet cleared Iranian air space.   Politics aside, Reagan's desire to get the hostages out ofLebanon, like Carter's dedication to freeing the hostages fromIran, is clearly an overriding concern.   In words that echoed many of his previous statements _ and forthat matter some of Carter's _ the president said Wednesday nightthat ``it's very frustrating to try and establish a location,knowing of course that you are governed by the fact that unwiseaction on our part could bring about harm to the hostages. Butwe've never let up, and we never will, in trying to obtain thefreedom of all the hostages.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   W.
