But when the turning point doescome, a once-parochial power company named RWE AG could beamong the first to reap the rewards.   In the past 12 months, RWE has bought control of westernGermany's second-largest construction group, seized a majorshare of eastern Germany's power industry and begun buildingmore than 200 gasoline stations there. At the same time, theconglomerate has raised its profile abroad by bidding forU.S. firms. After buying Texaco Inc.'s German operations in1988, RWE now is seeking to acquire Houston's Vista ChemicalCo. and a stake in Consolidated Coal Co., a unit of Du PontCo.</LP><TEXT>   Leading the charge is Friedhelm Gieske. In the three yearssince he took control, RWE has made more major acquisitionsthan it had in the previous half-century.   RWE's sudden transformation is one of the more startlingexamples of how German companies are adjusting to a radicallychanging Europe. The parting of the Iron Curtain, Germanunification and the move toward European political andmonetary integration have forced many firms to change. Cozyhome markets are looking less secure even as Europe preparesfor a greater world economic role.   Before 1988, RWE was an archetype of Germany's sleepinggiants, a huge conservative conglomerate with a cash hoard ofmore than 10 billion marks ($6 billion at current exchangerates). It was used to living well from a near monopolyguaranteed by a 1935 pact that divided Germany's power marketfor major vendors.   From its founding in 1898, RWE built an empire byconverting coal into electricity for the bustling Ruhrindustries, developing what would become West Germany'slargest power company. Sales and profits rose in lock-stepwith German growth as RWE supplied West Germany with roughlya third of its electric power.   But by the 1980s, RWE's outlook had lost much of itsbrightness. The postwar recovery was over and demand forpower stagnant. Increasingly vocal pressure groups werecalling for alternative energy sources, threatening RWE'scoal-fired power plants. At the same time, RWE's newestnuclear plant at Mulheim-Kaerlich was shut down after only abrief start-up in 1988, a victim of public demand for amoratorium on nuclear-energy expansion.   RWE's management was slow to respond. For nearly a centurythe company had been run much like a public authority --under a management board that worked by consensus, eveneschewing a chairman. Dynamic leadership was discouraged, atthe expense of a new direction.   &quot;One said that RWE didn't adjust to the times, it didn'tarticulate itself clearly and not always correctly,&quot; says Mr.Gieske. &quot;We didn't recognize certain things. It was verynecessary to improve the picture of the company and show thepublic that things are changing here.&quot;   The changes at RWE were nothing short of a revolution. Asis often the case, Germany's power-brokering Deutsche Bank AGplayed a key role. Wilhelm Christians, then the bank'sco-chairman and chairman of RWE's supervisory board, backed aplan to abandon the company's consensus principle and nametwo co-chairmen. One was Mr. Gieske, who joined RWE in 1953,served as its chief financial officer for 15 years and was aclose ally of Mr. Christians.   &quot;It became clear that a company of this size could nolonger be managed in its former form,&quot; recalls PeterPhilipsen, a labor representative on RWE's supervisory board.&quot;We also saw that standing still meant regression.&quot;   In July 1989, with the resignation of co-chairman GuentherKlaette, Mr. Gieske became sole chairman. Before long, thenewly energized RWE was catching up with and, by manymeasures, surpassing other German power vendors such as VebaAG, which had begun diversifying earlier.   &quot;Gieske came in with an aggressive and assertive policylooking for long-term growth,&quot; says Kiran Bhojani, an analystfor M.M. Warburg Bank in Hamburg. &quot;If you diversify, you haveto go abroad, hopefully to the U.S., and he's doing that. Allthis reflects a management that's now willing to take risks.&quot;   Mr. Gieske's first major move came in June 1988, when RWEpaid $1.2 billion for Deutsche Texaco AG, the West Germansubsidiary of U.S. oil giant Texaco Inc. Mr. Gieske calls theTexaco deal his best investment to date, one that lifted RWEout of its rut. With one transaction, RWE became Germany'ssecond-largest petroleum retailer.   Other acquisitions rapidly followed. RWE raised to acontrolling interest its minority holding in Hochtief AG,Germany's second-largest construction group. And it acquiredthe U.S. printing machinery group Harris Graphics Corp. forabout $500 million to round out a printing machineryoperation centered around Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG   Mr. Gieske then built up a waste-disposal business bypicking up scattered companies and welding them into a newRWE division.   Criticism of RWE's fast-moving chairman has been rare. Yetsome union officials wonder if Mr. Gieske is expanding toofar, too fast -- possibly jeopardizing RWE's core energyoperations. Some analysts judge that RWE's ballooninginvestment costs could depress profit growth over the nextseveral years. But so far, the numbers have sided with Mr.Gieske.   The new additions swelled RWE's sales in the year endedJune 30 to 44.2 billion marks from 26.8 billion marks a yearearlier. For the year ending this June 30, Mr. Gieske saysRWE expects another rise in profit and sales; group netprofit rose 12% in the first half on a 7.8% rise in sales.For the nine months ended March 31, group sales were up 9.7%.   Mr. Gieske says RWE will keep expanding through themid-1990s with a new five-year, 30-billion mark investmentplan, nearly double the previous five-year spending plan, tobe financed entirely with cash from operations. &quot;The 30billion {marks} can be generated by us without any noteworthyuse of capital markets,&quot; he says. &quot;We won't overextendourselves.&quot;   Last year, Mr. Gieske set about finding an acquisition toround out RWE's specialty chemicals operation, much of whichis folded in its new DEA Mineraloel unit, the former DeutscheTexaco.   The restructuring timetable may be slowed by regulatoryhurdles, such as the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. Theagency is delaying its approval of RWE's $590 million, or$55-a-share, bid for Vista Chemical pending a review of thepair's combined market in aluminum oxide, used in catalyticconverters for cars. Though only a part of Vista's specialtychemical business, it is a profitable one. For RWE, whichalso would assume $570 million of Vista debt, it is all ornothing.   Vista, which also would help extend RWE's global reach,isn't even his latest target. More recently, RWE launchedanother foray into the U.S. by opening negotiations toacquire a 50% stake in the Du Pont's Consolidated Coal unitfor an estimated $1 billion.   For all of its diversification, Mr. Gieske says RWE willremain Germany's principal power company with a heavy biastoward lignite coal as a cost-effective primary energysource. The group's RWE Energie AG division remains its majorsource of income.   The brown coal accounts for 50% of RWE's energy sourcing,and 23% comes from burning hard coal. Only 20% of RWE's powercomes from nuclear fuel, compared with a 34% nationalaverage.   The future of nuclear energy in Germany remains uncertain,Mr. Gieske says. Speaking for the industry, he says that nomajor power vendor would order a new nuclear plant in Germanywithout an unambiguous political commitment to the expansionof nuclear power.</TEXT></DOC>
