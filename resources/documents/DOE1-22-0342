Almostall phase shifts smoothly connect with the previous results of the Saclay-Genevaphase shift analysis below 800 MeV. Due to recent Saturne II resultsthe data base is now sufficiently abundant to perform such an analysis.Present results strongly disagree with the predictions of Arndt et al.,for most phase shifts. Argand diagrams suggest a non-resonant behaviourof the /sup 3/F/sub 3/ partial wave and a resonance-like behaviour forthe /sup 1/G/sub 4/ partial wave.</TEXT></DOC>
