Bush was not more specific on what the United States might do tohelp Panama recover from invasion-related damage, estimated atperhaps $2 billion, and from two years of economic decline thatflowed partly from the U.S. sanctions against Manuel AntonioNoriega.   Nor did Bush address where his administration will find money tohelp Panama in a foreign aid budget already strained past itslimits. Foreign assistance is among the least popular programs onCapitol Hill, where the president would have to secure approval foraid to Panama.   It was learned separately that Bush administration officials arelooking into possible aid that includes:   _Building houses for people left homeless by the bombing andcombat.   _Helping Panama to pay its $543 million in foreign debt so itcan get new loans.   _Getting other nations involved in the recovery effort.   _Loans to help businesses recover.   While recommendations have yet to be drawn up and presented toBush, one administration source said ``there's a sense of urgencyand we want to move quickly and respond quickly.''   One official, who, like the others, requested anonymity, said italso is likely the administration will move up from March the dateon which officials must certify whether Panama is cooperating inantidrug efforts.   By speeding up the evaluation, the administration could enablePanama to receive U.S. trade benefits and Caribbean BasinInitiative benefits and have its sugar quota reinstated, thatofficial said.   The embryonic, U.S.-installed government of President GuillermoEndara has expressed strong antidrug sentiments and would beexpected to win certification, said the official. Suchcertification was denied to Panama under Noriega, now in U.S.custody on a variety of drug charges.   ``The revitalization of the Panamanian economy is a majorpriority in the months ahead,'' Bush told a White House newsconference, ``as are our efforts for humanitarian assistance.   ``I can report today that considerable progress has been made sofar in returning Panama to a normal state of affairs. The newgovernment has taken charge, and President Endara is workingtirelessly to meet the needs of his people.''   Bush said the team led by Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger that visited Panama this week had praised the Endaragovernment.   ``They are discussing housing programs, business development,bank loans that will help spur economic growth. We are committed tobe a part of that process,'' Bush said.   The president noted that he already has released nearly $400million in assets in U.S. banks that was frozen under the sanctionsagainst the Noriega regime.   U.S. officials involved in the discussions with Panama saidEndara did not present a laundry list of economic requests, butrather talked about general needs.   ``The Endara government has to sort out its priorities,'' saidone official, who also requested anonymity.   Just how much money the administration might find to help Panamais an unanswered question. Bush's press secretary, MarlinFitzwater, acknowledged this week that the current 1991 budget, tobe sent to Congress on Jan. 29, includes no money to help Panama.   The Endara government indicated to the Eagleburger team that itrecognizes that private businesses in Panama will play a major rolein restoring the economy and does not expect the U.S. governementto do everything, said one source.   It is expected the administration will turn to friends aroundthe world to help Panama. In particular, officials have mentionedJapan.   Japanese ambassador Ryohei Murata discussed the matter Fridaywith Vice President Dan Quayle.   Afterward, Quayle's press secretary, David Beckwith, said hecould not disclose the substance of the discussion other than tosay, ``The vice president complimented Japan for consideringextending aid.''   Japan retained its ties with the Noriega government despite U.S.urgings that the Tokyo government help isolate the dictator. Japanhas had substantial economic interests in Panama.</TEXT></DOC>
