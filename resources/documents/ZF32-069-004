(laser printers) (ComputerShopper Tech Section)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Veit, Stan.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The 1990 drop in laser printer prices to under $1000 for somemodels is a very significant one for the computer industry, forsome lucky home users will be able to afford to buy the machinesfor their home microcomputers.andP;  Microcomputer users originallydepended on the Teletype printer, which was loud and cost around$2,000 new.andP;  It printed 10 cps (characters per second) and wasalso used for mass storage and as a data-input device on the earlykit computers.andP;  It was followed by the kit printer from South WestTechnical Products, which cost only $250 but had to be assembled;it printed on a roll of cash-register paper.andP;  In the early 80s,Epson produced its popular Model 70 and 80 printers, priced under$1000 and able to print as fast as 80 cps.andP;  The evolution indot-matrix printers from 15 to 18 to 24 pins raised output qualitylevels as prices tended to drop.andP;  The new cheaper laser printersof 1991 are the latest chapter in this history of microcomputerprinting.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Market AnalysisHistory of ComputingPrintersCost ReductionLaser printers.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A historic moment in the personal computer world occurred during 1990, butvery few people noticed it, or marked it down for posterity.andP;  The laserprinter price level broke the $1,000 barrier for the first time.andM;Possibly only the sharp direct buyers who read Computer Shopper took a secondlook and said, &quot;Now I can get one to use at home!&quot;andP;  However, the demise ofthe One-Grand Barrier triggered in my memory a previous great event that nowseems quaint in comparison: the day the impact dot matrix printer price firstbroke this same barrier.andM;The first personal computer kits sold for around $500.andP;  Of course, you had toadd stuff that usually brought the price to around $700 ot $800, but eventhen there was still an expensive missing link that no one told you about.andO;There was no way to print affordable hard copy!andM;The device the most often used by computer owners, including most commercialinstallations, was the Teletype.andP;  The wonderful ASR-33 Teletype served as aprinter, a data-input device, and even the computer's mass storage.andP;  Itprinted a 10 characters per second (cps), and produced great noise and muchmovement of rolls of yellow paper.andP;  Nevertheless, you could clearly read itsoutput.andM;The only problem with the Teletype, besides its infernal noise, was itsprice: A new one cost about $2,000.andP;  Teletype Corp. sold them for about$1,700 each, but you had to buy them a year in advance, so they were sold onthe &quot;gray market&quot; for way above their factory price.andP;  Rebuilt ASR-33s couldbe bought for $1,200, but they weren't easy to come by.andM;MITS Altair made a deal to offer ASR-33 Teletypes to its customers for$1,500, minus an interface.andP;  You had to buy the Altair interface board to usethe Teletype, but it was still a great deal.andP;  Hobbyists often bought real oldjunker Teletypes that used Baudot code and wrote special conversion programsto convert the Baudot code into ASCII.andM;Real computer printers were so far out of the personal-computer user's reachthat they were not even thought of in conjunction with microcomputers.andO;Before I became involved with personal computers, I worked for a company thatmade computer printers.andP;  We made drum printers and they were considered to bevery low in cost.andP;  We had an 80-column, 150-line-per-minute printer for$10,000!andP;  In contrast, the Teletypes were really cheap.andM;Into this situation came South West Technical Products (SWTP), which hadalready made history with its M6800 computer and low-cost video terminal.andO;SWTP imported a printer mechanism developed for cash registers that couldprint 40 characters on a roll of cash-register paper.andP;  Using a 5x7 dot matrixprint head (moved by means of rotating cylinder with a spiral keyway), thePR-40 had a one-line, 40-character buffer memory and could print the64-character, ASCII uppercase set.andM;At a price of $250, the printer was only offered in kit form, but themechanism was completely constructed.andP;  For a long time, it represented theonly cheap printer for the microcomputer user.andM;The next company that tried to produce a low-cost printer for the hobbyistwas Integral Data Systems.andP;  It brought out a 7x9 dot matrix machine calledthe IP-225 Brighter Writer for $949, which could print a 96-character set onany width of paper up to 8.5 inches.andP;  It also came with either a serial orparallel interface and had such modern features as a line-feed button and aself-test button.andM;The IP-225 was driven by rather complicated software and very few users wereable to make it do all of the things the makers claimed it could.andP;  Inaddition, it was subject to mechanical failure when used too much.andP;  For mostpeople, the IP-225 was not a viable printer solution.andM;At the time, the primary company in the dot matrix printer business wasCentronics.andP;  The firm made heavy-duty computer printers used by most of theminicomputer manufacturers for applictions requiring speed and long printruns.andP;  However, a user had to choose between speed and quality.andM;If speed was necessary to print long reports or thousands of labels, youwould use a dot matrix printer.andP;  For quality printing, on the other hand, youhad one choice: a solid type machine using a daisywheel.andP;  The dot matrixprinter could operate at 300 to 600 cps, while the daisywheel machine's topspeed was 30 cps, and many of them only could only type at 10 or 20 cps.andM;The Centronics printers were sold at $2,000 to $6,000, depending on thefeatures included with them.andP;  The daisywheel machines sold for around $3,500.andO;Line printers sold for over $10,000.andM;By 1978, more and more personal computers came into use.andP;  Centronics saw thatthere was a potential market for a low-cost industrial-strength printer thatcould be used with the new computers.andP;  To tap this new market, it developed astripped-down model called the Model 779.andP;  This model was priced, inquantity, at less than $1,000 with friction feed.andP;  However, a single printerstill cost about $1,200.andM;The Model 779 became popular at the point when floppy disks were replacingcassettes for data storage and just when micro-computers were first beingused for real business applications.andM;The popularity of the Model 779 soon inspired competition from overseas.andP;  TheJapanese selected computer printers as their entry point for low-costcomputer peripherals, and the Epson Model 70 appeared in 1981 selling foronly $600.andM;By modern standards, the Model 70 was a rather poor printer constructed ofsheet metal and saddled with unreliable electronics.andP;  Still, money talks.andP;  Itwas cheap, it printed 80 columns of ASCII characters at a rate of about 60cps, and people bought them despite their defects.andP;  Soon Epson learned whatit took to make a reliable low-cost printer and withdrew the Model 70,replacing it with the Model 80.andM;The new printer was the perfect machine for the market: It was both low incost and reliable; it could print upper- and lowercase characters at 80 cps,and was available with tractor feed for a slightly higher price.andP;  The $1,000barrier was not only broken, it was smashed flat.andM;The Epson printers were so good that when IBM created the IBM PC, the companyselected it as the PC Printer, just adding some extrac characters to thecaracter set.andP;  Epson then offered the same printer as the MX-80 the mostpopular personal computer printer ever built.andM;After the MX-80, computer printers kept getting better while dropping inprice.andP;  Manufacturers figured out how to pack more pins into the print heads,and 9-pin printers became the standard, replacing the 7-pin models.andO;High-speed 120- to 180-cps dot matrix draft output, and near-letter-quality(NLQ) printing at lower speeds soon became common.andP;  NLQ printing was goodenough that high-cost daisywheel printers became virtually obsolete for mostapplications.andM;As progress marched on, print heads soon offered 15, 18, and then 24 pins.andO;With each step, the letter quality became better, and it became possible tooffer a wider variety of printing fonts.andP;  Daisywheel printers, which had soldfor $3,500, were being offered for less than $1,000 and finding few takers.andO;The final death blow to daisywheels was the fact that dot matrix printerscould also print graphic images and color type.andM;Then Apple and Hewlett-Packard combined laser electronics with theelectrostaticc plain-paper copier and produced the laser printer.andP;  Instantly,this became the new standard of quality.andP;  Laser printers could not onlyproduce letter quality, they could also print with near-typeset quality in avariety of fonts and graphic images.andP;  Today the laser printer is the mostdesired peripheral on the market, with only the high cost impeding itsuniversal application.andM;With an introductory price of over $6,000, the laser printer's price plungedas more manufacturers entered the market.andP;  Manufacturing economics being whatthey are, laser printers will never be as inexpensive as dot matrix printers,but the all-important One-Grand Barrier has been broken.andP;  While no one knowsexactly how much laser printers will cost a few years from now, there islittle doubt that they'll be more powerful, yet even cheaper.andM;Stand Veit is editor in chief emeritus of Computer Shopper.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
