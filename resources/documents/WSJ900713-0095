Allen Michels and Matthew Sanders, founders of a companythat became Stardent Computer Inc., filed the complaint in aCalifornia court yesterday, alleging that Kubota forced themerger that created the company. Kubota then began totransfer the technology to a wholly owned Kubota subsidiary,they allege.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a Trojan horse trick,&quot; said Joseph Alioto, thepair's attorney, who filed the suit in Superior Court inSanta Clara. Kubota, through its 22% stake in Stardent, tookcontrol of the company's technology, he said.   The suit, calling for $25 million in damages, charges theOsaka-based Kubota and several of its U.S. units with fraud,intentional misrepresentation and fraudulent concealment,among other allegations. Messrs. Michels and Sanders,co-chairmen of Stardent, also name Kubota president ShigekazuMino and other top Kubota executives in the suit.   &quot;We're very surprised here at this extremely sudden andunexpected suit,&quot; said a Kubota spokesman in Japan. He addedthat the company wouldn't have any added comment until it hadstudied the suit.   Kubota officials in the U.S. couldn't be reached forcomment.   The allegations are sure to fire up criticism thatJapanese investments in U.S. electronics and other technologycompanies drain the U.S. of valuable industrial assets.Critics of Japanese investment have suggested that someJapanese companies are seeking to carry innovative U.S.technology home to conglomerates that have a harder timecoming up with creative new ideas, but can easily translateothers' ideas into products.   Indeed, Kubota, a steel and farm-equipment maker, has beenat the forefront of the investment boom in the U.S. In themid-1980s, Kubota, along with other steel companies, set offon a course to survive by launching into new industries.   Kubota bought a stake in Ardent Computer Corp. ofSunnyvale, Calif., in 1986. Later, Ardent merged with StellarComputer Co. of Newton, Mass. to form Stardent.   Messrs. Michels and Sanders, in the suit, contend thatKubota forced the merger, threatening to let the companiesslide into financial ruin should they not agree. Stellar wason the brink of bankruptcy at the time, says Mr. Michels,Stardent's co-founder.   Mr. Alioto said Kubota recently set up Kubota ComputersAmerica in Sunnyvale to absorb Stardent's technology. Thesuit alleges that Kubota &quot;secretly planned to developproducts that would compete with Stardent,&quot; despiteagreements to the contrary, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
