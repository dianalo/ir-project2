(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Officials overwhelmed by the numbers ofpeople picked up drunk each year in this city bordering thenation's largest Indian tribe urged Congress to choose Gallup for apilot program to fight alcohol abuse.   Mayor Edward Munoz told a field hearing of the House Committeeon Interior and Insular Affairs that alcoholism is such anoverwhelming problem that it's beyond the resources of the localcommunity. Officials are hoping to get money to be able to treatalcoholics, rather than just have them put in a police departmentdrunk tank.   Munoz, who was re-elected last week following a campaign thatfocused in part on the alcoholism problem, called for cooperationbetween the city, state and federal governments and the Navajo andZuni tribes.   In the past, he said, efforts by Gallup to interest othergovernments in the fighting the problem has been met by``occasional rhetoric ... but seldom action.''   The city of 22,000 people is a major trade center for theadjacent Navajo Nation, and its population swells to double or eventriple daily. Since alcohol is prohibited on the reservations, anydrinking is done in Gallup.   The Navajo Nation, with 200,000 members, is the largest Indiantribe in the nation. About 165,000 of its members live on the125,000-square-mile reservation that spans portions of Utah,Arizona and New Mexico. The smaller Zuni Pueblo, also near Gallup,has a tribal membership of about 9,000.   City figures show 26,222 incidents of protective custody _ wheredrunks are put in a drunk tank by police while they sober up _ in1988 and more than 30,000 in 1987. A consultant estimated the 1987figure represented 5,000 to 7,000 people, each picked up an averageof four or more times.   Officials did not have a breakdown on how many of those takeninto protective custody are Indians, but said it was a significantfraction. The city wants to replace protective custody with adetoxification and treatment center.   Munoz told the hearing the city could commit $2.5 million inbonds toward building a center and some city money toward itsoperation, but would need state and federal assistance to handlethe estimated $4.2 million annual cost of running the center.   ``The history of this issue is one of finger-pointing andbuck-passing,'' the mayor said. He urged the congressmen at thehearing to move quickly.   Gallup Police Chief Frank Gonzales agreed that protectivecustody has become a revolving door and said detoxification was theonly way to break the cycle. But beyond treatment, he said, thecity has to have jobs and continued care for recovering alcoholics.   ``As long as we keep protective custody, we're not going tosolve the problem,'' he said. ``We're going to keep losing lives.Families are going to keep breaking up.''   The hearing marks the second time in recent weeks that Congresshas turned its attention to alcoholism in Gallup. Last month, NewMexico's senators, Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman, held aninformal fact-finding meeting in the community.   Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, chairman of Friday'shearing, said the New Mexico congressional delegation would beacting together in working on the issue.</TEXT></DOC>
