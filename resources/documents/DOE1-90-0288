A given mode of the scalar field isquantum mechanically excited when it is well within the Hubble radius(equivalentH{sub 0}/sup -1/) during the de Sitter phase of inflation.It then crosses outside the Hubble radius after which it is treated classically.Ultimately, long after reentering the Hubble radius, the fluctuationscorrespond to nonrelativistic scalar particles. The energy density inthese particles depends on the Hubble parameter during inflation, themass of the particle species, and the coupling of the scalar field tothe curvature scalar. The energy density may contribute significantlyto the total energy density in the Universe; in addition, new constraintsto the value of the Hubble constant during inflation follow. As an examplewe apply our results to axions.</TEXT></DOC>
