<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-0657 </DOCNO><TEXT>The mechanism of the interaction of iron(III) with polymeric ligands ofvibrous structure, viz., polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), a copolymer of polyvinylalcohol and polyacrylonitrile (PVA-PAN), and a thioamidated copolymerof polyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylonitrile (PVA-PAN-T), has been establishedby Moessbauer spectroscopy. It has been found that Fe(III) is partiallyor completely reduced to Fe(II) during sorption and that both forms ofiron coordinate the oxygen-containing functional groups of the polymers.</TEXT></DOC>
