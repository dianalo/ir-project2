On Friday Mr. Baker delivered the latest in a series ofAmerican snubs to the democratic government of Lithuania. Fortwo hours, he stood up Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene,whose country's program -- if implemented by like-mindedreformers throughout the Soviet Union -- threatens toundermine Soviet military power in much the same way that therise of East European democrats has made a hollow shell ofthe Warsaw Pact.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, Mr. Baker extended his meeting with PresidentMikhail Gorbachev, a man who seems determined to prevent justsuch a radical dismantling of Soviet might. According topress reports, at the appointed hour for his session withMrs. Prunskiene, the secretary was proposing a variety of&quot;breakthroughs,&quot; in a desperate bid to &quot;lock up&quot; arms-controldeals affecting strategic nuclear weapons, conventionalforces, chemical arms and nuclear testing prior to nextweek's Bush-Gorbachev summit in Washington.   Just as Mr. Baker has failed to grasp that the U.S. lackof support for Lithuania dramatically reduces the pressurefor radical political reform in Moscow, he seems equallyunaware that the arms-control agreements he personally hasdone so much to shape will preserve -- if not improve --Soviet military capabilities vis-a-vis the U.S. This resultis all too predictable given the structural problems,verification shortcomings and asymmetrical technologicaleffects of the incipient accords:                                                                                                          Strategic Arms Reduction Talks: The primary purpose of theSTART Treaty is the substantial reduction ofintercontinental-range nuclear arms. Obtaining such cutsbecame an &quot;idee fixe&quot; under the Reagan administration, whichcame to office critical of its Democratic predecessor'sinability to negotiate a SALT II accord that went beyondsimply limiting the further growth of Moscow's nuclearbuildup.   Unfortunately, along the way -- particularly under theBush administration -- the objective of reducing the size ofthe Kremlin's strategic arsenal became an end in itself,supplanting the ostensible goal of enhancing the U.S.deterrent at lower force levels. As a result, the STARTTreaty, as negotiated by Mr. Baker, is likely to give rise toan even larger ratio of Soviet weapons available to attack adiminishing number of American targets.   Moreover, the START Treaty is seriously deficient from averification standpoint. At next week's summit, Mr. Bush isexpected to sign a &quot;framework agreement&quot; on strategic armsthat immediately commits the U.S. to cutting programs andbudgets, but leaves crucial decisions on verification forlater.   It is apparent from the emerging framework agreement thatthe treaty will include provisions that will make a nightmareof attempts to verify Soviet compliance; some may actuallyinvite Soviet cheating. Particularly noteworthy was Mr.Baker's capitulation last September to Soviet demands thatthe U.S. drop its proposal to ban mobile intercontinentalballistic missiles. Moscow wants to keep at least 1,200 suchICBMs. With this legal infrastructure, it would have thepotential to support a far larger, covertly deployed mobileICBM force. For budgetary and operational reasons, the U.S.isn't likely to have a comparable legitimate system, to saynothing of an illegal inventory.   START also exemplifies another pernicious effect ofarms-control agreements: They tend to have a disproportionaleffect upon the area in which the U.S. has the greatestadvantage -- quality. For example, the constraints Mr. Bakeragreed to last week will limit the number and/or range oftechnologically sophisticated U.S. air-and sea-launchedcruise missiles.   The same insidious effect can also result from executiveor legislative branch actions taken to curb activities thatcould impinge upon implied treaty commitments. In thatregard, it is very likely that the agreement reached betweenMr. Baker and Mr. Gorbachev to exempt from START the currentversion of an extremely promising non-nuclear cruise missilesystem, called Tacit Rainbow, will be implemented by the U.S.government in such a way as to preclude potentially importantmodifications or derivatives.                                                                                                          Conventional Forces in Europe: Similar problems beset theeffort to negotiate reductions in NATO and Warsaw Pact forcesin Europe. From a structural standpoint, even a treatydesigned to produce essentially equal levels of American andSoviet troops and equipment will not correct an underlyinginequality -- namely, the geographic and strategicasymmetries arising from the Soviet Union's proximity to theEuropean theater on the one hand and the large ocean barrierseparating the U.S. from its allies on the other.   The CFE Treaty also faces an array of extraordinaryverification problems, none of which was addressed by Mr.Baker in Moscow. Not the least of these concerns is themonitoring of Soviet personnel and aircraft, which could bereinserted at will from territory outside the agreement'spurview. The CFE accord could also exacerbate the alreadyconsiderable impetus on Capitol Hill to reduce the number,quality and technological sophistication of U.S. conventionalforces in Europe.   The Soviets made it clear last week that they areunwilling to negotiate further cuts in conventional arms atthis time. They stood by this position despite Mr. Baker'sreported offer of no fewer than six significant concessionsin the CFE area. Mr. Baker said yesterday that Mr. Bush willpress Mr. Gorbachev next week to revive negotiations toremove tens of thousands of troops and tanks from Europe.   One possible explanation for the Soviet intransigence: Mr.Gorbachev believes that NATO is now in such disarray -- andthe U.S. is so obliged to disengage from the continent forbudgetary reasons -- that the need for a CFE agreement as aninstrument for reducing U.S. influence in Europe is much lessimportant than his need to preserve the Soviet militarypresence in Eastern Europe.   If so, it stands to reason that Mr. Gorbachev willsimilarly seek to suspend or stretch out the much moreimportant troop reduction agreements now in various stages ofdiplomatic evolution between Moscow and its erstwhile WarsawPact allies. Insofar as such accords promise to accomplishwhat CFE will not -- that is, the elimination of Sovietforces from East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary andBulgaria -- they are particularly susceptible to newstonewalling by the Kremlin.                                                                                                          Chemical Weapons: As a first step toward negotiation of aglobal ban on chemical arms, the U.S. and the Soviet Unionare expected to sign an accord next week requiring both sidesto destroy substantial parts (80% and 90%, respectively) ofdeclared, existing stockpiles of such weapons. The word&quot;declared&quot; is key because no provision is made in theagreement to establish whether the Soviets' announcedstockpiles conform to reality.   So deficient in this respect are the structural andverification aspects of this accord that the administrationhas taken an extraordinary step. Fearful that the pact couldnot muster the two-thirds majority required for the Senate'sconsent to a treaty, it will instead submit the document asan executive agreement -- the approval of which requires onlya simple majority in both houses of Congress. This is a verydangerous precedent for the even more unverifiablemultilateral ban on chemical weapons now in preparation.   Moreover, the administration acceded to Soviet pressure toterminate production of chemical munitions. This means thatthe U.S. will be permanently precluded from updating itsdeterrent capability.   It is bad enough that the U.S. has adopted such aposition, given that there are no provisions for verifyingthat the Soviet Union will likewise refrain from producingtoxic chemical agents. It is, however, absolutelyirresponsible for it to do so in the face of evidence ofproduction and deployment of chemical weapons by countriessuch as Libya, Syria and Iraq.                                                                                                          Nuclear Testing Protocol: Finally, Mr. Baker used theMoscow meeting to settle outstanding differences on aprotocol to the 1974 Threshold Test Ban Treaty (TTBT). Thisprotocol is supposed to improve the verifiability of theearlier accord, which limits U.S. and Soviet undergroundnuclear explosions to yields of 150 kilotons.   The real purpose of the protocol, however, is political.It is designed to allow enthusiasts for still morerestrictive limitations on nuclear testing to aver that theproblems with monitoring the existing pact have been solved.This would clear the way for negotiations to impose quotasand/or reduced thresholds -- if not an outright ban -- onsuch testing. As yesterday's revelations about safetyproblems with certain nuclear weapons makes clear, it isdifficult enough to maintain a safe and effective deterrenteven under the current underground testing regime. Shouldsuch testing be denied, however, matters would becomeinfinitely worse.   The testing procedures and mechanical arrangementsstipulated in the protocol, nominally in the interest offacilitating verification, will impose significant newconstraints on the U.S. use of testing as a means ofimproving the effectiveness of its nuclear and non-nuclearmilitary systems. Indeed, it appears that the Soviets havebeen particularly successful in this area in using anarms-control negotiation to constrain U.S. experimentalactivities vital to its technological superiority.   ---   Despite such serious flaws, all of these arms-controlagreements -- with the possible exception of understandingson conventional forces -- are virtually sure to be initialedat next week's summit. Having invested as much politicalcapital and personal prestige in arms negotiations as theyhave, neither Mr. Bush nor Mr. Baker is likely to letproblems with the substance of the agreements or criticism oftheir diplomacy interfere with the opportunity for a&quot;successful&quot; summit.   There is, however, a viable alternative to pursuingtraditional arms-control agreements with Moscow: The toppriority of the U.S. should be in joining forces with thosein Lithuania, Azerbaijan, Georgia and elsewhere who seek adismantling of the political and economic apparatus thatconstitutes the real source of the Soviet threat. If theSoviet Union's totalitarian and centralized system can besupplanted with a democratic, free-enterprise one, a sure andeffective control on Moscow's military will be put intoplace. That would be far better than any arms agreement.   ---   Mr. Gaffney, who was responsible for arms-control issuesas an official in the Reagan Defense Department, directs theCenter for Security Policy in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
