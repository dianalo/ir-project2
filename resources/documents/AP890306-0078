RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People accused of driving under the influenceof alcohol generally are not entitled to jury trials, a unanimousSupreme Court ruled today.   The court, in a case from Nevada, said states are not required tohold jury trials for drunken driving when the maximum jail terms aresix months and other penalties are not particularly severe.   The court left open the possibility the Constitution mightrequire a jury trial in the case of a repeat offender who could besentenced to more than six months in jail if convicted of drivingunder the influence more than once.   In another case, the court turned down an appeal by northeasternstates seeking to force the federal government to crack down on acidrain and other pollution they say is caused by smokestacks in otherstates.   The court, without comment, refused to order the federalEnvironmental Protection Agency to take steps to limit interstateair pollution.   The justices rejected an appeal by two Nevada men, Melvin R.Blanton and Mark D. Fraley, who said the penalties for beingconvicted of driving under the influence (DUI) are serious enough towarrant jury trials.   Lawyers for the two said Nevada is one of only five states thatdo not permit jury trials in such cases. They listed the otherstates as Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey and New Mexico.   While there is mounting national concern over the seriousness ofdrunken driving, Justice Thurgood Marshall said for the court Mondaythat Nevada classifies driving under the influence as a petty crime.   The demarcation line for petty crimes is a maximum sentence ofsix month in jail, Marshall said. The fact that Nevada prescribesother penalties does not raise the offense to a serious crime, hesaid.   Nevada law provides that a first-time DUI offender can besentenced to 48 hours of community work rather than jail. Theoffender must be dressed as a DUI offender while doing the work.   The state law also imposes a maximum fine of $1,000, requiresoffenders to attend alcohol abuse edcuation courses and suspendstheir drivers' licenses for 90 days.   Also, first-time offenders face a minimum sentence of two days injail.   Marshall said, ``Primary emphasis must be placed on the maximumauthorized period of incarceration.'' Generally, he said, ``adefendant is entitled to a jury trial whenever the offense for whichhe is charged carries a maximum authorized prison term of greaterthan six months.''   Blanton was arrested in North Las Vegas on July 18, 1986, andFraley was arrested in the same town on June 29, 1986. Blanton hasnot been tried. Fraley was convicted and was sentenced to two daysin jail and fined $310.   The Nevada Supreme Court ruled in 1987 that they were notentitled to jury trials. The state court said jury trials wouldplace an expensive burden on the municipal court system.   In other action, the court:   _ Agreed to review the stiff fines imposed against four Yonkers,N.Y., councilmen for defying a federal judge's order to adopt ahousing desegregation plan.   The justices said they will study arguments that the judgeexceeded his power in imposing the contempt-of-court fines.   _ Said federal workers do not have a right to sue in federalcourt when they accuse the union representing them of unfairtreatment.   The justices, voting 9-0, ruled that the only recourse for theemployees in such cases is to file an unfair labor practice chargewith the Federal Labor Relations Authority.   _ Agreed to decide whether prison inmates are entitled to a courthearing and other safeguards before being forced to takeanti-psychotic drugs.   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Washington stateofficials who say judges should not be allowed to interfere with theprofessional judgment of prison administrators and doctors.   _ Barred a lawsuit against a former federal prosecutor whorefused police protection to a witness gunned down before she couldtestify.   The justices, without comment, let stand a ruling that theprosecutor was not legally responsible to protect the woman, killedin New York City along with three CBS employees who tried to come toher aid.   _ Turned down the free-speech arguments of a financial magazineaccused of violating an anti-touting provision of federal securitieslaw.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that could forceThe Stock Market Magazine to tell readers whether companies featuredin its articles bought advertising space or paid the magazine forother services.   _ Said a contract dispute between Stanford University and acomputer firm should be settled in state court, not in arbitration.   The court's 6-2 decision is a victory for Stanford and a setbackfor Volt Information Sciences Inc., which had asked the justices tocompel arbitration.   The drunken-driving case is Blanton vs. North Las Vegas, 87-1437.</TEXT></DOC>
