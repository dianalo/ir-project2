Harris Jr. (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MEGA GPO BRRS </CO><IN> TNM PUB </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Burt Sugarman, the Hollywood producer who is offering $1.57 billion for Media General Inc., said he had devised a way to break the veto power held by Media General's powerful Bryan family.    Media General promptly responded, however, that its counsel believes Mr. Sugarman is &quot;incorrect&quot; in his contention that the Bryan-controlled Class B stock loses its special voting rights in the case of a merger that would leave Media General as the surviving company. Media General President James S. Evans said that any merger still would &quot;require the vote of two-thirds of each class of its stock,&quot; both the 27.7 million Class A shares, and the Class B stock. About 70% of Media General's more than 500,000 Class B shares is owned by the Bryan family foundation, whose sole trustees are Media General Chairman D. Tennant Bryan and his son, Vice Chairman J. Stewart Bryan. After Mr. Sugarman made his bid late last month, the Bryans said their Media General interests &quot;aren't for sale, at any price.&quot;    Media General had cited the Bryan family's response in declining to take any specific action on the $61.50-a-share bid from the companies that Mr. Sugarman controls, Beverly Hills-based Barris Industries Inc. and Giant Group Ltd.    But in a letter to Mr. Evans, Mr. Sugarman emphasized that Media General would be the surviving entity under his Feb. 29 merger proposal, and said that his companies had recently increased their stake above 10%. As a result, provisions of Media General's charter require that &quot;all classes of stock shall vote proportionately on an acquisition by Media General involving a shareholder owning at least 10% of the stock of any class,&quot; he said.    While the Bryans control the Class B stock, he said, those shares represent less than 2% of total Media General equity, and the Bryan family's holding of Class A and B stock together is about 12% of equity.    Therefore, Mr. Sugarman asserted, in a vote giving each Class B and Class A share a single vote, the family's shares wouldn't be &quot;in a position to block our proposal.&quot; He asked for a response to the bid from Media General no later than Monday.    Mr. Sugarman disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing yesterday that recent purchases have boosted the combined Barris and Giant Class A stake to 10.1% from the previous 9.8%.    An attorney representing Barris and Giant Group said the maneuver by Mr. Sugarman was &quot;neither a trick nor a trap.&quot; The attorney, Edward Brodsky of the New York firm of Spengler, Carlson, Gubar, Brodsky andamp; Frischling, said a disclosure wasn't made of Mr. Sugarman's plans for Media General to be the surviving company, because &quot;we didn't have more than 10% of the stock (at that time), so this provision of the charter wouldn't have applied.&quot;    Mr. Brodsky said he doubted the action by Mr. Sugarman's companies had surprised Media General, because &quot;the charter provision has been there for 20 years.&quot; And an acquisition proposal that evisions the target as the surviving company, he added, is &quot;nothing unusual.&quot;    In American Stock Exchange composite trading, Media General shares closed at $47, up 50 cents.    The bid for Media General by Barris and Giant Group has been seen as the first attempt by a potential acquirer to defeat the two-class stock structure that many media and other concerns have installed as a defense against hostile takeovers. Mr. Sugarman previously has said Media General was particularly vulnerable to a legal challenge because the Bryan family's disproportionate power through the Class B stock contrasted so sharply with its Class A holdings.    Other media concerns in which Class B shares have disproportionate voting power include Times Mirror Co., New York Times Co., Washington Post Co. and Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper.    Mr. Sugarman said yesterday that a lawsuit challenging Media General's stock structure hadn't been filed, though he left open the possibility if a favorable response to his bid isn't received Monday. &quot;If the board of Media General now permits the Bryan family to prevent the shareholders from considering the merits of our merger proposal, they will be breaching their fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders,&quot; he said in his letter to Mr. Evans.    In another shot at Media General's stock structure, the letter contended that a Media General charter amendment last year allows the Bryans to convert Class B shares to Class A shares and still to retain 70% voting control as long as they hold a single Class B share. Shareholders who approved the amendment, Mr. Sugarman said, hadn't been told that the Bryan family stock wasn't for sale. </TEXT></DOC>
