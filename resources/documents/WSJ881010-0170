Sahlen Jr., chairman and president, said.    However, he said he can't specify the amount of profit because the security and investigative-services concern hasn't yet determined the size of adjustments resulting from Sahlen's June 30 acquisition of Hanson PLC's Globe Security Systems Inc. unit for $46.5 million.    Mr. Sahlen said in an interview that the company expects to report fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of &quot;over $16 million,&quot; up sharply from $9.1 million in the year-earlier period. He said revenue for fiscal 1988 was &quot;over $54 million,&quot; up from $21.9 million in fiscal 1987. The figures don't include operations of Philadelphia-based Globe, which has annual sales of $125 million.    For fiscal 1989, Mr. Sahlen predicted per-share net income of &quot;20 cents plus&quot; on revenue &quot;in excess of&quot; $200 million. In fiscal 1987, net was $1.3 million, or 16 cents a share, including an extraordinary tax credit of $315,777.    Mr. Sahlen said consolidation of operations with Globe &quot;has gone exceptionally well,&quot; adding that the two companies have implemented cost-cutting measures, such as eliminating duplicate executive positions and combining some offices, that are expected to save $4 million during fiscal 1989. He said those moves will have &quot;real impact by the third and fourth quarters.&quot;    Mr. Sahlen added that the company formed a corporate business-development group last month to attract large corporate clients. He said the effort &quot;is going well so far&quot; and that &quot;synergism has started to work already.&quot;    Sahlen currently has 90 offices, including 55 dedicated to the security business and 35 to investigations, up from a total of 38 a year ago, Mr. Sahlen said.    He said the company's investigative unit is widening its business to include more &quot;specialty&quot; work, including financial inquiries, mergers and acquisition investigations and white-collar crime-detection work. He said about 20% of Sahlen's investigative work is in these fields, up from about 10% a year ago.    In Friday's national over-the-counter trading, Sahlen shares closed at $1.8125, down 6.25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
