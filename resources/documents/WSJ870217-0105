The step-up in rank promised more meaningful duties for the 14-year police veteran and a $7,000-a-year pay raise, but Mr. Brown turned down the promotion. &quot;It wasn't a difficult decision,&quot; he told the New York Post. &quot;I just don't believe in racial quotas.&quot;    The quota Mr. Brown referred to was imposed on the New York Police Department in 1983 to settle a lawsuit brought by black and Hispanic officers. The minority officers contended that the test administered to sergeant candidates was discriminatory because the failure rates for blacks and Hispanics were disproportionately higher than the rate for whites.    The city devised a new test for sergeants -- a test that was job specific and that was approved by representatives of the black and Hispanic officers. Yet the minority candidates still did poorly. The minority officers complained again -- not that the test was discriminatory, but that the results were.    The city acquiesced, promoting candidates according to numerical quotas, regardless of how the minority officers performed on the objective test. Promotions were offered to 94 blacks, 89 of whom had failing grades, and 66 Hispanics, 34 with failing grades. As for Mr. Brown, he scored higher than the cutoff mark for promoted blacks, but lower than the cutoff for white officers. He vowed to take the test again rather than accept a promotion he felt he did not deserve on merit.    Officer Brown's principled stand may reflect shifting minority sentiments about racial quotas. Opinion surveys have consistently shown most blacks and other minorities to be very much opposed to racial preferences in hiring and college placement (most recently, a 1985 poll by the Center for Media and Public Affairs). Increasingly, minorities are questioning whether the stigma of undeservedness is a reasonable price to pay for racial preferences.    Quotas are double-edged. They can work to the benefit of certain preferred groups, but they can also work to their detriment. Nowhere is this more evident than in higher education. Quotas have been used to increase some under-represented minorities on campuses, but they're also being covertly used now to prevent disproportionate representation of specific minorities.    The group most victimized by these &quot;reverse quotas&quot; are Asian-Americans, who lately have been outperforming most other ethnic groups in academics, especially in math and science. Asians are vastly over-represented at many elite schools. (At Harvard, for instance, Asians make up 10% of the student body, some five times their share of the U.S. population.) It is widely believed that admissions officers at some schools are now using informal quotas, not to help this minority but to hinder it. Such perverse consequences are built into the complex mechanics of quota policy.    Most minorities, most Americans, do not believe in special preferences. What they do believe in is equal opportunity for all, regardless of ethnicity. By emphasizing and urgently promoting equal opportunity instead of equal results, or quotas, we place achievement where it belongs -- within each individual, performing to the best of his or her ability. </TEXT></DOC>
