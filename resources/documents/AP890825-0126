Mazowiecki met with Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, SenateMinority leader Robert Dole and three Democratic congressmen. Helater met with the Soviet ambassador and West German envoys.   Mrs. Dole said after the meeting with the prime minister thatWashington would consider new ways to aid the country, but would notsay whether that included additional financial assistance.   Mazowiecki assumed office on Thursday in a historic transfer ofpower from the Communist Party to a Solidarity-led coalition, thefirst government led by non-Communists in the East bloc.   Walesa, who convinced Communist President Wojciech Jaruzelski toapprove the Solidarity-led government, said in a statement Fridaythat Mazowiecki's selection was the ``breakthrough'' needed to stopPoland's economic decline.   Walesa said dramatic changes were needed by the government butcalled on workers to limit strikes to avoid causing further economicdamage.   ``In face of so critical an employment situation, radical actionsof the government are needed. At the same, we must radically limiteconomic losses which are an ovbious result of any strikestruggle,'' he said in a statement.   ``We must save Poland not at the cost of other people buttogether,'' he said.   In a rare show of support that would have been unthinkable onlymonths ago, Communist Party chief Miezcyslaw F. Rakowski, who is onan official visit to Bulgaria, sent Mazowiecki a telegram Fridaysaying the new prime minister could count on the party's support``in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis.''   Dole, R-Kansas, said Mazowiecki told him: ```He who helps early,helps twice.' In other words, this is very important now to keep upthe momentum and let the Polish people see some change.''   But Mrs. Dole was cautious about offering more financial aid toPoland.   ``Obviously, we do have a budget deficit at home,'' she said.``We will provide aid as we can, when we can, but there is already avery significant program underway.''   She was referring to Bush's $115 million aid offer made during aJuly visit. Solidarity leaders have been hoping for a $10 billionassistance package from Western countries.   Later, the Doles met for over an hour with Jaruzelski. Mrs. Dolesaid they delivered a letter from President Bush to Jaruzelskicongratulating him ``on his wisdom and his leadership in thisdifficult time, this time of transition and the progress that isbeing made in forming a new government, his cooperation in thatprocess.''   She said a similar letter was delivered to Mazowiecki.   At Mazowiecki's meeting with Soviet Ambassador Vladimir Brovikov,the ambassador congratulated Mazowiecki on his election andMazowiecki sent greetings to the Soviet people, a governmentspokesman said.   Mazowiecki's election has brought reserved support from theSoviet Union.   Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said Friday inMoscow that Soviet officials were ``happy to hear'' Mazowiecki'sremarks Thursday about Poland remaining in the Warsaw Pact andComecon socialist economic alliance.   ``The sensible and constructive approach by the head of thePolish government to these issues, which have paramount significancefor the peoples of the two countries, coincides with our wishes,''Gremitskikh said.   Mrs. Dole said Bush would soon send a team of U.S. experts toPoland to study what priorities such aid would take.   Referring to unemployment that will result as inefficientindustries are closed under economic reform plans, she said Polandwould have to lay ``a safety net for workers as they go through thistransition, which obviously is going to produce difficulties.''   Mazowiecki also met U.S. Sens. Dennis DeConcini of Arizona andFrank Lautenberg of New Jersey, and U.S. Rep. Jim Moody ofWisconsin, all Democrats. The three represent the congressionalcommittee that oversees compliance with the Helsinki accords onhuman rights.   DeConcini called Mazowiecki's election ``a wager on freedom wecannot afford to lose,'' and said he would return to the UnitedStates to support increased aid to Poland.   Wales, in his statement, appealed to striking railway workers inthe central city of Lodz to stop their protest.   ``I turn to Lodz railwaymen to display resolve in stopping theincreasingly dangerous strike in the region. A strike action ... nowhas a character of a provocation aimed against the first primeminister elected at Solidarity's initiative,'' he said.   Communist Party First Secretary Miezcyslaw F. Rakowski, who is onan official visit to Bulgaria, sent Mazowiecki a telegram Fridaysaying the new prime minister could count on the party's support``in everything aiming at leading the country out of the crisis.''</TEXT></DOC>
