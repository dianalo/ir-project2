Last week prices fell as traders feared the Agriculture Department reports would be even worse than analysts estimated. Now there is &quot;overall exuberance that the cattle report wasn't worse,&quot; said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.    Yesterday, cattle for August delivery rose 1.12 cents a pound to 61.62 cents. Cattle for October and December delivery were up the daily limit of 1.5 cents a pound. There is some concern about tightness in fourth-quarter supplies.    The 13-state quarterly report, released after Friday's close of trading, said placements of animals on feedlots in the second quarter rose 14% from a year earlier, movement of animals to slaughter fell 3% and the total population on feed as of July 1 was up 9%.    Meanwhile, the seven-state monthly report said placements on feedlots rose 26% from a year earlier, movement of animals to slaughter rose 3% and the number of animals on feed as of July 1 rose 10%.    The weight breakdowns in the quarterly report could signal tight beef supplies in the fourth quarter, said Joel Karlin, director of research at Jack Carl/312 Futures Inc. in Chicago. The report indicates that the animals on feedlots need fattening before they are ready for slaughter.    Meanwhile, the weekend's scorching weather and the strong cattle market lifted hog prices, analysts said. The heat reduces the animals' weight gain.    A small cold storage inventory figure from the Agriculture Department, along with a continued smaller-than-expected slaughter, helped pork belly prices finish higher. As of June 30 there were 47.4 million pounds of pork bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, in storage-down 23% from 61.6 million pounds a year earlier, the Agriculture Department said.    In other futures markets:   COCOA: Futures prices eased in the wake of weekend rain in West African cocoa-growing areas -- particularly in the eastern section in Ivory Coast, where it was most needed, analysts said. Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer. September cocoa fell $16 a metric ton to $2,031. Prices have been falling since July 17, and yesterday they dipped as low as $2,016, for a total nine-day decline of $134. Two weeks ago dry weather that could damage the cocoa crop was a major prop for prices. However, an analyst said, if moisture continued to be sufficient, the crop could recover from the effects of the dry spell. &quot;In that case,&quot; he said, &quot;we are back under the influence of the supply-demand situation, which is bearish because of an overabundance of cocoa beans.&quot;    COFFEE: A combination of mild weather in Brazilian coffee-growing areas that continued to allay frost concerns and indications that Brazil still has a lot of coffee to ship put pressure on futures prices. September coffee fell 2.62 cents a pound to $1.0391. Brazil said over the weekend that it would no longer accept registrations of coffee to be shipped in August. Brazil opened August and September registrations just over a week ago, and September registrations were closed the same day they opened, after 2.4 million bags were registered. The books for August remained open all week, and ultimately 1.9 million bags were registered. August registrations lagged behind because this is the quiet time of the year in the industry, particularly in Europe, industry executives said. Demand begins to pick up in September, they said, and the talks that month in London about reinstating export quotas adds some uncertainty, which translates into better demand for September delivery.    ENERGY: Oil futures prices, which have been volatile of late, closed narrowly mixed in lackluster trading. Many traders apparently have retreated from the market for the time being, uncertain about its direction, brokers and analysts said. &quot;A lot of big players are going to wait and see where a trading range is ironed out,&quot; said a trader at the New York Mercantile Exchange. &quot;Right now, it's a little bit too risky to get too long or too short,&quot; he said. September crude oil on the New York Merc slipped eight cents a barrel to $20.49. Most heating oil contracts posted small gains, while unleaded gasoline futures prices were mixed. Meanwhile, the spot, or noncontract, price of West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, fell five cents a barrel to $20.50. Traders continue to monitor the U.S. escort of Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf, as well as output by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which some industry executives have estimated to be almost two million barrels a day more than the cartel's quota of 16.6 million barrels.    FOREIGN CURRENCIES: Japanese yen futures led other foreign currency futures prices downward in thin trading. The price moves were based mainly on technical factors and a slight rebound in the dollar in the cash market, said Michael Ptack, senior market analyst at Gartman Financial Services Inc. in Portsmouth, Va. As the dollar rebounded through the psychologically important 150 yen level in the cash market, other foreign currency futures declined as well. Yen for September delivery, which closed down 0.0029 at 0.6675, may fall to 0.6500 before rebounding, Mr. Ptack said. The report of a 0.4% increase in personal income in June didn't affect foreign currency futures prices, traders said. </TEXT></DOC>
