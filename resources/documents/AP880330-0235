Government and rebel representatives ended two days of technicalmeetings Tuesday night by agreeing to set up five zones in whichthe rebels were to gather on Friday, the start of the cease-fire.   An agreement signed last week by the leftist Sandinistagovernment and the Contras called for the cease-fire in an effortto end more than six years of war.   Both sides declared a truce March 21, the start of theunprecedented talks that produced the fragile peace agreement. Butreports reaching the capital this week indicated several violationsby the Contras.   A transcript of a broadcast Wednesday by the rebel's clandestineRadio September 15 said: ``Nicaraguan Resistance commandos causecasualties to the pro-Soviet army.''   It was not clear how the reported violations would affect peacetalks.   According to the transcript, the Honduras-based radio stationreported three attacks by Contra troops on government soldiers inZelaya province along the Caribbean coast and in northern Matagalpaprovince. It did not say when the raids took place.   The Defense Ministry said it had no reports of combat. But thepro-Sandinista newspaper El Nuevo Diario quoted unidentifiedmilitary sources as saying Contra rebels killed four civilians andkidnapped two Saturday in central Chontales province.   There also have been reports that renegade rebels opposed to thecease-fire agreement are staging attacks.   A communique at the end of technical talks held Monday andTuesday in the southern border town of Sapoa said the two sides hadagreed in general terms on the size and location of the cease-firezones.   Two zones will be in the northern part of the country, two onthe Caribbean coast and one in the south, it said. Their exactlocations were not disclosed.   Last week's peace pact does not mention the laying down of arms,an issue that will likely be discussed in the next technicalmeeting, set for April 5, or discussions scheduled for April 6 inManagua between high-ranking Sandinista and Contra leaders.   On Monday, Contra commander Diogenes Hernandez Membreno, knownas Fernando, vowed that the combatants would not put down theirarms ``until Nicaragua is a democracy.''   Under the peace agreement, the Sandinistas will grant freedom ofexpression, release political prisoners and allow rebel leaders totake part in national talks. The Contras, in turn, agreed to gatherin the cease-fire zones and accept only humanitarian aid from aneutral organization, such as the International Red Cross.   In Washington, the House if Representatives overwhelminglyapproved a $48 million package of humanitarian aid Wednesday forthe Contras and for children injured in the fighting.   The bill was portrayed as a gesture of U.S. support for thetemporary truce and for continuing talks aimed at achieving along-term end to hostilities.   U.S. aid to the Contras ended Feb. 29.   In Miami, the chief Contra military field commander, Col.Enrique Bermudez, told reporters he supports the truce agreementand will comply with it. He has expressed reservations, saying hedoesn't trust the Sandinistas, but he said Wednesday his concernsdo not mean he opposes Contra leadership on the issue.   The transcript of the rebel radio broadcast Wednesday cautionedContra combatants that agents of the ``communist Sandinistadictatorship'' were telling troops the war had ended and theyshould put down their arms.   ``The arms of the commandos of liberty are the only guaranteefor the Nicaraguan people, and these (arms) will never be turned inwhile Nicaragua is not a free and just democracy,'' it said.   Most Nicaraguans turned their thoughts away from the war andbegan vacations to mark Holy Week. Many looked for gasoline, whichis in short supply, to fuel their trips to the Pacific coastalbeaches.   Banks, government offices, stores and most restaurants closed onWednesday.   La Prensa, the opposition newspaper, took the rest of the weekoff, citing a shortage of Soviet-supplied newsprint. The twogovernment papers were closed until Monday.</TEXT></DOC>
