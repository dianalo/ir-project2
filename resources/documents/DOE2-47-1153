The 1986 production exceeded 3.5 millionbarrels per day, accounting for 8% of the total production of the freeworld. The NS field broke the ice in reducing crude oil prices. The quickoil price drop in early 1986 was led by Brent Crude Oil, a representativeof the NS field. Brent's for-ward-delivery price serves as an importantindex in determining crude oil prices. Most of NS oil is exported. TheNS oil price drop shocked the Norwegian economy. NS oil production eithercomplies with demand or is reduced in accordance with the OPEC guideline.Production costs (capital plus running costs) are 11 dollars per barrelin oil-producing fields and 16 dollars per barrel in fields being developed.Exploration has stagnated but is still carried out with high efficiency.This has enabled large fields to be discovered. Production is expectedto increase from 3.5 million barrels per day at present to 3.7 millionbarrels per day in 1989, reaching its peak. Then, production will stayabout 3.5 million barrels per day until somewhere around 1993. Reservethat has been discovered exceed 15 billion barrels in Great Britain and10 billion barrels in Norway.
