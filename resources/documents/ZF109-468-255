SOFTWARE BRIDGE 4.1andM;Software Bridge is one of the more capable and accurate translation programsreviewed.andM;The program uses a separate executable program for each type of wordprocessor.andP;  A single program provides both the source and target translationfunctions.andM;Software Bridge is distributed on six disks.andP;  Two of them, designated thesystem disks, contain the main program and separate definition files for eachword-processor program.andP;  Only the definition files for the word-processingprograms being translated need to be present on the working disk.andP;  Ideally,however, the full contents of both disks are loaded on a hard disk.andM;The four remaining floppy disks contain conversion programs for the variousword processors.andP;  The programs tend to be small--typically 70K bytes to 80Kbytes.andP;  Only those conversion programs being used need to be copied to theworking disk.andM;Nothing in the Software Bridge installation process is automated.andP;  Thepackage requires the user to determine the name of the conversion program forthe desired word processor, identify which conversion disk the program fileis on from a list in the manual, and then copy the program from thedistribution disk to a working disk.andM;The strength of Software Bridge lies in its customization capability.andP;  Eachword-processor combination can have both a character filter and type-stylefilter associated with it.andP;  Although developing a complete filter for everycharacter can be tedious--even with Software Bridge's automated creation/editprocess--it provides a flexibility not present in the other packages.andM;Software Bridge's ability to create a type-style filter enabled it to be theonly package of the group that successfully translated the font changes in PCWeek Labs' tests.andP;  The type-style filters are based on the printer driverfiles associated with each word processor, allowing the program to requestand interpret the driver files to determine available fonts.andM;Once the installation hurdles have been overcome and the correct conversionprograms have been identified, located and copied, the operation of SoftwareBridge is effortless.andP;  Like Word for Word, Software Bridge automaticallyrecognizes the format of the source word processor.andM;The automatic-recognition capability is put to good use in Software Bridgewith a viewing function.andP;  This allows tagged document files to be viewed in areadable form to quickly determine the file contents.andM;Software Bridge is the second fastest of the reviewed packages, followingjust behind Word for Word.andM;The Software Bridge documentation is adequate for the task of operating theprogram.andP;  It makes good use of screen displays and has a credible index.andO;Several pages are devoted to translation of documents to and from Macintoshword processors.andM;Systems Compatibility Corp., located in Chicago, can be reached at (312)329-0700.andM;Buyers say ...andM;Bill Nixon, an analyst for the Appellate Automation Support Division for theState of New York Court System in Albany, uses Software Bridge to convertfiles from MultiMate to WordPerfect.andM;&quot;MultiMate is easier for people to use out in the field, but the way itstores footnotes is difficult to translate,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[Software Bridge] isthe only package that brought text between MultiMate and WordPerfect.&quot;andM;With Software Bridge, footnotes appear in WordPerfect as text rather than asa separate file, as they appear in MultiMate, according to Nixon.andM;&quot;WordLink doesn't support MultiMate footnotes at all--it just skips them.andO;With Software Bridge, with minor editing, the document is usable,&quot; Nixonsaid.andM;Malcolm Pritchard, senior research chemist at Akzo Chemicals Inc., a researchlab in McCook, Ill., looked at Word for Word and Software Bridge to find aproduct to translate WordStar, WordPerfect and DisplayWrite documents on aNovell NetWare LAN.andM;The best feature of Software Bridge's latest version is document recognition,according to Pritchard.andM;&quot;In general, it tends to cope with the things thrown at it.andP;  [The currentversion] only goes up to WordStar 5.5--it doesn't always recognize a WordStar6.0 document,&quot; Pritchard said.andM;&quot;The most awkward part is the setup, when you have to change to a differentword processor.andP;  For people who aren't very computer literate, it's not veryintuitive.andP;  I tend to have to help users from time to time,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
