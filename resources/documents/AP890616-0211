(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Goldome today rescinded its policy ofrequiring laid-off workers to sign an agreement promising not totalk to the media about losing their jobs in order to receive fullseverance pay.   The policy had embittered current and former employees who feltthe company was threatening laid-off workers.   Goldome Chief Executive Officer Thomas Cooper said, ``Ourintention, to help assure the confidentiality of employee, customerand corporate information ... has been submerged by misperceptionsof the agreement. This makes its continued use counterproductive.''   As many as 150 people had been terminated in recent weeks andasked to sign the ``Release and Confidentiality Agreement,'' whichprevented them from suing Goldome or discussing their layoff withanyone except ``counsel, personal tax adviser, immediate family oras required by law.''   If laid-off employees refused to sign, their severance benefitswould have been cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six.   Sources within the company said management thought news ofGoldome's layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from thebank.   Although many companies require new employees to signconfidentiality agreements, it is highly unusual for a company torequire terminated employees to sign such an agreement as acondition of receiving severance pay.   ``It's not illegal, but I wouldn't consider it morally right,''said an analyst with Mercer, Meidinger and Hansen, a leading humanresources consulting firm in Washington.   Nearly all of Goldome's laid-off workers signed the agreement,sources said.   The confidentiality requirement came after the company reducedits severance policy May 1. Companies are not required by law toprovide any severance pay, but most offer it as part of a benefitspackage to attract qualified employees and as a humanitarian gesture.   Goldome, which lost $119 million last year, is in the middle of arestructuring effort.</TEXT></DOC>
