Most agricultural lenders, however, don't see clear signs of a banking recovery. Although prices for farm land have flattened in some areas after a six-year free-fall, they aren't expected to rise substantially anytime soon from their rock-bottom levels. Such prices are a principal barometer of the health of agricultural banks.    &quot;We think we have seen a floor in land prices,&quot; said Alvin Christianson, president of the Farmers andamp; Merchants Bank of Preston, Minn. &quot;But there's nothing to back up a rally.&quot; The bank, which has posted losses since 1985, is nearing break-even, he said.    Indeed, only Washington's massive infusion of federal money into the farm economy is preventing land prices from falling further. &quot;Government payments have created a theoretical artificial floor for land values,&quot; said Bill BeSore, chief financial officer of Farm Credit System Capital Corp., which administers the bad assets of the Farm Credit System, a banking confederation that is regulated by the federal Farm Credit Administration. &quot;If there are significant changes in the (government) programs, that would be negative -- especially for wheat and corn land,&quot; Mr. BeSore said.    Nevertheless, the steadying of the farm real estate market is easing pressure on farm banks. According to the latest Federal Reserve Board data compiled by Veribanc Inc., a Woburn, Mass., consulting concern, the number of farm banks with problem loans exceeding their capital -- the leading indicator of failure -- was 184 on March 31, as it was on Dec. 31.    A farm bank is defined as one with 25% or more of its loans made to farmers. The number of imperiled farm banks peaked at 230 on June 30, 1986.    What's more, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said it expects the rate of farm bank failures to ease through the rest of this year. Through last week, 32 farm banks had failed in 1987, compared with 59 for all of 1986.    Lynn Nejezchleb, an FDIC economist, said firming prices for the land used as collateral on many loans has halted the deterioration of loan portfolios. &quot;It has stopped the situation from getting worse,&quot; he said.    According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, the average price of farm land on March 31 in its region, which covers most of five Midwestern states, has risen 0.4% from Dec. 31. That was the first increase since the first half of 1983, when a one-year government program briefly halted the slide that began in 1981 and depressed prices to 33% to 50% of peak levels.

The Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo., said the average value of non-irrigated land in its region, which covers seven states, rose a few dollars in the first quarter to $398 an acre. Second-quarter land prices, which will be reported in late August, are expected to change little. &quot;We see a broad flat bottom,&quot; said Alan Barkema, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank.    The leveling of farm real estate prices is also allowing banks to begin selling some of their huge holdings of repossessed land, which shows up as a nonearning asset on their books. According to a Veribanc study, the amount of land held by farm banks on March 31 slipped 6% from Dec. 31. That was the second consecutive quarterly decline.    Land sales are sluggish, however, because of fears that land prices will drop if the banks unload too much land -- a hazard farm lenders are taking unusual steps to avoid. The Farmers Home Administration, a division of the Department of Agriculture, held 1.6 million acres of land at the end of May, and will sell only to the least credit-worthy farmers in order to avoid competing with private banks that are also trying to sell land. &quot;That prevents us from taking buyers away from other property,&quot; said Chris Beyerhelm of the agency's Iowa office.    Some lenders' efforts to reduce farm land holdings, however, have been a wash; many have taken possession of as much additional farm land as they have been able to sell. Last month, BankAmerica Corp. took 40,000 acres of land to settle debts by Salyer American, one of California's biggest growers. &quot;We've been selling land and taking it back,&quot; a spokesman for the San Francisco-based bank said. &quot;So we have been unable to drop the inventory.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
