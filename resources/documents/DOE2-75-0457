This is an importantsubject since protective equipment will go into operation if specificlimits are exceeded or undershot. This may result in subsequent disturbancesand failures like load rejection, power-plant shut-offs, subnetwork disconnectionsor even network break-downs. The author discusses network frequency behaviourin cases of active power disturbances, and nominal voltage behaviourin cases of reactive power disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
