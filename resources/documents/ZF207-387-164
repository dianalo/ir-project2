(IOC), a scanner manufacturer in Clinton, Conn.andM;For example, IOC's Document Processing Software provides a way to &quot;teach&quot; ascanning system to recognize foreign languages and special symbols orcharacters that are degraded or distorted, he said.andM;Scanners are finding a niche in the federal government, according to Dingman.andO;The Department of Defense and other government agencies strongly support thedigitization of paperwork.andP;  Since digitized systems will have to coexist withpaper-oriented systems, scanners will play an important role, she explained.andM;&quot;I think that looking into the future, especially with what the government isrequiring, a lot of people are going to want all their documents in digitalform,&quot; Dingman said.andM;----------Steve Rosenthal is a writer, editor and TV producer in Berkeley, Calif.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
