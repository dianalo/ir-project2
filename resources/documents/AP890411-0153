That warning was issued by President Augusto Pinochet, the armycommander, and the chief of the military academy of strategicstudies.   Pinochet led the coup that ousted the elected government ofMarxist President Salvador Allende in September 1973. In October,voters rejected a military proposal to extend Pinochet's term until1997. An open presidential election now is scheduled for Dec. 14with the winner to take office next March 11.   The 73-year-old Pinochet, speaking Monday night in southernChile, said the armed forces must ``guard the constitutionalorder.''   ``That obliges us to make sure, without hesitation, that thesons of this land will not see the efforts of these yearsdestroyed,'' he said. ``We will continue to work to ensure thatthose seeking political power are authentic democrats, who defendthe model of a free society.''   Army Gen. Alejandro Medina, commander of the military academy,delivered a stronger message Monday to hundreds of non-commissionedofficers.   ``If the institutional order is broken, the armed forces havethe duty to restore it, using ... all the necessary means,'' hesaid.   Medina said civilians must understand ``the role of the armedforces,'' and that role is not one of a policeman watching thecountry ``but to support the reign of law and the institutionalorder.''   Opposition leaders have denounced what the military calls theinstitutional order based on a 1980 constitution approved in areferendum.   Opponents have centered their criticism on two issues: Aconstitutional article that allows Pinochet and the heads of theother military branches to remain as commanders until 1998, and thecreation of a military-dominated National Security Council to``represent'' its views on crucial matters.   No significant progress has been reported in negotiationsbetween the government and opposition on possible constitutionalchanges.   Pinochet authorized the negotiations but said he would not allowchanges in key articles.   The army issued a communique Monday denouncing criticism ofPinochet and saying the army considered such criticism ``asaddressed to each and all members of our institution.''   Genaro Arriagada, vice president of the Christian DemocraticParty, the largest opposition party, responded.   ``Pinochet is a politician and, as such, he is subject tocriticism for his work and his public comments,'' he said. ``Eventhe army's high command is subject to criticism by the citizens.''   He said the continuation of Pinochet as army commander under afuture civilian government ``is tantamount to establishing an armedstate within an unarmed democratic state.''</TEXT></DOC>
