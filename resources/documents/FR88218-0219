Part E of the Act establisheda program of criminal justice discretionary grants for public agenciesand private non-profit organizations. The Act also specifies four purposesfor which discretionary grants can be made: (1) Education and trainingprograms for criminal justice personnel; (2) technical assistance to statesand local governments; (3) national or multi-state projects; and (4) demonstrationprograms.  The FY 1988 appropriations for Part E discretionary programs is $8 million.A portion of these funds was earmarked by the Congress for specific construction.The remaining discretionary funds were programmed with an emphasis on continuationsof BJA programs initiated in Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987, including nationaltechnical assistance and training activities, support for professionalstandards, and completion of demonstration programs. In terms of substantiveareas the emphasis is on crime prevention activities, law enforcement support,improved court management, and support for state prison capacity studies.There was little leeway in the FY 1988 programming for new initiatives.After a 45 day comment period and Bureau consideration of all commentsreceived, a final notice of its priorities will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart I_Construction</ITAG><T3>Background: </T3>The Congressional appropriation earmarked $2,025,000for two construction projects: a Judicial Center in Owensboro, Kentucky;and a Water Treatment System in Alderson, West Virginia, which serves thefederal prison in Alderson.Because of restrictions in the Act concerning construction projects andother legal concerns, BJA must await an opinion from the Controller Generalbefore making awards under this section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart II_Enforcement</ITAG><T3>Program Title: </T3>Deadly Force Training and Technical Assistance.<T3>Purpose: </T3>Since October 1986, the Bureau of Justice Assistancehas sponsored training and technical assistance for police executives inthe development and implementation of deadly force policy. Under a cooperativeagreement with the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP),the project is based on the best available research. Due emphasis is placedon the 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in <T3>Tennessee </T3>v. <T3>Garner </T3>and other recent cases. It has become evident that criticaldeadly force issues remain in state and local jurisdictions. To improvethe implementation of sound deadly force policies, and to reduce frictionand liability for communities, BJA is emphasizing training of supervisorsand field training officers under this grant extension.<T3>Grant Period: </T3>We anticipate a twelve-month extension of the currentcooperative agreement with IACP.<T3>Award Amount: </T3>$250,000 is earmarked for this project.<T3>Project Contact: </T3>The BJA contact is Fred W. Becker at 202/272-4605.<T3>Program Title: </T3>Expert Systems for Residential Burglaries.<T3>Purpose: </T3>This program was announced in the May 6, 1987 <T4>Federal Register</T4>; however the Bureau made the decision not tofund the full program at that time. A ``Phase One'' program was fundedthat was preparatory to the planned demonstration. It included preliminaryscreening for potential demonstration sites. The focus of the program isan artificial intelligence system, based on research conducted in the UnitedKingdom, designed to assist police agencies in the successful investigationof residential burglaries. A more sophisticated version is being developed,utilizing more powerful hardware and software that has just become available.The new advanced version is currently being tested in Baltimore County,Maryland. That system will be operational by February 1988. If it provessuccessful, the Bureau of Justice Assistance will continue with the previouslyannounced plan to establish the system in up to four additional jurisdictions.Successful implementation in the demonstration sites should lead to widespreadutilization of the technology using commonly available micro-computers.<T3>Grant Period: </T3>A minimum of twelve months will be added to thecurrent grant to effect demonstrations.<T3>Eligibility Criteria: </T3>BJA will extend the current project withthe Jefferson Institute for Justice Studies, Washington, DC<T3>Award Amount: </T3>A $350,000 program is contemplated with a combinationof $100,000 Justice Assistance Act and $250,000 Anti-Drug Abuse Act funding.<T3>Project Contact: </T3>The BJA contact is Fred W. Becker at 202/272-4605.<T3>Program Title: </T3>Law Enforcement Technical Assistance and Training.<T3>Purpose: </T3>The Bureau of Justice Assistance intends to extend thecurrent cooperative agreement with the Police Foundation that providestechnical assistance and training to law inforcement agencies. This projectprovides a broad range of assistance to state and local programs includingthose initiated under Justice Assistance Act Block Grant support. Reflectingemphases in the Act, major efforts to date have concentrated on IntegratedCriminal Apprehension Programs (ICAP), STING programs, Arson, OrganizedCrime, and White Collar Crime.<T3>Grant Period: </T3>We will extend the current cooperative agreementfor an additional twelve months.<T3>Award Amount: </T3>$450,000 is earmarked for this project.<T3>Project Contact: </T3>The contact is Fred W. Becker at 202/272-4605.<T3>Program Title: </T3>Commission on Accreditation For Law EnforcementAgencies.<T3>Purpose: </T3>The Bureau of Justice Assistance and its predecessorAgencies in the U.S. Department of Justice have long fostered the conceptof voluntary professional accreditation as one means of ensuring qualitystate and local law enforcement. We have provided financial assistancein support of the concept and its implmentation from the planning phasethrough the present. Today the Commission on Accreditation for Law EnforcementAgencies is a thriving reality, nearing financial independence. There hasbeen a tremendous upsurge in the number of law enforcement agencies thathave entered into the accreditation process. Over 600 agencies are currentlyinvolved. In addition, thousands of other police officials, and officialsof state, county and municipal executive and legislative branches haveexpressed interest. The original 900 plus standards were developed usingthe resources of the four founding national organizations. Revisions tostandards have been accomplished, as needed, by the Commission and staff.However, workload resulting from the aforementioned growth makes it impossiblefor existing staff to develop new accreditation standards required to keepup with research, legal precedents, crime trends, etc. Failure to remedythis situation will result in the erosion of the standards and ultimatelyin the value of the accreditation process. Therefore, the Bureau of JusticeAssistance will make an award to the Commission for reserch and developmentfor priority additions/revisions to the body of standards for accreditation(Standards Manual).<T3>Grant Period: </T3>The nature of the work requires a minimum of 18months.<T3>Award Amount: </T3>$150,000 is earmarked for this project.<T3>Project Contact: </T3>The contact is Fred W.
