Lagerfeld's graceful collection drew inspiration from the MiddleAges as he softened everything from shoulders on down. Hishistorical touches at Friday's show were subtle and looked likeclothes rather than costumes.   From Robin Hood hats and swirling capes to Empire dresses, theelegant clothes were often in grey, black and white.   The pants were very wide or as narrow as tights, worn with whitesweaters, pearl chokers, beaded necklaces and elaboratecummerbunds. Others were topped by bright quilted jackets.   Lagerfeld also showed flaring pyramid coats and full pleatedskirts cut to the knee rather than mid-calf.   To temper the lean sweater-dresses, Lagerfeld exhibited somepuffball coats of Mongolian lamb.   Dinner dresses with clinging tops and flowered silk skirtstopped by tulle were graceful. And the high-waisted Renaissancedresses in black velvet and white silk with their scalloped edgeswere romantic enough for any Juliet.   Lagerfeld black Chantilly sheath enveloped in a cloud of tullemakes an appealing change from bows, bustiers and ruffles seen sooften recently.   Gaultier, once the rogue designer of wild shapes, has toned downto very soft fabrics and wearable silhouettes. The clothes weretopped by knit beanies with pompons for a flippy note.   His long, loose coats with gold buttons and capes came out insober dark tones. But olive, cinnamon, bordeaux and dusty yellowadded a little color.   The only day dresses at Gaultier were pleated long pinafores,for a yuppie who wants to look like a maid.   Chloe's show, with the clothes designed by Martine Sitbon, was amixture of bright plaids and lame-plastered trouser suits.   There were big-collared coats and shawl-wrapped dresses withpleated full skirts in lengths short or hovering around the knee.   Jean-Charles de Castelbajac went to the nursery for inspirationin sporty clothes. He appliqued naive motifs of houses and trees onduffel coats, or had hand-painted animal spots on fluffy longjackets over striped tights.   Primary colors dominated, but he also used ivory and pastels,especially in big mohair coats.   Bernard Perris jazzed up his collection with bright colors in agroup of miniskirts and shorts topped by shawls.   He also showed slim-lined longer brown dresses with berthacollars, fur wraps and muffs.   Paul-Louis Orrier is better-known in America than in France forhis dressy clothes, and his show at the Grand Hotel had plenty ofAmericans in the audience.   His models displayed puffy, draped silks and satins with flowerscascading out of some of the drapes. The short evening wear came inamethyst, bright green and iridescent taffeta.</TEXT></DOC>
