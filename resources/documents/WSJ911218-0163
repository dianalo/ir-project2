Under the agreement, Disney's powerful home-video divisionwill distribute Henson videocassettes for five to six years,which could translate into tens of millions of dollars inrevenue. Neither company would comment on the transaction,but Disney has scheduled a news conference for today.</LP><TEXT>   At first glance, the reunion seems bizarre, because thebreakup of Disney's planned purchase of Henson last year wasso ugly and so public. An angry exchange of lawsuits andpress interviews saw each side accusing the other of greedand bad faith, and the episode quickly turned into apublic-relations fiasco for both companies.   Though some joint projects between the two companiescontinued -- such as the TV show &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; and a Muppets3-D film at Walt Disney World -- many industry executives andanalysts believed it would be impossible for the two toovercome their acrimony.   But individuals close to the companies said LosAngeles-based Henson was upset with some of Disney'scorporate executives, not with its operational people intheme parks, television and home video. &quot;The marriage betweenHenson and Disney made a lot of sense in the first place,&quot;says one executive familiar with the situation. &quot;Thatfundamental fact didn't change when things broke apart.&quot;   Home video was a big reason the two companies wanted toget together initially. As a somewhat sleepy family companybuilt by the gifted puppeteer who founded it, HensonProductions first began seeking a Hollywood home-video dealin 1989, and had been close to signing up with ParamountCommunications Inc. Henson's film and television programminglibrary, with well-loved, recognizable characters such as theMuppets, was underexploited, while the market forvideocassettes geared to children was exploding.   Then, Jim Henson and Disney Chairman Michael Eisner hit itoff personally, and talks began about an outright acquisitionby Disney. Disney agreed to buy the company in 1989 for about$150 million. But final negotiations dragged on for months,and Mr. Henson died unexpectedly, with ownership of hiscompany reverting to his five children.   Talks began to deteriorate, then broke off over tax andcompensation issues. In April, Henson Productions filed alawsuit against Disney, charging it with copyright andtrademark infringement and fraud. Disney countersued, but thesides settled soon after. The agreement gave Disney onlylimited theme-park use of the Henson characters, keeping thevaluable franchise unencumbered in case Henson seeks anotherbuyer.   The video agreement preserves the same independence. Whenthe pact expires, all rights will revert to Henson. AtHenson's request, the videocassettes will be released with aJim Henson logo; the cassette packaging won't bear the Disneyname, mentioning only Disney's Buena Vista distribution unitin small letters, according to people with knowledge of theagreement.   Disney took a similar low-profile approach in its recentsuccessful release of old &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; televisionepisodes from the Jay Ward Productions library, using itsmarketing prowess to score an unexpectedly large home-videohit.   Disney also is expected to bankroll as many as three newHenson productions a year for direct video release, as wellas distribute &quot;Fraggle Rock,&quot; &quot;The Storyteller,&quot; &quot;MuppetBabies,&quot; &quot;The Muppet Show,&quot; &quot;Mother Goose&quot; and other Hensonproductions.   Though Disney isn't the largest video distributor, it isthe leader in videos for children and in the often-relatedbusiness of selling videos directly to consumers rather thanto video stores for the rental market.   &quot;Disney is perfect for Henson,&quot; says a person who knowsboth companies. &quot;This shows the way things might have been.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
