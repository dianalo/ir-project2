But the leader of President Roh Tae-woo's 22-member Cabinetreiterated his government's determination to crush leftist radicalgroups.   ``The government will not sit idle when campuses are becomingfirebomb-manufacturing factories. Neither will we allow them tobecome the bases of violence,'' Kang told the National Assembly.   ``Also, I am willing to resign if held responsible for any stateaffairs that have been mishandled,'' he said.   Opposition members used the session to launch an offensiveagainst Roh's government, demanding Kang and all Cabinet ministersresign for failing to provide effective leadership.   Dissenting legislators charged the government is blockingdemocratic reform and using a crackdown on violent protests tosuppress all its opponents. They accused the government ofprovoking unrest.   The opposition-controlled assembly can pass a resolution callingon the Cabinet to resign, but the administration is not obliged bylaw to honor such a motion. Opposition legislators did not call forRoh's resignation.   Answering their charges, Kang said diss and undermine theSeoul government. The two nations have been bitter rivals since1945.   The government stepped up its crackdown after six riot policemenwere killed in a May 3 clash with radical students in southernPusan city.   Roh warned he would invoke emergency powers to end violentprotests.   Justice Minister Huh Hyung-koo, testifying in parliamentWednesday, said 234 radical students, workers and dissidents havebeen arrested since last month. Police are hunting for 76 moreradicals, he said.   The ruling Democratic Justice Party is trying to ban firebombs,a major radical weapon in anti-government protests, and increaseprison sentences for using them from the existing three years toseven years.   Opposition leaders have agreed in principle to adopt theanti-firebomb bill, but they contend the government also must limitpolice use of tear gas, which they say is excessive and tends toaggravate violence.   Radical students and the anti-government dissident groups havelittle support because of their violent tactics and extremepolitical views. The radicals want a leftist state ruled by workersand farmers.</TEXT></DOC>
