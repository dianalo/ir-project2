A CT scan of the musclesshowed characteristic findings of remarkable hypodensities of the cervicalmultifidus, semispinalis cervicis and capitis, multifidus of the back,erector spinae, long heads of biceps femoris and soleus muscles. Histochemicalstudies of the left rectus femoris muscle revealed increased variationin fiber diameters with type I fiber atrophy, partial necrosis and fattydegeneration, infiltration of phagocytes and no ragged red fiber. Anelectron microscopic examination disclosed increased vacuoles and lipidbodies, dilatation of sarcoplasmic reticula, deformed mitochondria andcytoplasmic bodies associated with derangement of myofibrils. The featureof Z band streaming strongly suggested that the cytoplasmic body originatedfrom Z band degeneration. A review of the histopathological findingsof the past literatures was also made.</TEXT></DOC>
