<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-93-0726 </DOCNO><TEXT>A symposium of eight short but complete papers giving an overview of interventionalradiology is presented. Organized by Dr. William Casarella, this symposiumis certainly the most current review of the subject available. This year'scardiovascular section is again heavily weighted toward interventionalradiology. Abrams and Doubilet's article on the underutilization of angioplastyis important because it describes the cost effectiveness of this method.Most health planners, right or wrong, have complained about overutilizationof diagnostic radiology procedures. In general, the opposite is truefor interventional procedures - they are underutilized. If the authorsdraw the attention of their hospital administrators to these approachesand also produce the data on long-term follow-up for our medical colleagues,interventional radiology may realize its full potential. Articles oncardiac magnetic resonance imaging are beginning to appear and this techniqueseems to have great potential. An important article, which is the firstprospective study comparing lung scintigraphy and pulmonary angiographyin the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism, supports the increased use ofpulmonary angiography. Finally, an article on complications of percutaneousbiliary drainage provokes some discussion of its value for routine preoperativeuse.</TEXT></DOC>
