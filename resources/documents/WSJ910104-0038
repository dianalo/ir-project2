The newspaper article said, and Mr. Brunner confirmed inthe interview, that he advised Philip Morris to buy a packetof Jacobs Suchard shares to facilitate the takeover. Withoutreceiving approval from Philip Morris, Mr. Brunner decided togo ahead with share purchases, he said.   The negotiations had begun in early April. Between April19 and May 3, Mr. Brunner ordered that shares andparticipation certificates in Jacobs Suchard be bought by theRothschild Panamanian company Montevar Corp. for 11.8 millionSwiss francs ($9.3 million), the newspaper said.
