But Col. Hugo Torres, political director of the Sandinista Army,said Wednesday that President Daniel Ortega, due back from Cubatoday, might prolong the truce.   He also said Defense Minister Humberto Ortega, the president'sbrother, would meet with his commanders today, then announce ``thearmy's position on the expiration of the unilateral cease fire.''   A truce that went into effect on March 21 and expired at the endof May was unilaterally extended for 30 days by the leftistSandinista government. Today is the end of the 30 days.   Negotiators for the government and for the rebels, known asContras, have made proposals and counterproposals since talks brokedown June 9. But they have been unable to agree on how to resumenegotiations to end the 6{-year-old war.   Torres said that if there is an offensive, it will be biggerthan the one in March that preceded the first round of peace talks.   Sandinista troops reportedly were positioning artillery atstrategic sites in the provinces of Boaco, Chontales, Rio San Juanand Zelaya Sur.   Meanwhile, Nicaragua's bishops urged the government and rebelsto resume peace talks and not to give in to ``hate or the desirefor vengance.''   The bishops said in a pastoral letter issued Wednesday thattheir ``hearts have resounded with the heartbreaking clamor that isrising from the countryside and in the cities of Nicaragua for ...an end to war and to the violent deaths of the young, the peasants,the Indians.''   They said the Sandinista government was putting war before thewell-being of the people and said many people ``now feel defraudedby their leaders, by corruption and by the bureaucracy.''   The bishops also complained about an ``atheistic'' educationalsystem that ``imposes the ideology of a few,'' the recentlegalization of divorce and the ``promotion'' of abortion.   They said the economy has deteriorated so badly that familiies``feel the effects of hunger'' while the government pours moneyinto defense spending.</TEXT></DOC>
