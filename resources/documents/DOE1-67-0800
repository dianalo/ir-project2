Since thereis no convention, sunlight that reaches its bottom can increase the watertemperature considerably above the ambient temperature. For an insulatedcylindrical tank of 1 m in depth and 1 m in diameter, the long-term stabilityof the salinity gradient and the efficiency for solar energy collectionis investigated without extracting heat. Measurement of the concentrationgradient is continued for seven months for NaCl and three years for CaCl{sub2}. No additional salt is added during the measuring periods. The lowestportion in the pond from the bottom up to a 0.17 m height is assumedto act as a heat storage zone. The concentration in the storage zoneis found to decrease from an initial concentration of 38.3 percent downto 25.9 percent in three years. Measurements show that the final temperaturedepends on the meteorological conditions and the thermal performanceof the pond, but not on the type and concentration of the salt used.The heat collection efficiency is largely dependent on the volumetricheat capacity, namely, the product of the density and specific heat ofthe saline water.
