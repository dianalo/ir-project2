(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Prime Computer Inc.'s former chairman hasdenied he violated insider trading rules by buying nearly $1 millionof Prime stock shortly before a takeover offer for the company wasmade public last fall.   David J. Dunn, who resigned last month, acknowledged in anewspaper interview published Wednesday that the transaction lookedquestionable, but insisted it was proper.   Dunn said he and his Texas-based investment firm, IdantaPartners, bought 64,700 shares for $986,675, or an average of $15.25apiece, on Nov. 7 and 8, a few weeks after Prime rejected aconfidential merger proposal from investor Bennett S. LeBow's MAIBasic Four Inc. of Tustin, Calif.   A week later, when LeBow publicly offered to buy Prime for $970million, the market value of Dunn's and Idanta's shares jumped toabout $18 each, yielding a paper profit of more than $177,000.   Dunn told the Middlesex News of Framingham that he had not takenLeBow's private proposal seriously and was surprised by thesubsequent public offer.   ``Obviously, you don't trade stock based on material informationthat is not public, but we didn't believe it was material. Wethought it was an effort to get (Prime to buy MAI),'' he said.   ``As soon as (LeBow) did make the tender offer, I went to theattorneys and I offered to sell the stock to the company at theprice we paid for it, but they said that would indicate that wethought we had done something wrong.   ``I agree with you that this is unusual, but the facts are aboveboard, nothing has been hidden.''   Prime Computer, based in Natick, makes minicomputers and is thesecond largest maker of computer-aided design and manufacturingequipment, surpassed only by International Business Machines Corp.It has 11,000 employees and earned $19 million on sales of $1.6billion last year.   After LeBow pursued Prime for more than eight months, the companyreached a merger agreement this summer with J.H. Whitney andamp; Co., aNew York venture capital firm, for $20 a share, or more than $1billion.   The Securities and Exchange Commission declined to comment onwhether it has investigated Dunn's stock trading. Massachusettsregulators said the state was not probing the transaction.   Some securities analysts said the trading had raised eyebrows onWall Street.   ``If your question is, do people know about it? Yes. If yourquestion is, does it smell? Yes,'' said John Logan, industry analystfor the Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``But is it insider trading? Well,the Securities and Exchange Commission and the courts would have todecide that.''   Dunn did not return messages left Wednesday at his office in SanDiego. It was not clear whether he and Idanta have sold any of thestock.</TEXT></DOC>
