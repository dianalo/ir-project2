WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chancellor Helmut Kohl on Thursdayfired the defense minister and replaced seven other Cabinetministers in a long-awaited shake-up aimed at boosting hisgovernment's appeal to voters.   The reorganization appeared to be mostly a seat-swappingexercise, with some important posts rotating among Kohl's closestadvisers and others going to political allies to ensure theircontinued support.   Kohl's Christian Democratic Union has suffered badly in recentlocal elections, losing control of both the West Berlin andFrankfurt city governments to a rival coalition of left-leaningSocial Democrats and environmentalist Greens.   Kohl's party has been trailing the Social Democrats since thefirst of the year in nationwide polls.   Kohl said the changes were in preparation for next year'sfederal election campaign and not a direct result of the Frankfurtand West Berlin losses.   ``I had planned this cabinet rebuilding long before that,'' Kohltold a news conference.   Also Thursday, Kohl indicated he planned a sharp change in thenation's immigration policies by making it more difficult forethnic Germans to immigrate to West Germany.   ``We are not of the view that immigrants from every region ofthe world where there are Germans should all be able to come tous,'' he said in an interview aired on ZDF television Thursdaynight.   Kohl has faced increasing criticism over the growing number ofethnic German immigrants who compete with West Germans for scarcehousing and jobs.   More than 200,000 ethnic Germans immigrated to West Germany in1988, most of them from East bloc countries. It has long beenofficial government policy that ethnic Germans have a right toimmigrate to West Germany.   The Cabinet appointments, effective April 21, replace Kohl'schief of staff and the ministers for defense, finance, interior,transport, economic cooperation, construction and information.   He named Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg to head theDefense Ministry. The ministry has been the target of publiccriticism in the past year because of a string of deadly NATO jetcrashes and NATO plans to replace short-range nuclear missiles inWest Germany with rockets of a longer range.   Kohl praised the outgoing defense minister, Rupert Scholz, whohe said was ``confronted with many problems for which he cannot bemade responsible.''   Scholz, a former law professor, was appointed in May and had nomilitary experience. He was often left to publicly defend thegovernment's most controversial policies and absorbed the brunt ofcriticism over NATO war games and noisy low-flying exercises.   Stoltenberg became finance minister in 1982, when Kohl's partyjoined forces with the liberal Free Democrats to wrest theleadership from the Social Democratic Party.   The Social Democrats declared the changes ``Kohl's Last Stand''and ``blatant political tradeoffs.'' The Greens called them``boring and desperate.''   In addition to the change at the Defense Ministry, the mostsignificant appointment was the replacement of Stoltenberg withTheo Waigel, head of the Christian Democrats' Bavarian sisterparty, the Christian Socialist Union.   Some government officials said privately the appointment wasdemanded of Kohl to ensure the Bavarian party's continued loyalty.   The Christian Socialist Union now holds six of the 19 Cabinetposts. The Christian Democrats have nine and the Free Democratsfour.   Finance officials said Waigel planned to repeal or sharply limita new 10 percent withholding tax that took effect this year anddrove some investments out of the country.   In other changes:   _ Friedrich Zimmermann switched from interior minister totransport minister.   _ Chief of Staff Wolfgang Schaeuble was promoted to interiorminister.   _ Rudolf Seiters, head of the Christian Democrats' parliamentarydelegation, was named the new chief of staff.   _ The current transport minister, Juergen Warnke, was appointedto oversee international aid projects as minister for economiccooperation.   _ Hans Klein, the economic cooperation minister, became Kohl'sofficial spokesman and head of the federal Press and InformationOffice.   That post, currently held by Friedhelm Ost, will be elevated toCabinet level. Kohl said Ost resigned, but sources within thefederal government have said he was forced to leave.   _ Construction Minister Oscar Schneider was assigned to overseethe government's controversial national museum projects in Bonn andBerlin.   _ Gerda Hasselfeldt was named construction minister, boostingthe number of women in Kohl's Cabinet to three.</TEXT></DOC>
