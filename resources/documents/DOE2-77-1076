The campaign aimsto bring the environmental hazards from nuclear submarines and navalships carrying nuclear weapons to public attention. Worldwide there are544 nuclear reactor ships or submarines each with the potential to meltdownwith serious environmental consequences. One meltdown is known to haveoccurred. Five reactors have been abandoned on the sea bed. Nuclear poweredsubmarines are based at Rosyth, Faslane, Holy Loch, Plymouth and Portsmouthand routinely come into and out of those harbours. There have also beenaccidents involving nuclear weapons on board submarines, aircraft carriersor destroyers which carry nuclear depth bombs and free fall bombs. TheRoyal Navy's accident emergency plans for nuclear naval bases are inadequate.There is a threat to the environment when the reactors are decommissioned.There are no clear plans as to how to deal with the decommissioning ofthe submarines or ships although the fuel rods have been removed fromthe first British nuclear submarine, Dreadnought.
