Baker III announced today.   This is nearly two months ahead of schedule and improvesprospects for completing an accord within a year, Baker toldreporters traveling with President Bush here.   ``By tabling this proposal, we are taking a step toward endingthe military division of Europe,'' Baker said at a news conference.   Baker praised the Soviets for accepting a U.S. proposal toconduct trial monitoring of nuclear missile systems before signing astrategic weapons treaty.   ``We think it is very good that the Soviets have respondedpositively,'' Baker said.   Despite complaints by American anlysts outside the governmentthat it was a stalling tactic, Baker said trial monitoring ``mightmove arms control forward instead of retarding it.''   The negotiations to cut long-range bombers, missiles andsubmarines are being held in Geneva. The talks to reduce troops andother non-nuclear forces are scheduled to recess on Thursday inVienna.   The next round is scheduled for Sept. 5.   Putting NATO's proposal on the table before the recess gives theSoviets and their allies nearly two months to frame a response.   Baker announced, meanwhile, that NATO would propose a ceiling of5,700 combat aircraft for each alliance and 1,900 combat helicopters.   The decision to make the proposal on Thursday was reached by a apanel of senior NATO officials in Brussels last Friday, a U.S.official said.   Bush first unveiled at the NATO summit in May his blueprint fordeep reductions in conventional arms and troops in Europe by thesuperpowers. It was subsequently endorsed by the full NATO alliance.</TEXT></DOC>
