Names Tilton as President And Chief of Refining-Marketing Unit </HL><AUTHOR> Allanna Sullivan (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WNEWS TX </CO><TEXT>   Texaco Inc. named Glenn F. Tilton as president and chief executive officer of its Texaco Refining andamp; Marketing Inc. unit.    The appointment of Mr. Tilton, 40 years old, marks the first time that a chief executive has been named to that unit. The newly created position is part of Texaco's restructuring efforts in which business units will operate as independent profit centers and executives at the operational level will be given more autonomy.    Previously, Mr. Tilton had been vice president, marketing, for Texaco U.S.A. In his new job, he will continue to oversee U.S. marketing operations and he will take on the additional task of running the company's U.S. refining business.    Refining was formerly the responsibility of Donald Schmude, who is leaving Texaco to become the head of the joint venture company that Texaco agreed to form with Saudi Arabia. Under the accord, Texaco plans to sell a one-half interest in three refineries, as well as thousands of gasoline stations, to Saudi Arabia for $1.2 billion.    Mr. Tilton will oversee Texaco's assets in the proposed venture with Saudi Arabia, because Texaco Refining andamp; Marketing will be the equity owner of Texaco's stake in the new company.    Texaco Chief Executive James W. Kinnear, who says he has been trying to cultivate a new breed of energetic and youthful top executives, earmarked Mr. Tilton for a top management spot in the company last year by promoting him to the top marketing position.    Mr. Tilton springs from the same background as Mr. Kinnear, who spent his early career at Texaco in the marketing sector. The young executive joined the oil company in 1970 as a sales trainee in one of its U.S. marketing operations.    After a series of marketing assignments, he was appointed staff coordinator in the strategic planning department. He was named assistant general sales manager for Texaco Europe in 1983 and general manager in 1984.    Mr. Tilton graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in international relations. </TEXT></DOC>
