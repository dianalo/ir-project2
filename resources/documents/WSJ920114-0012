British Airways, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and NorthwestAirlines are considering forming a holding company orconsortium that would coordinate marketing, scheduling andother operations, people familiar with the talks say. The newcompany would serve Europe, the U.S. and Asia and transportmore passengers than any other Western airline.</LP><TEXT>   It also may never get off the ground. The talks remainpreliminary, and government approval could be denied.(Northwest is 49%-owned by KLM, which disclosed last fall itwas talking with British Air.)   But mere discussion of such a plan underlines the newsense of urgency. As the focus of competition shifts from adomestic to an international dogfight, the giant carriers arescrambling for position, spurred by forecasts that by theyear 2000 global passenger traffic will nearly double.   The global airline industry is at a &quot;crossroads,&quot; UnitedAirlines Chairman Stephen Wolf told travel executives lastyear. Addressing financial planners and analysts, JapanAirlines Chairman Susumu Yamaji says he envisions a &quot;newshape&quot; of the industry. And Abdul Aziz bin Abdul Rahman,Malaysia Airlines' recently retired managing director, thinksthe major airlines are &quot;trying to corner the global market.&quot;   The battle is heating up partly because Europe is about toopen its borders. Asia is also becoming a more importantmarket. And in the U.S., where the battle for domesticsurvival is winding down, the winners are turning theirattention overseas.   Which airlines are most likely to be flying high?   The two best-positioned carriers, AMR Corp.'s AmericanAirlines and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, didn't even flyoverseas only 10 years ago. The two U.S. carriers are thebiggest, toughest competitors of the major Western airlinesand will continue to benefit from their strength in thecritical U.S. market.   &quot;They're not going to dominate all markets, but they're inthe best position to become the Coke and Pepsi of {theworld's} airlines,&quot; says William Kutzke, a former vicepresident of airline planning at Northwest. &quot;I'd be worriedif I was sitting on a major route where American and Unitedhad come in.&quot;   Another U.S. giant is likely to play a more modest role.Delta Air Lines, though bolstered by its recent purchase ofinternational routes from now-defunct Pan American WorldAirways, may be held back by its traditionally slow way ofreacting to competitors' moves and cautious way of expandingoperations. A fourth large American carrier, USAir, hasconfined itself to domestic operations so much that it hardlyranks as an international player.   However, mergers or other maneuvers -- such as thepossible British Airways/KLM/Northwest consortium -- couldquickly change the race. In addition to American and United,more than 20 other major international airlines are at thestarting gate. They range from European giants such asBritish Airways, Lufthansa German Airlines and Air France toAsian lines such as Japan Airlines, All Nippon Airways andSingapore Airlines.   Many international carriers undoubtedly will survive asniche players, much like Dallas-based Southwest Airlines inthe U.S. And some will keep flying strictly because ofgovernment protectionism.   Over time, airline experts say, the factors that willdetermine which lines gain the most will differ little fromthe factors that proved critical following deregulation ofthe U.S. airline market in 1978. The carriers that succeededwere those that began with major advantages.   One such advantage lies in airport gates and landingrights. In part, airline competition resembles the game ofMonopoly, in which control of Park Place and Boardwalk iscritical. It's no coincidence that the U.S. carriers thatemerged on top -- United and American -- are also the twolargest at Chicago's O'Hare International. That airport'ssize and central location gave them a major territorialadvantage. Competitors could benefit for a while fromnear-monopolies in places such as St. Louis, Minneapolis andPittsburgh, but none of those offered O'Hare's strategicadvantages.   Similarly, &quot;those carriers that have the large real estateand focused infrastructure in the financial capitals of theworld are going to be best-positioned,&quot; says Harold Pareti,former president of People Express, a post-deregulation U.S.start-up that died. That means places such as London, Tokyo,New York and Chicago -- major transportation hubs. And that'sa major advantage for British Airways, which has 38% of thetakeoff and landing slots at London's Heathrow Airport, andJapan Airlines, which controls 26% of the slots at Tokyo'sNarita.   On the other hand, flying out of remote places is a huge,and perhaps inescapable, problem for airlines such asAuckland-based Air New Zealand, Melbourne-based Qantas andMontreal-based Air Canada.   International airlines also are racing to develop theso-called hub-and-spoke systems that emerged in the U.S.Point-to-point route structures are vulnerable because theyrely solely on the demand for travel between two cities.Hub-and-spoke systems increase the traffic on individualroutes by mixing together passengers traveling to differentdestinations. That fills planes and increases profits.   Currently, carriers such as Zurich-based Swissair,Singapore Airlines, Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific Airways andKLM of the Netherlands fly proportionately morepoint-to-point service than do their large U.S. rivals andare likely to suffer. In addition, their hub flying comesfrom single hubs in home markets that are small compared withthe U.S. &quot;The global airline battle is going to be driven byhubs and spokes,&quot; says Cyril Murphy, United's vice presidentof international affairs.   Surprisingly, something not expected to make muchdifference is the quality of in-flight service. Even thoughinternational travelers tend to put more emphasis on servicethan domestic ones do, most of the world's major lines canmatch each other in offering amenities in the cabin -- exceptfor Aeroflot. Though almost twice as big as any othercarrier, the Moscow-based airline's reputation for service isdismal.   &quot;The absence of quality service is disastrous, but highquality in and of itself isn't going to produce a successfulairline,&quot; says Jon Ash, a former vice president at TransWorld Airlines.   And two competitive weapons that have been highlyeffective in the U.S. -- frequent-flier programs and controlof computerized reservation systems -- may not be soimportant in the global arena. They are no longer new, andmost major carriers are determined to be competitive withboth.   Far more important is a carrier's ability to respondnimbly to changing market conditions. United and American,fresh from competitive battles in the U.S., are able to reactfaster than their foreign rivals, many of which have longbeen sheltered by their governments. On the eve of Pan Am'sshutdown last month, United's executives quickly readiedrequests for temporary flying rights on Pan Am's LatinAmerican routes. Within a week, United had won permanentroute authority in Pan Am's bankruptcy-court auction.   Conversely, government-owned carriers are likely to suffermore from government interference than they gain from theresulting financial security. British Airways' operationsimproved sharply and Japan Airlines' business expandedsignificantly after the carriers were privatized in 1987. Butcarriers such as Alitalia in Rome and Thai AirwaysInternational in Bangkok remain shackled to government.   &quot;It's not until carriers get out of the protection oftheir governments and into the wet that they will be able tosharpen their commercial acumen,&quot; says Michael Lumb at AlanStratford andamp; Associates, a U.K. aviation-consulting firm.   On the other hand, government help is needed to obtainaccess to the world. International route authority and evenairport gates are often determined by bilateral governmentnegotiations. And airlines need their own governments'permission for international flights. &quot;If you can't get moretraffic rights, you can't grow,&quot; says Henri Wassenbergh, arecently retired KLM senior vice president.   The Japanese and Europeans are adept negotiators, but theAmericans have an advantage because they have more to bargainwith -- access to numerous major U.S. cities, compared withthe handful that most smaller countries can offer. And byeven optimistic estimates, European nations aren't likely tobe negotiating as a bloc until at least the end of thisdecade.   Meanwhile, otherwise-liberal governments have started totry to close their doors. Germany, which has long grantedU.S. airlines virtual &quot;open skies,&quot; is changing its tune nowthat they are flooding in and stealing traffic fromLufthansa, whose access to the U.S. is heavily restricted.France is doing the same.   &quot;Everybody has illusions of grandeur in the airlinebusiness. The Italians and the French and the Portuguese andthe Spanish are still going to want national airlines,&quot; saysStephen Miller, a founder of Dragon Air, a Hong Kong start-upthat's now an affiliate of Cathay Pacific.   Government restrictions, however, won't be able toovercome the major carriers' sheer size. &quot;At the end of theday, it's fleet size that will put carriers in the bigleague,&quot; says Michael Kellaway, an airline consultant inMelbourne.   A British Airways booklet, &quot;Manifesto for Civil Aviationin the 1990s,&quot; depicts the tail of a British Air plane,dwarfed next to gigantic tails of American, United and Deltajets. The point: All three have a fleet more than twice thesize of British Air's current 235 planes. American has thelargest, at 622 -- more than British Airways, Air France andLufthansa combined.   &quot;We are prepared to box,&quot; Air France Chairman BernardAttali recently exclaimed to a group of U.S. aviation leadersin Washington. &quot;But you want us to take on U.S.heavyweights,&quot; and Air France, he said, is a &quot;lightweight.&quot;The two Tokyo-based carriers, Japan Airlines and All NipponAirways, also have small fleets -- fewer than 120 planesapiece.   And the big carriers are likely to get bigger. Currently,United, American and Delta have a total of 582 planes onorder, while the orders of Lufthansa, KLM, British Airwaysand Air France total only 222, and Japan Airlines and AllNippon combined have only 107 orders in place.   Ultimately, airline balance sheets will play a major roleas well. With the global airline market growing rapidly,airlines need huge amounts of capital just to buy enoughplanes to stay in the game.   Already, many airlines can't afford the financing thattheir expansion plans require. That problem is most evidentat carriers wedded to government subsidies. Although AirFrance was recently cleared to receive a government infusionof two billion francs (about $370 million), that will mostlyjust bolster its balance sheet and won't fuel much aggressivegrowth.   David Treitel at Simat, Helliesen andamp; Eichner, an airlineconsulting group based in New York, estimates U.S. airlines'annual financing requirements at $19 billion. Of that hugesum, he says, $10 billion will have to come fromnontraditional sources, such as new equity offerings, assetsales, tax credits and governments.   That partly explains why Northwest Airlines may be eagerto link up with British Airways and KLM. Northwest's parent,Wings Holdings, appears to be among the world's most heavilyleveraged major airline holding companies, with acurrent-assets-to-liabilities ratio of 54.3% as of July 31.Northwest, though, says its debt isn't a problem, partlybecause of assets that are more valuable than book valuesindicate.   The three airlines are considering an organization muchlike Royal Dutch/Shell Group, which has separate British andDutch units under a single holding company, or Unilever, aconsumer-goods company with legally separate British andDutch units. Northwest would be the U.S. division,concentrating on U.S. domestic service and U.S.-Asia flights.KLM and British Airways would be the European division, withmost of the intra-European and trans-Atlantic service,according to people familiar with the plan. Which line, ifany, would become the main Europe-Asia carrier apparentlyremains undecided.   Northwest and Air France are behind their rivals becausetheir jet fleets averaged more than 10 years of age at theend of 1990, according to Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va.,consulting group. By comparison, British Airways' fleetaveraged 9.7 years and JAL's 8.6 years. United's fleetaveraged about 12.3 years, but Julius Maldutis, a SalomonBrothers Inc. analyst, estimates that its aggressivenew-aircraft delivery schedule will bring that down to 8.5years by 1995.   British Airways and Lufthansa, meanwhile, are strugglingto reduce their high operating costs. And Japan Airlines andAll Nippon, with plans for new airport facilities andaircraft, are both facing a lot of capital expenses.Nonetheless, Japan Airlines says new airport facilities andplanes are a &quot;priority.&quot;   Compared with their overseas rivals, American, United andDelta have better cost structures. &quot;They've been through agut wrenching for the last 13 years,&quot; says Rose Anne Tortora,an airline analyst at County NatWest Securities in New York.Based on one productivity analysis, U.S. airlines' costs areat least 20% lower than foreign airlines' costs, partlybecause U.S. employees are more productive.   Thus, unless they run into significant governmentalroadblocks, carriers such as United and American seem mostlikely to become global mega-carriers.
