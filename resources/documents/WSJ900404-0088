Expertsdiffer on how close the Iraqis have come to possessing thebomb. But krytron switches are one of the last items requiredfor fielding an operational nuclear device.   For several years Iraq has boasted of indigenous weaponsprograms and its ability to acquire embargoed Westerntechnology through front companies and technology transferagreements. On Monday, Iraqi's President, Saddam Hussein,bragged in a speech in Baghdad that Iraq now possessed astock of nerve gas -- which it is prepared to use againstIsrael. Until recently, though, Mr. Hussein's claims have notbeen taken seriously.</LP><TEXT>   When Iraq announced in August 1987 that it had launched alocally developed ballistic missile, for instance, there wasrelatively little fuss in the West. It was only when missilescame crashing down on Tehran six months later that the worldwoke up.   To its credit, the U.S. government has been one of the fewattempting to do something about the Iraqi weapons programs.Since 1987, high-ranking U.S. delegations have beendispatched on numerous occasions to Paris, Bonn, Rome andelsewhere, to protest the failure of those allies to blocksensitive technology sales to Iraq. Most of the protests,were delivered in the context of the Missile TechnologyControl Regime, signed by the U.S. and six allied nations inApril 1987. But U.S. protests have achieved little to stemthe tide of Western assistance to Iraq.   In 1984, a group of former Italian intelligence officerswere indicted in Rome for conspiring to supply Iraq with 34kilograms of plutonium -- enough to manufacture as many asthree nuclear devices -- and one ton of yellowcake, oruranium ore. In 1987, the French government tentativelyoffered to rebuild the damaged Osirak nuclear plant nearBaghdad, a plant capable of processing the yellowcake intoweapons-grade fuel.   France's offer was in fact unnecessary. Iraq had alreadybegun a top-secret program to rebuild the Osirak reactorimmediately after the Israeli raid. Detailed interviews inthe Iraqi press earlier this year suggested that new isotopemanufacturing units began production in 1985 and 1988, andthat the reactor is fully functioning today. Last week, theSaudi government acknowledged that it was partially fundingIraqi nuclear research. The Saudis reassuringly insisted,however, that the research is &quot;entirely peaceful&quot; in nature.   U.S. intelligence officials were warning of the resumptionof the Iraqi effort to acquire nuclear weapons technology twoyears ago, and accused China of having supplied a crucialuranium enrichment plant. Some Western companies, attractedby the fabulous bonuses Iraq was offering, also providedhelp.   Instead of purchasing pieces of equipment, Iraq, likeSouth Africa, Pakistan and Israel, has concentrated onbuilding up an indigenous industrial base, safe from futureembargo effects. A sealed indictment presented in San Diegolast week claimed that the krytron puchasing ring reported toa state-owned Iraqi company, controlled by the Ministry ofIndustry and Military Industries (MIMI). This is the sameministry that is responsible for Iraq's ballistic missile,its chemical weapons and its other armaments programs. Run byHussein Kamil Hasan, the nephew of the Iraqi president, andemploying a legion of well-trained armaments engineers, MIMIhas launched a crash effort to acquire the sophisticatedtechnologies and know-how to enable Iraq to become afull-fledged manufacturer of a whole triad of strategicweapons.   Iraq is certainly hoping to cash in on the deterrent valuenuclear and chemical weapons provide. But a powerfulstrategic arsenal confers other benefits as well. In 1973,when Syria and Egypt launched their surprise attack onIsrael, Iraq was forced to sit on the sidelines. The armoreddivision it dispatched by road to Damascus as a gesture ofArab solidarity barely arrived in time for the final days ofthe battle. As a result, Iraq was left out of the negotatingprocess, an omission that left Iraqi leaders bitter anddisappointed.   Mr. Hussein clearly intends to be remembered when it comestime for the next round of negotiations -- or for the nextwar. His strategic arsenal puts Iraq on the front lines withIsrael in a way that was never before possible. It alsoprovides him with leverage to persuade other Arab states toback Iraq's pretension as the new leader of the Arab world,supplanting Saddam Hussein's long-standing rival, SyrianPresident Hafez Assad.   As the post-World War II security arrangement between thesuperpowers breaks up, Iraq is hoping to emerge as thedominant political and military force in this volatileregion. This is not an aim that even the best orchestratedcustoms sting operation can stop.   ---   Mr. Timmerman edits Mednews, a Paris-based newsletterabout Middle East defense issues.</TEXT></DOC>
