Michael Dukakis &quot;has talked more about what he did in Massachusetts than what he would do for the country&quot;; that the Rev. Jesse Jackson's campaign was &quot;more slogans than solutions&quot;; and that Vice President George Bush won votes by &quot;avoiding specifics on almost everything.&quot;    But Ms. Mitchell's perceptive critique on the &quot;Today&quot; show that the 1988 campaign was &quot;all mood music, no lyrics&quot; might just as easily be applied to the medium she serves.    The view of the 1988 presidential campaign from the living room, gleaned from a week of monitoring nearly three dozen morning and evening television news programs on NBC, ABC, CBS and the Cable News Network, consists mostly of parades and rallies. Last week's immersion in televised politics produced a blur of cheering crowds, airport arrivals and speculation about which contender will drop out and which will survive to fight another news cycle. It was a diet of visual Muzak where issues almost never intrude.    Thursday night, for example, CBS News correspondents spent nearly five minutes -- a healthy amount of time on television news shows -- on the presidential contest without any substantial discussion of any campaign issue. The two segments concluded with chief Washington correspondent Bob Schieffer remarking that Mr. Bush's strategists &quot;say the election will not be about specifics.&quot;    The campaign plane and the living room offer two vastly different glimpses of how America chooses its president. During an ordinary campaign day, presidential candidates are pressed by voters, by reporters and by other political figures for their views on a wide range of subjects. But in the slices of the campaign that television viewers saw last Monday to Friday, issues -- when they appeared at all -- almost always were portrayed in tactical terms.    In fact, the only time a campaign issue won any detailed airing on the television networks last week was when it was forced upon them by disclosures that Mr. Jackson had exchanged letters with Panama's Gen. Manuel Noriega.    Political analysts agree that television is the principal influence on the voters who this spring are helping to shape the nation's future. &quot;The only two things that matter -- the only two things -- are network news and paid commercials,&quot; says Robert Shrum, a Democratic media consultant who advised former candidate Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri on his campaign this year. &quot;The network news is the air cover for the candidate invasion,&quot; Mr. Shrum says.    For all its importance -- acknowledged even by newspaper reporters and editors nostalgic for the power they wielded before the Kennedy era and resentful of the influence of their electronic brothers and sisters -- television still hasn't resolved whether its principal purpose is information or entertainment.    But even its greatest detractors agree that television offers its viewers immediacy and intimacy -- and permits them to evaluate what the candidates are like, if not what they are saying or what their plans are.    &quot;You can actually feel Jesse Jackson in your living room,&quot; says Roger Stone, a GOP political strategist who advised the now-disbanded campaign of Rep. Jack Kemp of New York. &quot;And that's good for him, because it keeps people from looking at his record.&quot;    Last week's television was full of Mr. Jackson, as if some mystical force were drawing the black preacher and the camera together.    He dominated news coverage, with much of it showing warm and endearing pictures of Mr. Jackson appealing to just the sort of white voters who rejected him in 1984. In one CBS piece Monday, Mr. Jackson hugged four people, held hands with two young girls and held a child aloft -- all within 2 1/2 minutes.    All the networks, including CNN, stressed the excitement Mr. Jackson generated in Wisconsin, where he was soundly defeated by Mr. Dukakis, the man the networks ridiculed -- that isn't too strong a word -- for his soporific campaign style.    One of the most evocative TV pieces came Tuesday, on the morning of the Wisconsin primary, when Betsy Aaron of CBS opened her report on the Democratic front-runners by saying that &quot;in the polls they are close, but in the excitement scale they are poles apart.&quot; Mr. Jackson's gestures and enthusiastic crowds offered a stark contrast to Mr. Dukakis's delivery of a deliberate case for his candidacy. The emphasis was on &quot;the feel-good factor, the effect Jesse Jackson is having on his supporters.&quot;    The day after Mr. Dukakis prevailed in Wisconsin, Bob Faw of CBS returned to the governor's &quot;passion gap,&quot; argued that &quot;the failure to inspire can be costly&quot; and added, &quot;Others say the absence of passion says a lot about Dukakis's character: that he doesn't set people on fire because he doesn't feel anything deeply himself.&quot;    Time and again, television focused on what Gene Randall of CNN called the candidates' &quot;contrasts in style,&quot; portraying the Wisconsin primary in simple, even simplistic, terms: a struggle between charisma and competence. But even after the candidate who stressed competence won a decisive victory, there was little examination of the record of the candidate who, it was implied, offered only charisma.    The next morning, in a live interview with Mr. Jackson on ABC's &quot;Good Morning America&quot; show, host Charles Gibson let the candidate glide over what Mr. Jackson called &quot;numbers for a budget projection on the cost of making us better&quot; without seeking any details on the matter -- one of the main issues facing Mr. Jackson.    That evening, NBC's Chris Wallace said Mr. Jackson &quot;discussed his economic platform with new detail, something more like an accountant than a charismatic preacher,&quot; but he offered viewers few hints of those details beyond Mr. Jackson's willingness, already widely known, to raise tax rates on upper-income taxpayers. For that answer, viewers had to tune in to CNN's Linda Taira, who provided details on Mr. Jackson's programs Friday.    Throughout the week, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee was treated as something of an afterthought, often used as a counterpoint to Mr. Jackson, but even then with little exploration of his views. Jerry King's spot on Mr. Gore on ABC Tuesday morning dealt primarily with what political commentators call the &quot;horse-race&quot; aspect, offering this verdict: &quot;In the Gore camp, victories -- winning large numbers of delegates -- always seem to be in the future.&quot;    And the Republicans? With their race all but over, it's hardly surprising that they're barely evident on television these days. But NBC's Lisa Myers was able to win air time for a story about how Pat Robertson used the tax-exempt Freedom Council to finance his campaign.    CNN's &quot;Inside Politics,&quot; a lively new entrant with good reporting and analysis, offered a welcome look at the Robertson campaign, with the former Christian broadcaster saying what he wouldn't say when the other networks were watching: that he believes his campaign, now all but closed down, is on God's mission.    But the best insight into how television views this year's election came not in a political piece but in a report on that other American ritual, baseball's Opening Day. The start of the baseball season, correspondent Dick Schaap said on ABC's &quot;World News Tonight,&quot; is one of the nation's best-loved institutions. It is, he said, &quot;what every presidential candidate wishes he were: familiar, comfortable, reassuring, a reason for hope and celebration.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
