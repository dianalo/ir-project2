He still has a handwritten note from broker John Wellman, ballyhooing how &quot;our Asset Allocation Fund has averaged 20.3% per year.&quot; But in the past 18 months, the diversified fund has edged up only 4%, the helpful broker has departed, and his replacement, Mr. Grant says, seems to be ducking his phone calls.    PaineWebber &quot;has clammed up like I'm looking for cruise-missile information,&quot; complains the executive of a St. Louis medical-equipment company.    &quot;That's an exaggeration,&quot; replies the new broker, Marvin Peterson, who nonetheless won't go into details.    For many investors, their lengthy love affair with mutual funds and other managed funds is over. Financial-services industry layoffs and branch closings are ushering in an era of stingy service -- and of potholes for investors already rattled by the stock-market crash last Oct. 19. Increasingly, fund holders say, they must struggle to get service and information, especially when dealing with firms that market their mutual funds directly.    In the case of mutual funds sold through brokers -- and that's nearly three-quarters of the assets in stock and bond funds -- many investors complain not only about sagging service but also about high-pressure sales tactics by brokers desperate to bolster depleted paychecks.    And while laying off personnel who service mutual-fund accounts, some brokerage firms, anxious to keep up their volume of business, are trying to avoid slashing sales staffs. Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., which is the nation's second-largest vendor of mutual funds, with $71.2 billion under management, says it has reduced its sales force by only 4% this year and its service people much more, by 11%.    Such maneuvers are further tarnishing the outlook for what was America's fastest-growing investment sector. Since 1975, mutual-fund assets have surged seventeenfold to nearly $800 billion, and currently 25% of U.S. households own funds. Now, however, the little guy can't seem to forget the crash, when people couldn't get through on the telephone to redeem their shares.    &quot;There's a whole generation of people who will never own funds again,&quot; says Michael Stolper, a San Diego investment adviser.    Sales of stock mutual funds have plunged to three-year lows, and no rebound is in sight. Many investors have fled to money-market and bond funds, which account for three-quarters of industry assets, up from one-third in August 1982, when the big bull market began. Total mutual-fund assets have edged up 3% since year end but remain 6% below their August 1987 peak.    Brokers increasingly are pushing &quot;closed-end&quot; funds, which sell briskly but often slump quickly in value. Unlike the nation's 2,600 mutual funds -- which issue shares on demand -- closed-end funds shut the gate to new investors by issuing a fixed number of shares in the market. Brokers love to sell new closed-end issues because they generate fat commissions. But once the brokers take their cut, the sum to be invested is reduced, and the new shares tend to drop as they hit the market.    Investors complain of strong-arm sales tactics. Richard Gracer, a San Francisco physician, says he told his Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. broker a few months ago that he wanted to sell his bond-fund shares because he feared price erosion from higher interest rates. Just two weeks later, he says, the broker, Clifford Citrano, called and urged him to buy the Prudential-Bache Intermediate Income closed-end bond fund.    Dr. Gracer protested: Why buy into a new bond fund when he was worried about rising interest rates? Besides, he noted, many new closed-end funds quickly fall in value. &quot;Not this one,&quot; he says Mr. Citrano insisted. &quot;So, can I take $10,000 for it&quot; (out of the doctor's account)?    Dr. Gracer, frustrated, hung up. He later took his money out of funds. &quot;I couldn't believe it,&quot; he says of his broker's actions. &quot;I'm sure the internal pressure in the office to sell that fund that day did it; a year ago, he never would have asked me for it.&quot; (Dr. Gracer made a wise decision: The intermediate fund has fallen 8.75%.)    Mr. Citrano, who says he doesn't remember the conversation, says he is &quot;flabbergasted that Richard would have any kind of memory of my saying that; he probably keeps notes on what his wife says.&quot; Mr. Citrano says investors are unfairly heaping abuse on brokers. &quot;Back in July of last year, everyone wanted you to meet their daughter,&quot; he says. &quot;Now, we're the scum of the earth.&quot;    Many investors are being pursued by brokers selling mutual funds. Alvin Hess, a retired kitchen-equipment executive in Hollywood, Fla., says that last year he never got &quot;cold calls&quot; from brokers. Now, he says, he is continually hounded at dinner time by smooth-talking salespeople, especially from Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He says the brokers, who are particularly promoting closed-end funds, often sidestep his questions about the fund manager's track record and holdings and simply push the high yield the fund supposedly should generate.    &quot;I resent it bitterly,&quot; says Mr. Hess, an active investor who says he quickly shoos brokers off the phone. &quot;It's an intrusion.&quot;    Merrill Lynch and Shearson Lehman officials say the sheer size of their sales forces translates into more calls from their firms than others. Merrill adds that most complaints involve new brokers. &quot;They come into an office, hit the books and lists -- and sometimes make an ass of themselves,&quot; a spokesman says.    Layoffs have increased mutual funds' service problems. Fidelity Investments, the industry giant, with $75 billion under management, has laid off a quarter of its 5,710-member staff since February; many of those idled were in phone-service jobs. Other firms, including Kemper Financial Services Inc., Calvert Group, Colonial Group Inc. and Ivy Financial Services Inc., have reduced work forces, too.    &quot;The industry is still way overstaffed,&quot; says Eric Kobren, who publishes an independent newsletter about Fidelity. After the crash, he says, many fund companies hoped that business would bounce back, and &quot;now, they're realizing it isn't.&quot;    However, continuing cutbacks in personnel could further irritate some already-frustrated investors. Mario Maltese, a Fidelity fund shareholder and the chairman of an audio-visual-systems company in Mineola, N.Y., says clogged lines recently caused him to quit seeking help from Fidelity's phone representatives during the day. &quot;I call them in the middle of the night,&quot; he says.    In Princeton, N.J., 62-year-old Jean Brown is worried because Fidelity closed a branch office last month. &quot;If there's another crash and I can't get through on the phone,&quot; she asks, &quot;how will I authorize them to move my money quickly, now that I can't just go down to the office?&quot;    Gerald Quimby, a federal government executive in New York, says workers at Fidelity's Broadway investor center used to answer all his questions; now, they are &quot;less helpful&quot; and often suggest that he phone Fidelity for more information.    Fidelity contends that its service has improved because slower sales have eased the workload and only the best employees have been retained. It also says that it now answers phone calls in an average of just seven seconds, down from 11 seconds before the crash, and that it has increased the number of calls its phone system can handle at one time. In addition, it says, it is prepared, in case of another panic, to quickly use staffers from other parts of the company. On the day after the crash, by contrast, &quot;we literally were trying to train people on the spot,&quot; says Nita Kincaid, the president of Fidelity's Investor Information Services unit.    Some fund groups resort to zany tactics; one tries to improve service with popcorn and petroleum jelly. Scudder, Stevens andamp; Clark holds service seminars at which brokers of its American Association of Retired Persons funds put unpopped popcorn in their shoes. The big idea: Brokers learn how old people who have trouble walking feel. Phone reps also wear glasses smeared with petroleum jelly to simulate cataracts.    Some direct-market mutual-fund groups are trying telephone marketing for the first time. This year, T. Rowe Price Associates Inc. started calling investors who requested information in response to an ad. Steven Norwitz, a vice president, says the Baltimore firm is &quot;encouraged&quot; by results of its new soft-sell approach. &quot;We're trying to be a little more outgoing in keeping in touch with investors,&quot; he adds.    Such tactics aren't luring many investors back into stock funds. In San Francisco, Dr. Gracer says he hasn't returned to long-term funds and will stick with money-market funds for a while. John Ackerman, a superviser at a St. Louis utility, has done the same. &quot;When you can make 7% to 8% in secure stuff,&quot; he says, &quot;why take the risk?&quot;    Mr. Grant, the medical-equipment executive, says he has learned a lesson: &quot;If I had gone the CD route, I'd have been way better off.&quot; (Over the past five years, however, many mutual funds have far outperformed certificates of deposits.) Bank CDs on June 30 totaled $973.3 billion, up 13% from a year earlier.    Some shareholders are riled about what their funds don't tell them. Paul King, a retired Meadville, Pa., store manager, bought into Dreyfus Corp.'s Strategic Investing Fund early last year mainly because of the trading skill of fund manager Stanley Druckenmiller. When the fund's value recently started dropping, he grew worried -- and later read in a magazine that Mr. Druckenmiller had left Dreyfus.    Before the crash, it didn't matter as much who the fund manager was, fund consultants say; now, it's far more important. Dreyfus officials contend that Mr. Druckenmiller will continue to act as a consultant to the fund and that other members of its research team remain. They say they don't consider the change &quot;traumatic.&quot; But Mr. King is furious that he wasn't told.    &quot;It's like betting on a football team and the quarterback isn't in there,&quot; Mr. King says. &quot;Knowing that would make you think twice about betting on them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
