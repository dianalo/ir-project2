The review covered two producers and/or exporters of thismerchandise to the United States and the period September 1, 1986 throughAugust 31, 1987. That notice incorrectly gave 1.31 percent as the marginfor Allatt Paving Equipment Division of Ingersoll-Rand Canada Inc. (formerlyFortress Allatt Ltd.)

After publication of our finalresults we received comments from the petitioner alleging certain errors.In calculating the margin for Fortress Allatt we made the following errors.In calculating the appropriate tax to add to U.S. price, we failed to deductbrokerage expense from the gross U.S. price. In calculating the U.S. priceon sales from the Georgia warehouse, we failed to deduct ``other freight''.Finally, we misapplied the duty rate for certain chain and sprocket parts.Since General failed to respond, its rate was based on Fortress Allatt'srate and has been changed accordingly.<ITAG tagnum="84">Amended Final Results of the Review </ITAG>The Department has corrected the errors and amended the final results.The amended weighted-average margin for Fortress Allatt and for GeneralContruction is 1.39. The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess antidumpingduties on all appropriate entries. Individual differences between UnitedStates price and foreign market value may vary from the percentages statedabove. The Department will issue appraisement instructions directly tothe Customs Service. Further, as provided for by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, a cashdeposit of estimated antidumping duties based on the above margins shallbe required for these firms. For any future entries of this merchandise from a new exporter not coveredin this or prior administrative reviews, whose first shipments occurredafter August 31, 1987 and who is unrelated to any reviewed firm a cashdeposit of 1.39 percent shall be required. These deposit requirements areeffective for all shipments of Canadian replacement parts for self-propelledpaving equipment entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this amendment to the final resultsof review.
