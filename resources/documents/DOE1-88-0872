The analyses in this study were performed at thepreliminary engineering level, prior to undertaking a detailed engineeringand economic analysis, to arrive at closer estimates of the feasibilityand economic viability of the selected systems. A more detailed analysiswould require consideration of the thermal and electrical load coincidencesas well as the rate structure of the particular utility serving the site.</TEXT></DOC>
