The standard ionisation enthalpiesand entropies for (p-CH/sub 3/-C/sub 6/H/sub 4/)/sub 2/CHCl and (p-PhO-C/sub6/H/sub 4/)(Ph)CHCl, calculated from the K/sub I/ at different temperaturesare negative. The dissociation constants K/sub D/ [(1.9-2.9).10/sup -4/mol/L at -70/sup 0/C] do not show a systematic dependence on the electrondonating abilities of the substituents in the aryl groups. Small differencesbetween the UV-vis absorption spectra of unpaired and paired ions wereused to confirm the conductimetrically determined values of K/sub D/.</TEXT></DOC>
