A doctor and a pharmacist contacted by telephone in Male, thecapital, said Maldives television reported the Indians were tryingto negotiate on the high seas for the hostages' release.   The mercenaries, thought to be Tamils from nearby Sri Lanka, fledearly Friday after Indian paratroopers landed to help PresidentMaumoon Abdul Gayoom and his lightly armed security forces.   About 20 hostages, including a Cabinet minister and his family,were hustled aboard the 5,000-ton boat when gunmen fled throughblasts of Indian machine-gun fire, said a senior Indian air forceofficer.   The officer, who spoke on condition of anonymity after returningfrom Male, said an unknown number of mercenaries and theirsympathizers also were on the boat.   In Singapore, former President Ibrahim Nasir of the Maldivesstrongly denied any involvement in the coup attempt and threatenedto take legal action against anyone who implicated him directly orindirectly, the Straits Times reported Saturday. Several Westerndiplomats in Colombo said earlier they suspected Nasir, Gayoom'spredecessor, of involvement.   The attempted coup began shortly before dawn Thursday when gunmenattacked the presidential palace in Male. Gayoom appealed to India,the biggest military power in the region, for help.   India's state-run television Friday showed bullet-pockedgovernment buildings in Male, including the headquarters of the1,200-man Maldivian security forces.   Gayoom was shown smiling and looking fit. He said he requestedIndia military assistance ``in order to minimize casualties amongthe civilians.''   Ahmed Abdullah Aziz, Maldivian high commissioner in Colombo, said12 people were killed during the attack. But Baldev Kapoor, aphotographer for the Sygma agency, quoted Foreign Minister FathullaJameel as saying 30 people died.   Kapoor was one of several Indian journalists taken with Indiantroops to Male. He quoted Kapoor as saying the deaths includedcivilians.   The foreign minister said Indian and Maldivian troops conductedhouse-to-house searches and combed dozens of atolls in Indian Oceannation of coral islands and islets.   Radio Male said five mercenaries were arrested.   Several foreign diplomats in Sri Lanka, about 500 miles northeastof the Maldives, said the invaders numbered no more than 150.   Radio Male said about 700 Indian paratroopers were sent in.Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi did not say how many there were,but he said they would be withdrawn soon.   The identity of the abducted Cabinet minister was not known.   The Indian air force officer said he did not know the man's name.   Several Male residents said Transport Minister Ahmed Mujithabawas abducted.   The Kuwaiti news agency KUNA quoted Sheik Mohammed Rashid, anadviser to Gayoom, as identifying the abducted official asCommunications Minister Mujtabi Hussein.   Gayoom, who has survived three coup attempts since he was electedpresident in 1978, said an investigation was under way to determinewho was behind the latest attack.   In Sri Lanka, a spokesman for the biggest Tamil militant group,the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, denied involvement. Tamils, aminority in Sri Lanka, have been waging a war there for anindependent nation.   The Straits Times quoted Nasir as saying in a statement throughhis lawyer, ``I categorically deny and reject any suggestion that Iwas at any time or in any way involved in the reported coupattempt.''   Nasir and his family have lived in Singapore since December 1978.He was quoted as saying he no longer retained any interest in theMaldives, nor did he have any dealings with any party in Sri Lanka.   Most of the gunmen who landed in Male spoke Tamil, according toresidents and officials.   The Maldives, with a population of 182,000, were ruled by ahereditary sultan until 1968. The proclamation that declared arepublic in 1968 also proclaimed Nasir president.   He became increasingly authoritarian, and in 1975 he fired hisprime minister, who was placed in detention with 25 associates.   Under Gayoom, the Maldives have sought a course of non-alignment.When he was transport minister under Nasir, Gayoom led opposition toSoviet attempts to lease a former British military base in theMaldives.</TEXT></DOC>
