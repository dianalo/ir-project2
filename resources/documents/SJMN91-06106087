In all, some 600,000 Japanese prisoners of war were held in Siberiancamps.;    With the Soviet economy in tatters and Japan holding the key tobillions in development loans, investment and trade, Gorbachev will have takenan important step closer to the help he desperately needs, even if he doeslittle more than improve the atmosphere between the two countries.;   Although the government of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, with whom Gorbachevis to hold three or four rounds of meetings, has placed the return of fourtiny islands off the Siberian coast at the heart of the agenda, Japaneseofficials have steeled themselves for something short of that.;    At least 14agreements;  To put the best possible face on the outcome of the summit, evenif Gorbachev fails to promise the return of the islands, officials from bothsides have worked out at least 14 agreements to be signed during the four-dayvisit.;    Japanese sources say that the government will release $100 millionin emergency food aid to the shortage-plagued Soviet Union. These funds havebeen blocked since the advent of government repression in theindependence-minded Baltic republics.;    In addition, Japan is to providetechnical assistance aimed at helping the Soviet economy make the great leapto an open market.;    A variety of other accords will cover trade, improvedairline connections and overflights, cultural and scientific exchanges.;   Care for Chernobyl victims;  One of the most significant agreements is tocover technical cooperation in the development and control of advanced nuclearpower stations.
