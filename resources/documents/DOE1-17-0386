<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-0386 </DOCNO><TEXT>Deuterium isotope effects on the {sup 13}C NMR chemical shifts have beendetermined for the 2-methyl-2-bicyclo[2.2.2]octyl and 2-methyl-2-bicyclo[2.2.1]heptylcations. These tertiary carbocations have isotope shifts that are largerthan 1 ppm per deuterium, which is an order of magnitude larger thanordinary intrinsic shifts found in nonionic model compounds and in othercarbocations. For deuteriation at the C{sub 3} methylene or methyl group,the same pattern occurs in both cations: isotope shifts that are largeand upfield at C{sub 2}, downfield at C{sub 1}, and upfield at the remainingcarbon directly bonded to C{sub 2}. The similarity in the pattern ofthe isotope shifts suggests that the force field and shielding influencesin both ions are similar. The specific results are interpreted as indicatingthe presence of a shallow potential surface for the bending motion alongthe direction associated with {sigma}-bridging. Since the existence ofthe shallow potential does not depend on the actual extent of bridging,the magnitude of the isotope effect is not proportional to the extentof bridging.</TEXT></DOC>
