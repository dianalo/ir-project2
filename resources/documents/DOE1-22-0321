Nine patients developed a migrainousattack with focal neurological symptoms and headache after the angiographyand during the subsequent, ongoing regional cerebral blood flow rCBFstudy. rCBF was measured by bolus injection of Xenon/sup 133/ into theinternal carotid artery and a gamma camera with 254 collimated scintillationdetectors covering the lateral aspect of the hemisphere. This techniquedepicts rCBF mainly at the level of the superficial cortex, with no depthresolution. The resolution is 1 cm/sup 2/ providing detailed spatialinformation of the cortical blood flow. Other methods for measuring localblood flow in animal and man employ a radioactive, freely diffusibletracer, in combination with an autoradiographic technique for the assessmentof the tissue concentration, the so-called autoradiographic methods.In the series of patients with spontaneous migraine, rCBF was estimatedusing an in-vivo application of the autoradiographic principle. Xenon/sup133/ was administered by inhalation and the time course of the arterialconcentration curve was assessed by a scintillation detector over theupper right lung, since the arterial curve has been found to follow theshape of the lung curve. The rCBF was studied accompanying cortical spreadingdepression in rat experiments to evaluate wheter this phenomenon couldexplain the blood flow changes in migraine. (/sup 14/C) iodoantipyrinewas given as an intravenous bolus injection and the brain content ofindicator was determined by tissue sample or autoradiography after 10or 20 seconds of isotope circulation. The conditions of the autoradiographicmethods are that the flow remains constant within the period of measuring,and that the region under study is homogenous with regard to flow and{lambda}.
