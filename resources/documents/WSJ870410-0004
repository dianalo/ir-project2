Different as all these moves may seem, they are responses to a single development: the purge of middle-management ranks that has swept thousands of people out of the corporate world.    Layers of management have disappeared, and a generation of employees has retired early. As a result, many employers have found that their traditional pay policies reward the wrong people or encourage the wrong business strategies. Thus, new salary structures are being used to reassure remaining managers and to keep valuable ones from fleeing.    But with fewer people on staff, companies are also using pay to try to squeeze the most out of their managers. &quot;In order to get the job done with a leaner staff, it's imperative that each person perform to full potential,&quot; says Craig Hausman, executive director for personnel and organization at Ford. &quot;If you're fat and dumb and happy, if someone isn't doing as much as they should, maybe you ignore it. As you slim down, you can't afford to.&quot;    Pay structures that reward middle managers for increasing the size of their staffs have become frequent targets of change. Many conventional pay plans have awarded &quot;points&quot; for various aspects of a job, one of them being the number of people that the job-holder supervises; the more points, the more pay.    But some critics now say that staff cuts, restructuring and renewed emphasis on productivity have made the idea of awarding points for staff size obsolete. &quot;People spent their time figuring out how they could take over somebody else's department,&quot; says Jude Rich, president of Sibson andamp; Co., compensation consultants.    To change such thinking, Ford has recently begun circulating new salary guidelines. &quot;We won't even look at staff&quot; in considering salaries, says Mr. Hausman. The auto maker has also done away with cost-of-living and general salary increases in favor of merit raises to promote productivity.    Other pay practices are changing to accommodate the demands of the much-different organizations that remain after corporations pare down.    Chevron, where 4,500 employees were dismissed or took early retirement last year, lost many employees who had been hired just after World War II. Its employees' average age dropped to &quot;the low 30s&quot; from about 38 years, says Alex Ross, manager of benefits.    Chevron changed its benefits in several ways. It lowered to 2% from an average of 3% to 5% the amount of pay an employee must contribute to earn matching company contributions in a savings plan. The theory was that younger employees can't save as much. The company also increased the amount an employee can contribute to a tax-favored Section 401 (k) plan to reflect &quot;the needs of younger people without equity,&quot; Mr. Ross says.    Many companies have found it necessary to reassure managers left shellshocked by the news of widespread cutbacks. One method: &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;tin&quot; parachutes for middle- and lower-level employees. Because corporate takeovers often result in payroll-cutting, Herman Miller, an office-equipment maker in Zeeland, Mich., has promised almost all its employees severance pay in case of a hostile takeover. Employees with one to five years of service would get a year's salary in severance pay; those with more than five years of service would get 2 1/2 years of salary.    &quot;We'll see more of these plans in 1987,&quot; predicts David Swinford, a vice president at Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby, a compensation consulting company. &quot;The tin parachute is an idea whose time has come.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
