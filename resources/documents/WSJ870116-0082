Mr. Bradbury, 37 years old, succeeds William L. Cravens, who resigned for personal reasons as chief executive and chairman, reducing the board to 17.    Worthen, Arkansas's largest bank holding company, said Mr. Cravens, 52, suffered a mild heart attack Nov. 24, and would continue as a private consultant to Worthen. Worthen said it has yet to fill the chairman's post. Mr. Bradbury had also been Worthen's chief operating officer, but Worthen said it would leave that post vacant.    As previously reported, an examination by state and federal regulators forced Worthen in November to write off additional bad loans and boost its loan-loss provision. Because of the actions, Worthen reported a revised third-quarter loss of about $3 million instead of the $116,500 profit, or one cent a share, it had earlier reported. </TEXT></DOC>
