such an offerwould be far more politically attractive to a government that is decidedlyunderwhelmed by GEC's defence performance over the past few years, but theteam would have to convince GEC holders that they could drive the assetsharder than present management; discussion of consortia - p3.andM;-  o  -andM;They now have rather more pressing matters to worry about, but itandM;makes one wonder just how much they really know about Plessey Co's business:according to the Financial Times, GEC Siemens Plc's first response to theformal Plessey defence against its bid was to accuse Plessey of failing toaddress adequately how the removal of trade barriers within the EuropeanCommunity and other international developments were changing its markets -but off the top of the head, joint development with Siemens and others ofISDN chips, the parts it is making for San Francisco- based ATE Corp for usein wristwatch pagers to be assembled into products and marketed by a Japanesecompany, the Plessey-Telenet packet switching systems joint venture coupledwith Hoskyns Plc's systems integration and management skills, Plessey'ssubstantial defence interests in Italy as well as the US, the fact that ithas been manufacturing key chips for Nixdorf Computer AG, and the agreementsbetween the Orbitel Communications Ltd joint venture with Racal ElectronicsPlc and Matra Communications SA on manufacture of digital cellular and CTcordless phone equipment, seems a reasonable start - and the list is a longway from being an exhaustive one; moreover GEC Plessey Telecommunications isa substantially more attractive joint venture property to a continental orJapanese public telephone equipment manufacturer by virture of its ownershipof Stromberg Carlson in the US - and that was a Plessey initiative, not a GECone.andM;-  o  -andM;Micron Technology Inc, Boise, Idaho warns customers that itandM;believes counterfeits of its 256K-bit memory chips are being offered for salein Singapore and Bangkok under the Micron name: it discovered that a reported17m 256Ks offered as Micron parts were misrepresented, and says that salesdocuments were forged with improper signatures and listed non-existent partnumbers.andM;-  o  -andM;According to analysts at the Telecommunications Research Centre,andM;UK Telecommunications investment will be considerably lower than that of itsEuropean competitors in 1989/1990;
