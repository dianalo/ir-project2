Agovernment spokesman also acknowledged for the first time there wasa split among Communist Party officials over how to deal with thepopular uprising.   Also on Friday, nearly 100 more people were arrested nationwidefor taking part in the protests _ including a fourth person named ona wanted list of 21 student leaders _ and the government ordered twomore Western reporters to leave the country.   An army spokesman, Gen. Li Zhiyun, said for the first time thatsoldiers fired into Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4, butlater contradicted himself.   ``Some of the soldiers ... directed their fire into the square,''Li told selected Western reporters during a news conference at theGreat Hall of the People.   At another point, however, Li said of the deaths: ``It is notfrom any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at thepeople. This incident never happened within the area of Beijing.''   Reporters who were not allowed to attend the news conferenceobtained the comments by watching a CBS News videotape. Li spokethrough an official translator and did not clarify the remarks.   Before the news conference, the military took selected Westernreporters on their first tour of the square since the fighting.   The government campaign appeared aimed at demonstrating thatprotesters were not shot while they were inside the 100-acre square,the symbolic center of power in China.   Although Tiananmen Square was the focus of the demonstrations,reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on ChanganAvenue, the main road to the square. But there were conflictingreports during the confused fighting in the darkness and somestudents reported shooting inside the square.   Other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of thesquare and at the bridge at Muxudi, the western gateway to the innercity. Reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up byprotesters in Tiananmen Square.   The heaviest fighting occurred on the road to the square and thegovernment has previously acknowledged that some soldiers shotcivilians to death while pushing their way toward Tiananmen. Butofficials have insisted that no shots were fired when troops enteredthe square with tanks, and that no one died there.   The government says the fighting killed nearly 100 soldiers andpolice, and about 100 civilians. Chinese witnesses and Westernintelligence estimate the death toll may have been as high as 3,000.   China's evening TV news showed crews disinfecting the square,repairing the pavement and replanting bushes. It did not say when itwould be reopened.   Soldiers held solemn memorials for troops killed in the fighting.Shrines were set up on the streets where several soldiers died, andTV showed residents bowing in front of pictures of the dead.   Government spokesman Yuan Mu, asked in an interview with NBC Newsabout the fate of Communist Party General Secretary Zhao Ziyang,said: ``It is true that certain individuals in the top Chineseleadership are guilty of supporting the counterrevolutionary _ ofsupporting turmoil.''   ``But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be madepublic,'' he said. He did not mention Zhao by name.   The party chief has not been seen in public since May 19, when hevisited student protesters occupying Tiananmen Square and tearfullyappealed to them to go home. He said with apparent sympathy that theproblems they had raised, including official corruption, would beresolved with time.   Premier Li Peng declared martial law in Beijing the next day.   Sources later said senior leader Deng Xiaoping, joined by agingconservatives, stripped Zhao of his power, but that he had yet to beformally removed from office.   Yuan skirted a question on whether China might invade the U.S.Embassy in Beijing to arrest dissidents Fang Lizhi and his wife, LiShuxian, who took refuge there after the army marched into Tiananmen.   ``He must be brought to justice. We will deal with him accordingto legal procedures,'' Yuan said. The translator stumbled on thereply, saying Fang had been served ``a death _ an arrest warrant.''   The official media continued its attacks on the protesters and onFang, who is accused of plotting to overthrow the party; he did notparticipate in the demonstrations.   Hardliners called on the nation to study the ``penetratinganalysis'' of Deng on the true goals of the seven-week, student-ledmovement for a freer society.   The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said: ``This is the mostpowerful ideological weapon for lancing every kind of ideologicalpimple.''   It described the students and their supporters as ``a gang ofpolitical hoodlums, the evil remnants of the Gang of Four and otherdregs of society.'' The Gang of Four were the radical leaders of the1966-76 violent far-left Cultural Revolution.   The number of arrests reported since the crackdown began climbedpast 1,185. Among arrests announced Friday was Ma Shaofeng, a24-year-old student from the Beijing Film Academy who was a leaderin the independent student union that organized the protests.   A radio report said Ma surrendered in southeastern China'sGuangdong province. That left at large 17 of the 21 student leadersnamed on a wanted circular distributed Tuesday.   The government gave two journalists from Britain's IndependentTelevision Network 24 hours to leave the country. Vernon Mann andJohn Elphinstone, both in China on temporary visas, had been filmingthe aftermath of protests in the southwestern city of Chengdu.   Another ITN reporter was ordered expelled from Shanghai lastweek. Two Beijing-based reporters, John Pomfret of The AssociatedPress and Alan Pessin of the Voice of America, were scheduled toleave China on Saturday after being ordered out.   Chinese authorities accused all of the journalists of violatingmartial law regulations, which ban coverage of the protests.   The American Committee of the International Press Instituteissued a statement in Philadelphia deploring the expulsions.   ``It is essential ... that reporters or organizations such as TheAssociated Press have the access and opportunity to report,'' saidEugene L. Roberts, executive editor of The Philadelphia Inquirer andcommittee chairman.   ``We urge the leaders of the People's Republic to reinstate JohnPomfret and to increase, not decrease, access to events in China,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
