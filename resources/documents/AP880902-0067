(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Airboats fanned out over Lake Okeechobeefor the first statewide alligator hunt in 26 years, a 30-dayreprieve aimed at thinning out the once endangered species whosethick hides fetch $42 a foot.   ``We could have filled our 15-gator limit tonight,'' WarrenSchafer boasted about four hours after the hunting season openedThursday night. He displayed his prey: three gators ranging fromseven to 10 feet long.   ``It wasn't as hard as other animals I've hunted,'' saidSchafer, 45, of Miami, a veteran big-game hunter.   Across Florida starting at sundown, more than 200 huntersselected by the state began to search for their red-eyed prey withflashlights and head lamps.   Harpoons, snares and bows and arrows are about the only weaponspermitted. Most alligators are taken alive, their jaws secured withduct tape, and are delivered to processing plants still kicking.Some are killed with a ``bang-stick,'' a device that shoots acartridge on impact. Guns are prohibited because the gators oftensink after being shot.   On Lake Okeechobee, hunters, reporters and a few sightseersdeparted under the din of airboats and through a mist churned up bytheir large propellers. Bugs fluttered about like snowflakes in thehunters' lights.   Thomas Alpern, 25, a free-lance writer from New York City, saidto be the only Northerner who received a permit, was stillsearching for his first alligator at midnight with the aid of aprofessional trapper.   ``Who knows?'' he said. ``Maybe I won't even be able to kill itonce we find one.''   But Alpern, like many hunters, couldn't ignore the profitableside of the hunt. In addition to the lucrative hides, gator meatsells for up to $6 a pound.   ``The money is the big factor,'' said Rodney Crawford, a19-year-old cook from Lake Worth, who will hunt on Lake George inFlorida.   State game officers are closely monitoring the hunt for poachersand permit-holders using illegal weapons or taking gators below the4-foot minimum length.   Since federal anti-poaching methods were adopted in 1970, thealligator population in Florida has about doubled to an estimated 1million. Nearly 1,000 gators have been captured in experimentalhunts since 1981, and the September season will be isolated to 28districts where the alligator population is extraordinarily high.   Tom Stice, a biologist with the state Game and Fresh Water FishCommission, said a cross section of the public was sought for thehunt to expand interest in alligators.   The 238 hunters, selected from about 5,000 applications,attended a six-hour, state-sponsored training session and signedliability waivers.   Stice estimated the hunters will capture 65 to 70 percent of thepossible maximum of 3,450.   For state wildlife officials, the hunt follows a nearly 20-yeareffort to preserve the Florida alligator, which averages about 10feet in length.   The last state-approved hunt for sport was in 1962, when theAmerican alligator was declared endangered and hunting alligatorsin Florida was banned. As its numbers increased, however, officialsdowngraded the alligator from endangered to threatened and thestate gradually relaxed hunting restrictions.   ``People are getting gator phobia,'' said Lee Kramer of DelrayBeach, who captures nuisance alligators for the state. ``I got acall the other day in Boca (Raton) and it turned out to be aninflatable pool alligator that blew into a ditch.''   Allan Woodward, head of alligator research for the gamecommission, theorized that the alligator population was not asdecimated as previously thought during the height of poaching inthe 1960s.   ``They've really surprised us,'' he said. ``They're a prettyhardy animal.''</TEXT></DOC>
