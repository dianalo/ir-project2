(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The biggest commercial airplaneorder in history was split Monday between Boeing Co. and AirbusIndustrie of Europe, with Boeing grabbing the lion's share of the$5.04 billion, 130-plane purchase by International Lease FinanceCorp.   The planes are to be delivered over the next six years toInternational Lease Finance, which leases planes to many of theworld's airlines for periods of three to 11 years.   All are so-called advanced technology planes, which haverelatively quite engines and incorporate other recent developments.   Boeing's workhorse 737 series snagged the biggest chunk of theorder _ 72 of the 100 Boeing planes ordered _ and a mix ofwide-body and jumbo jets make up the rest of the purchase from theSeattle company. The Boeing order is worth $3.69 billion.   Airbus, a consortium of European aerospace companies led by itsFrench and German partners, will sell the leasing company 30 planesfor $1.35 billion. Eighteen of the Airbus planes will be A320-200s,medium-range airliners similar to the 737, and the rest of theorder is for wide-body jets.   Both manufacturers termed the agreement a marketing victory.   ``It's a tremendous order,'' said Dean Thornton, president ofBoeing Commercial Airplanes Co.   Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese called the order a welcomevote of confidence following the recent failure of an AlohaAirlines Boeing 737 over Hawaii. The top of the passenger cabinripped off that plane in flight, throwing a flight attendant to herdeath, but the pilot managed to land safely.   ``We really need it after everything that happened,'' Ms. Reesesaid of the order.   Airbus' share falls only slightly shy of matching theconsortium's U.S. strategy, which calls for gaining 30 percent ofthe market, said Gregg Schulte, spokesman at Airbus' U.S. office inHerndon, Va.   ``We feel like we got a very competitive part of the order.''Schulte said. ``I think it was always going to be a split order.''   Airbus also announced Monday it had received an order for 15A320s from Iberia Airlines.   A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., theother top competitor in the international market for commercialairliners, said last week the company did not expect a share of theInternational Lease Finance order.   The Boeing order consists of 72 planes of models 737-300,737-400 and 737-500; eight 757-200s; nine 767-300ERs; four747-400s; and a previously unannounced order of six planes in the737 series and one 757-200.   The Airbus order consists of 18 model A320-200s; fourA300-600Rs; six A310-300s, and two A340-300s.   Boeing valued its share of the contract at $4.6 billion,counting toward that total the price of 24 additional planes onwhich the company has options to buy.   With Airbus, International Lease Finance said it had an optionto buy an additional 40 planes.   The largest civilian airplane order to date was in 1986, whenBritish Airways ordered 16 Boeing 747s for $2.3 billion. That dealincludes options for 12 more of the jumbo jets that would bring thevalue to $4.1 billion.   International Lease Finance is confident customers will emergefor the approximately 25 planes a year the order will add to itsfleet of 54, said Kenneth Taylor, vice president for technicalservices.   He said the 15-year-old company would finance the purchasethrough debt offerings and internally generated funds. Deliveriesare set to begin in 1989 and run through 1995.   The purchase is intended to meet anticipated demand forfuel-efficient, quiet planes to replace aging airline fleets andaccommodate expanded business from 1990 to 1995, said StevenUdvar-Hazy, president of the leasing company.   Leasing has become increasingly attractive to airlines becauseit offers both tax advantages and an opportunity to keep cash inhand rather than commit it to down payments and interest on loans,analysts said.   ``The airlines think they need a lot of cash around, and I thinkthey're right, partly in the fear of some kind of fare war,'' saidAndrew Geller, who follows the industry for Provident National Bankin Philadelphia.   International Lease Finance also announced it had commitments tosupply engines for the planes from General Electric-CFMInternational, Pratt andamp; Whitney and from Rolls Royce. The enginespurchased will in some cases depend on the airline a particularplane is destined for, Taylor said.   The GE-CFM committments are worth an estimated $700 million andthe Pratt andamp; Whitney commitments worth $230 million. A value was notgiven for the Rolls Royce share.</TEXT></DOC>
