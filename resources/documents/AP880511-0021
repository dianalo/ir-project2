A smooth ride for the legislation was virtually assured twoweeks ago, after Attorney General Edwin Meese III and lawenforcement groups agreed to a compromise version _ and theNational Rifle Association went along.   The NRA agreed to avoid a bruising gun control battle inCongress when it became clear that no existing handguns would beprohibited under the agreement.   Plastic guns are not yet a reality, but chief House sponsorWilliam J. Hughes said Tuesday the firearms could be a weapon ofchoice for terrorists in the future. His colleagues agreed, passingthe bill 413-4.   The Senate Judiciary subcommittee on the Constitution, meanwhilecleared a similar bill by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum for action bythe full committee. The full panel meets again on Thursday, and thegun bill is on the agenda.   The Hughes bill would make it illegal to manufacture, import,sell, transfer or possess a plastic firearm, defined as a weaponwith less than 3.7 ounces of metal.   Maximum penalties would be five years in prison, and fines of$250,000 for individuals and $1 million for organizations.   The bill contains a ``sunset'' provision that would repeal thecriminal provisions after five years, enabling the law to keep pacewith any advances that may occur in firearms detection technology.   Voting against the House measure were Republican Reps. DickCheney of Wyoming; Philip Crane of Illinois; Norman Shumway ofCalifornia and Barbara Vucanovich of Nevada.   Hughes' bill was introduced before the administration-policecompromise, but embodies the same concept.   The more precise language is in the Senate version, which wouldestablish a detectability standard that would permit detection ofthe same weapons as the Hughes bill. However, it does not providefor a minimum content of metal in the gun.   Both measures would detect all existing hanguns, thus keepingthem legal for law-abiding owners. But plastic weapons that failedto meet the same metallic standard would be prohibited.   Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, called the House vote ``a major step in theright direction. I look forward to working with Congressman Hughesto make sure the Congress sends the president the strongest billpossible,'' he said Tuesday.   Hughes said he saw no problem in working out a compromisebetween the House and Senate language.   A Winter Park, Fla., company that claims to be the leader inplastic firearms technology says it has no plans to produce plastichandguns.   Dwight C. Brunoehler, vice president of Red Eye Arms Inc., saidthe company was working on a plastic machine gun grenade launcherthat it hopes to sell to the Marines.   ``We see the military business as where we want to be,'' hesaid, adding the company will be working on that project for atleast the next two years. He said the company also has pledgednever to make an undetectable plastic weapon.</TEXT></DOC>
