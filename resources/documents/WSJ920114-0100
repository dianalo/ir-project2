He was the first Japanese lawmaker taken intocustody since 1976.   Japanese media have carried daily reports alleging thatthe lawmaker, Fumio Abe, a former secretary-general of Mr.Miyazawa's Liberal Democratic Party faction, had acceptedbribes from a company facing fraud charges. The 69-year-oldMr. Abe resigned the post in Mr. Miyazawa's party faction andwent into hiding after reports last month alleged he receivedabout $4 million from steel-frame maker Kyowa Corp. Of thatamount, prosecutors believe that about $634,000 was a bribe,according to Japanese news reports.</LP><TEXT>   Although none of the media reports on Mr. Abe has linkedMr. Miyazawa personally or other politicians to the briberyallegations, the charges nevertheless have become a majorembarrassment for the prime minister as the case grew intoone of the biggest scandals here since an influence-peddlingscheme forced Noboru Takeshita to resign as prime minister in1989.   The Tokyo district prosecutor's office, in keeping withestablished practice, declined to comment on the case. TheMiyazawa faction's office said it had been informed of thearrest. Mr. Abe was unavailable for comment.   His arrest was the first of a member of Japan's Parliamentsince 1976, when former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka wasarrested on charges of receiving a multimillion dollar bribefor helping Lockheed Corp. sell airplanes. That conviction isstill under appeal.   According to Japanese news reports, Mr. Abe allegedly usedhis influence as director-general of the Hokkaido DevelopmentAgency to help Kyowa win construction contracts in Hokkaido,the northernmost of Japan's four main islands. The reportscharge that Mr. Abe provided Kyowa -- which has sincedeclared bankruptcy -- with blueprints of plans for a highwayto be built in the region.   A man linked to Mr. Abe, former Kyowa vice president GoroMoriguchi, is on trial in connection with an alleged $29million swindle involving advance payments from tradingcompanies. News reports alleged Mr. Abe accepted money andother favors, including the chance to meet with his favoriteactress, Yoko Yamamoto, from Mr. Moriguchi for helping toconceal the fraudulent deals.   In the late 1980s, Mr. Miyazawa and other senior politicalleaders received thousands of bargain-priced shares of stockin a subsidiary of Recruit Co., an information conglomerate.Although the scandal forced Mr. Takeshita to resign as primeminister, and Mr. Miyazawa stepped down as finance minister,most of the implicated politicians did not face courtcharges. They said they had been absolved when they wonre-election last year. Some trials are still pending.</TEXT></DOC>
