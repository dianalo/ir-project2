In ``Weekend at Bernie's,'' McCarthy and Jonathan Silverman areinsurance company yuppies invited for a holiday at their boss'palatial beach house in the Hamptons on Long Island in New York.They arrive to find their host executed by the Mafia. The rest ofthe movie concerns the two men's efforts to make Bernie seem aliveto his many friends and party guests.   While some critics have called ``Weekend at Bernies'' a one-jokemovie, most admit that it is often hilarious. They especially citethe performance of the corpse, who is actor Terry Kiser. There areeven predictions that the film could be the summer's sleeper.   McCarthy admitted he had qualms about playing opposite a stiff.   ``I laughed when I read the script,'' he said, ``but I alsothought, `This can be very morbid.' But somehow it all seemed soharmless to me.   ``Terry, who plays Bernie, is so good at it. He's one guy whenhe's alive, and somebody else when he's dead. He's never dead,really. It just takes the curse off it somehow. We treat him as ifhe were just another guy.   ``You find yourself laughing in spite of yourself. I saw thepicture and I did my usual cringing (about his performance). Then Ifound myself laughing, it's so disarming.''   McCarthy observed that Kiser ``didn't have any lines to learn, hejust lay there and got all the laughs.'' But Kiser did get tossedaround, and he suffered a few broken ribs that sidelined him for awhile.   ``Weekend at Bernie's'' marks a departure for Andrew McCarthy.   ``It was so refreshing for me because I'm used to playing a nice,sensitive, moral guy who does the right thing,'' he commented.``That can be a little boring, in real life as well as movies.   ``I thought Larry (his character) is a terrific guy because hethought he was very savvy and worldly and witty, and the babes lovedhim. Of course he's wrong about everything. Underneath it all he'slike a scared little kid. But he puts on a wonderful performance forthe world. He's selfish in a lot of things, but he couldn't hurt afly.''   McCarthy's early film career cast him as teen-agers in such filmsas ``Class,'' ``Heaven Help Us'' and ``Pretty in Pink'' even when hewas in his 20s. Now 26, he minimizes the matter of the transition toadulthood.   ``That's one of those questions that other people seem to beconcerned about,'' he said. ``I played teen-agers because I was ateen-ager. I played 20-year-olds because I was 20.   ``I don't want to be 30 years old playing a guy who's borrowingDad's car to go out to the movies. But I think if you tend tobusiness, those things take care of themselves.''   Born in Westfield, N.J., Andrew McCarthy started in high schoolplays, studied acting at New York Universiry and New York's Circlein the Square. After two years of schooling, he answered a cattlecall for the role of a preppie who has an affair with his roommate'smother (Jacqueline Bisset) in ``Class.''   His parents' reaction to his acting career?   ``When I said I was going to college for acting, they said fine,as long as I was going to college. When I called up and said I wasgoing to play Jacqueline Bisset's lover in a movie, my dad said,`Bring her home to dinner, son.'''   McCarthy, who recently bought a house in Greenwich Village, is aconfirmed Easterner.   ``I love New York, I'm comfortable there,'' he said. ``I like thepace, I like the environment. I'm not comfortable here. I don't likegetting in the car to go to the 7-11. I'm more comfortable where myfriends and family are.   ``Here everyone I know eats, lives, breathes the business. Showbusiness. It's got its place, but not 24 hours a day for me.''   About being a celebrity: ``In New York nobody cares, they justcare that they're going to beat you to that cab. People in New Yorkare just trying to get through the day, which is not necessarilygood. But I don't have any problems. And I don't travel in circlesthat are very show-biz oriented.''   McCarthy was leaving for France, where he will appear as theyoung Henry Miller in ``Quiet Days at Clichy,'' directed by ClaudeChabrol. The actor will be appearing in a film unlikely to achieve awide release, at a fraction of his usual salary.   ``It's one of those opportunities that is too good to pass up,''he explained. ``To play something that is offbeat and work withwonderful European guys and play a wonderful character. Knock onwood, something may come of it that people approve of.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, July 21-23</NOTE></DOC>
