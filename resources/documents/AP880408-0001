The Washington Post reported in Saturday's editions that theguidelines will guard against employee cheating by requiring thattoilet water be dyed blue to prevent dilution of urine. Temperaturereadings will be taken from the samples to detect substitution.   Quoting an unidentified government source, the newspaper saidnext week's printing in the Federal Register will be followed by acertification by Health and Human Services that all federalagencies have a drug-testing program that meets the guidelines.   Although all agencies have submitted plans outlining who will betested and for what drugs, the final certification date wasunclear. Agencies will be required to test for cocaine andmarijuana, but may test for PCP, opiates and amphetamines.   Finally, the Office of Management and Budget must estimate thecost of implementation to Congress before the regulations becomeeffective. The working estimate is thought to be ``about $7million,'' the paper said.   The new guidelines draw heavily on the experience of the testingwhich has been conducted in the military for the last seven years.Currently, the Department of Transportation is the onlynon-military agency testing employees in sensitive jobs.   The American Federation of Government Employees, which has filedsuit in federal district court in New Orleans against earlierinformal standards, contends the random drug testing violatesworkers' constitutional rights.</TEXT></DOC>
