The 380-25 vote sent the measure to an uncertain fate in the Senate, where the Finance Committee has approved a much narrower bill.    The House bill would increase taxes for, among others, military contractors and corporations that own stock in other corporations. Altogether, it would raise $7.1 billion in revenue over the next three years to pay for extending several expiring provisions, including the research-and-development tax credit. It would also make technical corrections to the 1986 tax-law overhaul.    The strong support for the bill in the House stems from the eagerness of lawmakers to give away a series of tax breaks to groups ranging from artists and authors to pistachio farmers and cattle ranchers. &quot;This bill contains a substantial number of provisions that will benefit literally millions of taxpayers,&quot; said House Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) But he said it doesn't include special relief for specific taxpayers or corporations.    The version approved by the Senate Finance Committee, however, omits most of the special-interest benefits and tax increases. Moreover, Senate tax-writers seem strongly opposed to putting them in.    &quot;This year we will have a narrow tax bill or we won't have a bill,&quot; said Sen. Robert Packwood of Oregon, ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. &quot;The president will veto any tax bill that has as much taxes as the House bill has.&quot;    But the big margin in favor of the bill yesterday could make the House hold out for a broader bill when the House and Senate meet to iron out differences after the Senate passes a tax bill, probably in September. If the House and Senate remain far apart on a tax bill, it could fall victim to pressure on the lawmakers to go back home and campaign for elections this fall.    The tax benefits in the bill would:   --Permanently exempt mutual funds from a provision of the 1986 tax law requiring that certain investment expenses be deducted by individual shareholders rather than by the fund itself. Shareholders had to count these expenses as &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions,&quot; which may be taken only to the extent that they exceed 2% of the taxpayer's income. This had the effect of making the shareholders pay a part of the fund's operating expenses. Congress had passed an exemption for 1987.    --Extend the 20% research-and-development credit for two years. It is scheduled to expire at year end.    --Extend a provision that eases the tax treatment of research-and-development expenses that support foreign operations.    --Exempt farmers, construction companies and other off-road users of diesel fuel from paying the federal tax. The tax doesn't apply to off-road use, but current law requires such users to pay it and apply for a refund at the end of the year.    --Extend for two years a credit given to employers who hire economically disadvantaged workers.    --Extend, in altered form, a tax break for employer-provided education expenses.    --Extend a credit for low-income housing.    --Exempt free-lance writers, photographers, artists, pistachio farmers and some livestock producers from a rule that bars taxpayers from deducting certain production expenses before a project produces income.    The bill also would remove the limit on the amount of long-term bonds the Treasury can issue.    The bill contains several revenue-raising provisions to pay for the tax breaks, including a boost in taxes for defense companies and other long-term contractors. The provision would end the so-called completed contract method of accounting, which allows companies to defer taxes on income from long-term contracts. Ending it would raise an estimated $2.4 billion in revenue through fiscal year 1991.    The legislation also would reduce the deduction allowed corporations for the portfolio dividends they receive from other companies, a provision that is strongly opposed by the Reagan administration. &quot;I will work to eliminate these two provisions in conference with the Senate,&quot; said Rep. Bill Archer (R., Texas), who nevertheless supported the bill yesterday.    Other tax increases would come from a restriction on the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations, an acceleration in corporate estimated tax payments and curbs on life insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters. Also included are a new tax on pipe tobacco and a measure to slow depreciation on some farm equipment.    The Senate Finance Committee's bill contains little more than corrections of the technical mistakes in the 1986 bill and the diesel-fuel provision demanded by farmers.    Senate Democrats, eager to help Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen sidestep controversy as he runs for vice president, are likely to favor a streamlined tax bill without controversial measures that the Texas Democrat might have to defend in the campaign. And Senate Republicans aren't eager to approve the sizable tax boosts needed to give away tax benefits. </TEXT></DOC>
