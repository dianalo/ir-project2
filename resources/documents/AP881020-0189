(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ritualistic beatings apparently were aroutine part of athletic training for 55 children who were takeninto protective custody after they were forced to watch the beatingdeath of an 8-year-old girl.   The children, mostly from the Watts area of Los Angeles, werekept in a sparsely furnished four-bedroom farmhouse near Sandy,about 30 miles southeast of Portland.   Authorities say the children were subjected to whippings of upto 800 strokes with a paddle or electrical cord while the otherswere forced to watch and keep count.   The beatings were an integral part of the group's program toheighten athletic performance, much like harassment used inmilitary training, said Donald Welch, director of the ClackamasCounty Juvenile Court.   Although the children were removed from the house a week ago,parents have made no attempt to reclaim the youngsters, said AliceGalloway, spokeswoman for the state Children's Services Division.   Many of the parents came to Oregon and set up interviews withsocial workers, but canceled them abruptly at the request ofEcclesia Athletic Association founder Eldridge Broussard Jr., shesaid.   The parents display ``no lack of confidence in EldridgeBroussard,'' she said. ``They trust him implicitly.''   The dead child was Broussard's daughter, Dayna Lorae.   In an appearance on Oprah Winfrey's syndicated television talkshow Thursday, Broussard blamed negative news coverage for hisdaughter's death.   He also denied that children were beaten or abused, saying theywere only ``spanked.''   ``Abuse may be anything that does not prepare them to be ontheir toes in a rather paranoid, trigger-happy Los Angelessituation,'' he said. ``We teach our children the moment someone ofauthority says something to you, you snap to it.''   Asked why he thought his daughter was dead, Broussard said,``The Lord determined we were supposed to pass through this rightnow.''   He said the standards of discipline were much different betweenOregon and gang- and drug-ridden Watts.   ``In Watts, parents have seen brutality that would trip the mindof the average American,'' he said. ``The people that are a part ofmy school, when they see brutal, they see ears coming off, they seegiant huge lacerations.   ``I wish someone would come from Los Angeles and examine thesechildren. I contend ... we would get conflicting reports.''   The Ecclesia Athletic Association first used the farm as anathletic training camp a year ago.   Broussard formed Ecclesia in 1975 to steer children away fromdrugs and crime and to motivate them through tough discipline andathletics. It is now operating under the auspices of the WattsChristian Center, founded by Broussard's father in the 1950s.   Broussard, a former college basketball star, said negativepublicity when Ecclesia arrived in Oregon last year cost his groupfinancial backing and led to suspension of its activities a yearago. As a result, Broussard said, staff members were performingduties they weren't qualified for.   On Oct. 14, four of the group's staff members took the Broussardgirl's body to a nearby fire station. She had been beaten andwhipped, and died from multiple blunt force injuries, MedicalExaminer Larry Lewman said.   That night, 53 children were taken from the house, where theywere sharing sleeping bags on the floor. Investigators said thechildren, ranging in age from 1{ months to 16 years, had eaten onlya tomato apiece that day.   Two other children involved with the group were taken intocustody in Los Angeles.   Broussard, who came to Portland from Los Angeles after thegirl's death, said in a statement addressed to the news media:``Now, murder's involved. And I accuse you on national televisionof murder in the first degree.''   Broussard, 35, was a basketball star at Pacific University inForest Grove, Ore., and later tried out with the Portlan TrailBlazers, surviving until the final cut.   He later won praise in Los Angeles for the sportsmanship andgood manners of the Ecclesia youngsters, after the group renovateda gymnasium and formed a 32-team basketball league.   Last year, Broussard's organization brought more than 70 adultsand children to the Oregon farmhouse to form an athletic trainingcenter for the children. The group proposed living in tents on an18{-acre farm, using portable toilets and showers.   Neighbors opposed the plans, expressing concern over the``militaristic'' treatment of the children, who they said appearedto be doing mostly manual labor and calisthenics.   They also pointed to an Ecclesia ``vow of poverty'' thatrequired the signer to ``declare all of my ambitions, desires, pastand future commitments, relationships, expectations, assets, gifts,talents and connections under the total control of Eldridge JohnBroussard Jr. ... I relinquish even the rights of decision-making.''   Ecclesia withdrew its zoning permit applications and returned toLos Angeles two months later.   The children were returned to Oregon in late July and had beenscheduled to return to Los Angeles as soon as a new youth centerwas completed, said Broussard's spokeswoman, Carolyn Van Brunt.   Six of Broussard's associates have been charged in connectionwith the girl's death: four with manslaughter and two withhindering prosecution. Broussard's brother Alvin was arrested forinvestigation of child endangerment at the Watts Christian Center.</TEXT></DOC>
