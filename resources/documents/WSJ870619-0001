Mr. Kohlberg said his departure resulted from &quot;philosophical differences&quot; with his partners. He declined to elaborate on the differences, but added, &quot;I'm proud of what's been built up.&quot; He said he left on amicable terms with Henry Kravis and George R. Roberts, co-founders with whom he has been associated for 23 years.    In an interview, Mr. Kohlberg, who turns 62 next month, said he announced his decision to leave the firm about a month ago at the firm's investor conference. He said he still would have a financial interest in Kohlberg Kravis, whose name will remain the same.    Kohlberg Kravis, since its founding in 1976, has become the leading leveraged buyout firm in the country. Wall Street executives have estimated the partners' worth between $150 million and $500 million. Using billions of dollars supplied by institutional investors, the firm became a major force in corporate takeovers and restructurings by arranging leveraged buyouts, where companies are taken private using large amounts of borrowed funds. The borrowings are ultimately repaid from the cash flow of the companies or through sales of assets. Kohlberg Kravis has arranged $30 billion in leveraged buyouts.    Mr. Kohlberg said he plans to start up, with his son and three others, Kohlberg andamp; Co., a new leveraged buyout firm. Asked whether he will be competing with Kohlberg Kravis, Mr. Kohlberg said, &quot;I don't think so.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
