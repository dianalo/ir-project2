The steps are: generatinga beam of coherent optical pumping radiation from a diode laser; directingthe beam of optical pumping radiation through a solid member of generallynon-birefringent lasant material to optically pump the member of lasantmaterial and to provide a gain bandwidth having a characteristic peakedgain curve; disposing the member of lasant material within an opticalresonator having an optical axis passing through the member of lasantmaterial for exciting resonant axial modes of the optical resonator withcoherent optical radiation at optical wavelengths; dimensioning the opticalpath length of the optical resonator to be sufficiently short such thatessentially only two adjacent non-polarized optical resonant axial modesof the resonator will lase when centered in frequency on opposite sidesof the peak of the gain curve within the optical resonator containingthe optically pumped member of lasant material; and stressing the memberof lasant material to produce therein a stress with a predominant componenttransverse to the optical axis of the optical resonator to produce astress related birefringence of the lasant material causing linear polarizationof the two excited axial modes of the optical resonator.</TEXT></DOC>
