Wages will increase an average 2.5% annually over the life of the contracts, which generally run two to three years.    When these workers bargained over wages two to three years ago, settlements resulted in first-year increases averaging 1.7% and yearly gains that averaged 2.6% over the life of the contracts. Generally, gains in union wage settlements have been shrinking in recent years, reflecting continuing pressure on companies and unions to keep wage gains modest.    Of the approximately 732,000 workers covered by big labor contracts settled in the first half of the year, 488,000 had first-year wage increases, 52,000 had first-year decreases, and 192,000 had no wage change for that year. These contracts included workers in the steel, transportation, construction, retail, food, real estate and service industries.    In manufacturing, the contract settlements will result in first-year wage increases averaging 0.8% annually over the life of the contracts. More than half of those workers were covered by lump-sum payments.    Settlements in non-manufacturing industries covered almost 75% of workers under contract during the first half. They included first-year wage gains averaging 2.9% and yearly gains averaging 3.1% over the life of the contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
