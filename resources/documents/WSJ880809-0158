Pearson, which has interests in publishing, banking and fine china, said pretax profit rose to #81.7 million ($138.1 million) from #51.2 million a year earlier. Group sales rose 18%, to #496.2 million ($838.6 million) from #420.7 million.    The sharp jump in pretax profit reflected a #20.8 million trading profit from the sale of a shopping-center site and a retail warehouse park in Britain. Excluding the effects of those sales and recent acquisitions, pretax profit rose 12%, to #57.5 million, Pearson said.    Net income increased 12%, to #51.1 million from #45.7 million. Pearson took an extraordinary loss of #900,000 in the latest six months, compared with an extraordinary gain of #14.1 million a year earlier.    The results were better than market expectations of pretax profit between #70 million and #77 million. Pearson's shares were quoted at 790 pence ($13.35) in late trading yesterday on London's stock exchange, up from 786 pence Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
