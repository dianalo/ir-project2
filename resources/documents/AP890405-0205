Anis Naccache issued a statement from his cell ``calling on allMoslems in Europe to preserve their unity faced with plots aimed atIslam and Moslems,'' Agence France-Presse reported.   Naccache is serving a life sentence for the unsuccessful attemptto assassinate former Iranian Prime Minister Shapour Bakhtiar in1980. He signed the statement: ``Anis Naccache. Spokesman of theHezbollah in Europe.''   His lawyer, Jacques Verger, confirmed that Naccache issued thestatement, AFP reported.   Hezbollah, meaning Party of God, is made up of Iranian-backedLebanese Shiite Moslem extremists. It is believed to be theumbrella group for various factions holding 15 foreigners,including nine Americans, in Lebanon.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   Naccache called on fellow Moslems to support Iranian AyatollahRuhollah Khomeini's call for the death of Salman Rushdie, author of``The Satanic Verses.''   Many Moslems believe the book blasphemes Islam because itscharacters include prostitutes who take the names of the prophetMohammed's wives. The novel also suggests that Mohammed wrote theholy Koran rather than receiving it from Allah.   Rushdie has been in hiding in Britain since Khomeini called forhis death on Feb. 14.</TEXT></DOC>
