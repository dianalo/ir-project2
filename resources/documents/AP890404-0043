Carmine Esposito received the order Monday, but it could takemoths before his is deported to his native Italy, said CraigOswald, assistant counsel for the Immigration and NaturalizationService.   Oswald said Judge Craig M. Zerbe weighed the positive factors inEsposito's case _ his wife and one of his children are U.S.citizens _ against negative factors that included Esposito'salleged membership in an Italian criminal clan similar to the Mafiaand his entry into the United States on a false passport.   The negative factors ``weigh overwhelmingly against an exerciseof judgment on (Esposito's) behalf,'' the judge decided.   Philip Parenti, Esposito's attorney, said he planned tochallenge the ruling before the Board of Immigration Appeals.   ``We're appealing the fact that they can't use foreignconvictions to deport somebody,'' Parenti said.   ``Basically they're trying to accomplish through the back doorwhat they couldn't do through extradition.''   Authorities originally tried to deport Esposito on an Italianextradition memo, but the Italian charges were dropped afterEsposito was not brought to trial within 18 months of his arrest asrequired by law in Italy.   Italian authorities charged that Esposito ordered or committed12 killings in Italy from April 1982 through June 1983 whileholding a top post in the Nuova Camorra Organizzata, a criminalclan that operates in and around Naples, near Esposito's home townof Acerra.   When those charges were dropped, U.S. authorities shifted thecase to immigration courts, moving to deport Esposito on groundsthat he entered the United States illegally.   Esposito, 31, was arrested in March 1988 at his North Siderestaurant. He also had worked as an auto-body repairman, carsalesman and sausage-maker.</TEXT></DOC>
