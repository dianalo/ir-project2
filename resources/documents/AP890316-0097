The continued detention of Anderson and other hostages in Lebanon``is a criminal act which serves no cause,'' State Departmentspokesman Charles Redman said in a statement.   ``The hostage-holders should release their captives immediatelyand unconditionally, and we call on all countries with influenceover the hostages, such as Iran, to use that influence to obtainfreedom for all the hostages,'' Redman said.   President Bush ``certainly is concerned about the hostages,''White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said in Houston, where Bushwas making a speech. He said the United States will continuesefforts to seek the release of Anderson and eight other Americanhostages.   At a ceremony on Capitol Hill marking Anderson's fourth year as acaptive, his sister, Peggy Say of Cadiz, Ky., said Anderson, acorrespondent for The Associated Press, is ``frustrated, tired andlonely ... and tired of being caged like an animal.''   In a message transmitted to the news agency's staff, AP PresidentLouis D. Boccardi said ``our hearts cry out in protest'' overAnderson's plight.   ``It's time for those holding Terry Anderson to release him andto end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man. Each of usin our own special way should mark this day with contemplation andprayer for Terry's release,'' Boccardi continued.   ``As has been true from the beginning on that Saturday morning in1985, our efforts on his behalf will continue in all corners of theworld until our brave friend is free once more.''   Tom Brokaw of NBC News, who moderated an hour-long ceremony in aHouse office building, said Anderson has not been forgotten as heenters his fifth year as a captive in a small, dingy room.   ``We can't turn our backs when people are denied human rights,''Brokaw said.   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former hostage held for a timewith Anderson, said that before his release on July 26, 1986, hepromiseed the journalist ``that I would never forget him, thatothers would never forget him.''   Colleagues who knew and worked with Anderson, one of nineAmerican hostages held in Lebanon, talked of his dedication to hisjob and his desire to tell the story of the war-torn nation.   ``He took big risks ... and he has paid an awful price these lastfour years,'' said David Ignatius, an associate editor of TheWashington Post. ``I want to see Terry released tomorrow, ifpossible.''   Thomas Friedman, diplomatic correspondent for The New York Times,said the radical Moslem Shiites believed to hold Anderson aredamaging Islam's image by keeping hostages. ``The only way yourstory is ever going to be told again is if our comrades are free,''he said.   Bruce Laingen, a former hostage in Iran, echoed that thought. Thehostage-holders are doing a ``grievous disservice to Islam,'' hesaid at the event, which was co-sponsored by No Greater Love, ahumanitarian organization, and the Journalists Committee to FreeTerry Anderson.   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., a member of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, attended the ceremony, as did Reps. CliffStearns, R-Fla.; Nick Joe Rahall, D-W.Va., and Thomas Foglietta,D-Pa. Also in attendance were Lebanese Ambassador Abdallah Bouhabiband Peter Burleigh, deputy assistant secretary of state for NearEast affairs.   On Wednesday, Moynihan said he would not accept ``the explanationthat nothing can be done.'' He was to introduce a resolution todayin the Senate condemning hostage-taking. ``Something must be done,the executive branch must seek to use every avenue, formal andinformal, to win the hostages freedom,'' Moynihan said in astatement.   Meantime, administration officials say there has been no changein the hostage policy since President Bush assumed office nearly twomonths ago.   ``In terms of our policy, there has been no change, and I don'tforesee one,'' said a State Department Mideast specialist, speakingon condition of anonymity. He called the policy the only one thatmight work.   Since the Reagan administration was embarrassed in November 1986by revelations it had sold weapons to Iran, the U.S. policy hasbeen, ``No concessions, but we're willing to talk to anyone,''another official said.   But Say has been critical of U.S. government efforts on behalf ofthe hostages.   ``You want to hope they are working on it, but let's face it,four years speaks for itself,'' she said. Say said she does notthink the Bush administration has made any new drives to free thehostages. ``Basically, things are just status quo.''   She listed specific initiatives the United States could pursue,including payments to the families of Iranians killed last July whenthe USS Vincennes shot down an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf.The State Department said it is working on a payment plan.   ``You begin to wonder what it takes to move people,'' Mrs. Saysaid. ``They have heard and read how hostages have died, how theyhave gone mad, how they exist from day-to-day in the most barbaricconditions and the world does not respond.''   Officials say different factions hold the nine American hostageswho have been seized in Lebanon, but they are elements of theumbrella group, Hezbollah, over which Iran exhibits control. TheUnited States has called for the unconditional release of allhostages before it will talk with Iran.   The families' frustration follows a brief sense of optimism thatfollowed Bush's Jan. 20 inaugural address in which he repeated hisopposition to any deals, but seemed to send a signal to the captors.   ``There are today Americans who are held against their will inforeign lands and Americans who are unaccounted for,'' Bush said.``Assistance can be show here, and will be long remembered. Goodwill begets good will.''   Since then, other developments have intervened, most recently thefuror over ``The Satanic Verses,'' a book by Salman Rushdie thatMoslems consider to be blasphemous. The Iranian government hascalled for Rushdie's death.   ``The situation has fallen apart again,'' Mrs. Say said.   Mammod Faksh, a professor of Middle Eastern studies at theUniversity of Southern Maine, said he doesn't expect any good newsfor the hostages soon.   ``The Lebanese civil war is still ongoing and there is morefactionalism in Lebanon now than ever,'' he said. ``So many thingsdon't bode well for the hostages. They are still alive because it isin the best interest of the hostage-takers to keep them alive.''   At the State Department, Michael Mahoney is the designatedcontact with the family members. He said he tries to call thefamilies every two weeks to reassure them ``someone is payingattention to them,'' and to put current events in their propercontext.   Mahoney also monitors the dozens of letters the departmentreceives each month from Americans on the hostages. In the 18 monthshe has worked at the job, Mahoney said he has not noticed any changein the volume.</TEXT></DOC>
