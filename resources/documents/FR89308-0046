The agency received numerous commentson the NPRM, representing the opinions of new and used car dealers, autoauctions, leasing companies, State motor vehicle administrators, and enforcementand consumer protection agencies. Each of the comments was considered anda final rule was published on August 5, 1988. 53 FR 29464 (1988).As required by the Truth in Mileage Act, the final rule requires the transferorof a motor vehicle to provide a mileage disclosure on the title documentor, if the title document does not include a space for the mileage disclosure(during the phase-in period), or if the vehicle has not been previouslytitled, it requires the transferor to make a written disclosure of mileageon a separate document. Also as required by that statute, the final rulerequires that title documents be manufactured or otherwise set forth bya secure process to deter counterfeiting and alteration; requires thatat the time of issue, the titles include the mileage disclosure; adds disclosurerequirements for lessors and lessees; and adds retention requirements forlessors and auction companies. In addition, consistent with the statute,the rule amends the form and content of the odometer disclosure statement.The rule also prohibits a person from signing the disclosure as both thetransferor and transferee in the same transaction in order to guard againsta situation where only one party to the transaction would be aware of thedisclosure. Finally, the final rule clarifies the definition of transferorand transferee and extends the record retention requirement for dealersand distributors.The Agency received seven petitions for reconsideration of the final rule.In addition, we received numerous letters concerning the final rule andsupporting the petitions. These petitions requested that NHTSA reconsiderthe provisions of the final rule that: (1) Prohibit a person from signingthe odometer disclosure statement as both the transferor and transfereein the same transaction; (2) define ``transferor'' and ``transferee'';(3) define ``secure printing process''; (4) concern the language includedon the odometer disclosure statement; and (5) require dealers and distributorsto retain, for five years, a copy of every odometer disclosure statement,including the transferee's signature, that they issue and receive. Thesepetitions and letters have been placed in the docket. Before the Agencycould fully consider the petitions, Congress enacted the Pipeline SafetyReauthorization Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-561.Section 401 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act, which amends section408(d)(1) of the Motor Vehicle Information and Cost Savings Act, 15 U.S.C.1988(d)(1), concerns the use of certain powers of attorney in connectionwith the required mileage disclosure. The new law directs the agency toprescribe the form and content of the power of attorney/disclosure documentand reasonable conditions for its use by the transferor, ``consistent withthis Act and the need to facilitate enforcement thereof.'' It also requiresNHTSA's rule to provide for the retention of a copy of the power of attorneyand to ensure that the person granted the power of attorney completes thedisclosure on the title consistent with the disclosure on the power ofattorney form.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope</ITAG>Consistent with the statutory mandate, this notice grants, in whole orin part, four of the petitions for reconsideration. Generally, two of thesepetitions concern the definition of transferor and transferee with regardto the person who acts as an agent for the transferor or transferee. Theother two petitions concern the relationship between the retention requirementapplicable to dealers and distributors and the requirement that the transferee'ssignature appear on the odometer disclosure statements. The most significantpoints of the four petitions are addressed below.In an interim final rule also published in today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>, NHTSA grants, in whole or in part, three petitionsfor reconsideration of the portion of the final rule that provides thata person shall not sign a disclosure statement as the transferor and transfereein the same transaction and implements the portion of the Pipeline SafetyReauthorization Act of 1988 that concerns the use of powers of attorneyto disclose mileage.NHTSA has denied, in whole or in part, three petitions for reconsiderationof the final rule published on August 5, 1988, because they are inconsistentwith the new statute. For reasons discussed in the document denying thepetitions, two other petitions were also denied. The denial notice is publishedin today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions</ITAG>To clarify that the liability for issuing a false odometer disclosure statementcould be placed on a person acting as an agent for the owner of a vehicle,in a notice issued on July 17, 1987, we proposed to amend the definitionof ``transferor'' and the definition of ``transferee'', contained in andSection;580.3, to include the agent of the transferor and transferee. 52 FR 27023(1987). Although one commenter feared that the definitions could be misconstruedto require that every agent who participates in the transfer must issuean odometer disclosure statement, we felt that the preamble to the finalrule permitted us to clarify the meaning of the definition without changingthe regulatory language, and the definitions were adopted as proposed.The National Independent Automobile Dealers Association (NIADA) and theNational Auto Auction Association (NAAA) have requested that NHTSA reconsiderthe definitions of transferor and transferee adopted in the final rule.NIADA asserts that the definitions should be expressly limited to a principalor an agent who signs the required disclosure on behalf of the owner. Withoutthis limitation, NIADA believes that that the definitions in the finalrule may subject agents of the transferor to liability for failure to complywith the odometer disclosure requirements, whether or not they have anyresponsibility for issuing an odometer disclosure statement. Likewise,NAAA claimed that the definitions were ambiguous. NAAA's argument was basedupon an apparent inconsistencly in the preamble to the final rule. NAAAnoted that while NHTSA defined ``transferor'' to include ``any person,who as agent, transfers the ownership of another'', 53 FR 29476 (1988),NHTSA also stated that ``transfer of ownership under State laws may notoccur at one point in time, but is a process.'' 53 FR 29468 (1988). Therefore,NAAA suggested that NHTSA define ``transferor'' to include any agent whoactually makes the required disclosure on behalf of the owner. NAAA alsosuggested that the definition of ``transferee'' be amended in a similarmanner.Even though NHTSA attempted to clarify the definitions in the preamble,it is apparent that some confusion still remains. The suggestions proposedby NIADA and NAAA are consistent with NHTSA's intention expressed in thepreamble to the NPRM and to the final rule. It has not been NHTSA's intentionto require that the transferee receive multiple odometer disclosure statements.Therefore, we are proposing to amend the portions of the definitions oftransferor and transferee concerning the transferor's and transferee'sagents. ``Transferor'' would be defined to include the transferor's agentwho signs any odometer disclosure statement on behalf of the transferor.Similarly, ``Transferee'' would be defined to include the transferee'sagent who signs any odometer disclosure statement. NHTSA requests commentson these proposed amendments to the definitions.NAAA included with its petition, eight scenarios of vehicle transfers andasked who would be the transferor. To assist those involved in the transferof vehicles to more fully understand the requirements of the law and ourproposed definitions, we have addressed each of these scenarios and theduties of the parties as they would be interpreted under those proposals:1. A, a retail customer with a trade-in, purchases a vehicle from B, adealer. The secured lender holds the title to A's trade-in. A gives B apower of attorney. B pays off the loan, obtains the title, and transfersownership pursuant to the power of attorney. A would be a transferor. B,A's agent, would also be a transferor. A would make a disclosure to B onthe secure power of attorney and B would make and sign a disclosure onthe title on A's behalf.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note: </T4>The use of the power of attorney in this instance wouldallow B to sign as both the transferor and transferee in the same transaction.Therefore, the power of attorney form must meet the requirements of section401 of the Pipeline Safety Reauthorization Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-561,and the interim final rule issued by NHTSA pursuant to the Act, which hasbeen published in today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4></ITAG>2. A, a wholesale dealer, sells a vehicle to B, a wholesale dealer. A givesB a power of attorney. B uses the power of attorney to transfer the ownershipto C after receiving the title documents from A. A is B's transferor andB is C's transferor. However, if A sells the car to B and gives B the title,it is unclear why A gave B a power of attorney. If B used A's power ofattorney to transfer the car to C and B's name did not appear on the titleas a buyer, B would be in violation of State laws which prohibit ``skippingtitle''. ``Skipping title'' means omitting an owner from the chain of ownership.3. A, a dealer, employs B as a salesperson. B sells A's car and signs thetransfer of ownership document. If the car is owned by A as a dealer andnot personally, both A and B would be transferors, and either A must issueand sign an odometer disclosure statement or B may issue and sign an odometerdisclosure statement on A's behalf.4. A is an independent contractor who buys and sells cars for B, a dealer.A sells B's cars and signs the transfer of ownership documents on behalfof B. A and B would be transferors, and A should issue and sign an odometerdisclosure statement on B's behalf.5. A and B are wholesale dealers. A sells a car to B through C, a wholesaleauction. C has not purchased the car and signs no transfer of ownershipdocuments. C obtains the title from A, pays A on B's behalf, and then deliversthe title to B. A would be the transferor and must issue and sign an odometerdisclosure statement to B.6. A and B are wholesale dealers. A sells a car to B through C, a wholesaleauction. C has not purchased the car, but signs transfer of ownership documents,pursuant to a power of attorney from A. C obtains the title from A, paysA on B's behalf, and then delivers title to B. A and C would be transferorsand C should issue an odometer disclosure statement to B, on behalf ofA.7. A is an attorney who is the personal representative of an estate. Asigns the transfer of ownership documents, transferring a vehicle thatis part of the estate to B, the beneficiary. The estate and A would bethe transferors, and A is required to issue and sign an odometer disclosurestatement on behalf of the estate.8. A is an attorney who is the personal representative of an estate. Asigns the transfer of ownership documents, transferring a vehicle thatis part of the estate to B, the beneficiary. C, A's secretary, carriesthe transfer of ownership documents to the state titling office to be processed.A new title will be issued in B's name. The estate and A would be transferors,and A is required to issue and sign an odometer disclosure statement onbehalf of the estate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Record Retention and Long-Distance Sales Transactions</ITAG>The NPRM of July 1987 proposed a new section 580.8 concerning the retentionof odometer disclosure statements by motor vehicle dealers, distributors,and lessors. This section proposed to increase, from four to five years,the length of time the dealers and distributors, required by this partto issue an odometer disclosure statement, shall retain odometer disclosurestatements. Since the Truth in Mileage Act requires that the disclosurebe on the title, transferors involved in long-distance transactions wereconcerned that their transferees would not return a signed copy of thedisclosure made on the title. (Currently, the disclosure is on a separatedocument and these transferors refuse to release the title until they receivethe signed disclosure statement.) PHH Group, Inc. (now PHH Corporation)(PHH) asserted that is not reasonable to place a legal requirement on thetransferor to retain records over which he does not have control and thatany transferee, with intent to commit fraud by tampering with the title,will simply alter the title after the transferor's copy has been made.PHH argued that since the States will be receiving and retaining fullyexecuted title documents, there seems to be little benefit to require transferorsto also retain these records. Therefore, PHH requested that the final rulerequire the transferor to retain only a copy of the disclosure statementprior to release of the document to the transferee. The American AutomotiveLeasing Association (AALA) suggested that the regulation allow a transferorwho is also a lessor, and therefore, involved in long-distance transactions,to fulfill the retention requirements by retaining a copy of the disclosurestatement, which is forwarded for the buyer's signature, and requestingthe buyer to sign the statement and return a copy.We did not grant the requests of PHH and AALA; the final rule was adoptedas proposed. In the preamble to the final rule of August 1988, we explainedthat requiring the transferor to retain a copy of the disclosure signedby the transferee is essential to enforcement. It prevents a buyers fromaltering the mileage and later alleging that the altered mileage is themileage he received from the transferor, since the transferor would havea copy of the disclosure with the higher mileage and the transferee's signature.This unaltered copy would not be on file in the State titling office. 53FR 29474 (1988). Because they are concerned that they will be found in violation of theretention requirements if their transferees do not return a copy of thetitle, including the signed disclosure, PHH and the National Associationof Fleet Administrators, Inc. (NAFA) have petitioned NHTSA to reconsiderthe retention requirements of the final rule. They feel that they haveno way to compel their transferees to return a signed copy of the disclosureand that section 580.8 of the rule, which requires a transferor to retaina copy of the disclosure that includes the transferee's signature, placesan unreasonable administrative and financial burden on them. NAFA and PHH proposed the following three alternatives: (1) An amendmentto the regulation to require the transferor to retain only a copy of hisdisclosure, not a disclosure signed by the transferee; (2) an amendmentto the regulation to specify what constitutes a good faith effort by atransferor to obtain a copy of a completed odometer disclosure statementfrom his transferee; and (3) an amendment to the regulation to requirea transferee to return a completed odometer disclosure statement to histransferor. In support of the first alternative, PHH and NAFA noted that since thedisclosure is on the title, a completed disclosure will be on file in theState Department of Motor Vehicles. They also noted that because titleswill be securely printed, transferees will be unable to alter the mileagedisclosed by the transferor on the titles. Finally, they claimed that thecost of obtaining a completed odometer disclosure statement, involvingmailing fees and administrative expenses, would outweigh the benefits ofthis requirement. NHTSA has not adopted this first alternative. As we stated in the preambleto the final rule, requiring the transferor to retain only a copy of hisdisclosure presents a problem for investigative and enforcement actions.This would permit a buyer to alter the mileage disclosure on the titleand later allege that the altered mileage is the mileage received fromhis transferor, since his transferor would not have a copy of disclosureon the title with the higher mileage and the transferee's signature. Werecognize that even with securely printed titles and reassignment documents,some alterations have been, and may continue to be, undetected upon initialreview by State Departments of Motor Vehicles. We have found that copiesof titles, made before the titles were altered, are an effective investigativeaid in determining whether the title has been altered and whether additionalanalysis of the title is needed. NAFA argues that NHTSA underestimated the costs of the retention requirementand that the benefits to be derived from the requirement of obtaining aphotocopy of the title do not outweigh the costs. In NHTSA's regulatoryevaluation of the final rule, NHTSA estimated the cost of this requirementto be $900,000. Regulatory Evaluation_Final Rule Implementing Truth inMileage Act of 1986. (April 1988; pages 43-44). (NAFA mistakenly claimsthat NHTSA estimated the costs of this provision to be $254,000, 2,540,000fleet vehicles andmultiply; .10). NAFA argues that while NHTSA has estimatedthe cost of photocopying the title, NHTSA did not consider the cost ofthis service provided by auto auctions and wholesalers. Because the serviceof providing a copy of the title will replace the current practice of providinga copy of the separate odometer statement, NHTSA sees no reason to considerthis cost; it is not a new cost imposed by the final rule. In addition to saving personnel time and lab/analysis costs, the recordretention requirement in the final rule is a vital part of the investigativeprocess, especially since a significant part of odometer fraud involvesvehicles that have been sold through long-distance transactions, thoseused by lease companies or in business fleets. A study by the IllinoisOffice of the Attorney General found that 49.8 percent of all one-timelease vehicles surveyed in twenty-three States during a one-year periodhad their odometers rolled back. A Washington State study estimated thatsixty percent of leased vehicles have their odometers reset. NHTSA estimatesthe cost of odometer fraud resulting from lease vehicles to be between$1,272,500,000 and $2,156,560,000. Regulatory Evaluation_Final Rule ImplementingTruth in Mileage Act of 1986. (April 1988; page 79). If requiring long-distancetransferors to keep a copy of the disclosure on the title, including thetransferee's signature, would reduce odometer fraud by less than one-tenthof one percent, it would be cost effective. The purpose of this requirement is to aid investigative action. It is notnow, nor has it ever been, NHTSA's intention to require transferors involvedin long-distance transfers to compare the copy of the returned odometerdisclosure statement with the mileage statement that these transferorshave in their files. We have adopted the second alternative proposed by NAFA and PHH, the suggestionto amend the regulation to specify what constitutes a good faith effortby a transferor to obtain a copy of a completed odometer disclosure statementfrom his transferee. As we noted in the preamble to the final rule of August1988, 15 U.S.C. 1990b provides that NHTSA must take into account the nature,circumstances, extent, and gravity of the violation. Similarly, ``a goodfaith effort'' is dependent upon the circumstances in a particular instance,and we cannot provide a complete listing of these matters. Therefore, itwould be inappropriate to include, in the regulation, a provision as towhat actions constitute good faith. We are proposing to adopt the third alternative suggested by NAFA and PHH,an amendment to the regulation to require transferees to return a completedodometer disclosure statement to their transferors. Specifically, we areproposing to amend andSection; 580.5(f). Under that provision of the finalrule, the transferee is required to sign the disclosure statement and printhis name. This proposal would require that the transferee, in additionto signing the disclosure and printing his name, return a copy of the signeddisclosure statement to his transferor. A transferee who fails to returnthis statement would be subject to civil and criminal penalties. We expectthat this provision will ensure that transferees who obtain the title fromtheir long-distance transferors will return a copy of the completed odometerdisclosure statement to their transferors, and that these long-distancetransferors will be able to retain a copy of the signed odometer disclosurestatement, as required by andSection; 580.8(a). <ITAG tagnum="84">Security of Title Documents</ITAG>The Truth in Mileage Act requires that each State motor vehicle title beset forth by a secure printing process or other secure process, beginningon April 29, 1989. Consistent with this statutory requirements, in a noticepublished in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 17, 1987, 52 FR 27028 (1980), we proposedto add a new section concerning the security of title documents. In additionto proposing that the title be set forth by a secure process, we proposedto require that each reassignment document be set forth by the same secureprocess as the title. To assist the States in their efforts to issue motorvehicle titles that comply with the Truth in Mileage Act and this regulation,we prepared a list of technologies that we proposed to deem a ``secureprocess.'' This list was included in Appendix A. We received several divergent comments concerning the security of the titledocument and Appendix A. To allow for maximum administrative discretionon the part of the States, we did not adopt a suggestion from 3M to listand rank all secure processes. Furthermore, we did not delete AppendixA as suggested by the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators(AAMVA) and several of its member jurisdictions. Rather we expanded andcorrected it. We noted in the preamble to the August 1988 final rule thatAppendix A was included to aid the States in their selection of a secureprocess and in no way limits the States or adds new requirements or restrictionsbeyond those listed in the rule itself. With regard to the document used to reassign the motor vehicle title, AAMVAand several of its member jurisdictions urged the agency to amend the requirementto read, rather than by the ``same'' secure process as the title, by ``a''secure process. Arkansas asserted that it would be a financial burden forthe State to use a reassignment document that incorporates the same secureprocess as the title. Other commenters, including Texas, Vermont, and theArkansas Independent Automobile Dealers Associated, were opposed to therequirement in its entirety, and cited costs burdens. The Wisconsin Departmentof Transportation (Wisconsin), on the other hand, asked that NHTSA eliminateseparate reassignments. In the alternative, Wisconsin suggested that ifreassignments are allowed, NHTSA should require the reassignment documentsto bear control numbers and that the number be included on the title. Wisconsinalso requested that NHTSA require the States to record the control numbersof the reassignment documents they give to each dealer and that each dealerbe required to keep a record of the reassignment document issued for eachvehicle. NHTSA reconsidered it proposed requirement in response to these comments.In the preamble to the August 1988 final rule, we noted that while separatereassignment documents are not mentioned in the Truth in Mileage Act, theyare often an integral part of the transfer process. Since reassignmentdocuments are logical extension of the title, requiring secure reassignmentdocuments is a logical extension of the statutory requirements. Therefore,the final rule required secure reassignment documents. However, ratherthan requiring that reassignment documents be printed by the same secureprocess as the title, we required that the reassignment documents be setforth by ``a secure process.'' We are proposing to amend andSection; 580.4 concerning the security of reassignmentdocuments. Specifically, we are proposing to require that, in additionto being set forth by a secure printing process, reassignment documentsmust be issued by the States. The proposal is consistent with the new lawand our interim rule, published elsewhere in today's <T4>Federal Register,</T4> that requires that secure powers of attorneybe issued by the States. If the States were to only offer guidelines totransferors as to what would constitute a secure reassignment and transferorscould have these reassignment documents printed, unscrupulous transferorscould easily roll back the odometer on a vehicle, discard a reassignmentdocument, and forge a new one with a lower mileage disclosure. Currently,only eleven States allow a vehicle to be transferred on a reassignmentdocument that is not issued by the State. Comments are requested from theStates concerning the issuance and printing of secure reassignments documentsby the State and/or State contractors. <ITAG tagnum="84">Exemptions</ITAG>In the July 1987 NPRM, we proposed a new andSection; 580.6 to exempt certaintransferors from issuing odometer disclosure statements. This new sectionproposed to exempt the same transferors exempted by the current andSection;580.5. NHTSA created these exemptions for transferors of vehicles for whichthe odometer reading is not relied upon as an indicator of vehicle mileageor condition. 47 FR 51885. With one exception, andSection; 580.6 was adoptedas proposed. (Transferors of vehicles ten years old or older, rather thantransferors of vehicles twenty-five years or older, as proposed, are exemptfrom the odometer disclosure requirements of andSection; 580.5.)Since the August 1988 final rule was issued, NHTSA has been asked whethera lessee of a vehicle having a gross vehicle weight rating (GVWR) of morethan 16,000 pounds or of a vehicle that is ten years old or older mustfurnish to his lessor a written statement regarding the vehicle's mileage.Because the lessor, when transferring a vehicle with a GVWR of more than16,000 pounds or a vehicle ten years old or older, is not required to givehis transferee an odometer disclosure statement, we see no reason to requirea lessee of any of these types of vehicles, or of any vehicles that arenot self-propelled, to give their lessor a written statement concerningto vehicle's mileage. Therefore, in this notice, we are proposing to amendandSection; 580.6 to exempt the lessees of certain vehicles from the odometerdisclosure requirements of andSection; 580.7. Likewise, we are proposingto exempt the lessors of certain vehicles from the notification requirementsof andSection; 580.7.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment</ITAG>This action has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that theproposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implications to warrantthe preparation of a Federalism Assessment. While it is estimated thatthis proposed rule would result in additional costs to the States for printingsecure title reassignment documents, the cost to each State is minimal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Impacts</ITAG>A. Costs and Benefits to Dealers, States, and ConsumersNHTSA has analyzed this rule and determined that it is neither ``major''within the meaning of Executive Order 12291, nor ``significant'' withinthe meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policies andprocedures because of the substantial public interest in this matter. ThisNPRM does not result in any costs to the States, dealers, and distributorsin addition to those imposed by the August 1988 final rule. (<T3>See, </T3>Regulatory Evaluation_Final Rule Implementing the Truth inMileage Act. Docket No. 87-09, No. 4). Any interested person may obtaina copy of this regulatory evaluation by writing to NHTSA Docket Section,400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590, or by calling the DocketSection at (202) 366-4949.B. Small Business ImpactsThe agency has also considered the impacts of this rule in relation tothe Regulatory Flexibility Act. I certify that this rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.The final rule of August 1988 requires that reassignments be securely printedor otherwise set forth by a secure process. This proposal merely requiresthat the States issue these documents. At the time the final rule was issued,NHTSA estimated the cost of producing secure reassignments to be $1,730,000to States, dealers, and distributors. NHTSA estimated the costs of controllingreassignment forms to be $1,500,000 to the States. In addition, NHTSA estimatedthe costs of copying and mailing titles containing the odometer disclosureto be $900,000. (<T3>See, </T3>Regulatory Evaluation_Final Rule Implementing the Truth inMileage Act, Docket No. 87-09, No. 4). This proposal would not result inany requirements in addition to those imposed by the August 1988 finalrule. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has been preparedat this time. However, the agency invites comments from small businesseson this issue.C. Environmental ImpactsNHTSA has considered the environmental implications of this rule, in accordancewith the National Environmental Policy Act, and determined that it willnot significantly affect the human environment.D. Paperwork Reduction ActThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has already approved NHTSA'sinformation collection requirements that require consumers, dealers, distributors,lessors, and auction companies to disclose and/or retain odometer disclosureinformation. (OMB 2127-0047). This NPRM does not propose any new informationcollection requirements as that term is defined by OMB in 5 CFR Part 1520.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It isrequested, but not required, that ten copies be submitted.All comments must not exceed fifteen pages in length. (49 CFR 553.21).Necessary attachments may be appended to these submissions without regardto the fifteen page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commentersto detail their preliminary arguments in a concise fashion.All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate listed above will be considered and will be available for examinationin the docket at the above address both before and after that date. Tothe extent possible, comments filed after the closing date will also beconsidered. Comments received too late for consideration will be consideredas suggestions for future rulemaking action. The agency will continue tofile relevant information as it becomes available. It is recommended thatinterested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments bythe docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in the envelopewith their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisorwill return the postcard by mail.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR Part 580 would be amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 580_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
