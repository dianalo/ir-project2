I believe that the use of information technology will increasingly play acrucial role in enabling our- underwriters and brokers to exploit the manyopportunities that will undoubtedly present themselves,&quot; says MurrayLawrence, chairman of the historic Lloyds of London.andM;Others maintain that successful exploitation of information systems isalready a deciding factor in the industry.andP;  &quot;Up until two years ago, fewcompanies had a business strategy that linked with IT; most companies hadfairly reactive strategies.andP;  Now you can't tell the difference betweenbusiness and IT strategies,&quot; says Jeff Watkins, a researcher in managementstudies at Bristol University in Britain, who has just completed a study ofthe use of IS in the British insurance industry.andM;Watkins maintains that up until now some of the mo successful insurancecompanies have had miserably inadequate is strategies, with computer powerbeing confined to administrative tasks.andP;  That is changing, he claims, as somecompanies begin to invest heavily in  competitive edge&quot; systems.andP;  Thesesystems often link salespeople's portable PCs to client databases or delivercomparative information about a variety of insurance policies from a numberof companies via electronic data interchange (EDI) networks.andP;  &quot;Over the nextthree to four years, we will see a division between leading edge companiesand those who have lagged on technology,&quot; he says.andP;  Big Bucks for ISandM;The cost of entering the technology is not cheap.andP;  One network, based inBrussels, Belgium, the European Reinsurance and Insurance Network (RINET),which delivers an EDI service across the Continent, charges a one-timemembership fee that works out to around $425,000 per company.andP;  But majorplayers in the insurance industry have deep pockets.andP;  is spending in thosecompanies is currently running at around 2% of their annual gross premiumincome, Watkins estimates.andP;  That gross income ranges within Europe's top 10from the $6 billion at the U.K.'s Sun Alliance up to the $16 billion at WestGermany's Allianz.andM;Some companies whose pockets are not quite that deep are merging with otherinsurance industry players to give themselves greater is investment clout.andO;&quot;Companies are launching takeover bids like fury as [investing in] IT becomesincreasingly important in selling policies,&quot; says Bob Carter, professor ofinsurance at Nottingham University in Britain.andM;No one can afford to take any chances when it comes to meeting the challengeof panEuropean marketing and administration.andP;  The European Commission isbeginning to create a single insurance market in Europe out of the wildlydiffering national markets.andP;  This involves sweeping away the regulatorycobwebs in each country that snare foreign insurance companies.andP;  So far, forexample, the commission has eliminated prohibitions ?n European insurancecompanies wishing to set up branches in neighboring countries.andP;  The next stepfor the commission is to make it possible for companies to trade acrossborders without necessarily having offices in both countries.andP;  The commissionis also trying to step up the pace of is innovation aimed at contributing toa pan-European insurance market.andP;  As part of its Research in AdvancedCommunications in Europe (RACE) program, the commission is paying for thedevelopment of a standard electronic case-handling system.andP;  The RACE projectinvolves six collaborators, headed by Philips International, a Dutchinsurance company.andP;  The partners are working on a system that will support 10to 15 insurance employees working on distributed workstaiion's via broadbandfiber optic cable.andP;  The workstations, equipped with graphical user interfacesdisplayed on high-definition monitors, will deliver data, images and voice *ONE INSURANCE EDI NETWORK CHARGES EACH COMPANY  4259000 PER YEAR.andP;  relatingto all aspects of insurance policy administration over Internet and FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) local area networks.andP;  Custom-built softwarefor the project will facilitate program-to-program communications and provideprocedures and guidelines that will help case workers handle their files moreeffectively.andP;  Passports to Profits The European insurance business is dividedinto three distinct sectors: life, non-life and reinsurance.andP;  Life includessavings, pensions, health insurance and normal life insurance coverage.andO;Nonlife (property and casualty insurance in the United States) includesindividual and corporate coverage coverage for houses, cars and factories, aswell as liability insurance for damage that a policyholder might cause.andO;Reinsurance is essentially the insurance that insurance companies take out toprotect themselves from claims.andM;Whatever the insurance sector, much remains to be done before Europeaninsurance companies can reach the goal of having a single European passport,&quot; as the concept of being able to sell a single insurance policy ina unified market is called.andP;  They will have to simplify their products, sortout currency differences and find new ways to distribute their wares, saysErnest Morris, group general manager for management services at ThePrudential, Europe's third largest insurance company.andP;  &quot;In the insurancebusiness, there is a hell of a long way to so before there is a singlemarket: 1992 is a concept, not a date.andP;  My impression is that those companiesthat do have operations in several countries arrange IT on acountry-to-country basis,&quot; says Morris.andM;These companies will need to broaden their internal corporate is strategiesto include a range of business partners, asserts Bristol University'sWatkins.andP;  Such industry-wide is strategies will enable insurers to capitalizeon their systems by making it easier to deal electronically with externalsates outlets, such as banks.andM;Insurance companies of all stripes are finding that networking is a morecost-effective way of reaching their sales outlets and, ultimately,customers.andP;  This is no surprise, since their highest cost, after the moneythey pay out in claims, is the cost of sales.andP;  In Britain, for example, eachf I a salesperson collects in commission from the company for the sate of apolicy yields a measly 50 pence for the shareholders over the entire life ofthe policy, according to The Economist magazine.andP;  The U.K.andP;  alone has fournetworks that feature specialized services solely for retailers of life andnonlife insurance.andP;  Run by British Telecommunications PLC, Digital EquipmentCorp., IBM and the ATandamp;T-owned Istel Ltd., respectively, these value-addedservices pump information from U.K.andP;  insurance companies to more than 30,000retail outlets, reducing administrative costs for the insurers.andP;  Rather thanhaving to contact a number of insurance company employees in differentdepartments to get information, the brokers and financial institutions thataccess these networks from PCs or videotex terminals can compare contracts,inspect premium rates, receive advice and exchange basic policy details usingdata from mainframes operated by the country's insurance companies.andM;Still, to get the most out of such new technologies, is will have to do abetter * OUR MAJOR SYSTEMS THRUST IS BETTER IT SUPPORT FOR THE SALES FORCE.andO;job of selling itself, both internally and externally, some surveys indicate.andO;The surveys show that not all of the industry is sold on informationtechnology.andP;  A survey carried out by Meridian Computer Services  (MCS), aLondon-based software company serving the insurance business, found that manyretailers were ignorant of the networks.andP;  Some 80% of brokers were undecidedabout which one to use or had not even heard of their existence, according toMCS.andM;Other reports have questioned the quality of information management in theinsurance industry.andP;  Jeremy Dickson, a partner at Coopers andamp; Lybrand Deloitte,a U.K.andP;  accounting firm, claims that many companies are operating 10- or20-year-old systems and are postponing upgrades because of the time and costinvolved.andM;But insurance company executives cannot be entirely blamed for failing tocome to terms with IS, according to a second survey.andP;  A study by KPMG PeatMarwick McLintock found that an average of $6,000 was spent per employee eachyear on is at the top 50 U. K. insurance companies.andP;  But  hardly any&quot; of thatmoney was spent on educating management about is.andP;  Combating TechnophobiaandM;Indeed, the trend toward end user computing has yet to result in a comparabledistribution of is skills, says Vernon Bryce, human resources group managerat Peat Marwick.andP;  &quot;Management in insurance operates in a very traditional,hierarchical way.andP;  But IS is requiring them to manage in a different way thatfits the new market requirement mentality,&quot; Bryce observes.andM;Management technophobia is not distributed equally throughout the insuranceindustry and is less of a problem in the reinsurance sector.andP;  Of the 80companies that applied earlier this year for services from the RINET network,45  were reinsurers, 29 were insurers and six were brokers.andP;  Xavier Dereppe,RINET's * THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO BEFORE THERE'S A SINGLE INSURANCE MARKET.andO;general manager, was optimistic that the service will win friends as it comeson line this year.andP;  RINET is aiming for more than 200 corporate users thatwill exchange electronic mail messages and transfer files via host systems orPCs.andM;Companies in the life insurance sector, which rely on salesmanship and acompetitive price to succeed, have tended to lead in is applications.andP;  Overhalf the life companies in Britain, for example, have installed a myriad ofnew applications software in the last couple of years, well ahead of theother sectors of the industry.andP;  &quot;The major part of our systems thrust isimproving the IT support to our sales force,&quot; says Morris of The Prudential.andO;The trend in the company is toward client-based databases; that is, databasesarranged around customers' names rather than around the company's varioustypes of policies.andM;The Prudential sales force works from home, using handheld machines that canupload and access the data from branch systems, Morris says.andP;  The handheldmachines play a vital part in what The Prudential calls &quot;front-roomsalesmanship,&quot; allowing salespeople to perform instant calculations showingpotential customers the policy options open to them.andM;Morris sees is supporting three key elements of the insurance business: theproduct, its administration and its distribution.andP;  &quot;We are trying to make itmuch easier to make the changes in administration that result from changes ina product.andP;  The key thing in administration is cost reduction, which we cancope with,&quot; he explains.andP;  &quot;But in distribution there is a certain amount offerment: VANS [value-added network services] and EDI are causing people tolook at their systems [differently].andP;  Data communications mean you have toenter a new world in terms  of system availability and screen layouts.&quot;andM;Image processing, too, is a key technology for  the future of the insuranceindustry, and one that is high on the list of vendors such as IBM.andP;  Effortsto cut down on paperwork will benefit more than just the bottom line, saysIBM's insurance industry director for Europe, Peter Salinson.andP;  Europeconsumes 40 million trees per year just to fuel its insurance business.andM;IBM is also working on expert systems to aid underwriters, but its mainthrust is in developing a standard set of industry data structures based onits Systems Application Architecture (SAA).andP;  The structures would allowcustomer data to be processed with more consistency.andP;  &quot;One of the problemsthe [insurance] industry has is how to protect its investment [in clientdata].andP;  Information  on a customer will often be held in eight or 10different places,&quot; says Salinson.andM;In Europe, the insurance industry is beginning to realize that it can nolonger relegate information technology to administrative back room functions.andO;As Salinson says: &quot;The question is how the industry is going, to attractcustomers and get away from their old applications and to plug in new ones.&quot;andO;Indeed, it is clear that being able to increase market share and engenderstaunch customer loyalty will more and more depend on an insurer's aggressiveuse of IS.andP;  john Lamb is editor of Computer Weekly in Sutton, Surrey, U.K.andO;!!!
