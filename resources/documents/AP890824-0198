Re-assembled, it would look like a huge vampire bat or astub-tailed manta ray. Underlying its design was the notion that theenemy wouldn't see it at all, because this jet-powered flying wing'sskin would be made of composite materials to absorb radar waves,rather than reflect them.   No, the Northrop B-2 bomber, the world's most expensive airplane,hasn't already become a dust-gathering relic _ although somecritics, convinced the albatross is the only sea-creature to whichit should be compared, wish that were so.   The astonishing lookalike in Silver Hill is indeed a stealthwarplane, but it was secretly built and test-flown 45 years ago byNazi Germany.   For all the fanfare surrounding the use of the word ``stealth''since it was introduced to the U.S. military vocabulary in 1980, theB-2 and such radar-evading relatives as the F-117A fighter representconcepts which, by aviation standards, are almost ancient.   The B-2 has been financed, until this year, out of the Pentagon'smysterious ``black'' budget. For eight years, the taxpayers spent$22.4 billion without knowing it, and without knowing what they weregetting for it.   What they got, when it was finally nosed heavenward in July, wasa strange, plastic bird that carries a smaller payload and probablywon't fly much higher, much farther or any faster than the StrategicAir Command's old reliable, the B-52.   The B-2 is 17 feet tall, 69 feet long and has a wingspan of 172feet. It is powered by four General Electric F-118 engines,virtually the same engines as used on the F-14 fighter but withoutafterburners. Its range is 6,900 miles without refueling, and 11,500miles with one midair refueling. It will have a maximum takeoffweight of 350,000 pounds and be able to carry up to 50,000 pounds ofbombs or missiles, nuclear or conventional, 10,000 pounds less thanthe B-52. Private experts estimate it will fly at altitudes of up to55,000 feet at cruising speeds of mach 0.8 to 0.85, or about 530-560mph.   There's nothing especially dazzling about any of those numbers.What is dazzling, presumably, is the stuff the Air Force won't talkabout _ the stealth technology, computerized flight controls,``quiet'' on-board radar, and other electronic systems, possiblyemploying fiber optics, designed to withstand the electromagneticinterference generated by nuclear blasts.   The Air Force wants to spend an additional $50 billion or so toproduce 132 of the planes designed by a company, Northrop, which foryears hadn't made a warplane other than a lightweight fighter, theF-5.   Former Pentagon procurement chief Robert B. Costello, who left asundersecretary of defense in May, wanted to scuttle the program. Inan interview with The Washington Post, he said he told then-DefenseSecretary Frank Carlucci last year that ``it's being brought to youby the same company that brought you'' a series of troubledprograms, including guidance systems for the MX and air-launchedcruise missiles. ``What makes you think they'll do better (with theB-2)?''   Eight days after the B-2's maiden flight July 17, Pentagon andcongressional officials confirmed an investigation was under way bythe Justice Department's fraud unit concerning Northrop's billingpractices on the project. The company said it was unaware of theprobe.   Northrop Chairman Thomas V. Jones says without reservation thatthe B-2 is an ``extraordinary'' success. Defense Secretary RichardB. Cheney calls it ``absolutely vital'' to strategic deterrence.President Bush says doing without it would be ``devastating'' toarms-control negotiations with the Soviets.   The security and secrecy surrounding the project have beenphenomenal, perhaps rivaled only by elements of the Star Warsprogram and the Manhattan Project that developed the atomic bomb inWorld War II. Northrop removed it from the rest of its ownorganization, forming a new division called Advanced Products andhousing it at a closed auto plant in Pico Rivera, Calif. Itsurrounded the plant, as well as the sister assembly complex atPalmdale, Calif., with fences topped by razor wire.   According to Costello, security has accounted for 5 percent ofthe costs to date. With more than $22.4 billion spent so far, thatamounts to more than $1 billion.   The tight security imposed additional costs. Efficiency sufferedfrom compartmentalization so severe some supervisors didn't knowwhat their subordinates were doing. ``I couldn't even ask,'' oneformer Northrop official told the Los Angeles Times last year. ``Forall I knew, they were going to the movies every day.''   Some could have. When employees were hired, they could not godirectly to work until their security clearances were finished. Manywere assigned for weeks to make-work jobs in an area of the plantthey nicknamed the ``drunk tank.''   Unbeknownst to the public, the biggest snag occurred halfwaythrough the seven-year design period when the Air Force changed itsmind about the B-2's mission. The Pentagon originally ordered ahigh-altitude bomber. Now it wanted one that could penetrate at lowlevels as well, probably because it was fearful the Soviet Union wasdeveloping the same new radar technology, called OTHB for Over theHorizon Backscatter. The still super-secret radar system, thePentagon has privately acknowledged, offers new possibilities fordetecting stealth airplanes, though it is said to be ineffectivewithin 500 miles.   Northrop's designers redesigned the wing for flight at loweraltitudes, where turbulence is greater. That took a year and another$1 billion. An additional six-month delay was necessary for otherdesign changes, related especially to the engine inlets. In 1987,two years before Congress began public debate over funding for theB-2, the Pentagon moved its production schedule back two more yearsin the face of Gramm-Rudman budget restrictions. Cheney haspostponed production yet another year; the Pentagon now hopes tobuild all 132 planes by 1999, versus the original target of 1995.  </TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
