It should also function asa universal splice joining multimode fibers of single-mode fibersand accommodating all combinations of 250-micron coated fiber and900-micron buffered fiber.andP;  Bell's new CSL Light Splice Systemdoes these things and more.andP;  It also features a lens molded intothe splice's housing so that technicians can see inside it.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   AT and T Network Systems (innovations)AT and T Bell Laboratories Inc.
