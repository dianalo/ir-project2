The FDIC is seeking at least $200 million in damages from67 former officers and directors of First RepublicBank'sfailed banks in Dallas and Houston, according to the suitsfiled last week in federal court in each city. The defendantsinclude some of Texas' best-known business executives.</LP><TEXT>   The suits accuse the former bank directors of failing tosupervise and curb the units' lending, which was heavilyconcentrated in the oil industry and commercial real estate.The directors of the Dallas bank are more specificallyaccused of failing to keep senior executives from pressuringthe bank's loan officers and appraisers to make &quot;improperloans&quot; and &quot;inaccurate appraisals of collateral.&quot;   Loan losses led to the collapse of First RepublicBank'sunits three years ago in what is still the costliest U.S.bank failure in history, with an estimated price tag of $2.94billion. First RepublicBank, which isn't related to FirstRepublic Bancorp of San Francisco, collapsed one year afterthe holding company was created in the merger of RepublicBankCorp. and InterFirst Corp. Most of the defendants in thesuits were also directors of RepublicBank.   Any damages awarded the FDIC in the suits may be comingfrom the defendants' own pockets. The banks' insurancepolicies for officers and directors have been virtuallyexhausted by at least $19.5 million in settlements in theholding company's bankruptcy case, which was filed shortlyafter the FDIC seized the company's bank units. In addition,most insurance policies for directors and officers of banksand thrifts specifically bar coverage of claims brought byfederal regulators, a rider that has been upheld by severalcourts.   Among the former directors named in the suits are J.McDonald Williams, managing partner of Trammell Crow Co.;George W. Strake, former chairman of the Texas Republicanparty; Jerry R. Junkins, chairman and chief executive officerof Texas Instruments Inc.; and Robert H. Dedman, chairman andchief executive officer of Club Corp. International. Mr.Williams was on vacation and couldn't be reached for comment.Mr. Strake declined to comment. Messrs. Junkins and Dedmandidn't return calls for comment.   Another former bank director and defendant, Paul R.Seegers, said the suits showed &quot;big government at its worst,trying to harass and bleed substantial sums out of directorsthat have tried to do a good job.&quot;   &quot;It's based on the zeal of the regulators and nothingelse,&quot; said Mr. Seegers, who retired earlier this month aschairman of Centex Corp. &quot;I'm just wondering how they're evergoing to get bank directors in the future.&quot;   Also among the defendants are two former FirstRepublicBank directors who joined NCNB Corp. when thatcompany bought the First RepublicBank's failed units in July1988. Joseph P. Musolino is now vice chairman of NCNB TexasNational Bank, and James R. Erwin is now president of theNCNB Texas unit in charge of liquidating the old FirstRepublicBank loans. NCNB said it wouldn't comment on thesuit.   Mr. Seegers said he was surprised that InterFirstofficials weren't sued, too. &quot;There were a hell of a lot ofbad loans at InterFirst as well as Republic,&quot; he said.   But an FDIC spokeswoman indicated that InterFirst's formerofficers and directors may escape being sued by the FDIC. Thethree-year statute of limitations for filing suits fordamages lapses today.   &quot;We did look at InterFirst, but we felt the likelihood ofrecovery and the factors that were cited in the two suitsfiled were more closely related to the directors and officersat First Republic,&quot; the spokeswoman said. &quot;We're looking tosee where we've got the best opportunity&quot; for recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
