It was a victoryconceived and executed by a government agency, the DefenseDepartment. The leading figures are old bureaucrats, RichardCheney, Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf. Their combinedannual salary is less than one-thousandth of Michael Milken'sin his best year. Two of the three got their advancedtraining in the government. I don't think that any one ofthem ever met a payroll, to recall a test from my youth. Thesubordinate actors were also government bureaucrats. None ofthem got profit-sharing or stock options. They were all partof a system that bought $600 toilet-seat covers and armoredpersonnel carriers that capsized in two inches of water.   What are we to make of that? Not too much, surely. Butsomething. It does not mean that the Defense Department canor should do everything, or that bureaucrats more generallycan or should do everything. But the time is ripe forrethinking attitudes toward the administrative agencies ofgovernment and the career employees of government.</LP><TEXT>   Perhaps for a time we will not hear Ronald Reagan'sfavorite story about the clerk in the Bureau of IndianAffairs who was seen to be weeping bitterly and explained itwas because his Indian had died. That clerk has hiscounterpart in the Defense Department shuffling the paperwork for the production of the Patriot missile, the driver ofthe tank-truck that supplies tanks, and the man inside thetank.   Perhaps for a time we will not hear as a presumed stopperto any argument about any possible government functions, &quot;Doyou want it performed by the same people who run the PostOffice?&quot; -- as if that proved that government operations areipso facto inefficient and ineffective. Now we have seen agovernment operation that was efficient and effective.   One may say that the analogy is inappropriate, and thatthe military departments are fundamentally different from thecivilian ones. But people do not become efficient andinnovative by putting on government-issue clothing. We surelythought that the cliche characteristics of bureaucratsapplied to the Defense Department when it bought the $600toilet-seat covers. And we thought it was just anotherexample of bureaucratic ineptitude when, during the invasionof Grenada, the Navy and the Air Force had to communicatewith each other by a credit card phone call throughBaltimore. If the test of bureaucracy is distance from theprofit motive, the military forces qualify.   How did this bureaucratic government agency perform sowell? One explanation is that a lot of money was spent on it.The Gulf War is the answer to the proposition that you can'tsolve problems by throwing money at them. It proved Stein'sLaw, that if an agency wastes one-fourth of its budget youshould give it one-third more money than it would need if itwere optimally efficient. Or, if 30% of the bombs hit theirtarget, as has been said about the Gulf War, you have to drop3 1/3 times as many bombs -- as we did.   The &quot;incremental&quot; cost of the war was small, possibly inthe range of $50 billion. But the incremental cost was smallbecause from 1981 to 1990 we had spent $2.8 trillion (1990prices) in training forces and developing and acquiringequipment. This expenditure was not mainly for fighting Iraq.It was for deterring the U.S.S.R. and for meetingcontingencies, of which Iraq turned out to be one. When thecontingency arrived, the resources to meet it were ample.   Much has been said about the &quot;smart weapons&quot; the U.S.employed in the Gulf. But the smartest weapon turned out tobe the Reagan defense budgets. What was smart was therecognition that for a country with a gross national productof $5 trillion, $300 billion is not too much to spend indefense of vital interests, or even in reducing the risks andcasualties of that defense. Many thought the spending wasexcessive when it was made. Few will now say they would havepreferred less defense spending in the 1980s and morecasualties in the Gulf.   We have learned something about waste. I was a member ofthe Packard Commission in 1985-86, and I have heard a lotabout waste in the Defense Department. But I now have towonder whether there is not a basic conflict between economyin the small and effectiveness in the large. Would aninstitution so organized and so motivated that it neverbought a $600 toilet-seat cover be sufficiently audacious andimaginative to fight a successful war? Or, to change thevenue, would a system so organized and circumscribed that itnever paid money to Mr. Reagan's favorite welfare queen everdo much good for many people?   People will say that warfare is a unique problem, unlikepoverty or education or crime, so that although a governmentagency may be excellent at warfare no government agency cancontribute much to the solution of the other problems. Theythink of warfare as a linear problem, with known, or at leastknowable, quantitative relations between inputs and outputs,so that a good mathematician could figure out the optimumstrategy.   Anyone who believes that has not read &quot;War and Peace.&quot; Waris an intensely human activity. It requires therecruitment,training and motivation of large numbers ofpeople, the reconciliation of many conflicting interests, andexcruciatingly difficult choices, involving life or death forthousands of people. It is conducted in an atmosphere ofuncertainty and ignorance and requires constant adaptation tounforeseen developments.   War is not just like other problems. But it hassimilarities to other problems. In a recent op-ed article inthe New York Times, sociologist Daniel Bell points out,correctly, that &quot;waging war is not like fixing schools.&quot; Hegives an example of a problem in the field of education thatwould not yield to the techniques that succeed in war,&quot;Should schools teach tradition or great books ormulticultural schemes?&quot; But the question &quot;Does c-a-t spellcat, and should every six-year-old know that, and how do weget them to know that?&quot; might be one that would yield to theapplication of money and intelligence through a governmentagency.   Our other problems do have many differences from themilitary problem. One of them is surely that they have neverbeen elevated to the level of national will and attentionthat the war had. When speaking of the nation's problems inhis inaugural address two years ago, Mr. Bush said, &quot;We havemore will than wallet.&quot; He emphasized the limits to whatcould be done. But when he spoke of the invasion of Kuwait hesaid, &quot;This will not stand.&quot; There was no reference tolimits. He did not say, &quot;This will not stand if we can undoit within the limits of existing appropriations.&quot; He saidthat there would not be another Vietnam. He has never saidthat there would not be another failed war on illiteracy orpoverty.   Before Iraq there was a widespread feeling of theincompetence of our military forces, going back to Vietnam,the Iranian rescue attempt, Lebanon and Grenada. We havelearned that this impression was mistaken, or that the causesof it have been correctable. We should be considering whethersimilar impressions of the ineptitude of government in otherfields are mistaken, or the reasons correctible, and whetherother great national enterprises could be successfullypursued if backed by sufficient will.   My dream is to see the undersecretary of education hold adaily briefing on the war on ignorance. He would stand beforea blackboard and say: &quot;Yesterday, 35,471 children learnedthat c-a-t spells cat. But 64,283 did not learn it. We willgo back to them tomorrow.&quot;   ---   A former chairman of the president's Council of EconomicAdvisers, Mr. Stein is an American Enterprise Institutefellow.</TEXT></DOC>
