<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-1069 </DOCNO><TEXT>Like many other utilities nationwide, the Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation(Niagara Mohawk) is showing increasing interest in integrated least-costplanning - defined here as the planning process needed to determine themix of demand- and supply-side options that would deliver a given energyservice at the lowest cost. (The evaluation of cost should also incorporaterisk and uncertainty but a discussion of these issues is beyond the scopeof this paper.) We have developed a research and assessment strategyin our approach to demand-side planning for two reasons. First, we believethat a substantial amount of research and assessment is required beforedemand-side programs can be accepted with the same level of confidenceas traditional supply technologies. Second, we expect to have ample capacitythrough the end of the century, and thus, have the time to conduct themulti-year experiments needed to resolve key uncertainties. The paperdescribes the analytical design of demand-side planning activities atNiagara Mohawk. It begins with a conceptual overview of integrated planning,and then describes the research we have underway to assess demand-sideprograms.</TEXT></DOC>
