Manuel Antonio Noriega and he promised additionaleconomic measures will be taken against that country.   At the State Department, spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler called theappointment of the new government by Panama's Council of State ``athinly disguised coup d'etat.'' She dismissed the new unelectedpresident as the ``latest puppet'' of Noriega.   The United States has recognized as the legitimate authority inPanama President Eric Arturo Delvalle, who was ousted by Noriega'sallies in February 1988. But Delvalle's term in office would haveended Friday, and the administration ceased recognizing him asPanama's constitutional leader.   The U.S. Embassy in Panama continues to function but Bush madeclear in his statement that ``we will not have any diplomaticcontact with the Noriega regime.''   U.S. Ambassador Arthur Davis, who was withdrawn from Panama inMay, will not return, Bush said.   ``This should have been a proud day for Panamanians and for allwho believe in self-determination and democracy,'' Bush said.   ``Instead, it is a sad day _ a sad day for Panama and for thedemocratic nations of this hemisphere.''   In effect, little changed with Friday's statements since theUnited States has had no official dealings with the Noriega-ledgoverment for 18 months and no change is contemplated for the newteam he has assembled.   As for Delvalle, he has spent much of that time in hiding andwielded no power.   Still, the administration used the occasion of the appointment ofa new leadership in Panama to intensify its campaign against Noriega.   ``Noriega's naming of a so-called `provisional government' iscompletely outside Panama's constitution, and is, in effect, athinly disguised coup d'etat,'' Ms. Tutwiler said. ``Noriega's is anoutlaw regime.''   She spoke disdainfully of the figurehead president, FranciscoRodriguez, who was named to replace outgoing President Manuel SolisPalma.   ``Noriega's latest puppet president is an unknown within Panamawith no political following, whose chief qualification for theposition seems to have been his long-time friendship with Noriega,and his slavish loyalty to the dictator,'' Ms. Tutwiler said.   Diplomatic hostility to Panama, she said, is being reflected inthe decision of a number of countries, including Venezuela, Peru,Uruguay, Colombia, Brazil, Chile and Argentina, to withdraw theirambassadors from Panama City.   Bush said that the administration will ``continue to take othersteps ... to deprive the illegal regime of funds that belong to thePanamanian people.'' He did not elaborate.   Early last year, the United States began withholding from Panamarevenues payable to that country for Panama Canal operations. Amongother actions, trade sanctions were imposed and Panamanian assets inthe United States were frozen. The amount of frozen assets is in the$300 million range.   Officials said privately a number of options are being consideredfor further tightening of the exisiting sanctions but they gave noadditional details.   An elected president was to have been sworn in Friday in Panamabut authorities there voided the May 7 elections after independentobservers concluded that the anti-Noriega candidate had won in alandslide.   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft, talking to reporterswho accompanied Bush on an Air Force One flight back toKennebunkport, Maine Friday, said the United States is ``rethinkingall aspects of our relationship with Panama,'' including U.S.posture on the Panama Canal treaties and further economic sanctions.   ``There could be other steps including economic,'' he toldreporters, but he declined to discuss what they might be.   Asked if he had run out of options and why the United States hadnot taken further steps before now, he said, ``because we didn'twant to increase the suffering of the Panamanian people.''   Regarding the canal, Scowcroft said the choices were to abide bythe treaties, suspend them or abrogate them, but said there are noplans to take action at this time.   He said the exercises by U.S. troops in Panama will continue,``to keep our troops alert ... to the extent we may have to defendthe Panama Canal against whatever.''</TEXT></DOC>
