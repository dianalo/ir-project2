Sperm analysis should help the search for disease-causing genes,while single-cell studies might allow diagnosis of genetic diseasesin an embryo soon after test-tube fertilization, researchers said.   The early diagnosis would allow a decision on whether to implantthe embryo in the mother, researcher Norman Arnheim of theUniversity of Southern California in Los Angeles said Wednesday ina telephone interview.   Sperm analysis should also help police implicate or exclude rapesuspects, he said.   Arnheim and graduate student Honghua Li report the work withother scientists at the university and Cetus Corp. in Emeryville,Calif., in today's issue of the British journal Nature.   They used a technique called polymerase chain reaction thatcreates millions of copies of a minute amount of genetic material,accumulating enough for genetic analysis.   In one series of experiments, they were able to detect which oftwo variants of a gene was present in 43 of 80 sperm analyzed. Inanother series, they were able to identify variants in two genessimultaneously in 70 of 114 sperm analyzed.   Such analysis should help scientists find disease-causing genes,Arnheim said.   Genes lie along string-like structures called chromosomes. Tofind particular genes, scientists use markers, which are bits ofgenetic material at known locations along the same chromosome asthe gene they are seeking. They close in on the gene by discoveringcloser and closer markers.   When scientists have to determine the order in which markers liealong a chromosome, they must study chromosomes from many membersof a family. But sperm from an individual can provide a far largernumber of appropriate chromosomes for analysis, letting scientistsfind the order of very closely spaced markers, Arnheim said.</TEXT></DOC>
