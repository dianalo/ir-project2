Cecil Andrus said he acted in theinterests of national security when he partially lifted a ban on theshipments of nuclear waste into the state.   But anti-nuclear activists said the issue is not nationalsecurity, but a burgeoning radioactive waste supply with no place togo.   Andrus announced Thursday that he will allow temporary shipmentsof transuranic and low-level radioactive waste into the state. Theshipments are to come only from the U.S. Department of Energy'sRocky Flats nuclear weapons plant in Colorado, and only for the nextsix months.   The governor said two railroad boxcars per month will be acceptedfrom the Rocky Flats site near Denver to avoid a ``serious nationalsecurity crisis'' if the facility closed down.   An average of four boxcars per month were shipped from theColorado plant to the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory beforeAndrus closed Idaho's borders to waste shipments last Oct. 19.   Partially lifting the ban on new shipments will allow Rocky Flatsto remain open and give the DOE time to clear up problems that havedelayed opening of its Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, a permanentwaste storage site near Carlsbad, N.M.   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, and Rep. Richard Stallings, D-Idaho,both supported Andrus' decision. McClure called it ``recognition ofthe fact that this is a national issue that has clear and seriousimplications for our deterrent forces.''   But Elizabeth Paul, the executive director of the anti-nuclearSnake River Alliance, criticized the governor for softening hisstance since January, when he said the DOE should stop producingweapons if it cannot come up with long-term waste solutions.   Ms. Paul said there is ``no reasonable evidence'' that shuttingdown Rocky Flats would jeopardize national security.   Another Snake River board member, Fritz Bjornsen, agreed, saying,``The crisis is in radioactive waste management, not nationalsecurity.''</TEXT></DOC>
