As a result, said Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah, the oil minister of Kuwait, &quot;I would hope oil prices will not decline significantly.&quot;    The oil markets remained skeptical, however, with prices tumbling for the second day in a row. The price of crude oil futures went below $17 a barrel for the first time since March.    Now that the backroom bickering and political maneuvering are over, the future course of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries lies in the oil fields back home. After six days of meetings, the OPEC ministers signed a pact around midnight Monday that does no more than preserve current production quotas in hopes of maintaining the cartel's benchmark price of $18 a barrel at a time of weak oil markets. Several signed the agreement knowing they were far from compliance with it.    Kuwait's Sheik Ali, for instance, confirmed yesterday that Kuwait's production is 100,000 to 150,000 barrels a day above its quota. But Sheik Ali joined a number of the other ministers in pledging not only to open their borders and production records to outside inspection but also to stop discounting from OPEC's official prices.    &quot;We are hopeful right now that we all (will) make the necessary political as well as administrative commitments to adhere to the production levels that have been assigned to all of us,&quot; said Hisham M. Nazer, the oil minister of Saudi Arabia, &quot;and also to adhere to the price and refrain from giving either direct discounts or indirect discounts of whatever nature.&quot;    The chief enforcer of the agreement -- Alhaji Rilwanu Lukman, the president of OPEC and the oil minister of Nigeria -- vowed to keep a close watch, with the help of a Dutch auditing team. &quot;If we have evidence of flagrant cheating,&quot; Mr. Lukman declared in an interview, &quot;we would in fact call immediately for an emergency meeting.&quot;    With Persian Gulf tensions running high because of the Iran-Iraq war, the OPEC ministers spent much of their six days trying to balance the divergent objectives of Iran and an Arab Gulf group that supports Iraq. With world petroleum inventories brimming and a global recession possible, oil market analysts had said that only a steep slash in OPEC's production of 18.5 million barrels a day could prevent a possible price collapse.    To bring production in line with the most widely accepted forecasts of demand for OPEC oil, the cartel must make at least one million barrels of daily oil output disappear by early next year. Otherwise, nervous, overstocked refiners could begin dumping their oil.    But the ministers simply continued their current production ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day, except that Iraq, the most flagrant violator, was excluded from the agreement. A Saudi-backed plan to bring Iraq into compliance by increasing its official quota to the same level as Iran's was too much to accomplish in the rarefied political environment. Thus, outside the agreement, Iraq is now free to produce as many as 600,000 barrels a day more than if it had received a quota equal to Iran's, Mr. Nazer estimates.    The communique haggled over by the ministers left the new, official ceiling at 15.1 million barrels a day, not including the old quota of Iraq, which claims to be producing 2.8 million a day.    Also left outside of the agreement is nearly 400,000 barrels a day from the so-called Neutral Zone, shared equally by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. It isn't counted because it is produced as &quot;war relief&quot; crude for Iraq. According to Sheik Ali, if Iraq had remained a part of the agreement, that amount of production essentially would have been taken off the market because it would have been counted as part of Iraq's quota.    It remains to be seen whether another chronic quota violator, the United Arab Emirates, will do its part to shrink excess production; the Emirates have been producing nearly double their quota of 948,000 barrels a day. By most accounts, their oil minister, Mana Saeed Otaiba, received a tongue-lashing from one minister after another and was usually seen walking here with a somber expression.    &quot;I felt sorry for Manny, actually,&quot; said Mr. Lukman, the OPEC president. &quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;we can't accept that any member country should violate the quota with impunity.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
