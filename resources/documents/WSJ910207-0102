Grousingby some has been reported in various journals over thealleged suppression of conservation and renewable energyinitiatives in the NES, to be displaced entirely, accordingto one report, by things that &quot;real men&quot; do: build dams,drill wells and construct nuclear power plants.   Not surprisingly, some partisan on the &quot;other&quot; side hasventured forth with a counterleak. What is a littlesurprising is that the Journal has permitted itself to beused in this fashion (&quot;Admiral Synfuels?&quot; Review andamp; Outlook,Jan. 16). Invoking luridly the ghost of policy past -- theSynfuels debacle -- you uncharacteristically join those whowould become the Hansard's (official record of theproceedings of the British Parliament) of Washington leaks.</LP><TEXT>   You correctly observe that oil markets have settled sinceIraq seized Kuwait last August. What you omit is mention ofthe array of quiet but persistent efforts -- ranging fromsuccessful test deployment of the Strategic Petroleum Reserveto securing commitments from oil-producing governments tomake up lost production -- done to contribute to the market'sability to adjust smoothly to that event. These are not thesteps of a department -- let alone an admiral -- prone to&quot;regulatory lunacy.&quot;   The Department of Energy will continue to adhere to thequaint view that it is the president's prerogative toannounce what his energy policy is and is not. When thatoccurs, the proposals may be evaluated in their entirety. Inthe meantime it will suffice to paraphrase Mark Twain'sadvice to the Associated Press by observing that your reportof the death of free-market energy policies at the hands ofAdmiral Watkins has been greatly exaggerated.
