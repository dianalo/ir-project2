About a dozen big U.S. banks boosted their prime rates by a halfpercentage point to 9 percent _ the first increase in the primesince just before October's stock market collapse.   Market analysts point out that hauntingly similar jitters aboutrising interest rates were a big factor behind the Oct. 19 crash,and those memories are still fresh in the minds of nervousinvestors.   ``The major problem with the stock market has been the rise inrates,'' said Larry Wachtel, an analyst for Prudential-BacheSecurities Inc.   Chase Manhattan Bank was the first big bank to raise the keyrate, which is watched closely because bankers use it as a baserate for loans to many businesses and for consumer loans, includingmortgages. Chase's move was announced around noon today after WallStreet had already sustained sharp losses on interest-rate fears.   ``It tends to reduce confidence in the stock market,'' said HughJohnson, senior vice president of First Albany Corp. in Albany,N.Y., referring to the increase in the prime rate.   The hike in the prime came against a background of growingedginess about the outlook for interest rates.   British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson indicatedearlier today that there could be an internationally coordinatedboost in rates.   Lawson, who made the comments in an interview with the WallStreet Journal's overseas editions that was published today, notedthat a coordinated effort by West Germany, Japan and other leadingnations to hike interest rates ``is certainly possible'' followingthe Federal Reserve's increase in short-term rates to curb U.S.inflation.   Separately, White House economist Beryl Sprinkel confirmed thatthe Fed has nudged up short-term rates in recent weeks. He defendedthe move as making sense in the face of a strong economy and recentgrowth in the money supply.   Some observers and market players expect the Fed to raise itskey discount rate, the interest it charges big financialinstitutions, possibly this week.   Higher interest rates, by raising the cost of borrowing, tend todampen companies' expansion plans and investments.</TEXT></DOC>
