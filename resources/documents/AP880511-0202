WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Republican George Bush and Democrat Michael Dukakis turned theircampaigns west on Wednesday toward final primaries in Oregon andCalifornia, both firmly in command and focusing on the fall.President Reagan, in a move that surprised no one, was bestowinghis official blessing on Bush.   The lone remaining Republican opponent, television evangelistPat Robertson, bowed to the obvious at last and offered Bush hisendorsement.   Robertson said he would drop his own candidacy for theRepublican presidential nomination on Monday, weeks after he hadceased active campaigning against the vice president.   Reagan, whose support of Bush was never in doubt, planned theformal endorsement of his vice president at a Republican Partyfund-raising dinner in Washington.   He delivered a political tease of sorts when he and Bush walkedinto the Cabinet Room to meet with GOP congressional leaders.   ``I just have a very brief announcement to make,'' Reagan said,``and that is that I'll have something to say about the campaigntonight.''   With two fresh primary wins in his column, Dukakis took ahigh-speed train ride and denounced the Reagan administration fornot supporting rail service.   ``One of the reasons our airports are so overburdened is that wehave been spending the last eight years without a nationaltransportation policy,'' Dukakis said.   Bush, with a mathematical lock on the GOP convention, andDukakis, with a seemingly insurmountable delegate lead for theDemocratic nomination, were both flying to the West Coast onThursday to begin campaign swings.   Both planned visits to Oregon, ahead of Tuesday's primary there,and California, which ends the primary season June 7 along with NewJersey, New Mexico and Montana.   Democrat Jesse Jackson campaigned in Portland, Ore., and shookoff resounding primary losses to Dukakis in West Virginia andNebraska.   Robertson appeared before reporters at the White House and saidhe had given Bush his endorsement in a private meeting and wouldget out of the race.   ``I will be making that official on Monday ... because the raceis pretty much over,'' said Robertson, who won only 46 delegates ina campaign that spent more than $20 million.   He said ``I didn't ask anything for myself,'' and promised towork to have his supporters back Bush.   Asked if he would run again in 1992 if Bush loses this fall,Robertson said: ``It's conceivable. It's not a certainty.''   Robertson said he soon may return to the Christian BroadcastingNetwork that he founded and which he left last fall to run for thepresidency. He said contributions and viewers have droppeddramatically in the last year.   ``I assumed that I had built a very competent staff and thatthey would be able to run CBN in my absence,'' Robertson said in aninterview with the Norfolk, Va., Virginian-Pilot and Ledger-Star.``I did not realize that my personal presence on `The 700 Club' wasas important as it is to the audience.''   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, rode two high-speed trainsbeing tested for use between Boston and New York and denounced theReagan administration for what he said was no nationaltransportation policy and a failure to support Amtrak.   He rode the trains from Boston to Providence, R.I., and back, a50-mile one-way trip that the train covered in 32 minutes. He saidequipment needed for hourly service between New York and Bostonwould cost about $200 million.   ``This is a very, very modest investment for what could be andshould be a profitable service,'' Dukakis said.   Jackson spoke to about 1,800 students at the predominantly blackJefferson High School in Portland. He exhorted them to reject drugsand violence, and afterward led a 15-block anti-drug march from theschool through one of the city's most crime-ridden areas.   ``You get those guns out of your pockets and the drugs out ofyour life, and you can make a difference,'' he said.   Jackson insisted he was in the race until the end, despite twomore landslide wins by Dukakis Tuesday night including a delegateshutout of Jackson in West Virginia.   Dukakis has moved within striking distance of the 2,081delegates needed to nail down the Democratic nomination. Accordingto the latest Associated Press delegate count, Dukakis had 1,589 toJackson's 944.</TEXT></DOC>
