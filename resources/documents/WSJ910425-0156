The cabinet decision authorizes six naval vessels to setsail tomorrow on the first overseas mission for Japanesearmed forces since World War II. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifusaid at a news conference that as a major importer of PersianGulf oil, Japan couldn't stand by while its Western alliesbore the risk of cleaning up Iraqi mines blocking Gulf sealanes.</LP><TEXT>   The decision to dispatch four minesweepers, a support shipand a supply ship is a response to this specificcircumstance, Mr. Kaifu said. It doesn't change Japan's banagainst sending forces abroad for combat purposes, he said.   In describing the action as part of a broader program ofreconstruction in the Gulf, Mr. Kaifu also announced thatJapan would provide an additional $82.5 million in aid forthe mainly Kurdish refugees streaming out of Iraq. The money,which brings Japan's total of such assistance to $100million, followed an appeal to Mr. Kaifu by Sadako Ogata, whowas recently appointed United Nations High Commissioner forRefugees.   The minesweeper action comes despite protests from Japan'smain opposition parties, including the moderate Komeito,which recently has played an important role in helping theruling Liberal Democratic Party pass legislation in the Diet,Japan's parliament. Opposition politicians and somenewspapers argue that Japan's law authorizing naval vesselsto remove mines applies only to Japanese territorial waters,and that the minesweepers should be sent overseas only afterformal action by the Diet.   After months of overseas and domestic criticism of Japan'sseeming inability to contribute more than fat checks to theinternational effort to resolve the Gulf crisis, Mr. Kaifuwas able to act now for several reasons. Perhaps mostimportant, the United Nations' declaration this month of aformal cease-fire alleviated much of the fear that Japanesepersonnel might be drawn into combat. Japan's constitutionrenounces the use or threat of force in internationaldisputes.   Another element in the political equation is the strongperformance of the ruling party in this month's localelections, amid heavy losses by the leftist Socialist Party.The Socialists, the largest of Japan's opposition parties,have argued that any dispatch of Japanese military personneloverseas violates the constitution and risks a resurgence ofmilitarism.   Some policy makers here argue that the debate on the Gulfcrisis has caused the public, as one senior Foreign Ministryofficial puts it, to &quot;crawl out of its cocoon&quot; and grope fora less isolationist international role -- within theconstraints of Japan's anti-war constitution.   Japanese business leaders, concerned about relations withforeign trading partners, have called on the government tohelp clear the sea lanes now that the war is over. Recentopinion polls suggest that most Japanese favor sendingminesweepers to the Gulf.   Minesweepers from other nations had removed about 300 ofthe 1,200 or so Iraqi sea mines by the end of March. Tokyoofficials estimate it will take five months more to finishthe job, and they insist that Japanese vessels can providesubstantial help. But the minesweepers will probably take amonth to travel the 7,000 nautical miles to the Gulf.</TEXT></DOC>
