Such government screening brought protests earlier from Chinaand other countries, which accused Japan of trying to cover upmilitary brutality.   Despite its ruling on wartime operations, the court held in onecase that a government-ordered rewrite distorted history.   The Tokyo District Court ruled in Professor Saburo Iyenaga's25-year battle against the Education Ministry's textbook screening.It ordered the ministry to pay him $711.   Iyenaga, who writes textbooks, plans to appeal to the HighCourt, said district court spokesman Akira Saito.   Iyenaga, 76, had demanded $14,235 and wanted the screeningsystem overturned. His complaint dealt mainly withgovernment-ordered rewrites concerning Japan's actions in World WarII. The court rejected that portion of his argument.   However, Judge Kazuo Kato said the Education Ministry abused itsinspection authority and contradicted mainstream academic theoriesin ordering Iyenaga to rewrite part of a 1980 textbook dealing withan attempted coup by farmers against the Tokugawa Shogunategovernment in 1868.   The court ruled against Iyenaga on his complaints that inwriting textbooks, he could not use the terms ``invasion,''``Nanking massacre,'' ``No. 731 regiment'' and ``battle inOkinawa'' in describing wartime actions by Japanese troops.   China says more than 300,000 people, mostly civilians, werekilled or raped by Japanese soldiers in December 1937 afterNanking, then China's capital, fell to Japanese invasion forces.Western historians have estimated that 200,000 were killed in themassacre.   The Battle of Okinawa in 1945 was Japan's last and bloodieststand during World War II. Okinawan officials said Japanese troopskilled 800 Okinawan civilians because they were an obstacle tomilitary operations and ordered others to commit suicide.   No. 731 regiment refers to a unit alleged to have conducted germexperiments on war prisoners.   Kato said textbook inspection was justified to preserve accuracyand neutrality in education. He held that textbook inspection doesnot violate the constitutional right to freedom of expressionbecause material rejected by the ministry still can be published.   He said in his ruling, ``Considering students' inability toevaluate educational contents, the little choice of educationaltools allowed to teachers, and the need for equal opportunity foreducation, the government cannot allow teachers complete freedom topublish their own studies as textbooks.''   Education Minister Kazuya Ishibashi said in a statement, ``Theadequacy and necessity of the textbook inspection system werereconfirmed by today's court ruling, and we in the EducationMinistry will work even harder to make the contents of textbooksmore satisfying.   He said, however, that he objected to the payment and said thegovernment might appeal.   Iyenaga told reporters, ``We are very disappointed by theruling. But the Education Ministry should take it seriously andblame itself for having gone too far in its censorship.   ``I am also disappointed by the court's backward and biasedattitude.''   The suit, filed in 1984, was Iyenaga's third against thescreening system.</TEXT></DOC>
