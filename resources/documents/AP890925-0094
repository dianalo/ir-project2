Chidzero,the finance minister of Zimbabwe.   He is chairman of the Development Committee, which bringstogether members of governments from the Third World and richercountries. Its sessions, part of the annual meetings of the WorldBank and the International Monetary Fund, ended Monday.   ``Neglect of the environment will increase the cost ofdevelopment,'' Chidzero told reporters.   ``The environment is a long-term investment. ... Neglect maysuperficially facilitate development, but not in the long run.''   His statement contrasted with the view, once widely held in theThird World, that efforts at conservation are an obstacle to theirprogress or even part of a plot by former colonial powers to holdthem back.   Chidzero appeared at a news conference on a DevelopmentCommittee report, ``World Bank Support for the Environment,'' madepublic Monday. The bank is owned by 152 countries, with the largestvoting power in the hands of the United States. It is the largestsource of development loans to Third World countries.   Figures the bank made public last week showed a continuingdecline of incomes in many Third World countries in 1988. Figuresfrom its sister organization, the International Monetary Fund,indicate a continued decline of average incomes in much of southernAfrica and Latin America.   The World Bank has been heavily criticized by environmentalistsand members of Congress as neglecting or even undercuttingconservation. For example, it helped build a major road in westernBrazil that brought in large numbers of settlers whose main purposewas to destroy the rain forest so they could plant crops.   Managers of the bank have countered criticism with increasedattention to environment issues.   ``If the World Bank has been part of the problem in the past, itcan and will be a strong force in finding solutions for thefuture,'' Bank President Barber Conable was quoted as saying in anew brochure issued by the bank. The brochure is called ``Strikinga Balance _ The Environmental Challenge of Development.''   ``The bank's goal is to blur the lines between environmentalactivities and the rest of the bank's work,'' it said.   The bank approved more than $21 billion in new loans last year.It has been trying to take environmental protection into accounteach time it makes a loan. On Sunday it announced that it a newphase of a joint project with the European Investment Bank and theU.N. Development Fund to help clean up the Mediterranean. Initiallyit will have $10 million to $15 million to spend.   The brochure told of moving a group of Patagonian conures, arare parrot, to new breeding areas when the old ones were about tobe disturbed by a dam under construction in Chile. Other projectswill help manage forests in Sri Lanka and promote reforestation inBangladesh.</TEXT></DOC>
