Although he died before the war ended in 1975, ``Uncle Ho,'' whopreached a blend of Confucianism and communism, was the drivingforce behind Hanoi's war effort.   But Ho's hopes for a peaceful and prosperous postwar state werenever realized. The country today faces growing economic woes,political isolation and the continuing war in neighboring Cambodiasparked by Vietnam's 1978 invasion.   The official Voice of Vietnam radio devoted a half-hour tributeto Ho on the 100th anniversary of his birth, playing musicdedicated to the ``great national hero.''   It aired a recording of Ho's declaration of the founding ofCommunist North Vietnam in September 1945, which the radio calledthe most emotional moment in his life.   Nationwide celebrations Saturday included cultural festivals,parades, mass meetings and the unveiling of memorials to Ho, theofficial media said.   Western analysts have pointed to the darker side of Ho'sleadership, including the land reform program in the 1950s in whichup to 50,000 people died.   But in Vietnam, any public criticism of Ho is unlikely.Dissenters are virtually without voice.   An American who was recently held in Vietnam for allegedanti-government activities said security officials anticipatedpossible trouble on the anniversary and were arresting dissidentsin Saigon, the former South Vietnamese capital. It was renamed HoChi Minh City by the Communists.   Born in Nghe An in central Vietnam in 1890, Ho was the son of apoor but educated father who schooled him in Confucian philosophyand patriotism.   Ho went to Paris as a student in the early 1920s and was caughtup in radical politics. With Lenin's work as his inspiration, hevowed to fight to liberate Vietnam from French colonialists.   He founded the Indochinese Communist Party in 1930, and wastutored by both Soviet and Chinese Communists. In 1941 he found theVietminh front, the backbone of the guerrilla insurgency thatdefeated the French in 1954 and the U.S.-backed South Vietnamgovernment in 1975.   Both the French and the Americans found him a brilliantstrategist and a ruthless, relentless opponent.   ``The war may last five years, 10 or 20 years,'' he said beforehis death in September 1969. ``Hanoi, Haiphong and a number ofmunicipalities and enterprises may be destroyed, but the Vietnamesepeople are not afraid.''   ``When we achieve victory,'' he boasted, ``the Vietnamese peoplewill build their country bigger and more beautiful.''   But today the official Vietnam media almost daily bemoan thecorruption, food shortages and crumbling state enterprises.   And the country's isolation is growing, despite a troop pulloutfrom Cambodia last year that eased some of the concerns of theWest. Its traditional allies, the Soviet Union and the EasternEurope countries, have significantly reduced aid.   In recent months, Vietnam, with its continued hard-lineadherence to socialism, found itself out of step with thedemocratic changes elsewhere.   In a gathering in Hanoi to mark the Ho centenary, Vietnam'sCommunist Party chief Nguyen Van Linh insisted Friday that thecountry would continue to adhere to Ho's objectives.   ``Despite the current serious challenges, socialism is bound toovercome immediate difficulties and prevail,'' the official VietnamNews Agency quoted him as saying.   The report, seen here Saturday, said senior representatives fromthe Soviet Union, Laos, Cambodia and India attended the gathering.India is the only major non-Communist country friendly to Hanoi.   ``On this solemn occasion, our entire party and people furtherreaffirm the determination forever to follow the path thatPresident Ho Chi Minh has chosen,'' said Linh, whose 3-year-oldadministration has made Western-style economic changes but avoidedsubstantial political ones.   A U.S. private humanitarian agency, the International Mission ofHope, said it, too, had plans to commmemorate the anniversary ofHo's birth. It was opening a health clinic Saturday at the wartimemassacre site of My Lai village.</TEXT></DOC>
