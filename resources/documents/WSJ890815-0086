Rubin was a major in the KGB. The next day, he became a vice president of a co-operative venture in Kazan. Now he is one of the 1.9 million persons employed in the co-operative sector of the Soviet economy. In January 1988, there were just 156,000.    &quot;I had been on duty for 25 years,&quot; Mr. Rubin says. &quot;I became sick of orders and instructions from my commanders. I suffered from insomnia and heart diseases. But now I've got responsibility and initiative. I sleep like a child but there are nights when I wake up, go to my kitchen, and think over some business combinations. It gives me real satisfaction.&quot;    There were 99,300 co-ops in operation in the Soviet Union on April 1, 1989, six times as many as a year earlier. Contrary to stereotype, they are not all perogi-shops. Co-ops produce processed wood, metal products and computer software as well as advanced technological research: 24% of the co-ops' sales derive from consumer goods; 17% from consumer services including restaurants; 14% from construction; and 6% from conducting research and development on contract for other enterprises. In smaller proportions, co-ops appear throughout the rest of the Soviet economy, although since the special decree of Dec. 29, 1988, forbidding co-ops to offer health care, medical services have slipped to just 1% of total co-op sales. Five hundred co-ops have been granted recognition as official exporters.    These enterprises are very close in legal status to U.S. limited partnerships, and some are ready to become corporations as soon as the Supreme Soviet adopts a Corporations Act later this year.    Before the government enacted its Cooperatives Law in May 1988, Soviets could go into business for themselves only with special permission from the local authorities and were obliged to employ primarily students, the disabled and pensioners. They had no right to sell their goods and services to state enterprises. The May 1988 law eliminated most of these restrictions.    The most serious opponent of independent economic activity in the Soviet Union, after the Soviet bureaucracy, is the general public. Co-op managers get blamed for shortages of food and consumer goods as well as for inflation.    A public opinion poll in the March issue of the Soviet magazine, &quot;20th Century and Peace,&quot; suggests that more than 86% of the population still holds an &quot;equal income&quot; mentality. Since a co-op employee earns, on average, twice as much as a state industry worker (co-op managers, of course, make even more), the potential for resentment is real. The closing of all co-operatives was one of the demands of the Siberian coal-miners when they went on strike in July. As Valery G. Yurchenko, once an economic researcher but now the manager of a restaurant in Leningrad, puts it: &quot;It looks as if co-operatives were created as a bone to be thrown to the public when it comes to a hunger riot.&quot;    Independent businesses are also threatened by organized crime. The press is full of horrible stories of violence toward new entrepreneurs and their families. Private security agencies and body-guards, formerly unknown, have emerged as the result of booming crime. Corrupt Soviet officials sometimes collaborate with the criminals. Several co-op managers told me they had to hire bank employees on a part-time basis because bank officials -- to whom the employees kicked back part of their salaries -- had threatened to disclose co-ops' financial accounts to racketeers.    Despite the hostile environment, these enterprises nevertheless have achieved extraordinary results. According to official statistics, co-op sales increased from 350 million rubles in 1987 to 6.5 billion rubles in 1988. In the first quarter of 1989 sales were 4.3 billion rubles. And even these numbers may be an underestimate. Many local authorities deliberately misrepresent co-operatives' performance to conceal the inefficiency of state industry. An independent study found that in some regions coops' actual sales were up to nine times higher than officially reported.    To protect themselves from officialdom, some co-ops form joint ventures with state enterprises, while others launch huge social-responsibility programs and widely advertise them. In Leningrad, Mr. Yurchenko, the restaurant manager, established the first independent labor union officially registered in the Soviet Union. This union is to defend the economic rights of co-ops' employees both against their employers and against local bureaucrats.    But the most interesting trend is the politicization of the co-operative movement. Co-op businessmen have united in local, regional and national associations to protect their economic interests through political activity. During the recent elections to the new Congress of People's Deputies several co-operative businessmen were denied the right to register as candidates. The most famous Soviet entrepreneur, Artiem Tarasov -- whose personal income from his high-tech Randamp;D and software-writing co-op amounted to 3 million rubles last year -- did, however, manage to become a candidate, despite Mr. Gorbachev's criticisms of him for his foreign trade speculations.    Mr. Tarasov lost the race but more and more such political activity can be expected from co-operative businessmen. In late July, they held the first officially recognized convention, which established the National Co-operative Association. Mr. Tarasov was elected vice president of the association; Nikolai Tikhonov, a radical economist and a member of the new Soviet parliament, was elected president.    Many co-op managers believe that their only chance for survival lies in business contacts with the West. In addition to obtaining political safety for the Soviet partners, joint ventures with Western firms are governed by more liberal regulation than are co-operatives -- including lighter taxation. As the most talented people desert the state sector, Soviet co-ops can offer Western partners a highly educated and low-wage labor force.    No kidding about the latter. Soviet co-ops lack capital and management technique, not scientific knowledge. This could turn out to be an intriguing opportunity for many Western industrial companies and venture capitalists, as the most motivated and aggressive scientists leave state labs and factories to launch their own ventures.    Alexander Rubin was the last person to call me before my departure from Moscow. He is looking for a foreign partner to co-produce a newly patented environmentally safe construction material, a substitute for cement. Mr. Rubin is optimistic about his business prospects. And many of his colleagues and rivals all over the Soviet Union are just as optimistic about their own.    ---   Mr. Kuteinikov, a Soviet economist, is a correspondent for the Moscow News in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
