Officially declared dead by Moscow, he is afaint shadow who over the last 43 years has wandered throughprisons, mental hospitals and labor camps.   Whether dead or alive, the Swedish diplomat lives at least forthose who admire his courage in saving thousands of people fromNazi death camps during World War II. He would be 76.   Rumors reaching his family say Wallenberg, arrested by theSoviets in Budapest, Hungary, in the waning days of the war, wasstill living in an isolation cell earlier this year.   ``We have indications. That's all we can say without endangeringpeople. They are not witnesses, only indications,'' said hishalf-sister, Nina Lagergren.   The Soviets never explained why they arrested Wallenberg, but itis likely they suspected him of being an American spy. The Kremlinlater expressed regret.   ``We cannot have a question in our minds that he is alive,''said Mrs. Lagergren, 67, in an interview. ``How could we work for40 years for his freedom if there was a doubt in our minds? We haveto believe.''   Mrs. Lagergren, who runs the Raoul Wallenberg Committee ofSweden, clings to any reason for hope.   In Soviet prisons, she said, ``people can survive a long time.It may be cynical to call it good, but there is no stress fromdaily life, you don't overeat, you don't drink or smoke. Humanshave a fantastic ability to adapt.''   Swedish author Kenne Fant, whose novel ``R,'' based onWallenberg's imprisonment, was published in August, said hebelieves the prisoner's records have been destroyed and that hisidentity may be lost forever.   Pressure to find Wallenberg persists.   ``We raise the question at every opportunity,'' said VollrathTham, the Foreign Ministry official in charge of the Wallenbergfile. The U.S. and Israeli governments also are active.   On Sept. 16, Warren Zimmermann, U.S. delegation chief at theVienna Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, demanded``a full and open accounting'' of Wallenberg's fate.   Soviet spokesman Gennady Gerasimov, replying four days later ata news briefing in Moscow, said that according to a handwrittenreport found in 1957 in the Lubyanka Prison archives, Wallenbergdied in 1947 of a heart attack, two years after his arrest. It saidhe was cremated.   ``There is nothing new in it,'' said Mrs. Lagergren. ``They haverepeated it for 30 years, and if you study it, it's quiteunbelievable. Even they concede there is no evidence that Raoul isdead.''   Mrs. Lagergren said she hoped for a new probe of the case,because she believed the Soviets were interested in clearing therecord on the crimes of the Stalin era.   When he was 32, Wallenberg went to Budapest at the suggestion ofthe U.S. War Refugee Board. Besides providing passports and ``safehouses'' for Jews, he dissuaded the Nazis from blowing up theJewish ghetto before evacuating the city, saving its 70,000residents from probable death.   Wallenberg had been in Hungary six months when he was arrested.Many Hungarian Jews credited Wallenberg for their survival.   Fant said that while researching his novel, he spoke withsomeone, whom he did not identify, who heard Wallenberg was seenDec. 22, 1986, in the south-central labor camp of Blagoveshchenka,a closed city in the Soviet Union.   Fant told reporters in August his source ``has been in touchwith a person who saw a bent old man at the labor camp who wasbeing treated for frostbite on his right foot. This man wasdescribed by fellow inmates as the one who saved Jews in Budapest.''   In 1974, Wallenberg was reported seen in the Siberian camp ofVadivovo. He was described as an old-looking man with thin whitehair who had been ill.   Sweden questioned the Soviets about Wallenberg in 1956 and againin 1965, but let the case lie dormant until a new eyewitnessaccount surfaced in 1978.   Under pressure from Israel, President Jimmy Carter raised theissue at the 1979 summit with Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev.   ``That was during the detente period. We hoped that Raoul wouldbe back within a year,'' said Mrs. Lagergren.   Gorbachev's glasnost policy has revived hope, said Mrs.Lagergren. Her other brother, Guy von Dardel, ``was in the SovietUnion in June, and he felt the atmosphere had changed. They weremuch more open and cooperative,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
