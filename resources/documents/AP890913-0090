The pharmaceutical maker said it is confident there was nothingwrong with the safety or effectiveness of the drugs, which wererecalled Tuesday from wholesalers and had never reached pharmacies.   An inpection by the Food and Drug Administration last month foundobjectionable conditions in nearly every area of Lilly'sIndianapolis capsule and tablet plant, including failure to havewritten standard operating procedures for many tasks andrecord-keeping problems.   ``In nearly every system examined, the available data were foundto be incomplete or inaccurately summarized,'' the FDA said. Resultsof that inspection were made public Tuesday.   In response, Lilly voluntarily recalled 18 batches of drugs andhalted distribution of all products from the plant, whichmanufactures a relatively small amount of the company's capsules andtablets, said spokesman Ed West.   Distribution will resume when revised procedures have beenestablished, probably within weeks, West said.   He said the recall and distribution shutdown would not affectavailability of any major products, and the cost to the company wasnegligible.   Among the medicines recalled were Darvon, a pain reliever;Tapazole, a thyroid medication; Aventyl, an antidepressant, andNalfon, an anti-inflammation drug.   Acting Director Felix Schneider of the FDA's Midwest office inDetroit said the agency is looking at other Lilly operations andwill make similar inspections of other drug companies.</TEXT></DOC>
