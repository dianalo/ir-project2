Israeli officials initially said the operation that began Mondaynight was small in scale and would last only about 24 hours, butDefense Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Wednesday the soldiers were ina tough battle.   An army announcement later said the operation ended Wednesdaynight with three Israeli soldiers dead and 17 wounded. It said morethan 40 guerrillas were killed, nearly all in Maydoun village, astronghold of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.   At first, the primary objective appeared to be convincingvillagers not to provide guides and other aid to guerrillas, whohave made a dozen raids across Israel's northern border since lastNovember.   A military source said privately, however, that ``the originalplan changed'' when the guerrillas stood and fought.   The newspaper Haaretz said Israeli officials were angry aboutinformation leaks just before troops entered Lebanon under cover ofdarkness.   ``Early publication of the army operation in Lebanon without theapproval of military censorship chased away hundreds of guerrillaswho were the main objective of the operation, and in fact causedthe main goal of the operation to fail,'' the independent dailysaid.   Some military analysts who criticized the mission said it mayencourage more attacks across the frontier rather than deterringthe guerrillas.   Yossi Olmert of Tel Aviv University said: ``The results won't bevery significant.''   He said guerrilla activity in the past two decades ``shows thatafter military actions like this, they'll just try harder againagainst us just to make a show of force.''   Olmert also expressed doubt that the thrust to within a fewmiles of Syrian army lines in east Lebanon would encourage Syria tocontrol the guerrillas.   ``It's very likely that Syria is not impressed by thisoperation,'' he said in an interview.   Yehoshua Saguy, former chief of army intelligence, predicted theguerrillas would only suffer a temporary setback.   In an Israel television interview, he said: ``The immediateachievement will be a relative calming down and decline in attemptsto infiltrate and attack for the not too distant future.''   Saguy also said: ``We will have to repeat such operations toprevent the guerrillas from reorganizing in the area.''   Israel ended a three-year occupation of south Lebanon in June1985. Many Israelis were left with deep suspicions about futuremilitary entanglements, and the new operation raised immediatequestions.   ``It's always easier to go in than it is to come out,''Transportation Minister Chaim Corfu told The Associated Press.   Military commentator Ron Ben-Yishai predicted in the dailyYediot Ahronot that guerrillas would resume and even redouble theirefforts to get into Israel.   Palestinian guerrilla groups will continue military action toshow support for Palestinians who have rebelled for five monthsagainst Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he said.   Ariel Merari, an expert on terrorism at the independent JaffeeCenter for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, said the effect of such aquick thrust would not last long, especially without the element ofsurprise.   ``The main achievement is immediate if it comes as a surprise,''he said. ``If it doesn't come as a surprise, what remains, and thatis doubtful, is deterrence of the local population from cooperatingwith terrorists.''</TEXT></DOC>
