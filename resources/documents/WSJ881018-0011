Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> OFF </IN><TEXT>   The introduction of cheaper &quot;plain paper&quot; facsimile machines should accelerate the merging of technologies behind faxes, laser printers and copiers. That, in turn, should continue to cut the costs of the machines and expand their market.    Sharp Electronics Corp. and Ricoh Corp. recently announced faxes that use normal paper, rather than the rolls of chemically treated, heat-sensitive paper most faxes use to reproduce documents from signals transmitted over telephone lines.    Plain-paper faxes figure to be the wave of the future, because they provide sharper copies that don't smudge or fade as current faxes do. They also use paper that is less expensive and easier to handle.    Although still expensive, the new plain-paper fax machines' list prices break what consultants call the magic barrier of $6,000, compared with more than $10,000 for the few plain-paper faxes previously available. Moreover, faxes tend to sell for far less than the list prices.    The Sharp machine, available late this month, and the Ricoh fax, available since July, use the same sort of engine used in laser printers, which resembles, in turn, the device used in copiers. As the technologies progress, that will mean that faxes will be better able to make copies or serve as printers, just as some copiers will soon be able to serve as printers.    The engine similarities have helped solve the chicken-and-egg problem that confronts new technologies, which must be cheap to become popular but require huge volumes for cheap manufacture. Sharp and Ricoh, U.S. subsidiaries of Sharp Corp. and Ricoh Co., both of Japan, took advantage of growing demand for laser printers to drive down the costs of the engines in their plain-paper faxes. As the new machines take hold in coming years, further manufacturing economies are expected to help drive costs still lower.    In addition, products that handle faxing, printing and copying will cost less than separate products to handle the three functions, appealing to people whose use is too sparse to require separate machines.    &quot;It's all merging,&quot; said Judy Pirani, an analyst at CAP International Inc., a market research firm based in Norwell, Mass.    The fax market is already growing fast: CAP says the U.S. market has nearly tripled in the past two years, to more than $1.8 billion this year.    In addition, circuit boards have become available over the past year or so that plug into personal computers and let them send and receive documents to and from faxes. Services are also springing up that, for a fee, will handle the translation necessary to send electronic mail from a personal computer to a fax machine or to print out telexes there. Many big hotels now offer fax services, and Faxplus Corp., Santa Clara, Calif., has said it will install what it calls public fax machines; they will sit in hotel lobbies or airports and can be used by anyone wielding a credit card.    The market has become big enough that International Business Machines Corp. recently made a filing with the Federal Communications Commission that indicates it might introduce a fax circuit board.    Faxes have become so ubiquitous that many people are being inundated with a new form of junk mail. Ms. Pirani of CAP says some fax machines now come with security devices, preventing anyone from sending to that machine without a password. </TEXT></DOC>
