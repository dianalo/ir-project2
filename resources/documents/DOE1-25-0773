Gas mixture coming to the drift chamber was analyzedby means of the LKhM-8NR gas chromatograph. Total content of impuritiesmade up less than 0.01%. Drift velocities were measured in the followingmixtures: CH/sub 4/ (100%); CH/sub 4/ (90%) + Xe (10%); CH/sub 4/ (65%)+ Xe (35%); CH/sub 4/ (50%) + Xe (50%); CH/sub 4/ (80%) + Xe (20%). Compositionof the mixture was controlled with an accuracy not worse than 1%. Ineach gas mixture drift velocities were measured in the range of driftfields from 0.2 to 0.9 kV/cm. The results of drift velocity measurementsare tabulated. 6 refs.; 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
