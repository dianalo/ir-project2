TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After two years of protests, strikes andbloodshed, the Palestinian uprising has lost its way, failing todeliver a Palestinian state or even negotiations with Israel.   At the same time, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir'sgovernment, which refuses to talk with Yasser Arafat's PalestineLiberation Organization, is increasingly frustrated over itsinability to restore calm either through diplomacy or force of arms.   Divisions on both sides have blocked compromises that could havestarted negotiations.   Unless peace efforts gain momentum, the prospects are for evenmeaner streets with radical Palestinians gaining influence andcalling for the use of guns, not words, to solve the problem.   The toll from the ``intefadeh'' _ Arabic for uprising _ isalready fearful.   By Associated Press count, 626 Palestinians have been killed byIsraelis. U.N. figures show 39,000 Arabs wounded and 40,000 jailed,9,000 of whom were denied a trial. Also, 363 Arab houses have beendemolished or sealed, and 60 activists deported.   On the other side, 43 Israelis have died and 2,438 civilians and1,635 soldiers were wounded in more than 60,000 incidents ofunrest. Israel's economy suffered about $800 million in lostproduction and tourism as well as increased military costs,including two months a year of reserve duty for most men.   Despite the high cost, Palestinians have scored gains:   They succeeded in defining the territory in the West Bank, GazaStrip and east Jerusalem that they want for an independent state.Except for soldiers, most Israelis rarely venture into these areasnow.   The underground, pro-PLO Unified National Leadership of theUprising has also demonstrated unity and determination withonce-a-week general strikes and the closure of stores andbusinesses every afternoon.   But the strikes and rock-throwing have become routine, almostmechanical gestures that, despite the ongoing bloodshed, no longercarry the political punch needed to arouse international concernand pressure on Israel.   ``I believe over the last few months we have lost theinitiative, and there has been a vacuum of strategy. We haven't hadany renewed strategic plan to put into the intefadeh,'' said SariNusseibeh, a leading Palestinian intellectual.   Nusseibeh, a philosphy professor considered by Israelis to be asenior pro-PLO activist, said Palestinians should use ``positiveenergy'' to create a provisional government.   He proposed health, education, welfare and other organizationsbe united into area-wide PLO-run institutions that could serve asthe basis for ministries in a future government.   Israel's government launched an initiative to start the peaceprocess with elections in the occupied lands to chose a Palestiniandelegation for talks. But the Cabinet is deeply divided and unableto deliver compromises to satisfy Palestinian demands that the PLOhave a public role.   Two prominent Israeli intellectuals, journalists Ehud Yaari andZeev Shiff, proposed that Israel stage an ``administrativewithdrawal'' from occupied lands as an interim step until electionscan be arranged.   They suggested turning over some government functions tomoderate Palestinians who would be likely to win elections if theywere held.   ``Thus some of the burden of occupation would be removed andfriction between the inhabitants and the Israeli army will bereduced,'' they wrote.   Ephraim Sneh, a retired general who once headed the West Bankmilitary government, told a seminar at Hebrew University that thePLO, in seeking to influence international opinion, had failed topersuade average Israelis that it had really wanted peace.   Sneh called for Palestinians to shift focus and ``understand inthe coming year that their real opportunity is not in gaining thesympathy of the world but the confidence of Israelis.''   ``Israeli society is a traumatized society,'' he said, alludingto the Jews' experience with the Nazi Holocaust and repeated warswith the Arabs.   ``It is difficult for the Israelis to believe that after 22years, the PLO really abandoned terrorism,'' he said.   In recent months, there has been increasing concern about therise of Palestinian radicals who oppose negotiations and advocatearmed struggle.   Splits in Palestinian ranks are already clear with smallextremist groups taking over neighborhoods or towns and, accordingto underground leaflets, operating independently.   Inter-Palestinian violence has increased. Palestinians havekilled 154 of their fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of informingfor Israel.   Groups calling themselves the Black Panthers and Red Eaglescontrolled the Casbah quarter of the West Bank's largest city ofNablus, killing 25 suspected collaborators and shooting at Israelioutposts.   The army claimed to have neutralized the two groups, killing orcapturing their leaders in recent weeks, but there is ongoingconcern such groups will proliferate as frustrations grow over alack of progress toward peace talks.   Hanna Siniora, editor of the Arabic daily Al Fajr in Jerusalem,said peace prospects appeared bleak but that the Palestinianleadership was trying to maintain its no-guns policy.   ``Palestinians are trying in every way to keep this anon-violent resistance movement in order to positively affectIsrael public opinion,'' he said, calling for increasedIsraeli-Palestinian dialogue.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Nicolas B.
