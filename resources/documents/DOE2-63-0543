The implantations were performed using50- to 400-keV boron ions to a maximum dosage of 1.5 x 10{sup 16}/sq.cm, and the annealing was accomplished at 500C under vacuum. The spectralmeasurements were made at 77 K near the E{sub 0} and E{sub 1} criticalpoints; all the spectra were computer-fitted to Aspnes' theory. The spectralline shapes from the ion-damaged, partially recovered and undamaged,or fully recovered regions could be identified, and the respective volumefraction of each phase was estimated.</TEXT></DOC>
