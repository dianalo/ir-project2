Background</ITAG>Federal agencies are required by various statutes, Executive orders, andregulations to obtain certain representations and certifications from offerorsas part of the bid/proposal evaluation process. These representations andcertifications aid the Federal agency in determining the eligibility ofthe offeror to receive a Federal contract award. The customary practiceof most Federal agencies is to require the submission of these representationsand certifications with each bid or proposal.With the promulgation of the Department of Energy Acquisition Regulation(DEAR) on April 1, 1984 (49 FR 11922, March 28, 1984), the Department ofEnergy (DOE) implemented the use of a simplified offeror representationand certification procedure on an elective basis by its contracting activities.The purpose of this optional procedure was to reduce administrative andpaperwork burdens on offerors (particularly small businesses, educationalinstitutions, and nonprofit organizations) in submitting the representationsand certifications needed by DOE as part of the contract award process.Regulatory coverage for the optional simplified representation and certificationprocedure was contained in the DEAR at section 915.406-5.In essence, this simplified procedure permitted those offerors, who submittednumerous bids and proposals to a particular DOE contracting activity, tocomplete and place on file with that organization a comprehensive submissionof recurrent representations and certifications. The representations andcertifications considered to be ``recurrent'' were those that would applyto virtually all contracts, and, therefore, did not need to be executedby offerors with each individual contract award. Upon acceptance by thecontracting activity, the comprehensive submission would be placed on recordwith the contracting activity for a period of three years. During thisthree year period, those offerors who submitted an acceptable comprehensiverepresentations and certifications package would need only to submit withtheir bids and proposals (1) a certification regarding the accuracy andcurrency of their comprehensive submission, (2) any representations andcertifications that differed from those contained in their comprehensivesubmission, and (3) any additional representations and certifications requiredby the instant solicitation or contract.Subsequently, DOE amended its acquisition regulations (the DEAR) to furthersimplify the submission of representations and certifications (50 FR 35956,September 4, 1985). This amendment mandated the use of simplified proceduresby DOE's contracting activities in obtaining representations and certificationsfrom offerors through what could be characterized as a phased submissionprocess. By implementing these further simplified procedures, DOE anticipatedthat additional administrative efficiencies would be realized both by itsown contracting actitivities and by offerors.In implementing this new requirement, DOE developed a three part form forrepresentations and certifications whereby all offerors would initiallysubmit, with their proposal, the minimally needed representations and certificationsto allow for evaluation of the bid or proposal by DOE. A comprehensivesubmission of recurrent representations and certifications would only beobtained by DOE from the successful offeror. This later submission wouldthen be placed on file with the contracting activity in a repository andremain valid for that offeror for a period of three years, subject to certainconditions. Under this procedure, offerors not advancing to selection foraward of a contract would be spared the time and expense of completingunnecessary paperwork.The amendments being proposed today would revise existing coverage of thesimplified representation and certification submission procedures by eliminatingthe requirements for mandatory use of the simplified approach, for useof the three part form, and for the maintenance of a central repository.In lieu thereof, DOE will use a one-part comprehensive format to be completedand submitted by offerors as part of their proposal at the time of bidor proposal submission. The use of an annual representations and certificationssubmission procedure will remain as an option to DOE contracting activities,using the appropriate coverage in the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR),as supplemented by the DEAR.The lack of Governmentwide implementation of significantly similar procedureshas resulted in offerors having to establish several approaches to providethe representations and certifications to individual Federal agencies inresponse to their solicitations. In this regard, DOE has discovered thatmany times offerors are not fully complying with DOE's solicitation instructionsregarding the submission of the three part form, but rather continue tocomplete the whole form with each bid or proposal; offerors thus are nottaking the advantages that could accrue to them in future bid/proposalsubmittals by not having to complete the full complement of representationsand certifications on a proposal-by-proposal basis. This situation is complicatedby the decentralized operations of DOE's contracting activities. Individualofferors that have received contract awards from more than one contractingactivity must submit the full complement of representations and certificationsto each awarding contracting activity to establish the ``official file''version of the recurrent portion of the representation and certificationsubmission. Further, absent universal acceptance of its procedures by offerors,DOE has, in effect, been forced to operate under two systems to obtainthis needed information. Because of the oftentimes sporadic offeror compliancewith the three part procedures, the administrative burden on the individualDOE contracting activity in establishing and maintaining the central repositoryat the local level is great.Therefore, DOE has concluded that these amendments to the existing simplifiedrepresentations and certifications submission procedures are needed becausethe expected benefits of the current procedures both to offerors and DOEare not being realized. DOE has further concluded that a reliance on theFAR coverage of the subject will probably result in less of an administrativeand paperwork burden on all affected parties through the use of the FARapproach.As a result, DEAR section 914.201-5, ``Part IV_Representations and instructions,''which provides instructions concerning the use of the simplified threepart representations and certifications in sealed bidding, and DEAR section915.406-5, ``Part IV Representations and instructions,'' governing negotiatedacquisitions, are being amended to implement the revised policies regardingthe submission of representations and certifications by offerors. In addition,the solicitation provisions at DEAR section 952.215.71, ``Simplified representationsand certifications_negotiated acquisition'' and DEAR sections 952.215-72,``Simplified representations and certifications_sealed bid,'' will be removedas they will no longer be necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Procedural Requirements</ITAG>A. Review Under Executive Order 12291This Executive order, entitled ``Federal Regulation,'' requires that certainregulations be reviewed by the Office of Mangement and Budget (OMB) priorto their promulgation. OMB Bulletin 85-7 exempts all but certain typesof procurement regulations from such review. This proposed rule does notinvolve any of the topics requiring review under the Bulletin and, accordingly,is exempt from such review.B. Review Under the Regulatory Flexibility ActThis proposed rule was reviewed under the Regulatory Flexibility Act of1980, Pub. L. 96-354, which requires preparation of a regulatory flexibilityanalysis for any rule which is likely to have significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. DOE certifies that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities and, therefore, no regulatory flexibility analysis has beenprepared.C. Review Under the Paperwork Reduction ActNo new information collection or recordkeeping requirements are imposedby this proposed rulemaking. Accordingly, no OMB clearance is requiredunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3>).D. Review Under the National Environmental Policy ActDOE has concluded that promulgation of this rule would not represent amajor Federal action having significant impact on the human environmentunder the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321<T3>et seq. </T3>(1976)), or the Council on Environmental Quality regulations(40 CFR Parts 1500 through 1508), and the DOE Guidelines (40 CFR Parts1021), and, therefore, does not require an environmental impact statementor an environmental assessment pursuant to NEPA.E. Review Under Executive Order 12612Executive Order 12612 requires that regulations, rules, legislation, andany other policy actions be reviewed for any substantial direct effectson States, on the relationship between the national government and theStates, or in the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. If there are sufficient substantial directeffects, then the Executive order requires preparation of a federalismassessment to be used in all decisions involved in promulgating and implementinga policy action.Today's proposed rule, when finalized, will implement certain policiesand procedures set forth in the FAR relating to the methods used by Federalagencies to collect the representations and certifications of offerorsthat are needed as part of the contract award process. States which contractwith DOE will be subject to this rule. However, DOE has determined thatthis rule will not have a substantial direct effect on the institutionalinterests or traditional functions of the States.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments</ITAG>Interested persons are invited to participate by submitting data, views,or arguments with respect to the proposed DEAR amendments set forth inthis notice. There copies of written comments should be submitted to theaddress indicated in the ``ADDRESS'' section of this notice. All writtencomments received by August 21, 1989, will be carefully assessed and fullyconsidered prior to publication of the proposed amendment as a final rule.DOE has concluded that this proposed rule does not involve a substantialissue of fact or law, and that the proposed rule should not have a substantialimpact on the nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses.Therefore, pursuant to Pub. L. 95-91, the DOE Organization Act, and theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), the Department does not planto hold a public hearing on this proposed rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>48 CFR Part 914Sealed bidding.48 CFR Part 915Contracting by negotiation.48 CFR Part 952Solicitation provisions and contract clauses.For the reasons set out in the preamble, Parts 914, 915, and 952 of Title48 of the Code of Federal Regulations are proposed to be amended as setforth below.<ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.
