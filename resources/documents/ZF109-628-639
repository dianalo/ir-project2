the software is already available for MS-DOS and the Apple Macintoshand now those with Sparc machines can fool around with it under Open Look,complete with sound - if they have $100 to spare; meantime Dux has integratedQuintet, its already integrated word processor, spreadsheet, database,graphing and communications package for Sparc-based machines, with a newMS-DOS version of the product, enabling a user working remotely on a personalcomputer to link dynamically with a Unix Sparcstation by phone or modem viaPC-NFS; Quintet, developed by the originator of both Supercalc and dBase,will soon have to change its name to Sextet - they're adding a sixth modulecalled Presentation.andM;- o -andM;University of California Extension, in Santa Cruz and Sony Microsystems Co,have opened a Unix workstation teaching laboratory and centre at Techmart,Santa Clara, California.andM;- o -andM;IBM and Desktop Data Inc of Waltham, Massachusetts, have signed aco-operative marketing agreement under which IBM is to market Desktop Data'sNewsEdge product line which comprises NewsEdge/LAN live news processing forlocal area networks, and NewsEdge/Server for electronic mail and executiveinformation system applications: there is also a joint product offering thatdelivers Desktop's news services via IBM's Executive Decisions/VM executivesupport system.andM;- o -andM;According to The Washington Post, US students now believe that it is moreimportant to know how to use computers than to understand just how they work,and the US Department of Education has released statistics that show thenumber of undergraduate degrees awarded in computers and information scienceshas dropped for the third consecutive year; the number of degrees awarded in1989 was 27% down on those awarded in the peak year of 1986 when 41,889computer science diplomas were distributed; experts blame the decline on alost love affair with personal computers.andM;- o -andM;Hewlett-Packard Co has been awarded a $15m contract to supply the SingaporeStock Exchange with 1,600 Unix workstations to will replace existing personalcomputers: there will be several hundred clusters, with HP Apollo 9000 Model425ts serving similar diskless models.andM;- o -andM;Motorola Inc's Radio-Telephone Systems Group and Qualcomm Inc have signed anagreement to explore and develop radio telephony products using CDMA, CodeDivision Multiple Access, technology: CDMA is one of several technologiesunder investigation in the US for use in cellular networks, and thedevelopment programme will evaluate its potential to enhance capacity,currently a problem for cellular operators; up to now, Motorola has used TimeDivision Multiple Access system.andM;- o -andM;Oki Semiconductor based in Sunnyvale, California has announced availabilityof its nX family of microcontrollers: the 8-bit and 16-bit CMOSmicrocontrollers offer speeds up to 200nS, and they have been enhanced byon-chip peripherals;

noprices were given for the product.andM;- o -andM;Euroserve Computing Ltd, the Bristol-based company that was formed in amanagement buyout from RTZ Corp (CI No 1,471), has been managing MPSISystems' 4381-based operations while the company developed and installed IBMRS6000 workstations to replace the older system: the transferral took 18hours and completed ahead of schedule.andM;- o -andM;Para Systems Inc, Carrollton, Texas, has introduced Network Manager U/X byMinuteman software designed to enable workstations and personal computersrunning Unix to interface with its Minuteman uninterruptible power supplies:the package monitors incoming AC power, detects when it is interrupted andbrings in alternative power supplies, notifies the user of the need to vacatethe system due to battery exhaustion - or initiates shutdown automatically;it sells for $140.andM;- o -andM;WordPerfect Corp, Orem, Utah says it will ship the implementation of itseponymous word processor for NeXT Computer Inc's machines this quarter: it issaid to have features comparable with WordPerfect 5.0 yet takes fulladvantage of the NeXTstep graphical user interface.andM;- o -andM;Danny Hillis, the thinking behind Thinking Machines Corp, Cambridge,Massachusetts forecasts that parallel supercomputing will progress so rapidlythat by the middle of the decade, conventional supercomputers will beobsolete: that fear has led not only Cray Research Inc but also ConvexComputer Corp to embark on massively parallel CPU development.andM;- o -andM;The European Parliament has passed a motion ordering Bull SA, Philips NV andIng C Olivetti andamp; Co SpA to suspend their planned redundancies until termshave been negotiated with employee representatives, and condemned &quot;the typesof restructuring that consist exclusively of massive lay-offs and plantclosures&quot;; since the European Parliament has no powers beyond refusing topass the Community budget, the vote was an exercise in futility.andM;- o -andM;The Carnegie Group Inc has announced that it has released the first phase ofthe Initiative for Managing Knowledge Assets Technology, and the software isnow in beta test: the software is being tested by the four other participantsin the Initiative - DEC, Ford Motor Company, Texas Instruments and US WestAdvanced Technologies Inc - and they are using it to develop knowledge-basedapplications; the Pittsburg, Pennsylvania-based Carnegie Group says it willlicense the new technology when the software is thoroughly beta tested.andM;- o -andM;Look for new models in Hewlett-Packard Co's mid-range HP 9000 Series 800Precision Architecture RISC Unix machines next month.andM;- o -andM;Kaypro Corp, which can't seem to make up its mind whether it lives in SanDiego or in Solana Beach these days, has something to celebrate for once: itexhibited at Comdex after a two year break, and reports that it took morethan $1m in orders for its personal computers at the show; it also reckons itfound several potential international channels in Central America, China andJapan and strengthened negotiations with mass marketers.andM;- o -andM;Elaborating on the need for a major new round of job cuts next year at Ing COlivetti andamp; Co SpA, chairman Carlo de Benedetti says that Italy is inrecession and that inflation will hit 13% next year: he said that the worldeconomic crisis would penalise the most indebted countries, one of which isItaly - &quot;Italy failed to use the eight years of continuous economic expansionto clean up its own public accounts,&quot; he told Milan daily paper Corrieredella Sera; 4,000 Olivetti jobs are to go in Italy.andM;- o -andM;Japanese Unix distributor Air Co Ltd, and MS-DOS-under-Unix specialist HunterSystems Inc, Palo Alto, California, have released Unix versions ofKanji-based MS-DOS applications, including Ashton-Tate's dBase III Plus andKanri-Kogaku's Matu Kanji word processor: they are available on Hitachi, NEC,Sony and Omron Unix machines;
