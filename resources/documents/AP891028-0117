Edward M. Kennedy,a strong supporter of economic sanctions against South Africa,questions the value of such sanctions against South African gold.   ``Even if enforcement were perfect, most sanctions against SouthAfrican gold might fail to generate substantial direct economicpressure,'' the General Accounting Office said in the report, whichwas released Saturday.   Kennedy, D-Mass., is a staunch opponent of South Africa'sapartheid system of racial segregation and supports additionalsanctions against South Africa. He had asked the GAO to investigatesanctions against gold and diamonds, both key exports from SouthAfrica.   The interim report released Saturday dealt only with gold.   In an accompanying press release, Kennedy characterized thereport as a ``significant breakthrough on the sanctions issue.''   Asked to reconcile that description with Kennedy's position onthe sanctions issue, an aide cited one section of the reportdealing with discovery by a Commerce Department scientist of teststhat can trace the country of origin of refined gold.   ``This technology gives us something we could not do before,''said Kennedy aide David Smith.   The report acknowledged that ``metals combined with gold injewelry manufacturing may render the test ineffective.''   Kennedy would like to add jewelry made of South African gold tothe list of gold items banned in this country. Most South Africangold enters the United States in the form of jewelry, mostly madein Italy, the report said. About $800 million to $900 million worthof that jewelry is imported into the United States annually.   Jewelry was excluded from a 1986 congressional ban in large partbecause it is difficult to establish the source of gold in importedjewelry, Kennedy's office said.   As for the critical look at gold sanctions in general, Smithsaid, ``We recognize both the porousness of sanctions and theirlimits.''   But he added that sanctions have political, symbolic, andpsychological effects such as lowering business confidence in theeconomy. He said sanctions are one weapon out of several in thefight against apartheid.   Imports of gold Krugerrands and bullion are already banned.Congressional opponents of apartheid, in addition to the jewelryban, are also mulling the idea of encouraging countries to releaseSouth African gold from their central banks and forcing investorsto divest all holdings in South African gold mining shares.   Throughout the report, however, the view of sanctions was gloomy.   ``Even if there were no smuggling and other nations began toadopt a ban on imports of bullion, South Africa could sell its goldto many alternative markets,'' the report said.   Gold accounts for 45 percent of South Africa's export earningsand 10 percent of its government tax revenues, the GAO report said.   ``Because the United States is the largest market for goldjewelry in the world and a customer for over 50 percent of Italy'sjewelry exports, it might be able to exert some leverage on jewelrymakers to use non-South African gold,'' the report said. ``Butbecause the boycott would be directed at imports fromjewelry-producing countries rather than directly at South Africangold bullion, some chance exists'' that the United States would beaccused of violating international free trade agreements.   If sanctions became so effective that mines began to close, ``itwould be difficult to reopen them in any post-apartheid society,''the report said, noting that the pressure of the earth on the deepmines would close them naturally.   On current bullion sanctions, it said: ``Because little goldbullion was imported into the United States directly from SouthAfrica prior to the ban and because knowledge of the boycott in thegold market was not widespread, the ban has had little actualimpact reducing South African gold revenues or on the world price.''   South Africa could legally avoid sanctions ``by developingalternative markets and might benefit from unintentionalspeculative price increases,'' the report said. ``Also, releasinggold (from central banks) might harm other gold-producing nationsat least in the short term'' by depressing prices.   Congress in 1986 banned imports of South African minerals,metals, farm goods and products from government-owned or controlledagencies.</TEXT></DOC>
