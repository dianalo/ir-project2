The source, speaking on condition of anonymity Thursday, did notsay whether a counsel had yet been hired to investigate thesenators, who aided Charles H. Keating Jr. when he was the chairmanof the failing Lincoln Savings and Loan of Irvine, Calif.   But the New York Times reported today the committee had decidedto hire prominent Washington attorney Robert S. Bennett for theinvestigation, as well as for an unrelated review involving Sen.Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y. A source says the Senate Ethics Committeeis reviewing allegations that D'Amato violated rules in theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development scandal.   Until now, the Ethics Committee's only known interest was aletter asking the five whether Keating's contributions _ $1.3million to the senators' campaigns or political causes _ promptedthem to question regulators about their examination of Lincoln.   The senators are Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; John McCain, R-Ariz., and DonaldRiegle, D-Mich. Cranston responded to the committee Thursday asDeConcini and Riegle did earlier, all denying any improprieties.Glenn and McCain have not yet filed formal responses but havedenied wrongdoing.   Also on Thursday, federal regulators handling the Lincoln Sandamp;Lfailure seized a luxury resort and a hotel in Arizona owned byKeating.   Bennett earlier this year was selected by the committee toinvestigate accusations that Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn.,laundered $100,000 in campaign contributions through a bookcontract.   The Ethics Committee does not formally announce a decision toproceed from an initial expression of interest to the first formalstage of a case known as a preliminary inquiry. The inquirydetermines whether there's a ``reason to believe'' rules violationsoccurred.   If the committee so decides, it would begin an initial review todetermine whether there is ``substantial credible evidence'' ofviolations.   The final step is a full investigation to decide if there is``clear and convincing evidence'' that standards were violated, andwhether discipline should be recommended to the Senate.   A standing Senate order says that Ethics Committeeinvestigations ``shall be conducted by outside counsel ... unlessthe select committee determines not to use outside counsel.''   The congressional watchdog Common Cause had urged the outsidecounsel so that the results of the inquiry would be credible andaccepted by the public.   Cranston, the Democratic whip, told the committee Thursday that``no further action ... is warranted,'' in a formal responseprepared by his attorney.   In an accompanying letter to committee Chairman Howell T.Heflin, D-Ala., and Vice Chairman Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H.,Cranston said his inquiries to the Federal Home Loan Bank Boardabout Lincoln were ``nothing more and nothing less'' than what hehas done for other constituents ``with credible complaints abouttheir treatment by a federal agency.''   ``I am not responsible for loss of taxpayer funds through adelay in shutting down Lincoln or the losses of innocent Californiabond investors,'' Cranston said.   Cranston's spokesman, Murray Flander, said he had no furthercomment on the decision to hire a counsel adding, ``We have nofirsthand knowledge of it.''   McCain's office issued a statement saying, ``I am confident thatan investigation will vindicate my repeated statements that I neverabused my office nor took actions that were improper.''   Riegle said today, ``I strongly support whatever level ofinquiry the Senate Ethics Committee feels is appropriate. Theirreview will show my conduct in this matter to have been ethical andproper at all times.''   DeConcini issued a statement saying, ``I welcome anything thatwill establish the facts and I will cooperate fully.''   Glenn's aide Dale Butland said in Columbus, Ohio, ``The senatorhas not been ntified of this.''   Cranston, McCain, DeConcini and Glenn met with then-Bank BoardChairman Edwin Gray on April 2, 1987, and all five senators met aweek later with regional officials from the board's San Franciscooffice about Lincoln.   Cranston also phoned Gray's successor, M. Danny Wall, lastspring endorsing Keating's failed attempt to sell Lincoln beforeregulators obtained a court order to seize it.   Regulators seized control of Lincoln only last April. Theyestimate taxpayers will have to cover between $2 billion and $2.5billion in federally insured deposits the thrift lost in thebiggest Sandamp;L failure in history. Regulators have filed a $1.1billion fraud and racketeering suit against Keating and hisassociates.   In addition, hundreds of the 22,000 bondholders who boughthigh-risk debentures in Lincoln's holding company, AmericanContinental Corp. of Phoenix, through Lincoln branches have suedKeating after losing an estimated $200 million.   In Arizona, the federal regulators, accompanied by FBI agents,local police and private security guards, took control of thePhoenician, a 605-room golf resort near Scottsdale, and the344-room Crescent Hotel in Phoenix.   Keating, his wife, Mary Elaine Keating, two daughters, twosons-in-law and 18 other associates were fired from managementpositions at the properties, owned by a subsidiary of LincolnSavings and Loan Association, Irvine, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
