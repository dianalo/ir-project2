DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal prosecutors say information gatheredfrom Ivan Boesky and others caught up in the snowballing WallStreet insider trading scandal led indirectly to unprecedentedstock manipulation charges against GAF Corp.   GAF, two subsidiaries and the corporation's vice chairman wereindicted on numerous securities law charges Wednesday for analleged scheme to manipulate the price of Union Carbide Corp.common stock.   GAF made an unsuccessful hostile takeover bid for Union Carbidein 1985 and kept alive the threat of another attempt until it soldmuch of its Carbide stake in late 1986.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said the indictment marked thefirst time ``a corporate entity was charged with stockmanipulation'' in the government's widening probe.   The 10-count indictment charged GAF, two subsidiaries _ GAFChemicals Corp. and Jay andamp; Company Inc. _ and James T. Sherwin,GAF's vice chairman and chief administrative officer withconspiracy, stock price manipulation, securities fraud, wire fraud,causing the creation of false brokerage records and obtainingimproper margin loans to finance stock purchases.   A spokesman for GAF, a Wayne, N.J.-based chemical and buildingproducts conglomerate, said the board of directors had expressedits full confidence in Sherwin as well as ``its deep disappointmentin the government's decision to bring these unprecedented charges.''   The spokesman said the company and Sherwin intended to defendthemselves vigorously against the charges and were ``confident ofcomplete vindication.''   The indictment alleged the stock price manipulation wasconducted through the Los Angeles-based brokerage firm of Jefferiesandamp; Co., which was not charged with any wrongdoing.   The company's founder, Boyd L. Jefferies, has been cooperatingwith investigators and pleaded guilty in March 1987 to two felonycharges arising from the Boesky insider trading scandal.   Jefferies, who faces a maximum 10-year prison term, has yet tobe sentenced.   ``Ivan Boesky's connection to this matter is indirect,'' saidGiuliani. ``Boesky cooperated and as a result of his cooperation wewere able to develop a case on Jefferies. Jefferies cooperated andamong other things he revealed this particular situation.''   Giuliani said Jefferies' cooperation and the investigation werecontinuing. He declined to say if additional indictments were inthe works.   The GAF indictment alleged that Sherwin, acting for GAF, had twounidentified Jefferies andamp; Co. employees make Union Carbide stockclose at or above a specified price over several days in lateOctober 1986.   According to Assistant U.S. Attorney Carl Loewenson Jr., theindictment charged Sherwin with plotting to drive up the price ofUnion Carbide's stock ``to attract buyers and to maximize theprofits'' GAF could earn by selling its Carbide stock.   The indictment further alleged that Sherwin promised GAF wouldpay Jefferies andamp; Co. for any losses the brokerage incurred on suchtrades. At the time, GAF owned nearly 10 million shares, or 10percent of Carbide's outstanding common shares.   Jefferies andamp; Co. bought large amounts of Carbide stock _ and lostmoney _ near the close of trading on Oct. 29 and 30, 1986. Theindictment contended that boosted the price of Carbide common stock.   The indictment said one of Sherwin's alleged co-conspirators atJefferies sent him a $40,000 invoice for fictitious advisoryservices. Sherwin allegedly approved payment of the invoice, andGAF made out a check payable to Jefferies andamp; Co.   On Nov. 10, 1986, GAF sold 5 million shares of Carbide stock toSalomon Brothers for nearly $115 million. Giuliani said SalomonBrothers cooperated with investigators.   According to the indictment, Sherwin never sent the $40,000 GAFcheck to Jefferies. After the news media reported that BoydJefferies, chairman of the brokerage, had been subpoenaed by theSecurities and Exchange Commission in the Boesky investigation,Sherwin allegedly instructed his secretary to void the $40,000check.   If convicted on all counts, Sherwin, 54, of Princeton, N.J.,faces a maximum 50 years in prison and up to $2.5 million in fines.The charges against corporate defendant carry maximum fines of upto $5 million each.</TEXT></DOC>
