They do not. The storeinvolved was Joey Franco PW Supermarkets at 1665 Foxworthy Ave., San Jose.  </MEMO><TEXT>     &quot;Really??!! Lucky is behind us!? Great!,&quot; said Gina Pappani, Nob Hill'sspokeswoman, after hearing the results of last week's Mercury News marketbasket survey.;     When prices of 46 food items were compared at a dozensupermarkets from Newark to Los Gatos, discount warehouse supermarkets Food 4Less and Pak 'N Save came out on top, as was expected, but Nob Hillsurprisingly challenged Lucky's low- price tag.;     The survey, conductedlast Wednesday p,8p9,8p,8p and Thursday, yielded some other unexpectedresults:;     (check) This survey's $83.57 average total reflects only a 2.2percent increase over last February's survey average. The U.S. 3p6 Departmentof Labor's food-at-home component of the Bay Area Consumer Price Index rose5.7 percent from January last year. Our 46-item shopping list was distilledfrom the same list used for the Consumer Price Index.;     (check) The marketbasket total at one high-end supermarket was almost a dollar less than thesame market basket at that store last year.;     (check) Cosentino's, anothermarket that pushes service and quality, had cheaper produce prices thandiscounter Pak 'N Save.;     All three events may be the result of heavycompetition in a market where food prices appear to be more stable than therest of the Bay Area, despite crop damage by cold weather and projections thatdrought conditions may further close fields to planting.;     &quot;To me it wouldbe a surprise if it was higher that 2 percent,&quot; said Mike Stuart, a vicepresident of the Western Growers Association, a trade group of fruit,vegetable and and nut growers in California and Arizona.;     &quot;Produce isbeing sold at less than what it costs to produce it. You could make theargument that there should be reductions in fruit and vegetable area,&quot; hesaid.;     Here's how the supermarkets fared in the survey. The second figureshows the increase over last year's totals.;     (check) Food 4 Less, 39966Cedar Blvd., Duffel Plaza, Newark, $73.23; up 1.6 percent.;     (check) Pak 'NSave, 4950 Almaden Expressway, San Jose, $76.54; up 3 percent.;     (check)Nob Hill, 1581 W. Campbell Ave., Campbell, $79.66; up 0.9 percent.;    (check) Lucky Stores, 1675 Tully Road, San Jose, $80.09; up 3.5 percent (froman Alpha Beta store that was converted to a Lucky store just before the 1990survey) and up 5.2 percent (from an original Lucky store surveyed last year.);    (check) Safeway Stores Inc., 1731 W. San Carlos Ave., San Jose, $81.90; up5.3 percent.;     (check) Fry's Food and Drug Stores, 1965 Foxworthy Ave., SanJose, $82.11; up 3.4 percent;     (check) Joey Franco PW Supermarkets, 1665Foxworthy Ave., San Jose, $84.66; up 4.1 percent.;     (check) Cosentino'sVegetable Haven Inc., 2666 S. Bascom Ave., San Jose, $84.80; up 1.2 percent.;    (check) Zanotto's Markets, 1970 Naglee Ave., San Jose, $86.45; up 1.9percent.;     (check) Petrini's Market, 1610 S. Saratoga-Sunnyvale Road, SanJose, $86.54; up 1.4 percent.;     (check) Draeger's Supermarket, 1010University Drive, Menlo Park, $91.75; down 1 percent.;     (check) Lunardi'sMarkets, 720 Blossom Hill Road, Los Gatos, $95.11; up 3.8 percent.;     Forthree consecutive surveys, Food 4 Less has topped the chart. Nob Hill, aconsistent price leader in the produce category, became more competitive inother areas as evidenced by a market basket total that only the discountwarehouses could best.;     &quot;It's really competitive in the whole area. Wehave friends with stores in Antioch and other areas and it's just not quite ascompetitive as it is here,&quot; said Stan Rebello, one of three brothers who ownand operate Rebco Food Inc., the Newark-based parent of Food 4 Less stores.;    The discount warehouse supermarkets keep prices low by shipping direct tothe store thereby cutting out the cost of storage elsewhere.;     Nob Hillshoppers are being flagged on all sides by items that wave price reductiontags designed to get their attention.;     &quot;We have taken thousands of itemsand reduced their prices. We've been in the process for the last two to threemonths and we aren't finished yet,&quot; said Pappani, who wouldn't reveal just howmany prices will eventually come down. The chain has 25 stores in NorthernCalifornia.;     With 12 stores in Santa Clara County, it not only is takingon supermarket giants but also considers discount warehouse markets fairgame.;     &quot;You have warehouse stores and with the present economy, customersare looking at prices and value and that's something we needed to address. Andwe are not going to compromise quality. We want to maintain an issue ofquality,&quot; Pappani said.;     Lucky has kept a wary eye on Nob Hill and isn'tabout to take the tough competitor lightly.;     &quot;We look at competitors allthe time to make sure we do maintain low price leadership. We've been doingthat for 25 years. We would look at them regardless of how they positionthemselves,&quot; said Lucky spokeswoman Judy Decker.;     Since 1988, whenAmerican Stores purchased the Lucky chain and eventually abandoned the AlphaBeta name, such toughness has caused a crunch in the supermarket business.Safeway Stores Inc. recently offered home grocery deliveries to round up morecustomers. A Canadian food retailer, Provigo Inc., pared down its Petrini'schain to just a few stores. Handamp;S Food Villa and Micali's Food Villa werescratched from the survey this year because they no longer represent chainsupermarkets. Both Food Villa chains dropped all but one of their outlets,effectively eliminating them from the chain wars.;     Still, this is asupermarket-dense area. Sacramento-based Raley's Supermarkets has moved intothe South Bay with stores in Newark and Fremont, and Rebello said another Food4 Less warehouse supermarket will open in San Jose this year.;     In oneexample, the half-mile stretch of Saratoga Avenue from San Tomas Expressway inSanta Clara to Campbell Avenue at the San Jose-Saratoga border contains threeLucky stores, two major ethnic supermarkets and several smaller mom-and-popgroceries and franchise convenience stores. A similar density of marketsexists in the Foxworthy-Union Avenue area South San Jose where Fry's, PWSupermarkets and Cosentino's compete.;     Despite the economy, crop damageand the looming effects of five years of drought, this competition may bewhat's helping to keep market basket survey prices down in Santa ClaraCounty.;     Regionally, food prices have increased 5.7 percent in the lastyear, according to Department of Labor statistics. Those statistics reflect asurvey of 975 items at about 650 markets in 10 Bay Area counties.;     Whilethe gap between the least expensive market basket and the most expensive was$21.88, many market basket totals are just pennies apart.;     &quot;If thedifference is within a dollar or so, I wouldn't really consider itsignificant. If you happen to pick one item on special discount in one storeand if it's especially higher in another, that makes all the difference,&quot; saidprofessional shopper Roger Hunter, who helped conduct the survey.;     Eventhe glitzy Draeger's Supermarket, which typically places at the high end ofthe survey, is trying to get into the low-price act. Though it sometimesoffers so much service that the help clogs the aisles, Draeger's market baskettotal was 90 cents less than last year's.;     &quot;That's great. This is bearingout the fact that we have competitively priced ourselves with who we arecompeting with, which is good. Essentially, our pricing philosophy has been toprice competitively against Safeway with our national brands,&quot; said RichardDraeger, owner of the stores.;  GROCERY BAG CHECK;   Mercury News Staff WriterBroderick Perkins and professional shopper Roger Hunter, the Butler, fromSunnyvale, surveyed prices at 16 South Bay supermarkets on March 1 and 2.
