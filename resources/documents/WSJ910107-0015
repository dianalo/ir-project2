This view emerges from interviews with foreign diplomatsfollowing the first public announcement of jail sentencestied to the Tiananmen demonstration, and during conversationswith a variety of Chinese people over the past couple ofmonths.</LP><TEXT>   On Saturday, China's official news agency said sevenprotesters -- including four student activists: ZhengXuguang, Ma Shaofang, Zhang Ming and Wang Youcai -- receivedsentences ranging from two to four years for such crimes asinciting public disorder and interfering in the enforcementof martial law. At the same time, two other protesters whoexpressed remorse were released without punishment.   These sentences are considered light for China, whichtraditionally hands out jail terms of 10 years or more topeople convicted of anti-government activities. Diplomats saythat Saturday's announcement indicates that China may betrying to respond to human-rights complaints from America andEurope.   But diplomats say that foreign governments will remainskeptical of China's attitude until sentences are handed downfor older intellectuals and prominent student leaders accusedof being &quot;black hands&quot; behind the rebellion. This wouldinclude such people as Wang Dan, 25, a Beijing Universitystudent leader; Liu Xiaobo, 34, a university lecturer whoreturned from Columbia University to join the movement; BaoTong, 57, a senior adviser to ousted party Secretary-GeneralZhao Ziyang; and Wang Juntao, 32, a longtime democracyactivist and magazine editor.   &quot;If they are given lenient sentences, that would besignificant,&quot; says one Western diplomat. &quot;It would be thesort of thing that would demand response from westerncountries.&quot;   Domestically, lenient sentences probably would have littleimpact. Since troops opened fire on demonstrators on June 4,1989, China has kept its disgruntled population in check byusing a combination of scare tactics and financial subsidies.But the leadership has been too divided to come up with apositive way to rebuild the Communist Party's credibility.   As a result, many Chinese say it will take nothing lessthan the ouster of one or more top leaders to convince peoplethat the government has genuinely good intentions and wantsto do more than retain power.   This despair is evident on China's campuses, wherestudents are constantly watched but still commit small actsof defiance. At some schools, students now engage in &quot;desktopliterature&quot; in which they carve or write sarcastic slogans ontheir desks. Last week, at Chinese People's University here,one student was beaming over his newest creation: &quot;People'sUniversity Entrance Requirements: have parents who are seniorcadre and the ability to learn how to be thoroughly corrupt.&quot;   A law student at Beijing University next door says: &quot;Thereare spies everywhere monitoring what we do. Everybody justwants to leave China and go overseas to study. We all feelhopeless.&quot;   At hotels throughout China, the special privilege andcorruption that demonstrators railed against last year isstill on display. The party closed its special grocery storethat was reserved for senior leaders. But outside Beijing'sfive-star hotels, many of which are owned by the military orpublic security agencies, chauffeured limousines line upevery day waiting for party and government leaders to emergefrom lavish banquets.   At the Zhongshan Hotel in the gritty northeasternindustrial city of Shenyang, the main restaurant at noon oneday in mid-November is filled with military officers andpolicemen who are spending the average worker's weekly wagefor a meal. Idle factory workers gather in a rundown noodleshop down the street. More than half of China's statefactories are losing money. Those that have closed continueto give workers their basic salaries to stave off unrest, buteven so, boredom is taking its toll. &quot;I'm real tired ofhaving nothing to do,&quot; says a 36-year-old worker as he smokescigarettes and stares out the shop window.   A 40-year-old military scientist from south China wonderswhether he will ever enjoy success. &quot;Does my generation alsohave to waste its life waiting for China to become a rationalplace? We can't use our skills because the cadres above usare threatened by anybody who is smarter or more skilled thanthey are.&quot;   Premier Li Peng and party chief Jiang Zemin have been allover the map trying to raise enthusiasm for the governmentand party. At first the line was to be obedient or Chinacould descend into chaos reminiscent of the CulturalRevolution. Then they tried to rally the country to embrace&quot;Asian Games Spirit&quot; after China cleaned up on medals at theSeptember Asian Games here.   The latest line was issued Dec. 30 when party leadersapproved a confusing five-year plan that both embraces pastcapitalist reforms and extols &quot;the universal truth ofMarxism.&quot; It also instructs to study Mao Tse-tung's thoughtand Marxism-Leninism &quot;to re-energize the national spirit.&quot;   A few days later, at Beijing's largest bookstore, thepolitics and social studies section prominently displays the51 volumes of Lenin's works along with Engles, Stalin, Maoand a large selection from Deng Xiaoping. The few peoplewandering into this section, however, migrate to a shelf thatcarries such titles as &quot;Relations between Men and Women&quot; and&quot;How to Improve Your Family Life.&quot; Asked who buys thepolitical books, a clerk says: &quot;The people who buy thosebooks are the people who have to buy those books.&quot;   At the ancient Confucius Temple a few miles north, anexhibit displays life-sized statues that depict Kuomintangagents and their American advisers performing such torturesas peeling the skin off communists in the 1940s. High schooland middle school students, who are being tested on theexhibit, wander through taking notes.   &quot;All of us have to go see this; we think it's prettyweird,&quot; say a high school girl. &quot;I guess they are trying toteach us to hate the Americans.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
