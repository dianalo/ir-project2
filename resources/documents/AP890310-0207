Closing the highways has been a favorite rebel tactic in the9-year-old civil war. The bans virtually paralyze vehicle traffic,the principal means of transportation in this Central Americannation, and the rebels enforce them by shooting up or firebombingtrucks, cars or buses found on the roads.   Venceremos, the clandestine rebel radio, said the ban would startat midnight Wednesday and continue until further notice.   It said the purpose was to reinforce ``public sentiment againstthe March 19 election.''   Five traffic bans were declared last year, including one tosupport a boycott of legislative and municipal elections. Armytrucks with soldiers riding shotgun were used in some areas to takepeople to the polls.   The rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance won a majority inthe national legislature in the elections last March and itscandidate, businessman and coffee grower Alfredo Christiani, isfavored to win this one.   Christiani is running against Christian Democratic candidateFidel Chavez, a lawyer and former foreign minister, and GuillermoUngo of the Democratic Convergence, a coalition of non-combatantleftist groups.   A few hours before the traffic ban was announced, President JoseNapoleon Duarte blamed the rebel Faribundo Marti National LiberationFront for a delay in negotiations to end the war.   Duarte's Christian Democratic administration rejected a Jan. 24proposal by the rebels to begin talks if the election was postponeduntil at least September and their conditions for security and aclean vote were met.   He accused the guerrillas of ``rejecting dialogue'' and resortingto ``delay and deceit.''   ``Their strategy is to create conditions that will gain thempoints internationally and nationally, with proposals of peace thatthey do not want to honor,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
