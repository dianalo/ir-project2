There, in complete safety, a fish gets first-class accommodationsfor several weeks, his only chore being to perform taste tests for afellow who appreciates fish.   ``It's like taking them to Baskin-Robbins,'' said Jones. ``We askthem to tell us which samples they don't like, which ones they likeand which ones they really like. There's no stress, we keep themwell fed and the water clean. They don't live a bad life.''   There's a sinister motive, though, from a fish's point of view.Jones is a fish biologist for Berkley Inc. of Spirit Lake, whichmakes fishing lures. His job is to isolate the chemicals that fishidentify as food, and then make them into lures.   ``I'm somewhat of a unique species,'' he said. ``I don't know ofa single other fishing lure company that has a fish biologist onstaff.''   He also has discovered that fish do not necessarily like arepugnant bait.   ``There's a mistaken impression that the stinkier the bait, thebetter. That's a gross error. That's not how it works. The chemicalsthat catfish rely on as a signal for food has nothing to do with howstinky it is,'' he said.   Some stinky baits, like old cheese, do contain elements that arequite appetizing for catfish, ``but it doesn't contain very much ofthem, and the part that does is probably not the stinky part.''   The fish tests are simple.   ``You take little cotton pellets, the same as you would find in adentist's office. By themselves, they're neutral. Fish neither likethem nor dislike them.   ``If you put one in water, a rainbow trout might attack it. Onceinside the mouth, the next thing that happens depends on what thefish perceives it to be. If he's neutral towards it or doesn't likeit, he spits it out in a split second. If he likes it, he might mullit over, chew it up and then spit it out. The ones they really like,they'll go ahead and swallow.   ``The cotton doesn't hurt the fish. It's just like a high fiberdiet.''   He said he has isolated some tasty chemicals for several species.The substances are marketed either in a liquid that is dropped onthe lure or as a putty-like glob that becomes the lure itself.   There is still years of work, however, to identify all of thechemicals that fish interpret to be food, but theoretically, theperfect lure would put the beginning fisherman on the same plateauwith the pro.   ``We haven't quite reached that level yet,'' Jones said. ``Wehave a standard joke around here, if you want to improve the fish'sodds, try fishing with one arm tied behind your back, or use abarbless hook.''</TEXT></DOC>
