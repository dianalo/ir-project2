to users'word processing needs.andM;But a growing number of scientists and engineers in the federal governmentbelieve the description may be an apt one for the T3 (pronounced &quot;T-cubed&quot;)Scientific Word Processing System from TCI Software Research Inc. of LasCruces, N.M.andM;Until recently, software companies have offered technical writers two basicsolutions to their unique word processing demands, which include manynon-standard character sets, fonts and formatting requirements for creatingcomplex scientific, engineering and mathematical expressions.andM;The computing world is glutted with conventional word processors that enablescientists to produce professional text documents, yet most provide onlymeager graphics capabilities.andM;Other software packages -- more typesetting programs than word processors --offer technical writers graphics and formatting tools for buildingexpressions.andP;  Typically these packages are painfully hard to learn for anyonebut a full-time typesetter.andM;Consequently, many scientists and engineers have had little choice but firstto compose their text with conventional word processors and then add anychemical formulas, scientific equations or mathematical expressions by handor with separate typesetting or graphics packages.andM;For hundreds of government scientists from a wide range of federal offices --including the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the AgricultureDepartment, the U.S.andP;  Information Agency, the Defense Department andintelligence agencies -- T3 seems to represent the closest thing to a 100percent technical word processing solution available today.andM;The recent Version 2.2 of T3 provides users a full range of professional wordprocessing capabilities, including a built-in spelling checker with adictionary of 80,000 words, &quot;close word&quot; query and wild-card search features,typeset-quality proportional spacing, extended ASCII import and exportcapability and even an option to print footnotes as endnotes.andM;Features AddedandM;New features of Version 2.2 include a merge-print facility that allows usersto insert into T3 business documents data and text from database programs.andM;But T3's real power is in its impressive repertoire of technical wordprocessing tools.andP;  Federal users target most of their praise on thereliability of T3 to produce from the screen &quot;what-you-see-is-what-you-get&quot;(WYSIWYG) hard copy.andM;Robert McGraw, senior scientist at the National Solar Observatory inAlamagordo, N.M., chose T3 after having experimented with numerous wordprocessors, such as Elan Computer Group's EROFF and the Tex formatterdeveloped by Donald Knuth at Stanford University.andP;  &quot;Whereas EROFF producedequations so small that you couldn't see them clearly,&quot; McGraw said, &quot;withT3, what you see is always what you get.&quot;andM;Although not 100 percent WYSIWYG, T3's display is surprisingly accurate inrepresenting expressing to scale, a feat not often matched by manyretrofitted word processors.andM;Whereas T3 enables users to create expressions and text in a singleoperation, other word processors, including Microsoft's Word and LifetreeSoftware's Total Word, force users to toggle back and forth between wordprocessing and graphics operations.andM;Some pseudo-technical word processors, including PCTex from Personal Tex, aremore typesetting programs than scientific word processors and they requirethat users embed in the text complex lengthy formatting commands whenconstructing expressions.andM;This often means that the user does not see the figure until it is printed,which can result in the user spending hours to revise tangled formattingcommands.andM;With T3, users can construct complex expressions within their documents byusing the software's more than 1,000 predefined key sequences, or by creatingtheir own expressions with the program's &quot;key sequence,&quot; or macro, facility.andM;T3's Diversity HailedandM;It was T3's diverse array of available character sets that drew the attentionof Dave Moore, president of Annapolis, Md.-based Peabody and Moore Inc., acomputing contractor to the federal government.andM;T3 includes 40 predefined font sets and 20 keyboard layouts, eight of whichcan be accessed by users during an editing session.andP;  Moore uses T3 forperforming translations of Russian-to-English text.andM;&quot;I tried the other so-called technical word processors and really hatedthem,&quot; Moore said.andP;  &quot;They were extremely difficult to learn and use, and whattheir displays made you think you were going to get was not what you ended upwith.&quot;andM;Available T3 keyboards support such languages as Greek, Polish and Russian.andO;Users also can create an unlimited number of unique keyboards by borrowingcharacters from existing T3 keyboards or by building characters bit by bitusing the software's font editor.andP;  With this, users have created newkeyboards for such languages as Hebrew and Navajo.andM;Version 2.2 also offers a &quot;dead key&quot; capability that enables users to defineunused keys for special typing functions such as accented foreign charactersor reoccurring macros that build scientific expressions.andM;Kathleen Albers, of TCI's technical support and marketing office, summarizedT3's selling points.andP;  &quot;If I had to sum up T3's strengths in 25 words or less,it would be the software's language sets, its extensive macro library and theflexibility it offers users in editing not only text but also scientific andmathematical figures,&quot; she said.andM;Tools Need at Least 640KandM;Such flexibility in building non-standard characters, fonts and expressionformats not only increases the range of applications for which T3 can beapplied but also enhances users' productivity.andP;  Dr. Jack Levedahl, assistantdirector for technical research at the Navy's David Taylor Research Center inAnnapolis, Md., previously produced all his scientific visuals by hand.andM;&quot;I regularly evaluate and report on more than 100 different technologies forthe Navy,&quot; Levedahl said.andP;  &quot;Most of the reports contain numerous fonts,different characters sets, scientific symbols and equations having as many as200 characters.andP;  None of this would be possible without T3.&quot;andM;T3 runs on any IBM or IBM-compatible PC operating a 2.0 or higher version ofDOS.andP;  Although T3 can run on less than 640K of RAM, TCI officials warned thata PC with less than 640K would deprive users of many onboard font andcharacter set tools.andM;The software supports up to 25 printers, but all federal T3 users interviewedrelied on laser jet printers to take advantage of T3's special fonts,typefaces and formatting capabilities.andM;Although T3 is not the fastest technical word processor on the market, noneof the users interviewed considered the absence of lightning processing speeda problem.andM;Besides, as Roger Hunter, vice president of TCI, points out, the IBM orIBM-compatible PC environment would restrict the operating speed of anyprogram the size and complexity of T3, which requires at least 3M ofhard-disk storage.andP;  While the memory requirement may raise the eyebrows ofsome users, the Navy's Levedahl dismissed T3's memory demands asinsignificant.andM;&quot;I can't imagine any scientist who's interested in performing seriouslytechnical word processing -- especially with the low cost of hard disks today-- having any less than a 20M hard disk,&quot; Levedahl said.andP;  &quot;The 3M storagerequirement just isn't a relevant concern.&quot;andM;Although federal users compliment T3 as a relatively easy-to-learn package,using the TCI software presents a vastly different keystroking approach fromother word processors.andP;  Whereas the function and keystroking sequences forfunction and cursor control keys of most word processors, such as WordStarand Word, often are defined arbitrarily, T3 key functions are assignedlogically, said TCI's Hunter.andM;Hunter said T3's &quot;chording&quot; concept of keystroking is coordinated to matchthe right key sequence with the logic function, thus shortening learning timefor even novice users.andM;Logical Keystroke PatternandM;For example, holding down the cursor-right key and then typing any lettermoves the cursor to the next occurrence of that letter.andP;  Holding down thedelete key and pressing the bar key deletes the next word, just as holdingdown the delete key and hitting a return key deletes the entire line.andM;Each of T3's 10 function keys retains its function and remains operationalregardless of where the user is in the program.andP;  The Menu function key, forexample, provides the Main Menu or a relevant submenu for most operations,whether the user is beginning the session or is performing an operation deepin the program.andM;At $595, T3 is priced at the high end for word processors.andP;  TCI expects soonto offer a version of T3 for the IBM OS/2 operating system and the AppleComputer Inc. Macintosh II, with PC emulation.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
