 But therewas a note of moderation in the salary increases top executives approved forthemselves, telling us, perhaps, that the concept of pay-for-performance maybe catching on.andP;  In several highly visible instances, compensation droppedsome because bonuses were tied to revenue gains that fell short of theprevious year's increase.andM;On average, the 99 chief executives in our annual salary survey got raises of14% last year.andP;  That's down substantially from the 22% average increase werecorded for 1988, although the numbers aren't strictly comparable becauseour universe consists of companies that make up the Technologic ComputerIndex, which changes a bit from year to year.andP;  Average compensation for CEOsof the current index companies, including salary and bonus but not countingstock options or gains on sales of company securities, was $522,000 lastyear.andP;  The moderate pay increases came despite an average 35% gain inrevenues.andM;John Sculley of Apple Computer, who continues to lead the industry in totalcompensation, set the tone by accepting a 9% cut to $2.25 million.andP;  Apple's30% growth last year, while admirable, was far short of the 53% revenueincrease in 1988, and Mr. Sculley's bonus suffered.andP;  Runner-up Rod Canion ofCompaq drew a 13% increase to $2.12 million.andP;  Other companies were moregenerous.andP;  Computer Associates gave Charles Wang a 37% boost to $1.96million, while Oracle's Larry Ellison moved from sixth on our list last yearto fourth, behind Mr. Wang, with a 27% increase to $1.73 million.andM;Not everyone settled for such modest raises.andP;  Maxtor's George Scalise got thebiggest increase, a 217% bump to just over $1 million.andP;  Finis Conner wasright behind with a 177% boost to $704,000 as Conner Peripherals stormedthrough a truly incredible growth year.andP;  The company's sales grew 174% to$705 million, making it the fastest growing startup Silicon Valley has everseen.andP;  By contrast, Irving Gould's compensation was up 150% to $1.25 millionalthough Commodore grew only 8% last year.andM;Where the money isandM;The place to be, for executives in search of monetary reward, seems to be thepersonal computer business.andP;  Skewed by the seven-digit numbers recorded byMessrs.andP;  Sculley, Canion and Gould, the average compensation forsmall-systems chief executives last year was an impressive $998,000.andO;Removing those curve-raisers, however, reveals a more representative averageof $473,000.andM;Compensation at hardware companies generally outpaced the other industrygroups we follow.andP;  Among large-systems companies the leading money earnerwas, not unexpectedly, IBM's John Akers.andP;  His pay of $1.42 million, down 7%from 1988, ranked sixth on our survey list and lifted the average for thatsegment to $781,000.andP;  CEOs at mid-range systems companies, led by John Youngof Hewlett-Packard, averaged $814,000 last year.andM;Join the clubandM;Although two software executives, Mr. Ellison and Mr. Wang, were in themillion-dollar club last year, the average CEO of a software company madeabout half the amount required for entry.andP;  Jim Manzi of Lotus Developmenttried to join, but his 80% raise to $991,000 left him a bit short.andM;We've remarked in the past on the frequent disparity between size of companyand size of salary.andP;  In the chip business, there seems to be almost aninverse relationship between the two.andP;  Thus we find Joe Parkinson paid $1.04million for running Micron Technology, a $446 million company, and JerryJunkins getting $702,000 at Texas Instruments, a $6.5 billion giant.andM;Down and outandM;It's also difficult to find a correlation between stock performance andsalary adjustments, although we have no doubt that in the long run the personrunning a problem company will lose more than a few dollars of compensation.andO;We note, for example, that both Ed Esber of Ashton-Tate and Bruce Smith ofNetwork Equipment Technologies have departed troubled scenes after absorbingpay cuts.andM;Our survey shows any number of cases where substantial salary increasesaccompany steep declines in the value of the stock.andP;  We even spotted a fewexamples, like that of Andy Grove at intel, where the CEO took a pay cutdespite an improvement in the stock price.andP;  Of course, 1989 was a wretchedyear for most technology stocks, and a lot of them recovered sharply in thefirst half of 1990.andP;  None of which had a lot to do with the brilliance orincompetence with which the companies were managed.andM;Looking good on paperandM;Our reluctance to start calculating individual equity gains and lossessubstantially understates the paper financial rewards that go to someentrepreneurs in this business.andP;  The most obvious example is Bill Gates, whodrew only $191,000 in salary last year but whose 46 million Microsoft sharesnow are worth $2.9 billion, an increase of $1.7 billion in the past year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
