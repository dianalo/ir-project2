<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-40-0451 </DOCNO><TEXT>A comprehensive review of computer hardware to satisfy the requirementsfor a hand held and battery powered computer suitable for use in thefield by geologists and engineers has been conducted. This review selecteda unit weighing little over 1 kilogram, and which is rugged enough tofall off an underground or surface vehicle and survive even when accidentallyimmersed in water. The unit can display 8 lines of 40 characters - anessential requirement in the construction of, and data entry to, mostgeological logging sheets. A suite of software programs has been writtento provide the user with the capability of creating his own electronicnotebook by structuring data input to the computer in a similar manneras is now done on pre-printed forms. The user can store all valid entrycodes or numeric ranges in a dictionary and all data inputs are validatedagainst this dictionary. This construction requires no knoweldge on thepart of the geologist or engineer of computer programming or operationbeyond simple menu style data entry. Once constructed the user may callthe electronic logsheet into the unit and collect data which will bestored into the unit which has a memory capacity to record data for periodsup to 60 hours. The data can then be automatically transferred to mini/microcomputersfor immediate analysis and report generation. 6 refs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
