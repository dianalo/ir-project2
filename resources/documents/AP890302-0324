The union said the company offer was an improvement but stillcalled for pay cuts rather than pay hikes, and strike preparationswere continuing. Further talks also were expected, mediators said.   Eastern pilots, meanwhile, rejected a separate company offerdesigned to keep them from staging a sympathy strike with theMachinists. Both the pilots and flight attendants said they wouldrefuse to cross picket lines if a strike is called after the end ofa federally imposed cooling-off Friday night.   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said all union workers shouldhonor Machinist picket lines, which other union officials have saidcould be put up at other airlines and transportation companies inaddition to Eastern.   Kirkland accused Frank Lorenzo, owner of Texas Air Corp. which isEastern's parent company, of ``finding it worth his while topurchase a good company and strip its assets, rather than operate itfairly and decently.''   Kirkland asked President Bush to follow a National MediationBoard request and call a special panel that would delay a strike for60 days.   Bush plans to meet with top advisers on the situation on Friday.   Eastern opposes presidential action, saying it is losing $1million a day and can't afford delay in making salary cuts it hasproposed. It had originally asked $150 million in cuts, but unionofficial Wally Haber in Miami said the new offer was less stringent.   ``The company is still looking for major concessions, but it'snot $150 million,'' Haber said.   The union has been asking for $50 million in raises.   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said a letter to Bush signed by athird of the Senate urged him to step in, noting that Eastern serves102 cities throughout North and South America, with 60 U.S. citiesin 27 states dependent on the airline for passenger and freightservice.   ``Any interruption in this service will result in a majordisruptin of interstate commerce,'' the letter said.   Kennedy noted that no president has ever refused to act on amediation board recommendation to call a special panel.   Eastern said its new offer would give mechanics a pay reductionthat still keeps their salaries 13 percent higher than all otheremployees who took a 20 percent pay cut when Lorenzo took over thecompany in 1986. It said baggage handlers would receive no greatercuts than other employees.   The company said the offer would give 8,500 mechanics, baggagehandlers and other ground workers five years of job security and``provides a strong financial incentive for Eastern to grow andavoid further downsizing to cope with its financial difficulties.''   ``We've been seeking a negotiated settlement all along andanything that moves us in that direction is welcome and we remainhopeful we can work out a negotiated agreement prior to the midnightdeadline,'' said airline spokesman Robin Matell in Miami.   Union president William Winpisinger, who was not participating inthe talks, said he had not heard of any new offer, but added, ``Ifthere's movement indicated, maybe there's a possibility we'll get itsettled.''   Walter C. Wallace, National Mediation Board chairman, announcedthat a new offer was made in talks Thursday but declined to saywhich side made it.   ``There has been action that hopefully might be the kind ofbreakthrough we are looking for. There's been some movement,''Wallace said.   He said the parties were evaluating the offer and would meetseparately later with board mediators in hopes of reaching asettlement in the 17-month dispute.   ``We are assured by both sides that they want to reach asettlement,'' Wallace told a news conference.   Wallace said it would be possible for the union and the airlineto ``stop the clock'' if negotiations continued past Friday midnight.   Eastern's 3,500 pilots, meanwhile, who were wooed ardently bymanagement hoping they will not cross Machinists' picket lines,rejected an Eastern proposal the company said included sweetened payand other promises.   ``The company's proposal, and the manner in which they have sentit forth proves to us that management is not interested in anyearnest efforts to resolve the current labor situation at Eastern,''said John J. Bavis, chairman of the Eastern Air Lines Pilots' masterexecutive council. Bavis called the offer ``a public relationsgimmick.''   The threatened strike has sent travelers scrambling for othercarriers, and Lorenzo warned a sympathy walkout by pilots could burythe 60-year-old company ``in the corporate graveyard.''   Mechanics have been taking home personal equipment boxes andtools, fearing they might be locked out before the strike. Wearingred union T-shirts, Machinists were handing leaflets to travelers atMiami International Airport.   The union contends its members can picket any transportationcompany covered by the Railway Labor Act, which includes airlines,railroads and some shipping concerns. The parent union, theInternational Association of Machinists, has been seeking an orderfrom a federal judge in Washington clarifying the union's strikerights under that law.   Other airlines contend their Machinists and fellow airlineworkers would be violating no-strike clauses in their contracts ifthey honored picket lines set up by Eastern strikers.   Northwest, United Airlines, USAir and Piedmont Airlines all havesued to block potential job actions by their Machinists.   Eastern said it will continue flying during a strike, althoughcompany officials refused to disclose contingency plans. The companypromised passengers would be re-routed or given refunds on anycanceled flights, but ticket agents reported a surge in sales atEastern competitors.   Some carriers have stopped short of promising to honor allEastern tickets, fearing the company could declare bankruptcy.</TEXT></DOC>
