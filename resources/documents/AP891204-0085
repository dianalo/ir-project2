Secondly, unification should occur in the context ofGermany's continued commitment to NATO, an increasingly integratedEuropean Community, and with due regard for the legal role andresponsibilities of the Allied powers. Third, in the interest ofgeneral European stability, moves toward unification must bepeaceful, gradual, and part of a step-by-step basis. And these were_ and lastly, on the question of borders, we should reiterate oursupport for the principles of the Helsinki Final Act.   So, I am not trying to accelerate that process. I don't thinkour allies are. I think Chancellor Kohl feels comfortable with thefour points I have just read. And so I think it's better to letthings move on their own and without the United States certainlysetting some kind of deadline.   Q. Mr. President, you said, in announcing your meeting withChairman Gorbachev, that one of the main reasons was that youwanted to make sure that, in this time of change, you didn't missanything. In your two days of meetings, did you learn anything thatyou fear, or feel, that you might have missed, had you not had this?   A. Yes. What I would have missed is I wouldn't see quite asclearly his priorities. I see them more clearly because he and Isat down and talked. We had about eight hours of talks _ someprivate. And I feel I can sense much more clearly the things hefeels more strongly about. And we had a good chance to point out tohim some of the difficulties with our relationship. It wasn't allsweetness and light. I had a very _ very good opportunity to tellhim how we view the _ our problems in our own hemisphere: thesending of arms in there to help the FMLN, and the role that _unhelpful role _ that Cuba is playing.   I recited in detail the Oscar Arias phone call to me: ``Pleaseraise with Mr. Gorbachev the unhelpful role, the destructive roleof Cuba.'' So I think it's more emphasis, although we did putforward some general themes on the economy. And I think he waspleased, because I think from his standpoint _ and this isimportant from mine _ he now sees that we want to have acooperative, forward-leaning relationship with the Soviet Union.   Q. Mr. President, you have, perhaps more than any contemporaryAmerican president, exercised personal diplomacy, establishingpersonal friendships with a wide variety of leaders. Are youprepared now to say that Mr. Gorbachev is your friend?   A. I'll say this: We had a very friendly _ conversations, andthen once in a while there were _ a little tension there. But itwas extraordinarily friendly in the conversation aspect. I don'tknow how you go further than that in definition. But I'm convincedthat he is determined to do that's what _ that what he told me he'sdoing _ reform, perestroika. Openness _ we totally agree on is ademocratic value. So, Brit, what happened was, I think he took mymeasure and I took his, and I think we just feel more comfortableabout our common objectives.   Yeah, John?   Q. I want to go back to what Helen asked you about. You saidthat you had made an Atlantic policy. ...   A. Keep talking _ I'm just _ going to get some water.   Q. After World War II, the Europeans needed our money for theMarshall Plan. Then they needed our military backing because of theSoviet threat. But now, if the Soviet military is a question thatone of your successors will have to deal with _ eventually what arethey going to need from us? What role do we really have to playhere? We don't live on this continent.   A. Well, we have a tremendous interaction, if you want tohypothetically project that _ that guaranteed peaceful time, Iwould say interaction with the United States on student exchanges,cultural exchanges, economic matters. I mean, there's a tremendouspotential for a Soviet Union that is in accord with us on thesedemocratic values. It's a tremendous market, for example, but itneeds the economic reform. So what we've got to do is be sure thatwe conduct ourselves in such a way that the changes, the politicalreforms, can keep going forward there in Eastern Europe, that theycan _ that the Soviet Union can do what Mr. Gorbachev is trying todo internally. And then there's just enormous potential for livingat peace with that tremendous power.   Q. Sir, maybe I misstated my question. What I really mean is,what _ why do West Europeans need us once the military threatrecedes _ the West Europeans? Why would there have to be a NATO?This is a political and military alliance, and it's really only apolitical alliance because of the military need.   A. You mean _ would _ why will there always have to be a U.S.presence?   Q. Why will there always have to be a NATO?   A. Well, I'm not sure _ I'm _ if you want to project out 100years or. ...   Q. Well, no. ...   A. _ take some _ take some years off of that, you can look to autopian day when there might not be. But as I pointed out to them,that day hasn't arrived, and they agree with me. And so the UnitedStates must stay involved. What we don't want to do is send thesignal of decoupling, the decoupling of the United States andCanada from NATO, particularly at this highly sensitive time, andMr. Gorbachev understood that. He made that point to me.   Yes?   Q. Did President Gorbachev ask your forebearance in case hedecided to crack down on dissidents, and if so, what did you say?Or what role did the question of ethnic and Baltic dissent have inyour meeting?   A. The answer to the first part is no. And the answer to thesecond part is I asked him to describe for me the problems inside _the nationality problems inside the Soviet Union, and he did it inconsiderable detail.   Yeah?
