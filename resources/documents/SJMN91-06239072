Everyone, thatis, except the people who know the full story: McClain and the city council.;  McClain resigned under pressure in April after months of friction with thecouncil majority over their business-friendly philosophy. His departureangered residents, in part because council members were vague about theirreasons for wanting him out.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CASE CLOSEDPRYING OPEN THE FREMONT CITY MANAGER'S DEPARTUREDEAL WON'T BRING HIM BACK  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     The departure agreement McClain negotiated with the council included aprovision that neither side would talk publicly about their disagreementsuntil after the November election.;   But fans of McClain and foes of councilmembers Gary Mello and Alane Loisel weren't going to let it drop. First theybegan a drive to recall the two council members. Then last month a citizensgroup filed suit, claiming the gag violated the First Amendment.;   Thelawsuit is clearly frivolous. It is common for departure agreements to includesuch clauses. If McClain had been coerced into it, there might be some basisfor a challenge. But the savvy City Hall veteran, knowing continuedcontroversy wouldn't help his chances of finding another job, suggested theclause in the first place.;   This week the city council is expected to removethe gag provision from McClain's departure agreement. Does that mean we canexpect a burst of talk-show appearances by council members or a juicy,tell-all book from McClain?;   Hardly. There is no change of heart here,merely an effort to save the cost of a court fight.;   The council members, atthe urging of attorneys, are likely to keep quiet. McClain, who's still out ofwork, says he has no intention of talking. It's time to look forward, he says,not backward.;   He's right. McClain is a solid manager, and we wanted to seehim stay. But we recognized that the growing rift with the council made himineffective, and he had to go. While we'd love to know the details of hisdemise, we doubt that knowledge would have changed the outcome.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910826  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  346  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday, August 26, 199100239072,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
