The College of Dental Surgeons of British Columbia kicked offdental health month Friday with an attempted demonstration oftooth-brushing on Hyak, a 7-ton killer whale at Vancouver Aquarium.   Photographers gathered at the edge of the aquarium pool astrainer Doug Pemberton crouched with a 5-foot-long red toothbrushand a bucket of herring to get Hyak to open wide for a brushing.   Hyak approached for a snack, took one look at the toothbrush andheaded for the other side of the pool with a spurt from his blowhole.   The black and white whale isn't shy about performing in regularshows, aquarium spokesman Stefani Hewlett said. But at age 24, Hyakis set in his ways.   ``He's a very experienced animal in everything else, but thetoothbrush is something new and he is highly suspicious of it,obviously, and he's giving it a very wide berth,'' Hewlett said.   The responsibilities of dental health month fell to another ofthe aquarium's three orcas, 12-year-old Finna, after Hyak fizzled.   Finna opened wide for a tooth brushing after a treat of herring.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oscar was the hit of show-and-tell at MicahRosenthal's school.
