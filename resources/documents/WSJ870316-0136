The board of governors of Intelsat, a little-known but powerful satellite communications consortium, named Mr. Burch, currently an influential Washington lawyer, its director general on Friday. Ratification by Intelsat's 113 member nations, scheduled for early April, is considered a formality.    Intelsat currently has a near-monopoly on international satellite telecommunications, but it faces competitive threats from fiber-optic communications and separate, privately owned communications satellites. &quot;The next big battle over preserving a telecommunications monopoly is coming with Intelsat and Comsat at the center of the controversy,&quot; predicted Harry Shooshan, a Washington telecommunications consultant.    Communications Satellite Corp., or Comsat, a Washington-based satellite communications company, owns about 25% of Intelsat.    Mr. Burch, 59 years old, was chairman of the FCC from 1969 to 1974 and adviser to Presidents Nixon and Ford. He takes over Intelsat at a time of internal upheaval caused by the dismissal of Richard Colino, director general, and Jose Alegrett, deputy director general. The two men are now under investigation by the U.S. attorney here for allegedly making questionable payments totaling millions of dollars to loan brokers and consultants.    Messrs. Colino and Alegrett previously have denied any wrongdoing. Intelsat sources have said that Mr. Alegrett is cooperating with Intelsat on the matter.    While at the FCC, Mr. Burch pushed hard for deregulation, encouraging competition in long-distance telephone service and opening the domestic satellite market to companies other than Comsat. Walter Hinchman, the head of the FCC's common carrier bureau under Mr. Burch, who helped establish those policies, now is a senior staff member at Intelsat.    Under Mr. Colino, Intelsat effectively protected its near-monopoly powers. But Henry Geller, a former aide to Mr. Burch at the FCC, believes the organization must change or it will be swamped by competition. To reduce its transatlantic telephone rates, Mr. Geller said, the organization may be forced to stop subsidizing rates for telephone calls to smaller countries and to alter its structure in areas where Comsat and other countries' telecommunications representatives act as distributors of Intelsat services. </TEXT></DOC>
