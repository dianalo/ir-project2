But not because of flag-burning. This time it's a fierydebate on free speech that began when some police officers inthe Bronx started wearing flag patches on their sleeves toshow support for U.S. forces in the Gulf.</LP><TEXT>   But the men and women in blue were prohibited from doingthat, even though these days Madonna can wear a flag blanketin an election ad and the Stars and Stripes graces designersweaters. The New York Police Department ordered thesix-square-inch patches removed, saying they violated uniformregulations.   &quot;This is a classic example of the police brass failing todo what they demand of the foot soldiers. They failed toexercise intelligent discretion,&quot; says James Lysaght, generalcounsel for the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.   The department does allow policemen to wear aone-square-inch flag emblem, but in a very specific way, thespokesman notes. &quot;We can wear the American flag on the upperleft side of our chest a quarter-inch above the center of theshield.&quot;   Claiming that officers' First Amendment rights were beingviolated, the patrolmen's association has taken thedepartment to court. &quot;The department should be a little morelenient. They should recognize that this is a patrioticgesture,&quot; says an association spokesman.   For now, state Supreme Court Justice Peter Tom is goingalong with the association's suggestion that the two partieswork out the dispute through the Police Department's uniformcommittee. If the matter isn't settled by Friday, he'll makethe decision, says Justice Tom.   All this is a source of bemusement for David Cole, alawyer with the Center for Constitutional Rights in New Yorkwho has defended flag-burning cases before the U.S. SupremeCourt. &quot;I don't see the danger of policemen engaged in arelatively minor statement of their political views.&quot;   But police top brass may be discomfited to know that inthis case they seem to have a supporter in William Kunstler,Mr. Cole's fellow defense lawyer. Mr. Kunstler would like tominimize all forms of flagwaving, because he thinks itpromotes jingoism. And while officers have a right to freespeech, they shouldn't exercise it on official duty, he says,adding: &quot;A policeman can go and sew it on his underwear or onhis business suit -- when he's off duty.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
