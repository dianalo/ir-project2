The request for amendment was submitted by letters dated June6, 1988, and January 11, 1989.The amendment would revise the Technical Specification (TS) as follows:(1) TS andSection; 4.21, ``Liquid Effluents,'' would be reorganized, clarifiedand modified, and would explicitly detail the sampling and analysis requirements,release paths, accountability points, design bases, dose projection requirements,and regulatory requirements for the release of radiological liquid effluentfrom the plant. (2) Changes to the Lower Limit of Detection (LLD) concentrationvalues for specific nuclides would be made to reduce the required counttime for a pre-release Regenerant Hold-Up Tank (RHUT) sample analysis.The changes made to the LLD value would meet established design basis andprovide reasonable assurance of compliance with the dose guidelines of10 CFR 50, Appendix I for radiological liquid effluents. (3) LLD's forpre-release sample analysis on a Retention Basin would be established,which would assure the capability of compliance with the radiological liquideffluent concentration limits of 10 CFR 20, Appendix B. (4) The LLD equationand definition found in TS andSection;andSection; 4.21, 4.22, and 4.26 wouldbe modified; the origin and basis was established in NUREG/CR-4007 andthe LLD equation design basis document.Before issuance of the proposed license amendment, the Commission willhave made findings required by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended(the Act) and the Commission's regulations.The Commission has made a proposed determination that the request for amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission's regulationsin 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facility in accordancewith the proposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increasein the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. These three criteria are discussed below.(1) The NRC staff finds that the proposed amendment does not involve asignificant increase in the probability or consequences of an accidentpreviously evaluated because the proposed Technical Specification changeswill not affect plant design or alter the safety and accident analysisof the Safety Analysis Report. Results of procedural and programmatic changesinvolving management of radiological liquid effluent will have no adverseimpact on any accident analysed in the Safety Analysis Report.(2) The NRC staff finds that the proposed amendment does not create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated because the proposed Technical Specification change do not adverselyimpact any safety-related system and do not provide any new mechanismsby which an accident could occur.(3) The NRC staff finds that the proposed amendment does not involve asignificant reduction in a margin of safety because the proposed TechnicalSpecification changes will not compromise the plant's ability to complywith the radiological liquid effluent release limits of 10 CFR Part 20,Appendix B and guidelines of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix I. The proposed RadiologicalEffluent Technical Specifications (RETS) changes will verify the designbasis for radiological liquid effluent.The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing.Comments should be addressed to the Rules and Procedures Branch, Divisionof Rules and Records, Office of Administration, U.S. Nuclear RegulatoryCommission, Washington, DC 20555, and should cite the publication dateand page number of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland, from 7:30 a.m.to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments may be examined at the NRC PublicDocument Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555. The filing of requestsand petitions for leave to intervene is discussed below.By May 24, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing with respectto issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operating license,and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceeding and whowishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file a writtenpetition for leave to intervene. Request for a hearing and petitions forleave to intervene must be filed in accordance with the Commission's ``Rulesof Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If arequest for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filed by theabove date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board designatedby the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and LicensingBoard Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition, and the Secretaryor the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issue a noticeof hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) Thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspects(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above.Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party.Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses.If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held.If the final determination is that the request for amendment involves nosignificant hazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendmentand make it effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Any hearingheld would take place after issuance of the amendment.If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment.Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice such that failure to act in a timely way would result, for example,in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission may issue the licenseamendment before the expiration of the 30-day notice period, provided thatits final determination is that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The final determination will consider all public and Statecomments received. Should the Commission take this action, it will publisha notice of issuance and provide for opportunity for a hearing after issuance.The Commission expects that the need to take this action will occur veryinfrequently.A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW.,Washington, DC 20555, by the above date. Where petitions are filed duringthe last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitioneror representative promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to George W. Knighton: petitioner'sname and telephone number; date petition was mailed; plant name; and publicationdate and page number of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to David S. Kaplan, Sacramento Municipal UtilityDistrict, 6201 S Street, P.O. Box 15830, Sacramento, California 95813,attorney for the licensee.Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of the factors specified in 10CFR 2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.174(d).For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at theMartin Luther King Regional Library, 7340 24th Street Bypass, Sacramento,California 95822.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 14th day of April, 1989</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Steven A.
