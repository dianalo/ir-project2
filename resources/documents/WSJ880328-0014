Closed were Investors Savings andamp; Loan Association, El Reno, and United Savings, Durant. Both had been under management selected by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board since last June after bad lending practices drove them into insolvency.    The Bank Board said it paid $169.4 million to transfer insured accounts from the two thrifts to Midwest Federal, and it projected it wouldn't recover $76.3 million.    Investors Savings had assets of $81.1 million and liabilities of $108 million, and was losing about $500,000 a month when it was closed. United Savings had $86.5 million in assets and liabilities of $107.5 million.    The Bank Board blamed Investors Savings' problems on its former management. The board said the thrift invested heavily in commercial real estate developments &quot;without adequate underwriting practices or loan documentation.&quot;    United Savings also ran into the red on imprudent loans for construction and other purposes, according to the Bank Board.    The board said both thrifts held a large number of participation loans from Savings Investment Services Corp., where Investors Savings' former president served as director, and from C.B. Financial Corp. A board spokesman said he had no details on those entities.    The Bank Board has closed or merged 17 thrifts this year. </TEXT></DOC>
