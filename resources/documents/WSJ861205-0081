Rosenthal andamp; Associates Inc. was terminated.    Gates said that discussions are continuing with Rosenthal and other potential buyers and that it still hopes to complete a sale by year-end. A spokesman for the closely held concern, which has interests in automotive and industrial parts, said that the agreement was terminated by &quot;mutual consent&quot; and that &quot;we're trying to find different ways of doing the same thing.&quot;    Rosenthal couldn't be reached for comment.    Gates signed a definitive agreement in September to sell its 7.8 million shares of Gates Learjet, a Tucson, Ariz.-based maker of business jets, to Rosenthal, a New York investment firm, for about $62.7 million in cash and preferred stock.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Gates Learjet closed at $5, down 50 cents.    Gates Learjet recently reported a third-quarter loss of $24.6 million, compared with a $9.3 million loss a year earlier. Revenue fell 2.6% to $60.4 million from $62 million. </TEXT></DOC>
