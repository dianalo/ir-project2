(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thirty-two alligators were killedand left to rot on the west side of Lake Okeechobee in what may havebeen a vendetta against a state game officer, wildlife officials say.   Poaching was not the motive because the reptiles' valuable hidesand tails _ containing choice meat _ were left intact, they say.   No arrests have been made in the gator killings, a third-degreefelony punishable by up to five years in jail and a $5,000 fine.Except during brief special hunting seasons, only wildlife officersand the state's 46 licensed nuisance-alligator trappers areauthorized to kill the animals in the wild.   Capt. James R. Doxey, of the Florida Game and Fresh Water FishCommission, said the shooting spree two weeks ago may have been aresult of someone's anger over a poaching arrest, because at leastone clue was left.   One gator was dangling from a pole and spray-painted on itscarcass was the name of a wildlife officer who patrols the700,000-acre lake.   Wildlife officers occasionally find one or two gators shot, ``butnever on a scale like this,'' said Lindsey Hord, the gamecommission's South Florida Alligator Program coordinator.   ``It was just wanton destruction. There is absolutely nojustification for shooting that many gators,'' he said.   Alligators generally steer clear of humans, but there have beenseveral instances of them attacking and killing or wounding people.   Despite that danger, wildlife officers say they still run acrossevidence of gator abuse not necessarily related to poaching,including bullet-riddled carcasses floating in canals and livegators swimming around with protruding darts or arrows.   Mike Rafferty, a nuisance gator trapper in Palm City, said he hasseen people with guns using gators for target practice.   ``Alligators are not an attractive species to most people. Theyare not furry when they are young,'' said Mike Jennings, analligator biologist with the game commission.   The game commission made 227 arrests statewide for alligatorviolations _ including poaching _ from July 1988 to July of thisyear, said Maj. Jim Ries of the commission.   Lt. Dick Lawrence, who supervises the game commission's regionalnuisance gator trapping program, recalled a case last year in whichtwo men were arrested for dropping concrete blocks on a gator'shead. The gator was under a bridge and not threatening anyone.   ``We ended up going down and killing the gator because he was sobadly injured,'' Lawrence said.   Fishing guides have been known to shoot gators and large birdsthat might threaten a customer's catch, wildlife officials said. Andcattle growers have killed alligators on their ranches because ofthe threat to calves, Doxey said.</TEXT></DOC>
