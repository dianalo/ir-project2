Manuel A. Noriega appears to temporarily strengthen his grip on power, but the collapse of his country's economy still seems almost certain to doom him in the long run.    In Panama City, opponents of the military strongman warned that the failure of the coup attempt -- by a band of mainly midlevel officers, at least five of whom were arrested -- will make it harder to persuade others within the Panama Defense Forces to mount a challenge to Gen. Noriega, their leader.    &quot;Now an element of the military that was with us is removed,&quot; one opposition leader said. &quot;Noriega is immensely strengthened.&quot;    In Washington, U.S. officials said they were surprised by the coup attempt, which they said originated with military hardliners worried that the country was slipping out of control. They said neither the Panamanian opposition in Washington nor Eric Arturo Delvalle, recognized by Washington as Panama's president, was behind the attempt.    Mr. Delvalle, who is in hiding, last month started the latest political crisis by firing Gen. Noriega after the general was indicted in Florida on drug-related charges. Gen. Noriega responded by having Panama's legislature, which he controls, fire Mr. Delvalle. The U.S., in support of Mr. Delvalle, took a series of moves to cripple the economy by drying up the supply of U.S. dollars, which Panama uses as its currency. The steps have made the government unable to meet many of its payrolls and have led to widespread street demonstrations.    Nonetheless, Gen. Noriega still commands fierce loyalty within the military. &quot;He continues to have a lot of authentic support among the majority of officers,&quot; said a Washington source involved in the U.S. efforts. &quot;The coup makers acted prematurely.&quot; He said the officers &quot;should have waited five days or a week more&quot; for economic problems to further weaken the general, &quot;and they could have rallied more support.&quot;    Now, he said, the short-term advantage will flow in the other direction. &quot;Historically, it is a proven fact that once a coup d'etat fails, it takes weeks or months to pull off another one,&quot; because of purges and increased security.    By last night, calm had returned to Panama City, where word of the coup attempt had triggered the worst rioting since efforts to topple the general began 10 months ago. Late yesterday, for the first time in three weeks, soldiers were deployed to patrol the streets. Power outages were reported throughout the city, and virtually all stores and businesses were closed.    U.S. officials said they still believe Gen. Noreiga is in his final days in power. &quot;It's unfortunate the coup failed because it may strengthen Noriega's hand&quot; with the military, one official said. &quot;However, his continued rule is having more and more impact on people's daily lives. We don't think the coup failure has an impact on our, or President Delvalle's, efforts to get the man out.&quot;    Juan Sosa, Panama's ambassador to the U.S., who is loyal to President Delvalle, said the failed coup attempt wouldn't impede efforts to oust Gen. Noriega. &quot;The initial attempt fizzled, but that's not important,&quot; he said. &quot;The message is the defense forces are divided. We're talking about days, if not hours, for the Noriega dictatorship.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
