Barco will stop in Washington on his way to New York to addressthe United Nations, White House press Secretary Marlin Fitzwatersaid Tuesday   The visit comes as bombings and violence continue to rock thedrug-trafficking plagued South American nation, in the wake ofBarco's crackdown to rid Colombia of drugs.   On Monday and Tuesday, three explosions, attributed to drugtraffickers, blasted Cartagena and Bogota, killing two people.   Asked if Bush would press Barco to request help from U.S.troops, beyond the military equipment the administration already issending, Fitzwater said no.   ``We have said from the beginning we would respond only torequests by the president. We respect his rights and wishes aspresident of that country, and whether or not he requests any moreaid in terms of money or troops or whatever is entirely within hispurview,'' Fitzwater said.   The recent bombings, the spokesman said, ``are an exclamationpoint to the danger there and to the desperation that the countryfaces in terms of its drug problem. It strengthens the commitmentof everyone to continue the fight.''   Bush has repeatedly expressed verbal support for Barco's effortsagainst the drug traffickers and recently ordered $65 million inmilitary equipment and weaponry be sent to assist him.   He also has requested $251 million from Congress for next yearto help Peru, Colombia and Bolivia in their drug wars.   Fitzwater said Bush and Barco, in addition to the drugsituation, will talk about trade and U.S. aid to Colombia.   Bush will meet with Barco in the residence quarters of the WhiteHouse after his return from the two-day education summit meetingwith the nation's governors in Charlottesville, Va.</TEXT></DOC>
