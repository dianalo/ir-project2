The potential jump produced between the two plasmas,when the potential applied to the central plasma was effectively positiveto the edge one, is much larger than that for the negative applied potential.It is revealed that the time resolved measurement of the potential anddensity profile, when the pulsed potential is applied between the plamas,has a time delay of the potential formation. This is caused by an effectof the relaxation mechanism in the plasma. The potential formation processbetween the positive and negative pulse potential parts is irreversible.The density deformation followed the potential formation.</TEXT></DOC>
