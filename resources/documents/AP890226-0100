Videos are being filmed and distributed, letters mass-mailed,brochures and booklets are rolling off presses, post-card campaignsare under way, news articles are being reprinted and news mediaoffices are receiving near-daily fax and Federal Express deliveriesfrom each side.   Much of the action in these final days before a potentiallydevastating strike is taking place away from the bargaining table,in a struggle for hearts and minds.   Although federal mediation efforts continue, both sides are readyfor a strike at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, the end of the cooling-offperiod set by the National Mediation Board. There haven't been signsof progress toward a settlement in negotiations that began 17 monthsago, but President Bush could at least put off a strike for 60 daysby appointing an emergency board to investigate the Easternsituation.   Eastern, losing $1 million a day, says it can't afford moredelaying actions by a union it says refuses to face the failingcarrier's economic realities by accepting $150 million in pay cuts.The Machinists favor the presidential board, saying outsideintervention is needed because, they believe, management wants astrike to try to bust the union.   There's more to the Eastern-Machinists showdown than the loomingwalkout of the 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlers, ramp workers andjanitors represented by the Machinists, comprising about 30 percentof Eastern's work force.   For a successful strike, Machinists leaders say, they probablywill need help from the pilots and flight attendants, and also hopefor supportive actions from the national Machinists union, otherairline industry workers and from the public.   Eastern, meanwhile, has been negotiating with its pilots in hopesthey will cross Machinists picket lines, reportedly has been hiringreplacement workers, and is expected to call on parent Texas AirCorp. and its other subsidiaries, particularly Continental Airlines,for help.   It is expected that management supervisors would return to theline to keep the airline flying should there be a strike. Eastern iscounting on its strong frequent-traveler traffic to continue, withmany fliers willing to ignore the strike to keep building up theirbonus miles. Eastern fliers the past two weeks have received couponsgood for one-third discounts if they fly during the three weeksstarting March 4.   Eastern tells its other employees in its brochures and employeebulletins that the Machinists' refusal to make the wage sacrificesmade by the other unions has crippled the carrier. While the otherunions made 20 percent wage concessions in 1986, Eastern says, theMachinists' refusal forced the sale of Eastern to Texas Air.   It portrays Machinists District 100 President Charles E. Bryan asan egotistic near-maniac who wants to run the airline himself.   ``If Charlie isn't stopped, he will destroy Eastern,'' said ared-colored booklet titled ``Charlie Says...,'' distributed lastweek among Eastern managers.   ``Since Charlie took office in early 1980, Eastern Airlines andits employees have suffered to the point that Eastern's existence isin grave question,'' the booklet says. ``He has caused great harm tothis company to achieve his personal goal of owning and running thecompany.''   Bryan says Eastern employees have suffered for years of badmanagement and now have owners with no commitment to the future. Hesays more employee influence on the carrier would spur productivityand improve service.   The Machinists countered with mailings of a Fortune magazinemini-profile of Texas Air Chairman Frank Lorenzo that described himas one of America's toughest bosses, but not a very effective one.   The Machinists warn fellow employees that Lorenzo doesn't careabout Eastern's future, but wants only to milk its cash assets.   Although Eastern reportedly has been talking to the pilots abouta ``fence agreement'' aimed at strengthening job security andEastern's viability, Machinists leaders hope the pilots will sidewith fellow employees over a management they say can't be trusted.   ``If we go down, the pilots and flight attendants will follow,''said Frank Ortis, Machinists local 702 vice president. ``Lorenzowill dismantle the airline.''</TEXT></DOC>
