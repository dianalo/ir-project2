The attacks came as representatives of El Salvador's majorpolitical parties met in Mexico with top commanders of the guerrillaarmy to discuss a modified insurgent electoral proposal the rebelssay could end the war.   ``Rejection of the proposal will mean the war will not onlycontinue, but will escalate,'' said the Farabundo Marti NationalLiberation Front's radio.   The 9-year-old war has killed an estimated 70,000 people, most ofthem civilians.   The early morning attack on the 4,000-member 1st Brigade'sheadquarters was the fifth on a major military installation in thiscapital since November. With jurisdiction over the capital and itsenvirons, the brigade headquarters is considered the country's mostimportant military installation.   The commander of the 1st army brigade reported no casualtiesinside the downtown base and that damage was negligible, but herefused to allow journalists inside.   The rebels used two pickup trucks fitted with catapults. Thedetonation of one explosive charge launches the bombs andsimultaneously blows up the vehicle.   The explosion of one of the vehicles killed Pedro Martinez, about70 years old, and his wife Maria Teresa, about 65, who lived in ahouse near the headquarters.   The rebels also attacked the headquarters of the Detachment ofEngineers in Zacatecoluca, 35 miles southeast of San Salvador.Officers there said three soldiers, including a major, were killedat Zacatecoluca; one civilian and a Civil Defense trooper werekilled in fighting nearby.   Martinez's body lay on the sidewalk in front of his humble homean hour after the vehicle parked in front of it exploded at 6:20 a.m.   Col. Orlando Zepeda, commander of the first brigade, said Mrs.Martinez, whose legs were blown off by the blast, died on the way tothe hospital. He said three people, all civilians were wounded bythe explosions.   The explosions broke windows, gouged walls and blew doors offhinges in 12 homes.   In Zacatecoluca, guerrillas and soldiers battled for three hoursbefore dawn around the engineers' base, according to officialsthere, including base commander Col. Benjamin Canjura.   He said Maj. Donald Sampson was killed in the fighting. Threeother soldiers were reported killed when a rocket-propelled grenadehit the truck in which they were traveling. One civilian and oneCivil Defense trooper were killed in a clash in a nearby village.   Canjura said 13 soldiers and one civilian were wounded in thefighting. There was no immediate word on guerrilla casualties.   In Mexico, the guerrillas proposed that elections be postponedfrom March 19 to June and that a cease-fire be insituted. It was aswitch from previous demands the election be postponed untilSeptember, but left constitutional problems unresolved.   The constitution calls for President Jose Napoleon Duarte toleave office on June 1; right-wing and center political parties haveopposed any change in that date and the army has hinted of a coup ifDuarte overstays.   The guerrillas say the parties are hiding behind the constitutionbecause they don't want to negotiate seriously.</TEXT></DOC>
