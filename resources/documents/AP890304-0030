The financially troubled carrier's pilots andflight attendants joined the strike which President Bush refused tohalt by invoking emergency powers.   ``It's the most overwhelming support I have seen in the historyof the labor movement,'' said Machinists union local PresidentCharles Bryan after federally mediated talks collapsed in Washingtonand unionists threw up pickets.   The walkout instantly disrupted Easter flights at Miami, theairline's headquarters. One of the first Eastern post-strikeflights, about to depart for Puerto Rico, was canceled after theflight crew walked out at midnight.   ``They say there's another Eastern flight,'' said passenger RonAdams, 51. ``But I'm going to try to get my ticket endorsed foranother airline. I've been traveling for 3{ days and I'm too tiredto wait around.''   From Atlanta to Los Angeles, carloads of pickets careened intoairports by the midnight deadline, reporters for The AssociatedPress in those areas said.   At Newark, N.J., an important Eastern hub, the last Easternflight arrived at 11:57 p.m. from Tampa, Fla. and passengers wereclearly relieved. Three others scheduled to San Juan, Atlanta andFord Lauderdale were cancelled.   The strike capped an emotional 17-month feud between the unionand Eastern that has come to symbolize the problems faced by one ofthe nation's largest and most unprofitable airlines.   In Miami, about 3,000 workers charged across the street from thelocal union hall to corporate headquarters, chanting and carryingplacards. Some hurled rocks, bottles and concrete blocks over thebarbed wire-topped fence.   They tore up effigies of Texas Air Corp. chairman Frank Lorenzo,the hard-line boss who bought Eastern three years ago.   Riot police turned back some workers who tried to storm Easterngates. Matell said some union members apparently did crash throughgates, but he had no details.   ``Estamos en huelga! (We are on strike!),'' shouted union localaide Marty Urra, speaking in Spanish. Later, he added: ``It's ashame. It could have been avoided.''   Police cars with sirens screaming and some officers in riot geartook their places at Miami's airport and Eastern implemented strikecontingency plans it said could keep the carrier flying``indefinitely.''   Matell said a proposal made less than two hours before the strikedeadline guaranteed job security for the 8,500-member union. Butunion members said the company offered scant improvements over itsdemand for $150 million in wage concessions.   Wally Haber, a Machinists general chairman, reported strongsupport from Eastern's pilots and flight attendants and predictedsupport from other unions across the nation.   ``It's no longer a fight between Machinists and Eastern. It's afight between labor and corporate America,'' Haber said.   In a related action, the Airline Pilots Association announced its40,000 members next Tuesday would begin to precisely follow flyingprocedures, causing ``substantial'' airport delays.   The AFL-CIO has urged all members to honor picket lines and theMachinists have vowed to picket trains, ports and other airlines.   Joseph Leonard, Eastern's chief operating officer, said thecarrier slashed weekend flights by up to 75 percent but could keepflying. Service will be maintained to about 50 cities, includingmost flights from Miami and on the airline's Northeast shuttle andLatin American routes, he said.   In Washington, U.S. District Judge John H. Pratt ruled thatMachinists at other airlines could not honor Eastern machinists'picket lines in view of no-strike, no-slowdown clauses'' in theircontracts with other carriers.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told a news conference theTransportation Department ``will monitor the situation and will, inaddition, take whatever steps are needed to protect the safety ofthe traveling public.''   Eastern said it had contracted with 1,100 non-union mechanics toservice its planes. Leonard said Eastern could fly indefinitely with200 management pilots and those who cross picket lines if pilotshonor a walkout.   Leonard told reporters in Miami the Machinists were sent homeearly in the day after a federal judge said it was necessary toensure passenger safety. He denied it was a lockout move.   Bush's refusal to invoke an emergency mediation panel and imposea 60-day cooling-off period in the 17-month-old dispute marked hisfirst major labor-crisis decision.   To Eastern's machinists it signaled a major dimming of hope.``The reaction here is we would just as soon get it over with,''said Rick Iacino, a Machinists general chairman. ``Our people arepumped up; they're ready. War has been declared.''   The airline, which says it is losing $1 million a day, has beenseeking $150 million in concessions from the Machinists, the unionthat includes mechanics, baggage handlers and other ground workers.   Eastern flies about 100,000 people a day with an average of 1,040daily flights. It has 250 airliners.   The 60-year-old, Miami-based carrier, owned by Texas Air Corp.,wanted Bush to stay out of the dispute, claiming it could not affordany delay.   Eastern's pilots rejected an appeal Thursday by Lorenzo for themto sign a new contract and cross Machinists picket lines.   Eastern flight attendants said they would honor picket lines,although Lorenzo _ who in 1983 took Continental Airlines intobankruptcy reorganization to end a labor confrontation _ has warnedthat the action could land Eastern ``in the corporate graveyard.''   Airports nationwide strengthened security and made contingenciesfor dealing with the strike. Other airlines, some of which havedeclined to promise to honor Eastern tickets, have reported surgesin sales this week.   ``We will do our best to assist Eastern passengers should therebe a work stoppage,'' stated Delta Air Lines, which arranged toaccept Eastern tickets.   Leonard said the company had experienced ``significant amounts ofvandalism'' and got permission from U.S. District Judge C. ClydeAtkins in Miami to send workers home. Atkins said it was necessaryfor passenger safety.   Workers were given a paid holiday and told to report back to workat 12:01 a.m. Saturday, one minute after the strike deadline,Leonard said.   Leonard said the company had reliable information that Machinistsplanned at midnight to deploy emergency chutes on all Easternplanes, threatening equipment and causing lengthy flight delays.   Frank Ortis, Machinists Local 702 vice president, denied theclaim.   ``Our people are professionals. There is no sabotage,'' Ortissaid while hundreds of union members wearing black T-shirts, somewith skull-and-crossbones warnings to ``scab'' strike replacementworkers, awaited news at the local union near Eastern corporateheadquarters.   The company contended that Machinists set at least four fires inrecent days at Miami International Airport and Atlanta's HartsfieldInternational Airport. Atkins ruled there was ``credible evidence''that at least one fire was set by Machinists, beneath a concourse atMiami International.   The Machinists vowed to picket other airlines, ships andrailroads, and AFL-CIO officials have said they want their 14million members to support the Eastern Machinists.   In St. Paul, Minn., a federal judge on Thursday issued an orderbarring Northwest Airlines' 21,000-member Machinists' union fromstaging a sympathy strike in the event of a walkout, pending a March13 hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
