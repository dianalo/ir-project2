Crude for October delivery rose to $35 a barrel inafternoon trading, the highest since trading in crude oilfutures was started in 1983, before settling at $34.71, up$1.53 for the day.</LP><TEXT>   It was the last day of trading for the October contract, asituation that usually brings an increase in volatility. TheNovember crude contract rose 45 cents a barrel to settle at$33.42 after hitting a high of $33.60 for the day.   Several bullish news items hit oil markets late yesterdayto contribute to the price surge. Among them were publishedreports that Saudi Arabia had suspended shipments of oil toJordan because of nonpayment and that the World Bank had saidoil prices could reach $65 a barrel if the Middle East crisistriggers a war. There were also belligerent statements fromIraqi officials concerning the Persian Gulf standoff andreports of pending interruptions at several petroleumrefineries for maintenance or repairs.   As a result, gasoline and most other fuels also postedsizzling gains in spot and futures prices. The gasolinemarket had been weakening because of growing evidence thatdemand is slackening. But yesterday, the futures price forunleaded gasoline for October delivery rose 1.64 cents tosettle at 91.54 cents a gallon, and most other gasolinecontracts were up their limit of two cents a gallon.   Still, the star of the markets was heating oil, whichleaped beyond gasoline in price. In U.S. futures trading,heating oil for October delivery reached a high of 92.5 centsa gallon before ending the day at 91.86 cents, up 3.33 cents.The November contract was up the limit of two cents at 91.66cents.   The focus on heating oil, which was also responsible for alate Wednesday rally in petroleum prices, was helpedyesterday by the National Weather Service. It predicted thatthe regions that use the most fuel in the U.S. -- theNortheast and Great Lakes states -- will have colder weatherthan usual for the next few months.   The strengthening in the U.S. market for heating oilfollows a steady firming in Europe for gasoil, as the fuel isknown there. The weather is already cool enough for heatingpurposes in several parts of Europe, and some European usersof fuel oil have been &quot;topping off&quot; their tanks as a hedgeagainst possible shortages this winter resulting from theMiddle East crisis.   On London's International Petroleum Exchange, where gasoilis priced by the ton, the October contract settled at $286 aton yesterday, up $11 from Wednesday's close.   &quot;There is very good demand in gasoil in Europe that isspilling over into heating oil in the U.S.,&quot; said ShahrokhNikkhah, senior vice president, futures investments, atPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. In U.S. heating oil prices,he said, he foresees &quot;another eight cents to 10 centspotential&quot; for increases.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS and SOYBEANS: Prices closed mixed in relativelylight trading. Some private weather services' forecasts offrost Sunday night across portions of the northern tier ofMidwestern states kept corn and soybean futures prices higherfor much of the session. Because a wet spring delayedplanting in many areas, the soybean and corn crops aren't asmature at this point as they normally would be. Soybeanfutures traders who sold contracts earlier in the week whenforecasters were playing down frost worries bought them backyesterday, said Daniel Basse, director of marketing forAgResource Co. in Chicago. But near the close of trading,so-called local traders on the Chicago Board of Trade floorappeared to be selling contracts to even up their holdings.Soybean futures for November delivery closed one-half centlower at $6.1725 a bushel after being five cents a bushelhigher at midmorning. December corn futures closed 1.5 centsa bushel higher at $2.2375 on frost worries and concentratedbuying from one or more big speculators, traders said.December wheat futures slid 0.75 cent to close at $2.685 abushel.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices plunged to near athree-year low in heavy selling, while gold and silver wereslightly higher. October delivery platinum ended with a lossof $4.50 an ounce at $454.10. But it dropped as low as$448.50, which was the lowest since $445 in February 1988.The October contract has been declining steadily. As recentlyas Aug. 21, it traded at $514. According to Bernard Savaiko,metals analyst for Paine Webber, the major factor depressingprices yesterday was reports of Far Eastern selling ofplatinum, mostly from Japan. There was speculation that someof the selling may have been on behalf of the Soviet Union,the world's second-largest platinum producer and a country inneed of foreign exchange, Mr. Savaiko said. He also saidhigher interest rates in Japan may have prompted dealers tosell metal because of the rise in carrying costs. The partialrecovery in futures that trimmed the decline was attributedto a late surge in crude oil, Mr. Savaiko said. Decemberdelivery gold was up $2.80 an ounce at $394.20, ending justunder the day's high of $394.30 in moderate trading. Decembersilver edged 0.7 cent an ounce higher to $4.86.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices declined. The December contractended with a loss of two cents a pound at $1.1775. Thecontract traded over a range of more than four cents, as itrose to $1.2140 shortly after the opening, only to be hit byrenewed selling that dropped it to the day's low of $1.1720.According to one analyst, the price rose after selling thathad been influenced by weakness in London in the previous twosessions ran its course. Renewed selling then developed ontechnical considerations, he said. Another analyst saidfactors weakening prices included concern over an economicslowdown and a possible consequent decline in copperconsumption, expectations of a rise in London Metal Exchangewarehouse stocks in a report due out today and a belief thata miners' strike in Peru that began Aug. 17 is close to beingsettled.</TEXT></DOC>
