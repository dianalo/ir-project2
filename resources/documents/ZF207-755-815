(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Gina SmithandM;IBM and Microsoft Corp. programmers are working on a way to let futureversions of OS/2 Presentation Manager run unmodified Windows applications.andM;The technology will appear as a software layer within Presentation Manager(PM) that transparently translates Windows calls into PM calls, according toseveral sources close to the companies.andP;  While stressing that such atechnology is more than a year away, the sources said it could show up inOS/2 PM version 2.0 for the 386, which is expected in late 1990.andM;Although Microsoft and IBM officials would neither confirm nor deny thereports, sources said such a plan carries great economic and technicalimplications for future OS/2 users and developers.andM;For corporate users, the ability to run hundreds of existing commercial andvertical Windows applications under OS/2 would mean an easier migration pathto OS/2 and large savings in application purchases.andM;&quot;If [OS/2 PM] had this capability today, we'd move to it now and run all ourWindows applications on it,&quot; said Steve Morse, senior technical officer atManufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.andP;  &quot;That's the best thing about this-- we won't have to wait for all the PM-specific applications to come out.&quot;andM;For future PM developers, particularly those who have created or are creatingWindows applications, such technology would cut development time and costsdramatically, since developers can gain a PM market presence now, and developfull-featured OS/2 applications later, according to the sources.andM;Sources compared the IBM/ Microsoft technology to that developed byMicrografx Inc. for its Mirrors, a Windows-to-PM application-developmentpackage (see related story at left).andM;Like Mirrors, the new technology employs a series of dynamic link libraries(DLLs) inside PM that intercept and translate Windows 2.1 or 3.0 calls into aPM context that OS/2 can act upon, sources said.andM;Also like Mirrors, such translations could slow the performance ofapplications in some cases, although sources said any penalty would benegligible.andM;While the DLL will translate applications written for Windows 2.1 or a futureversion known as 3.0, sources say users will be better off running packagesdesigned for the latter.andM;Windows 3.0, they said, requires developers to correct all memory-managementerrors and shortcuts used in developing 2.1 applications before theirsoftware will run in Windows 3.0's protected mode.andM;Without these changes, the DLL will not be able to translate the Windowscode, the sources said.andM;All &quot;clean&quot; Windows 2.1 and 3.0 applications, however, should run under PM inthis scheme without modification, sources said.andP;  Most commercial Windowsapplications are considered clean, they added.andM;The new IBM/Microsoft technology won't come without trade-offs, however,sources said.andP;  Like Mirrors, the technology does not let Windows applicationsexploit OS/2-specific features such as multithreading and Named Pipescommunications.andM;&quot;Of course, we'd like to eventually get Named Pipes and multithreadingservices in our OS/2 application, but that's just gravy,&quot; said ManufacturersHanover's Morse.andP;  &quot;We don't need all of that now.andP;  We can wait for thosefeatures, but not for the apps.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
