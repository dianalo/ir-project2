Whitehead will visit Algeria, Tunis and Morocco between May 9and 15, said spokesman Charles Redman. He will then travel to Parisfor talks with officials there and a meeting of the Organizationfor Economic Cooperation and Development, an association of themajor industrial countries.   In his talks in Algiers, Whitehead will ask for informationregarding the fate of the hijackers and the terms of the deal underwhich they released 31 hostages following their 16-day ordeal lastmonth.   Algeria has been reluctant to disclose details of the case,contending it must maintain its international credibility as acrisis negotiator.   Redman said the United States still does not have any indicationthat the hijackers left Algeria, despite news reports that theIranian-backed extremists traveled from Algiers to Syria and thento Lebanon.   U.S. officials said last week that Kuwait had apparentlyconveyed to the hijackers a promise that it would grant an earlyrelease to five of the 17 prisoners whose freedom was being soughtby the hijackers. The 17 were convicted in the 1983 bombings ofU.S. and French facilities in Kuwait.   The officials say Kuwait, which has denied making any deal,probably does not have any intention of keeping its promise. Theyalso say Syria has firmly denied that the hijackers came there fromAlgiers.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz praised Algeria formediating the hostages' release but criticized it for letting thehijackers get away.</TEXT></DOC>
