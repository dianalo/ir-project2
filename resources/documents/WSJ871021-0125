The rules, proposed in similar form in April, put into motion a program ordered by Congress last year for protecting schoolchildren from airborne asbestos fibers, which can cause lung cancer and other diseases.    By Oct. 12, 1988, the nation's 107,000 elementary and secondary schools, both public and private, are to be inspected for any materials containing asbestos, and maintenance or cleanup plans are to be submitted for state approval. Schools must begin cleanup or maintenance by July 1989. Roughly one-third of U.S. schools have asbestos problems, the EPA estimates, and the program could cost schools $3.1 billion over 30 years.    The EPA requires that specially trained, certified workers conduct the inspections and recommend protective measures. Critics argue that the rules could lead to unnecessary removal of asbestos, when safe and less-expensive options are available, because they don't set exposure standards and because they give too much discretion to workers conducting visual inspections. </TEXT></DOC>
