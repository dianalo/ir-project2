ShererandM;Amid all the hoopla about object-oriented programming and C++, early adoptersof the language are reporting a mix of strengths and weaknesses.andM;C++ makes it easier to reuse code and is better suited for large,multiprogrammer projects than its C language predecessor, according topioneer developers.andP;  On the downside, however, they report frustration withthe steep learning curve of C++ and the immaturity of some of the current C++products.andM;Despite these bottlenecks, though, most early users are sticking with thelanguage, recognizing its solid programming advances over C.andM;&quot;The benefits of C++ have been overhyped, but there are still real benefits,&quot;said Bryan Flamig, author of &quot;The Complete C++ Primer,&quot; a book on C++.andP;  &quot;C++has everything C has, but it gives you more flexibility in how you design aprogram,&quot; he said.andM;C++'s strong association with the much-ballyhooed object-oriented programming(OOP) methodology has overshadowed its other contributions, which includefundamental new features that help minimize bugs and manage large projects.andM;&quot;On a multiprogrammer project, C++ helps prevent bugs and subtleinteractions, [such as] using someone else's variables by mistake.andP;  These areprobably the hardest kind of bugs to find,&quot; explained Reed Shilts, principalengineer at Modicon Inc. in North Andover, Mass., a manufacturer ofprogrammable controllers for industrial automation.andM;C++'s OOP orientation does provide a host of enhancements, though, includingthe ability to easily modify finished programs.andM;&quot;The object-oriented methodology gives you a more bulletproof system,&quot; saidLarry Rosner, a senior programmer/analyst at Merrill, Lynch andamp; Co., aninvestment bank in New York.andP;  &quot;If something needs to change, you only need tochange an object.andP;  You can change things, and your system doesn't fallapart.&quot;andM;For those who have structured their object classes well, C++ fulfills itspromise of letting programmers reuse code more easily.andP;  &quot;I've seen a numberof people take code that I've written and very efficiently bring up new smallprograms using [that code],&quot; said Steven Miller, software architect at IBM'sCary Programming Laboratory in Cary, N.C.andM;Early users caution, however, that while the lure of C++ is potent, thelanguage is not an instant cure for development woes.andP;  It requiressignificant study and practice and a solid understanding of OOP conventionsto reap the language's full benefits, they said.andM;&quot;Using an object-oriented language in itself is not enough to give you allthe things it's been touted for, like code reusability and managing largesystems,&quot; Miller said.andP;  &quot;It's very important to use the proper designmethodology as well.andP;  Something written in [OOP] can be done just as poorly-- if not more poorly -- than in a non-object-oriented language like C.&quot;andM;Another stumbling block for C++ is the immaturity of early products.andP;  Some ofthe them, such as Glockenspiel Ltd.'s CommonView C++ development system, havebeen criticized by users for having poor documentation.andM;Other developers have shied away from C++ because they say it makes theirapplications larger than comparable C applications.andP;  &quot;C++ is more readableand easier to handle, but you're bringing along a lot of chaff when you useit,&quot; said Jim Gerow, vice president of research and development at AlphaSoftware Corp. in Burlington, Mass.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
