This techniquemakes use not only of the higher chemical reaction rate of H{sub 2}Swith alkanolamine solvents, but also of the inherent equipment selectivity.The selectivities of trayed and packed columns and several novel typeof contactor are compared, and mechanisms of selectivity discussed. Veryhigh selectivities calculated for cocurrent tubes may be a lead to improvedequipment, and hence improved process performance. 48 references.</TEXT></DOC>
