These sets of equations, which are hyperbolic, aretraditionally difficult to handle numerically. They were successfullysolved using FORSIM, a program package that implements the method oflines. Solutions have been obtained for one-dimensional transient model.Using this numerical technique, the propagation of continuity wave ispredicted by the one-dimensional transient model.</TEXT></DOC>
