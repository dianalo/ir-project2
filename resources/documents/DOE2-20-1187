Lower concentrations of aluminumsalts are effective in removing phosphorus. In order to determine ifaluminum salts in concentrations effective for phosphorus removal wouldalso be effective for removing heavy metals, three activated sludge sewagetreatment plants were studied for one month while using the aluminumsalt and then the following month after discontinuance of the alum orsodium aluminate addition. Statistically the only metal whose removalwas enhanced by the aluminum salt was copper. There appeared to be someremoval of lead and chromium but the correlation was masked by the largevariation in concentrations. Silver, arsenic, mercury, selenium, andzinc showed no enhanced removal. Beryllium, nickel, and thallium werenever detected.</TEXT></DOC>
