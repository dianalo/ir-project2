<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-15-1003 </DOCNO><TEXT>A key part of the waste management activities at the Hanford Site is disposalof the low-level fraction of radioactive liquid double-shell tank wastes.This waste type, total volume approximately 3 x 10{sup 5} m{sup 3}, hasbeen selected for shallow land disposal using a cement based grout wasteform. The development of the formulation for the cementitious materialsused to immobilize the waste required that the criteria for an acceptablewaste form be developed. The acceptance criteria for the waste form areseparated into requirements based on: (1) plant operating limits and(2) disposal system performance. The plant operating limits were determinedby a review of proposed plant design criteria. The disposal system performancerequirements were developed by reviewing applicable state and federalregulations and by modeling of long-term disposal system performance.The development of the formulation criteria and the methods used to developformulations that meet the established criteria are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
