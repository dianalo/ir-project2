Swanson, President of Applied PhysicsTechnology, Inc. (APT) entitled ``An Apparatus and Method for Using MicrowaveRadiation to Measure Water Content of a Fluid.''<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope</ITAG>This grant will be used to implement the patent design using a chirpedmicrowave signal ranging from 1 to 26 GH<T2>2</T2> in a half-scale laboratory bench model. Software will be developedto control the sweep rate of the microwave signal and calculate the oiland water content of text samples. The invention proposes instrumentationand measurement techniques for determining to a very high degree of accuracythe water, gas and oil content of petroleum shipments. The only directenergy benefit to be derived from this invention is the saving that wouldresult from higher efficiency separation of oil and water that would beencouraged by accurate measurement of water content. Energy would not beconsumed in the shipment of water around the world. Several indirect benefitswould accrue from this invention.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligibility</ITAG>Based on receipt of an unsolicited application, eligibility of this awardis being limited to Applied Physics Technology, Inc. Dr. Swanson, the inventor,is a physicist with expertise in the fields of electronics and microwavedesign, signals processing, hydrodynamics and software development. Dr.Swanson and his associates, the combined experience in relevant fieldstotal nearly 80 years, have the knowledge and experience to perform thework. It has been determined that this project has high technical meritand the technology, if successful, will make a major contribution to theefficiency of the petroleum industry which will result in a reduction inthe cost of energy to the American industry and consumers.The term of this grant shall be two years from the effective date of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, ATTN: Rosemarie Marshall, 1000 IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.<ITAG tagnum="6">Scott Sheffield,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Director, Contract Operations Division ``B'', Office of ProcurementOperations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-6927 Filed 3-22-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6550-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
