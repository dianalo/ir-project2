Rm. 227, CMandplusmin;2,1921 Jefferson Davis Highway, Arlington, VA 22202, (703)-557-1900.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>EPA issued a notice, published in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>of March 19, 1986 (51 FR 9514), which announcedthat Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., P.O. Box 12014, 2 T.W. Alexander Drive, ResearchTriangle Park, NC 27709, had submitted a pesticide petition (PP 6F3366)to EPA proposing that 40 CFR part 180 be amended by establishing tolerancesfor the combined residues of the fungicide iprodione [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-N-(1-methylethyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide],its isomer [3-(1-methylethyl)-N-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide],and its metabolite [3-(3,5-dichlorophenyl)-2,4-dioxo-1-imidazolidinecarboxamide]in or on potatoes at 0.5 part per million (ppm).A rule was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 8, 1988 (53 FR 21452) that establisheda tolerance for a period of 1 year from the date of publication of therule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Based on the review of the potato-processingdata, the Agency will determine whether the issuance of a permanent toleranceis appropriate. No comments were received in response to the rule.The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. Rhone-Poulenc, Inc., submitted a potato-processing study thatadequately demonstrates that iprodione, its isomer, and its metaboliteare not likely to concentrate in potato waste. Based on these data, thepublished tolerance that expired on June 8, 1989 for iprodione, its isomer,and its metabolite would adequately cover iprodione residues in potatoes.This document proposes to establish a permanent tolerance for iprodione,its isomer, and its metabolite in or on potatoes at 0.5 ppm.The toxicological data considered in support of the proposed toleranceinclude:1. A three-generation rat reproduction study using dosage levels of 0,250, 500, and 2,000 ppm with a no-observed-effect level (NOEL) of 500 ppm(25 milligrams per kilogram of body weight per day (mg/kg bwt/day)), areproductive lowest-effect level (LEL) of 2,000 ppm (100 mg/kg bwt/day),and a systemic NOEL equal to or greater than 2,000 ppm (100 mg/kg bwt/day);2. A rabbit teratology study in which the following doses were administeredby gavage: 0, 20, 60, and 200 mg/kg bwt, resulting in a teratogenic NOELequal to or greater than 60 mg/kg bwt;3. A rat teratology study in which the following doses were administeredby gavage: 0, 40, 90, and 200 mg/kg bwt, with a developmental toxicityNOEL equal to 90 mg/kg/bwt and an LEL of 200 mg/kg bwt;4. A 24-month feeding/oncogenicity study in rats using dosage levels of125, 250, and 1,000 ppm (6.25, 12.5, and 50 mg/kg bwt/day), which showedno oncogenic effects under the conditions of the study;5. An 18-month oncogenicity study in mice using dosage levels of 200, 500,and 1,250 ppm (28.6, 71.4, and 178.6 mg/kg bwt/day), which showed no oncogeniceffects under the conditions of the study.6. A 1-year dog feeding study using dosage levels of 168, 600, and 3,600ppm (4.2, 15, and 90 mg/kg bwt/day) with a NOEL of 168 ppm (4.2 mg/kg bwt/day)and an LEL of 600 ppm (15 mg/kg bwt/day); and7. A 90-day dog feeding study using dosage levels of 800, 2,400, and 7,200ppm (20, 60, and 180 mg/kg bwt/day) with a NOEL of 2,400 ppm (60 mg/kgbwt/day) and an LEL of 7,200 ppm (180 mg/kg bwt/day).Data currently lacking is an appropriate animal metabolism study. The registrantwill be submitting this study to the Agency by the end of 1989.The acceptable daily intake (ADI) based on the NOEL of 4.2 mg/kg bwt/dayfrom the 1-year dog feeding study and using a hundredfold safety factoris calculated to be 0.04 mg/kg bwt/day. The total exposure from the previouslyestablished tolerances using data on anticipated residues (estimate ofresidues of pesticides found on food at the time of consumption) from fieldstudies and percent crop treated data plus the proposed tolerance is 0.011223mg/kg bwt/day and utilizes 28.1 percent of the ADI for the overall U.S.population. The June 8, 1988 Federal Register Notice for Iprodione on potatoes statedthat the tolerance and the previously established tolerances utilize atotal of 109.4 percent of the ADI for the U.S. population; however, theAgency believes that the actual residues to which the public is likelyto be exposed are considerably less than indicated by the TMRC for thefollowing reasons:1. Not all the planted crop for which a tolerance is established is normallytreated with the pesticide.2. Most treated crops have residue levels which are below the establishedtolerance level.3. Not all crops contributing to the TMRC (PADI) are likely to be consumedby an individual. Therefore the Agency now used anticipated residues andpercent crop treated for the ADI anaylsis since this more accurately reflectsthe amount of pesticide residue likely to be consumed than does the tolerance.There are no regulatory actions pending against the registration of iprodione.The metabolism of iprodione in plants and animals, except for an appropriatetoxicology laboratory animal metabolism study as noted above, is adequatelyunderstood for purposes of the tolerance. An analytical method, gas liquidchromatography using an electron capture detector, is available in VolumeII of the ``Pesticide Analytical Manual'' for enforcement purposes. Based on the data and information considered by the Agency, it is concludedthat the pesticide is useful for the purposes for which the tolerance issought, and it is concluded that the proposed tolerance will protect thepublic health. Therefore, it is proposed that the tolerance be establishedas set forth below.As provided for in the Administrative Procedures Act (5. U.S.C. 553 (d)(3), the time for comment period is shortened to less than 30 days becauseof the necessity to expeditiously provide a means to control sclerotiniaon potatoes.Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedregulation. Comments must bear a notation indicating the document controlnumber, [PP 6F3366/P487]. All written comments filed in response to thispetition will be available in the Public Docket and Freedom of InformationSection, at the address given above from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday throughFriday, except legal holidays.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164, 5 U.S.C. 601-612), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from tolerance requirements do not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. A certificationstatement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects In 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Recording and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: August 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
