Orders for machine tools so far this year have been lower than company officials expected when the year began, said James A.D. Geier, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;Unless there is a resurgence of the industrial economy that translates into orders we can ship before year-end,&quot; Mr. Geier said, the $1.25-a-share estimate may be optimistic.    Milacron's sales in 1987 will rise 10% from the $850 million of 1986, Mr. Geier estimated. Net last year was $23.3 million.    Machine tools account for about 45% of Milacron's sales. Orders in May so far have been &quot;encouraging&quot; after being mostly sluggish earlier in the year, one official said.    Milacron's machine tool operations are profitable despite competitive pricing and sluggish orders, Mr. Geier said, partly because of a restructuring over the past two years that has sharply reduced overhead and operating costs.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Milacron shares closed at $31.25, up $1.50.    Demand is strong for plastics machinery, which makes up nearly 25% of Milacron's sales, the company said. &quot;We cover more than 50% of the plastics machinery market now, and we would like to build that to 75% to 80%,&quot; Mr. Geier said. The acquisition last year of Sano Inc. brought Milacron into the plastic film machinery market, he said, and there are other areas of the industry where it would like to make acquisitions.    Demand for industrial robots has been reduced by a spending cutback at General Motors Corp., Milacron said. The company said, however, it is winning additional business at Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. and is working to develop robot markets outside the auto industry.    Directors are unlikely to change the dividend, which has been 72 cents annually since 1981, Mr. Geier said. The company has been conservative about raising dividends when profit was high &quot;to establish a level we felt we could defend&quot; in lower profit periods, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
