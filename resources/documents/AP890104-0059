(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The University of Connecticut's fleet isshort one remote-controlled submarine.   The submarine, insured for $71,100, sank in 378 feet of water onDec. 9 off the island of Molokai in Hawaii when its control cablesnapped, officials said.   The submarine, measuring about 2 feet by 3 feet by 2 feet, is``essentially a camera with some motors on it,'' Peter J. Auster ofUConn's National Undersea Research Center said today.   The school said the loss should not affect research projectsplanned for this summer in Africa, Israel and off the East Coast.   UConn had two submarines; the lost vessel was the school'sbackup, Auster said. In addition, the university expects delivertynext month of another submarine, and has only one submarine pilotanyway, he said.   The submarine was tethered to a surface ship when its cablebecame snagged, Auster said. He said the ship's crew tried to freethe cable, but it broke.   Auster said a University of Hawaii crew will probably attempt torecover the vessel next month.   The vehicle was on loan to the University of Hawaii, which, alongwith UConn, is among five U.S. schools with undersea researchcenters supported by the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, Auster said.</TEXT></DOC>
