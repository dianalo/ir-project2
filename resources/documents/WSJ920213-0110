The Wall Street Journal has taken up this familiartopic with a vengeance. An example is John H. Fund's Nov. 6article, &quot;Liberals for Term Limits.&quot; Mr. Fund sayscongressional term limitation enjoys wide support rangingbeyond the Republican Party.   Mr. Fund's is the right answer to the wrong question. Theoverriding question is: Can states limit congressional termswithout violating the Constitution?</LP><TEXT>   The term-limit debate has ricocheted around the nation athousand times, tracing the same confining arguments withlittle reference to the Constitution's text, structure andhistory.   At first, I was predisposed to believe Stephen Glazier,William Mellor and others who have argued in these pages thatAmerica's Founding Fathers reserved to the states theauthority to restrict congressional tenure either explicitly,through Article I, Sec. 4, which empowers states to regulatethe &quot;Times, Places and Manner&quot; of congressional elections, orimplicitly, through the 10th Amendment's guarantee thatstates retain those powers not delegated to the federalgovernment.   But then I began sifting through the record. The findings,which appear this spring in the Denver University Law Review,weaken the argument that state-imposed term limits areconstitutional.   In the article, co-author Troy Andrew Eid and I giveevidence that James Madison and other Federalists stronglyopposed term limits for U.S. senators and representatives.They did so both at the Constitutional Convention of 1787 andlater in the fight over what was to become the Bill ofRights. Indeed, even the most ardent proponents of termlimits -- men such as anti-Federalist leader William Findley,who urged his fellow Pennsylvanians to defeat the proposedConstitution in 1787 because of its failure to limitcongressional terms -- nonetheless agreed that the documentas ratified forbids both Congress and the states fromtampering with the congressional eligibility requirements ofage, residency and citizenship, the &quot;standing qualifications&quot;listed in Article I.   As judicial conservatives, we cannot brush aside theintentions of the Constitution's framers. Federalists andanti-Federalists were not only aware of the controversy, butfought it out in debates that offer thoughts for today'sdialogue.   The Federalists won that fight. Virginia's EdmundRandolph, who first proposed term limits for representativesat the Philadelphia Convention, was forced to delete thisprovision from the draft ultimately submitted to the statesfor ratification. Indeed, delegates such as Elbridge Gerry ofMassachusetts deserted the convention partly because themajority had rejected term limits for the Senate.   Term-limit proposals for senators and representativesresurfaced at the state ratifying conventions beginning in1788. New York, Virginia and North Carolina proposed amendingthe U.S. Constitution to limit both congressional andpresidential terms. During the First Congress, Rep. ThomasTucker of South Carolina introduced term-limit measures forboth House and Senate. His proposals found no support.   Why did the Founders, who were justifiably fearful oflegislative power given their experience with the &quot;ImperialParliament,&quot; nonetheless consistently oppose congressionalterm limits? One explanation is that they had seen how KingGeorge III had manipulated the standing qualifications toexclude popular reformers such as John Wilkes from serving inParliament. Accordingly, Alexander Hamilton declared thatCongress's membership rules &quot;are defined and fixed in theConstitution; they are unalterable by the legislature.&quot;   The Founders, moreover, believed frequent elections, whichMadison called &quot;the cornerstone of liberty,&quot; would be asufficient safeguard to congressional abuses of power.Whereas members of Parliament served seven-year terms, U.S.representatives (the only popularly elected lawmakers underthe original constitution) faced re-election every two years.Madison and his allies were also wary of legislativeinexperience, particularly in foreign affairs. In FederalistNo. 53, Madison not only predicted some House members wouldbe returned to office repeatedly, but argued that theirre-election would benefit Congress as a whole. Speaking ofthe House, Madison wrote: &quot;The greater the proportion of newmembers, and the less the information of the bulk of themembers, the more apt will they be to fall into the snaresthat may be laid for them.&quot;   While the framers' sentiments may strike us as surprising,it bears remembering that these men were not populists in anymodern sense. They fought against &quot;pure democracy,&quot; whichMadison rejected in Federalist No. 10. He argued in favor ofa republican legislature that would &quot;refine and enlarge thepublic views, by passing them through the medium of a chosenbody of citizens, whose wisdom may best discern the trueinterest of their country, and whose patriotism and love ofjustice, will be least likely to sacrifice it to temporary orpartial considerations.&quot;   We suspect Madison would agree that there is too littlewisdom, patriotism and love of justice in today's Congress.The Founders would no doubt be shocked by many of our &quot;careerpoliticians&quot; (even though several of them, includingoutspoken term-limit supporter Gerry, devoted much of theiradult lives to legislative service). Nonetheless, the framershad the foresight to create a remedy that later generationshave used when constitutional democracy breaks down. ArticleV, which establishes the procedure for amending theConstitution, permits Congress to propose its own term-limitamendment. It was this procedure that was used to limit thepresident to two terms. Alternatively, Article V grants thestates the right to convene a constitutional convention to dothe job.   In fact, the term-limit movement is likely to win battlesin many states, but lose the war in the U.S. Supreme Court.State supreme courts have heard cases involving the issue,but postponed the constitutional challenge. The U.S.Constitution is the sole instrument that provides theauthority to embrace term limits.   Ironically, some conservatives argue that changedcircumstances in contemporary political life justify readingthe standing qualifications out of the Constitutionsurreptitiously by inventing a substantive component toArticle I, Sec. 4. This trendy view of interpreting theConstitution is an argument conservatives have rejectedbefore and should reject again. The &quot;Times, Places andManner&quot; clause, as understood by its framers and interpretedby the courts ever since, regulates election procedures andnot the substance of office-holding. Reading a proceduralprovision substantively brings to mind the discredited&quot;substantive due process&quot; jurisprudence fashionable amongsome left-wing judicial activists.   Those who have proposed term limits should resist the urgeto make an end run around the Constitution and focus insteadon amending it as provided by Article V. Times change, butthe wisdom of our Founding Fathers never goes out of style.   ---   Rep.
