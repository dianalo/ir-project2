The aerospace concern said it expects Federal Aviation Administration certification to be received in time to meet the previous schedule of deliveries to begin in December. As previously reported, any delays in the delivery schedule could push into 1989 about $500 million of Boeing revenue. A total of 124 of the planes, which sell for between $110 million and $129 million each, have been ordered for delivery through May 1991.    The 747-400, Boeing's biggest jetliner, is designed to carry more than 500 passengers on non-stop trips of 8,000 miles.    The two-hour, 26-minute initial flight Friday tested handling and buffet characteristics and instrumentation at an altitude of about 20,000 feet, Boeing said. A company spokeswoman said the pilots didn't encounter any problems with the plane. </TEXT></DOC>
