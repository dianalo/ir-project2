Ask Julie Klein, case manager for the Battered Women'sShelter in Akron, Ohio. She was more than happy when a localbusiness offered to raise $5,000 for the cash-starvedshelter. With such a windfall, the shelter wouldn't have togo begging to foundations and deep-pocketed residents to helphouse nearly 1,000 women and children a year.</LP><TEXT>   The problem was that the business was a local stripteaseservice and the fundraiser a 55-hour strip-a-thon.   Womens' rights groups cringed, and local residents blastedboth the shelter and the sponsor over local radio shows.&quot;This bump-and-grind fund-raiser perpetuates the myths whichlead women to battered homes in the first place,&quot; says SharonRety, president of the Cleveland chapter of the NationalOrganization for Women.   Ms. Klein counters that the shelter was only accepting adonation, not sponsoring the event, which was held lastmonth. &quot;It wasn't exploitation, it was a fund-raiser,&quot; sheinsists.   Meanwhile, Tom Jenkins, president of Strippers Elite Inc.,Hudson, Ohio, tried to defuse the controversy by pointing outthat the performers, a male and a female, were stripping downonly to their bathing suits. &quot;You could have easily hadsomebody going stark naked. We are not that kind oforganization,&quot; he says. &quot;One of our former secretaries works{at the shelter} and she knew we are professional.&quot;   But the shelter was the only charitable organizationwilling to accept the donations. The United Cerebral PalsyAssociation of Greater Cleveland, the Greater Cleveland FoodBank and the Veteran's Center of Cleveland Heights said no.   Meanwhile, Mr. Jenkins had been hoping that the eventwould earn Strippers Elite a mention in the &quot;Guinness Book ofWorld Records&quot; for continuous striptease. He's still not surewhether the dancers set a new mark for striptease, but theycertainly didn't break any fund-raising records. In fact, thestriptease was a money-raising bust.   Instead of generating $5,000, the 55 hours of dancingfetched only $623 -- including tips. Mr. Jenkins said thecompany would kick in enough extra money to give the sheltera total of about $1,000.   Does he plan any other fund-raisers? &quot;Not immediately,&quot; hesays. &quot;But there is a belly-dancing record we could go for.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
