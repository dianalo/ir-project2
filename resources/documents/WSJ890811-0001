The rally was most evident in U.S. futures trading, where crude oil broke through the technically-important $18.50-a-barrel level.    On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery traded as high as $18.70 a barrel. It settled at $18.59, up 38 cents for the day. October and November futures contracts for the U.S. benchmark crude were up 32 cents and 29 cents a barrel, respectively.    Futures prices of petroleum products also increased. Unleaded gasoline for September delivery rose 0.85 cent a gallon to settle at 51.43 cents. September heating oil was up 0.78 cent a gallon to settle at 50.21 cents.    The stronger petroleum prices were reflected in refiners' postings in the oil fields. Although the field prices for West Texas Intermediate still trail those in spot and futures markets, several refiners yesterday advanced their postings for the crude by 25 cents a barrel to $17.50.    There also was noticeable strength in oil markets outside the U.S. Some analysts, in fact, called it a European-led rally. They cited reports of tighter supplies of North Sea Brent crude resulting from an alleged accumulation of August cargos by a major trader.    Whatever the reason, prices of North Sea crudes were 30 cents to 35 cents a barrel higher on European spot markets, according to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. Similar increases were reported for North African and Middle Eastern crudes.    But despite yesterday's gains, petroleum prices still have a long way to go to reach the levels of only a month ago, when oil prices were $1.50 to $2 a barrel higher. And there is considerable skepticism as to how long the current rally might last. Some analysts suggested petroleum demand may be weakening in the third quarter, and others cited the continuing high production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. OPEC output is currently estimated at 21.5 million barrels a day, or two million above the second-half production ceiling of 19.5 million.    &quot;Can this market continue to roll ahead without the underpinnings of strong fundamentals?&quot; asked Nauman Barakat, a first vice president of Shearson Lehman Hutton.    One positive factor for oil markets is that gasoline consumption seems to be picking up again in the U.S., said Philip L. Dodge, an oil analyst with Nomura Securities International. Still, he said, &quot;This (rally) is a temporary reprieve from a negative trend.&quot;    In other commodity markets yesterday:    COPPER: Futures prices rose on actual and potential mine production problems. The September delivery rose 1.55 cents a pound to $1.1225. The big Bougainville mine in Papua New Guinea, now may not be ready to resume operations by year's end, if then, because of continuing attacks by rebel landowners, said Fred Demler, metals economist for Drexel Burnham Lambert, New York. In Chile, Mr. Demler noted, there are drought problems, which have brought about a 10% cut in power that will affect mining operations. Miners in Peru on Monday will begin an indefinite strike, he said. There were problems in Africa, as well. In Zambia, miners were reported to have set fire to a union office because they were angry about a 12% wage increase negotiated for them by the union, Mr. Demler said. This increase contrasted with boosts of as much as 50% being given to government workers, he said. In Zaire, International Monetary Fund investigators are reported to be checking a loss of $400 million in foreign exchange earned by copper exports, according to Mr. Demler. Copper is Zaire's main export and that country is asking for financial aid from the IMF, Mr. Demler said. On the demand side, Japan and China have been good buyers of copper, he said, and dealer premiums continue to hold at 4.5 cents to five cents over the corresponding futures positions. As for supplies, copper inventories in warehouses of the London Metal Exchange have recently risen, Mr. Demler said, but global stocks are down from earlier this year. &quot;There will be a modest increase in supplies over the next few weeks, but with the actual and potential loss of production, the industry may not be in a position to deal with the seasonal upturn in demand in the fall,&quot; he said.    SUGAR: Futures prices eased. The October contract ended 0.22 cent a pound lower at 13.85 cents. &quot;It was the same old story: An early rally ran into trade selling,&quot; an analyst said. The expectations that India may be a big buyer of sugar on the world market appear to have lost some impact. &quot;That's not to say that India won't buy, but the indications are that it hasn't bought, and this is contributing to the softer tone. This is being indicated by the fact that the October delivery's premium over March has tended to narrow slightly recently. If there had been any purchases by India, or the immediate expectation of any, the October price would have risen sharply, and the premium would have widened,&quot; the analyst said. Another analyst said that the market remained without any fundamental developments and that the decline was mostly technical in nature. When the October price dropped below 14 cents a pound, selling orders that had been placed around that level were touched off, accelerating the decline, he said.    ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rose. The September contract ended 5.65 cents a pound higher at $1.602. Cash prices for the concentrate remained firm, which contributed to the rise in futures, an analyst said. However, she added, the longer-term picture still is bearish, based on expectations of a large Brazilian orange crop. Another analyst, Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds, Chicago, said the ability of the cashmarket prices to hold while futures prices were easing, since the start of this month, triggered renewed demand for futures. &quot;The selling in futures was somewhat overdone, and the fact that futures prices were at a discount to those in the cash market attracted some demand from processors,&quot; he said. Those purchases, in turn, touched off aggressive buying back of contracts by traders who had previously sold short in anticipation of declining prices, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
