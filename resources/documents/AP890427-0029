RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Both sides of the abortion issue are findinggrounds for hope as they await a Supreme Court ruling in a keyMissouri case that could alter the right of women to end theirpregnancies.   Frank Susman, a St. Louis lawyer who urged the court Wednesdayto strike down a Missouri law restricting abortions, said he is notconceding any votes among the nine justices.   ``I have given up on no one,'' he told reporters after thehour-long argument session that packed the courtroom and drew morethan 200 demonstrators and spectators outside the court building.   Twenty-seven ``pro-choice'' protesters were arrested forbreaking through police barriers that lined the court building'splaza.   Referring to the court's 1973 ruling in Roe vs. Wade decisionthat legalized abortion nationwide, Susman said he believed thejustices are now aware ``Roe works. You cannot put the cork back inthe bottle. You can't turn the clock back 16 years.''   Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who urged the courtto uphold the state's abortion regulations even if it does notreverse the broader 1973 decision, also said he was pleased withthe arguments.   ``To the extent Roe works, you have to ask yourself why we arestanding in front of the court'' 13 years after the case wasdecided and after numerous subsequent court rulings on abortion,Webster said.   He said the Missouri regulations are a lot less severe than the``pro-choice'' forces claim and stop far short of outlawingabortions.   ``The debate has been polarized and exploited. Frankly, (theMissouri law) just doesn't go that far,'' he said.   Harvard law professor Charles Fried, a former top Reaganadministration official, argued in behalf of the Bushadministration. He urged the court to overturn its 1973 ruling, butdeclined to speak to reporters outside the courtroom after theargument session.   The justices, who do not necessarily have to reconsider Roe vs.Wade in resolving the Missouri dispute, gave little indication ofhow broad their decision will be. They are expected to announcetheir ruling by July.   At one point, Justice Antonin Scalia _ a potential swing votealong with Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony M. Kennedy _asked whether the court must consider the nature of a fetus.   ``Can you derive (a fundamental right to abortion) withoutmaking a determination as to whether the fetus is human life ornot?'' Scalia asked the lawyers.   The justices will take their initial vote in the Missouri caseFriday in a closed-door meeting. They will discuss their views,beginning a process that will include drafting and redraftingopinions.   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,said she was heartened by the discussion before the justicesbecause it focused in part on the link between abortion rights andcontraception rights.   ``We've said all along the right to privacy is the same'' inboth cases, she said.   She and others in the abortion battle agreed the court's ruling,while potentially momentous, will not be the last word.   Kate Michelman, executive director of the National AbortionRights Action League, said, ``While the attention of the nationalpress is on the Supreme Court today, it is important to keep inmind that pro-choice activities are occurring all across thecountry. We must take our message to the public today and tomorrowand every day until we settle this issue once and for all.''   James Bopp, general counsel to the National Right to LifeCommittee, said opponents of the Missouri law ``are seeking toexpand the right to abortion. The question is whether the court isready to make that right more absolute.''   A federal appeals court, relying on Roe vs. Wade, struck downmajor provisions of the Missouri law as unconstitutional. The lawbanned use of public hospitals for performing abortions notnecessary to save a woman's life; prohibited any public employeefrom performing or assisting an abortion or ``encouraging orcounseling'' women to have abortions; and required doctors todetermine whether a fetus older than 19 weeks is capable ofsurviving outside the womb by, for example, testing lung maturity.</TEXT></DOC>
