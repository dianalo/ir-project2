In this work the authors undertook an attempt to test thehypothesis that the heterogeneous chemical factors predominate by simulatingthe corresponding processes on a computer. The systems chosen for simulationwere hydrogen-air (12% H{sub 2}) and methane-air (10% CH{sub 4} in themixture) flames at atmospheric pressure inhibited by nonvaporizing solidparticles with a diameter d = 50 {mu}m. The mathematical model of a one-dimensionalstationary flame propagating in a stream of solid particles with a constantvelocity included the basic differential equations of heat conduction,of the diffusion of the components of the mixture, and of the continuityof the gaseous flow. For the purpose of describing inhibited flames,steps corresponding to the heterogeneous destruction of the active centerson the surfaces of the solid particles were added to the schemes presented.The rate constants of the heterogeneous steps indicated were describedwith the use of a modified version of Frank-Kamenetskii's formula.</TEXT></DOC>
