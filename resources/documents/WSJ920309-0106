Political analysts say the results of the by-electionspell trouble for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party in aregular Upper House election scheduled for July. Heavy lossesin that contest would likely force Mr. Miyazawa to step down,and some analysts believe he may be pushed out even beforethen.</LP><TEXT>   In results announced late Sunday night, Koki Hagino, acandidate running under the banner of the Rengo laborfederation and backed by the Socialist and DemocraticSocialist parties, defeated LDP candidate Nobuo Onodera by396,532 votes to 393,615, according to Kyodo news service.   Despite the narrow margin, the loss &quot;has to be a bigshock&quot; to the LDP, said political analyst Takayoshi Miyagawa,who attributed the results to political scandals and tofarmers' fears that the government is preparing to liberalizeJapan's protected rice market. Mr. Miyagawa said he believesthe LDP poured &quot;three to five times the usual amount ofmoney&quot; into the campaign. &quot;They pulled out all the stops, andstill they got beat,&quot; in a rural prefecture that had been astronghold for the ruling party until a Socialist candidatecaptured the Upper House seat three years ago amid a previousround of scandals.   Coupled with an LDP loss last month in another Upper Houseby-election in Nara prefecture, the Miyagi results cast apall over the LDP's chances in July. Mr. Miyagawa said LDPleaders are likely to consider dissolving the Lower House andholding simultaneous elections for both chambers -- a tacticthat could damp the party's overall losses, given itstraditional strength in the lower chamber.   Even so, the LDP's position looks ominously similar tothat of three years ago, when the party lost its majority inthe Upper House as voters vented their anger at thewidespread Recruit Co. influence-peddling scandal and a newconsumption tax. Although the LDP's continued Lower Housemajority enables it to pass budgetrelated bills, the LDP hashad to work with two moderate opposition parties to winapproval of other legislation.   Further heavy losses this summer could mean thatcenter-right coalition will no longer command a majority inthe upper chamber -- a prospect that some analysts nowconsider likely. In that event, the conservative,pro-business LDP would probably be forced to form anunprecedented coalition in the Upper House with theSocialists, a leftist party that has been trying to edgetoward the political mainstream.</TEXT></DOC>
