Foreign Minister Hussein Abu-Saleh of Sudan appealed forinternational help at a news conference in his country's capital onSunday night, the Egyptian state-owned news agency said.   Later today the news agency reported a serious food shortagethreatened Khartoum but that ``fewer than a dozen'' people died inthe floods Thursday and Friday.   Cairo newspapers reported dozens of deaths in Sudan, some byelectrocution caused by broken power cables falling into floodwaters.   The Middle East News Agency also reported anti-government riotsin some districts of Khartoum and said some schools anduniversities were closed.   The agency quoted Sudanese officials as saying the floods werethe worst there since 1946.   In its unattributed report, the Egyptian agency painted a grimpicture of the situation in Khartoum.   ``Public utilities in the capital continue to suffer from almostcomplete paralysis for the third straight day,'' the report said.   Khartoum's official Omdurman Radio has gone off the air, thereport said, and only a provincial government-owned radio stationat Wad Medani, 100 miles southeast of the capital, is broadcastingfor a few hours daily.   Abu-Saleh said Khartoum, the eastern cities of Kassala andShowak and the northern city of El-Damer were declared disasterareas because of the flooding. Sudan's finance minister, Omar NourEl-Dayem ,was quoted as saying about 1 million people were lefthomeless because the floods destroyed thousands of dwellings. Hesaid 5,000 houses were washed away in the Khartoum area alone.   Sudan has a population of about 23 million.   Kassala, capital of the eastern province, is 250 miles east ofKhartoum. El-Damer lies 160 miles northeast of the capital.   ``Entire villages and districts have been isolated by theflooding, and rescue forces have not been able to reach thembecause of the high water level,'' Abu-Saleh was quoted as saying.He did not identify the affected areas.   The ministers said flood waters cut telephone and telexcommunications and caused power failures which, in turn, disruptedpublic utilities.   President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt ordered immediate relief forSudan, which traditionally has had close ties with Egypt.   Five Egyptian C-130 military transport planes flew in tents,medical supplies and food on Sunday. Another five planeloads wentto Khartoum today.   The flooding has compounded Sudan's economic difficulties, whichinclude a chronic balance of payments deficit and a $12 billionforeign debt.   For several years, the country has been suffering from foodshortages, including bread, increased commodity prices anddeficient public utilities.   These problems frequently touched off public unrest. Last weekpeople rioted in Khartoum on three successive days to protest waterand bread shortages and electric power cuts. Police used tear gasto disperse the rioters who had set fire to tires on the streets.</TEXT></DOC>
