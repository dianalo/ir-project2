Factions in the scandal-ridden Liberal Democratic Party wereexpected to declare their support Thursday for Toshiki Kaifu, aformer education minister who became the front-runner Wednesday tosucceed resigning Prime Minister Sousuke Uno.   The party's largest group, the Takeshita faction, indicated itwill support Kaifu for party president, who is assured election asprime minister by the Liberal Democratic-dominated lower house ofParliament.   But members of a faction led by former Finance Minister KiichiMiyazawa, decided the closed-door meetings from which Kaifu'scandidancy emerged ``will disappoint the public,'' a factionspokesman said.   ``This method of selecting a party president is not good for theparty or for the people,'' the spokesman said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   An election for party president is scheduled for Tuesday, butparty officials say Kaifu could be declared winner without a ballotif no other candidates enter before Saturday's deadline.   The vote in the lower house of Parliament is expected Aug. 10.The upper house does not vote for prime minister.   ``We believe there should be at least one other candidate forthe party presidency, and will do our best to turn it into a realelection,'' the Miyazawa spokesman said.   Kaifu, a 10-term lower house member, officially announced hiscandidacy Wednesday after his faction's leader, Toshio Komoto, 78,was persuaded by other faction leaders not to run. Party officialshave said the party needs a younger image for upcoming lower houseelections.   Analysts say Kaifu, 58, also was favored because party eldersbelieve he will not threaten their own future bids for leadershipsince he has a small power base.   The conservative governing party's five major factions aredifferentiated more by personal and financial allegiances than bypolitical differences.   Shin Kanemaru, chairman of the Takeshita faction, indicated itwill back Kaifu but postponed an official statement of support.   ``Kaifu is an excellent person and a suitable candidate for thepresidency. But other candidates may emerge, so we want to wait tomake a final decision,'' the Japan Broadcasting Corp. quoted him assaying after a faction meeting.   Uno announced his resignation after only two months in officebecause of the party's heavy losses in elections July 23 for theupper house of Parliament. Uno also had come under criticism afterallegations he kept paid mistresses.   Kaifu acknowledged Wednesday he received about $110,000 inpolitical donations in five years from the Recruit Co., the firm atthe center of a scandal that brought down Uno's predecessor, NoboruTakeshita.   But he said the donations were properly reported and that hereceived no stock shares from the information and publishingconglomerate.   The company allegedly provided millions of dollars in politicalcontributions and bargain-priced stocks to prominent people toobtain favors.   From 1974 to 1976, Kaifu served as deputy chief Cabinetsecretary under the late Prime Minister Takeo Miki. He later alsoserved as education minister for two periods totaling about twoyears.   Party officials have said the new party leader will serve onlythe remainder of Takeshita's original term, which ends Oct. 31. Theparty then will hold a new election.</TEXT></DOC>
