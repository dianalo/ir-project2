Francis A. Ennis of the University of Massachusetts MedicalSchool said that in test tube studies his group found that the humanimmunodeficiency virus, or HIV, that causes AIDS may hitch a ride ona type of antibody in order to infect certain types of cells andspread throughout the body.   ``These antibodies can provide the virus a Trojan horse mechanismwhereby the virus can enter certain cells,'' said Ennis. ``It's amechanism by which antibodies that usually prevent a virus frominfecting the cell are actually helping the virus get into the cellto infect.''   Ennis said the antibody study was conducted using serum, a clearfluid in blood, that was taken from patients who were known to haveAIDS.   He said the serum was first diluted by a ratio of 1 part serum to100 parts sterile water and then exposed to human cells in a testtube. At that concentration, said Ennis, there were enoughantibodies attacking or blocking the AIDS virus to prevent it frommultiplying in new cells. Antibodies that act in this way are saidto be neutralizing antibodies.   However, when the serum was further diluted, in ratios from1-to-1,000 and higher, the neutralizing antibodies could no longercontrol the AIDS spread. Instead, another type of antibody, calledan enhancing antibody, became dominant and the AIDS virus was ableto invade and infect new cells.   Ennis said the pathway used to invade the cells was differentfrom the generally accepted infection method. A number of studieshave shown that the HIV virus enters certain cells by binding with aprotein on the cell's surface called the CD4 receptor.   In Ennis' study, his group demonstrated that the virus can alsoenter certain cells that have another type of surface proteinreceptor, called the Fc.   The study showed that the virus rides into the cells through theFc receptor by first attaching itself to immunoglobulin G, a largemolecule that is one of the body's main defenses against bacteria.   Immunoglobulin G, said Ennis, is a Y-shaped molecule that carriesthe Fc receptor on the main stem of the Y. He said it can join withthe AIDS virus, cradling the killer between the arms of the Y, andthen enter cells through the Fc receptor, carrying the AIDS virus inwith it.   ``We think there is an antibody response to the virus that isdetrimental and that some of these antibodies that bind to the virusactually help the virus infect cells,'' said Ennis. ``The patientswould be better off if they didn't have those antibodies.''   Cells used in the study were monocytes and macrophages, which areimmunity cells that are known to be attacked by the AIDS virus inpatients who have the disease. These cells have both the Fc and theCD4 receptors.   More studies will be required, he said, before scientists candetermine precisely what role immunoglobulin G has in theprogression of AIDS in patients. The studies by Ennis' group wereconducted in test tubes, but the scientist said this newunderstanding may have to be taken into consideration in the designof a vaccine against AIDS.   Dr. Robert C. Gallo, a National Institutes of Health scientistand co-discoverer of the AIDS virus, said the finding has beenconfirmed, but not published by other groups.   ``It has implications that could be quite important,'' he said.``It could be of clinical relevance'' because it may have to betaken into consideration in developing drugs to fight AIDS.   AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, is a contagiousdisease that destroys the body's immune system and makes itincapable of resisting other diseases and infections. The virus mostoften is spread through close contact with blood, blood products orsemen from infected persons.   As of Oct. 17, AIDS had been diagnosed in 75,768 Americans ofwhom 42,653 had died. No one is known to have recovered from AIDS.   Science, which published the study today, is the journal for theAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science.
