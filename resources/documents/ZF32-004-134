(Product introduction).andO;Product:   TypeReader (Scanning software) (Product introduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionOptical character recognition software.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Erica SchroederandM;ExperVision Inc. will next month introduce TypeReader, a Windows opticalcharacter recognition program that has impressed early users with its smoothinterface and the ability to tap Adobe Type Manager.andM;&quot;The interface is ...andP;  quite an improvement over andlsqb;Caere Corp.'sandrsqb; OmniPage,&quot;said beta tester Christian Del Prete, systems administrator for MaxwellElectronic Publishing Inc., a Cambridge, Mass., publishing company.andP;  Inparticular, Type-Reader includes icons that allow users to access commonlyused commands with a click of the mouse, he said.andM;Other users agreed.andP;  &quot;It's elegant, especially for the first-time user, andtakes good advantage of Windows,&quot; said Mike Heylin, senior associate forCreative Strategies Research International, a research firm in Santa Clara,Calif.andM;Users also liked the on-screen verifier, which displays an unrecognizedscanned image in a way that users can correct without having to refer to theoriginal document.andM;&quot;I especially like the way it goes through the identification of problems andlsqb;inrecognitionandrsqb;,&quot; Heylin said.andP;  &quot;It uses color to highlight problems and letsyou correct things on the fly.andP;  It's not another step.&quot;andM;The ability to use ATM with TypeReader allows users to preserve type fonts,sizes and styles of the original for use in Windows applications.andM;&quot;It is an advantage,&quot; said Del Prete.andP;  &quot;It's really easy to switch the fonts.andO;We want to get closest to the original font, andlsqb;and with ATMandrsqb; we can throw adocument right back into andlsqb;Microsoft Corp.'sandrsqb; Word for Windows.&quot;andM;TypeReader also preserves most of the formatting of the original, includingmargins, tabs, tables and columns.andM;&quot;It does a good job with tables; it's not perfect, but it surprised me acouple of times with its ability andlsqb;to recognize difficult charactersandrsqb;,&quot; saidDel Prete.andM;On the down side, users said the handling of connected characters in somefonts is poorly implemented.andM;&quot;It's a little bit clumsy with the fonts; sometimes it will crush characterstogether so they are illegible,&quot; said Del Prete.andM;Other features that users would like to see improved are automatic windowresizing and better documentation.andM;TypeReader works with a variety of scanners and allows users to export filesinto applications such as WordPerfect Corp.'s WordPerfect, Microsoft Excel,Word and Word for Windows, Lotus Development Corp.'s Ami Professional andLotus 1-2-3, as well as RTF, ASCII and Smart ASCII, said officials of the SanJose, Calif., company.andM;TypeReader, the company's first commercial product, will be priced at $895and is slated to be shipped later this month.andM;ExperVision is a privately held company that can be reached at (408)428-9444.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
