Soviet-made armored personnel carriers, American-made trucks,jeeps and artillery and Chinese ``Liberation'' troop transportvehicles clogged the 20-foot-wide stretch of highway for 120 milesfrom Cambodia's capital, Phnom Penh, to the Vietnamese border.   Traffic on the road that Vietnam used as one of its maininvasion in December 1978 came to a standstill.   Soldiers, stripped to their undershorts, hung hammocks undertrucks, cooked rice by the side of the road, and draped theirlaundry from anti-aircraft guns on the final night before theborder crossing begins.   ``I am very happy to be returning home to my family,'' said onesoldier from Thai Binh province. ``I have been in Cambodia for 10years and seen my wife only three times.''   Peasants gathered by the side of the road and waved to thetroops, whose uniforms were decorated with flowers and medals.Speakers set up for the occasion blared the Vietnamese-Cambodian``friendship'' song and patriotic speeches, which were prepared forthe government-orchestrated ceremony.   Starting Tuesday, Vietnamese troops will return home overland,by ferry on the Mekong River and via the Gulf of Thailand.   Vietnam says it is withdrawing the last 26,000 of its troops inCambodia and ending its occupation of its Southeast Asian neighbor.   The Cambodian resistance movement calls the pullout a sham, butalready Khmer Rouge guerrillas have attacked a town in westernCambodia in an apparent attempt to challenge the Cambodian army, nolonger aided by Vietnamese troops.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Bouchersaid Monday that although the Vietnamese occupation is apparentlyending, ``We believe that Vietnam cannot evade its responsibilityto help achieve a comprehensive political solution in Cambodia.''   As for the prospect of a return to power by the communist KhmerRouge, Boucher said this problem can best be dealt with throughnegotiations and a comprehensive political solution.   On Monday, Khmer Rouge radio broadcasts monitored in Bangkokclaimed the guerrillas had seized a ``strategic position'' on theroad from the western town, Pailin, to the provincial capital ofBattambang.   Cambodian officials acknowledged recently that Khmer Rougeguerrilla forces occupy parts of the gem-rich area near Pailin. ButPremier Hun Sen predicted that the rebels would be unable to holdtheir ground.   Cambodian officials and a Soviet military observer said the twosides were throwing their best divisions at each other in Pailin.They said the Khmer Rouge was raining up to 2,000 mortar shells aday on the town.   The battle has raised fears that Cambodia will slide into civilwar after Vietnam's soldiers are gone. Many Cambodians say they areworried the government army will be unable to stand up to the KhmerRouge.   Cambodians have begun stockpiling rice in some cities for fearthat guerrilla forces may cut supply lines, sending the price ofrice up at least 200 percent.   Ethnic Vietnamese, who fear persecution under the Khmer Rouge,also have reportedly begun fleeing back to Vietnam.   The Khmer Rouge seized power in 1975 from American-backed Gen.Lon Nol after a civil war. It ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1978 andkilled hundreds of thousands of people in practicing anultra-radical form of agrarian communism.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in December 1978 and ousted the KhmerRouge, replacing it with a government to its own liking.   Since then, the conflict has been stalemated.   China supplies the Khmer Rouge with weapons, and Thailand allowsthe guerrilla group to use its territory. The Soviet Union andVietnam supply Cambodia with arms. Peace talks failed in Paris lastmonth.   Earlier Monday, thousands of Vietnamese soldiers in personnelcarriers and tanks rolled past the Royal Palace in Phnom Penh asthe Vietnamese army made what it said was its last exit from thecapital.   School children were brought to the central square to bid theVietnamese invaders farewell.   Soldiers rolled by in American-made equipment captured from theUnited States during the Vietnam War. A long line of Dodge buses,``Saigon Express'' written on their sides, led the convoy.   Heng Samrin, president of the Vietnamese-installed government,thanked the commanders of two departing divisions and hailed ``therevolutionary friendship of the Cambodian and Vietnamese peoples.''</TEXT></DOC>
