(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A couple have been ordered to standtrial for murder for allegedly killing their baby daughter with acocaine overdose.   A Superior Court judge Tuesday overturned a lower-court decisionand ordered Gilbert and Debbie Delgado to stand trial for the 1986death of 2-month-old Stephanie Delgado. A municipal judge ruledthere was not enough evidence to charge the couple with murder.   The child's death, at first linked to sudden infant deathsyndrome, was later blamed on cocaine when tests found smallamounts in the child's system, authorities said.   ``We believe that the Delgados, by selling and using largeamounts of cocaine in a very tiny apartment and in very closeproximity to a 2-month-old child, were creating an inherentlydangerous environment,'' Deputy District Attorney Richard Kingsaid. ``It was just a matter of time before this child died ofcocaine.''   Superior Court Judge Jean Rheinheimer set a Jan. 23 trial date.</TEXT></DOC>
