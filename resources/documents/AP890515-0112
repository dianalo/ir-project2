The Chemical Workers Industrial Union, which represents about 80percent of Mobil's 1,500 black employees in South Africa, said nineinstallations in Johannesburg and other communities were affectedby the work stoppage.   Chris Bonner, a union official in Johannesburg, said she had notheard from shop stewards about whether the protest might continueTuesday. She also said she did not know what effect the stoppagehad on Mobil operations.   There was no immediate comment from Mobil.   The union plans to poll its members later this week to determineif they support a nationwide strike against Mobil because of itsrefusal to negotiate the terms of its disinvestment.   The company announced April 28 it was selling its holdings inSouth Afrivca to the General Union Mining Corp., a conglomerateknown as Gencor that owns a petroleum subsidiary.   Mobil said Gencor would not change employment practices andwould honor all existing arrangements with the union. But unionofficials nonetheless were angered, saying Mobil had rebuffed pastattempts to open negotiations by insisting there were no plans fordisinvestment.   The union had approached Mobil and several other foreigncompanies in South Africa, asking for 12-month advance notice ofany pullout, guarantees of job security amd full disclosure of theterms of sale.   Scores of U.S. companies have withdrawn from South Africa in thepast five years, citing economic considerations and pressure fromthe anti-apartheid movement.</TEXT></DOC>
