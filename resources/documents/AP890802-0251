Legal experts said Tuesday the guilty verdict on 63 of 64 countsin the Princeton-Newport tax fraud trial strengthens thegovernment's decision to use the controversial Racketeer Influencedand Corrupt Organizations law.   ``I think the verdict shows the statute can be used successfullyin this area,'' said Gerard Lynch, a criminal law professor atColumbia University. ``I would have expected it would be used moreanyway and this verdict encourages it.''   The U.S. District Court trial of five executives of the defunctinvestment firm Princeton-Newport Partners LP and a former DrexelBurnham Lambert Inc. trader was the first time the statute was usedin a securities case.   Opponents of the law say applies far too stiff penalties forwhite-collar criminals _ including a 20-year jail term per count.They also say its provision for pretrial asset seizures can forcecompanies out of business before a trial.   ``I think RICO as originally promulgated by Congress wasexcellent. I think it has become grossly overused and abused,''said securities lawyer Aubrey B. Harwell Jr., who represented aformer Drexel trader in another case stemming from the government'sthree-year crackdown on Wall Street crime.   Former Manhattan U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, now running forNew York City mayor, pioneered the new use of RICO _ and, criticssay, threats to use it.   Giuliani was accused of trying to pressure the Princeton-Newportdefendants to testify against others by charging them withracketeering. Princeton-Newport has said the charges last Augustforced its liquidation shortly thereafter.   Drexel Chief Executive Frederick H. Joseph has said his firmagreed in a separate case to pay $650 million and plead guilty tosix securities felonies rather than face a possible RICO indictment.   Michael Milken, the former head of Drexel's junk bondoperations, was indicted on 98 counts of racketeering and fraudearlier this year for transactions that included one also cited inthe Princeton-Newport complaint after refusing to enter a pleaagreement.   A person familiar with his legal preparations said Tuesday thePrinceton-Newport verdict would not affect Milken's plans to fightthe charges.   But legal experts said Monday's guilty verdict would giveprosecutors a psychological boost as they ready for Milken'sscheduled March 1990 trial. It also could spur more RICO securitiescases.   ``It certainly would indicate the Department of Justice theviability of RICO at least before a jury and in a case where taxseemed to be the overriding concern,'' said Columbia securities lawprofessor Harvey Goldschmid.   Justice Department guidelines on RICO state the law should notbe used as a substitute for tax fraud prosecutions. But theguidelines are flexible, and in the Princeton-Newport case taxclaims were brought instead as mail fraud charges.   New York attorney Martin Klein, a close friend of Milken's,argues that the statute should not be used simply to fit the needsof prosecutors.   ``It's not a substitute for the securities laws or the tax lawsand it's not to be used as a catchall for every other federalstatute,'' he said.   Nevertheless, proponents of the law say its broad nature and thechanging nature of crime, in which such frauds as insider tradinghave become more common, have made RICO a logical tool to fight anypattern of criminal activity.   ``If the RICO statute can be used for three bookmakers standingon the corner it certainly ought to be used for individuals sittingin corporate boardrooms stealing massive amounts of money from thepublic,'' said Ronald Goldstock, director of the New York StateOrganized Crime Task Force.   Congress is considering two bills that would revamp RICO's usein civil cases, eliminating its award of triple damages. SupremeCourt Chief Justice William Rehnquist in May called for imposinglimitations on civil use of RICO.   Others said RICO's severe potential penalties were inappropriatefor cases such as Princeton-Newport. The jury, lawyers said, mayhave convicted the defendants of arranging illegal tax schemes withor without the RICO charge.   ``My own view is that it's got to be an extremely aggravatedwhite-collar case to use the RICO statute,'' said criminal defenselawyer Robert Morvillo. ``I don't think it was originally designedfor this use. I think it's very heavy-handed.''</TEXT></DOC>
