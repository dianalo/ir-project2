The rules, being written by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's staff, would bar thrifts from counting direct equity investments toward meeting their required level of capital. They also would base each institution's capital requirement in part on its exposure to possible losses that could result from fluctuations in interest rates. The rules could require the riskiest thrifts to maintain capital of as much as 11% of their assets, three percentage points more than is required for commercial banks.    The rules would sharply curtail thrifts' equity investments in such things as real estate. Under the changed policy, the Bank Board, in effect, would say, &quot;Fine, go ahead and do it, but you're not risking insured deposits,&quot; said Jonathan Fiechter, a staff member for the Bank Board's Office of Regulatory Activities.    The draft is the thrift version of the risk-based capital requirements that the Federal Reserve Board has adopted for banks. The thrifts' response to it may make the controversy over the bank rules look tame, however.    The proposal &quot;will produce howls from some in the industry&quot; unless there are substantial exemptions, said Leonard Bickwit, a Washington attorney who has represented some savings industry clients.    In its current weakened condition, the thrift industry may have a difficult time meeting steep new capital requirements. &quot;Just because you articulate the standard doesn't mean the industry can meet it,&quot; said Thomas Vartanian, a former Bank Board general counsel. &quot;If it puts the goal beyond the industry's reach,&quot; he said, &quot;it isn't going to help.&quot;    Though an industry drive to water down the rule is expected, the Bank Board is under heavy political pressure to tighten thrift regulatory requirements, Mr. Vartanian noted. Congress's receptivity to thrift arguments is dropping, as the cost of dealing with insolvent thrifts mounts; many analysts predict that Congress will have to pick up part of the tab.    Mr. Fiechter said the goal in the draft regulations is to require that thrifts maintain capital totaling 8% of their assets, on average, the same standard that will be phased in for banks by 1992.    The capital requirements would have two tiers. The basic requirement to cover for bad credit risk would be 6% of assets. But assets would be weighted differently. Relatively safe assets such as home mortgages would have a 50% weight, so the capital requirement for them, in effect, would be 3%. Riskier commercial loans would have a 100% weight, so thrifts would have to maintain the full 6% capital against them.    On top of the base requirement, thrifts could be required to maintain additional capital depending on their risk of loss from interest rate fluctuations. The best-hedged thrifts would have to maintain almost no additional capital to meet this second tier requirement, but the most exposed ones could be required to maintain an additional 4% or 5%, Mr. Fiechter said, making their total requirement as high as 11%.    Though Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has talked about requiring added capital for banks with high exposure to interest rate fluctuations, the Fed's recently-promulgated capital rule doesn't do that.    The problem is more common to the thrift industry, however, which historically has used money from short-term deposits to pay for mortgages of 15 to 30 years. That approach exposes thrifts to massive losses if short-term rates shoot above historic long-term rates, as they did in the early 1980s.    With thrifts' growth already being curbed by regulators, Mr. Fiechter says, interest rate swings may be the industry's biggest source of vulnerability. Some analysts say that risk is growing with the expansion of thrift investments in mortgage-backed securities and their derivatives.    The Home Loan Bank of San Francisco has pressed the Bank Board to warn thrifts to curb their interest rate risk. The San Francisco regulators are urging thrifts to arrange their portfolios so that they would remain profitable even if rates jump two percentage points, and they would stay solvent for five years even if rates go up four percentage points. Early this year, a San Francisco home loan bank official estimated only a little more than half his district's thrifts could meet the test. &quot;The others,&quot; he said, &quot;we're working on.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
