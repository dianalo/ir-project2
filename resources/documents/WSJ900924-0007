Now New York isdemonstrating the same thing.   In Massachusetts, John Silber's surprise victory in theDemocratic primary has reinvigorated an intellectuallybankrupt party and given it a better chance to hold on to theGovernor's mansion after the Dukakis debacle. But Mr. Silber,the fiery president of Boston University, barely squeaked bythe anti-democratic rule that no one can run in a primary ifhe does not win 15% or more of the delegates at a stateconvention. Except for a public outcry over his possibleexclusion, party bosses probably would have succeeded inbarring Mr. Silber from the primary ballot.</LP><TEXT>   In the New York Republican Party, the bosses succeeded inhandpicking their candidate, and their party is now payingthe price. The party is in danger of permanent collapse, andthe man principally responsible is State Senator Roy Goodman,who picked Gubernatorial Candidate Pierre Rinfret by leafingthrough his address book. Mr. Goodman was looking for analternative, any alternative, to New York University DeanHerbert London, already the Conservative Party nominee. Mr.Goodman and other bosses wanted a less conservative and morepliable candidate.   As soon as Mr. Goodman rammed his choice through a partyconvention, it developed that Mr. Rinfret, an economist ofeccentric views, was not even a registered Republican. Mr.Rinfret was said to have promised to spend $600,000 of hisown money on the campaign, but it now develops he hasn't donethat either.   Indeed, Mr. Rinfret has done little but embarrassRepublicans. Last week, he denounced Jack Kemp as a &quot;traitor&quot;and a &quot;lackey for Governor Cuomo.&quot; He then threatened to &quot;gosailing&quot; until the election if the party didn't come up with$1 million. On Friday, he finally promised to stay in therace -- for now.   But Republicans have lost a golden opportunity tochallenge the Cuomo fiscal record, which more and moreresembles that of Michael Dukakis's Massachusetts. Worse, theRinfret disaster threatens to lower Republican voter turnoutto dangerously low levels. That could hand control of theState Senate to the Democrats, giving that party the power togerrymander New York into a one-party state. Senator Goodmanhimself could be swept away in a sudden Democratic tide.   There is still some hope for New York Republicans. Thestate election code allows the party to replace any candidatewho leaves the state for an extended period of time. If Mr.Rinfret were indeed to &quot;go sailing&quot; until the election, thenRepublicans could nominate the estimable Mr. London to lead aunited front against Mr. Cuomo. A Cuomo victory would stillbe likely, but a laughing-stock landslide wouldn't be.   The biggest challenges to effective democracy today arethe efforts of entrenched interests to stifle new ideas andpolitical competition. The Democratic reinvigoration inMassachusetts and the Republican collapse in New York bothsuggest that the cure for the alienation and apathy thatpollsters constantly find among voters is to bring back therough-and-tumble of real, competitive politics.   There are lessons here for both parties. The near debaclein Massachusetts came in the state headed by the nationalDemocrats' most recent standard-bearer, after all, andclearly even the rank and file of their own party is lookingfor something new. The Republican collapse comes in the statemost dominated by respectable, go-along, slice-of-bread,permanent-minority Republicans. There is still a lot of thatsentiment in Washington as well, and Republicans should lookwhere it leads.</TEXT></DOC>
