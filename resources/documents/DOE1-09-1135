The resourcesof natural gas are too small to make a significant contribution to ultimatecarbon emissions. The carbon emissions from the production and combustionof gas can be significant; in some of the cases analyzed for the project,50% of the carbon emissions are associated with gas. Increased use ofsynthetic gas does not increase carbon emissions unless the gas displaceselectricity produced from nuclear power or solar energy.</TEXT></DOC>
