The difference between Wednesday's reception and the past eightyears of the Reagan administration was like ``night and day,'' saidJay D. Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation and oneof the six leaders of environmental groups who spent 45 minutes overbreakfast with the president-elect.   ``I am an environmentalist,'' Bush proclaimed in the campaign.Among specifics, Bush has endorsed the goal of no net loss ofwetlands, has urged new acid rain controls if the government's $5billion, five-year ``clean coal'' demonstration programs provedisappointing and has said he plans to sponsor an internationalconference on global warming.   The few environmental groups endorsing candidates backed Bush'sopponent, Michael Dukakis, and some that made no formal endorsementstill attacked Bush for his leadership of the regulatory reform taskforce early in the Reagan administration.   But all that seemed forgotten in the warm glow surrounding acrowded post-breakfast news conference arranged by a coalition of 30environmental groups organized under the name ``Blueprint for theEnvironment.''   Bush said ``we would be rather surprised and really pleased withsome appointments he planned to make in the near future,'' accordingto Tina Hobson, executive director of Renew America, a groupconcentrating on energy efficiency. Bush also said he would arrangepre-confirmation meetings of his nominees with environmental leaders.   Hair said he told the vice president, ``Mr. Bush, read my lips:Protect the environment,'' and Bush reacted positively to thewordplay on his own no-taxes campaign phrase, replying, ``I will, Iwill.''   ``We will be on his team,'' said John Adams of the NaturalResources Defense Council.   Hair said the early 1980s were a time of ``ideologicalshrillness, anti-environmental actions and lack of stewardship'' inthe administration. Though Bush was the second-ranking member ofthat administration, Hair said, ``I didn't sense any of that thismorning.''   The ``greenhouse effect'' warms the Earth when gases, notablycarbon dioxide from burning fossil fuels, trap infra-red radiationthat normally would escape into space.   Most scientists agree that the earth has warmed by almost onedegree Fahrenheit over the past century, and the warming willaccelerate to another three to eight degrees sometime in the nextcentury. The major remaining uncertainty is over timing, with someestimates putting such a warming by 2030 and others in 2075 or later.   When it came to the greenhouse effect, Bush ``knew what we weretalking about,'' said Adams, who called it ``the single most seriousproblem facing the world,'' because of the massive shifts in croppatterns, weather and seacoast changes that could follow.   Though Bush gave no commitments on that or any issue, ``he wasconcerned and he was prepared to take action,'' said Adams.   The greenhouse effect is clearly the top priority of the group.The first four of 61 recommendations singled out as important enoughfor a separate listing all dealt with it in one way or another _promotion of an international agreement, ending use of chemicalsthat destroy the ozone layer, reforestation and aggressive energyconservation programs.   The environmentalists, who have spent a year drawing uprecommendations in 16 green books for distribution to affectedgovernment departments and agencies, also called for tax and feeincreases and other tax law changes that would increase governmentrevenues by $17.1 billion, spending cuts totaling $2.2 billion andspending increases aimed at benefiting the environment totaling $5.5billion.   The new taxes would include a 10-cent increase in the current9.2-cents-per-gallon gasoline tax to raise $10 billion.   The new spending would include $2 billion to improve mass transitand $325 million or 20 percent more for the Environmental ProtectionAgency, which the group said should be elevated to Cabinet status.   The recommendations encompass just about every federal actionenvironmentalists have sought in recent years, reveal someduplication and are bound to prove hard to carry out in someinstances.   Some of the proposals, such as the elimination of irrigationsubsidies and money-losing timber sales, have been rejected byCongress several times.   New opposition came quickly on Wednesday, from the U.S. Chamberof Commerce, which said in a statement from Harvey Alter, manager ofresources policy, that the recommendations were ``incomplete,alarmist, misleading and intellectually dishonest.''   ``The blueprint should be rewritten around a broad environmentalconsensus of goals, followed by an honest attempt to constructstrategies that will meet these goals in a timely and cost-effectivefashion,'' Alter said.</TEXT></DOC>
