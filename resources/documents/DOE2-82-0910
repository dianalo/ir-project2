Estimation and established abundance are 2 trillion tons and740 billion tons, respectively, of which 59% is in the Northern Chinaand 19% in the Northwest region. The primary energy consumption is 800million tons equivalent to coal, of which coal is about 80%. About 3/4of coal is consumed for production and construction, e.g., thermal powergeneration, coke production and railway transportation, with the remaining1/4 for household use. Use of coal gas is being promoted for householdconsumption from the viewpoint of efficiency and pollution control. Coalis used as fuel or raw material in the chemical industry, e.g., syntheticammonia, carbide acetylene and methanol. The National Planning Committeehas established a basic policy on coal and is promoting the developmentwith foreign funds and technology. Export is also encouraged. The productioncosts are 40-48 Yuan per ton in North China and 65-88 Yuan per ton inNortheast and Mid-China regions. The price of North China coal has strongcompeting power. The export is increasing and the target for 1990 is30 million tons. (53 figs, 74 tabs, 27 refs.)</TEXT></DOC>
