Nobody will evenlisten to it anymore.;    &quot;In the first two or three days, they listened. Theyran to the shelters. But now, the alarm sounds and they go on shopping in themarket. Now, they got used to it.&quot;;     More reports pour in;    Abu Kashef'saccount of life in war-torn Iraq is just one of more than a dozen recentreports from foreign doctors, journalists and several Iraqis. Together, theyhave described the human impact in recent days of the most massive, continuousair assault on a nation since the U.S. carpet bombing of North Vietnam twodecades ago.;    As the allied war to force Iraq from Kuwait neared thefour-week mark, the accounts continued to indicate Saturday that therelentless bombardments have claimed an increasing number of civilian livesthroughout Iraq.;    The pinpoint bombing runs also have demolished virtuallyevery Iraqi communications center, every power station and most oilrefineries, key bridges, military bases and airfields. The result, in effect,has been to push Iraq back a century.;     Developments so far;    Among theobservations to emerge:;    (check) Western journalists returning to Jordanfrom Iraq this weekend confirmed reports that key Iraqi government ministriesand some military commands have been relocated into schools and other civilianfacilities, while elite T-72 tank squadrons have taken cover in palm-treedoases near villages or main roads, increasing the likelihood of more civiliancasualties in the future.;    (check) Popular support for Iraqi PresidentSaddam Hussein is just beginning to show signs of fraying, particularly amongmiddle- and upper-class residents of Baghdad, where once-unheard-of graffiticondemning the unchallenged leader has begun to appear, and where even thewife of an Iraqi air force officer told of seeing an angry woman, screamingcondemnation of Saddam in the street.;    (check) For most of bomb-wearyBaghdad, though, the fear of their first few days and weeks under thebombardment has turned to a deep frustration and anger. The majority of Iraqisnow appear to blame the allies, more than Saddam, for a war that they believeno longer is aimed simply at driving Iraq from Kuwait, but at punishing Iraqfor growing too powerful militarily and economically in a region where Israelalone now predominates.;    (check) And, clearly, after watching every moderninstitution around them crushed by bombs, most Iraqis are increasinglyconvinced of what they dare not speak aloud -- that ultimately, Iraq willlose, not just Kuwait, but much of Iraq's recent strides toward modernization,as well.;    One of the most poignant interviews with an Iraqi, filmed byseveral Western television networks visiting Iraq for the past week andsmuggled out to Jordan, took place in Baghdad's Adhemeya district Thursday,the morning after several rockets destroyed a group of civilian houses.;    Understanding the bombs;    Hassan Bayaji, an articulate Iraqi in his mid-40swhose sister's home had just been destroyed, explained in perfect English thathe did not believe that the pilots who fired the rockets had deliberatelytargeted the houses. Rather, he reckoned, the aircraft were aiming for thenearby Adhemeya bridge, a key logistics span over Baghdad's Tigris River.;   After the missile attack the previous night, Bayaji said he had helped siftthrough the rubble for human casualties. &quot;They were shattered into pieces,&quot; hesaid. &quot;They were not whole corpses.&quot;;    He was asked whether the bombing runshave left Baghdad's nearly 4 million people frightened: &quot;You may say yes --but angrier, rather angry than frightened,&quot; he replied. &quot;When you are in theproblem -- in the crisis -- you are frightened. But when it's over, you arevery angry.&quot;;    Bayaji was then asked about the legendary steadfastness thatthe Iraqis developed and promoted as a national trait during their eight-yearwar with Iran, and whether this war is different from the last one.;    &quot;It isvery different,&quot; he said. &quot;We had the mastery of the air at the time, and oncein two or three months, an Iranian airplane came. And they used to hitmilitary installations -- not civilians. Then, they (the Iranians) startedhitting us with rockets. But only every 10 days, every 20 days, a rocket hit apart of Baghdad. So people got used to it.;    &quot;Now, it is somethingdifferent. They don't give you a chance to breathe. . . . And . . . we hearthat 10 people were killed in that quarter, or 14 over there. They are notsoldiers. They have nothing to do with the fighting. They are just theinhabitants of Baghdad.&quot;;    His conclusion: &quot;Now the target is the Iraqiprogress, the Iraqi government, the Iraqi regime. They are trying to get ridof our leader and our regime, and they want to pulverize Iraq and put an endto our economic growth. . . . It isn't the liberation of Kuwait. It'spunishing Iraqis.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK FINEMAN, Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Amman, Jordan  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910210  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,002  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday February 10, 199100041064,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
