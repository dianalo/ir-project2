A continuing surplus of internationally traded coal availableat low prices will maintain pressure on the industry, particularly ifprivately-owned electricity generation leads to the ending of the JointUnderstanding with the CEGB and complete freedom to import coal. Thenuclear power industry will also experience difficulty if transferredto the private sector, given the likely tendency of a privately-ownedESI to favour generation options with short construction lead times andpayback periods. The regulatory framework which is devised to overseethe new arrangements will determine whether the development of small-scalegeneration options, and the introduction of much greater demand managementand conservation, will become commercial possibilities for meeting capacityrequirements. (Britain may again become a net oil importer by the endof the present Government's term of office.) In the oil industry, therewill be concern to ensure that fields continue to be developed, particularlyif international oil prices fall below 18 US dollars/bbl for a protractedperiod. The country will become virtually self-sufficient in gas overthe next five years, but the Government may need to decide whether toallow another gas import contract to be signed. The need for gas importswill depend on the perceptions of future availability of domestic gassupplies, particularly from associated gas and condensate fields. Overthe next five years, energy policy is likely to be very heavily influencedby three areas which will seem much more important and politically sensitivethan energy: employment, the environment and the balance of payments.Any specific energy policy rationale has therefore become much less distinctwithin the general macroeconomic and political framework of decisionmaking. 80 refs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
