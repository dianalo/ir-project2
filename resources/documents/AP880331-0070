DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former Wedtech Corp. official has admittedthat he waited months before telling prosecutors about his allegedattempt to offer a $200,000 bribe to U.S. Attorney General EdwinMeese III.   Mario Moreno, former vice chairman of the defunt Bronx defensecontractor, says prosecutors didn't ask him about Meese and hedidn't volunteer the information.   A prosecutor, however, objected to defense attorney DominickAmorosa's line of questioning Wednesday at the racketeering trialof Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., and six others.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mary Shannon explained, with the juryout of the room, that prosecutors in Manhattan were barred frominquiring about Meese because he was then being investigated inWashington under the special prosecutor law.   Meese has not been charged with any wrongdoing, although aspecial prosecutor continues to investigate his dealings withWedtech, a local manufacturer that won millions of dollars indefense contracts.   The attorney general's legal troubles have placed him underincreasing pressure to step down, triggered in part by theresignation of some of his top aides earlier this week.   Ms. Shannon also said the special prosecutor initially wasinvestigating former White House aide Lyn Nofziger, not Meese,until last May. Nofziger was convicted last month of illegallobbying for Wedtech.   Biaggi, his eldest son, Richard, and the other co-defendants areaccused of turning Wedtech into a racketeering enterprise that paidbribes to public officials and others.   Moreno is one of four former Wedtech officers cooperating withthe government in a bid for leniency.   He has previously testified that he and former Wedtech PresidentAnthony Guariglia offered $200,000 to E. Robert Wallach, a closefriend of the attorney general, ``to fix the case'' with Meese.   He also said that Wallach never got back to them and the moneynever was paid.   In his 12th day on the witness stand, Moreno admitted underprodding by Amorosa, Richard Biaggi's attorney, that he did nottell prosecutors about the bribe offer until at least August 1987,more than eight months after he and the other ex-Wedtech officersbegan cooperating with investigators.   Wallach, former Meese financial adviser W. Franklyn Chinn, andanother man have been indicted in a separate case, charged withallegedly taking payoffs from Wedtech to influence Meese and othergovernment officials.   All three have pleaded innocent.</TEXT></DOC>
