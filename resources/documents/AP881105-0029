It was drafted by theNational LAN Laboratory in Reston, Va., and approved this week bymore than 60 companies:   1. All software should be purchased from known, reputable sources.   2. All purchased software should be in its original shrink wrapor sealed diskette containers when received.   3. Back-up copies of all original software should be made as soonas the software package is opened. Back-up copies should be storedoff-site.   4. All software should be reviewed carefully, by a systemmanager, before it is installed on a computer network.   6. New software should be quarantined on an isolated computer.This testing will greatly reduce the risk of system viruscontamination.   7. A back-up copy of all system software and data should be madeat least once a month, with the back-up copy stored for at least oneyear before re-use. This will allow restoration of a system that hasbeen contaminated by a ``time-released'' virus. A plan that includes``grandfathered'' rotation of back-up copies will reduce risk evenfurther.   8. System administrators should restrict access to systemprograms and data on a ``need-to-use'' basis. This isolatesproblems, protects critical applications, and aids problem diagnosis.   9. All programs on a system should be checked regularly forprogram length changes. Any program-length deviations could beevidence of tampering, or virus infiltration.   10. Many shared or free programs are invaluable. However, theseare the prime entry point for viruses. Skeptical review of suchprograms is prudent. Also, extended quarantine is essential beforethese programs are introduced to a computer system.   11. Any software that exhibits symptoms of possible viruscontamination should be removed immediately. System managers shoulddevelop plans for quick removal of all copies of a suspect program,and immediate backup of all related data. These plans should be madeknown to all users, and tested and reviewed periodically.</TEXT></DOC>
