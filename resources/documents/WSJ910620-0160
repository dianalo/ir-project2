Though spring migration was at its height, wewere not heading for budding groves of Central Park's Ramble,where warblers, thrushes, tanagers and other songbirds ofpassage are known to drop in on their way to northernbreeding grounds.   No, we were heading for the treeless canyons of downtownand midtown Manhattan. We were looking for birds that hadcollided with skyscrapers. Dead birds.</LP><TEXT>   Our pre-dawn outing had been organized by Sarah Elliott, aformer children's book editor who now leads bird walks forthe Central Park Conservancy. Ms. Elliott believes thatilluminated tall buildings, &quot;well-lit phallic symbols,&quot; inher words, are deathtraps for passing migratory birds. And soin the latest issue of the Urban Audubon, a monthlynewsletter of the New York City Audubon Society, she haslaunched the Captains for Conservation program. Its purpose:to inspire &quot;Captains of Industry&quot; who own or run brightlyilluminated skyscrapers to turn off their lights during themigration seasons. This will save birds. It will saveelectricity costs as well and bring companies good publicity.Ms. Elliott also threatens: &quot;Soon holdouts with flashyfloodlights will look like slobs to the public and theirpeers.&quot; But she needs evidence -- hence our expedition.   Richard C. Banks, an ornithologist for the U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, does not consider skyscrapers to be aserious threat to birds. &quot;It's more of an emotional thingthan a scientific problem,&quot; he says, &quot;connected with people'sconcern about the individual bird. As an avian biologist Itend to worry more about populations, and from that viewpointthe numbers killed by crashing into tall structures are notsignificant.&quot;   An expert on bird collisions with man-made structuresdisagrees. Ornithologist Robert Crawford accumulated vastquantities of data about bird migration by picking up deadbirds daily at the base of a huge TV tower in Leon County,Fla., as part of a 25-year research project. If the numbersof transmitters and other tall structures throughout thecountry are added up, Mr. Crawford believes, the cumulativeeffect on birds is &quot;far from trivial.&quot; He estimates that morethan one million birds die annually in collisions with TVtowers alone.   Mr. Crawford believes that bad weather and brightillumination can be a deadly combination for migratory birds.Normally, they zip along at altitudes well above the highesttower or skyscraper. But they are forced to fly lower whenthe skies are overcast. Then rain, mist or fog combine withlights to disorient and bewilder birds, causing them tocrash. Why, then aren't our city streets littered with deadbirds on rainy days in the spring and fall? Mr. Crawford hasan answer based on his study: Long before dawn, predatorsmake off with 80% of the downed birds.   That is why we are here at the plaza of the World TradeCenter at this mind-numbing hour. We want to beat thesweepers who might whisk away the unsightly little corpses,or the rats who might make a tasty meal of them beforeanybody arrives.   Our fact-finding mission sets to work. We search the basesof all buildings, we look in crevices, nooks and crannies.Starr Saphir, a board member of the New York City AudubonSociety who also leads bird-identifying walks duringmigration seasons, suddenly stops and listens. &quot;Over there] Ihear a white-throated sparrow.&quot; Sure enough, a small birdwith black-and-white head stripes and a yellow spot above thebill appears. It is scratching around near a planter. It is,however, a living bird.   A subsequent telephone call to Gus Preschle, the generalmanager of the World Trade Center, helped to explain theabsence of avian cadavers at New York's tallest skyscrapercomplex. &quot;Unlike many other tall buildings,&quot; Mr. Preschlesaid with a certain smugness, &quot;we have no decorative lightingon the towers themselves. There are no floodlights on thebuilding.&quot;   The Empire State Building is a different story. Everybodyknows that this famous skyscraper is lavishly illuminatedwith bright lights and colors. And indeed, birds collidingwith the building have made headlines for almost half acentury. &quot;Fog Is Blamed as Birds Die Hitting Empire StateBuilding. Tiny Bodies Litter 5th Avenue,&quot; a front-pageheadline proclaimed on September 12, 1948. At least eightother large bird kills at the Empire State have been reportedover the years.   Actually, the powers that be at the Empire State Buildingare not unconcerned about bird welfare. &quot;We try to avoid anyreal trauma to the flock,&quot; says Charles Giuno, head ofoperations. &quot;On nights when the atmospheric conditions wouldcause them confusion, we turn off the floodlights and thevertical and horizontal fluorescent lights. The decision ismade on a day-to-day basis. If the guard at the observatorysees any birds flying around the lights, he is instructed tonotify the engineer. The engineer then turns off the lights.&quot;   This information does not mollify Ms. Elliott. She happensto live just three blocks east, and she says she has observedthe tower lights on even in bad weather. This is why ourgroup now makes its way to 33rd Street and Park Avenue. Sincethe small migrants would likely be coming from the South, wewould find any dead birds on the south side of the greatskyscraper.   It is almost 6 a.m. by now. We do not find any dead birds.But we do encounter a porter sweeping directly across thestreet. Angel Roman is his name and he has worked at 10 West33rd St. for 11 years. A couple of years ago, around midnighton a foggy night, he looked up and saw an amazing sight:&quot;Thousands of birds. Just going round and round and round inthe lights on top of the Empire State Building,&quot; he related.The next morning, he said, he found many dead birds on thesidewalk, and a few that were lying there, stunned but alive.   &quot;Aha]&quot; said Ms. Elliott triumphantly.   Our last inspection site was the Metropolitan LifeInsurance Building, a tall landmark on 23rd Street andMadison that is &quot;lit up like a birthday cake,&quot; as Ms. Elliottdescribed it. &quot;It is to lights what boom boxes are to music,&quot;she added. Across the street from our target building isMadison Square Park, a small, leafy oasis. &quot;A wave ofwarblers may have arrived last night,&quot; said Ms. Saphir. &quot;Ihear an oven bird and a black-throated blue.&quot;   It was almost daybreak as we approached the entrance ofthe Met Life building. And there we saw it, a soft, velvetybird about five inches long with a rich yellow throat and adramatic black mask across its eyes. It was lying motionlesson the sidewalk: a male common yellowthroat, a warbler moreat home in moist thickets and low underbrush than on a citypavement, a bird whose piercing song (&quot;witchety, witchety,witchety]&quot;) is one of the loudest in the warbler kingdom.&quot;Poor bird,&quot; said Ms. Elliott in a low voice as she stoopedto inspect it. At that moment the bird flew off, somewhatshakily, across the street into the park.   Our emotion: relief. Our tally: no dead birds, one dazedsurvivor. But the fact-finding committee had found a fact andMs. Elliott was gratified. &quot;We do know that bright lights putbirds at risk, and that's enough. People can destroy, butthey can't replace what they destroy. If birds go, all goes.&quot;   Note: If you are a Captain of Industry and wish to becomea Captain for Conservation, you may write Sarah Elliott at333 East 34 St., New York, N.Y. 10016.   ---   Ms. Winn watches birds in New York's Riverside Park.</TEXT></DOC>
