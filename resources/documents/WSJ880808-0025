Sease </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK NDX </IN><TEXT>   Don't get upset, but a Georgia Institute of Technology computer model says stock prices are ripe for another crash.    Fred C. Allvine, director of the stock market project at Georgia Tech's School of Management, says the project's computer model is now showing that the economic environment for stocks is actually worse than it was late last August, when stock prices began the long slide that ended in the Oct. 19 crash.    &quot;The bright yellow caution light has turned red and we believe conditions are set for the possibility of a major deterioration of the market over the next few weeks,&quot; Prof. Allvine warns.    The factors contributing to the decline in the Georgia Tech model, he says, are an economy that is overheated, unemployment recently at the lowest level in 14 years, inflation running at a 4.7% rate and productive capacity pushing its upper limits.    &quot;Conditions are the worst we've seen since the crash,&quot; he says. &quot;If we have continued deterioration of this environment, then the market is bound to head south.&quot;    The Georgia Tech model, which takes account of economic rather than internal stock market factors, tracks both long-term and short-term interest rates as well as money supply conditions. The model showed that since the crash, conditions for the stock market peaked in February and March before beginning their slide to the current levels.    That all sounds grim. But other market experts aren't particularly worried about the Georgia Tech computer's outlook. They argue that computer models, while useful forecasting tools, simply aren't good enough to be left to their own devices.    &quot;We all have our models or our numbers that we constantly plug into our forecasts,&quot; says A.C. Moore, director of research at Argus Research. &quot;But any model that isn't somewhat flexible may not be able to anticipate the changing dynamics of the market.&quot;    Mr. Moore wonders, for instance, how a computer model could be programmed to take into account the rapid globalization of financial markets that has made Japanese investors an increasingly important factor in U.S. financial markets.    In any case, he isn't worried that the market is about to crash. &quot;We don't feel like we're sitting on the edge of a precipice,&quot; he says. &quot;There's a lot of liquidity that, coupled with a low stock-bond yield gap, makes us feel that stocks are probably headed higher rather than lower.&quot;    Eugene Peroni, a technical analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, shuns computer models. &quot;Our approach has always been to study the tape, watch the stocks and log their movements by hand so you have a constant feel for the stocks,&quot; he says. &quot;That's the purist methodology and it hasn't been bettered yet.&quot;    Mr. Peroni does agree with Prof. Allvine's model that stock prices are ripe to fall, but he doesn't think it will be in any abrupt move. &quot;We could hit 1980 to 2010 on the Dow Jones industrials in the next three to five weeks, but it will be more of a series of incremental trading range retreats rather than a crashing drop.&quot;    And Eric Miller, chief market strategist for Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette, says he's skeptical of computer programs, too. &quot;There's also data or variables that resemble an earlier period, but there are always differences, too,&quot; he says. &quot;After that, it comes down to whether you are correctly weighting the variables. We shouldn't disregard some of the probabilities that models may indicate, but history never repeats itself exactly.&quot;    The current situation bears that out, Mr. Miller says. &quot;It's clear that a lot of monetary data have been sending out warning signals to the stock market,&quot; he says. &quot;But I don't think the likelihood of a crash in the very near term is very high. There's a lot of cash available, equity ratios are lower and programs aren't playing as much of a role now as they were before the crash.&quot;    ---   Friday's Market Activity   Stock prices slipped lower in the second-lightest trading day of the year.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 7.47 points to 2119.13. For the week the average was down 9.60 points.    Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled only 113.4 million shares, the lightest trading after the 102.6 million shares that changed hands July 23. Declining issues on the Big Board Friday were ahead of gainers, 846-566.    Among the blue-chip stocks, American Express slid 3/4 to 28 7/8, Chevron was off 1/2 to 47, Eastman Kodak dropped 1/4 to 44 1/2, International Business Machines lost 3/8 to 123 7/8, and USX fell 1/4 to 30 3/8.    Blue chips posting gains included United Technologies, up 5/8 to 38 1/4, McDonald's, up 1/8 to 45 1/8; and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, up 1/4 to 26 1/2.    Sharp gains in the dollar dealt a severe blow to Japanese stocks traded in the U.S. as American depositary receipts. Honda Motor lost 6 to 165 3/8, Matsushita was off 6 to 212 1/2, Hitachi fell 140 to 4 1/4, and TDK was down 3 1/4 to 76.    The most active stocks included Niagara Mohawk, off 1/8 to 13 1/2; Duke Power, up 1/8 to 45 5/8; General Motors, up 1/8 to 78 1/8; and Syntex, down 1 3/8 to 37 7/8. The first three were involved in dividend capture trades, market observers said, and Syntex was hit by concerns about stiff competition from a new Ciba-Geigy arthritis drug. </TEXT></DOC>
