The second-term Kansas senator dismisses talk of herself as arunning mate for George Bush in the fall campaign, saying shedoesn't think she offers the proper balance _ ``in personality'' _that Bush will want on the ticket.   But it is her strengths, cultivated over nearly a decade in theSenate, that apparently have brought the diminutive former Wichitahousewife and businesswoman to the attention of Bush's advisers.   On issues she chooses to dig into _ including foreign policy,national defense, the budget, transportation and agriculture _Kassebaum spends long hours marshaling facts and mulling overarguments before taking a position. Once taken, those positions areunshakable, as the Reagan administration has occasionally come tolearn.   Testifying this past spring before the GOP platform committee inKansas City, Mo., she spoke out firmly for the need to consider taxincreases as a weapon, along with spending cuts, in the fightagainst the federal deficit. That puts her potentially at odds withBush, who has vowed never to raise personal income taxes.   ``There is no way that we can cut $150 billion to $200 billionout of the federal budget,'' she stated, with unusual bluntness.``To promise to do so is to engage in fantasy.''   Despite such principled stands, Kassebaum has few politicalenemies. She has an unassuming personal charm and an explosivesmile that disarm opponents. And she eschews political gamesmanshipand gimmicks designed to gain publicity, a determination which hasgained her respect among colleagues while keeping her out of thelimelight.   Bush strategists may see in Kassebaum a way of offsetting apotential weakness for their candidate, what some pollsters havereferred to as Bush's ``gender gap.'' Kassebaum comes in for almostautomatic consideration as the only Republican woman in the Senateand one of a handful of GOP women with national standing.   While sympathetic to so-called women's issues _ Kassebaumsupports women's right to have an abortion and was a proponent ofthe Equal Rights Amendment _ she is uncomfortable leading thecharge on those matters.   Weighing against her selection as the vice presidentialcandidate are the small size of her home state _ Kansas has justseven electoral votes _ and a lack of identification beyond thestate's borders. Political observers doubt Kassebaum could bring tothe ticket a Midwest regional appeal based on farm and ruralinterests in the same way her Kansas colleague, Senate MinorityLeader Bob Dole, did as Gerald Ford's running mate in 1976.   Another potential minus is her soft-spoken, undynamic style, adrawback she has conceded. Seldom a participant in Senate floordebates, she prefers to play to her strength, one-on-one dealingswith colleagues.   The idea of Kassebaum on the short list for the No. 2 spot istaken seriously enough by the Republican right wing that it wasblasted as ``high-stakes skirt chasing'' in the conservativeweekly, Human Events.   The article attacked her pro-choice stand on abortion and warnedthat she would alienate the party's conservative wing, whichalready has doubts about Bush's claim to the Reagan legacy.Kassebaum's lifetime 52 percent rating from the AmericanConservative Union puts her in the bottom one-fourth of GOPsenators, it noted.   During a spring visit to California to campaign for there-election of Sen. Pete Wilson, Kassebaum was greeted byBush-Kassebaum bumper stickers. While flattered, she later brushedthe gesture aside.   ``There is a bumper sticker in Washington somewhere that says,`Honk if George Bush has asked you to be vice president,''' shesaid.   ``I don't anticipate it being offered to me. I don't think it'sthe right balance, and I think I tend to have pretty good politicalinstincts.''</TEXT></DOC>
