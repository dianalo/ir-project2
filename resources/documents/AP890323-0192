A statement released Thursday by the Argentine Embassy said thatfive Argentine naval ships that had been participating incontamination control work were being withdrawn ``due to glacier andmeteorological conditions.''   The statement said that oil spilled from the Argentine supplyship Bahia Paraiso has been removed from the sea surface and thatall ``potential pollutants'' have been removed from the wrecked ship.   American experts, however, say about 50,000 gallons of fuel oilare still aboard the Bahia Paraiso and National Science Foundationspokesman Jack Talmadge said that ``there has never been ship withoil in it that withstood an Antarctica winter.''   ``We're concerned about what might happen over the winter,'' hesaid.   The Bahia Paraiso lodged on rocks on DeLaca Island near thePalmer station and dumped about 170,000 gallons of diesel and jetfuel into the pristine waters nearby. An American research campcalled Palmer Station is 1.1 miles away.   Experts from the United States and Argentina stopped furtherleaks from the vessel and cleaned up much of the oil, but theArgentine navy now is leaving the scene while tons of fuel remain inthe Bahia Paraiso tanks.   Talmadge said the vessel could quite likely be susceptible toshifting by the force of ice and tide through the winter.   The approaching Antarctic winter will not halt American efforts,Talmadge said, because the NSF icebreaker Polar Duke is able tooperate out of Palmer Station in virtually all seasons.   The Argentine statement also claimed that ``no visible harm tothe local ecosystem was noticed, especially with respect to itsfauna.''   But experts at the National Science Foundation, which operatesthe U.S. research program in the region, said that the spill of fueloil from the Bahia Paraiso did cause some loss of wildlife in thearea near Palmer Station, and that the eventual impact of the spillmay not be known for years.   An extra team of American scientists went to Palmer Stationearlier this month to conduct new studies on the effects of the fueloil spill. They are expected to return in April.   NSF scientists have been monitoring the effects of the spillsince the ship first went aground and have reported:   _Among a population of 30,000 birds of at least eight species,fewer than 30 are known to have died directly as a result ofingesting the fuel oil. However, there is indirect evidence of otherlosses.   _Penguins returning to the sea after nesting were forced to swimthrough oil-covered water. Some penguins now are apparently beingeaten at sea by giant petrels, a long-winged bird. ``This diet,unusual for petrels, is evidence that the oil spill affectedpenguins,'' an NSF statement says.   _An entire generation of South Polar skuas died in one rookerynear Palmer Station. The skua is a gull-like bird of prey. NSFexperts said skua parents were apparently affected by the oil spilland failed to protect their nestlings from other skuas and otherpredatory birds. There are, however, many skua rookeries in theSouth Polar region.   _The loss most feared by scientists is that the area aroundPalmer Station, which has been a science outpost for 20 years, mayno longer be suitable for study because of distortions caused by theoil spill. ``The usefulness of ... Palmer Station for basic research(of) the undisturbed Antarctic ecosystem is in question,'' an NSFstatement said.</TEXT></DOC>
