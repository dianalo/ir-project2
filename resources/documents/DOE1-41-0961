RF capacitive heating is effective in inducing hyperthermictemperatures inside the body. The main drawback of this method is thehigh RF impedance of fat tissues at RF frequencies, resulting in s.c.fat heating. The absence of an appropriate RF technology to overcomethis obstacle, limited the use of this technique to superficial and accessibletumors. An improved RF capacitive technology at 13.56 MHz (HTM-3000,MME Israel) enables to heat at depth at therapeutic temperatures, withsimultaneous efficient cooling of s.c. fat and underlying tissues. Theexperimental and clinical results reported with the HTM-3000 RF capacitiveheating system demonstrate that RF capacitive heating is a potentialtool for the treatment of deep seated tumors, that deep heating is safelyfeasible. The currently reported advanced RF capacitive technology haveproven its ability of deep heating with simultaneous s.c. fat and underlyingtissues cooling.</TEXT></DOC>
