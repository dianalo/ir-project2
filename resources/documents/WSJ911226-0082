This recession has been widely characterized as mild,largely because the unemployment rate has held at 7% or less.It was 6.8% in November, and has averaged 6.7% this year. Bycontrast, the jobless rate averaged 9.7% in 1982 and 9.6% in1983. Also, monthly unemployment this year has averaged 8.4million, well below the average jobless total of 10.7 millionin 1982 and 1983.</LP><TEXT>   But these comparisons mask the breadth of the currentslump. This recession is close to matching the earlierdecline in numbers of people who have been jobless at sometime during the year and of those who have lost a job morethan once during the year. And it is outstripping earlierrecessions in its extensive reach -- lowering employment forpart-time and other &quot;contingent&quot; workers, who are morenumerous these days; covering more of the nationgeographically; affecting service industries more harshly;and causing layoffs for many more white-collar workers thanprevious recessions.   And the situation could even get worse; typically,unemployment stays high for a year or more after an economicrecovery begins.   Audrey Freedman, a labor economist at the ConferenceBoard, a business-backed research group, estimates that over25 million people, or fully 20% of the work force, will havebeen jobless at some time this year, up from 19.8 millionreported by the department's Bureau of Labor Statistics in1990 and 17.1 million in 1988. That wouldn't be far from the26.5 million total -- 22% of the work force -- who were outof a job at some time in recession year 1982.   &quot;The fact that unemployment is so diffused through thepopulation is having a political effect,&quot; Ms. Freedman says.&quot;There are 25 million disappointed, annoyed people, and theirpropensity to vote is probably very high,&quot; she says.   The psychological effect on all those unemployed people,their families and their friends is also widespread. Nearly10% of American families -- six million in all -- had atleast one unemployed member in the third quarter of thisyear, up from five million families a year earlier, the BLSsaid.   The Conference Board's personnel advisory group looks fora decline in the jobless rate in 1992 to 6.5% from 6.8%. Evenso, Ms. Freedman's &quot;hopeful&quot; estimate is that more than 21million people still will feel unemployment's sting duringthe year.   Meantime, a hefty portion of today's jobless consists ofpeople laid off more than once, and in the currentfast-changing job market the number of these people isclimbing. In 1990, BLS figures show, 5.8 million persons hadtwo or more spells of unemployment, up from 5.1 million in1989. Over half the total suffered three spells or more ofjoblessness. The 1991 figures are expected to besubstantially higher. In 1982, 7.6 million people were out ofwork more than once.   Many multiple job losers are in the construction, garmentor auto industries, where workers frequently move into andout of jobs. Others are temporary workers, whose jobs comeand go, by definition.   But in these days of fragile employment, there are manypeople like Patricia Lipski, a 35-year-old Philadelphiawoman. Laid off in April 1990 when her employer went out ofbusiness, she has lost jobs three times this year. InJanuary, she gave up a small partnership that was trying,with little success, to sell visual-aid products. In May, shegot a job answering phones for a paper company, but it lastedonly a week. She got a job as a receptionist and computeroperator for a heating and air conditioning company in July,but was told three weeks ago it wasn't working out. Thefirm's owner had died, and the new owner's daughter, whosehusband had just been laid off, was hired for thereceptionist position.   Ms. Lipski, who was evicted from her apartment in Octoberand is living with a friend, helps support a 10-year-old son.She was divorced in 1980, after both she and her husband losttheir jobs. Now, &quot;I'm just trying to keep my mentalstability,&quot; she says.   Also masking the extent of joblessness is the fact thatabout six million Americans are part-timers by choice ornecessity. Because they work some -- often as little as a fewhours a week -- they are counted as employed. But manyactually may be severely underemployed. In addition, morethan a million people aren't counted as unemployed becausethey are &quot;discouraged,&quot; no longer looking for work.   In today's more service-oriented economy, employers relyincreasingly on leased, temporary, part-time and other&quot;contingent&quot; workers and managers. Indeed, the increasingrole of women in the work force may accentuate this trend,because they often either want or are forced to take suchjobs. &quot;Many of these jobs are here today and gone tomorrow,&quot;says Richard Belous, a National Planning Associationeconomist.   As a result of this trend, more people feel the effect ofa business slump, the Conference Board's Ms. Freedman says.&quot;Transiency is penetrating even into the heart ofemployment,&quot; she notes. &quot;Nothing is stable anymore.&quot;   Robin Adler, 25 years old, worked for six months this yearas a TV station trainee and was then released. She has formeda support group called the &quot; `Un'Club,&quot; for similarly joblesspersons in the New York area, where the unemployment ratetops 10%. Sessions let participants &quot;discuss the difficultiesof breaking into the job market {again and again},&quot; amongother things, the group's news release says.   Finally, the effects of the current recession are morewidespread because it is affecting services more harshly thanin the past. Previous recessions, in contrast, were moreconcentrated among manufacturing industries that tended to beconcentrated geographically.   The percentage of industries in which employment shrankreached 63% in February of this year, almost as high as thepeaks of 64% of industries that contracted in December 1981and October 1982, during the last recession. Shrinkingindustries narrowed to 45% by August of this year, but haverisen again to 56% last month.   Moreover, this recession is affecting a wider range ofworkers. The BLS says that while the total number ofwhite-collar workers actually climbed sharply in 16-monthrecessionary periods in 1973-1975 and 1981-1982, they wereoff by over 200,000, to 67 million, in the 16 months betweenJuly 1990 and November of this year.   Similarly, blue-collar unemployment totals roseconsiderably more than white-collar joblessness during pastrecessions. But since July 1990, white-collar unemploymenthas increased about 680,000, to 2.9 million, whileblue-collar unemployment has risen about 635,000, to threemillion.   A greater awareness of the pinch of unemployment amongwhite-collar workers helps give it a pervasive nature thistime. For a manager who was drawing a salary of, say,$50,000, trying to maintain his usual standard of living onperhaps a $260 weekly unemployment check can be tough.   &quot;It's nothing like their former pay,&quot; says WilliamCunningham, an AFL-CIO official.</TEXT></DOC>
