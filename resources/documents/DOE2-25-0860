<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-0860 </DOCNO><TEXT>The US Department of Energy (DOE) is currently revising its low-levelradioactive waste (LLW) management requirements and guidelines for wastegenerated at its facilities that support defense missions. The draftDOE policy calls for DOE LLW operations to be managed to protect thehealth and safety of the public, preserve the environment, and ensurethat no remedial action will be necessary after termination of operations.The requirements and guidelines apply to radioactive wastes but are alsointended to apply to mixed hazardous and radioactive wastes. The basicapproach used by DOE is to establish overall performance objectives interms of ground-water protection and public radiation dose limits andto require site-specific performance assessments to determine compliance.As a result of these performance assessments to determine compliance.As a result of these performance assessments, each site shall developwaste acceptance criteria that define the allowable quantities and concentrationsof specific radioisotopes. Additional limitations on waste disposal design,waste form, and waste treatment shall also be developed on a site-specificbasis. As a key step in the site-specific performance assessments, anevaluation must be conducted of potential radiation doses to intruderswho may inadvertently move onto a closed DOE LLW disposal site afterloss of institutional controls must be conducted. This paper describesthe types of intruder scenarios that should be considered when performingthis step of the site-specific performance assessment. 9 refs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
