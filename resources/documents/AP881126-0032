Among the demonstrators was Amanda Blake of``Gunsmoke'' TV series fame.   In New York City, television game show host Bob Barker led about2,000 demonstrators chanting, ``Fur is murder! Don't buy fur!'' asthey marched down Fifth Avenue.   About 40 people picketed outside Saks Fifth Avenue andNeiman-Marcus department stores in Beverly Hills; 25 eachdemonstrated at a Boston fur store and a shopping center inHarrisburg, Pa.   In New York, some protesters occasionally spat on fur-cladpassers-by.   Barker said a woman admonished him, ``Shame on you, one of yourpeople spit on me.''   ``I said, `Only one?''' Barker said.   Dozens of shoppers stopped along the sidewalk to stare and point.One couple, sporting his and her furs, beat a hasty retreat acrossthe street.   ``My fur is beautiful. Please don't kill me or my friends,'' reada sandwich sign worn by a Labrador retriever.   Racoon pelts dangled from one man's outstretched fists; anothercarried a realistic-looking human skeleton. One woman trudged alongin a beaver costume and another wore bunny ears.   Barker, who quit his job as host of the Miss USA and MissUniverse beauty contests last year to protest the awarding of furcoats as prizes, said the demonstration had been ``successful beyondour wildest expectations.''   San Francisco organizers estimated they received 30 to 50 furs ina ``fur drop'' intended to get the items out of circulation.Organizers said the collected furs would be defaced and used foreducational purposes.   Demonstrators wore paper masks and carried signs as they marchedaround San Francisco's elegant Union Square shopping area. Somecarried traps while others dressed up as a reindeer, a panda bearand a fox.   Blake, best known for her role as Miss Kitty in ``Gunsmoke,''wore a fake-fur trimmed hat.   Explaining her decision 25 years ago to stop wearing real fur,she said, ``It's agony for the animals and I don't believe thatanimals should have to suffer for some dumb broad's vanity _ or forsome stupid man's vanity.''   Blake defended the leather boots she was wearing, sayingproducers ``use the whole cow ... That's important. It's not a trashanimal.''   Protesters objected to the conditions in which animals raised forfur are kept, alleging they are kept in isolation in cramped,wire-bottomed cages. They also object to the ways animals are killedto protect their pelts, which they said included trapping, gassing,suffocation and electrocution.   Belkin's Furs owner Alan Belkin, whose business is one block awayfrom Union Square, rejected protesters' claims.   ``All the furs we use today are raised; they're not wild,'' hesaid.   Animals are raised well in clean environments partly becausemistreatment would make their pelts valueless, he added, callinganimal rights activists extremists who will not be satisfied untilfurs are not used at all.   Among those handing over their furs in San Francisco were PaloAlto Humane Society President Patricia Elson and her daughter, Kate,who turned in two coats.   ``I'm ashamed to wear it,'' said Elson, holding a brown nutriacoat she valued at something under $1,000. ``I'm ashamed to have itin my closet. Every time I see it in my closet, I feel sick ... Yourealize you can't wear them for fashion anymore.''</TEXT></DOC>
