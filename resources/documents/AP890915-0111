It may be overruled.''   In the 1973 case, the court said government could not interferein the rights of a woman to an abortion during the first threemonths of pregnancy. It said states could regulate abortions duringthe second trimester only to protect a woman's health, and may takesteps to protect the life of the fetus in the third trimester ofpregnancy.   In a Missouri case decided by the court July 3, the court gavestates broader powers to regulate abortions, but Blackmun said hewas ``surprised'' the high court did not overturn Roe vs. Wade.   Three other abortion-related cases are due to be decided by thecourt in the coming term, which begins next month.   Blackmun dissented from the Missouri decision and denounced itfrom the bench, saying the court had silently invited furtherchallenges that would lead to overturning his 1973 ruling.   He told students at the northwestern Iowa school he didn't wantto comment further because of the three additional cases on abortionpending before the court.   ``I don't know what will happen, but it (Roe vs. Wade) may beoverturned,'' he said.   Blackmun, appointed to the court by President Nixon in 1970, didnot discuss abortion during his wide-ranging talk on constitutionalfreedoms. His remarks on the topic came in response to a question.</TEXT></DOC>
