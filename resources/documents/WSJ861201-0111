Centerior, a utility holding concern that owns Cleveland Electric Illuminating Co. and Toledo Edison Co., had planned the offering for early October. Centerior said the offering was originally postponed because the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had been expected to decide soon whether to issue an order, at the request of an intervenor, to require the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to reconsider the seismic design of the Perry nuclear plant near Cleveland after an earthquake occurred near the plant last January.    Last October, the court dismissed the request, saying it had been made prematurely because the NRC hadn't issued a full power license.    The NRC issued a full power license for Perry on Nov. 13. However, pending resolution of certain court appeals, the NRC ordered Cleveland Electric not to operate Perry Unit 1 above 5% of capacity while the court considers these petitions.    Centerior, which has 127 million common shares outstanding, said that getting the license to operate Perry removed the biggest hurdle to proceeding with the offering.    Centerior owns 51% of the Perry Plant. The plant is 35%-owned by Ohio Edison Co. and its Pennsylvania Power Co. unit and 14% by Duquesne Light Co. </TEXT></DOC>
