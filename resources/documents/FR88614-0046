The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredtobacco plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand also will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment.

The rule regulatesthe introduction (importation, interstate movement, and release into theenvironment) of genetically engineered organisms and products which areplant pests or which there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulatedarticles). The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for therelease into the environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limitedpermits for the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article.A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can be introducedin the United States.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).The Sandoz Crop Protection Corporation of Des Plaines, Illinois, has submittedan application for a permit for release into the environment of geneticallyengineered tobacco plants that are designed to be resistant to lepidopteraninsects. In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessedthe impact to the environment of releasing the tobacco plants under theconditions described in the Sandoz application. APHIS concluded that thefield testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand will also not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by the Sandoz Crop Protection Corporation, aswell as a review of other relevant literature, provides the public withdocumentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impactsassociated with conducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment. 1. A gene for insect resistance has been inserted into the tobacco chromosome.In nature, chromosomal genetic material can only be transferred to othersexually compatible plants by cross-pollination. In this field test, theintroduced gene cannot spread to other plants by cross-pollination becausethe field test plot is located at a sufficient distance from any sexuallycompatible plants with which the experimental tobacco plants could cross-pollinate.2. Neither the insect resistant gene itself, nor its gene product conferson tobacco any plant pest characteristics. 3. The microorganism from which the insect resistant gene was isolatedis not a plant pest and is widely distributed in the environment as a soilinhabitant.4. The vector used to transfer the insect resistance gene to tobacco plantshas been evaluated for its use in this specific experiment and does notpose a plant pest risk in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom a DNA sequence with known plant pest potential, has been disarmed;that is, genes that are necessary for producing plant disease have beenremoved from the vector. The vector has been tested and shown to be nonpathogenicto susceptible plants.5. The vector agent, the bacterum that was used to deliver the vector DNAand the insect resistant gene into the plant cells, has been shown to beeliminated and no longer associated with the transformed tobacco plants.6. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering and inserting the gene into the tobacco genome (i.e.,chromosomal DNA). The vector does not survive in the transformed plant.No horizontal movement mechanism is known to exist in nature to move aninserted gene from a chromosome of a transformed plant to any other organisms.7. The toxic polypeptide produced by the insect resistant gene is calleddelta-endotoxin. Upon ingestion, the toxin kills only lepidopteran insects.Delta-endotoxin is not toxic to most other insects, wild or domestic birds,fish or mammals.8. The field test site is 73 feet wide by 200 feet long and is physicallyisolated from many species of wild plants and animals by irrigation canalsand a surrounding area of cultivated land.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) The National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA regulations implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS guidelines implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC, this 8th day of June, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
