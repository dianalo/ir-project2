Lenders last week were asking, on average, an 11.02% interest rate on 30-year, conventional fixed-rate mortgages, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. That was slightly above the 10.99% rate of the previous week, and well above the 10.1% rate of a year earlier. Conventional mortgages aren't insured by the government.    Rates for fixed-rate loans haven't been as high since Dec. 27, 1985, when the average rate was 11.09% in the Freddie Mac survey. In 1986, except for slight upturns in late April and mid-September, rates moved steadily downward, setting off a nationwide avalanche of home buying and refinancing.    Rates continued declining until April 1987, when they began to turn upward, in what analysts said was a reaction to such factors as an increase in the prime lending rate and the falling dollar.    Increasingly, fixed mortgage rates have tended to track developments in the bond market. According to several analysts, mortgage rates recently have been adjusted because of investor reaction to signs that &quot;the best of inflation is behind us. The market is reacting to concern about future inflationary increases by moving rates upwards,&quot; said J. Timothy Howard, chief economist for the Federal National Mortgage Association. On Thursday, the government reported that consumer prices in August increased 0.5%, or at a 5.8% annual rate. The increase was the sharpest since January.    Rates for adjustable-rate mortgages aren't rising nearly as fast as those for the fixed-rate loans. According to the Freddie Mac survey, lenders last week asked an initial average rate of 7.99% on 30-year conventional adjustable mortgages indexed to one-year Treasury notes, the same as the week before.    The difference of more than three percentage points between the average rates for fixed and adjustable loans -- which Freddie Mac chief economist Robert Van Order said is the largest gap since the survey began in 1984 -- makes it likely that consumers will turn to adjustable loans in even greater numbers. Recently, more than half of all loans closed have had adjustable rates, according to lender surveys.    &quot;A lot of people are going to like the lower payments (of adjustable loans) initially, although we should probably expect the gap to close,&quot; Mr. Van Order said.    Mr. Van Order said that rates can be expected to fluctuate on a day-to-day basis in the short term and that future increases are likely, although he didn't expect drastic increases for the rest of the year.    &quot;The fire seems to be taken out,&quot; agreed Mark Obrinsky, economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions. </TEXT></DOC>
