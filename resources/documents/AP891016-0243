The Fed commitment came as the Bush administration continued itsown efforts to reassure investors reeling from Friday's 190-pointplunge in the Dow Jones industrial average.   White House Budget Director Richard Darman, who in recent weekshas been critical of the Fed's handling of monetary policy,expressed total confidence Sunday that the central bank and othergovernment officials will do all that is necessary to contain themarket turmoil.   Darman said that Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and Richard Breeden, the newchairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, were keeping inclose contact monitoring developments.   ``I am sure they will do what is right, what is prudent, what issensible,'' Darman said in an interview on ABC's ``This Week withDavid Brinkley.''   Darman declined to predict the course of the market Monday, andPresident Bush gave no indication that he heard shouted questionsabout Wall Street as he returned to the White House from a weekendat Camp David.   Meanwhile, a senior Fed official said Sunday that the centralbank intended to follow the example that Greenspan set followingthe October 1987 market crash.   ``We will be there with all the liquidity demand that isneeded,'' said the official, who spoke on condition that his namenot be used. ``If there are any doubts about liquidity beingavailable, there is no reason to be concerned.''   The term ``liquidity'' refers to the ready availability of cash.   The Greenspan-led effort two years ago was widely credited withkeeping the 508-point plunge of October 1987 from wreaking havoc onthe banking system and perhaps toppling the entire country into arecession.   While a Fed move to inject massive amounts of cash into thebanking system cannot by itself push stock prices higher, it doesprovide a measure of confidence that the government is prepared tocounteract the damaging effects to the economy from a sudden lossof billions of dollars of wealth in stock prices.   The Fed's action to supply cash on a liberal basis to thebanking system serves to reassure nervous bankers that they do notneed to be panicked into cutting off credit to brokerage houses andsecurities firms suffering heavy losses from a plunge in stockprices.   Brokerage firms, assured of a line of credit from their bankers,are not forced to sell off stocks as the price plunges simply toreplenish their own dwindling supplies of cash. Such waves offorced stock sales can have the unintended effect of driving stockprices down even further.   The Fed official said in a telephone interview that the U.S.central bank had been in touch with central banks in Japan andEurope and had received assurances from them that those officialsstood ready to supply needed cash in their countries to counteractany possible fallout from Friday's plunge in stock prices.   Officials at both the Fed and the Treasury were closelymonitoring developments in the overseas markets, primarily Tokyoand Hong Kong. Developments in those markets could set the tone forhow U.S. markets perform when they open Monday morning.   Stocks were down sharply in the first few minutes of tradingMonday on the Tokyo Stock exchange and the dollar was also comingunder heavy selling pressure, but they steadied in later trading.   The Federal Reserve was expected to join with the Bank of Japanand other nations' central banks to buy dollars on foreignexchanges in an effort to keep the U.S. currency from tumblingprecipitously.   Aides to Brady said the Treasury secretary had spent the weekendon the telephone coordinating the administration's efforts tocontain the damage from Friday's market drop.   Officials said they were mindful that the record 508-plunge ofthe stock market on Black Monday in 1987 had been preceded by a109-point fall the previous Friday.   ``Things are quite different now than they were in 1987, but noone knows what is going to happen Monday,'' a Treasury official,who spoke on condition his name not be used, said Sunday.   Brady is insisting that regardless of what happens in themarkets, there should be little impact on the total U.S. economy,which is about to enter a record eighth year of expansion.   Many private economists said they supported that view.   Michael Evans, head of a Washington forecasting firm, said thateven though he was looking for another big selling day Monday, hewas not changing his overall economic forecast for moderate growthnext year. He said the economy would be bolstered by growth in U.S.export sales and continued consumer spending.   ``The average consumer west of the Hudson River is going to saythis market plunge is just a bad rerun. They saw this movie twoyears ago and didn't get hurt so why should they worry now,'' Evanssaid.   Before Friday's market plunge, Darman and others in theadministration had been pressuring the Fed to lower interest ratesin order to spur economic growth and also to drive the dollar loweras a way of supporting U.S. export sales. Fed officials had beenresisting that pressure, contending that the dangers from inflationremained too great to significantly loosen credit.   While increasing the supply of money to the banking system couldhave the effect of lowering interest rates, the Fed officialstressed that the central bank has the ability to add cash to thebanking system now to take care of any short-term liquidityproblems and then drain off those extra reserves later when themarket turmoil has subsided.   Such an operation would have the effect of leaving interestrates essentially unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
