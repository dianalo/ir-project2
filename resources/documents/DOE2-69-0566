Special attention is given tostudies conducted by the United States, United Kingdom, Australian, French,Japanese, New Zealand, South African, and Japanese teams in Antarctica,that contributed to the information in the areas of dayside aurora, auroralconjugacy, thermospheric dynamics, and wave-particle interactions. Theadvantages obtained by the use of monochromatic imaging devices are discussed;this technique, used in conjunction with various detectors and sophisticatedimage-processing methods is considered to be the instrumentation of choicefor future optical studies of upper atmosphere. 75 references.</TEXT></DOC>
