White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GM </CO><IN> ERN AUT </IN><DATELINE> DETROIT  </DATELINE><TEXT>   General Motors Corp., citing a strong turnaround in international operations, said fourth-quarter net income more than doubled from the weak year-earlier period.    Without an $800 million gain in 1987 from accounting changes, however, GM's full-year earnings would have been slightly less than in 1986. The company's North American business remained weak, with profit falling to half the 1986 level.    In the latest quarter, GM net income rose to $835.8 million, or $2.36 a share, from $382.3 million, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings in the year-earlier period were depressed by a $1.22 billion pretax charge to reflect plant closing costs and other restructuring expenses. Revenue in the latest quarter rose 3.3% to $26.38 billion from $25.53 billion.    GM's quarterly earnings equaled or surpassed most analysts' estimates. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, GM rose $1.625 to close at $62.875.    In a letter to shareholders yesterday, GM Chairman Roger B. Smith highlighted the good news in boldfaced type. GM, he wrote, had a &quot;dramatic improvement&quot; in international operations, which recorded a $1.88 billion profit in 1987, compared with a $568.2 million loss in 1986.    In addition, Mr. Smith wrote, GM's finance arm, General Motors Acceptance Corp., had record profit in 1987, and profits were up sharply at GM's technology units, GM Hughes Electronics Corp. and Electronic Data Systems Corp. Cost-cutting efforts are producing better than expected results, Mr. Smith said.    Automotive capital spending was cut to $6.3 billion in 1987 -- $1.6 billion below original budget, and well below the $10.6 billion spent in 1986. Total capital spending in 1987 was $7.1 billion. In 1988, it will be &quot;in the $7 billion range, and you'll see it tail down from there,&quot; said GM President Robert C. Stempel.    Mr. Smith's letter said GM spent more than $700 million last year to buy back 7.3 million common shares, 3.1 million Class E shares and 1.1 million Class H shares -- after a split -- as part of a previously announced buy-back program. In 1987, GM had an average of 315.8 million common shares outstanding, 52.6 million Class E shares and 130.8 million Class H shares.    But for the second straight year, the company's U.S. vehicle operations didn't generate enough profit to trigger profit-sharing payouts to hourly and certain salaried workers. About 5,000 top GM executives, however, shared stock awards with a value of $157 million in December under the company's new, stock-only executive bonus program; it replaced the cash-and-stock bonus program abolished last year.    &quot;Much of their basic manufacturing improvement did come about from Europe,&quot; said Ann Knight, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc. &quot;Without that, (the results) would have been feeble.&quot;    For the year, GM net income rose 21% to $3.55 billion, or $10.06 a share, from $2.94 billion, or $8.21 a share. The earnings gain came despite a 9.4% decline in world-wide vehicle sales, and a 1% decline in overall revenue to $101.78 billion from $102.81 billion in 1986.    Without the $800 million benefit from more liberal accounting for depreciation and amortization of plants, equipment and special tools, GM's 1987 net income would have been slightly lower than in 1986. GM has said its new accounting methods merely bring the company into line with other domestic auto makers.    In the U.S. and Canada, GM earnings dropped 49% to $1.75 billion last year from $3.44 billion in 1986. North American vehicle operations earned &quot;less than $100 million,&quot; Mr. Stempel said. GM's U.S. market share skidded to 36.5% from 41% in 1986, and the company has closed plants and fired 36,000 white-collar workers since mid-1986 in an effort to slash costs. Those efforts, along with an attempt to revitalize the vehicle lineup, took a short-term toll last year; GM said it spent $450 million more in 1987 on employee severance payments and on new model start-up costs than it did the year before.    The continued low earnings from GM's domestic vehicle operations are &quot;obviously a source of great concern,&quot; said Donald F. Ephlin, United Auto Workers vice president in charge of the union's GM department. While the UAW regretted the omission of profit-sharing payments, it declined to comment immediately on the executive bonuses.    Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford Motor Co. said yesterday it expects to release fourth-quarter earnings next week. </TEXT></DOC>
