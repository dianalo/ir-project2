<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-39-0648 </DOCNO><TEXT>A numerical analysis of the classical loss mechanisms in the heliac TJ-IIis presented. By using a guiding centre orbit code in flux co-ordinates,it is found that collisionless direct losses can be eliminated by electricdrift effects for potentials of the order of the ion temperature. Neoclassicallosses resulting from the interaction of collisions and complex orbitsare calculated by solving the drift kinetic equation. When electric driftsare included, the resulting transport coefficients are comparable tothose of a tokamak with the same aspect ratio and a rotational transformequal to the transform per field period in TJ-II. In the absence of auxiliaryheating, the expected energy confinement time in TJ-II is 2.5 ms, andit decreases with increasing ion temperature. (author). 24 refs, 11 figs,2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
