The National Transportation Safety Board made the recommendationon Tuesday as part of its final report on last year's fatal crash ofa Ryan Air Service plane in Homer, Alaska, that killed 18 people.   The report said the accident was ``partially survivable,'' butfound that none of the passenger seats withstood impact when theBeech 1900-C twin-engine turboprop skidded to the ground just shortof the Homer Airport runway. There were only three survivors.   Although the seats on the Ryan Air flight met current FAAstandards, NTSB staff investigators and board members said therecould have been fewer casualties if the aircraft's seats weredesigned better. For years, board member Jim Burnett said, the NTSBhas been urging the FAA to adopt the tougher standards.   ``Adding to the severity of the accident was the failure of theFAA to adopt adequate standards for seat design,'' Burnett said.   The FAA already requires new commuter airliners to have improvedpassenger seats, and is considering a rule that would requireexisting commuter planes to have older seats replaced with thebetter models, FAA spokeswoman Theresa Greco said.   The NTSB blamed the Nov. 23, 1987, crash on the flight crew'sinadequate supervision of cargo loading before takeoff. The 2,100pounds of cargo was loaded too far to the aircraft's rear, causingthe pilot to lose control when he attempted to land, the board said.   ``The captain should have known,'' said acting NTSB ChairmanJames L. Kolstad.   The board's report concluded that the crew members, who werekilled, ``employed improper procedures to determine the airplane'sweight and balance.''   Te plane had a crew of two and 19 passengers _ many of themhunters traveling with guns and boxes of frozen venison _ when itplummeted to the ground short of the runway.   Investigators had believed that ice on the plane may have causedthe crash, but the board said the ice ``did not cause but may haveexacerbated the loss of control.''   Ryan Air had served more than 80 communities in Alaska, making itthe state's biggest commuter airliner. But the carrier has suffered10 accidents in the last eight years, including four fatal crashes,and was facing fines from the FAA for poor record-keeping and otherdeficiencies.   The airline has sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11of federal bankruptcy laws, and in January its planes were groundedas part of a consent agreement with the FAA. It resumed flying inJuly, with 11 planes serving 36 cities.   The staff report was adopted on a 4-1 vote, with Burnett votingno because he first wanted to see changes in wording that wereagreed to in the board's meeting.</TEXT></DOC>
