Since 21 years of military rule ended last year in the world's most heavily indebted country, the most powerful politicians in Brazil have been President Jose Sarney and his chief of staff, Marco Maciel. But both men, essentially conservative figures who worked closely with the former dictatorship, emerged weakened from the November vote.    The real winner was the Brazilian Democratic Movement, an amorphous party whose rapid advance to political dominance is tied to its anti-military record and appeal to the country's dispossessed. It won 22 of 23 state governorships and an absolute majority in congress.    Meanwhile, Mr. Maciel, whose Liberal Front party represents business and landowning interests, has been humiliated. Mr. Sarney has become more deeply beholden to the Democratic Movement, a party of which he is a member but whose left-leaning roots he doesn't share.    The balance in the Democratic Movement-Liberal Front coalition, for which Mr. Sarney acted as the fulcrum, has been shattered. Most important, the expectations of 80 million poverty-stricken Brazilians have been raised while the conservative establishment is worried.    These changes are taking place in an atmosphere poisoned by deep economic woes. Recent rioting in Brasilia was the worst in the capital's 26-year history. A newspaper opinion poll indicated last week that President Sarney's popularity rating had plunged to 17% from more than 80% before the elections.    The immediate reason for the riots and for Mr. Sarney's abrupt fall from grace was a government package of sharp fiscal constraints and price increases announced while election votes were still being counted. For political gain -- but at great economic cost -- these had been delayed until after the poll. The measures were essential to curb a consumer-spending spree that is eating up Brazil's trade surplus, which it needs to pay interest on its $105 billion foreign debt, and to damp a resurgence of inflation, which had been suppressed for nine months by the so-called Cruzado economic plan.    Although the package specifically targeted the middle classes by concentrating on luxury items, it sparked a sense of betrayal among the povo, the mass of traditionally passive Brazilian poor effectively enfranchised by the Democratic Movement and lured into the marketplace for the first time by the Cruzado Plan's price freeze and resultant economic boom.    Their anger, expressed both in the riot and a call for a general strike, brought them onto the political and economic scene. They are the new and unpredictable constituency of the Democratic Movement, a force sociologist Fernando Henrique Cardoso calls &quot;the first mass party in Brazilian history.&quot;    Both the Democratic Movement and Mr. Sarney know a democratic Brazil can no longer ignore them. Allusions to the duty of the &quot;New Republic&quot; to help the underprivileged masses in a society marked by extremes of wealth and poverty have been stepped up.    The question is, can the Democratic Movement and the president deliver on the hopes raised by their rhetoric and the largely illusory prosperity of the Cruzado Plan's first months? If they can't, and disturbances persist, the right-wing establishment might try to unlock the barracks doors. The conservative Liberal Front already has disassociated itself from the latest economic measures.    The dilemma is acute because Brazil is running out of resources. It has reached the limits of a balancing act involving rapid growth, quelling inflation, satisfying foreign creditors and pursuing policies compatible with nationalist pride.    The entry of millions of people into the Brazilian marketplace can't be reversed; even if economically feasible, it isn't politically doable. This means the huge trade surpluses that have allowed Brazil to service its foreign debt probably aren't sustainable. This year's surplus may be less than $10 billion, rather than the $12.8 billion predicted.    Moreover, with industry at full capacity, increased imports of machinery and components are essential to sustain growth. Also essential is the foreign investment and credit that will come only once Brazil patches up its relations with the international financial community.    For domestic reasons, Brazil has refused to accept International Monetary Fund restrictions, poisoning relations with its government and bank creditors.    But the U.S. has signaled a softening of its insistence that Brazil adopt an IMF program, opening the way for loan restructuring by government creditors, who meet next week in Paris. Brazilian officials will then ask banks to postpone $73 billion of the country's debt.    If these negotiations fail, domestic pressure for a debt moratorium could grow. Or, in a desperate drive to meet payments, the country could plunge into recession and worsened political turmoil. </TEXT></DOC>
