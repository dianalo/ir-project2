The International Energy Agency also predicted in its MonthlyOil Market Report that demand for the cartel's oil would rise inthe second half of the year to about 20.85 million barrels a day,up from a previous estimate of 20.4 million barrels.   The ministers of the 13-nation Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries were meeting in Vienna to set new price andproduction guidelines for the rest of the year. The ministersopened their formal strategy meeting Monday, then adjourned to holdprivate bargaining sessions.   Estimates of demand for their crude were heavily influencingdiscussions.   Today, Mana Saeed Otaiba, oil minister of the United ArabEmirates, a persistent overproducer in the cartel, said he wouldlike to see OPEC boost its daily production to between 20 millionand 21 million barrels from the current 18.5 million barrels.   Otaiba refused to say how much he'd like of the extra output.The primary issue in the talks, he said, ``is to get everybodywithin the new umbrella of 20 or 20 plus (million barrels a day) asa new ceiling.''   ``There's definitely movement toward an agreement,'' said Iraq'soil chief, Issam Abdul Raheem al-Chalabi, but he did not elaborate.   No date was set for resumption of their formal talks.   Anticipating more demand for their crude, the ministers seemedintent on fixing a higher output ceiling _ of as much as 20 millionbarrels a day _ for the second half of the year.   The ministers also appeared to be leaning toward retaining theirbenchmark price of $18 a barrel. Saudi Arabia has recommendeddiscontinuing the target price.   The sticking point in their bargaining is how to divide up theextra output among the 13 countries. Kuwait and the United ArabEmirates want a bigger share of any increase.   The energy agency's report said OPEC production in May roseabout 500,000 barrels from April.   ``This was primarily the result of higher production in Kuwaitand Nigeria, partly offset by a small decline in Iranian andEcuadorian production,'' it said.   Oil futures prices recently have been rising amid speculationabout the outcome of the OPEC meeting. Other developments alsohelped drive up energy prices Monday, including the death ofAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Soviet gas pipeline explosion andturmoil in China.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for Julydelivery of West Texas intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.crude oil, rose 38 cents to $20.52 a barrel Monday. Prices ofrefined products also rose.</TEXT></DOC>
