Bred in palaces, educated by court tutors, Sheik Jabbar seems anunlikely man for a historic decision on democracy.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  KUWAIT'S FEUDALISM TO CLASH WITH DEMANDSFOR DEMOCRACYEMIR'S TRACK RECORD DOESN'T FAVOR CHANGE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  AnalysisWar in the GulfSee also related article on page 1A and 12A-16A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     His track record is anything but democratic, and it is this personalhistory of the emir that has led to so much suspicion about the family'scontinual pledges to renew democracy.;    The emir heads a family thatincludes 1,000 male members (females are not considered in any count). It is aclosed and exclusive club that outsiders rarely penetrate. The emir's privateaffairs are veiled in secrecy and most Kuwaitis cannot tell you a single factabout him.;    Many will regale you though with the mythology that surroundsthe emir's many wives and the estimated 40 offspring they have brought him.Under Islamic law, men can take temporary wives, and it was a law of which theemir was said to take regular advantage.;    Lesser mortals in the Sabahfamily were by tradition obliged to marry other Sabahs. Marriage outside thefamily was frowned on, especially for Sabah women.;    It is a family used tomoney and privilege from birth. Compared with other gulf families, whoconsider their nation's oil income to be their own to plunder at will, theSabah family has to a large extent been constrained by a historic tradition ofparliamentary rule and politicians.;    Like other gulf-ruling families, eachmember of the Sabah clan receives a monthly salary, just for being a Sabah.The amount will vary depending on where they are in the pecking order. Onemajor difference is that the money comes from the emir's privy purse, which isvoted on each year by the National Assembly.;    In the last budget it wasthought to have been $24 million. These salaries are a mere drop in the oceancompared with the overall Sabah family fortune, notched up by decades oflucrative land ownership in Kuwait, real estate deals and foreign stockportfolios administered by foreign advisers.;    The emir's personal wealthhas been estimated to be around the $5 billion-$6 billion mark.;    For thejunior members of the Sabah family, life before the invasion was a bed ofroses. The more delinquent and arrogant among them drove flashy cars and threwtheir weight around in the manner of medieval feudal lords. In later years,they got the best jobs at the ministries and a slice of the business action.;   Such ventures into business broke the 250-year-old agreement with thecountry's merchant community whereby the Sabahs did not participate inbusiness. It was a system of privileges and wealth that many Sabah within thefamily, particularly some of the younger generation, will want to hold on to.;   Sheik Jabbar's track record on democracy doesn't look encouraging. In 1976when he was crown prince and prime minister, the National Assembly was beingparticularly truculent over the budget and other government business.Political groups in parliament had also been pushing for an end to the ban onpolitical parties. Sheik Jabbar resigned along with his government, promptingthe dissolution of the National Assembly by the emir.;    At the time it wasthought that Saudi pressure, nervous at all the hot air and foreign-policydebate going on in the Kuwaiti parliament about Lebanon, led to the suspensionof the assembly.;    A year later, Sheik Jabbar became emir on the death ofSheik Sabah al-Salem al-Sabah. He didn't call elections again until 1981,despite the fact that the constitution required a poll two months after thesuspension of the assembly.;    By then Kuwait found itself the eye in thestorm. The rise to power of the Islamic government in Tehran and Iran-Iraq warled to growing concern over the country's security and in particular its Shiaminority.;    At the time, most Kuwaitis were too preoccupied making millionsof dinars on the country's illegal stock market, the Souk al-Manakh. It was acasino that absorbed even the nation's teen-agers. The sheer volume of moneychasing outlets of investment led to the formation of a semi-legal secondarystock market and a bubble of forward dealing paid for by post-dated checks.When the bubble burst, and the 29,000 post-dated checks were collected, theyamounted to a staggering $96 billion.;    The result devastated every bank andcommercial asset in Kuwait. The tangle of debt took years to sort out and costbillions of dollars. Politicians blamed the government for the mess.;    Theparliamentary investigation of the Manakh scandal got uncomfortably close tosenior members of the Sabah family. The probing occurred as a series ofterrorist attacks took place in Kuwait. The explosions happened shortly afterthe Iranian occupation of the Faw peninsular in Iraq, just a few miles fromKuwait's border.;    One attack occurred on the life of Sheik Jabbar andresulted in the death of his bodyguard. It was a very close escape. Othermembers of the Sabah family were caught on a Kuwaiti airliner hijacked byHizbollah sympathizers.;    Sheik Jabbar duly dissolved the assembly onceagain and suspended the article of the constitution that stipulated freshelections within two months. Rigid press censorship was imposed, leaving blankspaces over the pages of Kuwait's once vigorous free press. Once again,political life was suspended at the swish of a sheik's pen.;    It was notuntil last year, just months before the invasion, that fresh elections wereheld. Before elections went ahead, Sheik Jabbar announced that parliamentwould be expanded to take in 25 of his own nominees. The result was a rash ofnationwide demonstrations and a virtual boycott of the polls by theestablished political groups. That was where things stood before SaddamHussein's armies moved in.;    The Iraqi invasion is said to have traumatizedthe emir into a paralysis of decision-making. Kuwaitis in regular contact withthe exile government in Taif, Saudi Arabia, say that Sheik Jabbar has playedlittle role in the negotiations with the opposition, choosing to leave much ofthe government's business to his cousin, Sheik Saad bin Abdullah, the crownprince and prime minister. The emir is said to be &quot;out of it,&quot; depressed,preferring seclusion and privacy.;    His current withdrawal from the loop ofdecision-making has thrust Sheik Saad to the forefront. Saad has now beennominated for what could become the most powerful job in the land for the nextthree months at least -- martial-law administrator.;    Sheik Jabbar'sdecision to implement martial law has once again suspended political debate.Political meetings have been banned, and there is talk of special courts totake care of &quot;Iraqi agents.&quot;;    The attempt on the life of an oppositionmember of parliament, Hamad al-Juwaan, has only helped draw the lines morefirmly between the government and the opposition.;    Ultimately, the decisionrests, as usual, with the man in the palace, Sheik Jabbar. It will be up tohim to decide if democracy, despite its raucousness and untidiness, will provethe ingredient for Kuwait's long-term stability.;    His decision coulddetermine just how much longer the Sabah rule and dominate Kuwait.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KATHY EVANS, London Observer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910305  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  16A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,289  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday March 5, 199100065085,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
