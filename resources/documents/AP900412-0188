They have disdained Soviet soldiers for decades, but Poles seemto understand Mazowiecki's point.   Poland has not joined Czechoslovakia and Hungary in the rush tobe free of the Red Army _ not because it loathes the ``occupiers''less, but because it fears the army of a reunited Germany at leastas much.   The Solidarity prime minister, leader of the first non-Communistgovernment to take office in the former Soviet bloc, envisions aSoviet withdrawal only within an overall security arrangement forEurope.   A survey by television's Center for Public Opinion Research inMarch indicated 47 percent of Poles felt the Red Army should go,but the date should depend on events in Germany.   ``Maybe a year ago, people would say the Soviet troops shouldn'tbe here, that their presence was more like a political presence,''said Franciszek Grzywacz, a magazine editor in the garrison town ofLegnica. ``Now people are saying it is a kind of a shield againstGermany.''   Poland's predicament is as old as its geographical positionbetween Germany and Russia, and has led new voices to utter aversion of the old regime's argument.   For decades, the Communists used the danger from Germany,combined with the general threat from the West, to support Poland'salliance with Moscow and the Red Army presence.   Most estimates put the number of Soviet soldiers in Poland at40,000 to 45,000, well below the 380,000 in East Germany, 80,000 inCzechoslovakia and 65,000 in Hungary.   Those in Poland, however, form the supply link from the SovietUnion to the East German frontier of the Warsaw Pact.   One of the most important Soviet military headquarters, theWestern Theater of Military Operations, is in Legnica, insouthwestern Poland, 55 miles from East Germany. The headquarterswould coordinate a Warsaw Pact offensive, using the Baltic fleet,air force support and troops from across Eastern Europe.   Legnica, 250 miles southeast of Warsaw, is one of the few placesin Poland where the Red Army is visible. The well-preserved paintedbrick architecture is a reminder of the town's place in the swathof Silesian territory taken from Germany after World War II.   Most of its 100,000 people, however, are Poles uprooted fromeastern territories annexed by the Soviet Union under Josef Stalin.   That adds emotion to the atmosphere as Soviet officers strollthe streets and black Russian limousines rush commanders to andfrom prewar mansions in a vast Red Army compound enclosed by by a7-foot concrete wall.   Tales of Soviet army abuses are legion: secret installations inthe forest, bombs gone astray, ditches running black with leakingfuel from military airports, low-flying planes buzzing farms.   Russian-bashing is a popular sport: Soviet soldiers liverent-free and make slums of the scarce apartments denied to Poles,cover windows with copies of Pravda instead of curtains, throwgarbage out the windows, favor strip shows, are above Polish lawwhen they commit crimes or cause traffic accidents.   ``If the Soviets go home, people in this town will have nothingto talk about,'' said Grzywacz, the magazine editor.   Teacher Jolanta Tochinecka does not see the Red Army as asafeguard. ``Poles know they can rely only on themselves,'' hesaid. ``That was shown in 1939,'' when the German invasion ofPoland started World War II.   Scrawled slogans may say ``Tanks to the Volga,'' and one roughlytranslates to ``Soviets go back to your garbage,'' but the soldiersare an economic benefit to Legnica.   There is a brisk trade in Soviet gold and television setsoutside the elegant turn-of-the-century officers' center.Shopkeepers rely on the well-paid soldiers and their families, whorelish the relatively comfortable five-year tours in Poland.   Residents speak gratefully of access to sophisticated hospitalsand some other facilities _ the Soviets have their own schools,police force, book stores and work crews _ but the communities arelargely separate.   ``There are not two sides of town,'' Grzywacz said. ``There aretwo cities.''   Soviet troops came to Poland ``temporarily'' under a 1956agreement that contains assurances of Polish sovereignty andprovisions that the Kremlin will pay for their upkeep.   In Czechoslovakia and Hungary, negotiations already have turnedSoviet soldiers toward home. The Red Army has been in thosecountries since it crushed Hungary's anti-Stalinist uprising of1956 and the Czechoslovak ``Prague spring'' liberalization of 1968.   It was Moscow that proposed talks on leaving Poland.Mazowiecki's government announced in March that discussions wouldbegin on finances and the ``inconveniences'' suffered bycommunities where Soviet soldiers are stationed.   The Polish subsidy for the troops amounted to 26 billion zlotys($2.7 million) in 1989, according to statistics compiled by RadioFree Europe.   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa has demanded the Soviets withdrawthis year, but government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska saidin mid-March:   ``Poland is at work on the proposals to be presented during theVienna negotiations regarding the overall withdrawal of Soviettroops in the context of a new European security system.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, April 20</NOTE></DOC>
