RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today let stand a ruling thatbarred television and still cameras and radio broadcasting equipmentfrom a Teamsters Union embezzlement trial.   The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by mediarepresentatives in Cleveland who said banning broadcast andphotographic coverage of an important union corruption case violatesthe Constitution's free-press guarantees.   The late union president Jackie Presser and two local Teamstersofficials in Cleveland were indicted in 1986 on charges theyviolated a federal anti-racketeering law by embezzling union funds.The three were accused of keeping so-called ```ghost employees'' onthe payroll of Teamsters Local 507.   Presser, who died in July of cardiac arrest before the trialbegan, was an FBI informant who said he participated in thepayroll-padding scheme with the bureau's approval.   The trial of the two others, Local 507 President Harold Friedmanand secretary Anthony Hughes, began Oct. 12.   In 1987, TV news reporter Mike Conway, radio news broadcasterJudy Thompson and photographer Ted Schwartz asked to be allowed tobring cameras and other equipment into the courtroom to cover theupcoming trial.   U.S. District Judge George W. White rejected their request.   Banning cameras and the other broadcast equipment ``serves thesignificant government interest of promoting fair and accuratefact-finding by assuring that litigants and witnesses are notdistracted by media shyness or showboating,'' White said.   The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld White's ruling inJuly.   The appeals court noted that a 1981 Supreme Court ruling said theConstitution permits the broadcasting, televising or photographingof criminal trials.   But, the appeals court said, that ``is a far cry from holdingthat the Constitution does require that these activities bepermitted during judicial proceedings.''   The media representatives said banning such coverage of trials``promotes nothing more than federal judicial insularity.''   They said, ``Limiting access to a trial to the print media aloneand to those few members of the public fortunate enough to squeezeinto the courtroom in a case of great public interest deniesfirst-hand, real-time access to tens of millions of citizens.''   They also said that modern technology permits TV cameras andradio equipment to be used unobtrusively.   Most states permit some electronic media coverage of judicialproceedings. But the federal courts, including the Supreme Court,ban such coverage.   The case is Conway vs. U.S., 88-601.</TEXT></DOC>
