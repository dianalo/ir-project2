The Kansas senator, speaking to an American Stock Exchangeconference for international investors, said he doesn't think eitherDemocrats or Republicans in Congress are going to be looking for taxincreases.   But he said corporate buyouts do not contribute to the economy,and referred to tax deductions on buyout loans as loopholes in thetax code.   Dole denied what he said are media assertions that he would makeit difficult for Bush to keep his no-tax pledge. The pledge is``fine with me,'' Dole said. ``My suggestion is that he'll have towork that out with the Democrats.''   He said Bush's plan for a ``flexible freeze'' on expenditures``makes some sense.''   Dole also praised Bush's designation of his campaign chairman,former Treasury Secretary James Baker, as secretary of state, sayingthe appointment would be ``well received by the Congress and wellreceived by the people of the United States.''   Referring to concern over Bush's selection of Dan Quayle, who isto be the next vice president, Dole said, ``I think today heindicated he's going to continue picking top people.'' Dole said ofBaker, ``His reputation is solid.''   Dole said he probably would have agreed to be Bush's running matehad he been asked.   Responding to concerns abroad that Quayle could become president,Dole said, ``If some tragedy should happen, I believe Dan Quaylecould do it.'' He said Quayle would need a lot of help, but so wouldanyone in that circumstance.</TEXT></DOC>
