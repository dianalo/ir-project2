FIRREA further requiresthe Oversight Board to prescribe by regulations, procedures for ensuringthat any individual who performs any function or service on behalf of theRTC meets minimum standards of competence, experience, integrity, and fitness,and to review all rules, regulations, principles, procedures, and guidelinesthat may be adopted or announced by the RTC.Consistent with these requirements, the rule proposed jointly by the OversightBoard and the RTC is intended to assure fair competition in the award ofcontracts by precluding improper use of personal relationships or influence,and to prevent personal gain from the improper use of confidential informationobtained through performance of a contract. The proposed rule, in a separatesection, also contains the proposed procedures prescribed by the OversightBoard to ensure that those who perform services for or on behalf of theRTC meet minimum standards of competence, fitness, integrity, and experienceand adhere to the highest standards of ethical conduct in performing servicesfor the RTC. The proposed rule is also consistent with the relevant goalsand objectives contained in the strategic plan published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 3, 1989, 54 FR 46574.As noted in the proposed strategic plan, FIRREA requires the RTC to utilizethe private sector in carrying out its duties, including real estate andloan portfolio asset management, property management, auction marketing,and brokerage services, to the extent that such services are availableand their utilization by the RTC is practicable and efficient. The Boardand the RTC are determined to utilize the private sector's extensive experienceand expertise in the program. Such services will, however, have to be renderedto the RTC consistent with the high ethical standards mandated by the FIRREA.To assure that both Congressional objectives are fully met, the Board andthe RTC are determined that the rule as finally promulgated preserves theintegrity of the system, while, at the same time, assures the private sector'sparticipation in the program to the maximum extent feasible. The OversightBoard and the RTC are seeking comment on whether the proposed rule wouldaccomplish these objectives. The private sector is urged to participatein the rulemaking process. In the formulation of the final rule, the OversightBoard and the RTC will give due consideration to all comments and recommendationsreceived.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before January 12, 1990.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments may be mailed to John M.

Comments on the collections of informationshould be sent to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503; and to the Assistant ExecutiveSecretary (Administration), Room 6090, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,550 17th Street NW., Washington, DC 20429.The collections of information proposed by these regulations are containedin andSection;andSection; 1506.4, 1606.6, 1606.7, and 1606.10. As a group,the collections are entitled ``Fitness and Integrity Certifications forIndependent Contractors with RTC.'' This information will be used by theRTC to (1) determine if a competing contractor is barred by statute fromdoing business with the RTC and (2) evaluate competing contractors' fitnessand integrity.The estimated annual burden for the collections of information imposedby these regulations is summarized as follows: number of respondents 12,000;total annual responses 12,000; hours per response 6; and total annual burdenhours 72,000.It has been determined that these proposed regulations do not constitutea major rule for purposes of E.O. 12291.<T3>Background: </T3>The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and EnforcementAct of 1989, enacted on August 9, 1989, amended the Federal Home Loan BankAct, 12 U.S.C. 1421 <T3>et seq., </T3>by adding section 21A, which establishes the OversightBoard and the Resolution Trust Corporation (``RTC''). Section 21A(b) providesthat, in carrying out the duties of the RTC, the services of private persons(including real estate and loan portfolio asset management, property management,auction marketing, and brokerage services) shall be utilized if deemedpracticable and efficient by the RTC.In authorizing the RTC to perform its functions through the use of independentcontractors, Congress made it clear that regulations implementing section21A(p) must ensure that the independent contractors act for the publicgood. To this end, Congress required the Oversight Board to prescribe regulationsto ensure that the independent contractors the RTC employs meet minimumstandards of competence, integrity, fitness, and experience. Congress barredcertain classes of persons from contracting with the RTC. Persons who aresubject to those statutory bars are those who have:(i) Been convicted of a felony;(ii) Been removed from, or prohibited from participating in the affairsof, any insured depository institution pursuant to any final enforcementaction by any federal banking agency;(iii) Demonstrated a pattern or practice of defalcation regarding obligationsto insured depository institutions; or (iv) Caused a substantial loss to the federal deposit insurance funds.The Oversight Board and the RTC share Congress' concern that persons whoseactivities contributed to the decline of the thrift industry play no rolein contracting with the RTC. Accordingly, the proposed rules interpretthese statutory bars strictly, without unfairly penalizing persons whowere unwittingly caught by changes in the economic climate of a region.Consequently, to have demonstrated a pattern or practice of defalcationwithin the meaning of these regulations, a person must be subject to continuinglegal claims arising from two or more uncured defaults that are allegedto have resulted in losses aggregating in excess of $50,000 to one or morefinancial institutions. For a person to be subject to this restriction,both elements_uncured defaults and losses to one or more institutions_musthave occurred. If defaults have been cured, for example, by a nonrecourseborrower tendering deeds in lieu of foreclosures, one of the necessaryelements for defalcation is missing.In considering the appropriate lines to draw with regard to causing a substantialloss to the federal deposit insurance funds, the Oversight Board and theRTC believes that the Congress, by using the word ``substantial,'' clearlyintended that not every action that resulted in a loss to the insurancefunds should bar an individual from contracting with the RTC. Therefore,a ``substantial loss'' is deemed to be $50,000 or more that is caused inone of three ways. Such a loss to the funds can occur whenever (i) thereis an outstanding final judgment obtained by the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorporation (``FDIC''), the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation(``FSLIC'') and its successors, or the RTC arising from a note or otherobligation or from legal action on any theory including fraud, negligence,or breach of fiduciary duty; (ii) there is an outstanding final judgmentobtained in favor of an insured depository institution which is now heldby the FDIC, the FSLIC or its successor, or the RTC; or (iii) the insurer,having a continuing legal claim, suffers a substantial loss as a resultof the disposition of an asset. Thus, for the purposes of FIRREA conflictprovisions, not all losses sustained by the insurance funds are deemedto have been ``caused'' by a borrower. A nonrecourse borrower on a loaninvolving a loss to a federal deposit insurance fund, for example, wouldnot <T3>per se </T3>be regarded as causing a substantial loss to such fund.On the other hand, a participant in an unsafe and unsound banking practicethat resulted in such substantial loss would not meet minimum standards.The Oversight Board and the RTC have also determined that, in additionto the classes of persons Congress deemed ineligible to contract with theRTC, persons who are currently in default on an obligation to the FDIC,the RTC, or an insured depository institution under the jurisdiction ofthe RTC, will also be ineligible to contract with the RTC.<T3>Contractor Fitness and Integrity: </T3>The proposed regulations containprocedures for determining contractor fitness and integrity and avoidingconflicts of interest, as well as prohibitions designed to protect nonpublicinformation and the integrity of the contracting process. Because of thelarge numbers of contractors who wish to contract with the RTC, and theurgent need to resolve cases involving failing and failed thrifts, theregulations require contractors (including offerors) to provide certificationsthat will assist the RTC in evaluating contractor fitness and integrity.Each contractor will be required to retain for two years after the terminationdate of the contract information upon which the contractor based any certification.Moreover, contractor certifications will be subject to independent monitoringand review by the RTC. The rule further provides that knowingly or intentionallyproviding false information to the RTC can result in the rescission ofa contract, a permanent bar against contracting with the RTC, and can subjecta contractor to criminal penalties pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 1001.Contractors will be required to demonstrate that they meet minimum standardsof competence and experience by providing information about relevant businessexperience, financial stability, and licenses necessary to perform thecontract work. To establish fitness and integrity, contractors will haveto provide certifications concerning relationships with insured depositoryinstitutions, actions or investigations by governmental authorities, presentor potential liabilities to federal banking authorities, and liabilitiesto clients for fraudulent activities and will have to disclose whetherthey are within one of the classes of persons ineligible to contract withthe RTC.The certifications required by these regulations will apply to practitionersin several professions and a number of industries, including, but not limitedto, law firms, accounting firms, investment banking firms, real estatebrokers, appraisers, property managers, and auction marketing experts.Thus, the certifications detailed in the regulations primarily reflectthe core information which will be required of everyone. It is likely thatthese core certifications will be augmented by additional requirementsdepending upon the nature of the contract.Since many contractors will be corporate entities, the integrity of thecontractor cannot be ascertained unless information is supplied about theactivities of persons or entities controlling the company and directingthe contractor's performance on the contract. Therefore, contractors willbe required to provide certifications not only regarding their own activitiesbut also concerning those of their related entities. The term ``relatedentities'' has been defined as (i) the contractor's management officialswho have decisionmaking or policymaking responsibilities with regard tothe contract; (ii) persons or entities controlled by or which control thecontractor; (iii) organizations related to the contractor that will performcontract work; and (iv) successors and assigns of the contractor. Contractorswill also be required to certify that they will not employ (i) any personto participate personally and substantially in performing work on the contractwhether through decision, approval, disapproval, recommendation, or therendering of advice, or (ii) any subcontractor to perform contract work,who is a member of one of the classes deemed ineligible to perform contractwork. The definitions of persons, management officials, and related entities,limit the scope of the application of the statute to those persons havingsignificant decisionmaking or discretionary authority to perform work onthe contract.From the information provided, the RTC will determine whether each contractormeets minimum standards of fitness and integrity. In some situations, eventhough the contractor is not barred by the statutory provisions from performingcontract work, the RTC may determine that the contractor does not meetminimum standards of fitness and integrity. In such case, the contractorwill be notified within 30 days of such determination.The Oversight Board and the RTC are aware that the process of determiningcontractor fitness and integrity and the procedures for avoiding conflictsof interest are likely to require consideration of specific circumstancesin individual cases. Therefore, the RTC is designating a Contractors' ConflictsCommittee comprised of officials of the RTC and the FDIC to resolve questionswhich arise under these regulations and relate to independent contractors,other than law firms. Similar questions which relate to law firms willbe resolved by the Outside Counsel Conflicts Committee of the FDIC.The Contractors' Conflicts Committee will delegate certain responsibilitiesto regional and consolidated offices and may, at its discretion, referparticular matters to the Board of Directors of the RTC for consideration.The committee will be required to refer to the Board of Directors of theRTC for determination those matters in which it believes that a contractorhas a significant conflict of interest but nevertheless should be hiredbecause the contractor has a special expertise not otherwise availableor because engagement of the contractor is otherwise in the best interestof the Government. Decisions issued by the Contractors' Conflicts Committeeand the Board of Directors of the RTC shall be in writing and made availableto the public upon request.<T3>Conflicts of Interest:</T3> Contractors will be required to provideinformation and certifications with regard to two types of conflicts ofinterest: (i) Organizational conflicts arising from the structure and relationshipsof the contractor and its related entities, and (ii) personal conflictsof interest of those performing work on the contract. Organizational conflictsare present if (i) performance of the contract may provide a contractorwith an unintended advantage that can be used for the benefit of the contractoror any related entity or affiliate, or (ii) a private interest or relationshipexists within the contractor's organization that could impair the contractor'sor a related entity's ability to objectively perform the contract work.To determine whether organizational conflicts exist, each contractor willbe required to provide information about its relationships as controllingshareholder, officer, or director of any insured depository institution,and descriptions of businesses organizationally related to the contractor.The contractor will also be required to obtain similar information fromits related entities and to certify that its related entities have no organizationalconflicts of interest.In addition, each contractor will be responsible for ensuring that itsmanagement officials and other employees who participate personally andsubstantially on the contract work have no personal, business, or financialinterests that conflict with the contractor's responsibilities to the RTC.Accordingly, contractors will be required to obtain certain informationfrom these individuals prior to allowing them to perform contract work.That information will primarily concern the relationships of these officialsand employees, and those of their spouses and minor children, with thedepository institution whose assets are the subject of the contract andrelationships with persons having an interest in the assets that are thesubject of the particular contract. Contractors will also be required toestablish procedures to ensure that they are advised of subsequent conflictsof interest that may arise.Contractors and their related entities also will be required to adhereto certain general requirements during the term of a contract. Generally,the contractor and its related entities are prohibited from (i) continuingto perform work for the RTC if a conflict of interest is discovered thathas not been previously disclosed, (ii) soliciting or accepting gifts frompersons with interests in the contract or the contractor's performance,(iii) improperly using property controlled by reason of the contract forthe personal benefit of the contractor or any other person or entity, and(iv) making unauthorized promises or commitments on behalf of the RTC.<T3>Fairness and Integrity in the Contracting Process: </T3>The OversightBoard and the RTC intend the RTC's contracting process to be fair to allcompeting contractors. The proposed regulations describe three situationsin which contractors may have an undue advantage over competitors becauseof previous or current work done for the RTC. In those circumstances, restrictions(subject to waiver by the Contractors' Conflicts Committee) are imposedon the contractors and their related entities to avoid their benefitingfrom such undue advantage.Specifically, the regulations provide that a contractor who is engagedby the RTC to develop a plan of action for a specific insured institutioncannot, without a waiver, enter into subsequent contracts with the RTCto implement its recommendations or assist others in a contract that wouldimplement its recommendations. Similarly, when a contractor is engagedto manage, lease, value, or establish a sales price for an asset or groupof assets, the contractor cannot enter into a subsequent contract withthe RTC to purchase such asset or assets or assist someone else in purchasingsuch asset or assets from the RTC. Finally, a contractor is prohibitedfrom acting for the RTC in the same particular matter in which is has abusiness or financial interest. The contractor is similarly prohibitedif a related entity has a business or financial interest unless the entityis screened in a manner satisfactory to the RTC.The integrity of the RTC's procurement activities is further protectedby certain restrictions on communications by competing contractors withRTC employees. These provisions are modeled on the procurement integrityprovisions in title 41, United States Code. They prohibit a contractor,during the course of any procurement, from offering any business opportunityor future employment to any RTC employee who has personal or direct responsibilityfor that procurement. Contractors are also prohibited from giving or offeringanything of value to RTC employees, and from soliciting from RTC employeesany proprietary or source selection information concerning the procurement.Prior to the award of a contract, each contractor will be required to providea certification that its employees who prepared the bid, offer, or proposalwere aware of the foregoing restrictions and the contractor knows of noviolations or possible violations of the provisions.<T3>Confidentiality of Information: </T3>The RTC shall identify for eachcontractor information it deems to be confidential with regard to a particularcontract. The contractor and its related entities are prohibited from disclosingsuch information, except as necessary to perform contract work, and fromusing or allowing the use of such confidential information to further aprivate interest or other than as contemplated by the contract. The contractoris responsible for taking appropriate measures to ensure that the confidentialityof such information is maintained and that it is not inappropriately used.The regulations describe minimum measures that contractors must take toensure the confidentiality of information.<T3>Use of Consultants: </T3>The Oversight Board and the RTC intend toavoid improper influences on the contracting process. While contractorsmay wish to obtain the services of consultants or advisors to assist themin obtaining contracts, the Oversight Board and the RTC believe that reasonablelimitations should apply to the use of consultants. Therefore, these regulationsprohibit contractors from engaging consultants on a contingent fee basis.And, consistent with requirements recently enacted by Congress, contractorsshall be required to include with any bid, offer, or proposal made to theRTC information concerning consulting contracts and payments made to consultantsto obtain contracts with the RTC.<T3>Rescission of Contracts: </T3>The proposed regulations provide thatthe RTC may rescind a contract if (i) the contractor fails to disclosea material fact to the RTC; (ii) there are any material changes in therepresentations or certifications made by the contractor; (iii) a personalor organizational conflict arises which is not waived; (iv) the contractoris subsequently determined to be ineligible to contract with the RTC; (v)the contractor has been subject to a final enforcement action by any bankregulatory agency; or (vi) the contractor violates any provisions of theseregulations.If the RTC deems it appropriate to rescind a contract, the contractor willbe ineligible to enter into further contracts with the RTC. Disqualificationunder these circumstances shall also apply to related entities of the contractor,unless determined otherwise by the Contractors' Conflicts Committee. TheRTC may seek damages from any contractor or subcontractor whose actionscaused the rescission, as well as pursue any additional rights and remediesprovided by law.<T3>Regulatory Flexibility Analysis: </T3>The Oversight Board and the RTChereby certify that the proposed regulations will not, it promulgated,have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businessentities within the meaning of the regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The proposed regulations establish rules to be usedby the RTC to (1) determine if a competing contractor is barred by statutefrom doing business with the RTC and (2) evaluate competing contractor'sfitness and integrity.<T3>Regulations Promulgation: </T3>The Oversight Board and the RTC areproposing to promulgate identical regulations applicable to independentcontractors governing conflicts of interest, ethical responsibilities andthe use of confidential information consistent with the goals and purposesof titles 18 and 41 of the United States Code and are proposing to codifythese regulations in their respective parts of title 12 of the Code ofFederal Regulations. Since the regulations are identical, the text of theregulations is set out only once at the end of the common preamble.
