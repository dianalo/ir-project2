(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Florida lawmakers passed a bill makinggun owners subject to prison terms if their firearms are used bychildren to shoot someone.   The Legislature acted after accidental shootings killed threechildren since June 5.   ``We have experienced too many tragedies, and it's time to put anend to them,'' said Rep. Harry Jennings, a retired Army colonel whohas pushed the proposal for two years.   The Senate passed the gun-safety bill 26-6 and the House approvedit 71-39 on Tuesday. Gov. Bob Martinez, who was persuaded last weekto include the bill in this week's special session, was expected tosign the measure.   Under the bill, gun owners who fail to secure loaded weapons intheir homes could be charged with a felony carrying up to five yearsin prison and a $5,000 fine if children 15 years and younger hurtsomeone with the firearms.   If the child displays the gun in public, the gun owner could becharged with a misdemeanor punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a$500 fine.   Exemptions are provided for hunting and target shootingaccidents, shootings involving stolen guns and the guns of lawenforcement officers or military personnel. The law also provides aseven-day delay before parents of a wounded child can be arrested onthe felony charge.   Jennings, the bill's sponsor, described it as ``one of the mostimportant pieces of legislation that we have addressed in years inthis Legislature.''   His legislation gained national attention after three Floridachildren were killed and four wounded in seven accidents earlierthis month.   The bill requires gun-shop owners to post a sign explaining thelaw and to hand out a written warning to customers. The measure alsodirects the state Department of Education to prepare a gun-safetyeducation program that lawmakers can consider next year.   A lobbyist for the National Rifle Association said the bill wasacceptable.   ``My job was to try to help produce a bill that had the potentialto do some good and not just run willy-nilly, damaging additionallives,'' said NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer.   Rep. Dick Locke led the opponents in the House, which hadapproved a similar version during the regular session that endedJune 3.   ``This bill does not make common sense,'' Locke said. ``You can'tput Mama and Daddy in jail, the kids in a foster home, the courtsystem is full, the fails are full.''   Other opponents contended that more children are hurt and killedin accidents involving cars, pools, fires and household poisons thanguns.   Accidental gunshots are the fifth-leading cause of death of U.S.children under age 14, and Florida has one of the three highestrates of accidental shootings in the country, according to Sen.Jeanne Malchon, who proposed similar legislation two years ago.   Last year, 441 Florida children were injured or killed by gunsand another 3,110 were victims of crimes involving firearms.</TEXT></DOC>
