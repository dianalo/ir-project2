<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-0437 </DOCNO><TEXT>An experimental agitation mill was constructed for the purpose of studyingthe grinding characteristics and rheological properties of dense coal-waterslurries. These slurries were subjected to high shear-forces during themilling process. Their particle size distributions were determined anddescribed by the Rosin-Rammler equation. The energy consumed by the grindingprocess was evaluated in terms of the specific surface area of the productsand then the change of the grinding rate with time was analysed. Thepseudoplasticity of the products was measured and the non-Newtonian formulatedin terms of the power law using the pulp's consistency and flow indexas parameters. The relationship between (1) these rheological parametersand (2) the specific surface area and the grinding energy was evaluatedin order to further explain the fluid-mechanic behaviour of the agitationmill as a mixer.</TEXT></DOC>
