(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Air Force Reserve helicopter crashed andburned Sunday during a night training mission, killing 12 peopleaboard and leaving three missing, officials said.   The twin-engine CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant'' helicopter was flyingwith another chopper from Davis-Monthan Air Force to the Air Force'sGila Bend Gunnery Range when it went down at about 7:45 p.m.,according to a base spokesman, Capt. Mark Besich.   The crashed occurred in an uninhabited area 20 miles north ofTucson.   ``I looked up and I seen a yellow ball, like flames, coming outof the back,'' said Mike Skreka. ``About four seconds later it hitthe ground.''   Emergency crews from Davis-Monthan and Tucson InternationalAirport were dispatched to the scene.   Twelve people were pronounced dead at the crash site and threeothers were unaccounted for and presumed dead, said Pima CountySheriff's Sgt. Tom Taylor.   An unidentified sheriff's office dispatcher said another witnesstold deputies that he ``heard a loud pop and then saw it go down.''   The dispatcher said the second helicopter continued flying on toRyan Field, a small airport about 25 miles west of Tucson.   Besich said the CH-3E helicopter usually carries a crew of fourand has a capacity of 22 passengers. He said he knew nothing aboutthe people aboard the Vietnam-era helicopter that crashed, or howmany may have been injured.   Both helicopters are assigned to the 71st Special OperationsSquadron at Davis-Monthan, he said.   The site of the crash was about half-way between Marana, Ariz.,and Avra Valley, Ariz., according to Besich.   He said Air Force officials launched another helicopter to fly tothe crash site, but he had few details about what that crew hadlearned.   The 71st Special Operations Squadron was known as the 302ndSquadron, and based at Luke Air Force Base near Phoenix, until June1987 when it was transferred to Davis-Monthan, Besich said.   The CH-3E ``Jolly Green Giant,'' which was most noted for its usein combat rescues during the Vietnam War, is made by Sikorsky,according to Jane's All The World's Aircraft. But Boeing makesseveral Chinook helicopters with the CH-designation.</TEXT></DOC>
