Many Western companies have found themselves doing lessbusiness recently in the Soviet Union rather than more,because of the nation's chaotic political situation andsevere shortage of hard currency. The ouster of MikhailGorbachev will make Western businesses even more reluctant toinvest in the Soviet Union and will delay a number of pendingprojects, many companies and consultants said, though theinitial reaction of most businesses with operations there wasto wait for the political situation to become clear and hopefor the best.</LP><TEXT>   Business interest had perked up in recent months assniping between Mr. Gorbachev and Russian President BorisYeltsin died down. But investment activity in the SovietUnion hasn't amounted to much since early 1990. &quot;The point isthat there isn't much of a tap to turn off yet,&quot; said AndrewSeton, director in charge of Soviet and Eastern Europeanbusiness at Morgan Grenfell Group PLC, a London financialconcern. He added that even tentative plans now are likely tobe put on hold because of uncertainty over whether the newSoviet leadership will continue the process of economic andcurrency reform.   But some Western business people wondered whether the coupmight increase business activity by fostering stability. &quot;Anyshort-term influence to restore economic predictability&quot;would be welcome, said Peter Anstey, director of Du PontCo.'s Moscow office. With the outcome of Monday's eventsuncertain, Mr. Anstey and many other Western business peoplesaid that having already hunkered down for a long haul, theywould wait before jumping to any conclusions.   A return to hard-line communism could have a devastatingeffect on attempts to integrate the Soviet Union with theworld economy and expand markets for Western goods here. &quot;Idon't know of a single strong communist country that hasintegrated with the world economy,&quot; said Mr. Anstey.   There have been hints recently of an anti-Western backlashin the Soviet Union. Despite such sentiments, the Sovietparliament recently passed a foreign investment law that,among other things, guaranteed property rights in the eventof nationalization.   Such protections may not be enough to ease Westernworries. Ray R. Irani, chief executive officer of OccidentalPetroleum Corp., said that in the short run the coup probablywill slow business further between Western companies and theSoviet Union. &quot;We canceled our petrochemical project there{earlier this year} because it was too uncertain a projectduring these difficult times,&quot; Mr. Irani said. &quot;It was toolarge for the country to handle.   &quot;But in the long term, clearly there will be increasedbusiness between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It is a largecountry with a huge population. It does need its standard ofliving raised. And the place they will look to is the West,as they already have.&quot; Occidental has cut many of its tieswith the Soviet Union since Mr. Irani succeeded the lateArmand Hammer in December.   Consultants said one major project expected to be put onhold is Fiat S.p.A.'s talks on taking a 30% stake in Autovaz,the largest Soviet auto maker, and jointly developing asubcompact Uno-class car. A Fiat spokesman said it was tooearly to say what would happen to those negotiations. &quot;Likeeverybody else, we have had our difficulties reaching theSoviet Union today,&quot; a spokesman said. &quot;Everybody doingbusiness in the Soviet Union has to be worried today.&quot;   Some major oil and gas projects that have been innegotiations also are likely to be put on hold, consultantsand investment bankers said. Most often mentioned was ChevronCorp.'s plan to set up a joint venture to tap the Tengizfield in Kazakhstan. Those talks have been going on for morethan three years as the company has been batted aroundbetween authorities in Moscow and the republic.   Chevron couldn't say what impact the coup might have onthe Tengiz talks. &quot;We're watching events unfold as others areand we're in no position to speculate about events in theSoviet Union,&quot; a spokesman said.   Chevron's efforts to form the largest-ever joint venturebetween a U.S. company and the Soviet Union had become apolitical hot potato even before the coup. In recent months,the multibillion-dollar project had become a whipping boy ofthe Soviet press, which claimed Chevron stands to makeunacceptably large profits from the project. The Tengiz fieldhas reserves estimated by Soviet officials at more than 25billion barrels -- roughly 2 1/2 times those of Alaska'sPrudhoe Bay.   Atlantic Richfield Co. also has been in talks, onexploring and producing oil in eastern Siberia, that havebecome unsettled by the political turmoil. &quot;We're waiting tosee what happens hour by hour,&quot; said Michael Bowlin,president of Arco International Oil andamp; Gas Co. Arco had tworepresentatives standing by in Anchorage, Alaska, waiting forword from Siberian officials before boarding a flight to theSoviet Union for meetings later this week.   &quot;We're in the process of sending telexes to {the}officials to try to reschedule the talks,&quot; Mr. Bowlin said.&quot;When this shakes out, if there is a stable government therethat continues {Mr. Gorbachev's} momentum, then eventually wewould be very interested in investing there.&quot;   Amoco Corp., which agreed in June to help the Soviet Uniondevelop the Azeri oil field in the Caspian Sea, sounded moredetermined to proceed. &quot;Today's events don't change theeconomic and technical needs of the Soviet Union's petroleumindustry,&quot; said Patrick Early, president of Amoco ProductionCo. &quot;While no one can predict the future, we can say thatAmoco will actively pursue the oil and gas developmentprojects we've been discussing with the Soviets. We'llproceed as quickly -- yet cautiously -- as events allow.&quot;   FMC Corp., which has been doing business in the SovietUnion for about 50 years, selling primarily such items asagricultural chemicals and food-processing machinery,expressed optimism about continuing. &quot;In the past, we'velearned how to handle business {with the Soviet Union} intimes of turmoil,&quot; said Nha Hoang, international director.&quot;Even in times of peace, we've been careful to constructcontracts that hold the proper guarantees from variousgovernment agencies of the Soviet Union. Past experience hasshown us that once the Soviets sign such a contract, theywill honor it. Within two hours of the initial events,already some of our customers had gotten a hold of our officeand indicated they will honor their contracts.&quot;   Some Western telecommunications companies have been activein moving to help the Soviets to update their antiquatedphone systems. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. so far hasplaced its bets cautiously in the Soviet Union with dealsaimed mostly at improving service between the U.S. andU.S.S.R.   Like other telecommunications companies, ATandamp;T said itplans to proceed with its ventures despite the politicalupheaval. &quot;Any company going into the Soviet Union does soknowing that it faces more than ordinary business risks,&quot;said ATandamp;T vice chairman Randall L. Tobias, who was recentlyput in charge of ATandamp;T's international business. But &quot;there isso much market potential in telecommunications andinformation technology, with all the positive effects thatcould have on life in the Soviet Union. It would be a pity ifall this potential slipped into the category of what mighthave been.&quot;   A British Airways spokeswoman expressed confidence thatthe carrier's recent agreement to set up a joint venture withAeroflot, the Soviet state airline, wouldn't be affected bythe coup. The agreement, signed July 26, calls for the twocompanies to create a new airline, to be called Air Russia.   Acknowledging that British Air hadn't spoken with anyofficials in the Soviet Union after the coup, the spokeswomansaid, &quot;There's no reason to believe -- considering the stagewe've reached -- that the project won't go forward.&quot; BritishAir is to invest #20 million ($33 million) to help take AirRussia to the point of commercial viability and will have a31% stake in the airline. Air Russia is expected to startoperations in 1994.   The Soviet coup may cut off a recent export to the Easternbloc: American legal expertise. About a half dozen U.S. lawfirms have opened Moscow offices during the past few years,and others have affiliated with Soviet law firms.   Now, many of these lawyers are pessimistic about prospectsfor new business.   &quot;For the next few weeks and months, fewer people are goingto be calling saying, `How do I invest in the Soviet Union?'&quot;says James T. Hitch, a partner at Chicago-based Baker andamp;McKenzie, which has five full-time attorneys in its PushkinSquare office. &quot;More of them are going to say, `Gee, I have alease, how do I get out?'&quot;   Mr. Hitch predicts Baker andamp; McKenzie won't close its Moscowoffice, however, unless conditions become unsafe for Americanlawyers working in the Soviet Union.   Tambrands Inc. has been part of a joint venture for theproduction and sale of tampons in the Soviet Union since1988. The manufacturing facility, located about 30 milesoutside of Kiev in the Ukraine, has been operating since1989.   Paul E. Konney, senior vice president for Tambrands, saidthat the company has been in contact with its staff membersin the Soviet Union, and that the joint venture's plant isoperating as usual.   &quot;As an investor, however, this will make us even morecautious about investing any additional money, or expandingour operations in the Soviet Union,&quot; Mr. Konney says. &quot;As acompany, we don't really care who is the head of thegovernment, but we'd like to see a system of government thatremains consistent over time. The great fear is always thatthe rules will be changed.&quot;   Mr. Konney adds that the company is concerned about theeffect of the Soviet coup on governments in Eastern Europe.&quot;We think this sounds a cautionary note for the EasternEuropean markets,&quot; he says. &quot;With a more conservativegovernment in the Soviet Union, we think the opportunities inEastern Europe could be limited.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
