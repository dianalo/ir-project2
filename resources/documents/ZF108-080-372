 Similarly, Arcnet, despite having been the firstcommercially available LAN, with nodes installed as early as 1977, hastraditionally been considered the poor man's LAN.andP;  Arcnet lacked thecorporate backing or IEEE standard that Token Ring and Ethernet both enjoy,and at 2.5M-bits-per-second, it was not much competition in the eyes of thosedazzled by the 4M-bits-per-second, (and now 16M) Token Ring or10M-bits-per-second Ethernet.andP;  In reality, Arcnet not only has a substantialinstalled base and prospective ANSI accreditation, but in many cases isfaster than Ethernet.andM;Datapoint (San Antonio, Texas) developed Arcnet in the late 1970s andlicensed its technology to other companies in the early 1980s, around thesame time that Standard Microsystems (Hauppauge, N.Y.) delivered its firstsingle chip LAN controller.andP;  SMC built the first Application SpecificIntegrated Circuit (ASIC) implementation of Arcnet in 1981 and is currentlyone of the two suppliers of Arcnet controller chips, along with NCR (Dayton,Ohio).andP;  Both NCR and SMC build their chips to the same Datapointspecifications so that all cards interoperate without a hitch.andP;  That'ssomething that neither Ethernet nor Token Ring card manufacturers can claim.andM;Arcnet nay-sayers may also point to the fact that the technology is not anIEEE 802 LAN like its other two major competitors.andP;  However, by the time theIEEE rolled around to publishing a standard for Token Ring, Arcnet hadalready been on the market for five years.andP;  The main obstacle was that whileArcnet uses a locally administered, eight-bit station address format and a22-bit frame check sequence, the 802 family LANs use a globally administered,48-bit station address and a 22-bit frame check sequence format.andP;  To makeArcnet IEEE-standard would have left the existing installed base of Arcnetusers out in the cold.andP;  Instead, the Naperville, Ill.-based Arcnet TradeAssociation (ATA) is bucking to have the existing de facto Arcnet standardaccredited through the American National Standards Institute (ANSI).andM;The Deterministic MethodandM;Like Token Ring, Arcnet uses a deterministic method of data transfer asopposed to a contention method, which is used by Ethernet.andP;  Simply put, anode must have permission, in the form of an electronic token, to gain accessto the network.andP;  The broadcasting node that has access to the token transmitsits data onto the network, and once it's done, the token passes to the nextnode.andM;With an Ethernet network that uses collision detection, nodes wanting accessto the network transmit at will.andP;  In the case of a collision, both nodesretreat and rebroadcast at a random interval.andP;  With contention methodnetworks, performance suffers as usage grows due to the increasing number ofcollisions.andP;  Since Arcnet nodes have controlled access to the network, theyare able to offer consistent and predictable performance.andM;Arcnet nodes can be configured in either a star or bus topology, although thestar topology is preferable from a management point of view.andP;  Since a cablebreak on a bus or ring can bring the whole network down, it can make findingthe problem that much more difficult since there's no way of isolating it.andO;With a star topology, a break can be localized since only those nodesattached to the faulty segment of the star will be affected.andP;  The bus networkis typically used in networks of only two or three PCs, where it is notcost-effective to by an Arcnet hub.andM;Arcnet has a smaller minimum packet size than Ethernet, which can make it aspeedier alternative if small messages are being sent.andP;  Ethernet has aminimum message size of eight bytes, whereas Arcnet's is one byte and sixbits.andP;  With smaller message sizes, Arcnet's lower packet overhead is moreefficient.andP;  Despite it's obvious advantages, especially in situations whereprice is a consideration or where data is transmitted in small bursts (aswith database-intensive applications), Arcnet has consistently been judged byits 2.5M-bits-per-second tag.andP;  That began to change this past September atNetworld when Datapoint, SMC, and NCR announced ArcnetPlus, a20M-bits-per-second version of Arcnet.andM;The significant advantage of this second generation of Arcnet technology isthat it is still completely compatible with 2.5M-bits-per-second Arcnet,saving existing Arcnet users the expense of replacing all their installedArcnet cards.andP;  Nor do users have to rewire their networks to take advantageof the higher data transfer rate since ArcnetPlus uses the same wiringschemes as the original Arcnet.andM;Arcnet Plus should become a reality by the middle or end of 1990, accordingto Barry Sadler, product manager at Datapoint.andP;  As with any technology, thenew chip has to be extensively tested before being released, especially inlight of the fact that it has to be completely interoperable with theexisting Arcnet.andP;  Sadler anticipates the first silicon implementation ofArcnetPlus early in the second quarter of 1990, and an updated design inJuly.andP;  Once a completed chip is released, manufacturers can incorporate theminto their interface cards.andP;  If everything goes smoothly, ArcnetPlus shouldbe available this fall.andM;Datapoint plans to release a development kit with two full-size ArcnetPluscards with documentation and a discrete design of what the chip will looklike.andP;  Developers can purchase the kits and design products as early asFebruary 1990 to reduce the time between the chip's release and productsbecoming commercially available.andM;ArcnetPlus accomplishes its higher rate of data transfer through sine wavemodulation.andP;  In standard Arcnet, the electrical transmission of data bits isat fa basic frequency rate of 5 MHz, with the sine wave to determine whetherthe bit is a 1 or 0.andP;  The positive half of the sine wave is either high orflat, signifying a 1 or 0.andP;  The second half of the sine wave is always a 0 ornull bit.andP;  ArcnetPlus eliminates the use of the null bits, so although thefrequency is still 5 MHz, a byte can now be sent in the time it took Arcnetto send a bit.andM;ArcnetPlus also accommodates a larger packet size than the original Arcnet.andO;The largest packet size permitted on Arcnet is 516 bytes, with four bytesreserved for addressing information.andP;  ArcnetPlus has a maximum packet size of4,224 bytes, which also allows more nodes.andP;  An Arcnet network can have 255nodes and an ArcnetPlus network can have eight times as many.andM;Why Faster Is BetterandM;The best thing about ArcnetPlus is that it works with the original Arcnet.andO;When two nodes initially make a connection, a back and forth communicationestablishes an agreement between the two.andP;  When the connection is madebetween a standard Arcnet node and the new ArcnetPlus, the20M-bits-per-second version determines the speed of communication.andP;  The cardalso saves the information, so that it only has to connect to a certain nodeonce to learn the speed it operates at.andM;With ArcnetPlus, users can selectively upgrade their systems.andP;  Says Sadler,&quot;Users don't have to buy new cards for every node on the network if they wantto boost performance on certain applications.andP;  They can do a little analysisand find out where the heaviest usage occurs and replace the cards inspecific nodes with the new ArcnetPlus cards.&quot;andP;  The high-octane ArcnetPluswill communicate with the old Arcnet nodes, and, of course, with any otherArcnetPlus cards.andM;Similar to what 16M-bits-per-second Token Ring does for its slowercounterpart, ArcnetPlus can establish a high-speed backbone or create aspeedy network of multiple servers.andP;  And, of course, ArcnetPlus can use anyof the wiring schemes, such as coax, twisted-pair, or even fiber, that Arcnetuses.andP;  That makes it not only cost-effective to upgrade to the new version,but easy to install and configure.andM;In some case, the 20M-bits-per-second cards won't communicate with the stowercards, or even with one another.andP;  The standard Arcnet cards don't recognizeaddresses above 255, whereas 20M-bits-per-second nodes can be numbered to2,047.andP;  It will take a lots of planning when laying out the network to ensurethat the 20M-bits-per-second nodes above the recognizable address won't needto communicate with the lower speed cards.andM;In addition, since all the Arcnet hubs being manufactured right now are for2.5M-bits-per-second cards, 20M-bits-per-second nodes on either side of thehub can't communicate.andP;  The hubs, which work by retransmitting the electricalsignal, are built for 2.5M-bits-per-second cards.andP;  They won't be able totransmit the higher speed signal.andP;  That's a temporary problem, of course.andO;Hardware, such as hubs and monitors, will eventually be upgraded to supportthe new ArcnetPlus.andM;Jonathan Schmidt, cofounder of Performance Technology (San Antonio, Texas)and former vice president of research and development of Data-point, saysthat the dual trends in LANs focus on graphics and application servers, bothof which can be satisfied with ArcnetPlus.andP;  &quot;Whereas the average dataprocessing record is around 2,000 bytes,&quot; says Schmidt, &quot;the averagecompressed fax image is about 20,000 bytes and high-resolution graphics, suchas those used in medical imaging, run around 200,000 bytes.andP;  20M Arcnet issatisfactory for this next generation of graphics.&quot;andM;Users' speed needs, especially in graphics-intensive applications, willbypass 20M-bits-per-second Arcnet, but until those needs become a realityusers shouldn't spend too much money just fto have the bulk of theirbandwidth sit idle at a higher price.andP;  Nothing ever stands still, let aloneLAN technology.andP;  Although ArcnetPlus hasn't even made its formal appearanceyet, people are buzzing already about the inexpensive, 100M-bits-per-secondfiber optic LAN from Thomas-Conrad (Austin, Texas).andP;  TCNS, as Thomas callsits fiber-optic token passing network, will lack at least part of theinteroperability and cost-effectiveness of ArcnetPlus since it will involverunning new cable, but its should be apt for physically smaller LANs in needof high speeds.andM;Arcnet, and therefore ArcnetPlus, are ideal for application servers.andP;  A userrequests information from an application residing on a dedicated server, andthe server does the processing and returns an answer over the network.andP;  Thissmall message size is not only efficient, explaining the trend towardapplication servers, but also ideal for Arcnet, which thrives on smallpackets.andP;  ArcnetPlus will further optimize server performance.andM;Despite this bright future, people are definitely clamoring for the20M-bits-per-second Arcnet right now.andP;  &quot;I was amazed,&quot; says PerformanceTechnology's Schmidt.andP;  &quot;When I gave a speech recently on high-performanceLANs, many of the questions involved the new Arcnet.andP;  A lot of those peoplewere considering Arcnet for the first time, simply because of the 20M tag.&quot;andM;Still, says Schmidt, the best thing about the new Arcnet is itsinteroperability.andP;  &quot;The whole thing is a remarkable undertaking,&quot; saysSchmidt.andP;  &quot;It didn't seem to be fueled by the normal motivations that usuallyaccompany the introduction of whole new technologies.andP;  Usually the economicopportunity represented by a captive installed base is too much to resist.andO;Companies want to force users to abandon their previous investment and switchcompletely, like you have to throw out DOS to get OS/2.andP;  However, sinceArcnet's installed base is not captive, a compatible Arcnet was wiser fromeconomic and marketing standpoints.&quot;andM;Whatever the motivation behind the ArcnetPlus' introduction, the fact that itretains all of Arcnet's innerent advantages, such as efficiency at smallermessage sizes, plus adds speed and remains compatible may finally boost itpast Ethernet and Token Ring into the glamorous light.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
