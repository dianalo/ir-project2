Employers and transport companies said support for the strike haddwindled and that more workers were on the job in many areas.   In Durban, however, the Federated Chamber of Industries said thestrike had intensified around the nation's third-largest city.   Black labor unions and anti-apartheid groups called the three-dayprotest, which the government says is illegal, to oppose the2-year-old state of emergency and proposed legislation to restrictthe rights of unions to strike.   The Congress of South African Trade Unions, the largest blacklabor federation, said at least 2.5 million people were staying awayfrom jobs and schools. It called the strike the most significant todate.   General secretary Jay Naidoo denied government claims that theprotest was being sustained by intimidation.   He told reporters the strike was ``a reflection of the wide-scaleresentment and anger'' about orders issued in February that barredhis organization and other anti-apartheid groups from politicalactivity.   President P.W. Botha's government imposed the emergency June 12,1986, to combat a black uprising against apartheid, the policy ofrace discrimination that preserves privilege for South Africa's 5million whites and denies the 26 million blacks a voice in nationalaffairs.   In Lusaka, Zambia, the exile headquarters of the outlawed AfricanNational Congress guerrilla movement declared ``unequivocalsupport'' for the strike. The ANC is the main group fighting whitedomination in South Africa.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said:``The strike appears to enjoy the overwhelming support of thedisenfranchised majority in South Africa and has so far beenpeaceful.   ``We hope all parties will continue to avoid violence. The strikeunderscores the urgent need for negotiations among South Africans toreplace apartheid with a democratic constitutional order.''   The three-day strike is the largest black protest under theemergency.   A report by state-run South African Broadcasting Corp. saidparticipation declined by 45 percent Tuesday but gave no estimate ofthe number of people involved. It said in an editorial that thestrike represented the strategy of ``radical activists who want tomake South Africa ungovernable.''   Police would not comment on the scope of the protest because,they said, emergency regulations prohibit such reports. Headquartersadvised local news media to consult lawyers before publishingstories about the strike.   Authorities reported more than two dozen incidents of violenceMonday night and early Tuesday, including fire-bombings and stoningsof homes, buses and trains. Twenty-one arrests and 23 injuries werereported.   Officers shot to death a young black when a municipal police unitwas stoned, according to police spokesmen. They said seven otherblacks, including three children, were killed in shootings, a handgrenade attack and a fire-bombing.   Five of the deaths occurred near Durban. There was an unconfirmedreport of four more killings there.   The protest has aggravated a feud in the area between blackmilitants and more conservative blacks who support Zulu leaderMangosuthu Buthelezi, an opponent of strikes and otherconfrontational tactics.   The mining industry, which produces 80 percent of South Africa'sexport earnings, has been only slightly affected by the strike.   Only one gold mine reported significant absenteeism. The NationalMineworkers Union and mine owners gave conflicting reports of strikeaction at diamond and coal mines, but the union conceded effectswere limited.   All seven major auto assembly plants were closed.   According to PUTCO, a private bus company that carries 300,000black commuters daily, ridership from Johannesburg's huge blacktownship of Soweto increased from 10 percent of normal Monday to 25percent Tuesday.   It said traffic was near normal in Pretoria but remained at 10percent around Durban. The state-run South African TransportServices said rail commuter traffic had increased dramatically inmost areas.   In some black areas around Johannesburg where transport wasdisrupted, police used trucks to carry people to the nearestfunctioning bus routes.   Schools remained empty in Soweto and other black townships. Manystudents are expected to extend a scheduled vacation period thatbegins Monday by staying home the rest of this week.   The Star of Johannesburg, the country's largest daily newspaper,said in an editorial: ``There will be no winners in thisill-considered clash. The country will never know how many whostayed away did so out of political conviction, how many out of fearof retribution or simply the chance of a day off.''</TEXT></DOC>
