<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-38-1055 </DOCNO><TEXT>During the past year three new elements have been introduced into thebeam line at the Bevatron to improve patient treatment. These are thewobbler magnets, the bar-ridged filters, and the binary absorber. Thewobbler consists of a pair of orthogonal dipole magnets that sweep thebeam in concentric circles up to 30 cm in diameter. This device replacesthe lead scattering-foil system for spreading the beam laterally. Thischange allows the reduction of the beam energy from 670 MeV/amu to 585MeV/amu while maintaining the same depth of penetration in the patient.The binary absorber is a set of copper and aluminium plates of binaryincrements in thickness. Like the variable thickness water column, whichit replaces, the binary range absorber sets the residual range of theparticles as they enter the final patient compensating filtering. 6 refs.,3 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
