From Mexico to Argentina to Warsaw economists trained inthe U.S. are pushing through drastic deflationary onslaughtson old structures of state ownership and employment, onsubsidies and public patronage, and even on private assets.</LP><TEXT>   The &quot;free-market&quot; onslaught was promoted in its mostdisastrously naked guise in Bolivia, where Harvard's JeffreySachs, now on retainer in Poland and Czechoslovakia, urged ascorched-earth assault on hyperinflation. Under his directionthe state simply closed down, with huge chunks of the laborforce turned out on the streets and much significant economicactivity ceasing altogether. Inflation stopped, but so dideverything else, and soon Bolivia was urgently seeking adviceelsewhere on how to get things going again. Some Poles havetaken note of this sorry tale.   A rather more ominous story is unfolding in Brazil, which,in contrast to a Bolivian economy sustained mostly by cocacultivation, is the eighth-largest economy in the world.   In December, at the climax of a very tight race betweenthe Socialist Workers Party candidate, Lula, and the formergovernor of the state of Alagoas, Fernando Collor de Mello,victory was snatched by Mr. Collor, who had been denouncingstate corruption and who had seized some of Lula's lightningby a populist message to Brazil's millions of desperatelypoor.   No sooner had Mr. Collor taken office in March than heannounced a savage program of retrenchment and deflation. Hisplan implied one of the most abrupt attempts atcentralization of power in political memory, designed to givehim and his advisers discretionary powers over state andprivate assets undreamed of by the military regime.   Mr. Collor's deflationary plan, enacted March 16, one dayafter he took office, was to freeze all bank accounts andchange the currency. All funds over approximately $1,000would revert from the accounts in which they had been lodgedto named accounts in Brazil's Central Bank, where they wouldremain for 18 months and then be paid back to their holdersin 12 monthly installments, tying up the confiscated fundsfor more than two years.   Whom did this confiscation affect? Most bank accounts arethe purview of Brazil's less wealthy -- shopkeepers,unionized laborers, cab drivers, small businessmen, etc.Those with more cash generally invested in Brazil's&quot;overnight&quot; market in speculative bonds and currencies thatyielded rates well above inflation. Virtually all largecorporate groups held their millions in the &quot;overnight&quot;market or took their money overseas.   Mr. Collor and his economic team froze the &quot;overnight&quot; ina manner quite different from the confiscation of checkingand savings accounts. Twenty percent of the assets in a given&quot;overnight&quot; account could be reclaimed, while 80% would beconfiscated into the Central Bank for 18 months. As theBrazilian economy went into shock and prices crashed, thosewith any cash at all -- notably the 20% available to&quot;overnight&quot; account holders -- were, relatively speaking, ina position to take advantage of such opportunities as a stockmarket that lost 60% of its value, or to purchase stateenterprises for sale at 30% of their value.   Furthermore, people with substantial fortunes seized bythe government are already making arrangements to get theirmoney back, negotiating lucrative concessions and so forth.In this sense, Mr. Collor's seizure of assets has amounted toeconomic hostage-taking to consolidate his political base.The more than $100 billion now concentrated in the CentralBank fund is at the disposition of Mr. Collor, who willdecide which companies get their money back and on whatterms. This creates a tremendous potential for corruption.   Mr. Collor has also struck down barriers to foreigninvestment, permitting international investors to pick uptempting portions of Brazil's crumbling economic masonry, aswell as mineral concessions, at bargain-basement prices. Anunconfirmed report in the Jornal do Brasil recently hadJapanese investors agreeing to assume responsibility forBrazil's external debt in exchange for rights to all the goldreserves in the Amazon. Simultaneously, he has cleared awayrestrictions on imports, and this will further erode Brazil'sdomestic economy.   What has Mr. Collor's program meant in the short term?There have been big layoffs, with more than 20,000 workersidled inside a month. A large portion, up to 90% of the autoand machine capacity of the state of Sao Paulo -- theeconomic core of Brazil -- has closed down and more than10,000 government employees are soon to be laid off. Banksand businesses have failed by the dozen.   Well-publicized arrests of jewelers, and supermarket andbusiness executives charged with various economic crimes,have burnished Mr. Collor's populist image while the countryspirals into depression and its assets are thrown on theinternational auction block. Mr. Collor's popularity isrunning at 75% approval. The little guy is able to say thatat least he has the same bank balance -- $1,000 -- as therichest man in Brazil, ignoring the situation of the&quot;overnight.&quot; This popularity is terrorizing Congress intocompliance. Brazil's powerful unions, which led the assaultagainst the military, now find themselves under directthreat. Their gains had been most palpable within thestate-controlled steel and oil industries. But statecorporations -- notably Siderbras, the state steel industry-- will soon be for sale, with new and hostile ownership inview.   Mr. Collor's program amounts to a form of fascism: abruptconcentration of power in the executive, personal controlover allocation of resources in the economy, a scrim ofpopulist rhetoric.   Mr. Collor's economic strategy is reform-by-dismemberment,the model currently being essayed in Poland and nervouslyheralded earlier this week in Moscow by Mikhail Gorbachev'seconomic adviser, Leonid Abalkin. The plan outlined by Mr.Abalkin and reported in the Western press on Tuesdaysimilarly looks to shutdown of state enterprises, untrammeledforeign investment, mass unemployment, annulling of workers'rights as the only way forward. Call that fascism, too, orperhaps Market Stalinism, with &quot;market discipline&quot; imposed bydictatorial fiat, the worst of both systems.   So the newly emerging world model is not the notional&quot;free market&quot; but authoritarian capitalism as dreamed of byleaders from Santiago, Buenos Aires through London toBeijing. For Mrs. Thatcher, a response came, violently, lastweek in the form of protests against the poll tax. For theleaders in Beijing, an answer came in Tiananmen Square. Mr.Gorbachev awaits the retort of the Soviet working class. InLatin America, moving from military fascism to market fascism(or enduring both simultaneously), the fate of thesestrategies will similarly be settled in the streets.   ---   Mr. Cockburn is a columnist for The Nation and theAnderson Valley (Calif.)
