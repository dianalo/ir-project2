The Census Bureau will work with the Pentagon to count the 1.2million to 1.6 million military and civilian Defense Departmentworkers overseas, the bureau said.   The question of counting overseas military personnel has led tosharp debate in Congress, and the announcement came at the start ofa hearing on legislation to require them to be counted.   In the past, service members overseas generally have not beenincluded in census counts, which are used to apportion seats in theHouse of Representatives.   That is because census officials considered it impossible todetermine accurately in which state an individual should becounted. Many military people move often.   The Census Bureau said it will investigate ways to make thatjudgment in the 1990 census. Possibilities include listing aservice person's last state of residence for more than six months,or the state where he or she may maintain a home in this country.</TEXT></DOC>
