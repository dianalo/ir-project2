Who needs them when Chairman Ronald Allen personally reviews every nonrecurring expenditure greater than $1,000?    Such old-fashioned policies have served Delta well. It played it safe through the era of breakneck expansion that swept the industry, cautiously plodding while other airlines sped ahead. Now, a decade after the onslaught of airline deregulation, the nation's third-largest airline in terms of capacity has emerged as the strongest carrier in a battle-scarred industry, poised to profit from the weaknesses of its competitors.    While Texas Air and Pan Am went deeply into hock to expand, Delta remains the least-leveraged airline in the industry. While United battles its pilots and Eastern wars with its machinists, Delta maintains the most loyal work force in the skies. Its profit margins are the industry's fattest and its stock has been the industry's highest flier this year.    Now, Delta is finally shedding some of the stodginess that sheltered it through the tumult of deregulation. Roughly $1.4 billion in new aircraft are coming in, and hundreds of additional flights, including a number overseas, are being planned.    &quot;We've gained momentum as we've grown, and now we're like a freight train coming down the track,&quot; says W. Whitley Hawkins, senior vice president of marketing.    For all the company's newfound boldness, one long-term worry gnaws at Delta -- a major one. As a result of waiting too long to get into the business, the company's computerized reservation system today has a meager 4% to 5% share of the travel agent market, leaving United, American, Texas Air and TWA to enjoy most of the marketing benefits and fee income provided by these systems.    To push its system, Delta is offering travel agents an array of back-office software systems and a whiz-bang feature that stores video images of cruise ships, rental cars and other travel products on a hard disk. But the company admits it is stuck playing a catch-up game. &quot;We should have been in there sooner,&quot; says Mr. Allen, the chairman.    Thankfully for investors -- and unhappily for competitors -- Delta wasn't so complacent when it came to routes. Its $860 million purchase of Western Airlines in 1986 filled a huge hole in the northwest corner of Delta's route map, expanding the cities served by Delta to 156 from 106 and enlarging its fleet to 386 from 245. With a year of advance planning, the merger aroused little of the employee discontent that was visible in Northwest's purchase of Republic, for instance, and few of the gut-wrenching operational problems that occurred after Continental's acquisition of People Express.    &quot;This was unequivocally the most successful merger since deregulation,&quot; says Timothy Pettee, airline analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    Today, Delta internally projects an expansion at its hub in Cincinnati to 200 flights a day by 1992 from the current 129. Dallas-Fort Worth is slated for 300 flights a day by 1993, up from from 207. The company's main hub in Atlanta won't grow much beyond its current 400 flights a day, although the recent growth there has included service to Shannon and Dublin, Ireland.    Long a laggard in marketing, Delta is linking some of its expansion to long-term promotions. For instance, by pledging a $1 million annual fee and $10 million toward a new amusement park attraction, Delta recently grabbed Eastern's title as the official airline of Disney World.    Company officials lovingly refer to the Disney character as their &quot;golden mouse,&quot; and will only smile when asked about the profitability of the tie-in. But, as a result of it, Delta plans to increase daily service at Orlando, Fla., next year to 80 flights from the current 65. New service between Orlando and Frankfurt, West Germany, may give Delta the springboard from which to launch local service in Europe, which major U.S. airlines covet as a growth market.    Delta's expansion plans will help make its aircraft fleet -- already the youngest and most fuel-efficient in the nation -- all the more so. To expand its number of long-range aircraft for service to South Korea, Taiwan and other foreign destinations, the company plans to supplement its Lockheed L-1011 wide-bodies with late-model Airbus Industrie A-340s, Boeing 747-400s or McDonnell-Douglas MD-11s.    The company will retire by the end of this year -- much earlier than most airlines -- the last of its DC-8 and DC-10 aircraft, clearing the way for about three dozen ultramodern 757-200s and MD-88s in the next 12 months.    The company also plans to retire many of the older 727 and 737 aircraft it acquired in the Western acquisition, partly to standardize fleet maintenance but also in an effort to serve the most populous cities with bigger aircraft. Delta officials are convinced that airport overcrowding will eventually cause federal regulators to restrict landings. Thus, on service from Western's old Salt Lake City hub to New York, Delta now flies 757s, which hold 187 passengers, instead of 737s, which carry 128.    Delta can easily finance this growth because of its huge profits. The Western acquisition spread fixed costs over more aircraft seats. And Delta's revenue in 1987 totaled 12.7 cents per passenger per mile, nearly 15% above the industry average. Analysts expect record earnings for its fiscal year ended June 30 of about $500 million, nearly double the $263.7 million of a year earlier.    But in a service business, morale and productivity are the most important assets -- and by nearly all accounts, both are high at Delta. Flight attendants are considered especially critical links; indeed, Chairman Allen and other top managers recently sat through a daylong presentation on such prosaic matters as the optimum number of meal carts to maintain aboard Delta's new 757s. During this week's Democratic National Convention here, for which Delta was the official airline, some 900 unpaid employee volunteers worked at parties and hospitality suites.    Delta keeps employees happy -- and, more particularly, unions off the property -- by maintaining among the highest pay scales in the industry. American Airlines currently is fighting to preserve its so-called B scales -- the lower wage rates established for newly hired people. Delta, by contrast, voluntarily plans on Aug. 1 to eliminate the last of its two-tier wage scales.    &quot;We aren't anti-union,&quot; says Mr. Allen, who came up through the ranks of personnel himself. &quot;We're pro-people.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
