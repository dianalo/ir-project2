L. 99-335,established a new retirement system for some Federal employees. This systemconsists of a basic annuity plan, social security benefits, and a thriftsavings plan. OPM is responsible for administering the basic annuity plan,including disability benefits. Social security benefits are administeredby the Social Security Administration. The Federal Retirement Thrift InvestmentBoard will manage the thrift savings plan.Part 844 is one part of a series of interim regulations being publishedby OPM to implement the FERS Act of 1986. This part governs disabilityretirement under the new system.In brief, FERS provides disability benefits to employees with at least18 months of creditable civilian service who are unable to provide ``usefuland efficient service.'' During the first year of disability, the annuitantis entitled to 60 percent of his or her highest 3-years' average salary,minus 100 percent of the approximate social security disability benefitto which the annuitant may be entitled. After the first 12 months of disability,the benefit is 40 percent of the ``high-three'' salary, minus 60 percentof the approximate social security disability benefit, if any. Annuitantswho receive benefits under these provisions will have their benefits recomputedat age 62. These computation provisions do not apply to disability annuitantswho meet the age and service requirements for normal voluntary retirementat the time their annuities begin; these individuals will have their benefitscomputed under the appropriate formula for immediate annuities. They, likeall disability annuitants, will receive cost-of-living adjustments regardlessof their age. The computation of disability annuities is described morefully in the explanation of Subpart C of these regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. General Provisions</ITAG>Subpart A of Part 844 contains general provisions regarding disabilityretirement under FERS. Section 844.101 describes the purpose of the regulations,and andSection; 844.102 defines terms used in the regulations.Section 844.103 sets forth the conditions for eligibility for a FERS disabilityannuity. These conditions, with the exception of the requirement that theindividual must have performed 18 months of creditable civilian service,do not apply to military reserve technicians. These technicians are membersof reserve components of the armed forces working as civilians in administrativeor training positions or in supply maintenance and, as a condition of employment,they are required to maintain membership in the particular reserve componentat a specified military grade. Section 8457 of Title 5, United States Code,allows a reserve technician to receive a disability annuity under FERSif the technician is not disabled for his or her civilian duties but loses,because of a disabling condition, membership in the reserve component orthe military grade that is required for the individual to remain qualifiedfor the technician position.Section 844.105 clarifies the relationship between FERS annuities and workers'compensation benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81 of Title 5, UnitedStates Code. An individual entitled to both a FERS annuity and recurringcompensation payments must elect one benefit or the other. There are onlytwo exceptions to this rule. An individual may concurrently receive a FERSannuity based on his or her own service and compensation benefits basedon the death of another individual. Also, an individual may receive compensationbecause of his or her own disability and a FERS survivor annuity coveringthe same period of time. An individual who elects to receive compensationbenefits retains the right to elect a FERS annuity when his or her compensationpayments terminate or are reduced, provided he or she has not receiveda refund of FERS contributions. These rules conform to the current relationshipbetween annuities under the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS) andworkers' compensation benefits. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Applications for Disability Retirement</ITAG>Subpart B of Part 844 sets forth the requirements for disability retirementapplications under FERS. The law requires a FERS disability annuity tobe reduced by an approximation of any social security disability benefitto which the individual may be entitled during the first year of FERS benefits,and by a portion of the approximate social security benefit thereafter.Consequently, OPM is requiring applicants for disability retirement underFERS to apply for social security disability benefits or to provide a statementfrom the Social Security Administration that the individual is not entitledto social security disability benefits because he or she lacks insuredstatus under the Social Security Act. This requirement is needed to enableOPM to comply with 5 U.S.C. 8452(a)(2), which requires that a FERS disabilityannuity be reduced as described above. If the applicant does not applyfor social security disability benefits or does not supply proof that heor she is not entitled to such benefits, OPM cannot begin disability retirementpayments under FERS because we will not know the correct amount to pay.The Social Security Administration is, of course, responsible for evaluatingapplications for social security disability benefits. The determinationof entitlement to social security benefits is entirely distinct from thedetermination of entitlement to a FERS disability annuity. The principaldifference is that, while an individual must be disabled for his or herposition in order to be considered ``disabled'' under FERS, he or she mustbe totally disabled for any employment in order to qualify for social securitydisability benefits.Section 844.202 governs disability retirement applications filed by agencieson behalf of employees. Section 8451(a)(1)(A) of Title 5, United StatesCode, provides for agency-filed applications for disability retirement.These regulations require an agency to apply on the employee's behalf when(1) it has decided to remove the employee; (2) it has medical evidenceindicating that disease or injury is causing the employee's service deficiencyand that the employee is incapable of deciding to file a disability application;and (3) the employee has no personal representative, guardian, or familymember who is willing to apply on the employee's behalf. OPM will not acton the application until it receives notice that the employee has beenseparated. We believe applying these strict criteria to agency-filed applicationswill ensure that the disability retirement program will be used appropriatelyand not in place of the normal procedures for separating an employee whoseperformance or conduct is unsatisfactory.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Computation of Disability Retirement Annuities</ITAG>Subpart C of Part 844 sets forth rules concerning the computation of disabilityannuities. Disability annuities being on the day after the employee separatesor pay ceases and the employee meets the requirements for title to an annuity,but in no case may an annuity begin before January 1, 1987, the effectivedate of FERS. For the first 12 months that a disability annuity is payable,the annuity is equal to 60 percent of the annuitant's highest 3-years'average pay. At the end of 12 months, the annuity becomes 40 percent ofthe retiree's ``high-three'' salary. During the first 12 months, if theretiree is also entitled to social security disability benefits, his orher annuity under FERS is reduced by the entire amount of the individual's``assumed'' social security disability benefit, and by 60 percent of the``assumed'' social security benefit after the first 12 months. The reductionapplies only in months for which the individual is entitled to social securitydisability benefits. This ``assumed'' amount is equal to the amount ofthe social security benefit that would have been payable if the benefithad begun with the month in which the FERS disability annuity began (orwas reinstated under Subpart D), increased by any FERS cost-of-living adjustmentsthat were effective on and after the commencing date of the FERS annuity.This means that the 5-month waiting period required by the Social SecurityAct between the onset of the disabling condition and the commencement ofbenefit payments will be ignored in computing the assumed social securitydisability benefit.When a disability annuitant reaches age 62, his or her annuity is redeterminedas set forth in andSection; 844.303. A normal retirement annuity is computedwith respect to the annuitant, including credit for the period during whichthe disability annuity was payable, and adjusting the ``high-three'' averagesalary by FERS cost-of-living adjustments that were effective during theperiod or periods the disability annuity was payable. This redeterminedannuity is compared to the disability annuity that has been reduced bythe appropriate portion (i.e., either 100 percent or 60 percent) of theassumed social security disability benefit, and the lesser of the two amountsis payable beginning on the annuitant's 62nd birthday. As required by 5U.S.C. 8452(b)(3), andSection; 844.303(b)(1) specifies that, if the annuitantreaches 62 during the first year of disability, the reduced disabilityannuity used in this comparison cannot be greater than the reduced disabilityannuity that would be payable after the first 12 months of disability.Finally, as provided in andSection; 844.303(b)(3), if the annuitant is notentitled to social security disability benefits and, therefore, his orher FERS disability annuity is not being reduced, it must be assumed forthe sake of the redetermination at age 62 that the FERS annuity <T3>is</T3> being reduced by the assumed social security disability benefit.If this annuity, with the reduction by the appropriate portion of the hypotheticalsocial security disability benefit, is less than the redetermined annuitydescribed at the beginning of this paragraph, this hypothetically reduceddisability annuity is the amount that will actually be payable on and afterthe annuitant's 62nd birthday. Consequently, it is possible for a disabilityannuitant to experience a substantial reduction in income at age 62, particularlyif the annuitant has no entitlement to social security benefits.Section 844.304 provides that, regardless of any other provision, a disabilityannuity, after any social security offset has been applied, may not beless than a normal voluntary retirement annuity based on the annuitant'sactual service (excluding any reduction for age).Section 844.305 provides that a disability annuity will be computed underthe rules for computing nondisability annuities if the annuity commencesor is reinstated on or after the annuitant satisfies the age and servicerequirements for immediate voluntary retirement or reaches age 62.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Termination of Disability Annuities </ITAG>Subpart D of Part 844 sets forth the conditions under which disabilityannuities are terminated and resumed or reinstated. Section 844.401 governstermination of a disability annuity because of the annuitant's recovery.OPM will also terminate the annuity if the annuitant refuses to cooperatewith OPM's requests for information needed to evaluate his or her continuingentitlement to benefits. Annuity payments will be resumed if and when theindividual provides the requested information demonstrating that he orshe is still disabled.Section 844.402 provides for terminating a disability annuity when theannuitant's earning capacity has been restored. Under 5 U.S.C. 8455(a)(2),the annuity of a disability annuitant under age 60 stops if his or herearning capacity is restored. By law, earning capacity is considered tobe restored if ``income of the annuitant from wages or self-employmentor both'' during a calendar year equals at least 80 percent of the ``currentrate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.'' Thedisability annuity stops on the next June 30, or on reemployment in Federalservice, whichever is earlier. These interim regulations define the rateof basic pay of the position from which the annuitant retired on disability,provide the means of updating the rate for comparison to income earnedin future years, and define the term ``income from wages or self-employmentor both'' for earning capacity determination purposes. A. Current Rate of Pay of the Position Occupied Immediately Before RetirementBasic pay is all pay subject to FERS withholdings and is defined by 5 U.S.C.8401(4). It includes, for example, administratively uncontrollable overtimepremium pay for firefighters and law enforcement officers and night shiftdifferential for Federal Wage System employees. Generally, the ``current rate of pay of the position occupied immediatelybefore retirement'' is the rate of basic pay, as of December 31 of theyear for which earning capacity is being determined, for the grade andstep of the position the employee held on the date of separation from theemploying agency. In determing the rate of pay of the position occupiedimmediately before retirement, the employing agency, at the time the disabilityretirement application is approved, will first determine the total rateof basic pay for the position held on the date of separation for retirement.This will include any additional basic pay authorized on that date forwhich FERS deductions are made (subject to the statutory limitation onthe premium pay rate (the GS-10, step 1 rate) under 5 U.S.C. 5545(c) (1)and (2)). The total amount of the rate of basic pay on the date of separationwill then be converted into a grade and step under the provisions of andSection;844.402(b).B. Disability Annuitants Whose Basic Pay Rates Do Not Equate to a Gradeand Step in Their Pay Schedule (1) <T3>Senior Executive Service employees and Merit Pay System employees.</T3>For some employees, such as those in the Senior Executive Serviceor the Merit Pay System, basic pay rates usually do not equate to a gradeand step in their pay schedule. In these cases, the regulations simplyput the rate of pay at retirement at the next higher step if it falls betweensteps (see andSection; 844.402(b)(2)). Then the grade and step will be updatedthe same way as for other employees. The grade and step OPM sets for thispurpose will be used only in deciding whether an annuitant's earning capacityis restored.(2) <T3>Employees on retained pay. </T3>Employees who have a retained pay ratemay also have a rate of pay that does not equate to a specific grade andstep. While under pay retention, the employee legally has the grade ofthe actual position occupied, but, based on a formula included in the law,receives a rate of pay above the highest rate for the grade of that position.Taking into account the fact that this rate may fall under more than onegrade in the pay schedule, the regulations set the grade in these casesat the grade nearest the actual grade of the position held, for purposesof determining the rate of pay of the position occupied immediately beforeretirement. When the grade has been set, the step then is set at the stepabove the employee's rate of basic pay, unless it exactly matches the ratefor a step in that grade. For example, using General Schedules rates in effect in 1986, OPM wouldset the grade and step of an employee retiring in 1986 from a GS-5 positionwith retained pay of $27,105 at GS-9, step 9. (GS-9 is the closest gradeto the employee's position within which the employee's retained rate falls.Step 9, at $27,620, is the step above the retained rate of pay.) In futureyears, OPM can compare the retiree's income to the current rate of payfor GS-9, step 9, for any calendar year. (3) <T3>Employees on special pay rates. </T3>Employees who retire from positionscovered by special pay rates authorized under 5 U.S.C. 5303 are treatedlike employees on retained pay. In fixing the rate of pay at retirement,one must use the grade of the position occupied, unless the employee'sactual rate of basic pay exceeds the highest rate payable for his or hergrade. In such a case, the grade will be set at the next highest gradewithin which the actual rate of pay falls. The step will be set at thelowest step in that grade that equals or exceeds the employee's actualrate of basic pay. (See andSection; 844.403(b)(2)).C. Updating the Rate of Pay of the Position Occupied Immediately BeforeRetirementOnce the grade and step set as ``the rate of pay of the position occupiedimmediately before retirement'' is determined at the time the employeeretires on disability, the regulations state that OPM will determine therate in effect on December 31 of each future year for the designated gradeand step. General pay increases, such as percentage adjustments in theGeneral Schedule, are included to update the rate of pay. General increasesin local wage grade pay schedules are also included. These two kinds ofincreases cover the vast majority of cases. Potential increases based onlength of service and quality of performance or reclassification of position(such as promotions or within-grade increases), which the employee mayhave received if he or she had not retired but had continued working, arenot included.D. Income for Earning Capacity Purposes: General ConceptBecause disability retirement is not a permanent retirement benefit forindividuals under age 60, but protects the individual against the lossof earning capacity because of a disabling medical condition, the regulationsbase earning capacity determinations on the annuitant's ability to earnincome from his or her personal work efforts actually rendered in the openlabor market despite the disability (see andSection; 844.402(c)). Consequentlyfor determining restoration of earning capacity, ``income'' is calculatedseparately from ``income'' for Federal income tax or FICA (Federal InsuranceContributions Act) tax purposes. For example, while unearned income suchas inheritances and interest on personal savings accounts are part of incomefor tax purposes, these kinds of income do not reflect an individual'searning capacity and, therefore, are not considered income for purposesof these regulations. Also, the use of either the Federal income tax orFICA tax law definitions of wages and net earnings provides numerous opportunitiesto adjust income that, while permitted under those laws, are not validfor determining whether the disability annuitant has demonstrated an abilityto earn income.E. Definition of ``income''``Income,'' for purposes of earning capacity, is the total of the grossamount of wages earned as an employee from one or more employers and earningsfrom self-employment during the calendar year for which the earning capacitydetermination is being made (see andSection; 844.442(c)). Income is countedin the calendar year in which it is earned, even if receipt is deferred.In calculating an annuitant's total income, the regulations provide thatlosses in one self-employment endeavor do not offset income from anothersource, either wages earned from working in an employee/employer relationshipor net earnings from another self-employed business (see andSection; 844.442(c)).If an annuitant has demonstrated an ability to earn a salary from an employerand/or net earnings from one business that are equal to or greater thanthe 80-percent statutory limitation, that fact is not diminished by thefailure to turn a profit while also engaged in a separate business.<ITAG tagnum="85">V. Resumption and Reinstatement of Terminated Disability Annuities</ITAG>Under the provisions governing reemployment of FERS annuitants in 5 U.S.C.8468, if a disability annuitant is reemployed in any position in the FederalGovernment, his or her annuity terminates on the date of reemployment.To facilitate the employment of disability annuitants without prejudiceto their benefits, if the reemployment ends within 12 months, OPM willresume the disability annuity automatically without requiring additionalmedical documentation. In these cases, the annuity will be resumed at therate that would have been payable if the annuity had not been terminated.Usually this will be 40 percent of average pay unless the resumption occursbefore the end of the 12th month after the annuity commenced.This differs from the practice in cases where a disability annuity wasterminated because of a medical finding of recovery or because the annuitant'searning capacity was restored. In these cases, if OPM makes a medical findingthat the disability has recurred or determines that the individual hasagain lost his or her earning capacity, the annuity will be reinstatedat the rate of 60 percent of average salary for the first 12 months afterreinstatement. If the individual is also entitled to social security disabilitybenefits during this period, the benefit is offset by 100 percent of theassumed social security disability benefit. At the end of the first 12months after reinstatement, the annuity equals 40 percent of average pay,minus 60 percent of the assumed social security disability benefit if theindividual is also entitled to a social security disability benefit. Reinstatementtakes effect on the date of medical documentation showing that the disabilityhas recurred or on January 1 of the year following the year in which earningcapacity again fell below 80 percent of the current rate of basic pay ofthe position from which the individual retired.It is important to distinguish between resumption and reinstatement ofa disability annuity as described in the two preceding paragraphs. Section8452(a)(1)(A)(i) of Title 5, United States Code, requires the annuity tobe reinstated at the higher rate (60 percent of average pay) for 12 monthswhen reinstatement follows a medical finding by OPM that the annuitantrecovered from his or her disability and a subsequent finding that thedisability recurred. No such findings will have been made under the circumstancesset forth in andSection; 844.405(a) (i.e., resumption of a disability annuitythat was terminated because of Federal reemployment that ends within 12months). The annuity will have been terminated because all FERS annuitiesmust terminate on Federal reemployment, and not because of a medical findingthat the individual has recovered. The annuity will have been resumed automatically,based on termination of the reemployment within 12 months, and not on anymedical finding that the disability has recurred. Under 5 U.S.C. 8452(a)(1)(A)(i),these cases can be treated differently from cases in which the annuitymust be reinstated at the 60 percent rate because a new medical findingof disability has been made.The need for a provision like andSection; 844.405(a) is clear. It is importantto encourage those disability annuitants who are able and motivated toseek reemployment in the Federal Government to do so without first requiringa medical finding by OPM that the individual has recovered from his orher disability. Moreover, if the individual becomes reemployed and findswithin a reasonable period (12 months) that he or she is unable to continueworking, we believe the disability annuity should be resumed without question.Requiring the individual to submit new medical documentation at his orher own expense demonstrating that he or she has again become disabledbefore the annuity can be restored would discourage many individuals fromseeking reemployment in the first place. At the same time, it would beunreasonable to reinstate the annuity at the higher rate for 12 monthsin these cases, since this would create a serious potential for abuse.It would be fairly simple for a disability annuitant to obtain reemploymentin any Federal job (not necessarily resembling the position from whichhe or she retired) and then to resign shortly thereafter in order to beginanother 12-month period of annuity payments at the higher (60 percent)rate. In order to preclude this possibility, the annuity will be automaticallyresumed at the lower rate in these cases, unless the reemployment endswithin 12 months after the disability annuity commenced.An individual in these circumstances will, however, retain the option ofpresenting medical evidence, at the end of the Federal reemployment, whichdemonstrates that he or she has again become disabled. If OPM makes a newfinding of disability based on this documentation, the individual willbe entitled to have the disability annuity reinstated at the 60 percentrate for 12 months, at the end of which the annuity will drop back to 40percent of average pay. In this way, the individual's right to have theannuity reinstated at the higher rate will be protected, provided he orshe accepts the burden of proving that he or she has again become disabled.Waiver of Notice of Proposed Rulemaking and 30-day Delay of Effective DateUnder 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and (d)(3), I find that good cause exists forwaiving the general notice of proposed rulemaking and for making theseregulations effective in less than 30 days. OPM must issue regulationsto implement an entire new retirement system that was effective on January1, 1987. There is an urgent need for firm rules on disability retirementto deal with applications from employees who were automatically coveredby FERS on January 1, 1987. In addition, clear rules must be in place toallow preparation of materials and worldwide distribution of them to employeeswho are eligible to elect FERS coverage during the ``open season'' betweenJuly 1 and December 31, 1987. These tasks, along with the need to prepare,publish, and distribute essential forms and informational materials, makethe publication of proposed rules impracticable.E.O. 12291, Federal RegulationI have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.Regulatory Flexibility Act  I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities because the regulation will affectonly disability retirement benefits for Federal employees.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 844  </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Disability benefits, Firefighters,Government employees, Income taxes, Law enforcement officers, Pensions,Retirement.  <ITAG tagnum="20">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director.  </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is amending Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, to adda new Part 844 to read as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 844_FEDERAL EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT SYSTEM_DISABILITY RETIREMENT </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.101 Purpose.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.102 Definitions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.103 Eligibility.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.104 Administrative review of OPM decisions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.105 Relationship to workers' compensation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Applications for Disability Retirement  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.201 General requirements.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.202 Agency-filed disability retirement applications.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.203 Supporting documentation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Computation of Disability Annuity  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.301 Commencing date of a disability annuity.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.302 Computation of disability annuity before age 62.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.303 Redetermination of disability annuity at age 62.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.304 Minimum disability annuity.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.305 Computation of disability annuity for those otherwise eligibleto retire.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart D_Termination and Reinstatement of Disability Annuity  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.401 Recovery from disability.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.402 Restoration of earning capacity.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.403 Reemployment of disability annuitants.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.404 Annuity rights after a disability annuity terminates.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">844.405 Resumption and reinstatement of disability annuity.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 8461.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General Provisions  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;844.101  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.  </ITAG>This part establishes the requirements under the Federal Employees' RetirementSystem (FERS) for eligibility to receive a disability annuity, applicationprocedures for disability annuities, rules for computing a disability annuity,and the conditions and procedures under which a disability annuity is terminatedand reinstated.  <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;844.102  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.  </ITAG>In this part_  ``Accommodation'' means a reasonable adjustment made to an employee's jobor work environment that enables the employee to perform the duties ofthe position.
