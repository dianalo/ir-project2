ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Most Americans probably don't remember it, but awar broke out on Aug. 25, 1982.   It was a confrontation involving four huge U.S. corporationsthat ended with Bendix Corp., initially the aggressor, gettingswallowed up and disappearing under the wing of Allied Corp.   It may seem remote and insignificant now. But this fight fromthe early 1980s helped shape a decade of wild and expensivetakeover battles that peaked in 1988 with the $25 billion purchaseof RJR Nabisco Inc. and stumbled just two months ago with thecollapse of a planned $6.75 billion buyout of UAL Corp.   Throughout the decade, takeovers had a constant companion:controversy. Businessmen, economists and lawmakers debated whethertakeovers were good or bad for companies, employees and the country.   The Bendix war introduced the concept of the hostile takeoverbid to many Americans. Led by high-profile chairman William Agee,Bendix fired the first shot that August with an unwanted bid forMartin Marietta Corp.   Martin Marietta fought back, trying to gobble up Bendix in whatbecame known as the ``Pac-Man'' defense, and United TechnologiesCorp. and Allied Corp. also entered the fray.   By the time the battle ended in January 1983, Bendix hadself-destructed and become part of Allied in a $2 billion buyoutand both Martin Marietta and Allied were deeply in debt.   Then, in 1985, just a little over two years after acquiringBendix, Allied merged with Signal Cos. Inc. in a $4.9 billion deal.   As the decade progressed, buyouts got bigger and bigger. In1988, they reached their zenith with the buyout of RJR Nabisco bythe investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. Also during theyear, Philip Morris Cos. Inc. bought Kraft Inc. for $12.9 billionand Grand Metropolitan PLC acquiredPillsbury Co. for $5.68 billion.   Even as the stakes were raised, one deal was launched that wouldbegin to push the pendulum of merger mania back the other way. The$6.6 billion purchase of Federated Department Stores Inc. byCanada's Campeau Corp. in April 1988, helped send takeovers totheir nadir 18 months later.   Junk bonds, the breakfast of all takeover champions, proved toohard for investors to swallow in the Campeau deal.   Thehigh-risk, high-yield bonds had made it possible for ``justabout anybody on the block'' to get some action going, said JeromeE. Hass, a professor of managerial economics and finance at CornellUniversity's Johnson Graduate School of Management.   But some big dealmakers _ Campeau chief among them _ took onmore debt than they could handle and could not make their interestpayments. After Campeau's troubles became known, the junk-bondmarket plunged and suddenly, it seemed next to impossible to findmoney for a deal.   No one learned that lesson harder than UAL Corp. this fall.   Pilots and senior managers of UAL couldn't get enough banks tofinance their planned buyout of the parent of United Airlines andthe deal collapsed on Oct. 13, dragging the stock market down withit. News of the failed buyout sent the Dow Jones industrial averageplummeting 190 points.   Takeovers were a factor in some of Wall Street's best and worstperformances during the 1980s. Speculation about buyouts helpedpropel the market to record highs but the possibility that thetakeover boom was ending contributed to the Oct. 19, 1987 crash andthe market's most recent slide.   Amid the turmoil, the RJR Nabisco deal continued to shine, eventhough the record buyout was accomplished with $4 billion of junkbonds. Cash from the company's food and tobacco business wasexpected to easily service its massive debt load.   But even with such bright spots as RJR Nabisco, all the takeoverbattles, soaring debt levels and market gyrations unsettled manyAmericans.   Workers whose companies were taken over found themselves facinglayoffs as new owners cut costs. Local officials worried about theeffect takeovers would have on their communities. Congressmenwarned that companies saddled with massive interest payments couldfail, jeopardizing the solvency of banks that helped finance thedeals.   Other critics, citing the profits many investors made fromtakeovers, said there was just too much greed.   But supporters of the takeover process _ including the biddersthemselves _ said buyouts improved the efficiency of companiesbecause unnecessary jobs and expenses were eliminated. That madethe firms more profitable and able to expand, and that was good forthe economy, they said.   Hass noted that ``companies that were potential targets havecleaned up their act'' by restructuring and paring costs. Takeoversindirectly helped those firms, he said.   The negative atmosphere surrounding takeovers spawned new statelaws seeking to shield companies, their employees and communitiesfrom becoming the pawns of takeover strategists.   Suitors tried to dismantle the statutes, but in 1987, the U.S.Supreme Court ruled the states had the right to pass laws curbinghostile takeovers.   The new statutes gave companies more muscle to fight unwantedbids. In Delaware, where more than half the Fortune 500 companiesare incorporated, a new law allowed Polaroid Corp. to use anemployee stock ownership plan and other devices to defeat a hostilebid by Shamrock Holdings Inc.   State courts also became deeply involved in shaping takeover lawand helped determine the outcome of several major fights.   Delaware courts stopped Paramount Communications Inc.'s hostilebid for Time Inc., allowing Time and Warner Communications Inc. toproceed with a $14 billion merger.   Legal obstacles helped persuade strategists including T. BoonePickens Jr. and Asher Edelman to give up hostile takeovers. Theysaid the process had become too complicated and too expensive, andthey turned their attention toward overseas targets _ Europe forEdelman, and Japan for Pickens.   For dealmakers of the future, caution may be in greater supplythan junk bonds.   Said Hass, ``Only mergers or acquisitions that make economicsense are going to prevail.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
