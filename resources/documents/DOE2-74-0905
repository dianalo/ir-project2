Yet, major advances in design methodologieshave occurred in other branches of engineering. Is creative design inmining a myth only? Are we deluding ourselves when we talk about innovativemining design of today? Are most design experts often unaware of theirown decision-making processes? This paper explores the methodology ofcreative engineering design as a new recognized discipline. 10 refs.,1 fig.</TEXT></DOC>
