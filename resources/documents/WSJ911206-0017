Allan Hubbard, director of the council, owns 1,000 sharesof PSI Resources Inc., a Plainfield, Ind., holding companythat owns PSI Energy Inc., one of the biggest emitters ofsulfur dioxide in the nation. At the price quoted for PSIResources shares in late New York Stock Exchange trading, Mr.Hubbard's stake has a value of $17,625.</LP><TEXT>   At the mid-October interagency meeting at which Mr.Hubbard presided, officials decided to modify toughemissions-monitoring requirements that the EnvironmentalProtection Agency staff had drafted, a change that PSI andmany other utilities had been pushing for.   Federal officials typically are required to refrain fromparticipating in decisions affecting companies in which theyhave direct financial interests. But the council's chairman,Vice President Dan Quayle, has granted Mr. Hubbard a waiverfrom these requirements on the grounds that his PSI holdingsand other financial interests aren't substantial enough &quot;tobe deemed likely to affect the integrity&quot; of his governmentservice.   Still, disclosure of Mr. Hubbard's participation in rulesaffecting PSI drew criticism from congressional Democrats andenvironmental groups, who have long contended that thecouncil's review of Clean Air Act rules amounts to an effortto weaken the law. The council helps settle interagencydisputes before federal agencies issue regulations and worksto ensure that the rules aren't excessively burdensome onindustry.   The disclosure also follows a report that Mr. Hubbard isthe half-owner of World Wide Chemical Inc., achemical-processing company in Indianapolis that also couldbe affected by clean air rules.   &quot;There's absolutely no way to justify this,&quot; said Sen. AlGore (D., Tenn.). &quot;It doesn't look good. It doesn't soundgood. It just isn't smart to grant a waiver that preventsconflict-of-interest laws from preventing conflicts ofinterest.&quot; Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.) said, &quot;Mr.Hubbard's participation in matters affecting companies inwhich he has financial interest is a matter of graveconcern.&quot;   A spokesman for Mr. Hubbard, however, denied that the PSIstock presents any conflict of interest or appearance ofconflict, contending that the holdings were fully disclosedwhen he joined the government and that they &quot;are very smallrelative to his net worth.&quot;   The rules at issue involve how utilities must estimatetheir emissions of sulfur dioxide when theiremissions-monitoring equipment is out of service for repairsor other reasons. The EPA staff had sought to make thecompanies assume high emission rates when their equipmentisn't functioning, creating an incentive to keep theirmonitors running whenever possible. In a letter to the EPA inAugust, PSI contended that such an approach would result inan inaccurate count of emissions nationwide.   &quot;The change is more in keeping with a fair approach to theClean Air Act,&quot; said Robert Norris, a PSI spokesman. &quot;Therule as initially proposed would have had a punitive effecton our company.&quot;   David Hawkins, a senior attorney for the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, disagreed, saying &quot;this change introduces afatal flaw&quot; into the monitoring system that will encourageutilities to turn off their equipment when emissions arehighest. He said it &quot;will let them report emissions that canbe lower than what their actual emissions are, with theresult that more goes into the environment than what they'reheld accountable for.&quot;   William Rosenberg, assistant EPA administrator for air andradiation, said the monitoring rule &quot;was modified in a waythat would achieve the same environmental benefits as the EPAproposals.&quot;   The rule changes were ultimately accepted by EPA officialsand others at the October meeting as part of a broadercompromise reached on a package of rules governing acid rain.In addition to staff members from the council, officials fromthe EPA, the Energy Department, the White House budget officeand the Council of Economic Advisers also attended.   The EPA subsequently proposed the acid rain packagecontaining the rule changes and is seeking public comment.</TEXT></DOC>
