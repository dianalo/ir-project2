The death of the energy boomhas weakened Texas' energy banks. The banks' financial information wasderived from their Annual Reports, information published in newspapersand periodicals, and, in some cases, the writer's conversations withother bankers. Crude oil and refined-product price histories were obtainedfrom Platt's Oil Price Handbooks for 1945-1985 and from Platt's Oil Gram,a daily newspaper, in 1986. Statistics on the refining and oil fieldservice industries are American Petroleum Institute data and counts byHughes Tool Company and the Society of Exploration Geophysicists, publishedin the Oil and Gas Journal. The analysis begins with an overview of theenergy-lending problem, first recognized in 1982 when Penn Square Bankin Oklahoma City was closed by bank regulators. Why, and to what extent,the Texas energy banks committed themselves to the oil industry in thoseyears, as well as the effects of the oil industry's four-and-one-halfyear decline on the banks' financial strength is detailed. How banksstructured loans to various energy borrowers and why these borrowerslost their ability to service their debts is analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
