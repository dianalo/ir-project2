Meanwhile, the justices made it easier for workers to provetheir bosses were guilty of illegal discrimination and barredstates from placing sweeping regulations on professional groupsthat solicit contributions for charities.   By a 5-3 vote, the Supreme Court ruled that non-union employeesof private employers may not be forced to pay the equivalent ofunion dues if some of that money is used for activities notdirectly related to collective bargaining.   The high court said that using compulsory fees paid by non-unionemployees under so-called ``agency shop'' contracts to pursue aunion's political goals violates federal labor law.   Thousands of labor contracts require workers who choose not tojoin the unions representing them to pay the same amount in fees asmembers pay in dues.   Although federal labor law allows states to pass``right-to-work'' laws barring such agency-fee requirements, 29states representing two-thirds of the nation's population havechosen not to pass such laws.   In those states, over 90 percent of the collective bargainingagreements to which a key federal labor law applies carryagency-fee requirements.   The justices were told that 6 million workers are covered bysuch contracts.   The high court in 1977 had ruled that public employees _ thosewho work for some governmental entity _ have the right to withholdthat portion of their non-member union fees used by the union foractivities not directly related to collective bargaining.   On Wednesday, the court ruled that employees of privateemployers have the same right.   The ruling could deprive many unions of significant portions oftheir revenue. And it likely will require many unions to establishcostly bookkeeping procedures to assure that agency fees paid bynon-members are not used for anything but collective bargaining.   Wednesday's ruling involved 20 employees of American Telephone andamp;Telegraph Co. in Maryland who sued the Communications Workers ofAmerica union in 1976. The employees contended that they shouldhave the right to withhold a portion of their non-member fees toavoid the involuntary subsidizing of political positions with whichthey did not agree.   They said the union's use of their money for such purposesviolated their constitutional rights and the National LaborRelations Act of 1935.   Unions spend millions of dollars each year in lobbying forlegislation and engaging in other political activities. Unions mostoften support Democratic candidates.   A federal judge had ruled that the Communications Workers unionmust refund that portion of the agency fees spent for purposesother than collective bargaining, and the ruling was upheld by the4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.   But the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals had ruled againstnon-union employees in a similar dispute involvig the United AutoWorkers.   The Reagan administration, splitting with some of itsconservative supporters, urged the justices to rule against thenon-union employees.   In other business-related decisions Wednesday, the Supreme Court:   _Expanded the way employees can use statistical evidence toprove bias. Voting 8-0, the justices said that Clara Watson, aformer bank employee in Fort Worth, Texas, improperly was barredfrom using statistics in trying to prove she was discriminatedagainst because she is black.   The lawsuit against Fort Worth Bank andamp; Trust, now known as MBankEast, was ordered returned to a federal trial court.   _Ruled states should not be allowed to place sweeping, strictregulations on professional, for-profit organizations that solicitcontributions for charities. The justices, by a 7-2 vote, said thata North Carolina law that imposed such regulations violatedfree-speech rights.   Numerous charitable groups such as the National Federation ofthe Blind, the American Red Cross and the Easter Seal Society hadurged the court to disallow North Carolina's regulations forfundraising. They said the restrictions severely threatenedcharities' ability to raise money.</TEXT></DOC>
