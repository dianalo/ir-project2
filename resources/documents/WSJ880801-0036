The ability to clone such receptors, the part of a cell where substances bind and become biologically active, could be useful in creating therapeutics to control excess amounts of IL-1. Large amounts of the immune system protein have been linked to arthritis and diabetes.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, the biotechnology concern's shares closed at $16.25, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
