(Project Orange), to amend a conditionalauthorization to import natural gas from Canada granted by the EconomicRegulatory Administration (ERA) on October 17, 1988, in DOE/ERA Opinionand Order No. 274 (Order 274). Project Orange is seeking interim authorityto import interruptible supplies of gas through existing pipeline facilitiesuntil new facilities to accommodate firm deliveries are built.Order 274 was originally issued in ERA Docket No. 88-01-NG to G.A.S. OrangeDevelopment, Inc. (1 ERA Para. 70,815). Subsequently, on December 19, 1988,the ERA approved the transfer of this conditional authority to ProjectOrange (unnumbered and unpublished order). Order 274 addressed variousnon-environmental issues and made initial findings regarding these issues.As stated in Order 274, the conditional determination is to be reconsideredafter completion of the environmental review of impacts associated withconstruction and operation of certain pipeline facilities proposed by TennesseeGas Pipeline Company (Tennessee) to provide firm transportation servicefor the gas from the international border near Niagara Falls, New York.On January 6, 1989, the authority to regulate natural gas imports and exportswas transferred from the ERA to FE. DOE Delegation Order No. 0204-127 specifiesthe transferred functions (54 FR 11436, March 20, 1989).The application is filed under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA) andDOE Delegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127.

(Noranda), over a term of 20 years beginning on the dateof the initial delivery. The gas will be imported to fuel a new cogenerationfacility to be built in Syracuse, New York. In the original January 5,1988, import application, the commercial operation date of the cogenerationplant and the date on which initial deliveries would take place was projectedto be June 30, 1990. The commercial operation date is now scheduled forMarch 1, 1991. The import authorization is conditioned upon completionof the environmental review of certain proposed facilities. The FederalEnergy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has the lead in preparing the environmentalanalysis of the additional transmission facilities proposed by Tennesseeto increase its system capacity. The capacity increase is necessary totransport the gas for Project Orange on a firm daily basis from NiagaraFalls to a proposed interconnection with Project Orange south of Syracuse(FERC Docket No. 88-171-000). After the FERC has completed its environmentalanalysis and the DOE reviews it and makes its own environmental determination,DOE would issue a final opinion and order.Project Orange indicates in its present filing before FE that there isa possibility that Tennessee's pipeline expansion may not be accomplishedbefore the cogeneration plant comes on line, due to the uncertainties ofwhen the FERC's environmental review will be completed and the actual timingof construction. Therefore, it has arranged interruptible transportationon existing Tennessee pipeline facilities for the gas purchased from Noranda.Project Orange requests that Order 274 be amended to authorize the importantof volumes from Noranda utilizing Tennessee's existing mainline capacityuntil the interruptible service can be converted to firm service when theexpansion of Tennessee's pipeline facilities takes place.Under the transportation agreement, Tennessee will deliver 24,000 Dth perday to Project Orange. The only pipeline construction necessary for theinterruptible transportation would be the installation of tie-in facilitiesat the point where Tennessee's No. 200 mainline and the 7-miles, 12-inchdelivery pipeline extending from the cogeneration plant intersect.The ERA preliminarily determined in issuing Order 274 that the import arrangementis competitive and consistent with the DOE natural gas import policy guildelines(49 FR 6684, February 22, 1984), that there is a demonstrated need forthe gas, and that proven reserves owned or controlled by Noranda wouldprovide a secure supply over the term of the requested authorization. Althoughthe commodity pricing provisions of the gas sales agreement depart fromcustomary provisions permitting fluctuations in response to market changes,the ERA noted that the agreement results from arm's length negotiationsand reflects a balancing of the parties' respective commercial interest.A single up-front payment for gas was negotiated for in order to securea long-term supply commitment and, also, the importer was given the flexibilityto request that Noranda market, either in Canada or in the United States,up to 4.5 million MMBtu each year (or 50 percent of the annual contractquantity) and refund the net proceeds to the importer. In addition, thesales agreement contains an arbitration procedure which either party caninitiate.At the time Order 274 was issued, the lump sum payment was set at $72.9million. Project Orange filed with its application to amend Order 274 aJanuary 11, 1989, amendment to the gas purchase contract with Noranda whichrevised the lump sum payment amount to $77.6 million. This payment equatesto about $0.65/Mcf if the total contract volume is taken over the 20-yearterm. In addition to the lump sum payment, a fee will be paid to Norandato cover gathering and processing costs. The fee initially would be setat $0.30/MMBtu and would be adjusted annually thereafter for inflation.The present application will be reviewed under section 3 of the NGA, theauthority contained in DOE Delegation Order Nos. 0204-111 and 0204-127,and the DOE's policy guidelines. Under the guidelines, the competitivenessof an import in the markets served is the primary consideration in determiningwhether it is in the public interest. Based on the application, the onlychange in the original proposal conditionally approved by the ERA in Order274 would be the possible transportation of the gas on an interruptiblebasis utilizing pipeline facilities currently in place. The contractualterms under which the gas would be supplied are substantially the sameand the quantity imported would not change. Absent a protest, it is expectedthat the ERA's initial evaluation that the import would provide a needed,secure, and competitive supply of gas would remain valid for Project Orange'spresent application.All parties should be aware that if approved, the authorization would betemporary and limited to imported gas that is delivered through existingtransmission facilities to the cogeneration facility once it is operational.The authority would expire when a final opinion and order is issued inthis proceeding after completion of the enviornmental review of Tennessee'sproposed pipeline facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance</ITAG>Under Section D of the DOE guidelines for compliance with the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 42 U.S.C. 4321, <T3>et seq., </T3>actions that grant or deny import authorizations whereno new gas transmission facilities are needed but where new ancillary facilitiesare to be constructed, such as a cogeneration facility, would normallyrequire the preparation of an environmental assessment (EA), because theyinvolve ``minor new construction'' (54 FR 12474, March 27, 1989). However,we believe that preparation of an EA to approve or disapprove Project Orange'sapplication to amend Order 247 is unnecessary, and compliance with NEPAfor the proposed action can be acheived by invoking two categorical exclusionsin the DOE NEPA guidelines (52 FR 47622, December 15, 1987).The environmental impacts of constructing and operating new cogenerationfacilities have been addressed on numerous occasions by the ERA in conjunctionwith processing exemption petitions under the Powerplant and IndustrialFuel Use Act (FUA) (10 U.S.C. 3801 <T3>et. seq, </T3>as amended), and as a result, such actions have beengranted a categorical exclusion from further NEPA review (52 FR 47670,December 15, 1987). The cogeneration facilities to be constructed in connectionwith these import applications are identical to those facilities coveredby the categorical exclusion for FUA actions. Therefore, it is an appropriateapplication of another categorical exclusion contained in the DOE guidelinesfor ``actions that are substantially the same as other actions for whichthe environmental effects have already been assessed in a NEPA documentand determined by DOE to be clearly insignificant and where such assessmentis currently valid'' (52 FR 47668, December 15, 1987) to extend the FUAcategorical exclusion for cogeneration facilities to the grant of an authorizationto imprt natural gas under the NGA which results in the construction andoperation of a cogeneration facility.A categorical exclusion raises a rebuttable presumption that the Federalaction will not significantly affect the quality of the human environment.Unless it appears during the proceedings, on this import application thatthe grant or denial of interim authorization will significantly affectthe quality of the human environment, FE expects that no additional environmentalreview will be required.The decision on Project Orange's application for interim authorizationwould be final with respect to gas transported through pipeline facilitiesthat currently exist. However, no final decision will be issued in thisproceeding for imports which are dependent on Tennessee expanding its systemcapacity until the DOE completes a NEPA review of the environmental effectsassociated wih constructing and operating the proposed additional facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments. Any personwishing to become a party to the proceeding and to have the written commentsconsidered as the basis for any decision on the application, must, however,file a motion to intervene or notice of intervention, as applicable. Thefiling of a protest with respect to this application will not serve tomake the protestant a party to the proceeding, although protests and commentsreceived from persons who are not parties will be considered in determiningthe appropriate action to be taken on the application. Persons who havealready been granted permission to intervene in this docket need not filenew motions to intervene, but may submit additional comments or requestadditional procedures in this case concerning Project Orange's requestto amend Order 274. All protests, motions to intervene, notices of intervention,and written comments must meet the requirements that are specified by theregulations in 10 CFR Part 590.Protests, motions to intervene, notices, of intervention, requests foradditional procedures, and written comments should be filed with the Officeof Fuels Programs, Fossil Energy, Room 3F-056, FE-50, Forrestal Building,1000 Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585, (202) 586-9478. Theymust be filed no later than 4:30 p.m., e.d.t., September 8, 1989.It is intended that a decisional record on the application will be developedthrough responses to this notice by parties, including the parties' writtencomments and replies thereto. Additional procedures will be used as necessaryto achieve a complete understanding of the facts and issues. A party seekingintervention may request that additional procedures be provided, such asadditional written comments, an oral presentation, a conference, or a trial-typehearing. Any request to file additional written comments should explainwhy they are necessary.
