<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-0177 </DOCNO><TEXT>A case is reported of a multiple myeloma exhibiting symptoms of paraparesisas an initial manifestation following tetraparesis, but with no particularcommon symptoms of multiple myeloma. Laboratory findings, however, stronglysuggested multiple myeloma, and this was confirmed by a biopsy. Radiologicalinvestigations could not show all the features of this tumor invasion,but revealed only the osteosclerotic and destructive changes in the cervicaland thoracic spine, plus a complete block at the C2 level. Magnetic resonanceimaging, however, disclosed entire lesions. There existed multiple vertebralinvolvements and an epidural invasion of the tumor, continuing to anextraspinal mass. Multiple myeloma is a disorder with varied manifestations;it is rarely present as a primary neuropathological entity. Among thesemanifestations, initial neurological manifestations in the form of peripheralneuropathy have been reported most commonly. Unusual clinical presentationssuch as in our case may result in an erroneous and delayed diagnosisunless an early and correct identification of the lesion is made. Magneticresonance imaging is thought to be the most useful technique to detectsuch a multiple lesion in the spinal canal with no invasive manipulation.</TEXT></DOC>
