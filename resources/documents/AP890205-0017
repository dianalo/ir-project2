But Chicagoans are basking in the balmypolitical clime.   ``Things have been so quiet that I got back from a vacation,looked at the papers, and thought maybe the plane had landed inMinneapolis,'' said Mike Royko, the Chicago Tribune's PulitzerPrize-winning columnist.   With three weeks remaining before the Feb. 28 Democratic primary,political analysts attribute the relative calm to the personalitiesinvolved: acting Mayor Eugene Sawyer, 54, and front-runner RichardM. Daley, 44, the Cook County state's attorney and son of the lateMayor Richard J. Daley. A third candidate, Alderman Lawrence Bloom,is not considered a factor in the primary race.   In this heavily Democratic city, the winner of the primary isnearly assured of victory. The general election is April 4.   All has not been sweetness and light between Sawyer, who isblack, and Daley, who is white.   Sawyer has tried on occasion to stir up the bad memories someblacks have of Daley's father because of the riots that followed theassassination in 1968 of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Morerecently he charged that Daley covered up the involvement of thosein his office who may have collected bogus petition signatures.   Daley, in turn, has accused Sawyer of trying to tax his way outof a financial bind and suggested his opponent has accomplishedlittle on his own since being installed as mayor by the City Councilin December 1987, shortly after Mayor Harold Washington died.   But neither side has resorted to the mudslinging or the politicsof race that marked both the 1983 campaign that culminated inWashington's election as the city's first black mayor andWashington's successful 1987 re-election campaign.   The issues _ chiefly crime, education and affordable housing _have received a more thorough airing than during any of the previouselections this decade.   The civility might seem especially surprising in light of recentpolls showing Daley with a commanding lead. Support for the county'stop prosecutor has been hovering at about 50 percent against about30 percent for Sawyer, 10 percent for Bloom and 10 percent undecided.   The same polls have shown Daley with support from as much as 15percent to 20 percent of the black electorate, athough theendorsement of Sawyer by Jesse Jackson on Jan. 24 may result in someslippage.   Chicago's population is roughly 40 percent white, 40 percentblack, 15 percent Hispanic and less than 5 percent people of otherraces.   Political observers say the agreeable natures of both candidatesare not the only reason for the calm.   ``The mud just doesn't seem to be sticking,'' said EugeneKennedy, a Loyola University professor and author of ``Himself,'' abiography of the elder Daley, the last of the big-city politicalbosses.   ``Maybe it's because people are worn out by the spate ofpolitical campaigns over the last two years, or because both menhave their base constituencies intact ... and are down to fightingfor the mostly liberal swing vote, who like `nice, clean' candidates.   ``But what I would call an almost unnatural calm is, quitefrankly, probably more the result of two men running who are neitherexciting nor willing, nor perhaps even able, to engage the voters'imagination,'' Kennedy concluded. ``They're even scared of debatingone another.''   A debate Tuesday is the only one scheduled between Daley andSawyer. The two have sparred over the terms of other proposeddebates.   Clarence Page, a member of the Tribune's editorial board andfrequent political commentator, said another element contributing tothe peaceful campaign is the city's ``newfound political maturity.''   ``For one thing, politics here were retarded for years because wehad a political machine under (the elder) Daley that for decadesstunted people's aspirations, especially in the minoritycommunities,'' Page said.   ``Harold Washington sort of ushered us beyond that. He showedwhites there was no reason to fear a black mayor. He showed blacksthe political process was a legitimate channel to gain power.''   But just as the weather took a turn for the worse last week,Royko, Kennedy and Page agree that the campaign could, too, ifSawyer panics and thinks he's too far behind, or Daley decides he'snot far enough ahead.   All three also say a Daley win in the primary could cause blacksto adopt more desperate measures when Alderman Tim Evans, who isblack and like Sawyer was part of the late Mayor Washington'scoalition, makes his third-party challenge in the general election.   ``But when you consider we've got this far and everybody's beenas a nice as they are,'' Page said, ``that's already quite anaccomplishment.''</TEXT></DOC>
