A trial unit of ceramic fiber type 20 MW classcombustor was constructed and tested. Woven fabric of SiC fibers in 35layers (thickness: 10 mm) was sewed and fastened with SiC threads. Stablecombustion was demonstrated in a normal pressure combustion test. Seep-outcooling with high efficiency was observed. The temperature of metal wallwas equal to inlet air temperature and uniformly distributed. An equationwas established for pressure drop of cooling air flow. The pattern factorof outlet gas temperature distribution was similar to those of existingcombustors. A part of uppermost layer of fibers on the combustion gasside was separated in the test for 9h, including quick fuel interruptionat high loads since the SiC fibers become brittle at temperature exceeding1000{sup 0}C. The applicability of ceramic fibers to combustor liningis expected to be high when fibers with high durability at high temperatureis used or manufacturing and fastening method of fiber layers are improved.(13 figs, 2 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
