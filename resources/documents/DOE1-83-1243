The mine is drained by a system of deep wells. Drawdown conearea exceeds 300 km{sup 2}. Due to complicated tectonics and numerousfaults, three aquifer levels form one system. Ground subsidence in themine area is caused by water draining (reducing rock strata weight andinfluencing rock strata properties) and by a spoil bank which increasesstresses in the mine area. On the basis of statistical data that describesground movement caused by water draining and spoil bank contruction,statistical models for forecasting ground subsidence are developed. Practicaluse of the models is verified. 4 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
