Although no new takeover or buy-back deals were announced yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 3.02 points to 2173.36; broader market indexes were up less. Analysts said investors, encouraged by the gargantuan deals recently announced, are looking for the next takeover candidates among big companies.    The lack of takeover activity in small stocks was reflected in the third consecutive drop in the Nasdaq composite index of over-the-counter issues.    While speculative buying of potential takeover targets may help keep stock prices firm in the short run, some market professionals complain that takeovers alone make for a dangerous market.    &quot;It's a leaderless market which is being stimulated to greater trading activity by deals that, a year or two ago, would have been considered preposterous,&quot; said Thom R. Brown, a managing director at Rutherford, Brown andamp; Catherwood in Philadelphia. He said the takeover binge eventually will end and &quot;the hangover at the end of this party will probably be pretty nasty.&quot;    John Connolly, an investment strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds, said stock prices also reflect a growing perception among investors that the economy is slowing, easing pressures on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. He said the bond market's recent rally has about run its course, leaving investors with few choices other than stocks.    &quot;There's no place to go in the bond market and with interest rates coming down, cash won't do you much good,&quot; he said.    Tom Prappas, chief economist and portfolio manager for the Freedom Global Income Plus Fund, agreed that in the short term Treasury bond prices have risen about as high as they can. He said the dollar remains vulnerable because of the U.S. trade position, limiting the Fed's ability to ease interest rates.    In major market activity yesterday:   Stock prices were mixed in modest trading. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 155.2 million shares. While the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed higher, declining issues on the Big Board were ahead of advancers 736-719.    Bond prices were unchanged. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond yielded 8.93%.    The dollar lost ground against the mark and the yen. In late New York trading the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.7888 marks and 126.78 yen, compared with 1.7938 marks and 126.98 yen Monday.
