Prime Minister Mohammad Khan Junejo spent the weekend consultingCabinet ministers and opposition lawmakers over whether to couple aSoviet troop withdrawal from Afghanistan with the formation of aninterim Kabul government.   He convened a closed joint session of Parliament to debate theissue Sunday night and was scheduled to hold another Cabinetmeeting today.   ``We will contribute positively to the talks in accordance withthe aspirations of our people,'' the state minister for foreignaffairs, Zain Noorani, said today as he prepared to depart fromIslamabad airport as head of the Pakistani delegation.   On Wednesday, it is to begin working out the final details of aSoviet troop withdrawal indirectly with Kabul's communistgovernment.   Informed Pakistani and foreign sources in Islamabad, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said Islamabad still has not decidedwhether to sign an accord with the governing People's DemocraticParty of Afghanistan under its current leader, Najib.   Moscow, which first sent troops to Afghanistan in December 1979,announced Feb. 8 it is prepared to start pulling out its estimated115,000 troops beginning May 15.   However, Pakistani officials recently have insisted that a peaceaccord should be accompanied by a political settlement to ensurethe safe return of about 3.5 million Afghan refugees now inPakistan.   Afghan resistance leaders, headquartered in Peshawar, Pakistan,last week proposed an interim government virtually excludingNajib's party. Najib criticized the proposal over the weekend,according to official radio Kabul.   Washington, the Moslem rebels' main military backer, has said apolitical accord was ``desireable'' but should not hold up theGeneva document, which would pave the way for a Soviet pullout.   Prime Minister Junejo has taken the unprecedented step ofcalling opposition groups outside Parliament for consultations onthe issue on March 5. Minister Noorani is scheduled to return toIslamabad for the meeting.   Opposition leaders, including Benazir Bhutto of the PakistanPeople's Party, withheld immediate response to the invitation.Officials of their umbrella organization, the Movement for theRestoration of Democracy, indicated they will reply in unison.   The hectic political activity has been typical since Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev made his dramatic Feb. 8 offer to startbringing the Red Army home 60 days after the signing of a Genevaaccord.   In a surprise move, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi of India onSaturday invited Pakistan President Mohammad Zia ul-haq to NewDelhi to discuss the issue, but Zia declined by reversing theinvitation.   Indian Foreign Secretary K.P.S. Menon on Tuesday will come toIslamabad instead, it was decided.   Pakistan based its rebuff on India's pro-Soviet stance andGandhi's repeated refusal to accept Zia's invitations to Islamabad.Zia went to New Delhi in December 1985 in hopes of launchingfriendship talks, but Gandhi has never reciprocated.</TEXT></DOC>
