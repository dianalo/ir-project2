At least three people were killed in Sunday's massacre, said aforeign journalist who escaped, and radio reports said 60 werewounded. Some witnesses said as many as a dozen people were killed.   Shielded by supporters, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide escapeduninjured.   After the attack, gangs of armed men roamed the capital'sdeserted streets, stoning two radio stations and the headquartersof two political parties opposed to the government of Lt. Gen.Henri Namphy.   Men fired shots about outside one of the stations, RomanCatholic-run Radio Soleil, which went off the air after beingpelted by rocks.   A Catholic priest and a former Senate candidate blamed thegovernment for the attack, which preceded a planned Sunday protestagainst Namphy's voiding of Haiti's popularly approved Constitution.   Attacks on civilians by armed thugs accused of support from themilitary are not uncommon in the 2{ years since the Duvalier familydictatorship ended. On Nov. 29, 1987, armed thugs and soldierskilled at least 34 voters in thwarting independently run nationwideelections.   On Sunday, Aristide had just begun 9 a.m. Mass when a group ofmen started stoning the church, said the foreign journalist, whowas attending.   Then men shouting ``Communists, Communists!'' burst into thechurch, slashing and hacking mercilessly at men, women and childrenas they fled the church in panic, the journalist said.   ``They started shooting people, beating them, and stabbing andslashing them,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone callto New York. ``They stabbed a woman who was pregnant. They stabbedanother man who ran outside the church. He died. some people wereshot.'' Another witness saw a pregnant woman shot in the abdomen.   Soldiers at a compound across the street watched the violentattack but did not intervene.   Asked for official government reaction, Frantz Lubin, directorof information for the military government, responded, ``No commentbefore all the facts have been gathered.''   Some witnesses said about a dozen people were killed, but thebodies could not be removed before the attackers set the buildingon fire and torched cars parked out front. Some said they saw theassailants remove bodies from the churchyard.   Radio stations reported 60 were treated for wounds.   Estimates of the number of people in the church ranged from 600to 1,600.   A witness in the church's nearby health center said he watchedas about 300 men fell into formation and marched to the entrance ofthe church compound, and stoned the courtyard and the church beforea gang of them rushed inside.   The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity.   The Crusade for the Constitution Committee, headed by thepolitical opposition, had urged Haitians to dress in white Sundayto protest Namphy's voiding of the constitution in July.   ``The relationship between the crusade and the massacre isobvious,'' said the Rev. Antoine Adrien, a Catholic priest. ``Thereis a campaign to bring the country back to the Duvalier days, tore-establish a reign of terror, to prevent the people fromorganizing for their welfare.''   Paul Latortue, a former Senate candidate, said he was sure thechurch attack was the work of the government and its supporters.   ``They have wanted to kill Aristide for a long time,'' he saidin San Juan, where he teaches economics at the University of PuertoRico. ``It is significant that the government tried to do thistoday, a day of protest.''   Aristide, who in sermons has compared Haiti's army rulers tosavages and Satan, is one of the most popular figures among thisCaribbean nation's poor masses and has been the target of severalassassination attempts.   His modest, cement-block St. Jean Bosco Church, inside acompound in the La Saline slum, is regularly packed with supporters.   Aristide has never called for an armed uprising, but hasrepeatedly advocated the overthrow of the military government bywhat he calls ``active non-violent struggle.''   Namphy returned to power in a coup June 19 after four months ofcivilian rule under President Leslie Manigat. Namphy ruled for twoyears before that as head of a junta after President Jean-ClaudeDuvalier fled to exile in France on Feb. 7, 1986.   The constitution was approved by more than 99 percent of thevoters in a March 29, 1987, referendum. It is considered the mostliberal in the country's 184-year history and prohibited Duvaliersupporters from running for office for 10 years.</TEXT></DOC>
