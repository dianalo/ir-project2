The indirect heat exchange havingan overall heat transfer coefficient U/sub {omicron}/, separating theliquid portion of the hydrocarbon phase from the vapor portion thereofin a second separating zone, fractionating the liquid portion of thehydrocarbon phase to remove alkylate, passing the vapor phase materialremoved in the second separating zone through a compressor and a condenserto compress and condense the vapor phase to form a liquid phase, reducingthe pressure on the liquid phase to refrigerate it and vaporize volatilehydrocarbons forming an isoparaffinic hydrocarbon liquid phase and avolatile hydrocarbon vapor phase, separating the refrigerated isoparaffinichydrocarbon liquid phase from the volatile hydrocarbon vapor phase ina third separating zone, and adding the separated refrigerated isoparaffinichydrocarbon liquid phase as a reactant in the reaction zone.</TEXT></DOC>
