Iberia now holds 24 firm orders and four options for MD-80s as part of its plan to eventually replace all of its 28 DC-9s for international service in Europe. Iberia elected to take all of the seven new planes it ordered as model MD-87s, a 109-passenger version of the MD-80, which it will configure in a two-class arrangement. Delivery will begin next June, said Douglas Aircraft, which is based in Long Beach, Calif.    The domestic Spanish carrier Aviaco ordered five MD-88 models for delivery beginning in August 1991. The MD-88 seats a maximum of 155 passengers. Both the MD-88s and MD-87s will be powered by Pratt andamp; Whitney JT8D-217C engines. </TEXT></DOC>
