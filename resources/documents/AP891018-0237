(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   When school officials told 10-year-oldAudrey Pearson she couldn't read the Bible on the school bus, thegirl's mother turned for help to the Rutherford Institute.   Within days, Audrey was back reading her Bible on the bus.   The Rutherford Institute is devoted to religious free speech.``I want this group to be a beacon of light for people who giveup,'' said John W. Whitehead, who founded the institute in hisbasement here in 1982. ``There's just a myth out there if it's onpublic property, it can't be religious.''   Although Audrey's case took only a few telephone calls, theRutherford Institute has successfully defended cases to the U.S.Supreme Court.   In seven years, the institute has grown to 21 state chaptersacross the country and has an annual budget of $800,000. Fortystaff attorneys handled 75 cases last year, up from 40 cases theyear before, Whitehead said.   The institute, which has helped people recently in Nigeria,Canada and India, plans to open offices overseas, Whitehead said.The institute recently moved to Charlottesville.   Michael Patrick, executive director of the institute, said itaverages 25 calls for help a day and is defending 600 people now.That does not include calls seeking information and educationalmaterials, he said.   Ellen Pearson said she heard about the institute after readingan essay by Whitehead in a book, ``Biblical Principles for GodlyLiving,'' and remembered it when her daughter was forbidden to readthe Bible.   She said she first tried to send Audrey to school with a lapdesk, dolls and other items to entertain herself on the one-hourride and was told they were unsafe.   ``I said I am going to let her bring books to school and I saidbecause she loves God's word she probably will bring God's word,''Mrs. Pearson said. ``The teacher got quiet and she called me backin five minutes and said the principal said she couldn't bringthat.''   Mrs. Pearson said she called the principal of DumfriesElementary School, Nicolette Rinaldo, who said she knew that a rulesomewhere said children could not bring Bibles to school.   An institute attorney called school officials to straighten outthe matter.   ``I didn't think it was handled any differently than any otherformal request to the principal,'' Mrs. Rinaldo said. ``You'retalking about religious material, and normally children don't bringreligious material to school.''   ``The root of it is fear and a lack of knowledge,'' Patricksaid. ``It (the book) could have been a Stephen King novel.''   The group operates largely on donations from people who haveheard about the institute; Patrick said 90 percent of donations areless than $100 and most are for $10 or $15.   None of the institute's 40 staff attorneys is salaried. Theirexpenses are paid by grants from the national group, Patrick said.   One case the institute took successfully to the Supreme Courtinvolved an Illinois man who refused a job because religiousbeliefs prevented him from working Sundays. In March, the highcourt ruled in William Frazee's favor, overturning a ruling fromthe Appellate Court of Illinois. The lower court had ruled thatFrazee's personal religious convictions did not constitute goodcause for declining a job. Frazee had been denied unemploymentbenefits.   ``The sad part is, for every one of these there's a dozen thatgo unreported,'' Patrick said. He said the institute is trying todispel a notion that religious speech is less free than otherspeech.   ``If it's really a free-speech position, why should I beconcerned about what kind of free speech?'' Patrick said. ``We'reonly as free as the rights of the least free _ religious people.''   With that idea in mind, the institute has defended points ofview that might seem surprising.   Whitehead said the institute once assisted a Virginia man whowanted to put ``atheist'' on his license tag. The stateTransportation Department told the man he could not.   ``It's a church-state issue,'' Whitehead said. ``If you can'tput `atheist' on a license plate, you can't put `theist.'''   Barry Lynn, legislative counsel for the American Civil LibertiesUnion, said the Rutherford Institute ``is much more willing thanthe Constitution is to allow government support for religiousactivity'' such as allowing religious clubs to meet in publicschools.   ``They obviously have a right to promote their view of theConstitution,'' Lynn said. ``In many instances, it is fundamentallydifferent from ours and fundamentally wrong.   ``What they like to say is all speech is the same,'' Lynn said.``It's not. You have to be more careful of any appearance ofgovernment sponsorship for religious activities.''   Of Audrey Pearson, Lynn said, ``That's probably a case wherewe're on the same side. Individual religious experiences in apublic place do not necessarily violate the Constitution.''   Benton Miller, manager of marketing and public affairs forConservative Digest and a former staffer at the ChristianBroadcasting Network, praised the institute for educating peopleabout religious liberties.   ``It's hard to be involved in the issues unless you understandthe issues enough to make a difference,'' Miller said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Oct. 20</NOTE></DOC>
