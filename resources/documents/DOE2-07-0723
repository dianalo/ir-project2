However, the synopsis of the relevant legalprescriptions of the regulation systems, the historical development coursesof regulations, analytic excursions and statistical information aboutthe structures of the markets could not be included in the investigation.This gap is now closed by the special issue 'Government-guided marketregulation in the Federal Republic of Germany'. Among others, it dealswith the regulation of the supplying industry: it shows the structuresof the most important sections and the market-regulating acts of thegovernment: competition-restricting instruments, price regulation bythe government and the restraint to contract.
