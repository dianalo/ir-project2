(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former PTL budget director testifiedtoday that ministry founder Jim Bakker asked him to manipulatefigures until he could show that one type of ``partnership'' in PTLcould be worth $1 million to a family.   Prosecutors say Bakker, 49, used nearly $4 million in ministryfunds obtained from the sale of partnerships in the ministry's hotelto bankroll his extravagant lifestyle. Partners, who gave at least$1,000, were told they were guaranteed a certain number of nightsper year in the hotel, at the ministry's Heritage USA retreat nearFort Mill, S.C.   Former PTL budget director Mark Burgund testified today that in1985 Bakker asked him to determine how to show that one partnershipprogram, the ``Silver 7,000'' program, would be worth more than $1million. Those partnerships cost up to $3,000.   ``Jim Bakker asked me to make up a chart showing the value of theSilver 7,000 membership over a period of time,'' Burgund said. Whenhe told Bakker it would be worth $84,000 over 30 years for a familyof four, Bakker told him to make it for a family of five. ``Figureit out to make it worth $1 million,'' Burgund quoted Bakker assaying.   Burgund testified he sent a series of memos to Bakker showingthat to get $1 million of use out of a partnership, a family of fivewould have to go to PTL once a year for a week-long free stay for 50years and would have to use every facility at Heritage USA, evenfacilities not yet constructed, such as a bowling alley.   Bakker then used those figures in selling the partnerships,Burgund said.   But prosecutor Deborah Smith said even Burglund's figures wereinflated, saying a family of five would actually have to stay at theresort far longer than five days a year for them to get $1 millionworth of services from a partnership.   On Thursday, five so-called PTL lifetime partners testified thatthey paid PTL for lodging at Heritage USA, but then were told therewere no vacancies when they tried to use the hotel.   ``There were more people than there was room,'' said LamarKerstetter, a retired coal miner from Shamokin, Pa., who suffersfrom black lung disease and cancer and lives on disability insurance.   Bakker's lawyers asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inRichmond, Va., on Thursday to halt the fraud and conspiracy trial,pending an appeal of U.S. District Judge Robert Potter's refusal todismiss the charges against Bakker.   Lawyers Harold Bender and George T. Davis on Wednesday askedPotter to throw out the charges against Bakker, citing possiblegrand jury misconduct.   Defense attorneys claim Jessica Hahn told a Charlotte radiostation that a grand jurors approached her in a courthouse restroomand asked for her autograph during a break in her testimony inSeptember 1987.   Bakker's attorneys said the grand jurors violated their oath ofimpartiality, and thus tainted the process leading to Bakker'sindictment.   Bakker unveiled the lifetime partnerships program in early 1984,telling donors he would offer 25,000 partnerships in the 504-roomHeritage Grand Hotel, then under construction. Only half the hotelrooms were available for partners.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller asked Kerstetter what heexpected to get for $1,000 he paid for a partnership in March 1987,the same month Bakker resigned from PTL after disclosure of hissexual encounter with Ms. Hahn.   ``My four days and three nights,'' Kerstetter responded. ``I wasbuying a product. I was buying lodging and use of the park.''   Thursday was the first full day of testimony after the trialresumed following Bakker's breakdown and commitment to a federalprison for psychiatric evaluation last week.   Lila Angel, 89, of Atlantic Beach, Fla., and her daughter, DanaAngel, testified that they split the cost of a $1,000 partnership,putting the purchase on their Visa cards. Both women are retired andlive on Social Security.   Lila Angel testified that she expected a return for her money.``I worked until I was 77, and I save my pennies. I still do. That$500 was quite a bit of money for me,'' she said.   Defense attorneys had said in opening arguments that money givento the ministry was in the form of donations, not meant as moneypaid for a product.   William Maybrey, the general manager of Heritage Grand Hotel fromApril 1984 to December 1985, testified that an Oct. 14, 1985, memodisclosed 63,512 lifetime partnerships had been sold.   Asked by prosecutors whether 63,512 partners could beaccommodated at the hotel, Mabrey replied: ``It would be impossibleto do.''   Prosecutors also produced a series of witnesses Thursdaydocumenting purchases of luxury cars and a corporate jet by PTL orBakker, and PTL's 1984 charter of a corporate jet at a cost of$100,000.   Thursday morning, Bakker's wife, Tammy, criticized U.S. marshals'treatment of her husband while he was in their custody and read aphone number for the U.S. Justice Department in Washington.   She then urged people to call to complain, ``because the nextperson that's treated this way could be your husband or yourminister or someone that you love.''   Three special telephone lines were set up at the JusticeDepartment, and department spokesman Joe Krovisky said the operatorswere getting ``a continuous stream'' of calls from people protestingthe prosecution of the former PTL leader.</TEXT></DOC>
