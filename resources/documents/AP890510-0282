On a 25-11 vote with two of 11 Republicans siding with all itsDemocrats, the House Ways and Means Committee rejected Bush'selaborate financing scheme to prevent the most expensive governmentbailout in history from swelling the deficit.   Republicans predicted that the vote will upset a delicate ``nonew taxes'' deficit reducing budget agreement with the White Housethat was approved just last week by the House and Senate.   ``We've fairly well destroyed the budget agreement between theadministration and Congress,'' complained Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.   Democrats, however, called it an attempt at ``honest budgetingfor a change,'' citing the fact that past deficit reduction targetshave never been met in reality.   The vote was the first major setback for Bush's bailout plan,which moved through the Senate and the House Banking Committee withonly minor changes in response to repeated administration vows of aveto if it was altered greatly.   Reps. Willis D. Gradison of Ohio and Raymnond J. McGrath of NewYork were the two Republicans who sided with the panel's 23Democrats in voting for an amendment by Rep. Sam Gibbons, D-Fla.,to add the Sandamp;L bailout to the deficit.   ``I have great ethical and moral problems with the way thisprogram is financed'' under Bush's plan, Gibbons said. ``This is amess that ought to be cleaned up without ... passing the costs onto our children and grandchildren.''   As a way to prevent the Sandamp;L crisis from showing up in thefederal deficit, the administration proposed raising the immediate$50 billion infusion of cash to cover Sandamp;L failures with a sale of30-year bonds to be issued by a new quasi-government agency, theResolution Financing Corp.   Critics, including the Congressional Budget Office, maintainthat this approach will cost taxpayers a total of $4.5 billion morein interest payments over the next 30 years than if the money wasborrowed directly through the U.S. Treasury.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady spent more than an hour todaymeeting behind closed doors with members of the Ways and MeansCommittee, repeating a threat he made earlier to recommend thatBush veto any plan that would add to the deficit.'   Brady left the meeting smiling. But when asked by reporters ifBush's plan had sufficient support in the committee, he said only,``You never know about that. We'll have to wait and see.''   Gibbons led the attack on the administration's plan after thecommittee's chairman, Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said Tuesdaythat he would not mount an offensive against it.   ``I am not working the committee to achieve any result,''Rostenkowski said. ``Reasonable people can differ on the issue. Allmembers ... should vote the way they want.''   Richard Breeden, a White House assistant and the prime architectof Bush's Sandamp;L plan, on Tuesday repeated earlier threats byadministration officials to recommend that Bush veto any bill thatwould increase the federal deficit.   Similar threats earlier stopped an alternative proposed bySenate Democrats and members of the House Banking Committee cold inits tracks. Both the House Banking panel and the full Senatealready have approved Bush's plan.   In a ``walkthrough'' Tuesday of possible ways they could changethe package, several Ways and Means Democrats and one Republican,Rep. Willis Gradison of Ohio, said they still would like to replaceBush's financing plan with one advocated by the CongressionalBudget Office.   By including the bailout's cost as part of the budget andborrowing the funds directly through the Treasury, CBO expertscontend, the government could save interest costs totaling $1.5billion over the next 10 years.   However, Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mullins told thelawmakers the required waiver would drive a ``battering ram''through the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law unless taxes areincreased or offsetting cuts are made elsewhere in the budget.   ``We don't want it used as an excuse to create a hole inGramm-Rudman so that any mega-financing needs can get a waiver,''Mullins said, citing as an example the hundreds of millions ofdollars that a nuclear weapons plant cleanup is now anticipated tocost.   But Rep. Frank Guarini, D-N.J., complained that Bush's plan willmake a ``big winner'' out of Wall Street investment houses throughcommissions in handling off-budget bonds that will be used tofinance the government's share of the bailout.   The Ways and Means panel also may challenge a provision insertedin the bill by the House Banking Committee to require Sandamp;Ls todevote $75 million to $150 million of their annual profits tosubsidize low-income home mortgages.   ``We believe that looks like a tax,'' said Ronald Pearlman, headof the Joint Committee on Taxation's staff.   The committee also is looking at whether to continue widelycriticized tax breaks for companies that take failed Sandamp;Ls off thegovernment's hands.   Investors and corporations such as Ford Motor Co. received atotal of more than $8 billion in tax breaks last year underlong-term agreements to take some 170 failed Sandamp;Ls off thegovernment's hands.   Those provisions _ such as tax-free treatment of governmentsubsidies in the mergers and allowing buyers to use the losses ofthe thrifts they bought to offset income from other operations _are due to expire at the end of this year. In its bill, the Senateurged that they be wiped out immediately.</TEXT></DOC>
