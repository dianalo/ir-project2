That's the message the Kuwait government-in-exile issending to the world's jittery financial markets, where sharevalues have plummeted because of investor nervousness aboutthe prospect of war, higher oil prices and the possibilitythat Kuwait could liquidate its massive overseas financialholdings to raise cash.</LP><TEXT>   The buy signal was sent out at an unusual weekend newsconference here, held by Kuwait's Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah,minister of finance. Sheik Ali is one of the seniorgovernment figures responsible for the management of Kuwait'sestimated $100 billion in overseas assets. Since Iraq'sinvasion, London has become the refuge and headquarters ofmost of Kuwait's exiled business leaders, with a nucleusforming around the London-based Kuwait Investment Office,which manages most of the country's overseas holdings.   Sheik Ali is spearheading efforts to keep his nation'seconomy-in-exile thriving despite the Iraqi occupation and aworld-wide asset freeze that hampers normal operations.   Sheik Ali has spent recent days on a whirlwind tour ofKuwaiti investments in Spain, Germany and Britain. He saidthat because central banks world-wide are allowing Kuwait tocontinue to manage its investments, the Kuwait government andthe KIO &quot;don't feel in any way harmed&quot; by the asset freeze.   In fact, on Friday Kuwait's government-in-exile reportedlyenlarged its previous 20% stake in the West German trading,metals and chemicals group Metallgesellschaft AG. TheFrankfurter Rundschau, a German newspaper, reported that theKIO bought shares on the West German stock markets and thatMetallgesellschaft was one of the issues acquired. It didn'tidentify the others.   Sheik Ali said he and Kuwaiti fund managers in Europe haveconcluded that recent declines in world market prices mayoffer a good buying opportunity. &quot;In the past we have mademoney in being contrarians. We think the markets may havegone down too much,&quot; he said.   Sheik Ali appeared to base much of his reasoning on theassumption of a quick resolution of the Gulf crisis. Hedeclined to specify what particular investments the Kuwaitisare making. But he said the KIO's fund managers are planningto commit more funds to the German markets and areconsidering the same for Britain and much of Europe. Hedidn't mention the U.S., where Kuwaiti financial holdings arewidely spread.   He added that &quot;just as our investment managers are takinga contrarian view and perhaps going into the market, so ouroil people expect the price of oil to go down.&quot; He said someof the traders responsible for assuring supplies to KuwaitPetroleum, one of Europe's largest gasoline retailers, areselling excess stocks.   London traders say the Kuwaiti investment funds wereactive sellers in the world markets for the first few daysafter the Aug 2. invasion; since then they have sat mostly onthe sidelines. Sheik Ali said the invasion currently isn'tforcing any sales. &quot;We have plenty of cash. We do not need toliquidate anything,&quot; he said. He added that Kuwait intends tohold on to its major strategic blocks in blue-chip companies.In West Germany, for example, Kuwait owns roughly 14% of automaker Daimler-Benz AG and just under 20% of chemicals giantHoechst AG. In the U.S., it owns Santa Fe InternationalCorp., a San Francisco-based oil and gas concern.</TEXT></DOC>
