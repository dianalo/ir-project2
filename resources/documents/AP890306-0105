They said about 625,000 of the 2 million to 3 million peopledisplaced by the six-year war in the south may die of startvationduring the April-December rainy season unles something is done. Thepledge of a ``month of tranquility'' will be sought during a two-dayconference that begins Wednesday in Khartoum.   Relief workers would use the cease-fire to send food and medicinesouth by plane, train and Nile River barge to create stockpilesagainst famine and disease, said the officials, all of whom demandedanonymity under orders from their agencies.   ``We want to pre-position food and medicine and clothes so peoplewon't be caught between the conflict and the famine,'' one officialsaid. ``They need a massive operation.''   Both the government and the Sudan People's Liberation Army offormer army Col. John Garang have used food as a weapon. Westernrelief officials estimate that in 1988 alone, more than 560,000people died of starvation or while fleeing the fighting.   U.N. and aid officials said they would use the conference topressure both sides to accept the temporary cease-fire, but rebelclaims of victory and political uncertanity in Khartoum could upsettheir plans.   A U.N. official said the conference would set goals and initiateplans for stockpiling food and medicine. It is to be attended byU.N. representatives, Western donors and the government.   Rebel radio, broadcasting from neighboring Ethiopia, saidGarang's forces had overrun two garrison towns, Nimule and Parajok,in the Equatoria region along the border with Uganda.It warnedforeigners to leave Juba, the regional capita., where 15,000 rebelshave 5,000 soldiers beseiged.   Officials of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees office said20,000 civilians and army soldiers fled into northern Uganda in thepast two days and emergency help was being flown to them. Up to5,000 other Sudanese have crossed into Uganda.   Garang's rebel army began fighting in 1983 for autonomy and morefavorable economic treatment in the south, whose people arepredominantly black Christians and animists. The government isdominated by the northern Sudanese, most of whom are Moslem Arabs.   Several rebel military victories have been reported in the pastfew months. Western military sources say the insurgents have betterarms than government troops and now have about 55,000-57,000fighters facing a Sudanese army of 65,000 men.   The Western sources said the army's situation could grow worse inthe rainy season, when the rebels usually have the battlefieldadvantage.   Prime Minister Sadek Mahdi, whose 3-year-old regime just surviveda crisis caused by pressure from the military, politicians and thepublic to end the war, consulted with other parties Monday aboutforming a broad-based government.   Government sources said privately Mahdi would visit Libya onTuesday despite the delicate political situation. The Westernmilitary sources said Libya had offered its southern neighbor $280million worth of weapons.   Sources close to the aid conference, speaking on condition ofanonymity, said the intention was to send up to 100,000 tons ofsupplies to the three southern regions of Africa's largest country.   ``There is no problem with the food; we have it,'' one sourcesaid. ``It is transportion which is a problem.   ``Ideally we would have liked both the government and the rebelsto be at this conference, but the United States and the donors areholding contacts with SPLA (rebels) and hope to put enough pressureon it and the government to reach an agreement,'' he said.   The United States has put pressure on Mahdi's government forpeace talks and has urged other doners to do the same.</TEXT></DOC>
