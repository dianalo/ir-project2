There are 69days left in the year.   Today's highlight in history:   Five years ago, 241 U.S. Marines and sailors in Lebanon died inan explosion caused by a suicide truck-bomber who crashed into theU.S. compound at Beirut International Airport. An almostsimultaneous attack on French forces in the Lebanese capital alsoclaimed the lives of 58 paratroopers.   On this date:   In 1864, forces led by Union Gen. Samuel R. Curtis defeatedConfederate Gen. Stirling Price's army in Missouri.   In 1910, Blanche S. Scott became the first woman to make a solo,public airplane flight, reaching an altitude of 12 feet as shesailed across a park in Fort Wayne, Ind.   In 1915, 25,000 women marched in New York City, demanding theright to vote.   In 1942, during World War II, Britain launched a major offensiveagainst Axis forces at El Alamein, Egypt.   In 1946, the U.N. General Assembly convened in New York for thefirst time, at an auditorium in Flushing Meadow.   In 1947, Screen Actors Guild President Ronald Reagan told theHouse Un-American Activities Committee the best way to combatCommunist influence in Hollywood was ``to make democracy work.''   In 1956, an anti-Stalinist revolt that was subsequently crushedby Soviet troops began in Hungary.   In 1958, Soviet poet and novelist Boris Pasternak, author of``Doctor Zhivago,'' was named winner of the Nobel Prize inliterature. (However, Kremlin authorities succeeded in pressuringPasternak into relinquishing the award.)   In 1973, in a surprising reversal, President Richard M. Nixonagreed to turn White House tape recordings requested by theWatergate special prosecutor over to Judge John J. Sirica.   In 1980, Soviet Premier Alexei N. Kosygin, a fixture of the topSoviet leadership for 16 years, resigned his post because ofillness.   Ten years ago: China and Japan exchanged treaty ratificationdocuments in Tokyo, formally ending four decades of hostilitybetween the two Asian powers.   One year ago: The U.S. Senate rejected, 58-42, the Supreme Courtnomination of Robert H. Bork, who became the 26th nominee inhistory to be denied confirmation to the nation's highest court,and the 11th to be defeated by a vote of the full Senate.   Today's birthdays: ``Tonight'' host Johnny Carson is 63. Sen.John Heinz, R-Pa., is 50. Soccer great Pele is 48. Author-filmdirector Michael Crichton is 46.   Thought for today: ``What this country needs is a good five-centnickel.'' _Franklin P. Adams, American humorist (1881-1960).</TEXT></DOC>
