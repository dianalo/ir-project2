The indictment was unsealed Wednesday after a four-yearinvestigation by the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco andFirearms, said U.S. Attorney Ray Rukstele.   Five of those named were already in custody on drug andracketeering charges, including the drug runner whose freedom wasallegedly being sought. The two remaining suspects were arrestedWednesday, Rukstele said.   The indictment says the seven planned to bomb a nuclear powerplant, an East Coast airport, power transmission towers, a dam anda Navy ship in a scheme to barter the release of Jerry AllenLeQuire of Maryville, Tenn.   Rukstele declined to identify the intended targets.   LeQuire, 46, was convicted last year in an Alabama federal courtof importing about 33 tons of cocaine to the southeastern UnitedStates. He was sentenced to 20 years in prison, to be served aftera 36-year term he was already serving for other drug-relatedconvictions.   Indicted with LeQuire Tuesday were Bonnie Sue Anders, 41, ofCorbin, Ky.; Michael Carl Jenkins, 40, of Greenback, Tenn.; CharlesAllen LeQuire, 26, William Michael LeQuire, 28, and James ThomasLeQuire, 39, all of Maryville, Tenn.; and Gene Edward LeQuire, 42,of Louisville, Tenn.   Authorities would not comment beyond information contained inthe indictment, so it was not immediately clear how the otherLeQuires were related to Jerry Allen LeQuire.   The seven are charged with conspiracy to violate federalexplosives laws, two counts of detonating explosives to destroyproperty used in interstate commerce and illegally transportingexplosives across state lines. Jenkins also is accused of bombingtwo transmission towers near Atlanta in 1985.   The seven face possible 35-year jail sentences and fines of upto $1 million if convicted.   According to the indictment, the plot was supposed to work thisway:   The group would acquire explosives and rent a house in Orlando,Fla., where some of the explosives would be stored. An innocentdupe of Latin American origin would be found to live in the house.Jenkins was to carry out the actual bombings, the indictment said.   After each bombing, The Miami Herald would be phoned and toldthe bombings were in retaliation for American actions in CentralAmerica.   Jerry LeQuire then would offer, through his Latin American drugcontacts, to help ``find'' the bomber in exchange for his freedom.He would produce the address of the house and the dupe would bearrested.   The indictment does not say if a dupe was found. It says theplotting took place between June 1985 and January 1986.   The two arrested in Knoxville, Tenn., Wednesday were Gene andWilliam LeQuire, Rukstele said.</TEXT></DOC>
