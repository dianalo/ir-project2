The U.S. was obsessed with a hot war against Communistforces in Korea and a cold war against communism world-wide.Japan was obsessed with rebuilding its economy and regainingits sovereignty.</LP><TEXT>   In return for granting Japan its sovereignty, the U.S.wanted base rights and a mutual-security agreement with itsformer enemy. This horrified Japan's left-wingers, who wantedtheir country to pursue &quot;unarmed neutrality.&quot; The right wingwas willing to ally with the U.S. and even to rebuild Japan'smilitary to help the U.S. in Asia, but balked at the idea ofU.S. bases on Japanese soil.   Prime Minister Shigeru Yoshida set the course that Japanhas basically followed since. He accepted the U.S. bases, butonce the occupation ended he did everything he could toresist Washington's urgings to rapidly rebuild the Japanesemilitary. He was accused in Japan of being a member of the&quot;pro-Anglo-American clique,&quot; but rejoined: &quot;It would be morecorrect to speak of `the clique that makes use of Britain andthe United States.'&quot;   Mr. Yoshida calculated that American bases and a sort of&quot;dependent independence&quot; were the unavoidable price ofsovereignty. But he distrusted the Japanese military anddidn't think Japan could afford a military buildup. He wantedhis country to concentrate on industrial might.   The U.S., seeing Japan as the key to its military positionin Asia, was eager to encourage this industrial buildup. Itsent advisers to Japan to help control inflation and improveproduct quality, and it welcomed Japanese exports.   Within years, Japan's economy was booming. By the early1960s, some Japanese economic advisers were confident thatJapan could eventually become completely self-sufficient inmanufactured goods. When Caterpillar Inc. started a jointventure in Japan with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. in themid-1960s, it was startled to find that the Japanese couldbuild a factory twice as fast as Americans and use the plantto make products of the highest quality.   &quot;When we first came here we thought that everything wewere doing in the U.S. had to be right,&quot; says Keith Johnson,a Caterpillar man who worked on the joint venture's startupand now runs it. &quot;We learned in a hurry that wasn't right.&quot;   Through the 1950s and 1960s, most of the strains onU.S.-Japan relations were political. Pacifism was popular inpostwar Japan; the U.S.-Japan security treaty was a sorepoint. Satuski Eda, an opposition-party member of theJapanese Diet, vividly remembers leading fellow students fromTokyo University in demonstrations against the treaty'srenewal in 1960. Riots forced President Eisenhower to cancela planned trip to Japan. &quot;At the time,&quot; says Mr. Eda, &quot;somestrong criticism existed in Japan against the U.S.&quot;   By the early 1970s, political frictions were easing buteconomic tensions were building. A spat had developed overtextiles, the first of many nasty trade clashes that wouldpunctuate U.S.-Japan relations for the next 20 years. Steel,autos, machine tools, semiconductors -- again and again, theU.S. and Japan went to the mat.   Yet in most cases the U.S. was willing to accept Japaneseconcessions that stopped far short of damaging Japan'seconomic interests. Japan was still first and foremost asecurity partner, and, to Washington, it wasn't worthendangering the relationship for mere economic gain. Now,with the Cold War over, that logic no longer holds. &quot;Thesedays, power is defined more in economic terms than inmilitary terms,&quot; says Sen. Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat.The Japanese are &quot;trying to gain as much economic power asthey can. If we don't get with it, they might.&quot;   Now voices on both sides are suggesting the relationshipbetween the U.S. and Japan needs to be rethought. The twogovernments are groping for an alternative to militarysecurity that would keep the two countries close -- hence theBush administration's &quot;global partnership&quot; rhetoric. Butpublic opinion on both sides seems ready for more daringalternatives.   In the Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, half of allregistered American voters said Japan should stake out aforeign policy that is independent of the U.S. More and moreJapanese agree, though most still want a close relationshipwith the U.S. Asked to name their nation's closest ally, 79%of the Japanese responding to a Wall Street Journal-NipponResearch poll picked the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
