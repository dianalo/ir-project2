If they're right, the finding could revolutionize the treatmentof mental illness. Difficult and expensive psychotherapy could bereplaced with new drugs that would compensate for the genetic defect.   However, some geneticists say Dr. David Comings of the City ofHope National Medical Center and his wife, Brenda, are guilty of acolossal mistake or careless misuse of science.   An angry debate over their work erupted recently at the annualmeeting of the American Society of Human Genetics where DavidComings, president of the society this year, used his presidentialaddress to defend his findings.   He detailed behavioral disorders that he said occurred withunusually high frequency in relatives of those with Tourettesyndrome, including attention-deficit disorder, obsessive-compulsivebehavior, stuttering, dyslexia, multiple phobias, depression, maniaand severe anxiety, alcoholism, drug abuse and compulsive overeating.   David Pauls of Yale University presented similar research thatdirectly contradicted the Comings' findings. Pauls and hiscolleagues found no unusually high incidence of other disorders infamilies with Tourette syndrome.   After Pauls presented his data and responded to criticalquestions from David Comings, geneticists lingered to continue thediscussion. Not everyone at the genetics meeting was critical of theComingses' work. Some praised the pair for their courage inproposing such a daring hypothesis. Even their strongest criticsaccused them of no worse offense than shoddy science.   The Comingses based their conclusions on extensive studies offamilies of patients with Tourette syndrome, an inherited disordermarked by jerky movements, or tics, and uncontrollable vocalmannerisms including grunts, yelps, barks and sometimes involuntaryoutbursts of profanity.   They say Pauls doesn't see the connections because, unlike them,he doesn't treat patients with Tourette syndrome.   Pauls, a geneticist, says his studies included interviews withmany relatives of Tourette syndrome patients, while many of theComingses' studies were based on interviews with only patients andtheir parents.   Sue Levi, past president of the Tourette Syndrome Association inNew York City, said the association is spending $200,000 this yearto enable six labs in the United States and Europe to search for thegene, or a genetic marker that will indicate its approximatelocation on human chromosomes.</TEXT><HEAD>Family Builds Group To Fight Cancer After Son's Death</HEAD><DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   As Irving and Gertrude Swerdlow's son,Paul, died of cancer, they felt pain, then anger and bitterness, andfinally resolve.   ``When you lose your own child, you have a responsibility to seethat his life has not been totally wasted,'' said Gertrude Swerdlow.``You also have a responsibility to other parents.''   The Swerdlows started FACT, a grassroots organization aimed atraising public awareness of cancer and persuading the government andpublic to spend more fighting a disease that touches three out offour American families.   Like many Americans, they gave little thought about the extent ofcancer until their son, a 41-year-old physician in nuclear medicineand radiology, died from leukemia Feb. 28, 1985.   ``The things we saw made us very, very unhappy with ourselves andvery unhappy with the world we live in,'' said Irving Swerdlow.``Why don't we lick this thing, this cancer?''   FACT, which has grown to over 22,000 people in 18 states in 2{years, does not promote itself as a support group, but it has thateffect.   ``It wasn't until we learned about FACT that we realized weweren't as alone as we felt,'' said Gail Bouverat of Syracuse, whose17-year-old son Marc died in February, 22 months after beingdiagnosed with brain cancer. ``You know an individual doesn't getcancer, a family does.''   FACT's main purpose is to refute the idea that scientists arewinning the battle against cancer. That misperception has effectedfunding for groups like the National Cancer Institute and AmericanCancer Society.   ``The more the public understands cancer research and what ittakes to battle cancer, the better the chances we can conquer it,''said Dr. Peter Greenwald of the NCI in Bethesda, Md.</TEXT><HEAD>Earth's Climatological Past, Future Locked In Ice</HEAD><DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Chester Langway's laboratory holds six milesof ice that reveal volumes about Earth's past and, perhaps, itsfuture.   ``It's all there ... frozen in time,'' said Langway, whoseUniversity of Buffalo lab contains the nation's store of ice coresamples from Greenland and Antarctica _ a record of natural historystretching 150,000 years.   Ice, formed as layer after layer of snow fell and was compacted,provides a seasonal record more detailed than tree rings or seafloor sediments, he said.   Using techniques Langway pioneered, researchers have begunanalyzing ancient ice molecules. Oxygen isotopes record yearlytemperature variations. Dust levels show prehistoric volcanicactivity. Tiny bubbles of air give direct evidence of what theatmosphere was like thousands of years ago. The water that makes upthe ice can indicate natural levels of elements such as lead,cadmium, sulfur and chlorine, and can be used to gauge the effectindustrial activity.   Scientists have noted a sharp increase in carbon dioxide in thelast 150 years since the beginning of the industrial age, part ofthe debate about the ``greenhouse effect,'' global warming from thebuildup of heat-trapping gases from industrial emissions anddeforestation.   Changes in the level of carbon dioxide in the past have coincidedwith changes in the climate. Levels of the gas may even be part of amechanism that causes ice ages and global warming trends. There havebeen seven or eight times when the Earth's climate changeddrastically, with glaciers enveloping the continents and thenretreating, Langway explained.   Some scientists think the Earth may soon undergo a major climatechange brought on by pollution. They have developed computer modelsshowing disastrous consequences such as droughts and rising oceanlevels over the next 50 years.   Langway, however, is emphatic about not drawing conclusions forthe future from current ice core research. ``You can speculate likehell, but we just haven't done enough research to have all theanswers.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Dec. 1</NOTE></DOC>
