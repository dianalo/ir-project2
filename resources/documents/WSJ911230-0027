As the European Community's commissioner for environmentalpolicy, he talks passionately about the need to steer societyaway from a &quot;suicidal&quot; habit of tolerating pollution. And hewants the EC to set an example for the world: &quot;The EC,&quot; hedeclares, &quot;should be an environmental superpower.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   For now, though, the EC is an environmental weakling.   Despite the Italian commissioner's pleas, the community'snew union treaty gives only a minor increase in power to ECenvironmental policy makers. Legislation generally will stillneed unanimous approval from the 12 member countries -- asituation that breeds watered-down laws adopted after longdelays.   As a result, the community's greener members -- Germany,the Netherlands and Denmark -- are likely to continuesprinting ahead with their own tough but often incompatiblelegislation. Southern Europe probably will continue laggingbehind.   Moreover, the EC commission has only a tiny staff toprepare legislation and monitor the environment. To providemore expertise, EC members agreed in 1990 to set up anenvironmental agency. But petty politics have prevented theagency from opening: Members can't agree where it will bebased.   Although the EC has managed to enact reams ofenvironmental rules, the commission has little power toenforce them. Violations abound.   &quot;Overall, progress and prospects leave much to bedesired,&quot; the commission's environmental service said in arecent report. Most European countries still lag well behindthe U.S. on environmental protection standards.   Water quality is one of the biggest worries. Thecommission says fertilizer and manure have pushed the levelof nitrates in ground water to dangerous levels in many ECregions, despite an EC directive aimed at reducing suchpollution. A recent study found that the level of nitrates inground water one meter below the surface violated ECstandards on 25% of all farm land in the EC; the amount ofpesticides was too high on 65% of EC farm land.   Another concern is that the EC -- whose population densityis more than five times that of the U.S. -- has an acuteshortage of space to bury, burn or otherwise treat theestimated 2.2 billion metric tons of waste created annually(a metric ton is equal to 2,204.62 pounds). Efforts torecycle household waste are still in their infancy.   &quot;We have largely defigured our heritage -- our towns, ourcoastlines, our Alps,&quot; says Mr. Ripa di Meana, a formerjournalist and socialist politician who became the EC'senvironmental chief three years ago.   Further wounds are likely. The EC's progress in creating aunified market is expected to spur both trade and trafficacross borders. By some estimates, crossborder transport ofgoods will double by the year 2000. That means more exhaustfumes and more waste. A unified market also makes it easierfor businesses to move production to countries whereenvironmental rules and enforcement are weaker. To avoid suchenvironmental &quot;dumping,&quot; the commission wants to harmonizeregulations as much as possible.   Mr. Ripa di Meana hoped the union treaty signed earlierthis month in Maastricht would give a big boost to suchefforts. He was disappointed.   The treaty does provide for majority voting, rather thanunanimity, to pass some types of environmental legislation.However, caving in to pressure from member states worriedabout cleanup costs or loss of sovereignty, the treaty'sauthors allowed a long list of exceptions. Unanimity stillwill be required for measures involving town and countryplanning, land use and water resources, as well aslegislation significantly affecting a nation's energy supplyor primarily concerned with taxes. A spokesman for Mr. Ripadi Meana says the treaty will make little difference inspeeding environmental legislation.   One area in which the community may be able to use thequicker majority-voting route is in waste management. But anyspeeding up in that area comes too late to head off a splitwithin the community over how to deal with packaging waste.While the EC is still trying to come up with a packagingdirective, Germany, among others, already has begun puttingits own packaging plan into effect.   The German packaging law requires companies to arrange fora way of recycling or reusing most of the packages they useto sell goods. Many foreign businessmen regard the system ascumbersome and unfair. What they want is a uniform programfor all EC countries.   Some environmentalists question whether it is healthy topursue EC-wide policies rather than national ones. AnitaFokkema, who works for Greenpeace in Brussels, says the realrisk is that the EC will hold back progress in the greenerstates and impose the lowest common denominator among the 12members.   Businessmen, however, generally want more uniformity inregulations to make cross-border trade simpler. In any case,a large degree of international cooperation is generallyconsidered vital.   Because the EC's environmental staff is so small, it hasto rely heavily for help in preparing legislation on outsideconsultants that sometimes have links with industries beingregulated. Critics say the staff sometimes relies too heavilyon such consultants. The staff also finds it impossible tomonitor whether member states are putting EC environmentallaws into effect and enforcing them properly. For the mostpart, the commission relies on the public to complain whenmember states run afoul of the EC rules. But the publicdoesn't always know what the rules are.   Even so, the commission has pursued noncompliancecomplaints against all 12 members over the years, most oftenagainst Belgium, Greece, Italy and Spain. But the Institutefor European Environmental Policy, a think tank, said thatcases in which the EC takes action are only &quot;the tip of theiceberg.&quot;   If a member state ignores warnings over noncompliance withEC law, the commission can take the matter to the EuropeanCourt of Justice, a process that usually takes years. Even ifthe court finds that the member has failed to apply EC law,however, there is no penalty.   Once the new union treaty is ratified, the commission willgain a little more leverage in such cases. If a member stateis brought to the European Court a second time for failing toapply the same EC law, the court could impose a fine.   By that time, however, the environmental damage may wellhave been done. Thus, Mr. Ripa di Meana argues that thecommission needs power to investigate environmental abusesand levy fines promptly. &quot;We have to carry a stick,&quot; he says.But given the EC's gradual approach toward politicalintegration, Mr. Ripa di Meana is unlikely to brandish thatstick anytime soon.</TEXT></DOC>
