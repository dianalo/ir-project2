It sounds like a natural.    The trouble is, this movie is in Lapp. And since there are only about 40,000 Lapps in the world -- some of whom need snow shoes to reach the nearest theater -- the picture wouldn't seem to have mass appeal.    But in the movie business, anything is possible. So &quot;Pathfinder,&quot; which is said to be the first full-length feature film ever made in this obscure northern European tongue, is set for world-wide release.    &quot;In Lapp?&quot; asks Michael Eisner, the chairman of Walt Disney Co. &quot;Like in Lap-land? Does it have Barbra Streisand?&quot;    Actually, the only big star is an Icelandic matinee idol, Helgi Skulason, who plays the heavy. And, of all companies, Carolco Pictures Inc. has acquired the film's rights. These are the people who brought us &quot;Rambo.&quot;    Perhaps stranger still -- given the fact that the film was made for a relative pittance by a bunch of unknowns in a dying language under terrifyingly harsh conditions -- &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is exactly the kind of slick, riveting suspense picture Hollywood loves.    Written and directed by Nils Gaup, a 32-year-old Lapp actor who had never made a movie, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; and the Sylvester Stallone epics have certain things in common. Both present good and evil in stark contrast, and both have courageous heroes.    But Mr. Stallone reportedly was paid $16 million for &quot;Rambo III,&quot; which is nearing completion. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was made for a total of $3 million, a sum that would bring guffaws at the Polo Lounge since the average major-studio production costs six times that.    Like the Rambo pictures, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is a smash -- but only in Norway, where it has grossed $4 million since Sept. 30. That's a lot of money in a nation of 4.1 million people and $4.50 movie tickets. &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is Norway's entry in this year's Academy Awards competition for best foreign film.    Besides making big bucks in Oslo, the picture has heightened Norwegian awareness of the Lapps, who see themselves as the American Indians of Scandinavia. &quot;Suddenly,&quot; says producer John M. Jacobsen, &quot;Lapp is in.&quot;    For years, Lapps have struggled to maintain their identity and way of life against the encroachment of time and technology. They have survived official repression, summer tourists, and the pernicious effects of television and alcohol.    And, in April 1986, they survived the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, which sent radioactive fallout drifting over Lapp grazing lands, contaminating the Lapps' reindeer and ruining the market for reindeer meat.    But today most Lapps, who live in Norway, Sweden, Finland and the Soviet Union, no longer subsist on hunting, fishing and herding. Only a few cling to the old ways.    The Lapps, whose name for themselves is Saami, speak a language belonging to the Finno-Ugric group, which includes Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian. Even in Norway, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; required subtitles. Nevertheless, Carolco has high hopes for the picture, described by a critic in the trade paper Variety as &quot;a job of epic actioner film making to rank with the best of any country.&quot; The Norwegian critical establishment was equally enthusiastic.    Based on a legend Mr. Gaup says he heard as a youngster, &quot;Pathfinder&quot; is the story of a Lapp teen-ager 1,000 years ago whose family is wiped out by a band of marauders called Tsjude.    The boy narrowly escapes, finding refuge in a bigger Lapp camp, but he is reviled by some because the Tsjudes might follow his tracks. The peace-loving Lapps decide to flee, but the boy wants to stay and fight. Eventually he falls into the hands of the Tsjudes, who force him to lead them to the Lapp community on the coast. His challenge is to save himself and avenge the killings without betraying his people.    Making and selling a Lapp film isn't easy. During the shooting high above the Arctic Circle, the temperature was 40 degrees below zero, and for a while there were only two hours of daylight in which to work.    &quot;Everything froze,&quot; recalls Mr. Jacobsen, the producer. &quot;We had engine heaters on the cars. You could start them, but the steering froze, so you could only drive them straight.&quot; Eventually the crew just left the cars and heaters running 24 hours a day.    Cameras had to be stored in a freezer. Otherwise, when they were taken indoors, condensation would develop inside the mechanisms, then freeze later, ruining the equipment. Crews also battled brittle film, which tends to crack in the cold, and recalcitrant sound equipment, which had to be defrosted with electric hair dryers. The first stunt consultant brought in from England couldn't take the cold and left almost immediately.    The two-hour drive from the filming location to the nearest airport took crew members through terrain so cold and deserted that the daily trip to send off exposed film was made in two cars: one to carry the reel and another to keep anybody from dying in case of car trouble.    Like other neophytes, Mr. Gaup had a hard time getting potential backers to read his script at first. &quot;People said, 'Are you crazy?'&quot; he recalls. Eventually, however, the Norwegian government put up half the money he needed, investors the rest. He rounded up an amateur Lapp theater troupe to act in the film and hired professionals from Norway and Iceland to play the evil Tsjudes.    Mr. Jacobsen feels fortunate to have his film seen around the world. &quot;If somebody came into Paramount to make this movie, in a language nobody speaks, with no big names, they'd probably throw you out,&quot; he says.    Carolco came upon the film because the first Rambo picture had been distributed in Norway by a company Mr. Jacobsen owned. In legendary Hollywood fashion, Rocco Viglietta, Carolco's executive vice president for sales, says he made a deal for the picture based on a trailer without subtitles.    &quot;I had no idea what was going on,&quot; says Mr. Viglietta, who comes from the Bronx and doesn't know from Lapp. &quot;But both Guy East and I realized there was something there.&quot;    Mr. East, the managing director of Carolco Films International Ltd., had just joined the company, and &quot;Pathfinder&quot; was the first movie he bought for his new employer. When he excitedly called company headquarters in Los Angeles to announce his coup, &quot;They said, 'Where's Lapland?'&quot; he recalls.    Mr. Viglietta says that in exchange for a guaranteed minimum of less than $500,000 plus a percentage, Carolco acquired world-wide rights to the film outside Scandinavia. Distributors have already been lined up in most of Europe, and the company is negotiating with potential U.S. distributors, Mr. East says.    Even if the film flops elsewhere, Mr. Gaup is happy with its success in Norway, where most Lapps live.    &quot;When I was young, people told me these stories&quot; of the &quot;Pathfinder&quot; legend, he says. &quot;But when television came, people forgot.&quot; Mr. Gaup, whose English is fluent, is distressed that the traditional ways are disappearing and that the Lapp language is dying.    &quot;The people are leaving the culture,&quot; he says. &quot;We made 'Pathfinder' to try to keep the culture living.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
