 I really did not know what I was doing; I was taughtonly the mechanics of how to write software.andP;  Later on, I learned theconcepts and, as a result, was able to write much better software.andM;I learned well because it was my job, but today there are a lot of lay peoplewho still do not understand software.andP;  A few years ago my neighbor, a famousState Department news correspondent with NBC, leaned over the side fence andasked me if computer programs were anything like TV programs.andP;  I felt likesaying, &quot;Yeah, there are some good ones and some bad ones.&quot;andM;At a recent interview, Peter Lynch, who heads the largest mutual fund in theworld, admitted he does not understand software and that is why he invests inpantyhose.andM;Ladies and gentlemen, it is about time you all understood software becauseits effects are pervasive in our lives.andP;  It took me 30 years in the businessto understand software and I feel eminently qualified to explain it.andP;  But Ifeel computer people need ways to explain software that lay people canunderstand.andP;

 It does not just work one hour a week.andP;  It issupposed to work all the time.andM;* Software is like getting married.andP;  It takes a long time to make a ralcommitment to get on withit.andM;* Software is like a garden.andP;  It takes some effort to prepare; it has to bedeveloped and cared for with watering, feeding and maintenance.andP;  And then atharvest time you better hope that everyone in the family really likeszucchini because it is too late to go back and plant strawberries.andM;* Software is like a malfunctioning automobile.andP;  It never malfunctions whenthe repairman is looking.andM;* Software is like a leaky roof.andP;  The problem is not where the drip is.andM;* Software is like a new appliance.andP;  Quality control begins in your home.andM;* Software is like a credit check at the cashier.andP;
