IBM said the experimental circuits could switch on and off 75billion times a second, twice as fast as the fastest silicontransistors known to date.   The extra speed was made possible by shrinking the circuit partsdown to a tenth of a micron across, which is one-thousandth thewidth of a human hair and only a few hundred atoms wide.   The company cautioned that complex problems remain to be solvedbefore entire chips can be made that take full advantage of theexperimental transistors.   IBM's advance helps close the speed gap between silicon andgallium arsenide, another kind of semiconducting material that isfaster than silicon but more expensive and harder to work with.   The fastest gallium arsenide circuits can switch on and offabout 200 billion times a second, IBM said.</TEXT></DOC>
