With the nomination in deep trouble, senators like Republicans Cohen, Chafee and Hatfield and Democrats Heflin, Nunn, Boren and Chiles hold the key. Civil-rights forces, influential with both groups, keep up intense pressure. Meanwhile, Reagan begins calling senators personally, and advisers urge him to publicly speak about the nomination almost daily.    Deputy chief of staff Duberstein assembles a group of private lobbyists to augment official efforts. White House conservatives want Reagan to link opposition to Bork with support for abortion and pornography, but one says that tough attacks now come &quot;eight weeks too late.&quot; Right-wing critics already begin laying blame at staff chief Baker's door.    Hoping to make it harder for Heflin to oppose confirmation, the administration plants reports that he could be its next nominee if Bork goes down.    IRAQI RESTRAINT is sought by U.S. officials -- without success.    The Reagan administration presses Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Bahrain -- all Iraqi allies -- to plead for Baghdad to ease attacks on Iranian shipping. U.S. military strategists contend that Iraq could do better militarily if it attacked land-based refineries, pipelines and processing facilities, and left shipping alone.    But the Iraqis show no desire to take heed. While the U.S. wants to scale down its presence in the Gulf, Iraq wants to keep Americans engaged -- and the stepped-up shipping attacks could provoke an Iranian retaliation that drags the U.S. still deeper into the war. &quot;American interests don't coincide with Iraq's interests,&quot; says James Placke, a former Reagan State Department official.    REAGAN'S DEFENSE PLANS will suffer from deficit-cutting efforts.    Even if he accepts a $12 billion tax increase from Congress, he is likely to see defense spending held at last year's level, more than $20 billion below his request. And if he doesn't accept more taxes, Gramm-Rudman's automatic cuts will cause defense spending to fall an additional $10 billion.    Some administration officials are betting that Reagan will hold to his no-tax stance, let defense spending fall and bash the Democrats. But others think a &quot;package of nuts and bolts can be put together&quot; that he would accept. The White House isn't tipping its hand, hoping to keep maximum pressure on Congress.    GOP Sen. Packwood says Congress will let the automatic cuts kick in rather than send Reagan a tax bill he would veto: &quot;He's in the position to call the shot on this.&quot;    WALSH MULLS a two-tier strategy for Iran-Contra criminal charges. Facing long delays in obtaining key data from Switzerland and Israel, the special prosecutor considers a relatively narrow round of indictments alleging obstruction of justice, misleading Congress and related charges. Broader conspiracy and fraud charges might come later.    SIMON STANDS to benefit from Dukakis's embarrassment over his aides' role in bringing down Biden. Liberal activists disillusioned with Dukakis's handling of the affair could find Simon's camp ideologically comfortable. &quot;Simon is the sleeper in all this,&quot; says one party leader.    CAMPAIGN SUMMIT: The heads of the six Democratic presidential campaigns plan a meeting next week to try to control the proliferation of candidate debates. Campaign officials, led by Jackson and Dukakis aides, complain that there are too many debates and that they unduly magnify certain issues.    THE BORK BATTLE pushes planned civil-rights legislation affecting housing and expanding the scope of federal anti-discrimination rules onto the back burner. With the Senate back in Democratic hands, civil-rights groups had hoped for passage of the long-stalled bills this year. But activist Ralph Neas says &quot;everybody realizes&quot; that Bork &quot;has to take priority.&quot;    MOST GOP CANDIDATES march to Reagan's right on national-security issues.    Kemp, Robertson, DuPont and Haig all stake out hard-line positions as they jostle for support from the party's dominant conservative wing. Despite polls showing most Americans approve of arms accords and oppose Contra aid, the candidates criticize the pending intermediate-range nuclear-arms accord with the Soviets and what they see as Reagan's softening on Central America.    Only Bush remains firmly supportive of Reagan's foreign-policy moves. Dole straddles the fence but moves more and more toward the right; he stresses the need for &quot;airtight&quot; verification of the INF accord. The candidates' move rightward heartens conservative activists, who have grown deeply disillusioned with Reagan on foreign policy.    &quot;Saying he {Reagan} is irrelevant is probably a good description of the situation,&quot; says James Hackett of the conservative Heritage Foundation.    MINOR MEMOS: On sale at this week's World Bank meeting: a $12.95 World Bank Cookbook featuring such dishes as Canadian lettuce soup. . . . &quot;I don't think about being president any more,&quot; Sen. Kennedy tells a union conference. &quot;I don't think about it any less, either.&quot; . . . Gephardt receives a $1,000 contribution from Chrysler chief Iacocca. . . . Democratic strategist Kirk O'Donnell jokes that Reagan isn't doing anything about the deficit because &quot;he says it's big enough to take care of itself.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
