Ronald Reagan, in one of his last acts as president last week,authorized American oil companies to resume doing business in Libyain a bid to head off the potential nationalization of their hugeinvestment in that country.   The move also was designed to end what was called the significantwindfall profits Libya has reaped since the Reagan administrationimposed the ban on the U.S. operations there in 1986.   In the absence of the American companies, Libyans have beenworking the U.S. oil fields and keeping the income.   ``Obviously, it did not help that for 2{ years we have beenunable to be in Libya, where we have a one-sixth interest in theOasis Oil Co. Those were profits lost,'' Herring said.   He said he did not have any figures on how much money Marathon, asubsidiary of Pittsburgh-based USX Corp., lost during the sanctions.Marathon is based in Findlay, Ohio, about 45 miles south of Toledoin northwest Ohio.   ``We have said that we would welcome a return to our Libyanoperation if government approval was forthcoming,'' he said. ``Itappears that it is.''   State Department spokesman Charles Redman has said theannouncement will permit the oil companies to resume theiroperations in Libya, transfer operations to foreign subsidiaries orsell their assets if they so desire.   Other affected companies are Occidential Petroleum, ConocoPetroleum, W. R. Grace and Amerada Hess. Their investments in Libyaare believed to total in the hundreds of millions of dollars.   Before the embargo went into effect, Libya received 51 percent ofthe revenues derived from the U.S. oil operations.   When the administration imposed broad trade sanctions againstLibya in 1986, it authorized the companies to negotiate``standstill'' agreements with Libya.   The agreements, which expire June 30, provided for the suspensionof company operations to protect the companies from charges ofdefault on their contractual obligations to work their concessionsin Libya.   The companies have been concerned that Libyan leader MoammarGadhafi might seize their assets if the agreement expires and thesanctions are not lifted.</TEXT></DOC>
