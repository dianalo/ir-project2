The association also announced a $9-million benefits package forEastern pilots honoring a machinists union walkout.   Eastern is running only a small fraction of its more than 1,000daily flights, and officials have said they plan to scale down theairline, possibly selling off such assets as planes and routes toother carriers.   A $365 million sale of the airline's Northeast shuttle operationsto New York developer Donald Trump was pending before the strike. Itawaits approval of the Federal Aviation Administration, which mustdetermine whether Trump can operate the airline safely, and of thebankruptcy court in New York.   Eastern filed for protection under bankruptcy laws last Thursday,which was payday, and the unions have appealed to the bankruptcyjudge to release their pay.   Henry Duffy, pilots association president, said member pilotsfrom 47 airlines would be assessed an average of $300 a month tosupport the Eastern pilots and the union would draw from its$37-million strike fund as the money is collected.   ``All 41,000 pilots will reach deep into their pockets to helpthe Eastern pilots who are reaching deep within themselves to copewith the personal and professional risks of their action,'' Duffysaid at a news conference as the strike entered its 11th day.   He said the union's executive board also approved during aday-long meeting Monday interest-free loans for Eastern crews,including $2,000 for captains, $1,500 for first officers and $1,200for second officers, to replace March 15 paychecks which the companywill not issue because it has filed for protection under bankruptylaws.   The pilots were also appealing to the bankruptcy court to appointa trustee other than Texas Air Corp. head Frank Lorenzo to overseeEastern Airlines business during bankruptcy proceedings.   John Bavis, chairman of the striking Eastern pilot group, saidthe union's monthly payments would amount to less than half ofairline pilots' regular salaries but would help them meet mortgagepayments and buy groceries.   ``Despite management's claim, we haven't cracked, we haven'tgiven in,'' Bavis said. He said less than 2 percent of Eastern's3,600 union pilots had crossed picket lines. He estimated thatmanagement was operating with fewer than 200 pilots, many of whom hesaid have already worked the maximum 100 hours a month allowed bythe Federal Aviation Administration.   Bavis said Eastern pilots are continuing talks with management inhopes of resolving their own contract.   John Mazor, union spokesman, said the union has given financialsupport to pilots in previous strikes but has never put togethersuch an extensive package of payments, loans and other action.   Mazor said Eastern has been able to expand operations slightly inrecent days because it finally has been able to deploy more of itsmanagement pilots, not because of union defections. He said thatalthough a few union pilots have crossed the lines, more from theother side have joined the walkout, resulting in a net loss ofpilots available to the airline.   Mazor acknowledged that a directive last week for union pilots ofall the nation's airlines to follow the most time-consuming safeflying procedures did not result in significant delays at airports.   He said about 60 percent of pilots were following the proceduresand he expected many to continue. But Mazor said there were no plansto either repeat or rescind the notice which had been intended as ashow of support for Eastern pilots.   The Air Transport Association, representing the nation's majorairlines, had urged the pilots not to follow the directive which itcharacterized as a ``slowdown order.''</TEXT></DOC>
