<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-72-0843 </DOCNO><TEXT>Downhole measuring apparatus includes a gamma radiation source and atleast two pairs of radiation detectors carried by a housing so that radiationmay be emitted from the source and scattered by the environment of thehousing and detected by the detectors. Each pair of detectors is arrangedso that its detectors are positioned symmetrically on opposite sidesof the longitudinal axis of the housing, and each pair of detectors,in combination with the radiation source, forms a different geometricalconfiguration so that, in general, the radiation counts obtained by thedifferent pairs of detectors will not be redundant. The output signalsfrom the detectors may be processed to provide data signals indicativeof the radiation counts experienced by the detectors, and which may thenbe used to simultaneously obtain values for two or more downhole parameters.The addition of each new, independent pair of detectors permits the simultaneoussolution of an additional downhole parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
