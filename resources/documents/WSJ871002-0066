The National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting, in its final report, said the SEC should be given statutory authority to temporarily suspend or permanently bar corporate officers and directors from official posts in a public company if they are involved with fraudulent financial reporting. Fraudulent action would be determined by the courts and law enforcement or SEC investigations.    The SEC currently has the power to suspend or permanently bar officers and employees in the securities industry and can also act against public accountants. But the SEC rarely has been able to take such action against officials in public companies, and only with the official's consent, because the SEC lacks statutory authority in this area.    James C. Treadway Jr., chairman of the fraud commission and a former SEC commissioner, said that surveys taken by the commission show &quot;The public is as upset with fraudulent financial reporting as it is with insider trading.&quot; In an interview, he added, &quot;Stronger deterrents are needed within corporations to prevent fraudulent financial reporting.&quot;    The fraud commission was organized in 1985 by five accounting and business organizations following a rising tide of lawsuits alleging financial fraud against accounting firms and public companies. U.S. Rep. Ronald Wyden (D., Ore.), a member of a House oversight subcommittee that has been investigating financial fraud, said he is considering introducing legislation to implement the fraud commission's recommendations.    In its final report, the panel backed off its earlier recommendations that the audit committee of a corporate board be given approval power in two key areas.    One recommendation would have given the audit committee approval power over a company's quarterly financial results. The other would have given the committee the right to approve in advance the amount of consulting work done by the company's outside auditor.    The final report recommends only that the audit committee &quot;oversee&quot; or &quot;review&quot; management's decisions in these two areas. Rep. Wyden said the commission should have stayed with its original stronger recommendations.    In an interview, Mr. Treadway said, &quot;We didn't back away from the audit committee monitoring independence in an oversight capacity. But many in business and accounting said it would be impractical for the company to get advance approval of each and every consulting engagement by its outside auditors, regardless of how small.&quot;    The fraud commission also recommended that companies be required to disclose all their accounting discussions with the previous auditor after the companies change auditors. And it urged that outside auditors review quarterly financial results prior to their issuance, rather than afterward, as is the current practice.    The Financial Executives Institute, which represents corporate financial officers, opposes forcing companies to disclose all accounting matters with previous accountants after changing auditors. &quot;Disclosing everything the company has discussed with the previous auditor is overkill,&quot; said Burton E. Broome, a member of the institute's committee on corporate reporting.    Mr. Broome, vice president and controller of Transamerica Corp., San Francisco, said departing auditors should only disclose material disagreements with company management. </TEXT></DOC>
