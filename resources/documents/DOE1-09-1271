<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-1271 </DOCNO><TEXT>Some basic properties of emerged magnetic flux concentrations are examinedwith emphasis on the interplay between the magnetic and thermodynamicstructure in the region between the photosphere and the transition zone.The discussion is limited to the gross behavior of those phenomena thatmay be reasonably regarded as quasi-static, such as the longer-livedsunspots, pores, and some smaller magnetic flux tubes. Substructure anddynamic phenomena are not considered.</TEXT></DOC>
