Administration officials were caught by surprise by Monday's panicky market reaction to the tariffs on Japan. Insiders say the incident is likely to leave policy makers more cautious about using &quot;tough-sounding&quot; retaliatory measures, even though the markets eventually regained some ground.    The administration moves to use the turmoil and subsequent rise in the prime rate to argue against tough trade legislation. Treasury chief Baker tells Capitol Hill the stock-market slide showed that investors don't want protectionism. The reaction increases pressure on House Democrats pushing a tough bill.    &quot;The market's roller-coaster tendencies make us in Congress all the more apprehensive,&quot; says Democratic Rep. Pease. &quot;We are walking on eggs.&quot;    REPUBLICANS PRESS for a new Contra policy, but will Reagan respond?    Despite administration tough talk about seeking a Contra-aid increase next year, Reagan's position erodes with GOP supporters. Sens. Kassebaum, Cohen and Rudman warn that they may withdraw their support unless he shows more interest in a diplomatic solution. Sen. McCain says that &quot;we have to refocus our support not for the overthrow of the government but for a free election in Nicaragua.&quot;    Baker and Carlucci seem amenable, but Reagan so far shows little interest. Moreover, such ploys have been used before, making legislators insistent on action. And any real commitment could open divisions within the GOP, where conservatives have been building toward a clear-cut vote that would either grant the aid or force Democrats to live with the consequences.    PRESSURE GROWS for an international conference on Mideast peace.    U.S. officials suggest the greater pace of Soviet Jewish emigration may be designed in part to make it more difficult for Israeli Prime Minister Shamir to oppose such a conference, which would include the Russians. The Soviets &quot;will only let those people go for calculated political effect,&quot; says a senior U.S. official.    The possible resumption of Soviet-Israeli consular relations adds to the pressure for a Soviet role. Jordan's Hussein also pushes for a conference; despite qualms, the U.S. is willing to go along. But officials disagree with Moscow's desire to use the U.N. Security Council as an opening forum.    The U.S. would accept the Soviets in an umbrella conference that would open talks, but it doesn't want to let them into negotiating sessions.    GADHAFI'S SETBACKS in Chad embolden some U.S. policy makers. &quot;We are witnessing the withering away&quot; of the Libyan dictator, one senior official gloats. But officials concede that they have underestimated his ability to rebound in the past and that his terror apparatus remains.    SPREADING IT AROUND: The National Association of Broadcasters paid no fewer than 42 members of Congress to attend its recent Dallas convention. Besides air fare and expenses, seven senators got honorariums of $2,000 each, while 35 representatives got $1,500 apiece. For the most part, the legislators gave mini-speeches and answered questions at panel discussions.    DEAVER DEPARTS from Reagan's presidential-library foundation. The former White House aide's resignation as a trustee and governor, effective April 1, was submitted a few days before his indictment on perjury charges last month. Some affiliated with the foundation wanted him out; he told other trustees that he no longer had the time to devote to it.    POLITICAL DAMAGE from the &quot;PearlyGate&quot; scandal may spread beyond Robertson and Falwell. Religious Right leaders fear less interest in grass-roots secular politics like school-board elections; activists are less likely to be &quot;cooperating together in the political realm, because they're fighting each other over the religious one,&quot; says political consultant Gary Jarmin.    REPLACING WEBSTER at the FBI proves a difficult task.    Administration officials had hoped for a successor by now, but early top contenders have dropped out. Federal Judges William Wilkins and Peter Fay are among those still in the running, but Meese has yet to send a final list of names to Reagan. Despite Webster's Capitol Hill popularity, his successor will face difficult policy and budget issues and stepped-up congressional scrutiny.    Officials say increased drug and espionage investigations have sapped manpower from bank fraud, defense procurement and other white-collar crime cases. The proposed merger of the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration poses thorny management and personnel problems. A likely push for tougher efforts to oust corrupt local union officials may stir criticism from labor's allies in Congress.    Another goal of some lawmakers: tighter curbs on Abscam-style undercover investigations.    MINOR MEMOS: Deputy Treasury Secretary Darman delays announcing his resignation by one day; he didn't want to quit on April Fool's Day. . . . The 13 GOP senators targeted by the White House's unsuccessful effort to sustain Reagan's highway-bill veto quickly became known as &quot;Baker's Dozen.&quot; . . . When an odiferous blaze disrupts a House Government Operations hearing, Rep. Wise tells stogie-loving Chairman Brooks: &quot;Let the record show the fire smells better than your cigar.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
