Aron currency and commodities division of Goldman, Sachs andamp;Co.   &quot;People are trying to be as clever as possible to get outof their positions,&quot; he said. Rather than selling a positionall at once and hammering the price, Mr. Riley said,speculators are trying to sell a little at a time.   There was also renewed selling by Japanese investorsovernight, which caused platinum to open weakly in New York,said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist at MerrillLynch.   The Soviet Union is a major producer of platinum.Initially on Monday, traders feared that supplies would bedisrupted. Later on Monday, and also on Tuesday, platinumbegan to fall on fears that the country would sell itssupplies if it lost Western economic aid.   Despite Gorbachev's return to power, the threat of goldand platinum sales by the Soviet Union remains, Mr. O'Neillsaid. The country still needs to raise hard currency to buyfood and other products, he said. In addition, the individualrepublics may also sell metals to raise cash, he said.   Industrial and investment demand for platinum are weakbecause the U.S. economy remains sluggish and the U.S.inflation rate is low, he said. Platinum is used heavily inautomobile catalytic converters. And precious metals areviewed by some investors as inflation hedges.   Even bullish news yesterday morning -- a major SouthAfrican producer announced it was shutting two platinumfacilities because of a labor dispute -- did little to stemthe decline in platinum prices, he noted.   Michael Segal, senior futures strategist at GeldermannInc., said there was also selling by investors who had boughtplatinum when the metal first dipped to price parity withgold. Platinum, which usually trades at a premium to gold,now is nearly $20 an ounce lower than gold.   And some people think platinum prices still have furtherto fall before hitting bottom. Mr. O'Neill said platinum willfind initial support at $325, a level he thinks the marketwill reach within a few weeks.   But Mr. Riley said some people think solid support forplatinum won't be found until it reaches $250.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND LIVESTOCK: Euphoria over the failed coup in theSoviet Union continued to reverberate through the farmfutures markets. Grain prices jumped on speculation that theWhite House might allow Moscow early access to food-buyingcredit guarantees that aren't slated to become availableuntil October. A few days before the coup attempt, Sovietofficials requested that at least some of $900 million inunused export credit guarantees be made available at anearlier date. Grain traders are speculating that the WhiteHouse might look more favorably on that request now that theSoviet Union has turned back the right-wing coup. Livestockprices also rose in part on reasoning that Moscow might useany aid to purchase U.S. meat as well as grains. Graintraders are continuing to speculate that several Westerngovernments might increase economic assistance to the SovietUnion. Grain prices were also supported by forecasts for dryand hot weather in the Midwest, where the corn crop hasalready been stunted by a scattered drought. At the ChicagoBoard of Trade, the corn contract for September delivery roseseven cents a bushel to settle at $2.505 a bushel. Thesoybean contract for September delivery rose nine cents abushel to settle at $5.7125 a bushel. Prices of pork-bellyfutures contracts rose the daily permissible limit of twocents a pound on speculation that the hog slaughter will slowfor several weeks, increasing the demand by processors toacquire pork bellies from frozen storage. A pork belly isused to make bacon.                                                                                                          ENERGY: Crude oil futures finished 17 cents a barrelhigher in a session that was decidedly more calm than inprevious trading days, when the market was driven by newsfrom the Soviet Union. On the New York Mercantile Exchange,October crude settled at $21.72 a barrel. November crudegained 14 cents a barrel and other months were higher aswell. Some market participants were a bit surprised thatyesterday's session didn't see some continuation ofWednesday's sell-off, brought on by the end of theshort-lived coup attempt in the Soviet Union. Some of crude'sstrength was attributed to statistics from the AmericanPetroleum Institute -- out Tuesday, but overshadowed by theSoviet events -- showing low gasoline inventories, especiallyon the East Coast.                                                                                                          COCOA: Futures prices continued to rise. Cocoa forSeptember delivery ended $31 a ton higher at $1,020. Theactively traded December contract rose $23 a ton to $1,072.Cocoa could have been hurt by a prolonged Soviet coup, saidHarri Schwartz, an analyst at Cargill Investor Services,because the country is an important consumer. Worries thatthe internal upheaval might keep the Soviets out of the cocoamarket caused prices to plummet on Monday, with Decembercocoa falling $61. Traders' attention now has returned to thepossibility that cocoa production will fall short of demandthis year, the first deficit in eight years, he said. Butofficial estimates aren't due for several weeks and untilthen, traders will be nervous and prices erratic, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
