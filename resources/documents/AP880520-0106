Shultz said todaythat the United States and the Soviet Union plan to agree at theMoscow summit on a program of notification of each others'ballistic missile tests.   The agreement was to have been a minor part of an overall planthe superpowers had hoped to reach reducing strategic, orlong-range, nuclear forces by up to 50 percent _ a so-called STARTpact.   Though the two sides have failed to reach that sweepingagreement, Shultz said, they have developed ``similar language'' onmissile-testing notification _ a program designed to boostconfidence that tests are not a prelude to war.   ``It's something that conceivably could be lifted out of that(the START agreement) and signed separately and it would not be abig deal, but an additional confidence-building measure,'' Shultzsaid in a satellite news conference with reporters in Europe andCanada.   In addition, President Reagan and Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev are likely to issue a statement outlining other areas ofprogress they have made toward the unrealized START agreement,Shultz said.   In Moscow, meanwhile, a Soviet spokesman said in an interviewpublished today that the two sides will include land-based mobilemissiles in their negotiations on a treaty to reduce strategicnuclear weapons.   ``We have every reason to believe that the problem of mobilemissiles will be resolved,'' Col. Gen. Nikolai Chervov, SovietDefense Ministry spokesman, told The Washington Post.   ``We are now coordinating positions on this in Geneva,'' whereU.S.-Soviet arms talks are under way, Chervov said in an interviewin Moscow.   Chervov said the United States appeared to be moving away fromits demand for a ban on such missiles now that the Pentagon plansto base MX missiles on railroad cars.   An American official in Moscow said that there had been nochange in U.S. policy but that the United States has said it iswilling to negotiate on ways to verify an agreement which wouldallow both sides to deploy mobile missiles.   The official was not named. The Reagan administration hasrejected Soviet proposals to include mobile missiles in a STARTaccord because of verification problems.   Chervov said U.S. officials have presented ideas in Geneva onhow to verify limits on mobile missiles after earlier seeking a banon such weapons when the United States thought its MX missile wouldbe based in fixed silos and the Soviets were developing mobileweapons.   Chervov acknowledged that an agreement on reducing strategicweapons could not be reached in time for the U.S.-Soviet summitthat begins May 29 in Moscow, as originally had been hoped.However, he said Moscow would continue to negotiate in hopes ofreaching an accord before President Reagan's term ends.   ``The problem now is to establish ourselves so we do not go backfrom the points we have already reached,'' he said.   Chervov also said differences over sea-launched cruise missilescould not be set aside temporarily or solved through unilateraldeclarations, as has been formally suggested by U.S. officials. Hesaid the other major sticking point on a strategic arms reductiontreaty was disagreement over the U.S. Strategic Defense Initiative,also known as Star Wars.</TEXT></DOC>
