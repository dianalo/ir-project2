With all precincts counted, Fink edged Democratic challengerRick Mystrom by 30,338 to 29,245 votes in Tuesday's runoff.   Mystrom did not concede.   ``The public deserves a recount if it's real close,'' he said.``The odds are probably against us but this game is not over by anymeans.''   The city has two weeks to finish examining the challengedballots - those cast by voters at polling places outside their ownprecincts.   City Clerk Ruby Veldkamp said the margin was comfortable byAnchorage election standards.   ``We consider 100 votes a landslide,'' she said, noting thatFink beat Mystrom by just 29 votes in the Oct. 2 three-way racethat included former state legislator H.A. ``Red'' Boucher andforced the runoff.   More than 48 percent of registered voters went to the polls.   Fink's apparent victory was a turnaround for the Republicanpolitician who was rated negatively by 50 percent or more ofAnchorage residents, according to polls six months ago.   ``They said Fink was out of step with the public,'' Fink said ofhis adversaries on the Anchorage Assembly. ``Well, the public said,`No, Fink's not out of step. You are.'''   Mystrom, 46, is a former city assemblyman and former advertisingexecutive who led the city's unsuccessful winter Olympics bid.   Fink, 62, is an Anchorage insurance executive whose firstmayoral term found him variously at odds with the municipalassembly, reporters and unions representing city workers.</TEXT></DOC>
