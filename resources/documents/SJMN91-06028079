I would not think that is a permanent solution by anymeans.&quot;;    Golob and Flavin pointed out that the Kuwait coast is dotted withoil facilities, any one of which could be opened up to spew yet more oil intothe gulf.;    Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of U.S. forces in the gulfregion, said: &quot;I don't think there's really much you can do to prevent themfrom doing that. After all, they're on the ground and we're not. That's one ofthe reasons why we'd like to get back into Kuwait and, you know, put those oilfields back in the hands of the Kuwaitis.&quot;;    Saudi officials said they areprepared to protect their vital water supplies from the advancing oil slick.;   &quot;Mostly, we're on the safe side. We hope we're on the safe side,&quot; saidMohammed Babarhan, operations manager of the Saudi water desalinization plantin the coastal city of Khobar.;    Even if the Saudis have to close all threeof their water plants, they have a two-day supply of water already stored.And, Babarhan said, people and industry could rely on well water. He called it&quot;slightly salty -- but potable.&quot;;    The immediate threat is the existing oilslick.;    By the time the U.S. F-111 warplane hit the Kuwaiti facilitypumping oil to the offshore terminal and thereby into the water, the openvalves of the Sea Island terminal and the open holds of five tankers hadalready dumped uncounted millions of gallons of oil into the gulf, U.S.officials said.;    That oil slick had grown to 35 miles by 10 miles, biggerthan the city of Chicago. It was still heading south Sunday, although itremained offshore.;    The thick waves of oil seen washing ashore and killingbirds and other wildlife in northern Saudi Arabia came from an oil tank atKhafji that U.S. officials said Iraqi forces had shelled several daysearlier.;    Saudi Arabia's petroleum adviser, Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman,was visibly angered by Saddam's tactics when he briefed reporters Sunday.;   &quot;This fellow, the lord of death, lord of disaster, he will destroy anything hecan destroy,&quot; the prince said.;    The oil slick, of course, remains a majorthreat to the diverse ecology of the gulf.;    &quot;Many species occur in the gulfat the extreme of their ability to tolerate those environmental parameters,&quot;said Abdulbar Al-Gain, head of the Saudi Meteorology and EnvironmentalProtection Administration.;    Cleaning up the oil to minimize the ecologicaldamage will be especially difficult.;    Al-Gain estimated the oil flood at1.2 million barrels of oil per day and said it had already surpassed the worldrecord, the Ixtoc I well that spewed at least 3.3 million barrels into theGulf of Mexico in 1980. The Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 dumped 258,000 barrelsof oil.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  STEVEN THOMMA AND JUAN O.
