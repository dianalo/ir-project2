(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A landmark jury verdict gives a smoker'swidower $400,000 in damages, the first time a tobacco company hasbeen ordered to pay money for disease caused by cigarettes.   But the three tobacco companies sued called the verdict avictory and the jury's award a vote of sympathy for the bereavedhusband of Rose Cipollone, who died of lung cancer after smoking 1{packs a day for 40 years.   The U.S. District Court jury Monday exonerated the cigarettemakers Liggett Group Inc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. ofconspiring to mislead the public about smoking's dangers, andrejected punitive damages.   Instead, it decided Liggett failed to warn about the dangers ofcigarettes and violated its promise, or ``express warranty,'' toproduce a safe product.   It awarded Antonio Cipollone damages on the warranty claim butnot for the failure to warn the public because it found his wifewas 80 percent responsible for contracting the disease that killedher in 1984 at age 58.   Liggett faced additional charges because it manufactured theChesterfields and Landamp;Ms that Mrs. Cipollone smoked before 1966, whenCongress ordered health warnings on cigarette packs. Mrs. Cipollonelater used brands by Lorillard and Philip Morris, smoking evenafter having part of her lung removed in 1981.   Liggett attorneys promised an appeal. Cipollone's lawyers saidthey would ask the judge to overturn the decision not to awardposthumous damages to Mrs. Cipollone.   The $35 billion tobacco industry mounted an elaborate defense _one analyst put the cost at $50 million _ to avoid a judgment thatmight unleash a flood of multimillion-dollar lawsuits. Reaction tothe verdict, which followed five days of deliberations, focused onits potential impact on hundreds of such cases pending around thenation.   Cipollone's attorneys said the decision showed the tobaccoindustry is not invincible.   ``Any time a jury awards a $400,000 verdict, I don't think youcan take it too lightly, particularly in a situation where fiveyears ago people thought we were crazy and when for the past 30years people have failed,'' said Marc Z. Edell, Cipollone's lawyer.   Fewer than a dozen of about 300 smoker lawsuits have gone tojuries and the tobacco industry has not paid a dollar in damages.Most of the other cases withered in the face of the well-heeledtobacco industry's legal forces.   ``All I know is that we're not another notch in their gun,''said Edell.   But some said the damages awarded might not be enough toencourage other lawsuits.   ``Are you going to sue if all you're going to get is $400,000?''asked tobacco industry analyst Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch in NewYork.   Financial markets were closed when the verdict came in butKaplan predicted no long-term negative impact on tobacco stocks.   ``Plaintiff attorneys cannot be encouraged by the small size ofthe award, which pales in comparison to the $3 million they spentin time and money to try this case,'' said a joint statement fromPeter Bleakley of Philip Morris and Robert Northrip of Lorillard,both New York based.   ``The fact that the jury awarded no damages to Mrs. Cipollonewas a clear signal from the jury that smoking is a matter ofpersonal choice and responsibility,'' said Alan Hilburg, spokesmanfor Durham, N.C.-based Liggett.   Liggett attorney Donald Cohn said he regarded the award as``sympathy'' for Cipollone, a 64-year-old retired cable splicerfrom Lakehurst who pursued the lawsuit he had filed with his wifein 1983.   ``I believe that it is a victory for her,'' Cipollone said. ``Itwasn't 100 percent. I'm glad that we won partial, but it's astart.''   The jurors in the four-month trial would not discuss the verdictother than to say the process was ``emotional'' and ``nervewracking.''   Anti-smoking groups viewed the verdict as a first step.   It ``destroys the myth of invulnerability'' and should lead toan increase in such lawsuits, said Richard Daynard, a NortheasternUniversity law professor who runs the Tobacco Products LiabilityProject, a support group for litigation against tobacco companies.   ``What it's going to do is encourage hundreds of smokers andtheir families to seek redress. It has finally convinced lots ofsmokers that the evidence is clear,'' he said.   To support the contention that Liggett violated its promise toconsumers of a safe product, Edell introduced advertisements forLiggett's cigarettes from the 1950s.   One featured actress Rosalind Russell with the text reading:``Rosalind Russell says Landamp;M Filters are Just What the DoctorOrdered!'' Others said: ``Nose, Throat and Accessory Organs NotAdversely Affected By Smoking Chesterfields,'' and ``Play Safe,Smoke Chesterfields.''   Cipollone's attorneys also introduced numerous secret corporatedocuments they said chronicled the inner workings of the industry.For many anti-smoking forces, disclosure of these documents intoevidence was a victory.   The documents spoke of a ``gentleman's agreement'' not to docancer research, of an industry ``strategy'' to create ``doubtabout the health charge without actually denying it'' and of aresearch program designed ``so that (the) results cannot harm'' theindustry.   The companies denied the statements in the documents, sayingthey represented the views of individuals and were taken out ofcontext.   They contended that Mrs. Cipollone knew the risks but chose tosmoke anyway. They also argued that smoking is not a proven causeof cancer, and that her type of cancer hasn't been linked tocigarettes.   The defense managed to block many of Cipollone's claims,including contentions that cigarette companies could be blamed forillnesses in smokers unaware of the dangers after the 1966warnings, that the risk of cigarettes outweighed their usefulnessand that the companies knew or should have known of a safer way tomake cigarettes.</TEXT></DOC>
