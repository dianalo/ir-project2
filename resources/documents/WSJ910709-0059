The effect of the decision, critics charged, would be toweaken the U.S. climate research program and strengthen thefledgling Japanese space industry. The decision alsohighlights mounting trouble in NASA's program to spend $50billion over the next 25 years to build a gargantuansatellite system to study the Earth's ecology from space.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We're losing a big piece of our ability to detect{environmental} changes and predict them,&quot; said AlexanderGoetz, director of the University of Colorado's Center of theStudy of Earth from Space. Mr. Goetz is the leader of theteam researching the instrument that NASA rejected, which iscalled the High-Resolution Imaging Spectrometer, or Hiris.   NASA officials didn't return calls seeking comment. Butfor several years, they have touted Hiris as the centerpieceof the climate satellite program. The instrument would samplein great detail wavelengths that include visible light andreflected sunlight invisible to the eye in order to measurebiological and geophysical processes crucial to Earth'secology. Researchers had been expected to use the instrumentto measure the spread of acid rain in forests and changes inthe productivity of grasslands and biological activity in theocean coastal zones, among other activities.   Hiris was planned to fly on the first of NASA's $3 billionEarth Observing System satellites, now scheduled for launchin 1998. But NASA's space science division scrapped theinstrument early this year, although it never publicized themove. NASA gave one of its first indications of the decisionlast month in a briefing agency officials gave to DefenseDepartment scientists examining the role the Pentagon couldplay in studying global change.   Berrien Moore, a University of New Hampshire scientist whoheads NASA's advisory panel on space science, said the spaceagency and a committee of project scientists thought Hiriswas too risky and, at a cost of $440 million, too expensive.He said building the instrument would be deferred until thethird EOS satellite in the series, scheduled for launch in2003. &quot;The fear was this instrument could pull the whole{project} down,&quot; he said.   But given NASA's budget battles with Congress, it isuncertain whether the space agency will get funding for morethan one satellite. The White House is now conducting a studyof the satellite project with an eye toward carving the hugesatellites into a series of smaller, less risky ones.   Instead of using Hiris for high-resolution landmeasurements, NASA decided to rely on a less-capableinstrument that will be built by Japan's powerful Ministry ofInternational Trade and Industry for the Japanese oilindustry, a NASA official told the Pentagon scientists. Japanoffered the instrument to NASA for free. &quot;It's good politicsto work with the Japanese,&quot; said Mr. Goetz.   But Rep. Barbara Boxer (D., Calif.), who heads a Housegovernment operations subcommittee, questioned whether theU.S. was getting a good deal. In a letter to NASAAdministrator Richard Truly, she questioned whether theinformation from the Japanese instrument would give theJapanese oil industry a leg up in competition because itcould receive the data at low prices. Data from the EOSsatellites will be made available at cut-rate fees toscientists, but American companies might be required to paysteep prices for the same data, because it is U.S. policy toprice satellite data at commercial rates.   The Japanese instrument, called the Advanced SpaceborneThermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer, or Aster, willoperate in visible and infrared wavelengths especially usefulfor spotting minerals and geological formations that couldindicate oil under the ground. David Pieri, a researchscientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory who is workingwith the Japanese on the instrument, said that Asterinitially was focused on oil exploration, but would now beused to study geology more widely.   Mr. Pieri, for instance, wants to use the instrument tostudy volcanoes. &quot;The Japanese can't just sit there and focuson what they want.&quot;   Indeed, U.S. scientists said that the decision to useAster would give the Japanese space industry more of a boostthan the oil industry because it would teach Japaneseengineers how to build complex space sensors -- a technologywith broad military and commercial applications. &quot;Short term,we win because we get a free instrument,&quot; said one NASAscientist. &quot;Long term we lose because we don't get technologydevelopment.&quot;   Mr. Goetz said that Hiris, which measures the land, was avictim of rivalry among U.S. scientists as much asinternational politics. With Hiris pushed off the first EOSsatellite, he said, oceanographers were able to get NASA toapprove an ocean-measurement device they had long wanted.</TEXT></DOC>
