STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eighteen East Germans who occupied the U.S.Embassy in an effort to flee to the West left the compound lateWednesday with assurances their government will look favorably ontheir emigration requests, diplomats said.   Earlier in the day, East German police cordoned off the embassyin East Berlin and scuffled with about 50 other refugees alsohoping to gain sanctuary there.   Elsewhere, thousands of other East Germans lined railroad trackswith packed bags and children in tow, hoping to jump aboard trainscarrying their countrymen to the West from Prague, Czechoslovakia,witnesses said. The trains were to pass through East Germany ontheir way to Hof, West Germany.   East Germany reluctantly agreed to allow the exodus, the secondin the last four days, after thousands of its citizens floodedembassies in Prague and Warsaw, Poland.   Wednesday's scuffle in East Berlin came a day after the 18 EastGermans moved into the embassy and refused to leave until they weregiven permission to emigrate from their Communist homeland.   According to a statement from the U.S. Embassy, those 18 agreedto leave the mission Wednesday night and went home. East Germanofficials have promised to ``examine ... with goodwill'' theiremigration applications, the statement said.   Western diplomats in East Berlin said they assume the group willsoon be permitted to leave for West Germany, though it was notclear if East German authorities explicitly made such a promise.   After agreeing to the latest rail exodus, the hard-line EastBerlin government on Tuesday closed its border with Czechoslovakia.That is the only country where East Germans could freely travelwithout government permission.   That closure and the sanctioned exodus from Prague has triggereda flood of other East Germans desperately trying to take part inthe mass transfer.   Witnesses said about 100 East German police scuffled with about50 would-be emigres in front of the U.S. Embassy, preventing theirentry. There were no reports of injuries.   Western reporters saw at least 12 people taken away in policevans, among them a young mother and three wailing children.   The embassy was circled by police, and passers-by were checkedfor documents and told to leave the area. On the corner of thenearby central thoroughfare, Unter den Linden, scores of onlookersgathered to watch.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Verner said the 18 East Germans _10 adults and eight children _ were holed up in the embassy sincelate Tuesday.   Before leaving, the refugees were staying in a cramped room justoff the embassy entrance lobby. They were mostly couples in their20s and many had small children and babies in strollers and baskets.   ``This is our last hope,'' one refugee had said. ``We're notgoing to budge until we know we'll be able to leave.''   Diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity,said four East German refugees fled to the West German diplomaticmission in East Berlin.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said ofthe refugee influx: ``We're talking to the East Germans about itand trying to get them to help resolve the problem through theirimmigration policies.''   Hungarian and West German media reported that thousands more hadcrowded other spots along the route the trains are taking throughEast Germany. Many had their belongings packed and were hoping tojump on the trains, as many did during last weekend's exodus.   In Dresden, witnesses said police used truncheons to clear about5,000 East Germans from the city's central station who gatheredsince Tuesday in hopes of climbing on the western-bound trains.   After being forced out of the station, witnesses said more then5,000 people stretched in a line along the tracks. The crowddispersed by early Wednesday after learning the trains from Praguewere delayed.   During last weekend's exodus of about 7,000 East Germans,several managed to board a train in Dresden as it passed.   Police officials in the West German border town of Hof, wherethe refugees were to arrive, said about 1,000 young East Germanswere waiting along the tracks near Plauen, an East German town nearthe Czechoslovak border.   The embarassing exodus comes as East German plans a weekendcelebration of its 40th anniversary, to be attended by Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.</TEXT></DOC>
