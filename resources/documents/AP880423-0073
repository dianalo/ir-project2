(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A socialite dubbed the ``fugitivetemptress'' who allegedly seduced her lover into arranging herhusband's murder, then ran away with another man, also captivatedthe investigator assigned to hunt her down.   But for different reasons.   Mary Naomi Cloud, 45, formerly of Princeton, was apprehendedlate Thursday in Kennewick, Wash., after spending six years runningfrom charges that she killed her husband.   ``Well, she finally spent a night in jail. I waited a long timefor this,'' a jubilant Don Meadows, an investigator for the MercerCounty prosecutors office, told the Bluefield Daily Telegraphbefore heading back to West Virginia today with Mrs. Cloud incustody.   Meadows said he and other authorities captured Mrs. Cloud as shetried to slip out the back door of her house. Authorities traveledto Washington after receiving a tip.   ``She looked totally shocked,'' he said. ``She was very upset.She didn't say a word to me after we arrested her. Just gave me thedirty looks she used to give me before.''   Mrs. Cloud was charged with being a fugitive during a hearingFriday, said Benton County (Wash.) Sheriff Jim Kennedy. Bond wasset at $100,000 and she waived extradition proceedings, officialssaid.   She had been charged with first-degree murder of her husband,David, who was gunned down in the yard of their home as the couplereturned from a dinner party in Bluefield on Jan. 26, 1980. DavidCloud, 56, was vice president of Carter Machinery Co.   Authorities allege Mrs. Cloud lured her boyfriend at the time,John Elmer Corprew Jr. of Roanoke, Va., into the plot to kill herhusband, and Corprew in turn paid George Guthrie II of Roanoke$2,500 to be the triggerman.   Corprew testified that Mrs. Cloud ``was like a spider and I wascaught in her web.''   Corprew was sentenced to one to five years in prison forvoluntary manslaughter as part of a plea bargain and was releasedafter eight months. Guthrie was convicted of first-degree murder in1984 and sentenced to life in prison. His conviction was overturnedby the state Supreme Court, but he was convicted of the same chargeand received the same sentence again.   Mrs. Cloud contended that her husband was shot in the face by amasked robber who emerged from the darkness as they returned fromthe dinner party. Mercer County Prosecutor David Knight said hebecame suspicious of her story, questioning why the man hadn'trobbed their house, why Mrs. Cloud had been spared and why theassailant fled without taking any valuables.   After she was indicted, Mrs. Cloud moved to Huntington, whereshe worked as a car saleswoman and became romantically involvedwith Bernie D. Stanley, authorities said. She and Stanley fled justbefore her trial was to begin on May 17, 1982, officials said.   Mrs. Cloud had put up as her bond a $50,000 building she owed inPrinceton, but prosecutors said she sold the building beforefleeing.   Meadows said West Virginia authorities showed neighbors picturesfrom Mrs. Cloud's wanted poster and staked out her house once theydetermined the tip was accurate.   Authorities nabbed Mrs. Cloud as she tried to walk out the backdoor while her boyfriend talked to police at the front door,Meadows said. Stanley was not arrested and faces no charges, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
