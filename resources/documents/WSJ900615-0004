While the reductions were modest, and the analysts saidthey continue to recommend the purchase of United stock, theprice drop underscores investor skittishness over evenmarginally negative news about growth companies.</LP><TEXT>   United's shares fell $3.25 to $40.875 in New York StockExchange composite trading on volume of 4.3 million shares.The stock's normal daily volume is about 500,000 shares.   United, which owns the nation's third-largestlong-distance telephone company, US Sprint CommunicationsCo., wouldn't comment on the estimates, saying it doesn'tproject earnings. However, a spokesman said, &quot;We're certainlycomforted that they still consider the stock a strong buyrecommendation.&quot;   &quot;I still think the stock is cheap,&quot; said Jack B. Grubmanof PaineWebber Inc., one of the analysts who cut hisestimate. &quot;It's worth in the mid-50s.&quot;   However, he noted that Sprint's rate of revenue growthfrom the fourth quarter of 1989 to the first quarter of 1990was only a little more than 2%. He added that AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co. has managed to slow the rate atwhich Sprint and MCI Communications Corp. have been able totake away long-distance market share.   Mr. Grubman cut his second-quarter earnings estimate to 53cents a share from 57 cents. For all of 1990, he trimmed hisestimate to $2.50 a share from $2.70 a share, and he loweredhis 1991 projection to $3.55 a share from $3.75 a share.   Joel D. Gross of Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. said hestill regards United's stock as a buy.   &quot;My estimates of $2.50 a share in 1990 and $3.50 in 1991still show a 40% growth rate,&quot; said Mr. Gross. &quot;With thestock trading at less than 12 times earnings next year thatstill looks like a buy . . . to me.&quot;   Mr. Gross had been predicting earnings of $2.64 a share in1990 and $3.78 a share in 1991. He lowered his estimate forthe current second quarter to 57 cents a share from 60 centsa share.</TEXT></DOC>
