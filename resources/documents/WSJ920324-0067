Cook, AtlanticRichfield Co.'s chairman and chief executive officer, andother top officials took cuts of about 50% in their 1991incentive awards, the oil company's proxy showed.   Mr. Cook's bonus was cut to $600,000 from $1,200,000 in1990, although he received a slightly increased base salaryof $1,073,866. Robert E. Wycoff, president and chiefoperating officer, received incentive pay of $375,000, downfrom $800,000 in 1991, and a slightly higher base salary of$760,823. Cash compensation for Arco's top 16 executivestotaled $7,597,244 for 1991, and incentive awards totaled$3,925,325.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Cook also received more than $2 million last yearthrough the exercise of stock options, a figure that an Arcospokesman described as unusually high for the executive.   The bonus cuts reflected the company's poor performance in1991 compared with prior years, the company said. &quot;Themanagement faced up to reality,&quot; the spokesman said, notingthat the decline in Arco's operating results stemmed from lowcrude oil prices.   For 1991, Arco reported a 65% decline in net income to$709 million, or $4.39 a share, which included after-taxcharges of $295 million from property sales, writedowns andpersonnel cuts. Revenue dropped to $18.16 billion from $18.8billion in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
