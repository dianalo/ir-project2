Navy Capt. Stig Morten Karlsen of the Norwegian Supreme DefenseCommand said neither vessel had been in danger.   Darkness and the storm in the Barents Sea made it impossible forthe crews to go on deck to free the 2,000-ton conventionalsubmarine, and the crews had expected to spend a rough nightentangled together.   But the force of the storm did the job for them, tearing thefishing net to pieces under the weight of the submarine. Neithership suffered serious damage, said Major Geir Anda, of theNorwegian Northern Defense Command.   Karlsen said the vessels were in international waters, about 57miles northeast of the town of Vardoe, on Norway's northern coast.   The Soviet Foxtrot-class submarine, which carries a crew of 75,was submerged on a routine patrol from a Soviet base at Murmanskwhen it got snared in the nets of the trawler T.O. Senior, Karlsensaid.   The submarine put up no fight and surfaced at once, cooperatingwith the fishermen.   ``It's totally different than the last time,'' said Karlsen. OnAug. 13 another entangled Soviet submarine dragged a fishing boatbackwards, cut free and fled without identifying itself.</TEXT></DOC>
