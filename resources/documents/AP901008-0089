While noting that no accurate count was possible, he estimatedthat hundreds, if not thousands, of Kuwaitis had been put to death.Some were shot in front of their families. Many others weredeported to Iraq.   Diplomats and Kuwaiti officials in exile endorsed a recentAmnesty International report of ``a horrifying picture ofwidespread arrests, torture under interrogation, summary executionsand mass extrajudicial killings.''   Beyond that, the diplomats and officials said, Iraq was cartingoff everything from blood supplies in hospitals to traffic lightsand forcing citizens to exchange Kuwaiti papers for Iraqi identitycards.   They described a harrowing climate of fear and repression, whichin recent days has triggered another exodus of Kuwaitis into SaudiArabia.   In one incident, a Western diplomat said, Iraqi soldiers shot todeath five hospital workers when doctors told them that a woundedcomrade they brought in was already dead on arrival.   Saddam has entrusted the dismantling of Kuwait to a relative,Ali Hassan al Majid, who two years ago commanded a brutal militarycampaign that crushed a Kurdish uprising with the help of poisongas, diplomats said.   ``That gives some idea of Saddam's thinking,'' one Westernspecialist observed.   As a result of the pressure, Kuwaiti government sources saidthey were not encouraging armed resistance which might provoke evenmore violence.   Some 430,000 Iraqi troops reported to be deployed in occupiedKuwait and southern Iraq outnumber Kuwaitis left in the emirate.   Few sources were prepared to be named since the Iraqis haveacted on published information from refugees and exiles to targetreprisals, diplomats reported.   Increased checkpoints and house-to-house search teams arerooting out suspected dissidents and Westerners on the run.Intelligence units search bank records and private papers to huntdown members of the emir's family and former officials.   Iraq has closed Kuwait not only to journalists but also to theRed Cross and humanitarian workers.   Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassim Ramadan, a close aide ofSaddam's, recently denied human rights abuses, then said Iraq would``cut off the legs'' of anyone trying to enter Kuwait withoutpermission.   Accounts by refugees fit together to draw a clear picture ofIraqi intent.   ``They've taken almost everything to Iraq,'' said Yusuf al-Ali,a 25-year-old Kuwaiti Airways pilot who crossed into Saudi Arabiaon Sunday.   ``You see trucks in front of the big houses. They strip them -carpets, videos, anything.''   On a larger scale, technicians have dismantled medical equipmentand research facilities, burned public buildings and looted grainstocks.   ``They don't need a lot of the things they're taking,'' said AliAbu-Asi, an aide to Kuwait's Crown Prince, Sheik Saad, interviewedin Taif, Saudi Arabia. ``It's to dominate Kuwait, to humiliate itand make it just another province of Iraq.''   Iraqi forces are especailly brutal with anyone representingauthority or anyone suspected of armed resistance, the sourcesagreed.   They said nearly every captured Kuwaiti military and policeofficer was either shot on the spot or taken off for days and thenreturned to be executed in front of relatives.   Over the past few weeks, large numbers of Iraqis have settled inthe conquered emirate, either encouraged by Baghdad or drawn by thechance to grab unprotected property.   Holdout Western embassies have maintained a defiant, ifsymbolic, presence despite Iraqi orders that since Kuwait has beendeclared Iraq's 19th province, foreign embassies are no longerpermitted.   But the diplomats' resources are dwindling fast.   At the U.S. Embassy, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and ahalf-dozen other Americans survive by boiling water from theswimming pool and eating up their last cans of food.   ``Not one of them's going to look at a tunafish sandwich againfor the rest of his life,'' said one U.S. official in touch withthe embassy.   Hundreds of thousands of Asian workers remain in Kuwait,desperately short of food and, in many cases, afraid for theirlives. Hundreds of thousands have left, taking their chances on agrim odyssey across the desert to Jordan or Iran.   Several thousand Westerners are still hiding in suburban homesin Kuwait, waiting for the fateful knock of Iraqi patrols trying toround them up for Saddam's human shield.   U.S. officials estimate that Americans now number about 1,000,one-third of the number who were in Kuwait when Iraq attacked.   The Amnesty International report said: ``Iraqi forces havearrested not only people suspected of armed attacks against them,but men, women and children found with opposition literature, theKuwaiti flag or photographs of the emir.''   It said men were seized at the border and sent to Iraq forsecret detention or military service. The possession of Kuwaitiflags, opposition literature or even the emir's photo is a capitaloffense.   ``The Amnesty report squares absolutely with what we have, andwhat the Kuwaitis here have,'' a veteran diplomat said. ``In fact,things are even worse than that, but no one can get in to revealthe details.''</TEXT></DOC>
