The shares closed up $3.25 at $60.625.   News of the sale comes one month after ITT indicated itmight be willing to sell some or all of its 37% stake inAlcatel, which analysts were valuing at between $2.5 billionand $4 billion. The sale of 7% of Alcatel at $640 millionputs the value of ITT's 37% stake at about $3.4 billion.   &quot;It's a step in the right direction for ITT,&quot; said TheresaM. Gusman, an analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. &quot;It's a clearindication that ITT is reviewing the value of its assets.&quot;She had been valuing the 37% Alcatel stake at about $3billion, but now she believes the value could increaserapidly as Alcatel becomes more profitable.   Alcatel was formed in 1986. To create it, ITT, a NewYork-based conglomerate, sold its European telecommunicationsoperations to CGE in exchange for $1.3 billion and 37% of thestock of the newly combined CGE-ITT operations. CGE, a Frenchtelecommunications concern, owned the remaining 63%.   When Alcatel was created, Wall Street wondered if ITTwould ever recoup its initial investment in this jointventure. But Alcatel has grown more rapidly than analysts andITT's management anticipated.   &quot;Our Alcatel shares have more than doubled in value inthree years,&quot; said Rand V. Araskog, ITT chairman and chiefexecutive officer. &quot;The sale of 7% allows us to takeadvantage, for our shareholders, of a portion of thisincreased value, while retaining an ownership, which we feelwill continue to appreciate at an exceptional rate,&quot; addedMr. Araskog, who is also chairman of Alcatel's supervisoryboard.   In the past few years, Alcatel has benefited as thedevelopment of one common European market has intensified.Alcatel is also poised to profit from the opening of theEastern bloc. Mr. Araskog recognizes that the value of ITT'sinvestment in Alcatel has been enhanced by this rapidprogress.   A Belgian government official said Alcatel Bell, a unit ofAntwerp-based Alcatel, is close to signing a tentativeagreement to supply digital telephone exchange equipment tothe Soviet Union.   The official, Willy Vandenberghe, an adviser to theBelgian trade minister, estimated the value of the project atone billion European currency units ($1.2 billion). Alcateland Soviet authorities are likely to sign a &quot;frameworkagreement&quot; on the venture early next month, he added. Furtherdetails, including financing, would be worked out later.   Mr. Vandenberghe said last week's meeting in Paris of theCoordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controlsremoved a major obstacle to the long-discussed Alcatelventure with the Soviets. Cocom, which includesrepresentatives of the U.S. and 16 Western allies, agreed toloosen limits on exports of computers, telecommunicationsequipment and other high-tech products to the East bloc.   Under the agreement, industry sources said, Alcatel Bellwould first export from Belgium exchange equipment withcapacity for at least 50,000 telephone lines. Later, a jointventure factory would be set up in the Soviet Union toproduce exchange equipment. In a possible third phase,another joint venture plant would be built in the SovietUnion to make sophisticated semiconductors, known as VLSIchips, to be used in the exchanges.   Mr. Vandenberghe said Cocom's new guidelines would allowthe early stages of the venture to go ahead, but the questionof transferring the most sophisticated technology involvedwould have to be reviewed by Cocom.   In New York, ITT said retired Gen. Edward C. Meyer, an ITTdirector, would join Alcatel's nine-member supervisory board,succeeding another ITT representative. Robert Burnett,another ITT director, is already a member of Alcatel's board.   ITT also said it has established a coordination center,named ITT Europe N.V., for the European operations of all ofits nine operating units.   ---   Bob Hagerty contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
