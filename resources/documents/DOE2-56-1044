The variational ansatzis a linear superposition of the known states of the scalar field theorydefined by scrL{sub 0} = (1/2partial/sub {mu}/phipartial/sup {mu}/phi-1)/2{Omega}{sup 2}phi{sup 2}, where {Omega} is a variational parameter. Resultsfor the mass gap m{sub 1} are obtained, using a superposition of one-to nine-particle states of scrL{sub 0} as the variational trial states.Our results are compared to spatial-lattice calculations of the massgap for this model.</TEXT></DOC>
