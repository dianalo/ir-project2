An unexplored continent would become a jail. The space around it, the very air and sea, the whole transparent labyrinth of the South Pacific, would become a wall 14,000 miles thick.&quot;    The coast was New South Wales (with nearby islands), the first colonized area of a mysterious continent that was explored slowly. It began to be called Australia only around 1829. Between 1788 and 1868 it was the dumping ground for what Britain called &quot;criminal classes&quot; -- a term encompassing wrongdoers from petty thieves to murderers. It included some political prisoners, chiefly Irish rebels. Over 160,000 souls were transported to the Antipodes in the course of 80 years.    That experiment -- known as the &quot;System&quot; -- is the subject of an engrossing, detailed, documented history, &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; (Knopf, 714 pages, illustrated plus maps, $24.95) by Robert Hughes. The title is a phrase from convict ballads. Himself an Australian, Mr. Hughes is art critic for Time magazine. All who saw him on public TV in his eight-part series on modern art, &quot;The Shock of the New,&quot; or read its 1981 companion volume, know that he is an excellent writer with a fresh, passionate and moral vision.    The history of &quot;convictry&quot; was neglected in Australia and, until recent years, thrust from public memory as much as possible, Mr. Hughes says. The myth of a &quot;stain&quot; upon the society haunted several generations after the System ended. In the eyes of some who considered themselves of untainted English stock, the stain had to be expiated by the blood of Australian troops in the Boer War and two world wars. Some cynical Australians said their people had been shipped out as criminals and shipped back as &quot;cannon fodder.&quot;    Mr. Hughes describes unsparingly the ugliest aspects of the penal colony but balances them in a complex drama exhibiting the worst and best of human nature among administrators and criminals. Good men among governors, commandants of punishment camps, and sea captains did their best in dreadful situations. There were also some &quot;ogres,&quot; unrestrained sadists, among them. Scenes of flogging and other brutal tortures, at sea and on land, are harrowing.    Good people among the prisoners included slight offenders harshly sentenced. Among the educated, Dr. William Redfern, a convict, became &quot;the father of Australian medicine.&quot; Francis Howard Greenway, convict and architect, designed barracks, a hospital and churches in Sydney. Good conduct could earn a &quot;ticket of leave,&quot; a probation within the colony. Those who served out their sentences and stayed on were &quot;Emancipists.&quot;    There were also monsters among convicts. Michael Howe, who had &quot;the gloomy charisma of the paranoid,&quot; led a gang of &quot;bolters&quot; who &quot;left a wide and furious swath&quot; across Van Diemen's Land, the large island called Tasmania, south of the continent. It was easy to run away but hard to survive. In a grim episode, Alexander Pearce was the last ruthless survivor of a party of desperate &quot;bushrangers&quot; who literally ate each other up while trying to escape through almost impassable terrain.    Strict, honorable Capt. Arthur Phillip commanded the 11 ships of the first transport fleet in 1788 -- &quot;one of the great sea voyages in English history.&quot; He governed New South Wales until 1792. Lachlan Macquarie, last military &quot;proconsul,&quot; stern but humane, governed from 1810-21, beginning the &quot;conversion of a jail into a colony.&quot; He alone, of early governors, &quot;really thought about the rights of these prisoners.&quot; In the 1840s, another Scot, Alexander Maconochie, not a governor, was the &quot;one and only inspired penal reformer to work in Australia.&quot; He improved conditions in Van Diemen's Land and achieved short-lived but major reforms in Norfolk Island, the most savage hellhole. He was so far ahead of his time that officials in London cut off his humane work.    Mr. Hughes describes the woeful fate of the aborigines, who were totally exterminated in Van Diemen's Land. The many tribes on the continent waged a losing struggle against the colonists. The Australian gold rush and the swift spread of sheep ranching began a great change in the society. Voluntary settlers and Emancipists diluted the original ranks of prisoners and jailers.    A powerful descriptive writer, Mr. Hughes depicts flora and fauna, deserts and mountains. He deals at length with the Irish, whether political rebels or criminals, who constituted a difficult minority problem for administrators. Women convicts, often brutally victimized, found their worst suffering to be their utter helplessness.    But the System was not all bad. Mr. Hughes believes one of its hotly debated policies, the &quot;assignment&quot; of convict laborers to private employers who paid only for their keep, was, in spite of abuses, &quot;by far the most successful form of penal rehabilitation that had ever been tried&quot; in England, America or Europe.    The System ended in 1868. Nothing written about it is comparable to &quot;The Fatal Shore.&quot; The research is vast. Official documents are used copiously. But Mr. Hughes's unprecedented achievement is letting the convicts and their families speak for themselves through extensive quotations from letters and diaries never before published.    &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; is an epic story of an emergent nation. It will not be superseded soon, if ever. </TEXT></DOC>
