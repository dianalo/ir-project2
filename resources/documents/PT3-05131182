The lure is provided with a pair of      vinyl sheet members each having a lure decoration printed along a convex      surface, and molded to conform to the curved cavity of a corresponding one      of the body parts. A translucent adhesive joint is provided between each      vinyl sheet and the corresponding cavity in order to obtain enhanced lure      characteristics from the top and bottom of the lure. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention relates generally to fishing lures, and in particular      relates to an encapsulated fishing lure and a method for making such      lures. </PAR><PAR>  There are a number of prior art encapsulated lure designs. In one prior art      arrangement, two plastic body halves are provided, with a cavity in each      body part. The fishing lure design is painted across the surface of the      cavity, and the two body parts are then adhered together. Another type of      prior art lure incorporating an interior decoration utilizes a foam insert      to extend within the cavity of the encapsulated body, the foam either      having the lure design painted on its surface, or alternatively the foam      being used as an insert to hold a flat plastic decoration outwardly      against the surface of the body cavity. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention contemplates both an encapsulated lure having an      interior lure decoration which is highly visible from not only the      opposing sides, but also the top and bottom of the lure in order to      enhance the ability of the lure to attract fish. The present invention is      also directed to a method for manufacturing the lure in a facile manner. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the manufacturing method of the present invention, a      pair of translucent body parts are provided, each having a cavity      extending into the body from one side. A sheet of vinyl which is      sufficiently thin to permit molding, but sufficiently thick to retain a      molded shape after molding is printed with the desired lure decoration      along one surface. Thereafter, the vinyl sheet is then appropriately      molded so that the lure decoration appears along an outside convex      surface. Preferably, a plurality of lure decorations are simultaneously      molded. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter, the molded lure decorations are severed from the vinyl sheet in      pairs which are mirror images. The molded and decorated vinyl sheet      portions are then adhered to the surfaces of respective cavities of the      body parts with an adhesive which is translucent after setting, and      preferably which is activated only upon the occurrence of the specified      event. In a preferred embodiment, the adhesive is one which is activated      after being irradiated with ultraviolet light, in order to permit each      decorated portion to be placed into the corresponding cavity and smoothed      out to remove any bubbles and wrinkles. Thereafter, the body part is      irradiated with ultraviolet light in order to activate the adhesive and      insure a good, uniform bonding joint between each body part and the      respective molded decoration. An internal wire member is inserted between      the two body parts with exterior treble hooks, and then the two body parts      are joined together with a translucent adhesive, preferably also the      ultraviolet lightsensitive adhesive discussed above. </PAR><PAR>  In a preferred embodiment of the method of the present invention, the      molding step is carried out in a female molding arrangement, such that the      decorated vinyl sheets are inserted with the decoration facing into the      molded cavity. It has also been determined that vinyl sheeting on the      order of between about 4.0 to 12.0 mils in thickness achieves the desired      flexibility and molding characteristics for permitting ease of molding,      while retaining the molded shape. </PAR><PAR>  The fishing lure in accordance with the present invention thus provides a      lure having a body of a translucent plastic with an internal cavity, the      cavity having an outwardly facing wall, and with a lure decoration along      the outwardly facing wall with a translucent adhesive joint between the      lure decoration and the cavity wall. It has been found that the      translucent adhesive joint imparts a desirable refraction of the image of      the lure from all directions, when the lure decoration is firmly adhered      to an internal curved cavity within the body. Thus, the refracted image of      the lure appears not only from the two sides of the lure, but also from      the top and bottom. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIGS. 1-4 are side elevation, top, front and rear views, respectively, of a      right hand body part useful in the fabrication of a fishing lure in      accordance with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5-8 are side elevation, top, front and rear views, respectively, of a      left hand body part useful in the fabrication of a fishing lure in      accordance with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a top view of a flat carrier sheet useful for printing lure      decorations in accordance with the method; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a perspective view of molding apparatus useful in the method; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a top view of right and left hand molded lure decorations of the      type printed on the sheet of FIG. 9, and after molding in the apparatus of      FIG. 10; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a perspective view illustrating steps of the method; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 13 is a side elevation of the right side of a finished lure in      accordance with the present invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 and 15 are top views of fishing lures of the present invention, and      which are used to illustrate the refractivity of the adhesive joint in      accordance with the method. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  The method for making the fishing lure in accordance with the present      invention will be described with reference to FIGS. 1-12. </PAR><PAR>  Noting FIGS. 1-4, there is provided a translucent right hand body part 10      formed in a plastic member 12 having a flat internal surface 11 and a      central cavity 14. The cavity has a generally curved surface, as is best      seen in the end views of FIGS. 3 and 4. The body part 10 has a front face      13 which is angled so as to impart a diving action to the lure, and two      joining tabs 15 and 17 at the opposing ends. Channels 16 and 18 are formed      in the surface 11, the channel 18 extending to the rear 19 of the body      part. The joining tabs 15 and 17 are used to join the body part 10 with a      left hand body part (FIGS. 5-8), and the channels 16 and 18 permit the      installation of a wire member for holding exterior hooks (note FIG. 13). </PAR><PAR>  The left hand body part 20 shown in FIGS. 5 and 8 is also translucent, and      is a mirror image of the body part 10 of FIGS. 1-4. In FIGS. 5-8, the same      body element is referred to with a similar ending reference numeral; e.g.,      the cavity 24 of body part 20 corresponds to cavity 14 of body part 10,      and so forth. However, the body part 20 includes a pair of holes 25, 27      extending into surface 21 and dimensioned to receive tabs 15 and 17 when      the two body parts are brought together into a unitary (note FIG. 15). </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, the two body parts 10, 20 are fabricated from a high impact      translucent plastic, such as LEXAN (a trademark of the DuPont Company).      While the body parts 10, 20 are described as translucent, they may be      tinted with an appropriate color consistent with the lure decorations to      be adhered into the cavities 14, 24 as described below. </PAR><PAR>  Reference is now made to FIG. 9. In accordance with 10 the present      invention, a flat plastic sheet 30, preferably a vinyl, is provided. As      will be described below, the vinyl sheet 30 is subjected to a molding step      and is therefore selected so that it has sufficient flexibility to permit      easy adherence into the cavities 14, 24 of the body parts 10, 20 but      having a sufficient rigidity to retain a molded shape after being molded.      To this end, it has been determined that a vinyl sheet having a thickness      on the order of about 4.0 to 12.0 mils in thickness is suitable. Since      vinyl sheets are frequently found in thinner gauges, it has been found      necessary from time to time to sandwich two or more vinyl sheets together      to achieve the desired thickness. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 9, a plurality of lure decorations are printed on to the      vinyl sheet 30; preferably, the lure decorations are printed in adjacent      mirror image pairs, as is illustrated by lure decorations 32 and 34. The      particular lure decorations 32, 34 are depicted as a bait fish, with a      mouth 33, eyes 35 and back colorations 37. All of these colorations are      selected to attract fish, particularly the large eyes 35. The lure      decorations are, of course, printed on the vinyl sheet 30 while in a flat      condition. Mold guides 36 and 38 may also be printed on the sheet 30 with      the lure decorations 32, 34. </PAR><PAR>  The vinyl sheet 30 is then subjected to a molding step in an appropriate      apparatus, such as the molding box 40 shown in FIG. 10. The molding box 40      includes a housing 42 forming a plenum and an upper plate 43 into which      female cavities 44 are formed. Each cavity 44 includes an evacuation      opening 46. The molding box 40 further includes an enclosing top 48 and an      evacuation hose 50 through which a vacuum can be drawn. In use, the vinyl      sheet 30 is inserted into the molding box 40, with the printed lure      decorations 32, 34 facing downwardly toward corresponding cavities 44. A      vacuum is then drawn through hose 50, while applying heat to the vinyl      sheet 30 in a conventional manner. The sheet 30 is thus molded at each      lure decoration 32, 34; it will of course be understood that the shape of      the female cavity 44 at each position corresponding to a lure decoration      32, 34 has the shape of the printed lure decoration on sheet 30, which      shape in turn corresponds to either the left or right hand cavity 14, 24      for the respective body part 10, 20. In the specific arrangement shown in      the drawing, lure decoration 34 is a right hand decoration which      corresponds in shape and dimension to the cavity 14 of body part 10 in      FIG. 1, and lure decoration 32 is a left hand decoration which corresponds      in shape and dimension to cavity 24 of body part 20 after it is molded. </PAR><PAR>  After the molding step, all of the molded lure decorations, including      decorations 32, 34 are severed from the vinyl sheet 30; the two severed      lure decorations 32, 34 are shown in a top view in FIG. 11. </PAR><PAR>  Reference is now made to FIG. 12. In order to bond the lure decorations 32,      34 to the respective cavity 24, 14 and achieve the desired refractive      characteristics discussed above, a bead of an ultraviolet light-sensitive      adhesive 52 is placed along the center of each cavity 24, 14. Thereafter,      the corresponding lure decoration 32, 34 is placed into the respective      cavity 24, 14 and manually pressed uniformly along the entire length and      width of the lure decoration in order to spread the adhesive bead 52 into      an adhesive joint uniformly between the lure decoration and the internal      surface of the corresponding cavity 24, 14. Of course, this can be done      manually by manufacturing worker using a finger 54, as is shown in FIG.      12, or may be done in an automated manner. In either event, it is      important to remove all bubbles and wrinkles from between the lure      decoration 32, 34 and the corresponding surface of the cavity 24, 14 in      order to achieve the desired refraction characteristics discussed below.      After achieving a uniform joint of the adhesive 52 across the surface of      the cavities 24, 14, the body parts 10, 20 are subjected to ultraviolet      radiation through the body part from the outside surface in order to cure      the adhesive 52. A wire harness 55 and treble hooks 59 are then installed      into one of the pair of channels 16, 18 or 26, 28 and the two body parts      10, 20 joined together with a translucent adhesive (which may also be the      ultraviolet-sensitive adhesive described above). The resulting lure is      shown in FIG. 13. </PAR><PAR>  The manner in which the translucent adhesive joint achieves a desired      enhancement of the fish luring ability for a lure manufactured in      accordance with the present invention will now be described with reference      to FIGS. 14 and 15. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 14 illustrates a lure 70 fabricated essentially as described above,      but in which the two lure decorations are not adhered with a translucent      adhesive joint to the corresponding internal cavities 14, 24; that is to      say, the lure decorations are simply placed into the respective cavities      without any adhesive being added between the lure decorations 32, 34 and      the adjacent body part 10 or 20. Although the lure decorations 32, 34      conform very closely to the shape of the respective cavity 24, 14, it can      be seen in FIG. 14 that the refractivity of the body parts is such that      the decorations 32, 34 virtually disappear when seen from the top. On the      other hand, in FIG. 15, the two lure decorations 32, 34 are refracted      through the adhesive joint from the top, and thus establish a full lure      appearance from the top thereby enhancing the ability to lure fish from      the top as well. A similar refraction occurs from the bottom of the lure. </PAR><PAR>  This concludes the description of the preferred embodiments. A reading by      those skilled in the art will bring to mind various changes without      departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended,      however, that the invention only be limited by the following appended      claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
