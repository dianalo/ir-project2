Investors have moved almost $21 billion into bond funds sofar this year in pursuit of higher yields than are availableon safer investments such as money market funds, now yielding5.6%. Especially popular have been global bond funds, some ofwhich yield more than 9%, and Government National MortgageAssociation bond funds, yielding around 7.8%.</LP><TEXT>   Stock-fund inflows also have slowed in recent weeks, fundcompanies say. &quot;We had a very good month, but it wasn't likeMay,&quot; says Robert Leo, director of mutual funds at ShearsonLehman Brothers. &quot;With the blip-up in interest rates, andwith a stalling of the stock market, we've seen maybe a 15%slowdown in sales from May's levels.&quot;   May's $5 billion inflow into bond funds was slightly belowthat of April, when bond funds attracted $6 billion. Thesenumbers, released yesterday by the Investment CompanyInstitute, represent new bondfund sales minus withdrawals bydeparting shareholders, plus the net result of switchesbetween bond funds and other funds in the same fund group.Reinvested dividends are excluded.   Even if bond-fund inflows stalled for the rest of theyear, 1991 would still be the best year for bond funds since1986, when these funds attracted $108.6 billion.   May's bond-fund numbers held one surprise. High-yieldingjunk-bond funds, which had been the best-performing categoryof bond fund in 1991, had a net outflow of $155 million lastmonth after pulling in $305 million in April.   Part of the outflow reflects departures by fund &quot;traders&quot;who had reaped a quick profit, says Avi Nachmany, an analystwith Strategic Insight, a division of Jesup, Josephthal andamp; Co.But he also credits the small investor's tendency to want to&quot;get even, then get out.&quot; Fund investors who suffered throughthe 1989 and 1990 junk-bond market traumas may be bailing outof junk funds now that they have recouped their losses.   Stock funds attracted more than $3.5 billion in May, upfrom $2.9 billion in April. But major fund groups such asFranklin Resources, Oppenheimer Management Corp., T. RowePrice Associates, Shearson and Vanguard Group say the flow ofmoney into stock funds slowed in June.   Fidelity Investments, the U.S.'s largest manager of stockmutual funds, has seen a modest cash outflow from its stockfunds this month. &quot;We've seen some profit-taking in thelatter half of June,&quot; says Michael Hines, a Fidelitymarketing vice president.   Not only did stock funds pick up less money in June, butmuch of the money that came in seems to have ended up in themore conservative types of stock funds. At T. Rowe Price inBaltimore, the best-selling stock fund this month has beenits equity-income fund, which tends to buy large-companystocks paying big dividends.   Meanwhile, two of T. Rowe Price's more aggressive funds,its small-company growth fund and its technology specialtyfund, have seen moderate cash outflows so far this month.   Other fund groups -- including Financial Funds, Jones andamp;Babson and Massachusetts Financial Services -- also say theirsmall-stock funds had net cash outflows in June. Earlier inthe year, small-stock funds were tearing up the track, but&quot;the small-company sector has slowed down in performance inthe last month or two,&quot; says Richard Graber, a senior vicepresident with Jones andamp; Babson.   According to a survey done for Fidelity by the Universityof Michigan Survey Research Center, stock-fund inflows may beeven slower in the months ahead. The June survey ofmutual-fund investors' intentions to purchase stock fundsover the next three months found that 24% planned to investin a stock fund, down from 47% in May.   At the end of May, stock fund managers were sitting on$29.1 billion in cash, equal to 9.4% of stock-fund assets.That's the lowest percentage since May 1989, down slightlyfrom April's 9.5%.   But fund managers aren't quite as bullish as the numbersindicate. The cash percentage drop partly reflects the slightstock-market gain during May, which boosted the value ofstock-fund assets. Only 64% of new investor money coming intostock funds last month ended up in stocks. The rest was addedto the cash holdings of stock funds.</TEXT></DOC>
