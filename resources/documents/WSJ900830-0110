Japanese officials emphasized that this was the first timeJapan has taken part in a tense military confrontation in adistant region since World War II. They pleaded forinternational understanding of the country's inability tosend military forces or weapons.</LP><TEXT>   But it's unclear what kind of reviews the package will getabroad. The U.S., in particular, has been pressuring Japanfor a sizable contribution to the region. But many details ofthe package remain to be worked out, and Foreign Ministryspokesman Taizo Watanabe declined to put a price tag on it.   Late Thursday morning in Tokyo, Mr. Watanabe said thatafter an evening of strenuous internal negotiations, Japanhad decided to estimate the value of its logistical andmedical contributions at $1 billion but still didn't have anytotal figure for its contributions to countries in theregion.   Japanese press reports said Mr. Kaifu explained thepackage to President Bush by telephone before unveiling it ina televised news conference. The reports said Mr. Bushexpressed understanding but urged Japan to do more. Briefingforeign reporters, Mr. Watanabe declined to confirm whetherthe call had taken place.   In Washington, Margaret Tutwiler, the State Departmentspokeswoman, said the measures announced by Japan were&quot;useful initial steps in responding to the Persian Gulfcrisis.&quot; She made clear that the U.S. was hoping for furtheractions. &quot;We look forward to discussing with Japan the exactdetails of what Japan will do, as we consider what furthersteps and contributions might be necessary as the situationin the Gulf evolves,&quot; she said.   Under the package, Japan will help transport food, waterand medical supplies to the U.S.-led multinational forces inthe Persian Gulf area and dispatch a 100-person civilianmedical team. Japan will also give at least $10 million tohelp evacuees from Kuwait and Iraq and will help theeconomies of Turkey, Jordan and Egypt with an unspecified sumof low-interest loans and grants.   &quot;It's difficult to say whether it's millions of dollars orbillions of dollars,&quot; Mr. Watanabe said of the loans andgrants.   It's also difficult to estimate the price tag of the wholepackage. The only figure mentioned in the government'sseven-paragraph press release is the $10 million. Accordingto an air-cargo industry source, a charter flight from Japanto the Middle East would cost about $650,000 plus insurance.But it's not clear how many flights will be covered under thepackage.   Bureaucrats crafted the measures to minimize domesticcontroversy over the constitutionality of assisting amilitary operation outside Japan. The country won't send anymembers of its euphemistically named Self-Defense Forces. Theprivate Japanese ships and planes that the government willcharter won't carry any munitions or weaponry, a conditioninsisted on by some unionized crews.   But the government could come under fire domestically overone provision of the package. In addition to chartering itsown ships and planes to carry food, water and medicalsupplies, Japan will help pay for charters by othercountries. The foreign ships and planes chartered by theseJapanese payments may be used to transfer munitions andweaponry.   Mr. Kaifu, defending his package, said: &quot;We cannot affordto be seen not doing anything about a problem which threatensour own national interests.&quot; He suggested that Japan adopt a&quot;United Nations Peace Cooperation Law&quot; that would enable thecountry to react more quickly in the future. But he didn'tsay when, if at all, he might introduce such legislation, norwhat exactly it might stipulate.   Some senior conservative politicians have called in recentdays for legislation that would allow Japan to dispatch itsSelf-Defense Forces overseas. But Mr. Kaifu gave no sign ofsupporting their call.   While declining to give examples of the kind of equipmentJapan might supply, he said the country would give the U.S.and other countries a list of all the equipment available inJapan and pay for any of it they chose. After exhaustingJapan's supplies of such equipment, Japan would buy similaritems in other countries for use by the multinational forces.   Mr. Watanabe said some American officials had been briefedon this plan, &quot;and the reaction was positive.&quot;   Japanese officials hope to work out the details of its aidto Turkey, Jordan and Egypt before Mr. Kaifu visits thosecountries along with Oman and Saudi Arabia, probably in earlyOctober. Mr. Watanabe said the aid would be based on requestsfrom the countries, which are now being reviewed.   The process is taking longer than expected, he said, inpart because some countries, instead of asking for grants asexpected, asked for low-interest loans and technicalcooperation. But Mr. Watanabe emphasized that at least partof the &quot;significant magnitude&quot; of aid that Japan will givewill be outright grants.   A senior Finance Ministry official had said previouslythat Japan wanted aid to be financed by several big countriesjointly and funneled through the World Bank and InternationalMonetary Fund. The government's news release suggested thatJapan would give the aid both directly and through the WorldBank and IMF, but Mr. Watanabe said that &quot;even if we go aheadwith unilateral aid, we want to have multilateralcoordination.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
