Lloyd Bentsen says the Senate FinanceCommittee, which he heads, will consider a wide array of proposalsnext year for encouraging saving and investment, including a cut incapital-gains taxes.   Expanded Individual Retirement Accounts also will be consideredas Congress looks for ways to increase productivity and thenation's ability to compete with foreign producers, Bentsen saidWednesday.   ``Is there no way America can better compete abroad?'' the TexasDemocrat asked in remarks prepared for a meeting of the TaxFoundation in New York. ``In fact, there is. The key is toaccumulate investment capital _ and then use that capital torestore our manufacturing base from the 21 percent of grossnational product it is today to about 25 percent.''   With Bentsen and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell,D-Maine, leading the way, Congress this year defeated PresidentBush's call for a reduction in taxes on capital gains, which areprofits from the sale of investments.   Democratic leaders viewed the proposed reduction as a windfallfor the rich, the beginning of the undoing of the landmark 1986 taxoverhaul and a deficit-increaser that would do little for theeconomy. They responded with a plan to liberalize tax-deductibleIRAs but withdrew that proposal when the capital-gains cut failed.   In his remarks to the Tax Foundation, which honored him with itsdistinguished achievement award, Bentsen had much to say in favorof IRAs but little for a capital-gains tax cut.   He cited Canada's experience as evidence that IRAs encouragesaving. The U.S. and Canadian savings rates were comparable untilthe mid-1970s, when the Canadian rate soared but the U.S. rate fellto less than half that of Canada, Bentsen said.   ``What accounts for this sudden divergence? Some economistsbelieve it can be attributed to broader eligibility and higherlimits for IRA plans in Canada,'' Bentsen said.   He said he once supported a lower capital-gains tax rate. Butthat preferential rate was far more important when the nation'swealthiest people paid tax rates as high as 90 percent on part oftheir income, he said.   He criticized the temporary nature of the capital-gains tax cutpassed by the House this year and said supporters of a reductionmust find a way to pay for it.   For a cut to win his support, Bentsen said, ``We would have toanswer the virtually unanimous verdict of economists that after ...(the) first year such a cut drains the treasury.''</TEXT></DOC>
