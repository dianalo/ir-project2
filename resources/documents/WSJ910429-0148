The group, which is nearly finished with its technicalwork, includes Apple Computer Inc., Novell Inc., LotusDevelopment Corp. and Microsoft Corp.; Sun Microsystems Inc.and Digital Equipment Corp., both of which make high-powereddesktop computers called workstations, also are involved, asare several small computer-security companies.</LP><TEXT>   The effort is aimed at making it possible toelectronically send messages and documents that can't bealtered and that automatically identify the sender through aunique &quot;digital signature.&quot; Such a feature, some believe, isessential if electronic documents are to pass muster ascontracts and permanent records.   Electronic documents currently have limited value in suchareas as procurement, record-keeping and even messagingbecause, under conventional computer networks, senders andrecipients are never certain that their documents haven'tbeen forged or altered. This undermines confidence incomputer communications and can allow parties to breakcontracts or promises entered into electronically.   The new group is moving to address this shortcoming byagreeing to use the security approach of RSA Data SecurityInc., a closely held concern based here. RSA Data pioneeredan approach to encrypting electronic documents called &quot;publickey,&quot; which assigns to each subscriber a secret key, or code,and a public key, published in a directory. Both keys areproduced, and linked, by a mathematical formula. Senders usethe addressee's public key to route their messages, andrecipients use their secret key for deciphering.   Digital Equipment, Lotus and Novell have alreadyincorporated RSA Data's techniques in their products.Microsoft, the biggest supplier of personal-computersoftware, and Sun Microsystems are each negotiating forrights to RSA Data's techniques in future products. AppleComputer won't comment on its plans with RSA Data but says itis considering adding security features to its Macintoshline.   Brownell Chalstrom, an executive with Lotus, said thegroup is developing common ways to ensure that RSA Data'stechniques work for documents sent between different softwareapplications and operating systems. Without such standards,each company might devise its own, incompatible way of usingRSA Data's techniques.   Industry support for RSA Data is significant because thecompany's technology is seen as something of a hot potato bythe National Institute of Standards and Technology, aCommerce Department agency that was empowered by Congress in1987 to set standards for computer security.   In crafting security standards, the institute works withthe National Security Agency. The institute's initial goal isto produce a standard for digital signature. But last summer,government officials charged that the NSA was blockingprogress on digital signature because it feared thetechnology was too effective in ensuring privacy. To defusecomplaints it had caved in to the NSA, the institute promiseda congressional panel last July that it would deliver a draftstandard for at least digital signature by October.   The institute still hasn't delivered, and the agency isn'tsaying any longer when it will. Past predictions &quot;have been asource of embarrassment,&quot; says Lynn McNulty, the institute'sassociate director for computer security. &quot;I'd prefer not tocommit myself to anything.&quot;   Mr. McNulty says the delay is understandable becausedigital signature poses complex issues. He says the instituteis &quot;very pleased&quot; with the NSA's help and that the twoagencies are studying alternatives to RSA Data's approach.   Part of the reason the U.S. computer industry is rapidlyembracing RSA Data is that it fears the national institutewill endorse an untested approach that will set back theindustry's commercial efforts. Several internationalstandards bodies already have backed RSA Data, and U.S.companies fear they will lose computer sales abroad if theydon't do the same.</TEXT></DOC>
