A study by the Northeast-Midwest Institute, a public policygroup with ties to the region's members of Congress, says theindustrial North is enjoying bigger income gains but has far lesspopulation growth than the Sunbelt.   The population of the 18 Northern states stretching fromMinnesota to New England will grow by 3.8 percent through the1990s, only about half the national average, according to the studytitled ``The State of the Region'' and released Wednesday.   In recent years, the South and West have drawn industries andjobs from the North. Even though the Northeast's overall economyhas rebounded, the region will not be able to keep up with thecompeting areas' population growth, the study said. It estimatedthat the population of the West and South will grow 10 percent inthe next decade.   For the Northeast, the lagging population growth will translateinto fewer representatives in the House and fewer federal dollarsfrom programs based on the number of people in a state or area, thestudy said.   ``Political influence, from the selection of the president inthe electoral college to appropriation fights in the House ofRepresentatives, will shift further to the South and West,'' thestudy said.   The Northeast could lose 14 House seats after the 1990 census,the report said. The region lost 15 seats after the 1980 census,for a total projected loss in representation of 13 percent in the1970s and 1980s, the study said.   The lagging population gains in the Northeast and Midwest resultboth from lower birth rates and migration to Southern and Westernstates, the study said.   ``The short-term economic outlook for the entire region ispositive,'' the study said. The Northeast shared in the nationalreturn to prosperity from 1983 to late 1986, with New Englandbenefiting the most.   Unemployment has dropped below the national average in parts ofthe region, but the Northeast is unlikely to regain many of the 1.3million manufacturing jobs lost between 1980 and 1986, the studysaid. The population that remains, however, is enjoying faster percapita income growth than that of Southerners and Westerners.   The South and West for the first time topped the Northeast andMidwest in manufacturing employment in 1986. The Sunbelt had 9.5million employees on manufacturing payrolls, compared with 9.4million in the Northeast and Midwest.   Other points made by the study were:   _The Northeast and Midwest invested more in public schooleducation than did other regions.   _The trend toward an older population was more evident in theNortheast and Midwest than in the rest of the country.   Northeast states covered by the report were: Connecticut,Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts,Michigan, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio,Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Wisconsin.   The privately funded Northeast-Midwest Institute was formed in1977 at the request of members of the House and Senate from theregion. The study also was sponsored by two legislative groups: theNortheast-Midwest Congressional Coalition and the Northeast-MidwestSenate Coalition.</TEXT></DOC>
