A major mechanism for coping with this situation hasbeen a twofold strategy of promoting conservation policies and increasingthe supplies of domestic resources to ensure energy security. As a consequenceof these measures a number of large-scale energy projects has been initiatedin several countries. These include projects to extract and convert primaryenergy in resource frontiers (Canada and the US); the development oflarge-scale primary and secondary energy supply systems (USSR); and integratedprojects combining conservation and conversion of primary energy, distributionof secondary energy, and transmission of final energy (Sweden). Whilethese projects may be localized spatially, their consequences are incidenton various activities at many spatial levels (local, regional, national,and international), and have diverse environmental, economic, socialand institutional effects that may persist over long periods of time.In this chapter, the authors continue to outline the characteristicsof such large-scale energy developments and their impact pathways, andidentify the complex multidimensional and pervasive nature of their impacts.</TEXT></DOC>
