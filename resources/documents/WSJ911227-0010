State Supreme Court Justice Michael J. Dontzin, a trialjudge, ruled that the city had filed its two-year-old suittoo many years after it learned of the dangers of lead paint,which has been linked to neurological ailments.</LP><TEXT>   But the judge left open two other avenues for New York torecover more than $50 million it is demanding as compensationfor lead contamination in city housing projects. The city canstill try to prove that the former manufacturers of thewhite-lead pigment used to make lead paint committed fraud byaggressively marketing lead paint while concealing itsdangers from the public. It can also argue that the city isowed restitution for money spent cleaning up lead paintdamage.   About a half-dozen lead paint cases are pending in statecourts in New York and Massachusetts and federal courts inPhiladelphia and Boston. The plaintiffs in these cases allegethat the former manufacturers of the white-lead pigment areresponsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in medicaland clean-up costs.   The defendants include Sherwin-Williams Co., NL IndustriesInc., Eagle Picher Industries Inc., Atlantic Richfield Co.and Glidden Co., all of which have stopped making leadpigment and paint, as well as the Lead Industry Association,a trade group.   Attorneys for lead paint manufacturers hailed JusticeDontzin's ruling, saying that it shows they will prevail inthe other lead paint cases. One of the defendants' chieflegal strategies has been to argue that the lead paint suitswere filed too late. Most were filed in the late 1980s, morethan a decade after state and federal laws restricting leadpaint were passed.   &quot;Cities and public bodies knew {about the dangers of leadpaint} for years,&quot; said Paul &quot;Mickey&quot; Pohl, an attorney inthe Pittsburgh office of Jones, Day, Reavis andamp; Pogue. Mr.Pohl, who represents Sherwin-Williams, said the New Yorkdecision will discourage the filing of similar suits.   Alan Kleinman, an assistant corporation counsel for NewYork, said he didn't know if the city would appeal theruling. He said the dismissal of the product liability andnegligence claims won't hurt the city's chances of winningthe suit. &quot;The damages will be just about the same,&quot; headded.   Justice Dontzin ordered the parties to investigate whenNew York should have become aware of any alleged fraud. Hewill then decide whether the statute of limitation applies tothat claim as well.   Lawyers watching lead paint litigation are also eagerlyawaiting a ruling by a federal judge in Boston on the issueof whether liability can be split among lead paintmanufacturers based on their market share.   (City of New York vs. Lead Industries Ass., Supreme Court,New York, 14365/89)   ---   ARBITRATORS MAY disregard contract limits on damageawards, judge rules.   U.S. District Judge James P. Churchill of Detroit declinedto overturn an arbitrator's award that was more than doublethe limit agreed upon in a contract between the parties inthe litigation. The ruling calls into question the validityof award limitations in contracts that many believed boundarbitrators.   The ruling arose from a dispute between St. Luke'sHospital in Detroit and a vendor, SMS Computer Systems Inc.of Malvern, Pa. St. Luke's claimed a computer system that itpurchased from the company did not perform properly and fileda request for arbitration. The sales contract containedprovisions calling for an arbitrator to resolve disputes andthat damages be limited to $400,000. Nevertheless thearbitrator awarded $850,000 in damages to St. Luke's.   SMS Computer appealed the award, arguing that thearbitrator exceeded his authority. St. Luke's countered thatthe arbitrator had the right to award damages up to $6million, the value of the computer system.   In his decision, Judge Churchill said an arbitrator maydisregard a damages limitation when circumstances make itoppressive or when the seller has defaulted on the terms ofthe sale.   Alan Borlack, St. Luke's attorney, said the ruling sends amessage to vendors that arbitrators have the ability toinvalidate the damages provisions.   Francis Ortiz, an attorney for SMS Computer, said hisclient may appeal the ruling.   Some arbitration experts say the ruling is rare butproperly reasoned. &quot;It's consistent with the trend thatjudges will give a great deal of deference to arbitrators,&quot;said Terry Leahy, a mediator in Washington with EndisputeInc., an alternative dispute resolution firm.   John H. Wilkinson, an attorney and author of a practiceguide on arbitration, said the ruling is &quot;outrageous&quot; becauseit undercuts the incentive for choosing arbitration andsetting limits on damages.   Mr. Wilkinson, a partner at the New York law firm DonovanLeisure Newton andamp; Irvine, said parties set limits on liabilityto save money by arbitrating up to that amount. Beyond that,the parties typically assume, they won't save money througharbitration and might as well resolve their differences incourt, Mr. Wilkinson added. If an arbitrator exceeds theamount, there's little advantage in staying out of court, hesaid.
