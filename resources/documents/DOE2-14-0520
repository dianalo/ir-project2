To circumvent this problem, the authorsdesigned, constructed, and tested a 30-cm prototype superconducting,self-shielded, high field magnet. This unshimmed superferric magnet canoperate between 0.5 and 4 T with a field quality of about one part permillion over one quarter of its aperture. The magnet can be ramped fromone field strength to another in approximately 10 minutes. The 5-Gaussline extends less than 1 meter outside the magnet structure. Furtherdetails, including MR measurements and images, are demonstrated, as wellas 1-meter bore scale-up projections.</TEXT></DOC>
