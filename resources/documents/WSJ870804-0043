The Army notified Dyncorp last month that it was considering instituting a debarment proceeding against the McLean, Va.-based technological services company. The action stemmed from the conviction last spring of the company's Dynalectric unit on fraud and bid-rigging charges. After holding a hearing on the matter, the Army told the company that it won't go through with the debarment proceeding, Dyncorp said. The Army's decision doesn't affect the suspension of Dynalectric. Dyncorp got about one-third of its $749.1 million in revenue last year from government contracts. </TEXT></DOC>
