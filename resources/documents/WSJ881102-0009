According to a survey of 2,000 lenders completed Friday by HSH Associates, Butler, N.J., about 150 mortgage bankers and thrifts -- including some of the largest in the U.S. -- are offering rates of 9.75% to 9.875%.    General Motors Corp.'s GMAC Mortgage Corp. unit, for instance, which is processing about $500 million of home loans, has offered a 9.75%, fixed 30-year rate for the past week. &quot;That's a fairly attractive rate -- call it aggressive, if you will -- but there are others maintaining the same price level,&quot; says Victor Schlesinger, GMAC Mortgage chairman.    The rates are at their lowest level since March, when the average fixed rate nationwide briefly dipped below 10%. According to HSH, the average rate available from the 2,000 lenders last week was 10.32%. A survey by Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. for the same week put the average rate at 10.22%. On Monday, the Veterans Administration cut its maximum rate for federally backed VA loans to 10% from 10.5%, its first drop since Feb. 1.    Generally, fixed rates have fallen steadily since August, when they hit their high for the year of nearly 11%, following the Federal Reserve Board's decision to boost the discount rate. Adjustable rates have remained flat at about 8.1%, according to the FHLMC survey. The trends contradict the consensus forecast of economists, who, like a dismal Greek chorus, have kept predicting that mortgage rates will rise, hammering home sales and starts. Indeed, most forecasters have overestimated mortgage rates -- and underestimated housing activity -- for the past several years.    &quot;Mortgage rates are indeed lower than expected,&quot; says David Seiders, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders. He attributes the decline to improvement in the bond market, where rates have fallen since August because of signs of slowing economic activity and weakening inflationary pressures.    Dennis Jacobe, chief economist for the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, notes that major changes have occurred in the mortgage market in the 1980s, exerting downward pressure on rates. In contrast to past decades, financial institutions are now allowed to pay any price for deposits and can offer adjustable-rate mortgages at initial, below-market teaser rates. Recent changes in capital-to-asset rules also are encouraging some lenders to make and keep mortgage loans in their portfolios. Moreover, there is tremendous demand for mortgages in the secondary market, where they are bundled into increasingly complex and popular derivative securities.    More downward pressure on rates comes from too many lenders chasing too few loans. Volume is down as much as 40% from 1986 and 1987, when lenders benefited from an explosion in refinancings, which are relatively rare now. Some mortgage bankers are making loans below the rates at which they could be sold, gambling that rates will fall further or that fees will offset any operating losses.    At the same time, so-called renegade thrifts are offering adjustable-rate loans at such deep discounts from market rates that the loans can't return a profit for one to two years, or more. These thrifts are often insolvent institutions desperately trying to generate cash flow with the fees from low-priced ARMs.    &quot;These thrifts are propped-up corpses, trying to generate volumes of business by going out with silly rates,&quot; says David Maxwell, chairman of the Federal National Mortgage Association. He predicts that borrowers who qualify at teaser rates of 6.875%, for instance, will almost certainly face 30% increases in monthly payments in the second and third year of some one-year adjustable loans, forcing some foreclosures.    Most housing economists, including Mr. Jacobe, still expect mortgage rates to increase moderately to about 11% or slightly more, either after the election or sometime in 1989.    But meanwhile, 1988 home sales are expected to be very robust. Existing-home sales will reach 3.5 million, near the decade's high, while new-home sales will total 660,000 to 665,000, about the same as in 1987, another strong year. Single-family starts are expected to top one million for the sixth year in a row.    Overall, &quot;it's been a very, very good year, relative to where we thought it would be,&quot; says John Tuccillo, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors. Mr. Tuccillo predicts existing-home sales in 1989 will drop 7% to 8%, to around 3.4 million, while other economists expect a similar decline in new-home sales. Single-family starts are expected to be about one million again; if they are, it will be the first time ever that starts have reached that level for seven consecutive years.    The biggest obstacle for sales and new construction is more likely to be home prices than mortgage rates. Prices are especially high in the Northeast, where sales have been declining. In California, only 23% of all households can afford the median-priced home in that state, down from 30% a year ago, according to the California Association of Realtors. In September, the state's median price was $174,094, up 18% from the year before. </TEXT></DOC>
