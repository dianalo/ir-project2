(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>SYSEMS IN CONCERTandM;My company recently completed a major research project to determine whatcritical issues computer-system management will face in the coming decade.andO;We sent researchers to institutions of all sizes--semiconductormanufacturers, newspapers, oil companies, food companies, systems integratorsworking for the government, and many others.andP;  There we interviewed a cadre ofsystem administrators, and learned about their concerns regarding themanagement of their corporate systems.andM;We found that a relatively unexciting matter--the backup and restoration offiles--was rated the most important issue by a wide margin of those surveyed.andO;This concern was followed by several others: problem identification andresolution, disaster recovery, administration of printers, user-accountadministration, network-resource accounting, security, and NFS performance.andO;We also discovered that the cost of managing systems was much greater thanthe managers had previously anticipated (see Figure 1).andM;What follows is an adjunct to our initial research.andP;  We posed the same coreset of questions to four managers, from four key industries, who areresponsible for managing computer systems in their respective largeorganizations.andP;  Although each of their environments is unique, these managersshare common concerns:andM;* System management is no longer an issue solely having to do with standalonesystems; it has very much become a networkwide concern.andM;* Administration and management of networks are time-consuming, tedious, andcomplex tasks.andM;* Today, highly trained, talented people--a valuable and criticalresource--are spending a great deal of time &quot;fighting fires&quot; and performing&quot;mundane&quot; tasks to manage the network.andM;* Networks are growing and changing quickly.andP;  It is a significant challengefor managers and administrators to keep up with the demands of this growth.andM;John Shelton, Director of Facilities and Computer Facilities, AdvancedDecision Systems, Mountain View, CA.andM;Describe your environment.andM;Advanced Decision Systems has a UNIX environment composed primarily of Sunworkstations located at two different sites.andP;  The configuration includes fourservers, 33 diskless clients, and 40 standalone workstations.andP;  Four of thestandalone Suns function as time-sharing computers supporting a network ofover 125 terminals.andM;Our Suns run SunOS 4.0.3; we generally track major Sun releases about sixmonths after their issue, and minor releases about a month after.andP;  Since manyof our workstations are used for LISP-based software development, Sun LISP(originally a Lucid product) and Franz Common LISP are widely used.andP;  We useLaTeX for documentation and research reports.andM;We have sufficient Ethernet traffic to keep five Ethernets fully occupied,and we use three additional Ethernets for non-UNIX-based computers.andP;  TheEthernets are connected through a single Internet Protocol gateway, which isconnected to the Internet through BARRnet (the Bay Area Regional ResearchNetwork).andP;  A ninth Ethernet in our remote office is connected to our homeoffice for research purposes through SURAnet (the Southeastern UniversitiesResearch Association Network) and the Internet.andP;  Networks are assigned fortraffic-related reasons, not because of departmental segregation.andM;Because many of our workstations labor on cutting-edge problems, theyregularly work on data sets that are hundreds of megabytes in size, and mustshare data.andP;  We cannot afford to install disk drives on all desktopworkstations, so our networks are swamped with traffic seldom seen at othersites.andM;Describe the hot issues or concerns you have regarding system management.andM;The issue that affects us the most on a daily basis is management of scarceresources.andP;  Despite having over 20 GB of disk space on-line, we constantlyrun short.andP;  Due to the way UNIX allocates file space, we may have hundreds ofmegabytes free at any time, and yet have no place to install new softwarepackages, since that free space is so fragmented.andM;Because of Ethernet bandwidth limitations, a single network is insufficientfor our needs.andP;  We constantly face the tradeoffs of establishing new networks(&quot;they cost money&quot;; &quot;traffic is slow through the gateway&quot;) versus adding newmachines to existing networks (and thus increasing the load on those nets).andM;As far as configuration management is concerned, even if we had only Sunequipment to support, we would still have trouble keeping all the software upo date.andP;  With other brands of UNIX-based workstations that are notSun-compatible, our problems are worse.andP;  We support both Sun-3s and Sun-4s.andO;What's more, subtle differences between SPARC-based machines require thatdifferent versions of SunOS be kept on-line; during major operating-systemup-grades, we must support both versions simultaneously, and that meansinstalling additional versions of our major applications as well.andM;Reliability is of major importance to us.andP;  In a diverse, heavily loadedenvironment, keeping all servers and networks simultaneously operationalbecomes increasingly difficult.andP;  Depsite the installation of new software tomake us more tolerant of failure, users lose several hours a week of uptime.andM;What are you doing, specifically, to manage your corporate system moreefficiently?andM;We are moving our disk storage away from desktop workstations to fewer,better-managed central file-servers.andP;  Desktop workstations will be configured&quot;dataless&quot; through the installation of small local disks to reduce theirnetwork loading.andP;  We are rewiring our buildings to support more Ethernets,and preparing for the widespread availability of FDDI.andM;With a heterogeneous network centered on high-bandwidth fiber and high-speedservers, network problems should decrease.andM;By trying to limit the software packages supported to those that runcompatibly on all our workstations, we hope to simplify configurationmanagement.andP;  We are also making the filesystem accessible company-wide, sothat we have to install only one copy of certain less-used applications.andM;With improved auto-mounting software, users can access these applicationswithout knowing their locations.andM;What is your personal philosophy or vision regarding the future of systemmanagement?andM;System management today, as before, requires UNIX wizards--a scarceresource--but doesn't use them effectively.andP;  Things go wrong often enoughthat the experts spend their time solving &quot;mundane&quot; problems instead ofimplementing new technology, or leading the user community to higherproductivity.andP;  I believe that in the future, system managers will work withpowerful tools to guide the growth powerful tools to guide the growth oftheir systems while they spend more time helping to bring new technology totheir users.andM;What are the key points of your ideal system-management plan?andM;The major changes to look for in the 1990s are improved, standardizedmechanisms for system management.andP;  These include:andM;* filesystems designed to allow managers to adjust overall parametersnetwork-wide, while the filesystem itself handles details;andM;* improved networking with greater speed and built-in reliability;andM;* standard application interfaces, allowing trivial installation ofapplications on diverse platforms;andM;* the introduction of artificial intelligence to system management;andM;* expert systems will replace managers in such tasks as disk management, userinstallation, configuration management, etc.andM;John Chisholm, John Chisholm Co., Menlo Park, CA.andM;Describe your environment.andM;The John Chisholm Company counsels computer manufacturers and softwaresuppliers on corporate, marketing, and product strategy.andP;  Through assignmentswith five vendors of UNIX-based systems, we have met with and interviewedusers, systems managers, and developers at nearly 100 UNIX installations,ranging from the largest UNIX sites in the world to developers whose entirehop is based on a single workstation.andP;  Our remarks reflect a composite offindings from these interviews.andM;Describe the hot issues or concerns you have regarding system management.andM;Data integrity and backup, maintaining high network-wide availability, andoperations consistency are among the key issues facing system managers as weenter the 1990s.andM;Maintaining data integrity and effective backup becomes more difficult as thenumber of separate storage locations on networks rises.andP;  Despite the dataintegrity advantages and economies of central storage on servers, userscontinue to opt for local storage on their workstations.andP;  Local storage notonly gives users control over their own data, but also eliminates user delaysfrom server I/O and network bottlenecks.andP;  Large data sets--such as videoimages, geometric models, and object code--are especially cumbersome totransmit over networks.andP;  The system manager's job in the 1990s is twofold:first, to provide an environment that encourages users to store datacentrally; second, to provide the means by which data integrity ismaintained, and backup for that data which remains distributed isaccomplished consistently.andM;As for system availability: with the advent of heterogeneous networks theissues of problem isolation, determination, and resolution are becoming muchmore difficult.andP;  Problems may arise in any of the following areas: physicalnetwork cabling, workstation or server software, workstation or servernetwork-interface hardware, bridges and routers tha link multiple LANs eitherin parallel or series, or in gateways that link LANs to wide-area networks.andM;A third concern is operations consistency.andP;  As UNIX networks becomeincreasingly heterogeneous, maintaining consisency of operation amongdifferent vendors' equipment will become a greater challenge.andP;  systemmanagers should not have to remember six different commands to add a new userto six different vendors' machines; the same set of commands should apply toall systems on a given network.andP;  Directories and path-names of commandsshould also be common across systems.andP;  Commands should make minimalassumptions about their environments, so they can run on many differentmachines.andM;What are you doing, specifically, to manage your corporate system moreefficiently?andM;With increased network heterogeneity, system managers are placing a premiumupon strict adherence to UNIX standards.andP;  System V Release 4 looks to be awinner in terms of market share, and the distance between it and OSF/1 and4.3BSD is widening.andP;  system managers are increasingly indifferent--evenhostile--toward vendors' proprietary &quot;enhancements&quot;, especially if thosefeatures replace standard capabilities.andP;  Such features account in part forthe limited acceptance that non-standard versions of UNIX have found fromUNIX users thus far.andM;More and more UNIX applications now support X Windows, allowing the use oflow-cost X terminals and &quot;dataless&quot; workstations (workstations with localstorage only for systems software).andP;  These devices not only provide processorand storage economies, but improve data integrity by making the server onceagain a central data repository.andM;Dividing a large network up into &quot;sub-networks&quot; bridged (or routed) togetherca improve performance for networks that are I/O-limited.andP;  Bridges improveperformance by keeping local traffic local; network traffic is filteredaccording to destination.andP;  Bridges also help isolate problems on individualsub-nets.andM;The new breed of servers and server accelerators that support more clientsand multiple networks simplify system management by eliminating the need toduplicate data sets on multiple, less powerful servers, and by allowing moreX Windows devices and dataless workstations to be used.andP;  Legato's Prestoservesubsystem, for example, improves SunServer NFS performance, allowing supportof many more clients per server.andM;NetFrame systems are typical of the new server architectures that supportsignificantly more clients than is possible with conventional,modified-workstation server architectures.andP;  Both approaches allow networktraffic to grow faster than network complexity.andM;What is your personal philosophy or vision regarding the future of systemmanagement?andM;Just as countries across the globe are discovering the effectiveness andefficiency of free market economies, so will computer networks, as weapproach the next century, evolve toward an efficient and self-regulating&quot;market economy&quot; means of allocating network resources.andP;  Applications andprocesses will &quot;bid&quot; for the use of processors, printers, and other scarcenetwork resources.andP;  Hgih-priority jobs (those with large budgets) will beserved quickly; lower-priority jobs will have to wait until the prevailingprice of the resources they require falls into a range they can afford(perhaps during off-peak hours).andP;  Accounting revenue will accrue to thedepartment or individual who owns each resource; network accounting willtrack and bill charges automatically.andM;There are several advantages to the &quot;free market&quot; network approach.andP;  As boththe resources and the number of users on a network increase, it becomes moreand more difficult--ultimately, impossible--to allocate them efficientlythrough centralized planning.andP;  Demand for processing in the client-serverworld is difficult to schedule, atomic, and interactive--fundamentallydifferent from the predictable, monolithic, batch world of mainframes.andP;  Fromthousands of micro-decisions made by individual processes competing forresources, a dynamic but stable environment emerges.andP;  Just as free enterpriseremovs the concerns of pricing disk drives from the federal government, sowill the network market free system managers of the task of allocating fixedresources.andP;  The system manager's job, instead, will evolve to ensuring thatresources are accessible and that there is no cheating--in other words, thatfree trade can occur.andP;  Pioneering research in the efficient allocation ofcomputing resources using market methods has been done by Dr. BernardoHuberman at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.andP;  Dr. Huberman calls thefield the &quot;ecology of computation&quot;.andM;What are the key points of your ideal system-management plan?andM;* Understand your customers' needs and goals; offer your users only what yourown department would be satisfied with.andM;* Remember the great economies of adhering to standards.andM;* whenever possible, change, test, and master only one variable in yournetwork-wide system at a time.andM;* Use every day to make the DP installation your manage more productive andeffective in some way; have trials under way continuously.andM;Brent Chapman, UNIX Operations Manager, Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, PaloAlto, CA.andM;Describe your environment.andM;Xerox PARC currently has over 200 UNIX-based machines, most of them Sunworkstations and servers.andP;  In addition, PARC has a Thinking MachinesConnection Machine, 100 or so Apple Macintoshes, about two dozen SymbolicsLISP systems, 50 or so Dorado workstations (designed and hand-built here atPARC), 400 or so Xerox 6085 Daybreak workstations, and assorted othercomputing systems, all networked together.andP;  We predict that our Sunpopulation will continue to grow at a rate of roughly 50 percent per year forat least another two years.andM;Describe the hot issues or concerns you have regarding system management.andM;For us these would include (in order of importance) networking, softwaredistribution, performance, electronic mail, and filesystem backup.andO;Networking is currently a major problem because our network has just casually&quot;evolved&quot; as new systems were purchased and installed, without much in theway of long-term planning.andP;  The result is chaos.andP;  We'll be undertaking amajor network overhaul in the next few months.andM;Software distribution is a hot topic, not so much for technical reasons asfor political ones.andP;  Researchers at PARC want bug-free platforms, but theyalso want absolute and final control over their computing environmnt, anddon't take kindly to support personnel changing that environment while&quot;fixing&quot; their machines.andP;  We're currently hashing out a way to balance theneed for rapid and widespread distribution of operating-system fixes andupgrades against the desire of the researchers to control their own machines.andM;Performance is always an issue.andP;  Everybody wants to know how to get the mostout of their existing equipment, and what new equipment could provide theirapplications with the most &quot;bang for the buck&quot;.andM;Electronic mail at PARC is complicated by the fact that we have threedifferent, more-or-less incompatible mail systems, each with a large userpopulation that isn't in any big hurry to migrate to another system.andO;Currently, filesystem backups are handled on a distributed, haphazard,per-work-group basis.andP;  Several groups are interested in centralizing ourbackups in hope of providing a more reliable system.andM;What are you doing, specifically, to manage your corporate system moreefficiently?andM;The first and most important thing that PARC has done is create aninstallation-wide &quot;Computing Infrastructure Committee&quot;.andP;  The CIC hasrepresentatives from each of the labs and support organizations, and has boththe charter and the resources to tackle PARC-wide computing problems, many ofwhich involve, directly or indirectly, system administration.andP;  A secondarybenefit of the CIc is that each of the labs gets a better idea of how otherlabs are solving particular problems, which keeps everybody from trying tore-invent the wheel.andM;The second thing we're doing is making a conscious commitment to training oursystem administrators and technicians as extensively as possible.andP;  We'replacing as much responsibility for day-to-day system administration aspossible in the hands of the labs personnel, who know the needs of their ownusers far better than any central support organization would.andP;  Finally, we'resimplifying, documenting, and automating everything we can in an effort toleverage the time of our various system administrators to the greatest extentpossible.andM;What is your personal philosophy or vision regarding the future of systemmanagement?andM;As UNIX systems become more common, better tools to help the new or casualadministrator will be introduced, and network administration (both in thesense of managing networks of machines and in the sense of managing theunderlying network itself) is going to become increasingly important.andM;What are the key points of your ideal system-management plan?andM;Several key questions should be asked in evaluating a system-management plan:andM;* Does it address the users' needs?andM;* Do I have enough resources (system administrators, funds, machines) tocarry it out?andM;* Does it give sufficient consideration to averting--and, failing that,dealing with--various disasters that might befall the system?andM;* It is flexible enough that it can be adapted to serve my needs as thesystem grows and the user population changes?andM;Roger M. Cooper, Deputy Administrator for Management, US Department ofAgriculture, Farmers Home Administration, Washington, DC.andM;Describe your environment.andM;The Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) operates approximately 2375 multiuserUNIX systems at 2100 geographically dispersed sites nationwide.andP;  Thesesystems each typically support from two to 16 users; users operate through aterminal emulator from about 9000 directly connected MS-DOS-based personalcomputers.andP;  The PCs also provide wide-area communications to an IBM 3090/600Glocated in Kansas City, using a 3270 emulator.andM;In addition to word processing, electronic mail, and transaction entry toremote mainframe accounting systems, applications we use perform loan-accountservicing functions; client-credit counseling functions; planning,programming, and budgeting functions; building-cost tracking support;architecture- and engineering-support functions; and inventory propertymanagement.andP;  All program areas of the agency use these computer systems.andM;Describe the hot issues or concerns you have regarding system management.andM;The vast number of systems we use creates enormous complexities whenever wetry to accomplish a task requiring standard configurations or procedures.andP;  Weexpend considerable time evaluating simple procedures (software distribution,for example) to ensure compatibility throughout the enterprise.andP;  We areconsidering several steps to overcome these problems by extending thecapability of ATandamp;T 3B2 systems (through the use of LANs, the use of Starlanto offload word processing to MS-DOS-based PCs, and so on).andM;The difficulty of exacting acceptable performance from UNIX in a &quot;remote&quot;multiuser, multi-operating-system environment remains an important issue.andO;This has to do with the limitations of the asynchronous interface versus thelimitations of the bus, and the fact that screen-display data must bere-interpreted at the desktop device.andP;  This is particularly a problem withbitmapped graphical displays.andP;  Local-area networking is needed to mitigatethis problem and may not totally resolve it appreciably.andP;  Local-areanetworking through a UNIX desktop operating system may be required, althoughsuch a scheme may limit the number of applications that can be run.andM;Another issue is the relative difficulty of providing performance adequatefor mixed, traditional, mainframe-compatible synchronous and asynchronouscommunications from a UNIX-based platform.andP;  This occasions exclusivelyexternal communications solutions (3270) emulation cards on the DOS-basedPCs), which adversely affects file distribution from our mainframes andelsewhere.andP;  It also hinders remote troubleshooting, automated configurationmanagement, and system administration.andM;Another hot issue relates to the hardware constraints of our UNIX-basedprocessors--ATandamp;T 3B2/400s--which cannot be scaled up from 4 MB of RAM.andO;Further, the 3B2 architecture has in no way become an industry standard, defacto or otherwise.andP;  This general product line is a dead-end for us.andP;  We arelooking at 80386/80486-based products.andM;What are you doing, specifically, to manage your corporate system moreefficiently?andM;We're trying to balance good planning with serving our existing clients.andO;Thus, we have instituted a strategic planning effort, the first stage ofwhich is being completed in the next few months.andP;  That will be followed by anInformation System Plan; we hope to develop the agency's first trulycorporate database and data dictionary over the next twelve months.andP;  Inaddition, we have had a contractor evaluate the capacity of our 3B2s while wehave assessed whether LANs can provide some flexibility for our systems.andO;Last year, we decided to purchase Oracle software.andP;  This will become ourstandard database platform.andP;  All new applications are being developed inOracle.andM;For the short term, we are purchasing the larger 3B2 units in order to expandour capacity.andP;  But we will be deciding on a comprehensive communicationarchitecture this year.andP;  This will affect our future choice of hardwareplatforms (including LANs).andM;We have to schedule our software distributions and system upgrades verycarefully, and expend extra resources for testing, certification, and releasecontrol.andP;  We provide, to the greatest extent possible, passive, automatedinstallation procedures, albeit by physical media.andP;  We specify requiredprocedures and standards to our various sites, and monitor compliance throughroutine on-site audits.andP;  We monitor system bottle-necks and take promptremedial action, such as code optimization.andP;  We insist on and get fastremedies for vendors' software problems.andM;We are working to accomplish these things in a more automated manner.andP;  Whilewe are working to automate our distribution channels, we are also arrangingfor remote dial-up for help functions.andP;  The current &quot;Help Desk&quot; is receivinga significant infusion of resources.andP;  The new technology will allow thedial-up into remote systems to conduct &quot;on-site&quot; help.andP;  We are graduallymoving toward more efficient distribution procedures as well.andM;What is your personal philosophy or vision regarding the future of systemmanagement?andM;Automate as much as possible with user-friendly, open systems; installmultiple platforms, but with an emphasis on compatibility; seek to establishefficient and cost-effective telecommunications using the FTS-2000 packetnetwork; develop simple-to-use applications that provide easy and quickaccess to data and reports; offer strong support for users.andM;What are the key points of your ideal system-management plan?andM;Farmers Home Administration is one of the largest financial institutions inthe country.andP;  Therefore, we need to automate our work as much as possible.andO;This includes developing applications, servicing loans, helping customers,and producing reports.andP;  As we automate, the applications need to becompletely &quot;user-friendly&quot;.andP;  With such a disparate organization, the helpwill seldom be on-site; therefore, to save time between calls, people need tobe comfortable with and able to use the automation directly.andP;  The geographicspread of the organization also creates a need for cost-efficientcommunication links between all the 3B2 systems and the mainframe.andM;Automated system-management solutions must be comprehensive.andP;  They should notonly cover multiple discrete functions, but also include system-environmentand performance reporting--both retrospective and prospective--and integratethe computing and telecommunications environment.andP;  Automatedsystem-management solutions must be pre-planned for modifiability.andO;System-management solutions must, above all, aim for user-friendly results.andO;Automated system-management solutions themselves must be user-friendly.andM;Despite the fact that the people we interviewed are from very differentindustries and types of network environments, they share several commonbeliefs:andM;* Standardization is very important to the successful management of complexnetworks.andM;* The ability for personnel and systems to remain &quot;flexible&quot; is important asthe environment continues to change rapidly.andM;* Finding new, more powerful, user-friendly management tools is essential forsuccess.andP;  These tools must provide managers and administrators withnetwork-wide solutions.andM;* Managers must focus on ensuring that administrators and users are highlyproductive.andM;* Good planning pays off.andP;  This planning must take a comprehensive (&quot;global&quot;)view of the network and its resources.andM;Carol Realini is vice president of marketing at Legato Systems Inc. of PaloAlto, CA, a supplier of network-administration products designed to enhanceand simplify mixed-vendor network computing.andP;  She was previously a directorof marketing at Ingres Corp.andP;  She also held several positions at AmdahlCorp., where she helped define, build, and install the first large productionUNIX systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
