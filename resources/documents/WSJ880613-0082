Traditionally, franchisees who have sued franchisers for such things as lack of support or termination without cause haven't fared well in court. That's because most franchise agreements give few rights to the franchisee.    But a growing number of courts are starting to accept the legal argument that franchisers have a responsibility beyond the contract to deal with franchisees in &quot;good faith.&quot;    A federal judge in Ohio recently refused to dismiss a lawsuit filed by some Burger Chef Systems Inc. franchisees, saying the relationship between a franchiser and a franchisee shouldn't be &quot;governed by the law of the jungle.&quot; Instead, he said, courts are striving toward a &quot;middle ground&quot; in which &quot;good-faith and reasonableness&quot; are the &quot;proper foundation for resolving franchise disputes.&quot; The case is expected to go to trial later this year.    An earlier case involved a Baskin-Robbins Inc. franchiser that exercised its contractual right to block a franchisee's attempt to sell its franchise. A Denver federal appeals court found the franchiser &quot;did not have the right to withhold consent unreasonably.&quot;    Such rulings are &quot;happening more and more,&quot; says Andrew C. Selden, chairman of the American Bar Association's forum committee on franchising. He adds: &quot;It is potentially the most powerful trend in the law governing the franchise relationship.&quot;    Still, franchisees shouldn't get too confident. Many state courts still haven't accepted the application of the good-faith doctrine to franchise disputes. Such a broadening is &quot;still a minority position,&quot; says Andrew J. Sherman, a Washington, D.C., franchise lawyer.    Parental-Leave Case   Alarms Small Business -   UNLIKE MANY large companies, most small businesses don't automatically grant parental leave to employees with newborn children. Now, a court battle in Harrisburg, Pa., could help to change that.    So far, small-business lobbying groups have thwarted efforts by federal legislators to force companies to give parental leave and have defeated or watered down most state efforts. Small companies claim they could be crippled if they were forced to give time off to several employees at once.    Unconvinced, the Harrisburg City Council in April passed an ordinance requiring local employers with 10 or more employees to give up to 12 weeks of unpaid parental leave. Harrisburg is believed to be the first U.S. city to pass such a statute -- and it is much stricter than any state legislation. For instance, Wisconsin passed a parental-leave law in April which provides for only six weeks of unpaid leave and exempts companies with fewer than 50 employees.    Harrisburg's mayor vetoed the bill, saying that small business &quot;will bear the brunt of costs&quot; for it. After the council overrode the veto, the mayor filed suit in state court against the city's human relations council, which is supposed to enforce the ordinance, alleging the measure &quot;exceeds the power granted to local governments.&quot; The court granted a temporary injunction preventing implementation of the law pending a ruling.    Small-business groups fear a court decision supporting the City Council could spur cities around the country to pass similar measures. &quot;It would blaze a new trail and others might follow,&quot; says a spokesman for the National Federation of Independent Business. &quot;We don't have the guns, the ammunition or the people power to be battling brush fires in municipalities all across the country.&quot;    NFIB Doesn't Endorse   Candidates -- Or Does It?    THE NATIONAL Federation of Independent Business says it &quot;has never endorsed a presidential candidate and won't this year&quot; because &quot;we're afraid of being cast in a partisan light.&quot;    Does that mean the country's largest small-business group will be impartial in this year's presidential election? You decide.    Although it won't officially endorse a candidate, NFIB says it will launch a &quot;major educational program&quot; detailing the positions of the expected Republican and Democratic nominees: George Bush and Michael Dukakis.    For example, the NFIB will point out in mailings to its more than a half-million members that Mr. Bush opposes tax increases and supports a lower capital-gains tax. The NFIB is &quot;very supportive&quot; of such positions, says President John Sloan.    The NFIB also will educate its members about Gov. Dukakis's support for a provision in the recently-vetoed trade bill that would have forced employers to give advance notice of plant closings and for a bill he signed into law in Massachusetts which mandates that employers in the state provide health benefits for their workers. Small-business owners opposed both measures. &quot;We're going to have to draw the picture that he isn't a friend of small business,&quot; Mr. Sloan says.    Doesn't such an educational campaign amount to a not-too-subtle endorsement of Vice President Bush? Says Mr. Sloan: &quot;I won't dispute that.&quot;    Odds and Ends   FOREIGN buyers, spurred largely by the falling dollar, are gobbling up more small businesses in the U.S. Geneva Cos., a Costa Mesa, Calif., mergers and acquisitions consultant to small and mid-sized companies, says it expects 30% of its deals this year to involve overseas buyers, up from 20% last year. . . . Entrepreneurs aren't risk-takers, according to a Long Island University study of nearly 300 small-business owners nationwide. The study found risk-taking ranked last among 12 entrepreneurial characteristics, while motivation and problem-solving topped the list. </TEXT></DOC>
