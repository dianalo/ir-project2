Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England,said regulators acted after finding evidence of &quot;fraudulentconduct on a world-wide scale&quot; by BCCI, or Bank of Credit andamp;Commerce International.</LP><TEXT>   At 1 p.m. Friday London time, as BCCI's board met inLuxembourg to attempt to restructure the bank, Britishofficials strode into BCCI branches across Britain andordered startled employees to leave. Within hours, regulatorsin many of the 62 other countries where BCCI has operationstook similar actions.   Two big questions loom in the wake of the crackdown: Whowill swallow the billions of dollars in losses to depositorsthat regulators expect to emerge? And how far and high willthe scandal reach in Washington, Paris, London and othercapitals where BCCI operated?   The first big loser is Abu Dhabi's Sheik Zayed al-Nahyan,who has pumped in more than $1 billion to keep BCCI afloatover the past 18 months, and to build his stake in the bankto a 77% holding. He and his government weren't informedbefore the crackdown, his lawyers said. Stung by the seizure,Sheik Zayed on Saturday left Abu Dhabi for &quot;a private visitto Europe,&quot; according to news agency reports. The reportseven suggested the emirate might try to oppose the regulatoryshutdown of BCCI.   In BCCI's annual report last year, Abu Dhabi said it was&quot;committed to maintaining the capital of the bank.&quot; But thesheik is unlikely to make good all the losses in thissituation, so people and institutions around the world willsuffer. These include the central banks of several developingcountries, commercial banks and brokerage houses that tradedwith BCCI and several hundred thousand individual depositors.   In Britain alone, BCCI has 120,000 depositors withestimated deposits in sterling of #250 million ($404.3million). Many of them are expatriate Pakistanis. Oneanguished depositor in London whose life savings were in BCCIsaid simply, &quot;I am buried.&quot;   Banks also will begin to feel pain this morning. Accordingto Bank of England officials, around $2 billion of BCCI'sLuxembourg unit's exposure are in interbank liabilities. Butbankers who did business with BCCI knew perfectly well thatthey were taking a risk, noted Robin Monro-Davies, managingdirector of the London-based rating agency IBCA Ltd., sothey're likely to get little sympathy.   Because of its complex structure, he said, &quot;BCCI was ahigh-risk institution which did not have a lender of lastresort. Any institution which had funds at BCCI was eitherbeing totally dilatory or taking a short-term risk and got itwrong. There will be no pressure to support thoseinstitutions.&quot;   Indeed, many British banks that steered clear of BCCI arelikely to complain, particularly if they're called upon topay for small depositors. In Britain, many depositors arelikely to qualify for maximum payouts from the U.K.'s DepositProtection Fund. The cost of indemnities could run to a fewhundred million pounds. The deposit fund doesn't have thatmuch cash available, so it is likely to impose a levy onbanks. Britain's Big Four clearing banks -- Lloyds Bank PLC,Barclays PLC, Midland Bank PLC and National Westminster BankPLC -- are likely to be hardest hit, as they probably willhave to contribute amounts proportionate to their share ofthe British banking market.   The central banks of several developing countries also arelikely to take losses on their millions of dollars of BCCIdeposits. Nigeria, for example, has been a favored BCCIcustomer in the past, and is likely to be a major loser inthis episode. Not only did Nigeria have substantial amountson deposit, but U.S. investigators suspect that Nigeria hasbeen used by BCCI as a money-laundering venue.   In the U.S., there won't be any call on the FederalDeposit Insurance fund because BCCI wasn't licensed to doretail business. Its California operations, for example,consisted of $40 million in foreign deposits and $140 millionin export-import loans. Stan Cardenas, California's seniordeputy superintendent of banks, said California has begunselling the loans and will use frozen foreign deposits to payits expenses for liquidating the office and reimbursingdepositors and California creditors.   Additional losers will emerge if the BCCI scandal spreads,as it appears likely to do. At least four grand juryinvestigations into BCCI's activities already are under wayin the U.S. In addition, the Bank of England said it hasturned over to Britain's Serious Fraud Office the PriceWaterhouse report on BCCI that prompted Friday's crackdown.That report provided evidence of fraud in areas controlledboth by BCCI's Luxembourg subsidiary and its Cayman Islandsoperation.   In the past, investigators have been stymied by a lack ofcooperation by BCCI, its auditors and its regulators. Indeed,earlier this year, Manhattan District Attorney RobertMorgenthau, who was almost alone in investigating BCCI'scovert investments in U.S. banks and its unorthodox businessmethods, complained that he wasn't getting adequatecooperation from the Bank of England.   The Morgenthau investigation and others promise to movemore swiftly now that regulators have seized some of BCCI'smost important records. Also, current and former BCCIstaffers, many of them now unemployed, are expected to bemore willing to talk. A wave of additional regulatory andlegal actions against BCCI and its coterie now appearslikely.   Ironically, Friday's crackdown isn't expected to affectthe operations of First American Bankshares Inc., the biggestWashington bank holding company, because regulators alreadyordered BCCI to sell its controlling interest in FirstAmerican. But Washington &quot;superlawyer&quot; Clark Clifford and hispartner Robert Altman, who still serve as First American'schairman and president, respectively, will continue to facehard questions from investigators about their conduct onbehalf of BCCI and in the management of First American.   The Bank of England's Mr. Leigh-Pemberton declined to gointo detail, but said BCCI's wrongdoing included &quot;concealmentof losses, false accounting and other devices which have beenhighly deceptive.&quot; BCCI had been unsuccessful &quot;both in itslending operations and its treasury operations, and theextent of this failure has been concealed,&quot; he affirmed.   For years, the Bank of England had watched BCCI nervously,but hadn't acted. It cracked down Friday, it said, to&quot;safeguard the interests of depositors, creditors and theowners of the bank.&quot;   In addition to Price Waterhouse's finding of world-widefraud, authorities acted when they did because of BCCI'smounting losses, Luxembourg officials said. BCCI'sstill-unpublished 1990 results, bank insiders said over theweekend, are expected to show losses of more than $800million. According to British regulators, fictitious loansand payments in the form of loans with no expectation ofrecovery were among the mechanisms used to try to conceal theshortfall.   The timing of Friday's operation, while European financialmarkets were open, was dictated in part by Luxembourg legalregulations and the need to move rapidly to safeguarddepositors. In addition, the action was taken on the Muslimsabbath, when many of the Arab banks likely to lose bigdeposits were closed. Finally, the swoop's timing permittedthe closure of a bank with a great deal of dollar-denominatedbusiness before the opening of U.S. markets after the July 4holiday.   Despite Friday's crackdown, BCCI continues to operate in anumber of nations. In Hong Kong and Brazil, for example,authorities said they regarded local BCCI units as separatefrom the main group and that they were allowing them to stayopen. But the closure of BCCI operations in many importantmarkets is likely to have a chilling effect on its remainingbusiness. The Bank of England said it had informed&quot;authorities in all other countries in which the BCCI groupoperates&quot; of its reasons for seizing the bank and had&quot;invited them to consider the need for action in theirjurisdictions.&quot;   ---                   A Short but Dark History                                                                                                          1972 -- Agha Hasan Abedi, fearful of bank nationalizationin his native Pakistan, sets up Bank of Credit andamp; CommerceInternational with $10 million of capital in Luxembourg.                                                                                                          1978 -- Mr. Abedi, with the help of former Carteradministration official Bert Lance, tries to acquireFinancial General Bankshares Inc., a Washington, D.C.-basedbank holding company.                                                                                                          1981 -- After an investigation by the Federal Reserve, agroup of Arab investors -- advised by Mr. Abedi and BCCI --is allowed to acquire Financial General Bankshares, which isrenamed First American Bankshares.
