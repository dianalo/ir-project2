The five have been competing against three 3A sizedschools -- Logan, Mission San Jose and Newark Memorial -- in a losing battlefor the past few years.;    &quot;It had gotten to the point where we needed tolook for schools our own size to compete against,&quot; Washington Principal DarrylTalken said. &quot;Our enrollment is not going to go up and I had to be able tooffer my coaches and students the opportunity to compete for a league title.It had to be done.&quot;;    The next step in is for the 2A realigning committee tomeet (they are scheduled to do so today).;    While nothing is official untilthe committee makes it so, a natural marriage would likely occur between theMVAL and the Hayward Area Athletic League, where the five 2A schools have alsopetitioned to come out from under the shadow cast down by the three 3A schoolsin that league.;    If the two leagues, which are geographically closer thanany other leagues, were to merge their 2A and 3A schools, it would mean a10-team 2A league and a six-team 3A league. The names of the leagues would beadopted by school administrators.;    The 2A league would consist of American,Irvington, Kennedy, Moreau and Washington from the MVAL and Arroyo, Dublin,Hayward, San Lorenzo and Tennyson from the HAAL. The 3A league would be Logan,Mission San Jose and Newark Memorial from the MVAL and Castro Valley, Mt. Edenand San Leandro, currently of the HAAL.;    &quot;The problem is that when we getto the playoffs now we're a 2A school having to play against 3A schools,&quot;Talken said. &quot;This move would eliminate that and allow us to play against ourown size schools in the playoffs.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PEDRO GOMEZ, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910501  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  400  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 1, 199100122192,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
