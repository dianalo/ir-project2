Introduction </ITAG>The 200th Anniversaries of the signing and ratification of the United StatesConstitution, the creation of the three branches of government, and theadoption of the Bill of Rights present important opportunities to encouragerenewed reflection about, education on, and public interest in the principlesand foundations of constitutional government. In 1976, we celebrated theBicentennial of the Declaration of Independence, the document which setforth the principles of representative government. In 1987, we began thecommemoration of the Constitution which was designed to put those principlesinto practice and which has provided a stable and workable plan of governmentfor the past 200 years.A key element in that commemoration should be the encouragement of renewedvigor in the teaching of the origins and fundamentals of the Constitutionand American government in our elementary and secondary schools. The Commission'sEducational Grant Program is designed to improve knowledge and understandingof the Constitution through the funding of teacher conferences and institutes,other exemplary programs, and the development of instructional materialsfor use in elementary and secondary schools. In addition, the Commissionseeks proposals from organizations which will demonstrate innovative methodsfor using existing materials, including those materials developed underprevious grants from the Commission. During the completed three roundsof the Grant Program, the Commission received 650 applications requestingover $32 million in project funding. Following its congressional mandate, the  Commission  funded  66 (+ 1988 Round 2) projects and awarded approximately$4.4 million in discretionary grant assistance. Applicants are urged to read the program announcement carefully beforesubmitting a proposal to the Commission. The program is very competitiveand, therefore, only a small percentage of all applicants will receiveassistance. Funding of grant proposals in FY '89 is contingent upon a final appropriationby Congress. Preparation of an application is at an applicant's own expenseand risk; the Commission cannot provide reimbursement for any proposalpreparation expenses. Duties of the Commission The Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution (theCommission) was established by Pub. L. 98-101 Stat. 719, and signed bythe President on September 29, 1983. Commission activities are governedby a 23 member Commission; the Honorable Warren E. Burger, Chief Justiceof the United States, 1969-1986, serves as Chairman. The Commission was created to promote and coordinate activities commemoratingthe 200th Anniversary of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.Section 6 of Pub. L. 98-101 charges the Commission with the following duties:andbullet; To plan and develop activities appropriate to commemorate thebicentennial of the Constitution, including a limited number of programsto be undertaken by the Federal Government seeking to harmonize and balancethe important goals of ceremony and celebration with the equally importantgoals of scholarship and education. andbullet; To encourage private organizations, and State and local governmentsto organize and participate in bicentennial activities commemorating orexamining the drafting, ratification and history of the Constitution andthe specific features of the document. andbullet; To coordinate, generally, activities throughout the United States.andbullet; To serve as a clearinghouse for the collection and disseminationof information about bicentennial events and plans. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. The Program Mandate </ITAG>The Commission's Educational Grant Program invites proposals for projectsdesigned to provide elementary and secondary school students with a strengthenedunderstanding of the Constitution, its antecedents, provisions, structure,and history. The Commission believes that an effective way to reach thestudents is through their teachers and, therefore, invites proposals whichemphasize teacher training. Proposed programs should demonstrate how studentswill benefit and should result in instructional ideas, methods, and materialswhich teachers can share with others.In Pub. L. 98-101, 97 Stat. 719, under Section 6(a), the Commission isauthorized to give due consideration to_ (1) The historical setting in which the Constitution was developed andratified, including such antecedents as the Federalist Papers, the Articlesof Confederation, and the ratification debates in the States; (2) The contribution of diverse ethnic and racial groups; (3) The relationship and historical development of the three branches ofgovernment; (4) The importance of activities concerning the Constitution and citizenshipeducation throughout all of the States regardless of when such State achievedstatehood; (5) The unique achievements and contributions of the participants in theConstitutional Convention of 1787 and the State ratification proceedings;(6) The diverse legal and philosophical views regarding the Constitution;(7) The need for reflection upon both academic and scholarly views of theConstitution and the principle that the document must be understood bythe general public; (8) The substantive provisions of the Constitution itself; (9) The impact of the Constitution on American life and government; (10) The need to encourage appropriate educational curriculums designedto educate students at all levels of learning on the drafting, ratification,and history of the Constitution and the specific provisions of that document;and (11) The significance of the principles and institutions of the Constitutionto other nations and their citizens. Applicants should keep in mind that within the mandate of the Commission,the origins, history, and enduring principles of the Constitution are ofparamount importance, as against any particular controversies or issuesof the moment. The Commission cannot support any proposal which arguesfor a partisan or ideological point of view.<ITAG tagnum="21">Focus should be the men and events of 1787, not controversial interpretationsof 1987; the Federalist Papers and the ratification debates in the States,not the textbooks of modern law schools; the substantive provisions ofour Nation's foundational document, not the proposed legislative agendaof any single party or group. (Senate Report No. 98-68) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">III. Priority Subject Areas for Grants in FY '89 </ITAG>The Commission encourages proposals which correspond to themes highlightedby the Commission during its five-year commemorative plan. The Commissionhas outlined a program for the Constitution's Bicentennial, and identifieda specific anniversary and provided a specific focus for each year. In1987, the emphasis was on the writing and signing of the Constitution.In 1988, the focus was on the ratification of the Constitution and thedevelopment of the Legislative Branch. The focus for the ensuing threeyears is as follows: 1989: The study of Congress will continue since 1989 marks the 200th anniversaryof the first congressional elections. The Executive Branch also will receivespecial emphasis as we commemorate the 200th anniversaries of the firstpresidential inauguration and the first administration. 1990: The Bicentennial of the first session of the Supreme Court marksan appropriate year to focus on the Judiciary and its historical development.1991: The final year of the bicentennial commemoration is designated fora study of the Bill of Rights, adopted in 1791, and subsequent amendmentsadopted throughout our history. In its 1989 Educational Grant Program, the Commission continues to encourageproject proposals which focus on the study of the Legislative and the ExecutiveBranches; for those projects which will take effect in the 1989-90 schoolyear, the Commission welcomes proposals which focus on the Judiciary. Thetopic of any proposal should, to some degree, be dictated by when the projectwill go into effect.The doctrine of separation of powers should be addressed in any proposaldealing with the three branches of government. Although all three branchesmay be involved in the treatment of an issue, again the major focus ofa proposal submitted to the 1989 Grant Program should be on the ExecutiveBranch or the Judiciary. One effective approach to these themes is to compare their operation inrecent times with what was contemplated by those who drafted and ratifiedthe Constitution and its amendments. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Who May Apply and What May Be Funded </ITAG>The Commission is authorized to accept applications from and award grantsto: andbullet; Local Educational Agencies; andbullet; Private Elementary and Secondary Schools; andbullet; Private Organizations; andbullet; Individuals; and andbullet; State and Local Public Agencies in the United States. Colleges, Universities, and Adult Education Programs within the above categoriesare eligible to apply provided that the proposed project or program isdesigned principally for use in elementary and secondary schools. The Commissionalso encourages proposals from non-traditional educational organizationsand those concerned with ethnic and minority interests, constituents forwhom English is a second language, and other special interest organizations,such as those concerned with the learning disabled and hearing impaired.Awards will not be made to profit-making organizations. Non-profit organizationsare requested to submit proof of their exempt status. The Commission is authorized to make awards to organizations which willdevelop educational activities and programs, and instructional materialson the Constitution and the Bill of Rights for use in the elementary andsecondary schools. The Commission also is authorized by Congress to implement the NationalBicentennial Competition on the Constitution and Bill of Rights, a continuingprogram developed by the Center for Civic Education. No discretionary grants,however, will be awarded for that program. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Exemplary Projects </ITAG>The bicentennial commemoration has inspired an effort to stress civic educationin the schools. The Commission urges schools, school districts, or organizationswhich have established highly successful educational programs on the Constitutionor civic literacy to apply for limited funding to expand, replicate, orcontinue them. These programs could serve as models which, with a well-developeddissemination plan, will increase the availability of teaching materialsand methods. A number of these programs are currently conducted in elementary and secondaryschools across the country. Leaders of these programs include educators,representatives of key community groups, bar associations, law enforcementagencies, and public service agencies. Through effective use of such existingprograms, education on the Constitution and civic literacy in the nation'sschools would be significantly enhanced. In order to be eligible for funding as an exemplary project, applicantsmust provide written evidence of past program accomplishments, evidenceof project recognition by others, and documentation of continued commitmentto the project. There also must be evidence of an established plan of disseminationto other schools, school districts, and educational associations and institutions;in addition, the project must be made available to the Commission. Programsof this nature should link the understanding of the history and principlesof the Constitution to civic responsibility today through individual classroomor school-wide projects. These programs may include co-curricular and extra-curricularlearning activities as well as curricular studies. The Commission anticipates funding a limited number of proposals of thisnature for project support under the 1989 Educational Grant Program. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. In-Service Instruction </ITAG>To help ensure a minimum level of basic teacher instruction on how to teachthe Constitution to a maximum number of teachers, the Commission invitesproposals from school districts or consortia of school districts whichwill develop and implement concentrated in-service training sessions forteachers from a school or school district. The Commission believes thatthrough a cooperative effort, regional school districts can develop a networkwhereby resources can be combined for greater effectiveness. Scholarlyinput, materials, and opportunities can be shared so that small and largedistricts alike will have the optimum training available. Through single-daytraining or through on-going supplemental training during the course ofthe school year, teachers can be provided with information and tools forteaching the concepts inherent in the Constitution.Because grant support for in-service training is relatively modest, applicantswho provide documented in-kind or cash match resources will be given priorityconsideration. Applicants seeking funding for in-service training are urgedto detail their project in as short a narrative as possible. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Diverse Activities </ITAG>Many Formats Possible The Commission is often asked to provide examples of fundable projectsas guidance for prospective applicants. The Commission encourages a widerange of project activities employing a variety of formats using the fundingemphases and themes mentioned above. We look to applicants to use theirown imagination in designing a project. At the back of this package aresynopses of all the projects which have received funding support from theCommission in the first two years of the Commission's Educational GrantProgram. These projects might serve as points of departure for the developmentof a proposal for this grant cycle. It is very important that in the proposal narrative, heavy emphasis beplaced on the widespread benefits of the developed program. The programshould reach more than the immediate project participants. Regardless ofthe specific project proposed, the result should be to develop studentunderstanding of the history and principles of the Constitution, improvethe ability of teachers to teach those topics, and provide the resourcesand methods to implement those skills. <ITAG tagnum="84">VIII. What Activities May Not be Funded </ITAG>Real property acquisition, construction, and research undertaken in pursuitof an academic degree may not be assisted with Commission funding. TheCommission will not fund proposals which espouse partisan political orsectarian religious views or attack others, legislative proposals or proposalsto intervene in on-going disputes, or proposals that would bring the Commissioninto the policy-making processes of any government or government agency.Grant money may not be used as honoraria for individuals who simply speakat the conferences or institutes. (This restriction does not prohibit fundsfrom being used to support individuals whose broader participation in aconference or institute includes a speech.) <ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Budget Information </ITAG>All costs must be reasonable, necessary to accomplish program objectives,allowable in terms of the applicable federal cost principles, auditable,and incurred during the project period. Charges to the project of itemssuch as salaries, fringe benefits, travel, and contractual services mustconform to the written policies and established practices of the applicantorganization. The Commission encourages applications that include in-kind services orother sources of funding. Preference will be given to applicants who proposein-kind services in the project budgets. <ITAG tagnum="81">Allowable Costs </ITAG>Allowable project costs include:<ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Salaries and wages for key personnel, administrative assistants,and secretaries; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Fringe benefits; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Consultant fees; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Necessary and reasonable travel expenses (including subsistencecosts when traveling) for key personnel and participants; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Stipends for participants; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Supplies and materials used in the project; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Project-related services such as cost of duplication andprinting, long-distance telephone, equipment rental (or purchase if lessexpensive), postage, and other services not included in the other categoriesor in the indirect cost pool and related to the project objectives.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It is important to incorporate donated, in-kind, or cash contributionsinto the overall budget. <ITAG tagnum="84">X. Review Process: Introduction </ITAG>Although applicants must follow the format prescribed under ``PROPOSALCONTENT'' (which follows), no proposal should simply mirror the contentof this announcement. It also is particularly important that proposalsbe free of jargon and technical language; they must be clear in both organizationand expression. The discussion of the judging process in this section mayhelp the applicant prepare a stronger proposal. Applicants must submit a narrative of their proposal which is strictlylimited to fifteen (15) double-spaced pages excluding the project budgetexplanation and appendix items. Proposals for in-service training shouldbe shorter. Applicants may submit more than one proposal; each will beassessed independently.Administrative and Merit Review of Applications. The review process thatthe Commission has established is highly competitive and involves severalsteps. Initially, each application is given an administrative review toensure that all the necessary items are included in the package. Second,a number of external panels composed of educators, curriculum specialists,and scholars independently review and comment on proposals which are categoricallyrelated. Third, the Commission Grant Staff conducts its own substantivereview of the applications. Upon completion of the first three steps, the Grant Staff meets with theexternal panelists to discuss applications on their merits; on the basisof these deliberations, the Staff puts together a tentative list of fundableproposals. In preparing this list, the Staff will, on occasion, seek theadvice of special consultants. All project budgets are reviewed independentlyby the Office of Justice Programs of the U.S. Department of Justice. Afinal group of recommended applications is then selected from the top ratedproposals and presented to the Commission's Advisory Committee for EducationalProjects for funding approval. This Advisory Committee considers the proposalsand makes the final funding decisions. The merit review of each application will focus on the relative significanceand importance of proposals. Applicants should be sure to discuss: (1)The subject matter and educational needs being addressed; (2) the proposedactivities in some detail; (3) the desired result or outcome of the project.As stated above, the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed projectwill affect a much larger audience than the immediate participants. A wellthought out dissemination plan, therefore, should be included in the proposaland will be given weight in the overall review of proposals. Important,as well, is the inclusion of a self-evaluation plan; applicants are encouragedto include an explanation of a plan to evaluate the program and any materialsdeveloped during the course of the program. This will ensure that the disseminationof a program will be of use to others. After a thorough review of the applications, Commission staff may telephoneapplicants in order to verify or clarify both substantive and budgetaryinformation. The Commission also may contact others who are in a positionto know the applicant's work and plans, or who would be affected by theproject. Commissioners, Commission staff, and external reviewers will remove themselvesfrom consideration of any application for a grant which might present theappearance of a conflict of interest. Individuals who believe they mayhave a potential conflict of interest arising from present or prior associationwith an applicant or for any other reason shall bring the situation tothe attention of the Commission's Counsel for guidance. Except in an instance in which some clarification of a grant proposal isneeded to facilitate the evaluation, the Grant Staff is not allowed todiscuss with applicants the status of a proposal. The staff is not at libertyto divulge the results of preliminary and tentative evaluations duringany step of the review process. Given the meticulous nature of the evaluationprocedures, involving several steps and several distinct groups of people,the divulging of such incomplete information may be more deceptive thanhelpful. Comments about proposals will only be made available to the applicantsafter the final award decisions have been made. Throughout the review process, external reviewers and Commission staffwill make judgments about the extent to which a project will provide elementaryand secondary school teachers and students with a strengthened understandingof the Constitution and Bill of Rights. <ITAG tagnum="84">XI. Selection Criteria </ITAG>The Commission has developed the following criteria as general guidelinesfor judging all project proposals. andbullet; The project is designed to strengthen teachers' capacity to understandand teach the Constitution, its antecedents, provisions, structure, andhistory while benefitting students in an academically sound way appropriatefor the age group toward which it is directed. (15 points) andbullet; Potential of the project to make effective and appropriate useof existing and proven curricular materials, including those made availablethrough Commission sponsorship and the Bicentennial Educational Grant Program.(5 points) andbullet; The project is cost-effective in that expenditures are reasonableand appropriate to the scope of the project. (5 points) andbullet; The project must demonstrate the potential for affecting a muchwider audience than the immediate project participants. (10 points) andbullet; The project represents an improvement upon existing teaching methods.(5 points)andbullet; Applicants have the capacity to carry out the project as evidencedby:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Academic and administrative qualifications of the project personnel;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Quality of project design; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Soundness of project management plan.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">(10 points) Unfortunately, the Commission cannot fund projects, however commendablein other ways, which do not conform to its mandate and program emphases.Please, therefore, pay close attention to the Commission's guidelines whenwriting a proposal. The decision to award funding assistance is solely within the discretionof the Commission based upon its judgment of how best to fulfill the statutorypurposes of the Grant Program. Funding decisions Cannot be appealed. The Commission may, as it has in the past, have additional funding availableat the completion of the first round and will announce a second round grantcompetition. Applicants not receiving funding in the first round competitionmay re-submit their proposals for a later evaluation cycle. Such re-submittedapplications, however, will receive no special consideration; they mustbe submitted as new applications and will be evaluated on the same footingas all other applications. <ITAG tagnum="84">XII. Commission Assistance </ITAG>The Grant Staff of the Commission is available to any organization or individualin the process of writing a project proposal. The Commission has attempted to make the application procedure and processas simple as possible. Nevertheless, applicants may have some questionsboth technical and general about completing the application for federalassistance. The Grant Staff of the Commission urges you to call them forassistance. Once an application is submitted to the Commission, changescannot be made; it is to your advantage, therefore, to make sure that theapplication is properly completed. The staff is permitted to give technicalassistance to those who are writing grant proposals. When you are writing a proposal, especially if the project calls for specialparticipants such as nationally known scholars or curriculum developers,make sure that these participants have at least tentatively committed toparticipate in the project, contingent upon funding. Also, include anyletters of commitment from cosponsoring organizations or supporting organizations.A project will be given more credence if participants or organizationshave been approached and tentative commitments have been made. <ITAG tagnum="85">XIII.
