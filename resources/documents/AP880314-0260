By coincidence, that mont also saw a serious rift inU.S.-Israeli relations when Jonathan Jay Pollard, acounterterrorism expert at the Naval Investigative Service wasarrested as a spy for Israel.   An examination of what led up to the events of November 1985provides insight into the relationship between Israel and theUnited States and the interaction between officials from the twocountries.   Two independent counsels, James McKay and Lawrence Walsh, areinvestigating the Iraqi pipeline proposal and the Iran-Contraaffair, respectively. They have begun to share information in asearch for links between the cases.   What is clear is that at least two of the same people dealt withboth cases; private citizens used their friendships with governmentofficials to make money, and international policy was affected bybusiness interests.   At the same time that Israelis were shipping U.S.-made weaponsto Iran in an effort to free American hostages in Lebanon,businessmen were enlisting friends at the highest levels of bothgovernments to guarantee the safety of a proposed Iraq oil pipelinefrom Israeli bombing attacks.   Late in the year, the Israelis gave White House aide Oliver L.North free rein over $850,000 in excess profit from the Iranianarms sales. Most of that money went to the Nicaraguan Contras,according to a congressional report.   Here is a loose chronology:   On November 21, 1985, North worked frantically in his NationalSecurity Council office to sort out foul-ups in the plan to haveIsrael ship 80 Hawk missiles to Iran as part of a deal to releasesix American hostages held by pro-Iranian groups in Lebanon.   Desperate for help, he called his boss, Robert C. McFarlane,then national security adviser, the State Department and the CIA.   The Israelis had flown the first batch of U.S.-made weapons toTehran in late August, leading to freedom for hostage Benjamin Weirin September. Details for future shipments were ironed out by Northand Amiram Nir, an aide to Shimon Peres, then Israel's primeminister.   Handling operational details on the Israeli side was AdolphSchwimmer, an arms dealer, founder of Israel Aircraft Industriesand one of Peres' closest friends.   President Reagan had given his blessing to the project.   On Nov. 22, an Iranian middleman transferred $24 million _payment for 80 Hawks _ into Swiss bank accounts controlled by anIsraeli intermediary.   North had ordered Schwimmer to place $1 million in a LakeResources account run by private businessmen working with North.The money was to cover transportation costs of flying the missilesfrom Israel to Iran.   Ultimately, only 18 of the 80 Hawks were flown to Tehran on Nov.24. Shipments were halted because the Iranians complained they hadbeen cheated on the kind of missiles sent to them; no hostages werereleased.   Because only 18 Hawks were delivered, more than $800,000remained in bank accounts under North's supervision. That money wasspent on the Nicaraguan Contras _ the first diversion of money tothe rebels, and it appears to derive from Israeli funds, acongressional report on the Iran-Contra affair says.   ``North testified that in early 1986 he told the Israelis thatthe money had been used `for the purpose of the Contras' and theyacquiesced,'' the report said. The Israelis said North told themDec. 6, 1985, that he intended to use proceeds from the Iran armssales to help the Contras.   American investigators have been unable to question Israeliofficials face-to-face about the Iran-Contra case. Yossi Gal, aspokesman at the Israeli Embassy, did not return telephone callsasking about the diversion.   The Israelis gave the congressional Iran-Contra committeeswritten chronologies, but no one was interviewed in person. Walshhas not been able to question Israelis, either.   About the time the missiles were en route to Iran, anotherproject that involved Israel and the United States came to a boil:the proposal by the Bechtel Group Inc. and Swiss businessman BruceRappaport to build a $1 billion, 540-mile pipeline to run fromIraq's Kirkuk oil fields to the Jordanian port of Aqaba. The routeran near the Israeli border.   Rappaport, who has a relationship with Peres that goes back 45years, had hired as his attorney, E. Robert Wallach, a SanFranciscan with close ties to Attorney General Edwin Meese.   On Sept. 19, 1985, four days after hostage Weir was freed, Pereswrote Meese asking the attorney general to advise Secretary ofState George P. Shultz about Israel's interest in the pipeline.   Promoters of the project planned to pay Israel to keep Jerusalemfrom bombing the pipeline in the territory of its enemy, Iraq.   A week later, Wallach wrote Meese about Rappaport's purportedarrangement to pay Israel _ and Peres' Labor Party.   The debt apparently involved Israel's role in freeing Weir, thememo said. Rappaport ``indicates that Peres emphatically indicatedthat the release of Weir was a result of the state of Israel, andno one else,'' Wallach wrote.   In his memo, Wallach says ``there is a feeling that the U.S.`owes' and that the accomplishment of this project, as outlined inmy memo, is appropriate.''   Peres has denied he or his party received bribes; he has calledthe idea ``nonsense.'' The Israeli government supported theproject, however, he said.   On Oct. 7, Meese recommended that Peres discuss the pipelinewith McFarlane who is ``thoroughly familiar with the subject.''McFarlane had assigned NSC aide David Wigg to quarterback U.S.involvement in the pipeline.   When Peres visited the United States Oct. 16-Oct. 12, he metwith McFarlene and Wigg about the pipeline, according to sourcesquoted by The Washington Post.   On Nov. 20, Peres sent McFarlane a letter saying the Israeligovernment was prepared to ``extend guarantees'' that the pipelinewould not be touched.   Within weeks, a proposal surfaced which called for the Pentagonto make secret payments to Israel to prevent a pipeline bombing.   McFarlane's successor, John M. Poindexter, eventually ended theNSC involvement in the pipeline at year's end. It was never built.   Meanwhile, the Justice Department continues to investigate theunrelated Pollard case.   Michael Ledeen, a former NSC consultant, said he thinks thePollard case may have encouraged red-faced Israelis to keep pushingthe Iran initiative on the assumption it would lead to release ofmore American hostages in Lebanon, thus pleasing the United States.   An Israeli source with access to top officials in his governmentsays Peres indicated that Jerusalem thought it could earnforgiveness for the Pollard affair if hostages were freed. Thesource spoke on condition he remain anonymous.   Peres publicly apologized to the United States on Dec. 1, 1985.   Pollard pleaded guilty to charges he sold secret militarydocuments to Israel and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Hiswife, Anne Henderson-Pollard, was sentenced to five years for beingan accessory.   Israeli Air Force Brig. Gen. Aviem Sella was indicted, and threeother Israelis were named as co-conspirators in the espionagenetwork operating inside the United States.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 20</NOTE></DOC>
