They also urged the administration of President Bush to do all itcould to obtain the release of their husbands, seized Jan. 24, 1987,from the campus of the American-affiliated Beirut UniversityCollege, where they taught.   ``We appeal to you (kidnappers) again to release our lovedones,'' said Virginia Rose Steen, wife of journalism professor AlannSteen of Boston. ``Two years have passed since we saw our husbandsabducted from this campus.''   The women held a news conference on the campus to mark the secondanniversary of the kidnappings.   Jesse Turner, a mathematics professor from Boise, Idaho, andRobert Polhill, a business professor from New York City, wereabducted with Steen by unidentified gunmen posing as Lebanese police.   Mithileshwar Singh, an Indian citizen and U.S. resident who was avisiting professor of finance at the college, also was seized thatday but since has been freed.   Fifteen foreigners, including nine Americans, are held hostage inLebanon. The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   Mrs. Steen said the women had not yet made contact with the Bushadministration but hoped ``the new people with fresh ideas ... woulddo everything they possibly can to end this for all the hostages.''   Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, believed made upof Moslem extremists, claimed responsibility for the kidnappings.   The group initially demanded that Israel free 400 Arab prisonersin return for the educators. Israel has refused to consider thedemand and Washington said it would not pressure the Jewish state tochange its position.   The kidnappers, in a statement in September, appeared to softentheir demand by hinting they would consider freeing the men if theUnited States backed a Palestinian uprising against Israelioccupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   ``Let us end this horror now and make a positive step out of it.... Let them love, breath and walk as you do,'' Mrs. Steen said.   Polhill's wife, Feryal, said, ``Please release them and allowthem to help you. They will tell the world of your grievences andwill help you continue achieve your aims.''   Badr Turner said of her husband, ``I wish he would return homesoon, along with his colleagues.''   Turner's 19-month-old daughter, Joanne, who was born during hiscaptivity, sat in her mother's lap and waved to television cameras,saying: ``Hello, daddy.''   Mrs. Steen said there had been no word from the kidnappedprofessors since Oct. 3, when Singh was released. At the time, thekidnappers released pictures showing the others saying goodbye toSingh.</TEXT></DOC>
