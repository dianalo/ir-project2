Takeshita, who heads the governing Liberal Democratic Party,received the loan from Recruit Co. and repaid it several monthslater, Kyodo News Service and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. said.   They said officials in Takeshita's office confirmed the loan butdid not disclose the terms of its repayment.   Takeshita did not mention the loan when he told a Parliamentcommittee on April 11 that he had received more than $1 million inpolitical donations from Recruit between 1985 and 1987.   Recruit, an information services company, is suspected of usingpolitical donations and other financial transactions to gain favorsfrom politicians and bureaucrats.   Although pressure on Takeshita to step down to appease publicand opposition criticism over the scandal has grown in the pastweek, a lack of strong candidates untainted by the scandal makesTakeshita's resignation problematic.   Virtually none of the most influential Liberal Democraticleaders could take over from Takeshita, says Takeshi Sasaki,political science professor at Tokyo University.   ``There is a leadership vacuum. There's literally nobodypowerful who has not been tainted by the scandal,'' said Robert M.Orr, professor of political science at Temple University in Tokyo.   The opposition is demanding that Takeshita resign and thatformer Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone testify in Parliament onhis own role in the Recruit affair.   A survey by the nationwide newspaper Mainichi Shimbun releasedFriday showed that 35.7 percent of Liberal Democratic Party membersin Japan's Parliament responding to the poll think Takeshita shouldresign.   Takeshita and Nakasone are among 17 politicians who reportedlybenefited from unlisted, cut-rate shares in a real-estatesubsidiary of Recruit. The shares, sold by the company to about 160influential politicians, public officials and businessmen, producedsubstantial profits for the recipients after over-the-countertrading began in October 1986.   Although the transactions were not illegal, they arousedsuspicions of bribery and influence-peddling. The result was anoutcry over fund-raising practices and the cozy relationshipbetween businessmen and politicians.</TEXT></DOC>
