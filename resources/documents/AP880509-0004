However, the military has vowed to let democracy unravel its owntangles, and most people said they were betting against militaryintervention.   Coup rumors have circulated since a week ago, when a disputeover control of the legislature prevented effective installation ofthe 60-member congress elected March 20.   President Jose Napoleon Duarte told journalists Thursday: ``Yes,we are in the midst of a crisis.'' But he added, ``I believe thearmed forces are absolutely convinced that this (a coup) would be afatal course for the country because every coup implies a divisionin the armed forces ... and in the middle of a war that would meana gigantic danger for national security.''   Leftist rebels are fighting U.S.-backed government forces in an8-year-old war that has claimed an estimated 65,000 lives.   Thirty deputies of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance,or Arena, took their seats May 1 and claim to constitute theNational Assembly.   The governing Christian Democrats, including Duarte, contendthat Arena lacks the majority necessary to install the congress andmake laws. The Christian Democrats were resoundingly defeated inthe legislative election, losing their parliamentary majority.   ``Right now, the country has no legislature,'' ChristianDemocratic leader Julio Adolfo Rey Prendes said at a newsconference May 2. He is the party's candidate in presidentialelections set for March.   The two main parties, along with the smaller NationalConciliation Party, spent the end of last week trying to negotiatean end to the impasse, but they failed. Positions appeared to havehardened.   The Christian Democrats and the Conciliation Party, who claim 30deputies between them, have formed an informal alliance to blockArena's control of the legislature.   One of the Christian Democrats' 23 deputies is claimed by Arena,which charges the seat was stolen through electoral fraud. Thatdispute is before the Supreme Court, but the Christian Democrats donot recognize its jurisdiction in the matter.   Government, opposition and military representatives have saidthe governmental crisis could deepen if the court rules for Arena,granting it a 31st seat and an outright majority.   Arena says the Assembly has 59 members meanwhile and that italready has a majority with 30 votes.   The Christian Democrats, in a parallel session, have seated thedisputed deputy in defiance of the court.   Meanwhile, the military has watched warily from the sidelines.Col. Mauricio Vargas, chief of operations of the joint chiefs ofstaff, said military intervention would do much more harm than good.   ``Nationally, it would be the rupture of the democraticprocess,'' he said. ``Internationally, it would mean isolation thatwould bring major repercussions. And to break the democratic systemwould be to provide justification for the guerrillas' position thatwe don't want democracy in this country.''   El Salvador receives more U.S. aid than any country in theWestern Hemisphere. Last year's economic and military assistancewas about $620 million.   President Reagan has repeatedly held up El Salvador as anexample of Central American democracy. Military interventionpresumably would bring strong U.S. bipartisan reaction and possiblya drastic cut in aid.   Though a coup appears unlikely, a top government source close tothe president said the military is exerting strong pressure onpoliticians to resolve the impasse. The source, who spoke oncondition of anonymity, said the armed forces had ``imposed adeadline'' but declined to give details.   Gen. Adolfo Blandon, head of the joint chiefs of staff, saidlast week: ``This (dispute) confuses things and is not beneficialto the democratic process. It is irresponsible behavior on the partof the deputies in whom the people deposited their trust.''   Ricardo Alvarenga, named by Arena as the new president of theAssembly, agreed that damage had already been done: ``This messleads the people to the conclusion, which is logical but notnecessarily correct, that the guerrillas are right when they sayour democracy does not work and is not the way to resolve ourproblems.''</TEXT></DOC>
