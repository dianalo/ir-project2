The House subcommittee on Environment, Energy and Natural Resources cited the case as an example of why the Energy Department needs to improve its reinvestigation of personnel who already hold security clearances. The report said the agency has failed to perform timely reinvestigations and lacks resources to investigate a list of employees and contractors that has expanded 18-fold since 1985.    The GAO report didn't identify the technician, saying only that he worked at an unspecified location. He hasn't been charged with any crime. In addition to the allegations that he sold uranium and secrets to the Palestinian Liberation Organization, the technician allegedly committed other crimes including drug peddling, rape and arson.    The technician, who received a security clearance in 1974, was reinvestigated by the Energy Department after a sheriff said he was arrested for carrying a weapon and having an expired license plate.    According to the Associated Press, an Energy Department official said that no sale of uranium to the PLO took place, and that reports of one &quot;appeared to be part of a scam of some kind that the U.S. attorney declined to prosecute.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
