The fine, following an inquiry by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration, was assessed on the closely held Navy contractor for allegedly exposing workers at its shipyard to asbestos-laden dust, radiation and raw sewage in work areas.    Conceding that the company's safety program &quot;has not been perfect,&quot; William E. Haggett, Bath chairman and chief executive officer, said OSHA &quot;exaggerated and sensationalized&quot; its findings. </TEXT></DOC>
