However, because this equipmentis still necessary for the production of critical integrated circuits,the notice reported a Presidential override of the foreign availabilityfinding and requested public comments on the economic impact of continuedcontrol. A Presidential override requires the Department of Commerce to retain therequirement for a validated export license while the President negotiateswith the government(s) of the identified source(s) for the eliminationof the foreign availability. The President overrode the foreign availabilityfinding on June 24, 1987 and the United States initiated negotiations toeliminate the foreign availability. The Department had 18 months to conclude negotiations to eliminate foreignavailability. As a result of the negotiations, foreign availability waseliminated completely for a five-month period; hence, the foreign availabilitycontrols have been maintained up to the time of this regulatory action.As of June 1, 1989, the United States Government has temporarily eliminatedthe foreign availability of magnetically enhanced sputtering equipmentspecially designed for the manufacture of semiconductors. The CommerceDepartment will continue to require a validated license for such equipmentduring the period for which foreign availability has been eliminated. However, other magnetically enhanced sputtering equipment that are forgeneral purpose applications and are not specially designed for manufacturingsemiconductors (e.g., bell jar types without vacuum load locks_designedto normally process one wafer at a time_in which the main chamber is openedeach time a wafer is manually loaded into and removed from the system,and batch types without vacuum load locks with hinged openings that provideaccess to the main chamber when wafers or other substrates are manuallyloaded into and removed from the system) will, effective June 1, 1989,no longer require a license to Country Groups T and V, except the People'sRepublic of China and Afghanistan. The U.S. Government will refer thisfinding to COCOM for a four-month consideration of possible removal ofnational security controls for exports to all destinations. A validatedlicense will continue to be required for foreign policy reasons for exportsto Country Groups S and Z.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements and Invitation to Comment </ITAG>1. This rule complies with Executive Order 12291 and Executive Order 12661.2. This rule mentions collections of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The Office of Management and Budget has approved thesecollections under control numbers 0694-0004 and 0694-0005. The net effectof this rule will be to reduce the number of export license applicationssubmitted for this equipment. This rule should reduce the paperwork burdenon the public. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of the Federalism Assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553), including those requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking,an opportunity for public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section13(b) of the EAA does not require that this rule be published in proposedform because this rule does not impose a new control. Further, no otherlaw requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity forpublic comment be given for this rule. However, because of the importance of the issues raised by these regulations,this rule is issued in interim form and comments will be considered inthe development of final regulations. Publishing this rule in proposedform would impair BXA's ability to issue effective and timely controls.Consistent with section 13(b) of the EAA, an opportunity for public commentis provided for this rule. The period for submission of comments will close July 6, 1989. The Departmentwill consider all comments received before the close of the comment periodin developing final regulations. Comments received after the end of thecomment period will be considered if possible, but their considerationcannot be assured. Accordingly, the Department encourages interested personswho wish to comment to do so at the earliest possible time to permit thefullest consideration of their views. The Department will not accept public comments accompanied by a requestthat part or all of the material be treated confidentially because of itsbusiness proprietary nature or for any other reason. The Department willreturn such comments and materials to the person submitting the commentsand will not consider them in the development of final regulations. All public comments on these regulations will be a matter of public recordand will be available for public inspection and copying. In the interestof accuracy and completeness, the Department requires comments in writtenform. Oral comments must be followed by written memoranda, which will alsobe a matter of public record and will be available for public review andcopying. Communications from agencies of the United States Government orforeign governments will not be made available for public inspection. The public record concerning these regulations will be maintained in theBureau of Export Administration Freedom of Information Records InspectionFacility, Room 4886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and PennsylvaniaAvenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230. Records in this facility, includingwritten public comments and memoranda summarizing the substance of oralcommunications, may be inspected and copied in accordance with regulationspublished in Part 4 to Title 15 of the <T3>Code of Federal Regulations. </T3>Information about the inspectionand copying of records may be obtained from Margaret Cornejo, Bureau ofExport Administration Freedom of Information Officer, at the above addressor by calling (202) 377-2593. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 799 </ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.
