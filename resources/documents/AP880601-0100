A spokesman for the army said the report was being checked.   New figures released by Israeli officials, meanwhile, indicatethe casualty toll in the uprising in the Israeli-occupiesterritories is higher than previously believed.   The army said Tuesday that 207 Palestinians had been killed,including 157 by gunfire from Israeli soldiers. The United Nationssays 199 Arabs have been killed, 11 of them from tear gas.   A left-wing legislator quoted a confidential document as saying5,133 Arabs have been injured since the uprising began Dec. 8.   In Washington, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakleycalled the tear gas report ``a matter of concern to us.''   ``We have repeatedly urged the government of Israel to usenon-lethal means to control violent demonstrations,'' she said.   Bill Lee, spokesman for the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, saidmost of the tear gas casualties were a result of the crowd controlgas being fired into closed rooms such as shelters, clinics andhomes, by troops dispersing demonstrators.   He said 1,285 Palestinians from refugee camps in the West Bankand Gaza Strip were treated in hospitals for breathing problemscaused by the tear gas.   ``The gas is not normally lethal when used according toprescribed directions, but it can be when fired into enclosedspaces,'' Lee said.   The 11 fatalities were reported through the end of April bydoctors who work in clinics in U.N. administered refugee camps, Leesaid. He said most of those killed were either infants, one asyoung as seven days, or people over 65.   Also among the victims was a 35-year-old woman in Gaza who diedalong with her unborn child after going into labor prematurely as aresult of inhaling tear gas, Lee said.   Palestinian hospital officials have repeatedly claimed thatIsraeli soldiers were using a new, more toxic gas on demonstrators.Israeli army officials denied it.   Lee said the gas used by Israel apparently causes muscle spasmswhich can trigger early labor or miscarriage, and that dozens ofsuch cases have been reported in the occupied territories.   Dr. John Hiddlestone, director of health affairs for the U.N.agency that aids Palestinians, said in Vienna on April 14 aftervisiting the occupied territories that the Israelis were using agas against Palestinians that causes abdominal pain, miscarriageand muscular weakness.   ``I am a physician and people are having symptoms other thannormal tear gas symptoms,'' he said.   Oakley, the U.S. spokeswoman, said the gas sold to Israel iscommonly used by U.S. police and the military. She said U.S. firmshad obtained government export licenses to sell the gas.   The army's death toll of 207 Palestinians was not explained andbrought the toll beyond the 199 counted by the United Nations. Thearmy said it was still investigating how 50 of the 207 died.   U.N. statistics indicate 167 Palestinians have been fatally shotby Israeli troops during the uprising and that 11 were killed byJewish settlers. Lee said the rest died from tear gas, beatings andother means.   The left-wing member of Parliament, Dedi Zucker, quoted a topdefense official as saying military ``harassment and maltreatment''of Palestinians was the chief reason that unrest continues in theoccupied lands.   Zucker of the liberal Citizens Rights Movement said theofficial, whom he refused to identify, spoke during a meeting withseveral legislators.   Zucker also quoted a confidential government document as saying5,133 Palestinians have been injured in the uprising.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin told a closed-door meeting oflegislators that the ``Intifadeh (uprising) has only cooled off onthe surface while underneath the goals are glowing as hot asbefore,'' the Jerusalem Post daily reported today.   Rabin who held two meetings in the past week with pro-Jordanianmoderate Palestinians, said Tuesday he would continue such talks``even with people who hold extreme views.''   He told Israel radio he decided to arrange the talks because hewas convinced the Palestinians now realized that ``with stones andfirebombs they can achieve nothing.''</TEXT></DOC>
