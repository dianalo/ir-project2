The negotiations will resume Monday afternoon.   Officials from the rival factions met at mid-morning followingfour hours of talks Thursday that left them looking exhausted anddisappointed that their efforts apparently had made little headway.   Spokesmen for both sides said the principal sticking point wasthe refusal by the Contras to agree to a Sandinista demand for thewithdrawal of rebel forces inside Nicaragua to base camps inHonduras.   The Sandinistas are linking their consent to a cease-fire to arebel withdrawal while the Contras are insisting on maintainingtheir present positions once a truce goes into effect.   One positive sign after the talks recessed was the absence ofkind of strident criticism of each other's position thatcharacterized their public comments 24 hours earlier.   Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, an official ``witness'' to thediscussions, left the talks Wednesday night to keep an appointmentelsewhere. He said he rejoined the negotiations Thursday night onorders from the Holy See.   After his departure Wednesday, the atmosphere for thediscussions deteriorated markedly.   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros told reporters he had noted a``hardening'' of the government's position on the cease fire.   The chief rebel negotiator, Col. Enrique Bermudez, said theSandinistas showed no interest in agreeing to a cease fire as afirst step in a confidence building process.   His Sandinista counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Victor HugoTinoco, said that for a ``real and effective cease-fire to takeplace, the Contras should go back to their camps in Honduras.''   There are an estimated 5,000 rebels inside Nicaraguan territory.   Tinoco seemed mystified about the Contra refusal to return toHonduras, noting that U.S.-supplied food and shelter is availableto them there.   Beyond that, he said, the Contras could take their arms withthem back to Honduras and they would reserve the option to returnwith their arms to Nicaragua if the peace process falters.   The talks are being mediated by officials from the UnitedNations and the Organization of American States. One official saidafter the 10 p.m. recess that the negotiations were ``inchingalong.''   Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega suspended the cease-fire 17days ago, citing what he said were repeated terrorist activities bythe Contra forces.   Reviving the truce is considered an important goal becausenational elections are set for Nicaragua on Feb. 25.</TEXT></DOC>
