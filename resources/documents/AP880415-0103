The army is a splinter faction of the leftist General Federationof Japanese Students, which claimed support from 850,000 of the 1.3million college students in Japan in the 1960s.   The Red Army apparently has not been involved in many attacksrecently, although Japanese police went on alert last November whenOsamu Maruoka, 37, a long-sought army leader, was arrested in Tokyoand found to have a one-way ticket to Seoul.   Police theorized he had planned to disrupte South Korea'spresidential elections in December.   The Red Army was believed never to have grown beyond 300members. Police action and internal feuding, climaxing with thekilling of 14 members at a mountain hideout in 1971, sapped itsstrength.   The group advocates ``simultaneous world revolution'' and isbelieved to have members allied with pro-Palestinian groups inLebanon.   In Naples, Italy, police said Friday that a member of the groupwas the prime suspect in a car bombing Thursday outside a U.S.military club that killed an American servicewoman and fourItalians. Seventeen people were injured.   Investigators said they were searching for Junzo Okudaira, 39,who also is suspected in rocket and bomb attacks on the U.S. andBritish embassies in Rome last June.   In New Jersey, authorities Tuesday arrested a Japanese man afterhe was found with three bombs in his car. Yu Kikumura, 35, is beingheld on federal charges of possessing a fraudulent visa andillegally possessing unregistered firearms, the explosives.   The Kyodo news service reported that Kikumura was believed tohave established links to the Red Army in 1974 in Greece.   The Red Army gained notoriety from a series of terrorist attacksin the 1970s, including one at Tel Aviv's Lod Airport in 1972 inwhich 28 people were killed. The army was also held responsible forthe hijacking of a Japan Airlines flight in 1977 shortly after itleft India.   Gunmen diverted the flight to Bangladesh. Once in Dhaka, theterrorists demanded the release of six prisoners, includingOkudaira, from Japanese jails.   They fled to Algeria after Japan released the prisoners and $6million in ransom in exchange for the plane passengers.</TEXT></DOC>
