Early conceptual observations awakened the scientificcommunity to the potentials of cancer chemotherapy. There are now morethan 50 agents that are active in causing regression of clinical cancer.Chemotherapy's major conceptual contributions are two-fold. First, thereis now proof that patients with overt metastatic disease can be cured,and second, to provide a strategy for control of occult metastases. Inman, chemotherapy has resulted in normal life expectancy for some patientswho have several types of metastatic cancers, including choriocarcinoma,Burkitt's lymphomas, Wilm's tumor, acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkinsdisease, diffuse histiocytic lymphoma and others. Anticancer chemotherapyin Veterinary medicine has evolved from the use of single agents, whichproduce only limited remissions, to the concept of combination chemotherapy.Three basic principles underline the design of combination chemotherapyprotocols; the fraction of tumor cell killed by one drug is independentof the fraction killed by another drug; drugs with different mechanismsof action should be chosen so that the antitumor effects will be additive;and since different classes of drugs have different toxicities the toxiceffects will not be additive.</TEXT></DOC>
