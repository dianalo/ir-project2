The dollar's rally was the mirror image of a debacle in the bondmarket. The selling binge in bonds drove interest yields higher andmade the dollar-denominated securities more attractive to globalinvestors.   Gold prices fell in U.S. trading after finishing higher overseas.   The dollar remained well below the peaks reached in June inspite of its one-day surge, which amounted to 1.9 percent againstthe West German mark, British pound and Japanese yen and an even 2percent vs. the Swiss franc.   The Labor Department triggered the rally by announcing thatnonfarm payrolls rose by 169,000 in July.   Although the figure was consistent with economists' predictions,many traders had been betting that payroll growth would be muchsmaller. Also, the department revised upward the figure for Junejob growth.   The job statistics renewed fears of inflation, which hurts thevalue of interest-paying securities. As a result bond prices felland their yields shot up.   The higher yields on bonds and short-term securities attractedmoney into dollars, said Marc Cohen, a vice president at RepublicNational Bank of New York.   Also helping the dollar was heightened tension in the MiddleEast, Cohen said. The dollar widely is seen as a safe haven frompolitical turmoil.
