The bank data processing concern previously had said it expected to post profit for the quarter. It didn't specify the size of the expected loss or say what effect the merger proposal costs would have on full-year results.    In the 1985 fourth quarter, First Data had net income of $740,352, or 21 cents a share, on revenue of $8 million. For all of 1985, it earned $5.9 million, or $1.10 a share, on revenue of $36.2 million.    First Data in May received an unsolicited bid of $25.2 million, or $7 a share, from First Financial Management Corp., Atlanta. It rejected the bid in June. In October, it reached a definitive agreement with a management-led investment team to take the company private in a leveraged buyout valued at about $36.5 million. In a leveraged buyout, a company is taken private in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Debt ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sales of assets. </TEXT></DOC>
