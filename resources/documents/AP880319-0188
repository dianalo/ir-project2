For the first time in quitea while, you can almost bank on interest rates.   ``This has been one of the quietest periods I've ever seen,''Elliott Platt, an economist at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; JenretteSecurities Inc., said in describing recent trading for bonds, notesand other debt-related products.   ``If there was a word that could be milder than calm that wouldbe appropriate,'' added F. Ward McCarthy, chief financial economistfor Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.   In the Treasury market, trading has slowed substantially.According to the Federal Reserve, the average daily dealertransaction was around $90 billion in the week ending March 9, atleast $10 billion below the norm.   Some economists say the flatness in the credit markets, whichset the trend for consumer and business rates, can be attributed toconflicting economic signals. Others say the markets are justtaking a break after starting the year on a somewhat volatile note.   Whatever the reasons, most predict that interest rates willremain fairly stable, at least through the spring.   ``From the consumer standpoint I think the fact that we've hadsome stability has been reassuring. Volatility in recent years hastaken its toll on consumer confidence,'' said McCarthy, whodescribed as comfortable the current level of interest rates.   The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, the most-watched debtsecurity, has remained in a fairly narrow range since late January,fluctuating around 8.5 percent _ the same level as the currentprime lending rate.   Mortgage rates have inched their way downward so far this yearbut have remained fairly level in recent weeks, too.   The average rate charged by commercial lenders on a fixed-rate,30-year mortgage has been just below 10 percent since earlyFebruary, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Therate on adjustable mortgages has hovered around 7.5 percent inrecent weeks, Freddie Mac said.   Compared to a year ago, there isn't too much change. However,rates are at least two percentage points lower now than they werearound the time when the stock market crashed last October.   After the market plunged, the Fed eased its credit policies,allowing interest rates to fall, to prevent the economy fromfalling into a recession. Lately, some signs of economic growthhave surfaced, mingled with reports to the contrary.   In light of the mixed signals, analysts say the Fed hasindicated it will maintain a fairly stable policy through thespring.   ``The government has intimated it was more concerned about highinflation than a recession,'' said Elizabeth G. Reiners, assistantdirector of money market reserach for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.``It looks like inflation is at a comfortable level.   ``If you keep policy stable, you're looking at stable rates.''   Among the benefactors of stable rates have been homebuyers andthose looking to refinance loans or borrow for other big purchases.   Knowing that rates aren't likely to swing wildly ``means thatpeople have more freedom of choice about when to do their homebuying and moving,'' said Carol A. Stone, a senior economist atNomura Securities Inc.   Corporations and municipalities looking to sell their bonds andnotes also have felt less pressured.   ``If they're considering a deal it gives them a little moreleeway ... because the market isn't moving wildly,'' said Mrs.Reiners.   But the big losers, Mrs. Reiners said, have been bond traders,who make their money on the ups and downs of the market andinvestors looking for high-yielding securities.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Weekend Editions March 19-20</NOTE></DOC>
