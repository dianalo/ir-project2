To provide a ready source of this hybrid molecule and to allowtailoring of the active moieties for optimal activity, the authors haveengineered a recombinant version of the 59D8-t-PA conjugate. The rearranged59D8 heavy chain gene was cloned and combined in the expression vectorpSV2gpt with sequence coding for a portion of the {gamma}2b constantregion and the catalytic {beta} chain of t-PA. This construct was transfectedinto heavy chain loss variant cells derived form the 59D8 hybridoma.Recombinant protein was purified by affinity chromatography and analyzedwith electrophoretic transfer blots and radioimmunoassay. These revealeda 65-kDa heavy chain-t-PA fusion protein that is secreted in associationwith the 59D8 light chain in the form of a 170-kDa disulfide-linked dimer.Chromogenic substrate assays showed the fusion protein to have 70% ofthe peptidolytic activity of native t-PA and to activate plasminogenas efficiently as t-PA. IN a competitive binding assay, reconstitutedantibody was shown to have a binding profile similar to that of native59D8. Thus, by recombinant techniques, they have produced a hybrid proteincapable of high affinity fibrin binding and plasminogen activation.</TEXT></DOC>
