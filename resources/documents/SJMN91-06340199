In the audience, two of his sons-in-lawsat grim-faced, one with his head in his hands. Keating's secretary held backtears, once biting one of her knuckles to hold herself in check.;   A group ofbondholders, though, held hands tightly, smiled broadly and barely suppressedcheers each time the court clerk read a guilty verdict.;   Keating faces amaximum of 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine at his sentencing, which isscheduled for Feb. 7. He remained free after the verdict on $100,000 bail,after Judge Lance A. Ito rejected the prosecution's effort to raise bail to $1million.;    Keating expresses confidence;   &quot;I firmly believe in myself, myfamily, my friends and I very much believe in my counsel,&quot; Keating saidoutside court. &quot;I look forward to the future unafraid, sure that justice willbe done.&quot;;   Stephen Neal, his attorney, said he would ask Ito to overturn theverdicts and, failing that, appeal the decision.;   The charges againstKeating were based on 18 separate instances in which Lincoln depositors boughtAmerican Continental junk bonds from 1986 to 1989.;   On the one count thatKeating was acquitted of, prosecutors acknowledged after the verdict thatthere had been some evidence at the trial that the buyer of the bonds knewmore about their risks than the 17 other purchasers.;   Prosecutors, who facedan uphill battle with a much-criticized case and adverse rulings, wereelated.;    Legal troubles ahead;   &quot;We were able to weave a web ofcircumstantial evidence tightly enough&quot; to prove Keating's culpability, saidWilliam Hodgman, the lead deputy Los Angeles County district attorney whoprosecuted the case.;   The verdict does not end the threat of furthercriminal prosecution against the former Arizona businessman. A long-awaitedfederal grand jury indictment is expected soon. Keating was told more than ayear ago that he was a target defendant in that investigation.;   He alsofaces much civil litigation involving many of nearly 20,000 small investorswho purchased about $250 million in bonds from Keating's American ContinentalCorp. The company sold many of the junk bonds through Lincoln branches.;   Theprosecution's case attempted to show that Keating withheld importantinformation from customers about the shaky financial condition of Lincoln andAmerican Continental.;   Five senators recruited;   The collapse of Lincolnbrought nationwide scrutiny to the nation's Sandamp;L crisis and the politics behindthe deregulation issue.;   Keating recruited five U.S. senators -- AlanCranston, D-Calif., John McCain, R-Ariz., Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., JohnGlenn, D-Ohio, and Donald Riegle, D-Mich. -- to lobby U.S. regulators on hisbehalf in 1987. Although regional regulators based in San Francisco firstwarned that Lincoln was in trouble that year, the Washington-based Sandamp;Lregulatory agency didn't approve its takeover for two more years.;   WilliamCrawford, who while he was state savings and loan commissioner tangled withKeating over Lincoln's finances, was happy with the conviction. &quot;Justice isserved,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm glad to see that the guy finally got his comeuppance.&quot;;  (Last paragraph ran in early editions only); Only Cranston rebuked;  Cranston was recently publicly criticized by the Senate Ethics Committee forhis actions on behalf of Keating. McCain, who was a witness for theprosecution in the trial, and the three other senators were not disciplined bythe committee.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Wire Services  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Los Angeles  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911205  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  674  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, December 5, 199100340199,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
