 The X protocol (often simply called &quot;X&quot;) offersgraphics and windowing capabilities as well as a standard,machine-independent interface for building applications.andM;X terminals offer several advantages over workstations: First and foremost,they don't require individual users to act as system administrators.andP;  BecauseX terminals are linked to centralized host systems, users don't need toperform software updates or other disk and network management chores.andM;Another advantage is found in cost per unit: It is far cheaper to buy onehost and run a dozen X terminals off it than to buy 12 workstations.andM;In this, DR Labs' first evaluation of X terminals, we looked at six products:Graphon's OptimaX 200, the Jupiter Systems Model 310, the NCD19 from NetworkComputing Devices (NCD), the Towerview XL19 from NCR, Tektronix's XN10 andthe X-19 Turbo from Visual Technology.andP;  Covering a wide range of prices andcapabilities, there terminals are a representative sampling of the productsavailable in the X market today.andM;X IN GENERALandM;X is a windowing system designed to allow  multiple windows--each running adifferent application--to be open simultaneously.andP;  It works with eithermonochrome or color bit-mapped displays and can be run either locally--suchas when it runs on a workstation--or over some kind of network.andP;  X terminalsusually communicate with a host over Ethernet, although they can alsocommunicate over fiber-optic or RS-232-C connections.andM;X is designed to be hardware-independent and maintains its own programlibraries on the host.andP;  X terminals therefore require server software tocommunicate over the network with the host and to run X applications.andP;  Theserver, which is provided by each terminal's vendor, runs on the terminalitself in most implementations of X, scheduling windows and translating userrequests and host instructions.andP;  In Graphon's implementation of X, the serverruns on the host.andM;The server is responsible not only for terminal performance but also for thefeel of the terminal and the terminal's compatibility with X applications andimplentations.andP;  A bug-ridden server can be very serious in terms of lostperformance and the inability to run some applications, where as good serverimplementation can add considerably zipo to the hardware's performance.andM;A terminal-based server resides in either ROM or RAM.andP;  Many companies,including Visual and NCR, offer both RAM- and ROM-based servers.andP;  Since RAMis volatile (data is lost when the power goes off), a server that runs fromRAM must be loaded into the terminal each time that the machine is poweredup.andP;  The server can be loaded either from a host or from ROM.andM;In contrast, a ROM-based terminal doesn't require that the vendor supply itsserver software separately, and it takes less time to load a server from ROM.andM;The advantage of RAM-based server software is the potential for higherperformance.andP;  However, when the server software is in RAM, such terminalshave less room to store fonts and images.andM;Frequently, to save RAM, some fonts are stored in ROM, eliminating the needto download these fonts from a host.andP;  In addition, because different Xterminals on the network may require different font formats, it may not bepractical to store all of the necessary fonts on the host.andM;In the world of X, fonts start life as text files, called Bit DistributableFormat (BDF) files.andP;  They are then converted to Server Natural Format (SNF)fonts using the bdftosnf converter from the MIT X Consortium.andM;If there were only one SNF, things would be simple.andP;  However, certain serversfunction more efficently with 8-bit fonts, some with 16-bit or 32-bit.andP;  Thebdftosnf converter includes options to support the creation of all of these.andO;However, one server's fonts aren't necessarily compatible with another's.andM;The X Consortium distributes 8-bit and 16-bit SNF fonts with version X 11Release 3 of the X protocol.andP;  However, some server designers--notablyDEC--use a different font format.andM;DECwindows is DEC's version of X.andP;  Strictly speaking, it is a superset of Xto which DEC has given some additional features, including some fonts in itsown DECwindows Format (DWF).andP;  These fonts aren't compatible with any of the Xservers on the market except Graphon's.andP;  However, this incompatibility isn'tan issue for any of the products we evaluated except NCR's, because allexcept NCR distribute tapes with look-alike fonts for use with DECwindows.andM;When asked to call an incompatible DECwindows font, the servers simplysubstitute the font they can read.andP;  There are also some X terminals, likeVisual's, which are designed to read two or three different font formats.andM;TALENT ROUNDUPandM;Most of the X terminals that we evaluated include a terminal emulator toestablish host connections.andP;  The notable exception is Jupiter Systems' 310,which relies on a somewhat cumbersome method of starting X sessions fromanother terminal, such as a VT320.andM;Al l the terminals evaluated except Jupiter Systems' and Graphon's had Telnetcapabilities.andP;  Graphon's OptimaX 200 runs on an RS-232-C cable, linking up tothe network via Local Area Transport (LAT) or a direct connection.andP;  NCD isthe only vendor in the group that includes DECnet capabilities based onThursby Software Systems' TSSnet.andP;  Visual Technology also plans to provideDECnet support soon.andM;All of the terminals in our test group also include some method, usuallyeither the Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) or the Network File System(NFS), for accessing X fonts.andP;  Depending on which protocol a particular siteuses, this issue may affect the choice of an X terminal.andM;VMS hosts cannot be accessed directly from any of these terminals except theNCD's (via its DECnet support) and Graphon's (via its RS-232-C connection),although they can be accessed via Telnet using DEC's VMS/Ultrix Connection ora VMS-to-TCP/IP layered software product.andM;The Tektronix XN10 and the Jupiter Model 310 both offer color monitors; theNCD19, Graphon OptimaX 200, Visual's X-19 Turbo and the NCR XL19 havemonochrome monitors.andP;  For some users, especially users of CAD applications,the absence of color may be a problem.andM;RAP ON GRAPHONandM;Graphon's implementation of X is unique because the server is located on thehost, not built into the terminal.andP;  It compresses and transmits bits over anRS-232-C serial cable instead of using Ethernet.andM;The OptimaX 200 is Graphon's high-end X terminal.andP;  Built around a 12MHzMotorola 68000 chip, the OptimaX has a lower-resolution monitor (800 by 920pixels) but provides greater performance than Graphon's other X terminals.andM;Connecting to the host using an RS-232-C cable rather than directly overEthernet allows Graphon to offer an affordable X terminal that can functionover modem lines and other asynchronous communications lines.andP;  But there aresome serious disadvantages to using RS-232-C.andM;First of all, Ethernet's throughput is 10 Mbits per second.andP;  Graphon'sterminals, running on RS-232-C, support a maximum speed of only 38,4000 bitsper second (bps).andM;We tested a 19,200-bps connection, which would be typical of a DECenvironment.andP;  However, even if performance were doubled to 38,400 bps, theOptimaX 200 would still be extremely sluggish compared with terminals usingEthernet.andM;The OptimaX 200 doesn't use the Serial Line Internet Protocol (SL/IP), aprotocol for serial line communication that essentially allows Telnet over anRS-232-C connection.andP;  Instead, it relies on its own proprietary serialprotocol to transmit packets to and from the terminal.andM;Because the server is on the host, the OptimaX uses host RAM, cutting down onthe amount of local RAM required.andP;  Any RAM added to the host computer iseffectively added t all the OptimaX terminals using it as a host.andP;  TheOptimaxX 200 requires only 128KB of local memory, which comes standard withthe terminal, although users can optionally purchase an additional 512KB ofRAM.andM;Use of host RAM has its disadvantages, because the terminal uses host memoryto perform many server functions, such as storing fonts.andP;  Running severalGraphon X terminals on the same host could quickly exhaust the host's memory.andM;Forcing the host to run the server in addition to other applications can alsodegrade overall host performance.andP;  The Optimax's 68000 microprocessorperforms primarily simple functions such as cursor tracking and localdrawing, leaving the bulk of the computation tasks to the host.andM;Graphon offers host software for the Sun Mic rosystems and Solbourne Computerline of workstations, DEC's VMS and Ultrix machines, and Hewlett-Packard's HP9000 Series 300.andP;  A Mips Computer Systems version is being developed.andM;The OptimaX delivers 800-by-600-pixel X windows images.andP;  (The terminal canproduce a virtual resolution of 920bit vertical if it is started using the-bm 800x920 switch.andP;  To see lines beyond the edge of the screen, users mustdrag the mouse to the edge of the screen and keep going).andP;  The refresh rateis 75Hz and is non-interlaced; that is, it draws the entire screen for eachscan.andM;Users accustomed to DEC LK201 keyboards may find that eht positions of somekeys on the OptimaX's keyboard will take some getting used to.andM;Of the terminals tested, only the OptimaX offers VT200 emulation.andP;  All exceptthe Jupiter Systems Model 310 offer VT100 emulation.andM;The OptimaX 200 model that we evaluated is priced at $1,815, including $1,395for the base unit, $125 for the mouse and $295 for the 512KB memory option.andM;JUMPING JUPITERandM;On the high end of both price and single-window performance is JupiterSystems' Model 310, a 19-inch, 1,280-by-1,024-pixel color X terminal built onthe 20MHz Motorola 68030 and 68882 chip set.andP;  However, the 310's refreshrate--60Hz--is below that of many of its competitors.andM;The 310 uses two internal VME buses, one for the Motorola processor board andone for Jupiter Systems' own proprietary graphics board.andP;  Jupiter also makesthe 314, whihc is identical to the 310 except that it has four VME buses, twoof which can be used for high-speed graphics data transfer.andM;The 310's greatest strength is its performance.andP;  It is really in the marketto compete with low-end workstations.andM;Jupiter's 310 has one severe drawback: no Telnet capabilities.andP;  To initiate asession and make use of an application--including the window manager--usersmust utilize a separate terminal.andP;  Jupiter has announced that Telnet supporwill be added in the spring.andM;There are also two problems in the 310's server software.andP;  In both thesingle- and multiple-window tests, the 310 was unable to perform the unmapkernel, which unmaps a window via its parent window.andP;  (For more informationon X11per, see &quot;Birth of a benchmark: DR Labs debuts the DXUP,&quot; above right.)andO;Jupiter Systems officials said they are aware of this problem.andM;The significane of this is that X applications using this kind of operationwill fail on the Model 310.andP;  It is difficult for terminal buyers to predictwhich applications use these calls because only a careful examination of theapplications' source code, or trial runs of those applications on theterminal, will show if there is a problem.andM;Another problem was encountered in the multiple-window test: the destroykernel, which destroys a window via its parent, caused the server to crash.andM;The 310's impressive processor power gave it a very smooth feel when we wereusing a single window.andP;  When using multiple windows, performance degradedseverely, mostly because of limitations in the server's scheduler, whichdecides when applications will be allowed to draw to the screen.andP;  Still, the310's multiple-window performance was comparable to that of the otherterminals we tested.andM;The 310 is available with 4MB or 8MB of memory, comes with three fontsresident in ROM and is priced at $11,950.andM;NCD LANDSCAPEandM;Network Computing Devices' NCD19 Network Display Station uses a Motorola68020 microprocessor that runs at a 15MHz clock speed.andP;  The NCD19 comesstandard with 2MB of memory but can be configured with as much as 8MB ofmemory.andP;  The 19-inch landscape display offers a sharp resolution of 1,280 by1,024 pixels and a 70Hz non-interlaced refresh rate.andM;The NCD19 has a thin-wire Ethernet link that allows connection to hostsystems via TCP/IP or NCDnet, a DECnet-compatible networking protocol basedon a version of Thursby Software Systems' TSSnet.andP;  the NCDnet software mustbe installed on the host system.andM;The NCD19's serial port lets users connec to TCP/IP-networked hosts via SL/IPor to &quot;NCDnetworked&quot; hosts via the Digital Data Communications Protocol(DDCMP).andP;  Although the terminal is primarily an X server, it also providesVT100 emulation.andM;The NCD19's server can be loaded from the host system or from PROM.andP;  Ineither case, the server is placed in the terminal's RAM.andP;  The NCD19 has eightinternal fonts of its own and can dowload additional fonts via.andP;  NFS or TFTPon TCP/IP networks.andP;  NCDnet is used to download fonts in DECnet environments.andM;Besides basic network mangement tools, the NCD19 also offers limited butuseful network monitoring tools in the setup menu.andP;  The Network StatisticsWindows, for instance, shed light on network activity, letting users monitortraffic.andP;  The Diagnostic Session Window lets u sers view output, such aserror and warning messages, sent to the NCD console.andP;  This window alsoprovides information about total and available memory.andM;The NCD19 terminal is priced at $3,750 with 2MB of memory, and $2,550 withthe standard 1MB of memory.andM;VIEW FROM NCR'S TOWERandM;One of the most intriguing X terminals we evaluated was NCR's Towerview XL19.andO;With a 19-inch monochrome monitor, resolution of 1,280 by 1,024 pixels ad a70Hz refresh rate, the Towerview's monitor has the same specifications asthose of the NCD19.andP;  NCR also offer the XL15, a 15-inch version with a1,024-by-800-pixel resolution and a 76Hz refresh rate.andM;Like the NCD19, the Towerview XL19 is built on the Motorola 68020microprocessor, but the NCR has a higher clock speed of 16.7MHz.andP;  DR Labs'XL19 evaluation unit came fully loaded with 4MB of RAM, but users can alsoconfigure the terminal with 1MB, 2MB or 3MB.andM;Of the X terminals we tested, the XL19 had some of the most interestingfeatures.andP;  First, it has a multiple Telnet capability, allowing users to openconnections to multiple hosts before starting X.andP;  More importantly, the XL19has local client capabilities.andP;  This means that the XL19 can run someapplications on the terminal itself, including the window manger,dramatically reducing network traffic and overhead.andM;The XL19 also has an interesting setup technique: Rather than menus orprompts, it uses icons to call forms that the user can fill in.andP;  When X isstarted, the icons--which appear in the lower right corner of thescreen--disappear beneath the window manager; however, in contrast to theother terminals we evaluated, the setup icons reappear if the window manageris stopped.andM;At present, the XL19 does not support SL/IP or DECwindows fonts.andP;  While NCRofficials say that the company plans to add SL/IP, support for DECwindowsfonts is not imminent.andP;  For most applications that isn't a problem:DECwindows-specific fonts are rather few now.andM;The XL19 stores eight fonts in ROM and downloads others with TFTP.andP;  (NCRplans to add NFS by the fourth quarter.)andP;  Downloaded fonts are cached in andout of RAM so that RAM is never filled by fonts when an application needsmemory.andM;Server software can come from ROM or can be downloaded from a host into RAM.andO;In our tests, the RAM implementation was significantly (10 percent) fasterthan the ROM version.andP;  The XL19 terminal that we tested is priced at $5,340.andM;COLOR TEKTRONIXandM;Next we turned to another color X terminal: the Tektronix XN10 X server.andP;  TheXN10 uses Texas Instruments' 34010 microprocessor for graphics processing andthe Intel 386sx for I/O processing.andP;  The standard screen is 16 inches, and a19-inch screen--which we evaluated--is also available.andP;  Both screens have a1,024-by-768-pixel resolution.andM;The server software for the XN10 is created by Advance Graphics Engineering,which markets its color server software to many companies.andP;  Unfortunately,the server in the XN10 that we evaluated proved to be extremely buggy andrather slow.andM;The XN10 was unable to perform four of our benchmark's kernels: ucreate,which creates an unmapped window such as a menu; map, which maps a window viaits parent; unmap, which unmaps a window via its parent; and destroy, whichdestroys a window via its parent.andP;  On the unmap kernel, the XN10 ran out ofmemory and crashed.andM;Of course, the significance of these failures to terminal buyers depends onwhether their planned applications use these calls.andM;Since the evaluation unit Tektronix provided to DR Labs had only 2MB of RAM,the problems we were experiencing may have been due to lack of physicalmemory.andP;  We expressed this concern to Tektronix, but were unable to procuremore memory from the vendor.andP;  The XN10 can be purchased with 2MB, 4MB, 6MBand 8MB of RAM.andM;The XN10 comes with more resident fonts--20--than any other terminal weevaluated.andP;  Additional fonts can be downloaded via TFTP or NFS.andM;One potential drawback of the XN10 is that it supports only standard(thick-wire) Ethernet.andM;Equipped with a 19-inch monitor and 2MB of RAM, the XN10 is priced at $5,995.andO;The price for the 16-inch monitor version is $4,995.andM;VISUAL IMAGESandM;Visual Technology's X-19 Turbo comes with a 19-inch monochrome monitor thathas a 1.280-by-1,024-pixel resolution and a 72Hz refresh rate, giving theX-19 Turbo the highest resolution and refresh rate combination of all theterminals we evaluated.andP;  The X-19 Turbo is built ona 20MHz Motorola 68020microprocessor and supports from 1MB to 8MB of RAM.andM;The X-19 Turbo supports MIT/Sun SNF format fonts and can interpret twoadditional formats.andP;  The advantage of this feature is that if an X-19 Turbois added to a site that  uses other X terminals, the Turbo will probably beable to read those terminals' fonts.andP;  This will save disk space, becauseVisual's fonts won't need to be installed.andM;Visual's font tape comes with DECwindows look-alike fonts.andP;  Additionally, 10fonts are provided in ROM, and it is possible to download fonts via TFTP andNFS.andP;  Visual also has its own font-downloading software, consisting of afont-server &quot;daemon&quot; with which the X Display Station communicates.andP;  Systemsthat have neither TFTP nor NFS may find this downloading method particularlyuseful.andM;Two other font services included with the X Display Station, font paging andcaching, keep terminla RAM from becoming cluttered with useless fontinformation.andM;Like the NCD19, the X-19 Turbo has extensive network management tools,including one to monitor network traffic.andP;  Warning messages are kept in ahidden window that can be accessed in one keystroke.andM;One of the product's unique features is an extension to the MIT X DisplayManager (XDM) that provides automatic log-in capabilities.andP;  An on-line helpfeature--unique among the products we tested--makes Visual's extensive setupmenu easy to master.andM;Visual makes both a ROM- and RAM-based server.andP;  We evaluated the ROM-basedmodel.andM;The X-19 Turbo with 4MB of RAM, and all firmware in ROM is priced at $4,795.andM;Performance of our evaluation units varied widely.andM;The aggregate geometric means that we recorded in our single- andmultiple-window tests are general indicators of X terminal performance (Fig.andO;1).andP;  For general-purpose window use--moving windows, typing text in amultiple-window environment, pulling down a menu--we found that a differenceof 0.01 DXUPs (DECstation 3100 X units of processing) produced a noticeablechange in performance.andP;  In general, a difference of 0.02 DXUPs wassignificant.andM;BENCHMARK RESULTSandM;The average performance for the X terminals we tested was 0.22 DXUPs in thesingle-window tests and 0.13 DXUPs in the multiple-window tests (Fig.andP;  2).andO;By contrast, all of the workstations DR Labs has tested achieved more than0.80 DXUPs on the single-window tests.andM;The slowest performer on the single-window test was the Graphon OptimaX 200,which earned a DXUP rating of 0.05.andP;  We couldn't perform the multiple-windowtest on this terminal because Graphon doesn't yet have software to run onMips computers.andM;The OptimaX 200 performed well in tests of X-specific applications such asgetting atom names and properties and circulating unmapped windows.andP;  Its lowDXUP rating implies that the OptimaxX should not be considered in situationsdemanding high X performance--for example, a high graphics-contentapplication such as CAD.andP;  Our work with the OptimaX server software uncoveredno bugs.andM;Jupiter Systems' Model 310 topped the single-window performance list at 0.32DXUPs.andP;  In our multiple-window tests, however, its performance dropped to0.14 DXUPs, representing a 58 percent performance degradation.andM;The 310 performed well on several window tests, including the drawing ofrectangles, tiled rectangles, dashed segments and dashed lines, circles andfilled circles, and completing the copyarea operation.andP;  The 310 performedwell when drawing dashed lines and circles.andP;  In the single- andmultiple-window tests, the Model 310 could not unmap a window via its parent,and in the multiple-window test, it also could not destroy a window via itsparent.andM;The NCD19's performance placed it slightly below most of its competitors at0.26 DXUPs in the single-window tests and 0.14 DXUPs in the multiple-windowtests--a 50 percent performance degradation.andM;The NCD19 performed well in the following single-window tests: drawing tiledrectangles, dashed segments, dashed lines, circles and ellipses.andP;  (On thelast test, the NCD19 achieved an astounding 14.00 DXUPs).andP;  On themultiple-window benchmarks, the NCD19 performed well on only two tests:drawing circles and ellipses.andP;  Again, the performance when drawing ellipseswas outstanding.andM;We uncovered a problem in the NCD19's server software in our multiple-windowtests: Like many other servers, NCD19's was unable to unmap a window via itsparent.andM;The XL19 from NCR (using a RAM-based server) had the best overall performanceof the X terminals we evaluated, achieving 0.27 DXUPs on the single-windowtest and 0.19 DXUPs on the multiple-window benchmark.andP;  That translates to aperformance degradation of only 33 percent--the lowest degradation werecorded.andM;The XL19 performed well in the single-window tests when drawing tiledrectangles, dashed segments, circles and ellipses.andP;  It also performed wellwhen scrolling images and completing the copyplane operation.andO;Multiple-window tests barely slowed the terminal.andM;The XL19 could not unmap a window from its parent in the multiple-window testwhen using the RAM-based server.andM;Tektronix's XN10 achieved only 0.13 DXUPs on the single-window and 0.04 DXUPson the multiple-window tests, demonstrating a miserable performancedegradation of 70 percent.andP;  It places second-worst to Graphon insingle-window performance and worst in multiple-window performance.andP;  The XN10was barely half as fast as the DECstation 3100 when running any of ourbenchmark kernels.andM;Next to the NCR XL19, the Visual X-19 Turbo had the best overall performance,turning in 0.27 DXUPs--the same as XL19--on the single-window tests and 0.15DXUPs on the multiple-window tests: Performance degraded 47 percent.andP;  Wedidn't experience any problems with the Visual server.andM;The X-19 Turbo performed well on the single-window tests when drawing tiledsquares, opaque squares, tiled rectangles, dashed segments, dashed lines, andellipses; scrolling images; and completing the X putimage operation.andP;  In themultiple-window tests, it performed extremely well while drawing ellipses.andM;Our evaluations indicate that the NCR Towerview XL19 and Visual's X-19 Turbooffer the best overall performance, followed by the NCD19.andP;  These terminalsare priced at $5,340, $4,795 and $4,750, respectively.andM;The Jupiter 310's performance is good for single-window operations but isonly average for multiple-window operations.andP;  Its $11,950 price tag wouldmake its purchase hard to justify for general-purpose use.andM;Graphon's OptimaX 200 performs relatively slowly but isn't intended primarilyas a high-performance terminal and is priced at only $1,815.andM;The price/performance ratios of the machines shed a different light on theirtrue cost.andP;  We calculated their price per DXUP using the price of the modelswe tested and each model's single-window X11 perf performance.andP;  At $17,759per DXUP, the Visual X-19 has the best price/performance ratio of all themachines evaluated, followed by NCD's NCD19 at $18,269 per DXUP and the NCRXL19 at $19,778 per DXUP.andM;The Graphon OptimaX 200 comes in at a whopping $36,300 per DXUP, and theJupiter Model 310 is priced at $38,548 per DXUP.andP;  The Tektronix tops the listat $46,115 per DXUP.andM;By contrast, a DECstation 3100, configured with 16MB of memory and a harddisk, would be about $38,000 per DXUP and would deliver a full 1 DXUP, unlikeall the other terminals we evaluated.andM;Although none of the test terminals perform as well, overall, as ourDECstation 3100, they don't share that machine's hefty price tag.andM;When top graphics performance isn't a necessity, X terminals can often takethe place of low-end workstations.andP;  Unfortunately, the reverse is also true:Sites demanding outstanding graphics performance will require the pricierworkstations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
