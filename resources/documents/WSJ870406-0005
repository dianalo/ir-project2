For the year-earlier quarter, the maker of cables reported a loss of $318,000. Sales fell 29% to $9 million from $12.6 million.    BIW said its fourth-quarter figures were depressed by its establishment during the quarter of a $2.2 million reserve for &quot;possible excess and obsolete inventory.&quot; The company added that its sales fell because of a continuing downturn in the petroleum and other markets that it serves.    The company said that on March 24 it sold its Boston headquarters facility for $2.8 million, which resulted in a gain of $2.2 million in the first quarter. The company didn't elaborate, and BIW officials couldn't be reached for comment.    In the 1986 first quarter, BIW had a loss of $2 million, including a charge of $1.8 million for write-down of inventory, on sales of $12.2 million.    BIW said business of some of its operations recently improved. The backlog of its East Coast operations rose to $11.8 million in December from $6.4 million a year earlier, the company said. Backlogs of its British and Canadian operations also have recently risen, BIW said.    For 1986, the company reported a loss of $6.6 million, including a charge of $1.8 million for write-down of inventory, compared with net income of $49,000, or two cents a share, a year earlier. Sales fell 9% to $44.4 million from $48.7 million. </TEXT></DOC>
