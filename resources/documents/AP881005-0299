(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 3,500 members of the United AutoWorkers union walked off their jobs Wednesday at a Chrysler Corp.assembly plant when negotiators failed to meet a contract deadline.   ``We worked through the night trying to resolve the issues butwere unable to reach an agreement,'' Chrysler spokesman LloydNorthard said in Highland Park, Mich., following the 10 a.m. CDTwalkout. ``Our labor relations people are still there trying toreach an agreement.''   Northard declined to specify the issues keeping the two sidesapart. A national agreement between Chrysler and the UAW wasreached in May.   Chrysler's working agreements with 138 UAW locals expired atmidnight Sept. 14, but had been extended on day-to-day bases,Northard said. Although many local agreements have been reached,UAW Local 110 in Fenton notified the company last week it wasimposing Wednesday's deadline.   A strike authorization vote was taken several months ago byLocal 110. Its members gave 88 percent approval last week toextending the strike deadline beyond a Sept. 30 date that had beenset.   Local president George Burr said negotiations were ongoing.   ``We're prepared to go around the clock,'' Burr said. ``I'm notgoing to break (them) off if we're getting somewhere.''   Long-wheelbase minivans are assembled at the plant, where afive-week walkout to protest stalled contract talks was staged byUAW Local 110 members in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
