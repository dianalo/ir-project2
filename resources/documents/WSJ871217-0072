The company also said it would take a $50 million pretax charge against fourth-quarter earnings because of the &quot;enhanced severance program&quot; associated with the layoff, which will affect 7% to 10% of its employees, or about 1,575 to 2,250 people.    &quot;These changes are essential in order to improve our profitability in a very tough environment,&quot; C.J. Silas, Phillips's chairman and chief executive officer said in a statement. &quot;Oil, gas liquids and natural-gas prices are lower than expected as we enter the new year, and there seems to be little chance of significant improvement in the near future.&quot;    &quot;The indecisiveness of OPEC was factored into this,&quot; said a company spokesman. &quot;Certainly the fact that OPEC can't seem to get it together is an indication of what's going on in the price arena.&quot; OPEC agreed Monday to continue its $18-a-barrel official price, but analysts are skeptical about whether the oil producing companies that make up OPEC will honor the agreement.    Phillips also said it was indefinitely postponing a planned issue of $400 million of convertible subordinated debentures but said the cutbacks weren't related to the delayed offering. The company said in September that the issue was planned to refinance other debt.    Analysts generally applauded the move by the Bartlesville, Okla.-based company. &quot;I view this very constructively,&quot; said Eugune Nowak of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. &quot;It's always prudent to do these things beforehand, to protect the quality of operations and earnings. On an annual basis the impact of (the savings) could be very meaningful.&quot;    In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Phillips closed at $10.50, up 25 cents.    Though the cutbacks came only days after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries accord that the oil industry found disappointing, they also follow two years of restructuring at Phillips that was prompted by failed takeover attempts mounted by T. Boone Pickens Jr., the Texas oilman, and Carl C. Icahn, the New York investor, and continued when oil prices plunged. Since year-end 1984, Phillips has reduced its work force almost 25% to 22,500 and has sold $2 billion in assets to pay debt incurred fighting off Messrs. Pickens and Icahn.    &quot;I'm calling this 'cost-cutting part two,'&quot; said Mary Quinn, an analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    Phillips said it expects to achieve 70% of the $150 million to $200 million in savings by the end of 1988, and the balance by the end of 1989.    The company plans to merge its Exploration andamp; Production and Gas andamp; Gas Liquids units to &quot;reduce redundancies,&quot; the spokesman said, and to save on administrative costs. The eastern and western divisions of the Exploration andamp; Production unit, which are based in Houston and Denver, respectively, will be consolidated in Bartlesville.    Ms. Quinn of Morgan Stanley believes that most of the savings will come from the layoffs, however. &quot;If you estimate that each employee let go costs the company about $75,000 annually in salary and benefits, that's $150 million in savings if 2,000 employees are cut,&quot; she noted.    &quot;In the previous cuts they were cutting things other than (Exploration andamp; Production) and that's where these savings will come from,&quot; Ms. Quinn continued. &quot;From that standpoint I think this is a very good move for the company to get primary costs under control.&quot;    The Phillips spokesman said the company decided to lay off workers rather than embark on another early retirement program. The success of previous programs -- about 4,000 employees have taken early retirement since 1985 -- has left Phillips with only 5% of its work force above the age of 55. &quot;Given the demographics of the company, a voluntary early retirement program isn't in our best interests.&quot;    Despite the cutbacks, Phillips said that it plans &quot;no major changes&quot; in its capital spending program. Last year, the company budgeted about $730 million for capital expenditures and &quot;they'll be in that same neighborhood this year,&quot; the spokesman said.    In addition, Phillips said it indefinitely postponed a proposed issue of $400 million in convertible subordinated debentures due 2012, &quot;due to unsatisfactory market conditions.&quot; Phillips announced its intention to offer the debt in September, before the stock market crashed. Analysts said the fact that Phillips is continuing its capital expenditures funding was a sign that the withdrawal of the debt offering wasn't the impetus for the layoffs and consolidation.    &quot;They still have the cash to run the company,&quot; said Mr. Nowak of Dean Witter. &quot;Right now they're not capital-constrained and (the cutbacks are) intended to make sure they don't get that way.&quot;    In last year's fourth quarter, Phillips had revenue of $2.38 billion and profit from continuing operations of $17 million, including a gain of $12 million from the sale of assets. A loss of $6 million from discontinued operations made net income $11 million, or two cents a share. </TEXT></DOC>
