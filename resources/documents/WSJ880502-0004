At about 1 a.m. today, after four nights of lengthy deliberations, the OPEC oil ministers postponed action until a regularly scheduled June 8 meeting on last week's proposal by non-OPEC oil producers to reduce the flow of oil into world markets.    &quot;We want to examine it (the non-OPEC proposal) fully. . . . We don't want to come up with a half-baked arrangement,&quot; said Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and OPEC's president. He said, however, that new contacts would be made with the non-OPEC group.    &quot;We'll start talking straight away,&quot; Mr. Lukman said, &quot;and if we find it helpful, we will ask non-OPEC to the next meeting.&quot;    Mr. Lukman was about the only minister from the 13-nation cartel who would even discuss the matter. Other ministers said they had agreed to let Mr. Lukman do the talking -- apparently over concern on the impact of oil markets today.    But such caution is unlikely to prevent the price of oil from plunging this morning. &quot;It will fall 50 cents to $1 a barrel right away,&quot; said Oystein Berentsen, manager of crude oil trading for the British unit of Norway's Statoil, the government-owned oil company.    With the postponement of a decision on joint production cuts, the last lingering prospects for the birth of a world OPEC rapidly faded -- despite last week's unprecedented meetings here between representatives of a score of oil-exporting nations. Speculation about the prospects of a joint production-cutting effort had sent oil prices $3 a barrel higher in the past two months.    As previously reported, eight non-OPEC exporters offered to cut their production by an amount equal to 5% of their exports, or 183,000 barrels a day, in May and June -- if OPEC also trimmed its exports by a like percentage, or some 700,000 barrels a day. The non-OPEC group consisted of Mexico, Egypt, Angola, Oman, China, Malaysia, Colombia and Brunei.    When the OPEC ministers began their final session last night to further consider their response, they were trying to strike a last-minute compromise between two proposals. In one, the cartel would cut production by 300,000 barrels a day -- equivalent to roughly 2% of current OPEC output. Under the other proposal, OPEC would simply match the pledge of the non-OPEC nations to cut production 183,000 barrels a day.    The first proposal, offered late Friday night by Algeria and supported by eight of the 13 OPEC nations, was countered late Saturday night by the second, which was by Saudi Arabia. The Saudi proposal, which had the backing of other Arab producing states in the Persian Gulf region -- Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar -- called for equal barrel-for-barrel cuts by OPEC and non-OPEC nations, effectively splitting the cartel into two political blocs.    The Saudi proposal also would have distributed the reductions evenly among the OPEC nations -- which, excluding Iraq, participate in self-imposed quotas -- regardless of their production volumes.    Thus, under the kingdom's proposal, OPEC's heavyweights would have reduced output by the same minuscule amount -- 15,000 barrels a day -- as the smallest member. &quot;This is just not possible,&quot; said Etienne Guy Moubagha Tchioba, the Gabonese oil minister. He pointed out that under the Saudi proposal, the Saudis would have cut production by only 0.3% while Gabon would have to cut 10%.    The Saudi-led gesture also appeared to be unacceptable to the non-OPEC group that initiated the entire joint production-cutting effort. By yesterday morning, Egypt, Mexico and Oman -- the leaders of the non-OPEC group -- already had made their displeasure known.    After hours of sometimes acrimonious talks through the weekend -- held late at night, in observance of the Moslem holy time of Ramadan -- the OPEC factions held firm last night. Just the same, neither of the two production-cutting proposals, if implemented, would have had a major effect on the fundamentals of the world oil markets.    Even the Algerian proposal -- if followed to the letter and coupled with the non-OPEC cutbacks -- would have trimmed a total of less than 500,000 barrels a day from supplies going into oil markets, or only about 1% of non-Communist world consumption. Oil markets had expected more. Crude oil traders, here to keep an eye on developments, had expected markets to turn negative as a result. In fact, over the next few days, they had expected prices to decline $1 or $2 a barrel before firming again because of the expected higher petroleum demand this year.    But even a short-term decline in oil prices would still leave the oil exporters with the benefit of the $3-a-barrel runup in world oil prices since it became known that OPEC and the non-OPEC exporters might try to cooperate in balancing world oil markets. And despite the outcome of the latest deliberations, the coming together of the OPEC and non-OPEC groups remained a meaningful event. &quot;For the first time, it formalizes relationships&quot; between OPEC and other oil exporters, said Bahman Karbassioun, a Vienna consultant on OPEC activities.    But it raises new issues in OPEC, including the very definition of what should be counted as &quot;production&quot; under the cartel's quota system. For example, Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah of Kuwait charged that some members, specifically Venezuela, had been reclassifying certain crudes to get them outside the quota system.    Before cutting production, Kuwaiti oil minister said repeatedly, &quot;We have to get our own house in order.&quot;    Others argued that OPEC already has done enough to curb the world oil glut: OPEC's output has declined 40% since peaking in 1979, while non-OPEC exporters are producing at capacity.    Also, the changes in OPEC's power structure in the developments here could last well beyond the meetings. The split over the degree of production cuts pitted a faction of eight nations against the Persian Gulf Arab bloc. In the latter camp, Saudi Arabia may have made a tactical error by voting for these meetings to take place, and then objecting to much of a change in output. &quot;For the first time ever, the kingdom has been cornered,&quot; said one senior OPEC official.    Nevertheless, Saudi Arabia proved anew its power as the kingpin of world oil by dealing a death blow to the momentum that had been building toward widespread production cuts in OPEC.    After last night's meeting ended at about 1 a.m. today, Hisham M. Nazer, the Saudi oil minister, said, &quot;It has been a very good ending.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
