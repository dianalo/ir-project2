Even more incredible was the appearance of that typeprinted on my old ImageWriter.andP;  I don't know who will win the font wars, butI applaud Adobe for bringing out ATM.andM;Jerry FreilichandM;Athens, Ga.andM;Don't write off competing graphical user interfacesandM;As a former Mac manager, I always read Don Crabb's column with interest andfrequently with agreement.andP;  However, Nov.andP;  14's column stating that userinterfaces like X Windows, NeXT-Step and Presentation Manager are useless andthat everyone should be using the Mac interface is shortsighted.andM;The computer industry has had five years to find the holes in the Mac Finder.andO;Anyone who has used a Mac for any length of time can find problems.andP;  And thisbecomes even more pronounced as the Mac starts entering the realm ofmultitasking.andP;  That does not mean that the Mac interface is not good.andP;  It is.andO;But Don's opinion that progress is not needed or wanted just does not fitwith the direction of the computer industry as a whole.andM;Greg Orman, systems managerandM;Pomona CollegeandM;Claremont, Calif.andM;Swivel 3D not just for engineering professionalsandM;As an artist and CAD expert who has reviewed most 3-D programs on the market,I take issue with Chipp Walters' Nov.andP;  14 letter.andM;First, my review (MacWEEK, Sept.andP;  19) did not say that Swivel outperformsSuper 3D in &quot;just about every way&quot; but that in areas of innovative visualpresentation and as regards its unique linking tool in particular, Swivel wasthe reviewer's choice.andP;  Also, Walters' claim that Super 3D is marketed forengineers is unfounded since, according to the Silicon Beach manual, &quot;It is a...andP;  visualization tool for creative and technical professionals, yet itsunique interface allows even novices to ...andP;  create 3-D models andanimations.&quot; Unlike AutoCAD, VersaCAD, MiniCAD, MicroStation Mac and otherengineering CAD programs, Super 3D lacks the tools and dimensioning to beuseful as an engineering CAD program.andM;Finally, at the time of the review StrataVISION 3d wasn't shipping.andO;Therefore, Swivel had unmatched rendering for its price class.andM;Laslo VespremiandM;MacWEEK, contributing editorandM;San FranciscoandM;Editor Dan Ruby replies: Laslo Vespremi may be an &quot;artiste,&quot; as Chipp Waltersimplied, but he is also an expert user of Mac CAD and modeling software.andO;MacWEEK assigns reviewers on the basis of knowledge of comparable productsand experience in the application area.andP;  Vespremi qualifies on both counts.andO;As with any review, two knowledgeable users may disagree.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
