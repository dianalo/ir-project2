Bush has a sense of urgency on ``the overall situation, but themost important traits right now are patience and determination, tonot let urgency push you to say things or do things that would becounterproductive,'' said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.   ``We just don't have anything new today. It's a long process andwe need to be patient and let discussions flow back and forth ...but there's just no new developments,'' he told reporters.   ``We would like to lower our voices a little and let theseissues play out for a few days and see what happens,'' Fitzwatersaid.   He was asked about remarks in Beirut by the spiritual guide ofthe pro-Iranian group Hezbollah, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,who offered to help free Western hostages held in Lebanon if theWest helps release Arab prisoners held in Israel.   ``It's an interesting statement. We don't have any comment onit. ... We hope it signals their desire to release the hostages,''he said.   Fitzwater said there appeared to be no prospects for talks withthe Hezbollah, believed to be the umbrella organization for ShiiteMoslem factions holding most of the 16 hostages in Lebanon.   ``We always said we'd talk to anybody and seek any avenue forgetting the release of the hostages, but there's never really beenan opportunity for direct discussions'' with the hostage holders,Fitzwater said. ``Partly they haven't wanted to. We've said wewon't negotiate for hostages. It just hasn't been fruitful.''   Fitzwater said Thursday that the administration stands ready totalk to any party that can help win freedom for the Middle Easthostages _ including Iran _ but it is premature to expect directtalks with the new government in Tehran.   ``We want to keep the lines of communication open,'' he said.``We are prepared to talk to any party that can help with releaseof the hostages, including Iran.''   To talk directly with Tehran, however, he added, the UnitedStates would have to be sure it was dealing with ``authoritativeofficials who represented the government.'' He suggested it waspremature to expect such talks now, adding, ``We're nowhere nearthat.''   Bush himself had nothing to say Thursday about the hostages,expect to repeat his appeal to Americans to offer a special prayerfor them this weekend.   Fitzwater said the United States welcomes third-party contactswith Iran on the hostages, including a trip to Tehran planned nextweek by the foreign minister of Pakistan, Sahabzada Yaqub Khan.   Fitzwater, taking note of a report Thursday in theEnglish-language Tehran Times that indirect talks would open in afew days through a third country, possibly Pakistan, said he wasunaware of any ``special new talks.''   Fitzwater said Khan and other Pakistani officials have contactsin Iran and it is the administration's policy ``to leave no stoneunturned'' in seeking to win freedom of the U.S. hostages.   Fitzwater said he could not supply details of Khan's trip. Khanmade an unexpected visit to Washington last week, where he met withVice President Dan Quayle.   The vice president ``urged Pakistan to become involved inhelping facilitate the release of the hostages and to reveal toIran information that Pakistan has accumulated on the situation,''said Quayle spokesman David Beckwith.   Fitzwater told reporters the United States and Israel werediscussing efforts to free their hostages in Lebanon, but were notcoordinating their actions.   Israeli officials had said Israel's Prime Minister YitzhakShamir persuaded Bush in a 10-minute telephone call Wednesday tocoordinate efforts to release foreign hostages and Israeliprisoners held in Lebanon.   ``We've generally tried to be forthcoming with what we aredoing, and they have been forthcoming with what they're doing.However, I would not characterize it as coordination,'' Fitzwatersaid.</TEXT></DOC>
