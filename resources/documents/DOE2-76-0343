The effective chromium content is determinedfrom the sum of the content of chromium and molybdenum in wt.%. The effectivecarbon content is determined from the sum of the carbon content and thedetermined parts of nickel, silicon and nitrogen, or the content ratiosof stabilizing elements. The lowest value of the resistance parameteris determined as the characteristic value for the given medium, conditionsof use and equivalence of effective carbon content. The method of determiningthe resistance parameter is described in detail on the example of Cr18Ni9steel. (E.S.).</TEXT></DOC>
