Archibald Cox, chairman of the self-styled citizens' lobbyCommon Cause and a onetime Watergate special prosecutor,argued that the senators -- Alan Cranston (D., Calif.),Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.), John Glenn (D., Ohio), JohnMcCain (R., Ariz.), and Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) -- violatedthe Code of Ethics for Government Service in 1987. Thesenators accepted campaign contributions from CharlesKeating, the chairman of Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan's parentcompany, and then met with regulators to ask about theirexamination of Lincoln.</LP><TEXT>   In a brief filed with the Senate Ethics Committee, Mr. Coxsaid the lawmakers created the &quot;appearance&quot; that they acted&quot;in an official capacity in response to gifts or otherbenefits.&quot; Mr. Cox, who served as U.S. solicitor general inthe early 1960s, also asserted the senators violatedprovisions of the ethics code that public officials should&quot;never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of specialfavors or privileges to anyone.&quot;   The senators have denied any wrongdoing, arguing that theywere only looking into a constituent's problems, and thatthey didn't delay the takeover of Lincoln. Lincoln, based inIrvine, Calif., was seized by the government in April 1989.Its failure is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.   The ethics committee is investigating the actions of thesenators. Common Cause said it filed the brief &quot;to addressarguments that Senate rules and standards do not explicitlycover the actions involved.&quot;   In a news release, Sen. McCain said Mr. Cox &quot;is simplysaying people should be judged guilty by association.&quot; Theother senators couldn't be reached for comment.   Meanwhile, Mr. Bush was asked if he agreed with his son,Neil, who has suggested that savings-and-loan regulators areconducting a vendetta against him because he is thepresident's son. Neil Bush is being investigated by federalregulators and lawmakers because of his past relationshipwith the failed Silverado Banking, Savings andamp; Loan Associationin Denver. Its losses from speculative loans and insidertransactions are expected to cost taxpayers as much as $1billion.   &quot;As president, I'm determined to stay out of this and letit {the system} work and let it work fairly,&quot; Mr. Bush said.He added: &quot;I have confidence in the honor and integrity of myson. And if the system finds he's done something wrong, hewill be the first to step up and do what's right.&quot;   ---   Michel McQueen in Houston also contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
