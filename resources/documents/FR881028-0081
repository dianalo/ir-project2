Background</ITAG>Section 211(f)(1) of the Clean Air Act (Act), 42 U.S.C. 7545(f)(1), makesit unlawful for any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive to firstintroduce into commerce or to increase the concentration in use of anyfuel or fuel additive for general use in light-duty motor vehicles manufacturedafter model year 1974, which is not substantially similar to any fuel orfuel additive utilized in the certification of any model year 1975, orsubsequent model year, vehicle or engine under section 206 of the Act.Section 211(f)(4) of the Act, 42 U.S.C. 7545(f)(4), provides that the Administratorof EPA, upon application of any manufacturer of any fuel or fuel additive,may waive the prohibitions established under section 211(f)(1), if theAdministrator determines that the applicant has established that such fuelor fuel additive or a specified concentration thereof, and the emissionproducts of such fuel or additive or specified concentration thereof, willnot cause or contribute to a failure of any emission control device orsystem (over the useful life of any vehicle in which such device or systemis used) to achieve compliance by the vehicle with the emission standardswith respect to which it has been certified pursuant to section 206 ofthe Act. The same section specifies that if the Administrator does notact to grant or deny an application within 180 days of receipt of the application,the waiver authorized by section 211(f)(4) shall be treated as granted.The Texas Methanol Corporation received a waiver for a gasoline-alcoholfuel blend, known as OCTAMIX, consisting of a maximum of 3.7 percent byweight fuel oxygen, a maximum of 5 percent by volume methanol, a minimumof 2.5 percent by volume cosolvents and 42.7 milligrams/liter (mg/1) ofPetrolite TOLAD MFA-10 corrosion inhibitor. As was the case with a previouswaiver granted by EPA, the Agency invited other corrosion inhibitor manufacturersto submit test data to establish, on a case-by-case basis, whether theirformulations are acceptable as alternatives to TOLAD MFA-10. (<T3>See</T3> Reconsideration of DuPont Waiver, 51 FR 39400, October 31,1986.)On April 25, 1988, E. I. DuPont de Nemours and Co., Inc., (DuPont) requestedthat EPA allow the use of an alternative corrosion inhibitor, DMA-67, inOCTAMIX, DMA-67 is a formulation consisting of a corrosion inhibitor anda carburetor detergent, much like Petrolite's TOLAD MFA-10.On July 7, 1988, EPA published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 25537) announcing receipt of DuPont'srequest and inviting comment on it. The comment period closed August 8,1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion</ITAG>One of the major areas of concern to EPA in reviewing any waiver requestis the problem of materials compatibility. Materials compatibility datacould show a potential failure of fuel systems, emissions related partsand emission control parts from use of the fuel or additive. Any failurecould result in greater emissions.Initially, Texas Methanol requested the use of TOLAD MFA-10 or an appropriateconcentration of any other corrosion inhibitor such that the fuel willpass the National Association of Corrosion Engineers's test TM-01-72 (NACERust Test). However, EPA concluded that compliance with the NACE Rust Testalone was not adequate in determining the suitability of a corrosion inhibitor.(<T3>See </T3>OCTAMIX decision 53 FR 3636, February 8, 1988.) The Agencydecided, therefore, to look at corrosion inhibitors on a case-by-case basisto establish whether each formulation as environmentally acceptable.In a prior decision involving a gasoline-alcohol fuel with a compositionvery similar to OCTAMIX, EPA concluded that DMA-67 was comparable to TOLADMFA-10 and DGOI-100 (another DuPont additive which contains a corrosioninhibitor). <T3>See</T3> 52 FR 18736, May 19, 1987. DuPont incorporated by referencethe same supporting information into this application as was consideredin that decision.The principal ingredient in DMA-67 relative to corrosion inhibition isDCI-11, which is currently used in over 80 percent of the fuel grade ethanolmanufactured in the United States. DCI-11 was specifically designed toprovide corrosion protection to gasoline-alcohol blends.In order to determine whether the OCTAMIX waiver would meet the criteriaof section 211(f) if DMA-67 were to be<ITAG tagnum="54">used as an inhibitor, EPA reviewed all data submitted with or referencedby the application. The only commenter, Ford Motor Company, stated thatit had reviewed the data and rationale presented in the application andhad no objection for approval of the waiver modification at this time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">III. Finding and Conclusion</ITAG>Based of the information submitted by DuPont in its application, I concludethat the performance of DMA-67 in OCTAMIX would be comparable to TOLADMFA-10. Therefore, I am modifying condition (3) of the OCTAMIX waiver toread as follows:(3) Any one of the following two corrosion inhibitor formulations mustbe included:(a) Petrolite's corrosion inhibitor formulation, TOLAD MFA-10, blendedin the final fuel at 42.7 mg/1;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">  OR,(b) DuPont's corrosion inhibitor formulation, DMA-67, blended in the finalfuel at 31.4 mg/1.This should provide additional flexibility to any manufacturer wishingto produce the OCTAMIX blend. At the same time, any manufacturer wishingto use a corrosion inhibitor other than the two permitted by the OCTAMIXwaiver must apply for a further revision of the waiver. Since EPA is stillunaware of any basis for extrapolating findings in the emissions impactof one inhibitor to other inhibitors, the Agency will continue to examinethe emissions impact of specific corrosion inhibitor formulations on acase-by-case basis.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Miscellaneous</ITAG>EPA has determined that this action does not meet any of the criteria forclassification as a major rule under Executive Order 12291. Therefore,no regulatory impact analysis is required.This action is not a ``rule'' as defined in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601(2), because EPA is not required to undergo ``notice andcomment'' under section 553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act or otherlaw. Therefore, EPA has not prepared a supporting regulatory flexibilityanalysis addressing the impact of this section on small business entities.This is a final Agency action of national applicability. Jurisdiction toreview this action lies exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals for theDistrict of Columbia Ciruit. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, judicialreview of this action is available only by the filing of a petition forreview in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuitwithin 60 days of the date of publication of this notice. Under section307(b)(2), judicial review may not be obtained in any subsequent judicialproceeding brought by the Agency to enforce the statutory prohibitions.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 21, 1986.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.
