 While it may fall short ofthis description in a number of areas, it does have its uses.andM;Symmetry IV tries to separate itself from other dBASE programming tools byincluding a dBASE-specific data dictionary.andP;  (Data dictionaries are commonlyused with databases to define and document the structure of tables of tablesor data files and the meanings of each of the fields in the files.)andO;Unfortunately, none of the current PC dBASE language compilers andinterpreters on the market includes a data dictionary--the information storedin the DBF file structure is minimal.andM;Symmetry IV also includes tools for cross referencing and structure charting,building procedure and batch fileS, and analyzing label and report formfiles.andP;  It also has a text editor, but I found it inadequate for most editingtasks--though you can use it to view some of the system-generated reports.andM;InstallationandM;Installing Symmetry IV was fairly simple.andP;  No obtuse menu-driven instalationprogram is required--just use the DOS COPY command to copy files from thedistribution disks into a subdirectory on your hard disk.andP;  Then use theInstallation option from the Utilities menu in each of the two main SymmetryIV programs--the Dictionary and the Documentor.andP;  The product isn't copyprotected.andP;  A separate program, INSTALL.EXE, is used to change the standardkeyboard assignments of the editor included with Symmetry IV.andP;  Other optionsare set through the Utilities menu in each program.andM;The DictionaryandM;Symmetry IV's data dictionary lets you record the DBF files USEd by yourdBASE application, as well as their structure and descriptions for each ofthe fields.andP;  You can record your application's indexes and link them to theDBF file they belong to.andP;  You can also attach free form text comments to thedescriptions of each DBF file, field, and index.andP;  Fib.andP;  1 shows the createdictionary screen.andM;The Dictionary automates some of the dictionary loading process for you byscanning your source code, looking for the USE commands.andP;  Some commands, suchas SET INDEX, are also recognized, but Symmetry IV doesn't seem to be able tolink the indexes referenced by these commands to the associated data file.andO;Scanning the source code, Symmetry processes any program files called by thefile you supply (and any files called by those files).andM;When scanning source code, the current version of Symmetry IV can't interpretmacros (andamp;) used to substitute DBF and NDX file names or locations.andP;  Thismeans the source code scanning doesn't work at all with some commercial dBASEsource code packages (such as SBT's accounting modules).andP;  However, accordingto the company, a new release of the product due soon will offer full macrosupport by including a special comment (*\) in the code: &quot;*\ DO FILENAME&quot;.andM;You can also load DBF files into the Dictionary by specifying thesubdirectory (you aren't allowed to specify a set of files).andP;  If you use auser-defined function (UDF) to open data files, you can tell Symmetry toextract the DBF name from the UDF by specifying its name during installationor when setting up options for scanning the source code.andM;You add index file defitions to the Dictionary by having Symmetry IV scanyour source code--you can't load them by reading them in from a diskdirectory.andP;  Symmetry IV can read FoxBASE+ (IDX), Clipper (NTX), and dBASE IIIPLUS and dBASE IV (NDX and MDX) indexes, but it requires the index fileextension to be the default for the particular dBASE product (e.g., you can'tuse indexes that end in NDX with FoxBASE+).andP;  When I tried to add an indexdirectly to the Dictionary, I found that I couldn't define the index keyexpression (used in the dBASE INDEX ON command).andM;There are some limitations to the Symmetry IV data dictionary.andP;  It doesn'thave a way to specify the relationship between one field and another.andP;  Forexample, there's no way to tell the Dictionary that the ITEM field in thetransaction file must have a valid inventory item number.andP;  Your only optionis to include this information in the memo text for a particular field.andM;Another problem is its inability to directly integrate the dBASE programs.andO;It isn't easy to make changes to Dictionary files and then create updated DBFfiles directly from the dictionary.andP;  And because the Dictionary files aren'tstored in DBF file format, you can't write dBASE code to bypass thelimitations in the data dictionary program.andM;One option allows you to export the data dictionary to a dBASE DBF fileformat, but it's very awkward.andP;  Symmetry IV only exports to delimited textfiles.andP;  It provides empty DBF files that match the structure of the exportedfile.andP;  After exporting to a text file, you must use a dBASE-compatibleinterpreter (or program) to append the text file to the supplied data files.andO;Any descriptive text attached to a DBF or field definition is lost in theprocess.andM;The DocumentorandM;Symmetry IV includes a separate program, called the Symmetry Documentor, foranalyzing and maintaining source code.andP;  The reports it produces areindependent of any data dictionary you've set up for the application in theSymmetry Dictionary.andP;  A tighter coupling between the Documentor andDictionary would be helpful.andM;The Documentor provides a number of reporting and analyzing tools fordocumenting dBASE applications.andP;  The reports include a System StructureChart, Hierarchy Analysis, Analysis and Listing of Files (DBFs, FRMs, LBLs,indexes, and PRGs) used in the system (including the structures of the DBFfiles), statistics on the program and data file sizes and complexity,extraction of program comments, and matches of database files to theirassociated indexes (see Fig.andP;  2).andM;The options and settings you specify for the reports and other tools in theDocumentor can be saved to Project files.andP;  You can later recall them when youwork on the application.andM;Maybe the best feature of the Documentator is its ability to batch processany or all of the reports.andP;  Symmetry took about 25 minutes to completelyprocess a very large dBASE application (a 1,200K accounting application)--notvery long to grind through that much source code.andP;  If you specify exactlywhich reports you need and whether to print them or send them to a file.andO;Symmetry can run the whole thing unattended.andM;You can have Symmetry reindent an entire dBASE application just by giving itthe name of the top level program file.andP;  You can separately specify thenumber of indent spaces for each DO WHILE, IF, DO CASE, CASE, BEGIN, SCAN,and FOR command in your source code.andP;  Symmetry will scan the source code,correctly indenting the code inside each IF...ENDIF, DO WHILE...ENDDO, etc.andO;You can also use the stand-alone reindenting program to only reindent asingle program file.andM;The Documentor's global search, change, and delete processes let you makeconsistent changes throughout the application's source code.andP;  Theseoperations worked fairly quickly and came with a complete set of options tocontrol the search and replace parameters.andP;  I encountered just oneproblem--after a search operation, the lines of my source code in the outputfile were convrted to upper case and left-justified.andP;  I would rather the caseand indentation be left as in the original file.andM;You can condense all programs in a subdirectory into a single procedure file.andO;By supplying the name of the top level program, you tell Symmetry which setof files to include in the procedure file.andP;  You can't specify a set of filesby using a file name with wildcards (like you can with the FoxBIND utilityincluded with FoxBASE+).andP;  You can set a limit on the number of programsincluded in the procedure file if the dBASE interpreter you'll be usingsupports only a limited number of procedures per procedure file.andM;Symmetry IV can scan a dBASE application and copy or erase all of the filesused by the application from the directory they're in.andP;  This is less usefulthan it sounds.andP;  The example in the documentation uses the Copy option andthen the Erase option to move an application to another directory.andP;  Not onlydoes this take substantially longer than just copying the files through DOS,it also removes the files that may be shared by another application in thatsubdirectory.andM;Symmetry IV can also build DOS batch files to process all of yourapplication's files with any DOS command you specify.andP;  As with the otheroperations, the list of files to process is built by supplying the top levelprogram file and letting Symmetry scan your application's dBASE source code.andM;The Professional EditorandM;Symmetry IV provides a basic text editor that you can run as a stand-aloneprogram from DOS or from the main menu of the Symmetry Dictionary andDocumentor.andP;  The Editor is also used to edit memo fields in the Dictionary.andM;If features an auto-indent feature that lets you reindent the PRG file you'reediting with the press of a key.andP;  Fig.andP;  3 shows the menu where you set indentsettings.andM;The editor suffers from some fairly severe limitations when compared tomodern program editors.andP;  You can only edit one file at a time.andP;  Keyboardmacros aren't supported, though you can redefine the standard key assignmentswith an external program.andP;  The editor only supports an 80 x 25 screen(actually 78 columns X 21 lines) and doesn't support EGA 43-line or VGA50-line display modes.andM;I couldn't find a file size limit for the editor in the documentation but thetechnical support person I spoke to said it was limited to 64K.andP;  According tothe manual, line length is limited to 256 characters (I coudln't get pastcolumn 249).andM;I also found that I couldn't load and view a number of the reports SymmetryIV produced from a dBASE application (about 500K of source code) because theywere too large for the editor.andM;When I tried to change the installation of the Symmetry Dictionary to use anexternal editor to get around the file size limitations (I tried BRIEFversion 2.11), I wasn't able to load it because of insufficient memory (mymachine had 486K free RAM before starting Symmetry).andM;Other utilitiesandM;Symmetry IV has a separate source code reindenting program that supports allthe control structures, including those in dBASE IV.andP;  The indenter can onlyprocess a single program file at a time.andM;Another utility lists the structure of DBF files from the DOS command line.andO;Unfortunately, this utility can only display the structure of one DBF file ata time, since it doesn't accept wildcards in the file name, and it won't letyou redirect the output to a text file.andM;Erro trappingandM;I found error trapping generally very good in Symmetry IV, although a printeroff-line error was trapped only the first time (a &quot;No&quot; answer to the retryquestion hung my machine).andP;  The error messages are clear and concise.andP;  A listof error messages is included in the program's documentation but withoutexplanations on how to resolve them.andM;Symmetry IV provides an external program to rebuild the indexes for thedictionary data files if they become corrupted.andM;What the future holdsandM;As I mentioned, a new release of Symmetry IV (version 1.01) is due in just afew months.andP;  The new version will allow bolding and underlining key commands(such as DO...ENDDO) and includes standard printer drivers for HP laser andEpson-compatible printers.andP;  The price of the new version will remain the sameas the current price.andP;  Users can upgrade for $25.andM;DocumentationandM;Symmetry IV's documentation consists of about 170 loose-leaf pages, packagedin a binder and slipcase.andP;  It includes an index and glossary, sample reports,and a list of error messages.andM;The documentation is useful as a reference manual but it lacks acomprehensive tutorial section describing how to use the product to developor maintain a dBASE application.andM;All of Symmetry's programs offered on-line help, and I found thecontext-sensitive help screens useful.andP;  They displayed information about myavailable options from the current screen.andM;Technical supportandM;The documentation doesn't mention a limit to Symmetry Software's technicalsupport, and a company representative confirmed that they don't have a policylimiting support.andP;  But I couldn't find the company phone number anywhere inthe documentation.andP;  To call their technical support, I had to find anadvertisement for the product and get the number from that.andM;I called technical support on Symmetry's toll free number and receivedimmediate and knowledgeable replies to my questions without being put on holdor being asked for a serial number.andM;ConclusionandM;Although Symmetry IV doesn't seem to be a fully mature product, it does havesome unique and useful features.andP;  Its Dictionary provides a way to documentthe data files used in an existing dBASE application, but it's limited indesigning data structures for new applications.andM;Symmetry IV's Documentor provides powerful tools for documenting andmanipulating the source code of entire applications, including reindentingand global search and replace.andM;The editor isn't in the same league as other program editors like BRIEF orQEdit.andP;  Don't buy Symmetry to replace the editor built into dBASE IV.andP;  Yourmoney would be better spent on a program editor and macro package (likedBrief) to customize the editor.andM;Would I recommend Symmetry IV?andP;  Not as the &quot;complete development package fordBASE programmers,&quot; as it says on the packaging.andP;  However, if you're juststarting to program in dBASE IV or another dBASE environment, Symmetry IVprovides you with most of the functions you need to produce technicaldocumentation for your applications, and the Symmetry Dictionary adds a vitalfeature missing from the dBASE language.andM;The priceandM;Symmetry IV, version 1.00 is priced at $149.95 and require DOS 2.0 or greater(tested under DOS 3.3), 640K RAM (works in 450K), a hard disk, and an IBMPC/XT/AT or PS/2 compatible.andP;  The network version sells for $395.andP;  It comeswith a 30-day money-back guarantee.andM;Symmetry Software, Inc. is located at 850 Boylston St., Suite 402B, ChestnutHill, Mass.andP;  02167, phone (617) 734-2918 (in Mass.) or (800) 544-2599.andM;James Buzzard owns a database and application design consulting firm,Hammerhead Systems.andP;
