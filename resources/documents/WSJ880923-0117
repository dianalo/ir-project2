The ruling is the latest obstacle blocking Seabrook's low-power test licensing, and a victory for Seabrook's determined opponents, including the state of Massachusetts.    The commission voted unanimously to require that the owners, a group of 11 utilities, submit a plan within 30 days to demonstrate that adequate funds would be available to meet the steep expenses that could be required to close the plant. Once the plant operates -- even at low power for testing -- the closing costs could be in the hundreds of millions of dollars in part because of the radioactive waste generated, James Shannon, the Massachusetts attorney general, estimated.    However, others familiar with the plant say Mr. Shannon's estimate of the decommissioning cost is way too high. &quot;We think it's at most a quarter of what he's talking about, at most $50 million,&quot; said Wilbur Ross Jr. of Rothschild Inc., financial adviser to the equity committee in the Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law case of Public Service Co. of New Hampshire, which owns a 36% stake in Seabrook. &quot;If $50 million is the right number, (PS of New Hampshire's) share is about $17.5 million,&quot; Mr. Ross said, adding that he believes meeting that cost wouldn't be a problem.    The question of financial ability of the owners has become an issue in part because of PS of New Hampshire's filing for bankruptcy-court protection from its creditors in January, after it was denied a rate increase. In addition, Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric Corp., an 11.59% owner, is seeking to withdraw from the project.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, PS of New Hampshire, which holds the largest stake in Seabrook, closed unchanged yesterday at $4.375 a share.    Even if the owners of Seabrook prove they can afford to close the plant, the commission said it will consider the separate issue of whether the operators are financially fit to run a nuclear power plant.    These issues must be resolved before the commission determines whether to issue a low-power license for testing and training plant workers at 5% of power. Opponents have threatened further litigation to block the full license.    Seabrook's owners recently sidestepped other opposition to its emergency evacuation plans. Seabrook opponents in Massachusetts removed mandatory emergency sirens from public buildings in efforts to block the licensing. But the commission approved an evacuation plan that no longer required off-site sirens. </TEXT></DOC>
