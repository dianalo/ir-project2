The diplomats also said the country's ruling Peoples DemocraticParty is changing its name and that of its newspaper in an effort tobroaden its appeal and remove references to the bloody 1978revolution it rode to power.   The moves coincide with the exodus of Soviet civilian advisersfrom the Afghan capital and warnings from foreign embassies thattheir nationals leave the country unless they have essentialbusiness, the diplomats said.   Under U.N.-mediated accords, half of the roughly 100,000 Soviettroops that had been in Afghanistan fighting Moslem guerrillas leftthe country by Aug. 15 and the balance are to be out by Feb. 15.   Soviet troops intervened in Afghanistan to prop up the governmentin 1979.   In the western part of the country, the Soviet pullout has begunfrom Shindad and Herat, said the Islamabad-based diplomats, whospoke on condition of anonymity. They quoted Afghan officials assaying the the main military withdrawal will begin Jan. 15.   The diplomats said senior members of the Peoples Democratic Partyof Afghanistan have been allocated apartments in Mazar-e-Sharief,165 miles northeast of Kabul. Most of them have sent theirdependents and household goods to town near the Soviet border.   The Special Guard, which protects party and government officials,has increased to at least 4,000 members and is expected to rise to20,000 to withstand guerrilla attacks when the Soviets leave, thediplomats said.   Special Aeroflot flights have taken Soviet advisers from thecapital, and the Soviet Embassy has been reduced to about 100workers, the diplomats said.   The ruling party will change its name to the Liberal, Democraticand National Party and adopt ``free market policies along the linesof Western Social Democratic parties,'' said one Western diplomat,citing Afghan sources.   The name of the party newspaper has been changed from Truth ofthe April Revolution to the more moderate Message, diplomats said.   ``The symbolism of junking the name of the (April 1978)revolution ... is probably only the first in a series of stepsdesignated to paper over the image of the (party) as a revolutionarycommunist party,'' another diplomat said.   A cease-fire President Najib offered on New Year's Day has beenignored by guerrillas and by government troops.   State-run radio said 82 people _ including 79 guerrillas _ werekilled and 40 wounded in fighting Sunday and Monday. It said thethree others were civilians. There was no independent confirmation.   Western diplomats reported that 132 people were killed in heavybombing by the Soviet and Afghan air force just north of Kabul onDec. 26 and Dec. 27.   The diplomats estimated that 100 guerrillas, 20 civilians, and 12government troops were killed in the bombing.   Anti-communist guerrillas also have renewed attacks on othergovernment-held cities. Tass today reported that security forcesuncovered a guerrilla storehouse in the capital with 84 rockets,grenades and more than 300 rifles.</TEXT></DOC>
