First Boston's senior management came under criticism from people inside and outside the firm for failing to retain these investment bankers at a time when the firm still is recovering from the loss of its biggest deal makers, Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella.    &quot;You have to blame management&quot; in part for the defections, said Perrin Long, a securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., who noted that First Boston has experienced a number of other defections in recent months.    Still, Peter T. Buchanan, First Boston's chief executive officer, denied that the departure would have any significant effect on the firm's leveraged buy-out business. &quot;These are nice fellows and I wish them well,&quot; Mr. Buchanan said, adding that for First Boston, &quot;it means we have to move some people around; it's no big deal.&quot;    He said that &quot;we have an awful lot of people with exactly the same talent and who will have no problem filling in for them.&quot; The seven departing executives said they will stay with First Boston until their sucessors can be picked and put in place.    The group, headed by managing directors Arthur Nagle and Daniel O'Connell, is said by industry sources to have lined up several institutions and individuals as financial backers, including the highly successful leveraged buy-out investor Raymond Chambers of Wesray Corp.    The seven join an increasingly long line of investment bankers specializing in high-profit deal making who have decided to go out on their own in pursuit of more money and influence, leaving behind large organizations with high overhead and low profit margins in many other aspects of the business, particularly securities trading and sales.    The seven bankers structured and administered the firm's leveraged buy-outs. Such work is an offshoot of the mergers and acquisitions business in which an investment bank typically helps a company's management buy the company with borrowed funds and equity from investors. The investors are lined up by the investment bank and often include the investment bank. While many investment bankers, analysts and traders contribute to each leveraged buy-out, these seven formed a group that worked on such deals full time.    The resignation surpised many people close to the firm. Mr. Nagle, 49 years old, was a 20-year veteran of First Boston and considered very loyal to the firm. Mr. O'Connell, 34, was a rising star who some insiders said was one of the firm's most highly compensated performers last year. &quot;Dan O'Connell was the crown jewel&quot; of the leveraged buy-out operation, said one Wall Street executive.    Mr. Nagle said those leaving had &quot;no problems with the firm&quot; but simply concluded that &quot;here's a chance to be an owner-manager&quot; just as many of their leveraged buy-out clients are.    He stressed that the departure didn't involve any ideological struggle over the firm's future, such as the one that led to the departures of Messrs. Wasserstein and Perella. The group and First Boston said they hope to work together on deals in the future.    Mr. Nagle declined to comment on whether Mr. Chambers is one of his backers in the new venture, which is still without a title. Mr. Chambers, along with former Treasury Secretary William Simon, created in Morristown, N.J.-based Wesray one of the most successful companies that invest in leveraged buy-outs. Mr. Chambers couldn't be reached for comment.    While leveraged buy-outs are lucrative for First Boston, the firm recently seemed to be placing more of its efforts on bridge loans, another offshoot of the mergers and acquisitions business in which the firm provides short-term financing to help a client complete a merger. The firm will reap profits of more than $50 million on a $1.8 billion bridge loan to Campeau Corp. to aid the Canadian concern's $6.6 billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc. The firm's leveraged buy-outs generally have been much smaller by comparison, in the range of $100 million to $300 million transactions. </TEXT></DOC>
