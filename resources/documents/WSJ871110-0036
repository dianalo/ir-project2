In June, National Amusements, a Dedham, Mass.-based theater chain, acquired 83% of Viacom International, a cable-television, entertainment and broadcasting company, through a buy-out financed largely by bank debt that's now reflected on Viacom's balance sheet.    For the third quarter, Viacom had a loss of $37.5 million, compared with a profit of $3.4 million for the predecessor company a year earlier. Year-to-year figures aren't fully comparable because of an accounting change effected after the acquisition. Revenue in the third quarter rose 10% to $256.5 million from $233.3 million.    For the nine months, Viacom's loss totaled $87.9 million, compared with a loss of $10.6 million a year earlier. Nine-month revenue rose 11% to $745 million from $672.8 million.    Viacom's operating income before depreciation and amortization expenses rose 25% in the quarter to $64.4 million from $51.7 million.    Viacom said its cable and broadcasting segments led gains. Operating income from cable television rose 27% for the quarter. Operating income from broadcasting rose 19%. </TEXT></DOC>
