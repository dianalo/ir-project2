He said Sun might have a &quot;slight loss&quot; for the quarter, but the relentlessly upbeat executive said the miscues had been corrected and sales would quickly rebound.    Barely seven weeks later, however, the Mountain View, Calif., workstation maker conceded that its problems were worse than it had let on. In late July, Sun said its loss for the fiscal fourth quarter, which ended June 30, could reach $26 million and acknowledged that it might not earn a profit in its current quarter as well.    What went wrong at Sun to alter the company's outlook? Three costly problems -- one new and two others the company failed to fix -- have left Sun reeling after seven years of sizzling growth.    First, the company failed to halt hiring quickly after sales slowed due to production, order and inventory problems. In the past five weeks, Sun has added nearly 1,000 workers, even as its top managers publicly vowed to &quot;freeze&quot; hiring of nonessential personnel. Sun employs about 10,000 people.    &quot;Managers clung too long to the idea that they could clean things up right away,&quot; says Russ Crabs, an analyst at SoundView Financial Group, Stamford, Conn. &quot;Because they anticipated a quick comeback, many rushed ahead, hiring a whole year's worth of people even before&quot; the new fiscal year began.    Second, Sun's troubled information system -- its computerized record-keeping network -- is still trouble, even though the company said in June it had been resolved.    When Sun finally installed a new information system in April, after considering such a move for years, it didn't work. For several weeks, the company lost track of orders, inventory and other crucial aspects of its business. Sun has since corrected the worst problems, but the system still doesn't track inventory well or spit out certain key reports. As a result, to close the books on its June quarter, Sun must now finish some of the accounting work by hand, a spokeswoman says.    At about the same time that its information-system problems erupted, Sun introduced five major new computers. But delays in producing some of the machines prompted Sun to shift its sales strategy. &quot;When the new products slipped a couple of weeks, we told the sales force to start pushing the old products again,&quot; Ed Zander, Sun's vice president of marketing, said in a June interview. As a result, Sun sold more of its older computers than expected early in the fiscal fourth quarter. &quot;My forecast was wrong,&quot; Mr. Zander conceded.    Since late May, however, a bigger problem has emerged: Sun misjudged the popularity of its new, lower-priced Sparcstation 1, a fast desktop machine dubbed the &quot;pizza box&quot; because of its flat, compact design. Demand for the machine, which uses a Sun-designed microprocessor called Sparc, has outpaced initial forecasts by at least a factor of 10, causing a painful shortage of parts. Color monitors are in shortest supply, making it impossible for the company to fill many orders, an insider says.    Moreover, the popularity of the Sparc-based computers cannibalized sales of Sun computers using microprocessors made by Intel and Motorola to a greater degree than the company had expected, Mr. Crabs says. Even though the Sparc-based machines are in short supply, many consumers who might have bought the older machines have simply decided to wait for the new ones, hurting Sun's sales for now.    Sun's sales shortfall and feverish hiring means the company probably won't make money in the quarter ending Sept. 30. The prospect of two losing quarters in a row is prompting questions about the ability of Mr. McNealy, the chief executive, to control Sun's operations.    &quot;McNealy's credibility obviously has suffered a great deal,&quot; says Robert Herwick, an analyst at the brokerage firm Hambrecht andamp; Quist in New York. &quot;There's been a loss of confidence in him.&quot;    What's worse for Sun, these miscalculations have coincided with decisions by several important Sun executives to leave the company. In June, for instance, chief financial officer Joseph Graziano jumped to rival Apple Computer Inc.; a major debt package unraveled in his wake. In April, Bernard Lacroute, the company's chief operating officer and Mr. McNealy's right-hand man, left the company out of frustration with Sun's &quot;hectic pace&quot; and lack of controls.    To push into new markets, Mr. McNealy had sponsored dozens of autonomous units within the company. Mr. Lacroute held this unwieldy organization together, but despite his efforts, by this year these overlapping fiefdoms had spawned confusion and waste. The most damaging consequence of this infighting emerged in sales, where different divisions battled one another for the same customers. &quot;Our salesmen were confused, and our sales managers were confused,&quot; Mr. Zander said. &quot;Our competition understood our own strategy better than we did.&quot;    Mr. Lacroute's departure prompted Mr. McNealy to reorganize the company, a move many inside Sun considered long overdue. Mr. Lacroute's responsibilities have been spread among a group of senior executives. Besides reducing the company's welter of development projects and streamlining sales and marketing, Sun also has targeted its customer-service operation for improvement.    Though these moves will strengthen Sun, some outsiders believe the company's top management is thin. &quot;They need to find a replacement&quot; for Mr. Lacroute, says Vinod Khosla, a Sun co-founder who is now a partner in the San Francisco venture-capital firm that Mr. Lacroute joined recently.    Sun, known for flouting tradition, has built a huge following among engineers and other &quot;techie&quot; professionals by selling high-performance machines designed to run smoothly in networks. After routing smaller competitors in the work-station market, Sun raced after the computer industry's giants with a bold strategy built around the Sparc microprocessor and an invitation to other manufacturers to &quot;clone&quot; its newest machines.    Now competitors, the target of Sun gibes for years, are eager to take advantage of the company's difficulties. Hewlett-Packard Co., which gained the lead in the market for technical workstations following its purchase of Apollo Computer Inc., recently mailed a &quot;Sun survival kit&quot; to Sun customers promising to &quot;help you get out of the Sun.&quot; Digital Equipment Corp., also on the offensive, earlier this year introduced computers that are priced favorably against Sun's.    International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest computer maker, is expected to introduce this fall a new family of computers aimed at Sun's traditional customers. IBM has failed in its past attempts to crack the huge workstation market, but the new effort appears to be shaping up better.    &quot;I'm worried about IBM,&quot; Mr. Khosla says. &quot;It's going to be a strong announcement.&quot;    ---@ Sun Microsystems @ SALES EARNINGS STOCK @ QTR.
