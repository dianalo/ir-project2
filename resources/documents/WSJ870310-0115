After nearly five years of staying up late, thinking of new ways to block U.S. support for the democratic resistance fighting the Sandinistas, they are now trying to turn the fate of the Nicaraguan people over to accountants.    Tomorrow the House will vote on a Democratic proposal to place a six-month moratorium on $40 million in contra aid -- aid Congress voted for last year but that hasn't yet been delivered. The aid would be held in escrow while the Reagan administration prepared a full accounting of how all previous aid had been spent. Of course the delay would effectively disarm the contras and cement into place the first Soviet-client state on the American mainland.    Maybe the reasons the House Democrats won't let the contras stand and fight for what they believe in is because the Democrats themselves no longer stand and fight for their beliefs. The House's liberals want to pull the plug on the rebels but, lacking the courage to hold a straight up or down vote on that policy and expose its consequences to the U.S. electorate, they have to disguise their intentions as a funding &quot;moratorium.&quot;    Moratorium supporters cite irregularities in the disbursement of past U.S. humanitarian aid to the contras. Charges of corruption have been raised. It may be true that some money has gone astray, and investigators should pursue the issue. But the security interests of the U.S. in keeping a second neighboring country out of the communist orbit shouldn't have to wait for a congressional foreign-policy team that won't act until it gets the Good Housekeeping seal of approval from the General Accounting Office.    Declaring a &quot;moratorium&quot; on Nicaragua's civil war would if little else allow the country's junta to consolidate its power and position the military materiel being shipped in from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact countries. Nicaragua's economic needs, meanwhile, are being ministered to by, incredibly, some of the NATO allies. West European countries, including several NATO members, last year sent tens of millions of dollars in economic aid to the contras' enemies -- the Sandinista junta.    Spain, the newest member of NATO, increased its official line of credit to Nicaragua by $26 million last year, according to the Sandinista daily Nuevo Diario. Norway sent $11 million worth of fertilizer, paper, machines and technical assistance while Denmark granted Nicaragua $9 million in soft loans.    Last month, more than 200 members of European parliaments wrote a joint letter to members of Congress, opposing aid to the contras fighting what the Europeans called, &quot;the democratically elected government of Nicaragua.&quot; When Rep. Jim Courter (R., N.J.) wrote back to object, a spokesman for the Embassy of the Netherlands said that attempts to convince his government to end its own aid program were seen as &quot;interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation.&quot; Sweden's ambassador to the U.S., Wilhelm Wachtmeister, coolly replied that his country was increasing its annual assistance from $14 million to $19 million. &quot;Given the severe constraints Nicaragua is facing, it would seem premature to conclude that these efforts {to bring democracy} in Nicaragua will not be successful,&quot; he wrote.    At least the Europeans have a plausible excuse for this preposterousness: Much of their junta aid is no doubt a sop to the left in their own countries. It's harder to see what excuse the House Democrats have for declaring a &quot;moratorium&quot; on U.S. foreign policy. What the Europeans and House Democrats seem to share in common, however, is the apparent belief that if they close their eyes and wish hard enough, somebody -- the Contadora countries or unarmed Costa Rica or maybe the U.S. special prosecutor -- will make all that unfortunate military nastiness in Central America go away.    It won't of course. If the Sandinistas remain in power, they will surely carry out their promise to spread revolution throughout Central America. The U.S. will have no choice but to invoke the Monroe Doctrine and spend more of its defense budget securing its southern flank by blockading or finally invading communist Nicaragua.    The House Democrats know this, and we suspect that even the ambassador from Sweden knows this. But when the day of reckoning comes, they no doubt also assume that someone else, possibly even a Democratic U.S. president, will bear full, personal responsibility for cleaning up their mess. </TEXT></DOC>
