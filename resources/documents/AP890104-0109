He immediately shook hands with House Speaker Jim Wright andgrinned as members of the House and Senate accorded him a standingovation.   Bush's pronouncement of his election and that of VicePresident-elect Dan Quayle before a joint session of Congress cappeda carefully choreographed bit of stagecraft as old as the Republic.   The final tally gave Bush 426 votes. Democrat Michael Dukakisreceived 111 and Democratic vice presidential running mate LloydBentsen received one.   That comported almost exactly with the results of the election,with the exception of one West Virginia elector, Margarette Leach ofWest Virginia, who cast her vote for Bentsen instead of Dukakis.   Quayle did not attend the vote-counting ceremony, his officesaid, because he had no official role and thought it more importantto work on private meetings concerning hiring his staff and plansfor the Jan. 20 Inauguration.   ``He didn't want to go. It would have just been a photo op,''said press secretary Dave Beckwith, adding that Quayle's staff haddiscussed the matter with the Bush staff. Since Quayle is no longera senator _ his successor was sworn in Tuesday _ and not yet thevice president, there was no need for him to be there, Beckwith said.   The outcome was utterly lacking in suspense, yet it was an eventthat has not occurred in precisely these circumstances since thedays of Martin Van Buren. The Constitution requires that the vicepresident preside over the ceremony, and as Bush occasionally pointsout, Van Buren was the last vice president to win election directlyto the White House.   Thus he was the last man who presided over the ceremony thatcertified his own triumph _ in 1837.   Bush was greeted by applause when he led a parade of senatorsinto the House chamber for the ceremony. Two pages carried theElectoral College votes cast by the states into the House in twomahogany boxes.   The vice president then mounted the Speaker's rostrum of theHouse chamber for the ceremony. Four lawmakers opened and pronouncedthe Electoral College results from each of the 50 states and theDistrict of Columbia ``regular in form and authentic'' and announedthe results.   If there was no suspense, Bush injected a note of humor. WhenRep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., simply said that Arkansas had cast sixvotes for president, Bush interrupted and said, ``The chair wonderswho won that one.''   Bush did, along with 39 other states and the right to the WhiteHouse.   At the same time Bush savors his presidential election victory,aides say he is close to making the final appointment to hisCabinet, that of energy secretary. James Schlesinger, who served inthe post during the Carter administration, remains the leadingcandidate, according to one Republican source.   Bush also is expected to appoint a drug czar within the next fewdays.   He met privately Tuesday with Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., andthe Arizona Republic reported that DeConcini is a top contender forthat job. DeConcini would not discuss specifics of the meeting.   High-level appointments aside, Bush's trip to the Capitol for theElectoral College ceremony closed the circle on the election of 1988.   Bush was in the Capitol on Tuesday, as well, presiding overswearing-in ceremonies for 33 new and newly re-elected senators. Hetook time out long enough to renew ``loud and clear'' his campaignpledge to oppose higher taxes.   ``It's funny, I've talked to about 33 new senators and not one ofthem has said that to me,'' Bush said when asked if a possible taxncrease had been discussed.   He said of his campaign pledge, ``The American people have heardit loud and clear.''   Despite Bush's comments, many Democrats and some Republicansbelieve he will have to change his mind to win agreement on acomprehensive plan to reduce the federal budget deficit.   Bush performed the senatorial swearing in chores twice, first ina formal ceremony on the Senate floor, administering the oath ofoffice to senators in groups of four. He then did it one by one in ahall where photographers were permitted.   The president-elect jokingly told reporters he was ``going tomake a little news up here for you guys.''   But when he was asked whether he intends to fight a subpoena totestify in the Iran-Contra trial of former White House aide OliverNorth, Bush retorted: ``I don't want to make that much news.''</TEXT></DOC>
