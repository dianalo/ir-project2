This leads to significant rightwardshifts of the HbO{sub 2} dissociation curves with in vitro P{sub 50},values increasing from 32.2 +/- 1.8 torr for control erythrocytes to86 +/- 60 torr. The shape of the dissociation curve was still sigmoidal,although the Hill coefficient was decreased. The life span of InsP{sub6}-loaded erythrocytes equaled that of control erythrocytes. Erythrocyte-survivalstudies were done using {sub 51}Cr labeling of cells. The long-term physiologicaleffects of the InsP{sub 6}-loaded erythrocytes on piglets were increasedO{sub 2} release and reduced cardiac output. The reduced O{sub 2} affinityof the InsP{sub 6}-loaded erythrocytes was still effective 20 days aftertransfusion in awake piglets. The electrolyte concentration appearedstable over the 5-day observation period except for a transient, butsignificant, hyperkalemia immediately after transfusion. The reductionsin the O{sub 2} affinity of Hb reported here are large compared withpreviously reported values. Introduction of InsP{sub 6} into viable erythrocytesimproves tissue oxygenation when, for any reason, normal blood flow isimpaired.</TEXT></DOC>
