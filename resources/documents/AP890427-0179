A permit to conduct the test was approved for MonsantoAgricultural Co., St. Louis, Mo., said James W. Glosser,administrator of the department's Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service.   Glosser said the field testing of both disease-resistantvarieties will begin later this month near Jersey, Ill., and thatone of the varieties also will be tested in Nampa, Idaho.   ``The experimental design of these trials is sound and shouldprovide important scientific data without causing any significantimpact on the environment,'' he said.   Three disease-causing organisms _ leaf roll virus, virus x andvirus y _ infect potato crops, causing yellowing and stunting ofplants, Glosser said. Depending on conditions, the viruses cancause a 5 percent to 10 percent yield loss, or more, as well as adrop in product quality.   The Monsanto potato varieties were developed by taking geneticmaterial from the viruses and inserting it into the potato. Ingreenhouse studies, the company found that the material producedproteins in the potatoes, which protected them from disease.   In a related development, the department's Agricultural ResearchService said the first outdoor test of cotton geneticallyengineered to kill caterpillar pests began on Thursday. The cottonproject was announced two weeks ago.   The new cotton variety is being tested on a one-acre site atMississippi State University, Starkville, Miss.   A gene from a common bacterium, Bacillus thuringienensis, wasinserted into the cotton plant. The gene produces a protein that istoxic to caterpillar-type insects but not to humans.   The cotton was engineered by scientists at Agracetus Inc.,Middleton, Wis. If successful, the new variety could protect itselfagainst such pests as the bollworm, tobacco budworm and armyworm.</TEXT></DOC>
