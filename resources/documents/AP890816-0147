Bruce J. Rice, 42, president of Rice Aircraft Inc. of Hauppauge,N.Y., pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy and two counts ofmail fraud. The company pleaded guilty to one count each ofconspiracy and mail fraud.   Attorneys on both sides emphasized that no aircraft accidentswere known to have occurred because of the parts, consisting ofaltered and falsely certified rivets and other fasteners.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bruce D. Carter called much of theproblem ``historical,'' saying the parts likely would have failed intheir first few months of use if they were going to fail.   But while many of the fasteners have been recovered or accountedfor, many are ``in the stream of commerce; they're gone,'' Cartersaid.   The counterfeit fasteners were distributed from 1977 through1988, mostly in the early 1980s, prosecutors said.   Court documents indicate the reprocessed parts were sold to theU.S. government, the Israeli government, Airbus Industrie, BritishAerospace, Grumman, Sikorsky, Martin Marietta, Boeing Helicopters,Air France, United Airlines, the Brazilian airline Varig, TWA,American Airlines and Pan AM.   Some of the parts were purchased for military aircraft includingthe F-111, the B-1B bomber and F-14 fighters, prosecutors said.   Rice and his company were accused of buying surplus parts fromsuppliers, and then having them secretly stripped and replated orrelubricated at a facility that Rice's customers had not approved.   To make the parts traceable, prosecutors said, certificationdocuments from the original suppliers were simply copied andsubmitted as the paperwork for the reworked fasteners.   ``There's so much trust (in the industry), if somebody gives youa part and it has a trademark on it, you believe that company didthe work,'' Carter said.   The Rice case, which grew out of a tip from an anonymous whistleblower in Rice's company, is the first prosecution produced by aspecial federal task force called Northwest Defense Contracting, orNORDECON.   The task force, made up of the FBI, IRS and several otheragencies, has been investigating criminal practices in the aircraftparts and supply business.   Rice made no comment after entering his pleas. One of hisattorneys, Dan Dubitzky, said Rice ``has never, at any time, doneanything that jeopardizes the safety of the flying public.''   ``After two years of investigation, the government has yet tofind anything, to prove anything ... is unsafe,'' Dubitzky said.   U.S. District Judge Thomas S. Zilly set sentencing for Feb. 16,1990.   Under plea agreements, Rice faces five years in prison, a$250,000 fine, $250,000 in court costs, an additional $250,000 fineat the discretion of the judge and possible restitution of up to $1million. The company could be fined $25,000 on each count and willshare any burden of restitution with Rice.   On Wednesday, the U.S. attorney's office also filed chargesagainst Richard Ohlman, 70, a parts broker from Mission Viejo,Calif., for allegedlly conspiring with Rice and Rice Aircraft to paykickbacks in 1982 to Boeing Surplus personnel. The charge allegesthe cash payments were not reported to the IRS.</TEXT></DOC>
