It initially was reported the three were among officers killedby loyal soldiers during the attempted coup that began Tuesday.   Mengistu did not name the generals he said had committedsuicide, but spoke of them as ``agents of our detractors.''   Mengistu spoke at a rally in downtown Addis Ababa in his firstpublic appearance since announcing on radio and television Thursdaythat the coup had been crushed.   He told the rally, ``Our detractors and their accomplices neverspared a moment to sow confusion and uncertainity by alleging thatwe have failed to achieve immediate results in our endeavors.''   Diplomatic sources said nearly the entire high command,including six rebellious generals, were killed during the attemptto overthrow the government.   They said the revolt was led by generals humiliated by recentdefeats in Ertirea and Tigre provinces in northern Ethiopia wheredifferent guerrilla forces are fighting for autonomy.   The revolt began a few hours after Mengistu left for a visit toEast Germany. He hurried back Wednesday to face the biggest crisisof his 15-year-old Marxist government.   It was reported Tuesday that Maj. Gen. Merid Negussie, the chiefof staff, and Maj. Gen. Amha Desta, the air force commander, werekilled in the revolt.   The diplomatic sources said Friday that loyalist troops killedMaj. Gen. Denissie Bulto, commander of the 2nd Army withheadquarters in Asmara, the capital Eritrea.   The 150,000-strong 2nd Army, with nearly half of the country'sentire armed forces, had been split into rival factions, accordingto the diplomatic sources.   Mengistu and other officers deposed Emperor Haile Selassie onSept. 12, 1974.   Addis Ababa was calm Saturday although tanks and armoredvehicles remained stationed at strategic buildings.
