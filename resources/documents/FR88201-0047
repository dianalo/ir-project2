That documentdescribes the types of substantive actions which the seventeen U.S. oilcompanies participating in the ``Voluntary Agreement and Plan of Actionto Implement the International Energy Program,'' which was adopted in 1976,may take during implementation of emergency international oil sharing asprovided in the Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP). TheIEP emergency oil sharing system, operated by the International EnergyAgency (IEA), can be activated only when the IEA group of countries asa whole or an individual IEA country experiences an oil supply emergencyinvolving at least a seven percent supply shortfall. Section 252 of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act makes available alimited antitrust defense with respect to actions taken by U.S. oil companiesto implement the information and allocation provisions of the IEP, providedthat such actions are described in a voluntary agreement or plan of action.A plan of action is required to be as specific in its description of proposedsubstantive actions as is reasonable in light of known circumstances. The approved ``Second Plan of Action to Implement the International EnergyProgram,'' which appears as an appendix to this notice, is the productof extensive interchanges over a period of years involving representativesof U.S. oil companies participating in the Voluntary Agreement, the IEA'sSecretariat, and staffs of DOE, the Department of Justice, the Departmentof State and the Federal Trade Commission. U.S. oil companies participatingin the Voluntary Agreement considered the Second Plan of Action at a meetingof the IEA's Group of Reporting Companies held at the Department of Stateon July 29, 1987. At the conclusion of that meeting, the IEA Secretariatadvised the U.S. Government that the Group of Reporting Companies favoredproceeding with adoption of this Plan of Action. Public comments then weresolicited on the Plan of Action, and a public hearing was held with respectto it on September 22, 1987. On December 18, 1987, after consulting with the Federal Trade Commission,the Assistant Attorney General (Antitrust) advised the Secretary of Energyof his approval, on behalf of the Attorney General, of the Second Planof Action. On January 26, 1988, the Secretary of Energy thereupon gavehis approval to the Second Plan of Action, which would go into effect onlyif the President finds that an ``international energy supply emergency''exists. DOE also gives notice that the Department of Justice intends to amend theexisting Voluntary Agreement, effective 20 days after the publication ofthis Notice, to incorporate the approved Plan of Action into, and makeconforming technical changes to, the Voluntary Agreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Craig S.

Background</ITAG>Following the oil embargo of 1973, the United States and certain othermembers of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)entered into the Agreement on an International Energy Program (IEP), TIAS8278, which provided for creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA),headquartered in Paris, France, as an autonomous agency of the OECD. TheIEP's main purposes include reducing the Free World oil consuming nations'vulnerability to supply disruptions by encouraging self-sufficiency inoil supplies; avoiding competition for short supplies of available oilduring a disruption through an Emergency Sharing System for equitably allocatingthose supplies among the signatory countries; establishing a comprehensiveinternational information system; and creating a forum for cooperationwith governments and consultation with oil companies. There are now 21IEA member countries, consisting of all OECD members except France, Finlandand Iceland. The IEP provides that the IEA's Emergency Sharing System (ESS)may be activated only when the IEA group of twenty-one member countriesas a whole or an individual IEA country experiences a seven percent orgreater shortfall of available petroleum supplies, measured against a specifiedbase period.The oil companies of the U.S. and the other IEA countries would play avital role in the implementation of the Emergency Sharing System, providingessential information, advising the IEA on supply and logistical matters,and actually effecting international oil allocation. It has been recognizedfrom the outset that the performance of these functions at the behest ofgovernments could expose companies to antitrust and breach of contractrisks under U.S. law. To facilitate U.S. company participation in the IEA,the Congress in 1975 enacted section 252 of the Energy Policy and ConservationAct (EPCA), 42 U.S.C. 6272, which authorizes the development of voluntaryagreements and plans of action to implement the allocation and informationprovisions of the IEP, and makes available a limited antitrust defenseand a breach of contract defense with respect to actions taken to developor carry out voluntary agreements and plans of action.A ``Voluntary Agreement and Plan of Action to Implement the InternationalEnergy Program'' (Voluntary Agreement) was agreed to in 1976 by a numberof U.S. oil companies. <T3>See</T3> 41 FR 13998 (April 1, 1976) and 2 CCH Federal Energy Guidelines,para. 15,845. At the present time the following seventeen companies, whichhave agreed to be IEA Reporting Companies, are participants in the VoluntaryAgreement:<ITAG tagnum="25">Amerada Hess Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Amoco Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">ARCO</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Ashland Oil, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Caltex Petroleum Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Chevron Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">CONOCO, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Exxon Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Mobil Oil Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Occidental Petroleum Corporation</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Phillips Petroleum Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Shell Oil Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">The Standard Oil Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Sun Company, Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Texaco Inc.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Union Pacific Resources Company</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Unocal Corporation</ITAG>Section 6(c)(1) of the Voluntary Agreement provides for the developmentof plans of action elaborating and applying IEA allocation principles andmeasures, and describing the types of substantive actions which may betaken under the plan, in the event that the Emergency Sharing System istriggered by an oil supply emergency. Section 252 of the EPCA, and the existing Voluntary Agreement, contemplatethat the oil companies which participate in the Voluntary Agreement willplay a role in developing plans of action. Before a plan of action canbe made effective, it must be approved by the U.S. Government: EPCA section252(d) requires approval by the Attorney General, after he has consultedwith the Federal Trade Commission, and the Voluntary Agreement itself callsfor approval of plans of action by the Secretary of Energy. The existingVoluntary Agreement contains a plan of action describing company actionswhich may be taken when IEP oil sharing has been triggered. However, theprovisions of that plan of action understandably are very broad and general,since it was adopted in 1976 while the IEP Emergency Sharing System wasin an early stage of development, whereas EPCA section 252(d)(3) requiresthat a plan of action describe the ``types of substantive actions'' whichmay be taken under the plan, and calls for a plan of action ``as specificin its description of proposed substantive actions as is reasonable inlight of known circumstances.'' For that reason, efforts have been underway for a period of years to prepare a new draft plan of action settingout in much more precise detail those activities in which industry wouldengage while implementing IEP emergency oil sharing, and to which the limitedantitrust and breach of contract defenses would apply.The oil company participants in the Voluntary Agreement several years agoindicated their desire that the Executive Branch take the lead in draftinga new plan of action. Accordingly, staff of DOE, in cooperation with staffof the Departments of Justice and State and the Federal Trade Commission,initially performed this function, preparing draft texts for considerationby the participating companies; the first two such drafts were publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on May 8, 1981 (46 FR 26026), and October 28,1983 (48 FR 49906), respectively, to solicit public comments. subsequently,the companies elected to play a greater role in drafting the proposed planof action, and the Plan of Action which has been adopted is the productof an extensive interchange at meetings of Subcommittee C of the IEA'sIndustry Advisory Board (IAB) involving representatives of U.S. ReportingCompanies, the IEA's Secretariat, and staffs of the concerned U.S. Governmentagencies.The Plan of Action was essentially finalized at a meeting of SubcommitteeC held in White Plains, New York, on April 2, 1987, and a subsequent meetingof the IAB in Paris on June 9, 1987. The final draft of the Plan of Actionwas considered by U.S. Voluntary Agreement participants at a meeting ofthe IEA Group of Reporting Companies at the Department of State on July29, 1987. At that meeting some concerns were voiced that the Plan of Actionwas less flexible than might be desired in order to facilitate oil companyimplementation; in particular, the recordmaking and recordkeeping provisionswere perceived as burdensome, and questions were raised as to the operationaleffects of omitting Plan of Action coverage for so-called ``Type 1 activities''(discussed below). Nonetheless, at the conclusion of the meeting the IEASecretariat advised the Department of Energy that, on balance, the Groupof Reporting Companies favored proceeding with adoption of this Plan ofAction.Following the meeting, DOE published a copy of the draft Second Plan ofAction in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> along with a solicitation of public commentsand an announcement of a public hearing (<T3>see </T3>52 FR Part II, August 21, 1987). The public hearing was heldat DOE on September 22, 1987. The public comments submitted in writingor made at the hearing are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of the Plan of Action</ITAG>Section 6(a) of the existing Voluntary Agreement authorizes the participatingoil companies, during an ``international energy supply emergency,'' to``take such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to implement emergencyallocation programs of the IEA,'' including certain specified actions.The new Plan of Action, which appears below at Appendix 1, replaces paragraph(B) of section 6(a), which specifies as one type of action the participatingcompanies are authorized to engage in, ``Arrangements among the participantsfor the purchase, loan, sale, or exchange of petroleum by and among themselves,or with other persons or entities.''Because of the length and complexity of the Plan of Action, it is beingplaced in an appendix (Appendix B) to the Voluntary Agreement, and incorporatedby reference into the Voluntary Agreement. All of the remaining provisionsof the Voluntary Agreement will apply to the Plan of Action as though itsfull text physically were within the Voluntary Agreement, including theVoluntary Agreement's Section 6 provisions for carrying out the Plan ofAction only following a Presidential determination that there exists an``international energy supply emergency.''The Plan of Action consists of ten sections and two annexes; in additionto the Plan of Action <T3>per se, </T3>there are several implementing amendments to the VoluntaryAgreement. Much of the Plan of Action is devoted to describing the IEAEmergency Sharing System which the participating oil companies would helpcarry out, in the event that the Sharing System were activated during anemergency; certain other provisions deal with administrative arrangements.There are three key sections of the Plan of Action. In terms of conveyinglegal protection to the companies for their participation in the IEA EmergencySharing System, the most significant provisions are in section 5, ``Specificationof Substantive Actions,'' and section 6, ``Confidential or ProprietaryInformation Which May Be Communicated by or to Voluntary Agreement Participantsand Their Employees,'' each as limited by a provision in section 2.2 whichexcludes from the Plan of Action all so-called ``Type 1 activities'' (explainedbelow). The third key section is section 8, ``Requirements for Recordkeeping,Reporting and Monitoring.''1. Coverage of the Plan of ActionSection 252(f) of the EPCA makes available a limited defense to a legalaction brought under the antitrust laws, in respect to actions taken tocarry out a properly approved plan of action, unless such actions to carryout the plan of action were taken ``for the purpose of injuring competition.''\1\<NOTE/> However, this defense is available ``only if the person assertingthe defense demonstrates that the actions were specified in, or withinthe reasonable contemplation of, an approved plan of action.'' And as notedabove, section 252(d)(3) conditions the Government's approval of any planof action on its describing with specificity the substantive actions whichmay be taken under it. The function of section 5, therefore, is to specifythe substantive actions which may be taken under the Plan of Action byparticipating U.S. Reporting Companies and those of their affiliates whichparticipate in the Voluntary Agreement, inclusive of activities undertakenthrough the IAB or in the Industry Supply Advisory Group (ISAG), whichis comprised of industry technical experts who would advise the IEA Secretariatin Paris on oil allocation during an emergency.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\The contract breach defense under section 252(j) applieswhere the breach was caused ``predominantly by action * * * to carry out''a plan of action.The function of section 6 is to specify what types of confidential or proprietaryinformation or data may be communicated, either in writing or orally, whenthe Voluntary Agreement participants take substantive actions that arecovered by the Plan of Action. This section is based on similar provisionsthat have been used in U.S. Government approval letters for IEA AllocationSystems Tests. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> 50 FR 41383 (October 10, 1985).2. Exclusions From the Plan of ActionThe coverage provided by sections 5 and 6 is, however, subject to certainexpress exclusions. A question which has received considerable attentionin the development of the new Plan of Action is whether there should beantitrust protection for the communication by participating U.S. oil companiesto the IEA's Emergency Management Organization (EMO), consisting of theISAG and the Secretariat, of transactional oil price information. Section5.5 specifically excludes such oil price communications from the Plan ofAction, with certain very narrow exceptions for special functions of theIEA Secretariat. In addition, section 6.15 excludes from Plan of Actioncoverage, the communication of confidential or proprietary informationor data concerning company oil costs, market shares, or long-term programsfor investment, divestment, refining, operating, transportation or marketing.Another important exclusion from the Plan of Action, alluded to above,is contained in section 2.2: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of thisPlan of Action, specifically excluded from this Plan of Action are allType 1 activities.'' Simply stated, ``Type 1 activities'' are those oilsupply transactions and related activities which oil companies would undertakevoluntarily and independently of the EMO and of the IEP Emergency SharingSystem procedures for EMO approval of proposed oil transactions (``voluntaryoffers''). ``Type 2 activities,'' in contrast, involve the submission ofproposed ``voluntary offers'' to the EMO for review by the ISAG and IEASecretariat, and Type 2 supply transactions are not to be implemented unlessand until they have been approved by the EMO.\2\<NOTE/> And until the recent adoption of the IEA Governing Boardof a proposal described below, the Emergency Sharing System was structuredso that the ``voluntary offers'' could not be submitted to the EMO by participatingoil companies until roughly mid-way through each monthly allocation cycle,when each IEA member country's exact oil allocation right or allocationobligation under the Sharing System formula would be known.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\There also is a category of ``Type 3 activities,'' involvinggovernment-mandated supply actions, as a last resort if the voluntary systemfails.The question of antitrust and breach of contract protection for Type 1activities has been the most controversial issue raised during preparationof the Plan of Action. The issue gained prominence during and after theIEA's Second Allocation Systems Test (AST-2) in 1978, as the participatingU.S. oil companies observed in IEA test activities an increasing EMO emphasison the use of Type 1 transactions within the IEP Emergency Sharing System,and in that connection on the role of the IEA secretariat and the ISAGin exhorting Reporting Companies to redirect oil to countries thought likelyto have rights to receive it under the IEP Sharing System's formula. Overtime, the U.S. Reporting Companies became more worried that efforts ofthe Secretariat or the ISAG to influence their Type 1 transactions couldexpose the companies to antritrust risks like those arising from theirType 2 transactions, which it is generally recognized need antitrust protection.Because the IEP Emergency Sharing System depends upon the voluntary participationof oil companies, which was being thrown into doubt by Type 1 legal risks,in 1984 the Department of Energy, with the concurrence of the Departmentof Justice, began to explore with the IEA Secretariat and the U.S. ReportingCompanies whether it was possible to develop some selective form of Type1 coverage; that is, whether a narrowly constructed, carefully monitoredType 1 coverage could be developed in the Plan of Action which would allaythe concerns of the companies and facilitate the operation of the SharingSystem, without overextending antitrust and breach of contract protectionsto normal commercial transactions that might have occurred without regardto IEA oil allocation.In 1985, however, while these efforts were under way, apprehension developedon the part of the General Accounting Office and in the Congress that overlybroad Type 1 Plan of Action coverage might ultimately be allowed. As aresult, in the course of enacting legislation to extend the EPCA, the Congressadded a new subsection (m) to section 252. Under this provision, any Planof Action which made the section 252 defenses available to Type 1 activitieswould have to be submitted to Congress under a prescribed Congressionalreview procedure, in order for the Type 1 coverage to be valid. PublicLaw No. 99-58, Section 105 (July 2, 1985).Although consideration of proposals for Type 1 coverage in the Plan ofAction subsequently resumed, what now has made possible the completionof a Plan of Action which excludes Type 1 coverage, is a significant innovationin the IEP Emergency Sharing System with respect to <T3>Type 2 </T3>activities. On November 6, 1986, the IEA Governing Boardadopted a proposal of the IEA Secretariat which was designed to enhancethe operational effectiviness of the IEP Emergency Sharing System, andwhich had corollary benefits for the potential development of a Plan ofAction satisfactory to the U.S. Government, The IEA Secretariat, and theU.S. oil companies participating in the Voluntary Agreement.The operational problem with which the proposal was meant to deal, wasthat the current oil allocation system as well as the Voluntary offer procedurewere established more than ten years previous, at a time when a relativelysmall number of large, integrated oil companies accounted for a greatershare of the world oil market than today and when long-haul crude oilstraded via long-term contracts were still the main element in the markets.At that time, it was believed that decisions to eliminate or reduce supplyimbalances among IEA member countries through redirection of floating crudeoil cargoes could be made without undue haste in view of the long travellingtimes and the small number of main players. But the increased importancesince then of short-haul oil cargoes and of spot crude oil and refinedproduct transactions has changed this situation, and now necessitates afaster responding decision process. Furthermore, technical improvements(<T3>e.g., </T3>current computing capabilities) permit a more flexible EMOoperating approach than was considered possible then years before.The Secretariat's proposal, known as the ``Wider Window'' concept, dealtexclusively with the so-called ``closed-loop'' form of Type 2 voluntaryoffers_<T3>i.e., </T3>with proposed international supply transactions that alreadyhave been worked out with a prospective trading partner, either withinthe same international oil company or with an independent company. Thisis in contradistinction to an ``open-loop'' type of voluntary offer, whichis a firm's proposal to either supply oil to or receive oil from a companyin another country, without predesignation of a trading partner, so thatits offer may be matched up with a proposed trading partner by the EMO.Under the ``Wider Window'' proposal, as adopted by the Governing Board,``closed-loop voluntary offers'' could be submitted to the ISAG or theIEA Secretariat at any time during an allocation cycle, not just at specifiedtimes, as in the case of ``open-loop'' voluntary offers. Moreover, theSecretariat and the ISAG, on an expedited basis (within a period of nomore than 48 hours after receipt of the ``closed-loop'' voluntary offer),are to process each proposed Type 2 transaction and notify the proposingcompany or companies of the EMO's approval, disapproval, or determinationthat there is insufficient information to act upon a voluntary offer.In adopting the IEA Secretariat's proposal, the IEA Governing Board requestedthe Secretariat to prepare draft implementing amendment to the IEA EmergencyManagement Manual (EMM), an IEA-classified document which condifies GoverningBoard decisions on the operation of the IEP Emergency Sharing System. Inthe interim, the Governing Board agreed to apply these Emergency SharingSystem modifications on a provisional basis, in order to enable the U.S.Government to proceed with a Plan of Action which takes them into account.The approved Second Plan of Action which appears below reflects the IEA'sadoption of the ``Wider Window'' concept. By allowing Type 2 activitiesto occur at any time during a monthly allocation cycle, it gives the participatingcompanies a means to avoid the antitrust risks previously associated withType 1 activities.3. Recordkeeping, Reporting and MonitoringIn order to enjoy the benefits of the legal defenses contained in section252, a participating oil company must comply with the conditions of thisPlan of Action applicable to it. Section 8 of the Plan of Action, ``Requirementsfor Recordkeeping, Reporting and Monitoring,'' imposes such conditions.It is basically through this section that there is to be established andmaintained the ``full and complete record of any meeting held,'' and of``any communication (other than in a meeting) made, between or among participantsor potential participants,'' which is required by EPCA section 252(c)(3),and by regulations of the Departments of Energy and Justice at 10 CFR Part209 and 28 CFR Part 56, respectively.Provisions for recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring have been includedin the U.S. Government's approval letters for each of the IEA's five AllocationSystems Tests (ASTs). <T3>See e.g.,</T3> 50 FR 41383 (October 10, 1985). These AST approval letters,which gradually have been improved and clarified over the years, were usedas a starting point in the preparation of Section 8. As Section 8 was developed,all parties concerned were conscious of the desirability of simplifyingand clarifying its provisions, and of removing burdens on industry to themaximum extent possible consistent with the Government's antitrust responsibilties.Extensive drafting effforts repeatedly have been made toward that end.Nonetheless, it is recognized that the recordkeeping provisions of thePlan of Action are complex. While most of the issues raised by these requirementsalready have been the subject of substantial discussion, the Governmentwill remain receptive to any suggestions for lightening or simplifyingthem in a manner consistent with the Government's responsibilities underthe EPCA and the antitrust laws. It should be noted that the provisionsat Annex I to the Second Plan of Action, for the disposition and retentionof ``computer documents'', are of more recent origin and are consideredto be tentative in nature. As the Annex explains, it is intended that theseprovisions be tested in the IEA's next simulated exercise of the IEA'sEmergency Sharing System, AST-6, presently scheduled for late 1988, inorder to evaluate whether companies are capable of complying with theserequirements without undue burden.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Public Comments of the Plan of Action</ITAG>In response to the August 21, 1987, <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, written comments were submitted by SunCompany, Inc., the Petrochemical Energy Group and the Petroleum MarketersAssociation of America. The Petrochemical Energy Group also presented itscomments in an oral statement at the public hearing on the Second Planof Action on September 2, 1987. The following is a discussion of thesecomments.Sun Company, Inc., the only IEA Reporting Company and U.S. Voluntary Agreementparticipant which submitted comments, criticized the Plan of Action's recordkeepingand reporting requirements as excessive, and contended that the burdensomenessof these requirements could make the Plan unworkable in an emergency.As noted above, when the recordkeeping provisions were developed, intensiveefforts were made to simplify and clarify them, and to remove burdens onindustry to the maximum extent possible consistent with the Government'santitrust responsibilities under section 252 of the EPCA. Admittedly, therewere limits beyond which these efforts could not be carried without sacrificingrequirements imposed by law or which the antitrust authorities consideredimportant to the fulfillment of their mission.It is regrettable but perhaps inevitable that the Government's statutoryand programmatic antitrust responsibilities result in Plan of Action reportingand recordkeeping responsibilities more extensive than industry considersnecessary. However, some of the complexities of Article 8 of the Plan ofAction stem directly from initiatives of oil industry counsel to addressspecial problems, such as those of foreign affiliates of Reporting Companieswhich are covered under the Voluntary Agreement and Plan of Action. Inany event, all of the particulars of Article 8 have been subject to lengthyand exhaustive discussion between the Government and industry, and notwithstandingthe Government's disposition of the various issues presented, the IEA'sGroup of Reporting Companies has indicated that it favors proceeding withthe adoption of this Plan of Action.The Petroleum Energy Group (PEG), consisting of seven independent petrochemicalcompanies,\3\<NOTE/> criticized the Plan of Action for its failure to provideany participatory or advisory role for the independent petrochemical industry,and recommended that the Second Plan of Action be modified to provide forthe participation of petrochemical companies in the IEA's Industry AdvisoryBoard (IAB) and Industry Supply Advisory Group (ISAG) which, PEG stated,were ``established'' by the Plan of Action. According to PEG, its membershave substantial interest in decisions made to allocate world oil suppliesbecause of their dependence upon domestic and imported petroleum both asa feedstock and as a source of fuel for manufacturing; in addition, a numberof the U.S. oil companies participating in the IEA are competitors as wellas supplies of PEG members. Consequently, PEG contented that its membersshould be eligible to participate in the IAB and ISAG, along with the U.S.and foreign oil companies, in advising the U.S. Government and the IEAon IEA oil allocation.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\Borg-Warner Chemicals, Inc., Dow Chemical U.S.A., The GoodyearTire andamp; Rubber Co., Hercules Incorporated, Rohm and Haas Company, TexasEastman Company, and Union Carbide Corporation.PEG was incorrect in stating that the IAB and the ISAG were establishedby the Plan of Action and that they serve as advisory bodies to the U.S.Government. Both groups were established by the IEA Governing Board asindustry advisory bodies to the IEA. Both are comprised of representativesof U.S. and foreign oil companies operating in IEA member countries whichhave consented to be designated by the IEA as IEA ``Reporting Companies.''It is possible, however, that some of PEG's members are in fact eligibleto become Reporting Companies, and then to apply for participation in theU.S. Voluntary Agreement and Plan of Action. To become a participant ineither the IAB or the ISAG, a PEG member first would have to request thatthe IEA designate it as a Reporting Company. Under the IEP, Reporting Companystatus is accorded only to ``oil companies'' which ``play a significantrole in the international oil industry,'' but ``oil companies'' is definedsufficiently broadly that some petrochemical firms may fit the definition.In deciding whether to designate a firm as a Reporting Company, the IEAconsiders what contribution that firm could make to the operation of theIEP Emergency Sharing System. If so designated, a PEG member then couldrequest membership in the IAB and/or the ISAG. Once designated an IEA ReportingCompany, a PEG member could participate in the Voluntary Agreement andin the Plan of Action, if its participation were recommended by the Secretaryof Energy and approved by the Attorney General. The Department of Energyhas encouraged PEG to pursue among its members who may qualify, the questionof their becoming IEA Reporting Companies and U.S. Voluntary Agreementparticipants.Admittedly, not all U.S. petrochemical firms will qualify as ReportingCompanies. It is the responsibility of the DOE, as the U.S. ``NationalEmergency Sharing Organization,'' to see to it that Non-Reporting Companiesare kept apprised of and involved in IEA activities during an emergency.The comments of the Petroleum Marketers Association of America (PMAA),a federation of 41 state and regional associations representing approximately11,000 independent petroleum marketers across the United States, expressedgeneral approval of the Second Plan of Action. In particular, PMAA supportedthe exclusion, from the Plan of Action's antitrust portection, of the communicationby U.S. oil companies of transactional oil price information to the IEA,because of the possibility of misuse of such data. PMAA also agreed withthe Plan of Action's recordkeeping requirements, commenting that comprehensiverecordkeeping requirements are an essential condition of the antitrustprotection available under the Plan of Action. Finally, PMAA supportedthe decision to exclude Type 1 activities from the Plan of Action's coverage.However, PMAA expressed concern that ``closed-loop'' Type 2 transactionssubmitted under the recently adopted ``Wider Window'' modification to theIEA`s Emergency Sharing System (which PMAA's comments inaccurately characterizeas ``Type 1'' activity) might not receive the same degree of antitrustscrutiny from the U.S. Government antitrust monitors as ``open-loop'' Type2 transactions, in light of the fact that the IEA is not involved in thematching up of supplying and receiving companies in closed-loop transactions,and because of the fast-track IEA review that will be accorded such transactions.PMAA is even more concerned that the contract breach defense which is providedby EPCA section 252(j) to actions taken under the Plan of Action, mightenable suppliers of refined products to renege on their supply commitments,in order to obtain a higher price.The U.S. Government agencies charged with antitrust monitoring of U.S.company participation in the IEA's Emergency Sharing System are responsiblefor subjecting both ``open-loop'' and ``closed-loop'' Type 2 transactionsto scrutiny. In addition, the IEA's review procedures for ``closed-loop''transactions under the ``Wider Window'' modification to the Emergency SharingSystem include a special category, in which the Secretariat may declineeither to approve or to disapprove a proposed transaction if there is insufficientinformaton available about the effects of the transaction; in that event,no legal protection would attach to the transaction under U.S. law.The question of potential misuse of the contract breach defense was addressedexhaustively in an August 1, 1985, DOE staff response to a General AccountingOffice (GAO) report. The Department's response was especially concernedwith utilization of the contract breach defense in <T3>Type 1 </T3>transactions, since that was the subject discussed in theGAO's report. However, the analysis contained at pages 14-26 of the Department'sresponse is equally applicable to contract breach defenses against lawsuitsbased on <T3>Type 2</T3> IEA transactions.With respect to supplies of refined petroleum products (the chief concernof PMAA), the Department's August 1, 1985, paper pointed out several reasonswhy the Plan of Action's coverage for IEA transactions should not meaningfullyincrease the contract breach risks of PMAA's members during an oil supplyemergency. Where term supply contracts for product remain in use today,they generally stipulate that prices will fluctuate with the market, therebyreducing the supplier's incentive to renege on commitments in order toobtain a higher price. These supply contracts typically include variouskinds of <T3>force majeure</T3> clauses to excuse the supplier from his commitmentsin specified circumstances such as those associated with emergencies. Butunder U.S. law there are significant legal constraints on a supplier'sfreedom of action: even where a valid excuse for contractual nonperformanceis recognized in U.S. courts, the seller has a legal duty to deal fairlyand act in good faith to meet his contractual obligations to the extentpracticable, and absent an express contractual provision to the contrary,this may be held to entail an obligation to allocate his supplies equitably.The applicability of the EPCA section 252(j) breach of contract defenseto certain transactions covered by the Second Plan of Action should noteliminate these legal constraints. Moreover, under section 252(j) thisdefense is available only if the supplier can prove that a contract breachwas caused ``predominantly'' by his efforts to carry out the Plan of Action,which even further limits any potential for misuse of this defense.Copies of the August 1, 1985, legal analysis will be made available byDOE upon request.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. U.S. Government Approval of the Plan of Action</ITAG>Section 6(c)(1) of the existing Voluntary Agreement requires that the Secretaryof Energy approve a plan of action, before it may be carried out. In adddition,section 252(d) of the EPCA provides that before a plan of action can bemade effective, it must be approved by the Attorney General, after consultationwith the Federal Trade Commisison, which is required to publish in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> its views as to whether the plan of action shouldbe approved.In accordance with these procedures, on October 14, 1987, the Secretaryof Energy submitted the proposed Second Plan of Action to the AttorneyGeneral for his approval, and to the Federal Trade Commission and the Secretaryof State for their comments. By letter dated November 13, 1987, the Secretaryof State recommended that the Attorney General and the Secretary of Energyapproved the Second Plan of Action. On December 18, 1987, after consultingwith the Federal Trade Commission, the Assistant Attorney General (Antitrust)advised the Secretary of Energy of his approval, on behalf of the AttorneyGeneral, of the Second Plan of Action. The Secretary of Energy thereupon,on January 26, 1988, gave his approval to the Second Plan of Action. Thecorrespondence among DOE, the Departments of Justice and State and theFederal Trade Commission concerning the approval of the Second Plan ofAction appears below at Appendix 3. The Federal Trade Commission publishedthe text of its letter to the Department of Justice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 17, 1987 (52 FR 47974).The Department of Energy also has received from the Department of Justice,notice of the latter's approval, pursuant to its authority under section252(d)(1) of the EPCA and section 11(b) of the existing Voluntary Agreement,of necessary implementing amendments to the Voluntary Agreement. The textof these amendments is set forth below in Appendix 2. The first amendmentwould revise section 6(a)(1)(B) of the Voluntary Agreement to incorporatethe Second Plan of Action as Appendix B to the Voluntary Agreement. Thesecond modification would revise section (6)(e)(1) to clarify that whenthe Second Plan of Action is in effect, following a Presidential findingof an international energy supply interruption, the Plan of Action's provisionsfor oil company recordkeeping and reporting to the U.S. Government wouldapply in lieu of the reporting requirement in section 6(e)(1). The finalamendment would modify section 9(b)(3) to permit a Voluntary Agreementsignatory to designate for Voluntary Agreement coverage, in addition toany subsidiary which is more than fifty percent owned by the signatory,any company which owns fifty percent of the signatory (that is, its parentcompany), and any company which is more than fifty percent owned by thesame parent company (that is, a sister company).As indicated by the correspondence in Appendix 3, prior consultation withthe Federal Trade Commission and the Department of State concerning theseamendments has taken place, as required by section 252(d)(1) of the EPCA.The Department of Justice's December 18, 1987, letter authorizes DOE, onbehalf of the Justice Department, to give notice to the Voluntary Agreementparticipants, as required by section 11(b) of the Voluntary Agreement,that the Department of Justice intends to adopt the implementing amendmentsto the Voluntary Agreement effective twenty days after the date of this<T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Therefore, this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice constitutes the notice to Voluntary Agreementparticipants which the Department of Justice is required to provide pursuantto section 11(b) of the Voluntary Agreement.As indicated above, section 252(m)(1) of the EPCA, added in 1985, provideswith respect to a new plan of action that only after the Congressionalreview prescribed in that subsection shall the section 252 antitrust andbreach of contract defenses be applicable to Type 1 activities. Even thoughthe approved Second Plan of Action which we publish today at Appendix 1to this notice does not provide for the so-called ``Type 1'' coverage whichas a legal matter would necessitate submission to Congress, under prescribedprocedures for Congressional review, DOE nonetheless intends to transmita copy of the Plan of Action to Congress.The ``Second Plan of Action to Implement the International Energy Program''would go into effect only if the President finds that an ``internationalenergy supply emergency'' exists. EPCA section 252(k)(1) defines this termas meaning a period when the President determines that oil allocation toIEA countries is required by the IEP.<ITAG tagnum="21">Issued in Washington, DC, January 28, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Eric J.

Actions taken to carry out this plan of Action are entitledto the antitrust defense accorded under section 252(f) of EPCA providedthat the person taking them has complied with the applicable requirementsof section 252 of EPCA, the regulations implementing section 252 of EPCA,the Voluntary Agreement, and the conditions of this Plan of Action applicableto such person. 2.2 <T3>Exclusion.</T3> Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan ofAction, specifically excluded from this plan of Action are all Type 1 activities.<ITAG tagnum="81">3.0 </ITAG><T3>Description of Entities Involved. </T3>This section describes the entities presently expected to participate inIEA oil allocation during an international energy supply emergency. 3.1 The Standing Group on Emergency Questions (``SEQ''), composed of representativesof IEA countries, carries out functions assigned to it in the IEP, andany other function delegated to it by the IEA Governing Board. The SEQEmergency Group (``SEQ-EG'') is an IEA body reporting to the IEA GoverningBoard, composed of representatives from each IEA country, which is convenedduring the period of IEA oil allocation. The SEQ-EG is responsible forensuring intergovernmental agreement or consensus as regards decisionstaken in implementation of the IEP during an emergency; it also is responsiblefor maintaining communications between the IEA and IEA countries on mattersof emergency policy or problems. 3.2 The Allocation Coordinator is the Executive Director of the IEA. TheAllocation Coordinator is assisted by a small team and may designate oneor more members of this team to act on his behalf on particular matters.The Allocation Coordinator and his team wil be responsible to the SEQ-EGfor the supervision and direction of IEA oil allocation. This responsibilitywill include reviewing and approving proposed allocation actions, coordinatingwith the SEQ-EG on policy guidance and on problems, and ensuring that theimplementation of allocation is consistent with the principles and objectivesof the IEP and the EMM. The Allocation Coordinator is responsible for approvingfor implementation those voluntary offers he deems most suitable in thecircumstances. 3.3 The IEA Secretariat, consisting of the Executive Director and the staff,will be organized as appropriate to deal with various aspects of IEA oilallocation. 3.4 NESOs are governmental organizations in each IEA country which willbe responsible for national oil reallocation, other national energy emergencymeasures, and liaison with the IEA on matters of international oil allocationin an emergency. They may at times include oil company personnel. 3.5 The Industry Supply Advisory Group (``ISAG'') is an <T3>ad hoc</T3> group of the Industry Advisory Board made up of employeesof Reporting Companies or their affiliates (including Voluntary Agreementparticipants), which is responsible to the IEA. The ISAG will serve asan advisory group to the Allocation Coordinator during IEA oil allocation.It is composed of oil company supply, logistics, maritime and other expertsand includes an ISAG Manager, a Deputy Manager and the heads and membersof the following subgroups: (A) The Supply Coordination Group, each of whose members is assigned tocommunicate with and process the material received from a specified numberof Reporting Companies. A Supply Coordination Group member will not serveas liaison with his own Voluntary Agreement participant employer unlessthe Allocation Coordinator determines otherwise for reasons of efficiency.             (B) The Country Supply Group, each of whose members is assigned, togetherwith a member of one of the Secretariat's task forces, to communicate withand process the material received from a specified number of IEA countryNESOs.(C) The Supply Analysis Group, which assists the analytical efforts ofthe Supply Coordination Group and the Country Supply Group as assigned,and is responsible for all other ISAG analytical work on supply reallocationproblems or potential problems identified in the course of supply emergency.3.6 The Reporting Companies are a group of oil companies which have consentedto be so designated by the IEA, including all oil companies whose participationin the Voluntary Agreement has been approved pursuant to section 9(b)(1)thereof (but excluding their affiliates). During each monthly cycle theReporting Companies are responsible for the submission of appropriate QuestionnairesA to the IEA Secretariat, and they carry out Type 1, Type 2 and Type 3activities.3.7 The Non-Reporting Companies are firms which are not Voluntary Agreementparticipants or other Reporting Companies, or affiliates thereof, whichmay submit data comparable to that reported on Questionnaire A, and maymake voluntary offers to redirect petroleum supplies. These submissionsand offers are made to NESOs but not to the IEA Secretariat directly.3.8 The Industry Advisory Board together with its subcommittees (``IAB''),whose members are drawn from the group of Reporting Companies, has beenestablished by the IEA to provide advice and consultation on emergencyoil sharing and related questions. When IEA oil allocation is activatedthe IAB may be consulted on specific oil sharing and related questionsby the Allocation Coordinator and his team and by the ISAG, as describedin section 4.9. It also may be consulted from time to time by the ISAGManager on ISAG organizational, administrative and personnel matters.<ITAG tagnum="81">4.0 </ITAG><T3>Description of IEA Oil Allocation.</T3>IEA oil allocation generally is governed by a cycle of scheduled activitiesset by the Allocation Coordinator, based principally upon the calculationof IEA countries' allocation rights and allocation obligations monthlyor at changed intervals as necessary. While normal commercial activitiesof the Reporting Companies and Non-Reporting Companies, both within countriesand in international trading, will go forward and change throughout theallocation cycle in response to changing circumstances, the actions ofReporting Companies and of the ISAG which are described in this Plan ofAction are guided by this cycle as to both timing and type of activityundertaken. Unless circumstances require modification by the AllocationCoordinator, the timetable governing operations typically would be in accordancewith sections 4.1 through 4.10. However, in the case of IEA oil allocationcarried out pursuant to Article 17 of the IEP (a ``selective trigger''),the SEQ-EG would be convened to discuss with the Allocation Coordinator,in consultation with the IAB, the most suitable means to fulfill IEA countries'allocation rights and allocation obligations and in this context whethera partial or full application of the general procedures for allocationimplementation is required; thus some modifications in the activities describedin this Plan of Action may be necessary in connection with a selectivetrigger.4.1 As soon as a trigger finding to activate IEA oil allocation has beenmade, the IEA Secretariat or the ISAG or both will notify Reporting Companiesof the finding and of the need to consider rearranging supply programs.The IEA Secretariat or the ISAG also may provide preliminary calculationsof IEA countries' supply rights and advice as to the general directionof reallocation likely to be required. Based on this information, the ReportingCompanies, their affiliates, and Non-Reporting Companies will ascertainwhether their supplies can be reallocated in order to assist in the reallocationprocess, through ``closed-loop'' voluntary offers (<T3>i.e., </T3>proposed transactions with affiliates or with other oilcompanies or NESOs) to divert quantities of oil from a specified countryto another specified country. Commencing with the finding, and possiblyprior to the submission and processing of Questionnaires A and B describedin section 4.2 and 4.3, and continuing throughout each allocation cycle,Reporting Companies and Non-Reporting Companies, on their own initiativeor upon the request of the Emergency Management Organization, may submitto the IEA Secretariat or to the ISAG ``closed-loop'' voluntary offers.The IEA Secretariat or the ISAG, on an expedited basis (within a periodof no more than forty-eight hours after receipt of the offer), will process``closed-loop'' voluntary offers as described in Sections 4.6 and 4.7,and the IEA Secretariat or the ISAG will notify the appropriate ReportingCompanies and NESOs of the Allocation Coordinator's approval or disapproval,or determination of insufficient information to act upon, such voluntaryoffers.4.2 Reporting Companies will submit Questionnaires A to the IEA Secretariatafter the beginning of each allocation cycle; Questionnaire A submissionsmay be made before the trigger finding upon the request of the ExecutiveDirector of the IEA and, in the case of a Voluntary Agreement participant,pursuant to approval under section 5 of the Voluntary Agreement. At thesame time, they or their affiliates in IEA countries will submit to theirNESOs or other government agencies similar information or data on operationsin those countries. These data will be incorporated, along with aggregateinformation with respect to domestic Non-Reporting Companies, in QuestionnairesB which will be submitted to the IEA Secretariat by IEA countries.4.3 The ISAG, but mainly the Supply Coordination Group, with its counterpartsfrom the IEA Secretariat, will analyze Questionnaires A for errors, andISAG, but mainly the Country Supply Group, with its counterparts from theIEA Secretariat, will do the same with Questionnaires B. Possible errorsin the questionnaires, as well as discrepancies between QuestionnairesA and B, then will be discussed with the appropriate Reporting Companiesand NESOs.4.4 The questionnaire data will be processed by the IEA Secretariat toobtain the supply right, and the allocation right or allocation obligation,of each IEA country for the allocation cycle, taking into account adjustmentsprovided for in the EMM. The resulting allocation rights and allocationobligations together with the total supplies of crude oils and crude oilequivalents, by country of origin, for each IEA country are available tothe Allocation Coordinator, the IEA Secretariat, the SEQ-EG and the ISAG,and are transmitted to NESOs and Reporting Companies and through NESOsto Non-Reporting Companies. The ISAG or the IEA Secretariat or both alsomay provide to Reporting Companies and NESOs, preliminary indications ofthe effect of the supply disruption on individual IEA countries, and othergeneral comments and calculations as to the general type and directionof voluntary offers needed to balance allocation rights and allocationobligations.4.5 Based on the information or data received from the ISAG or the IEASecretariat as described in sections 4.1 and 4.4, each Reporting Company,each of its affiliates, and each Non-Reporting Company may ascertain whetherits supplies can be reallocated or further reallocated in order to assistin balancing allocation rights and allocation obligations. Each of themmay further explore with non-affilated companies whether this result canbe accomplished through sale or exchange with those companies. A ReportingCompany may notify the ISAG of its potential voluntarily to meet IEA countries'allocation rights or allocation obligations, and may submit to the ISAGa number of voluntary offers to reallocate supplies. These may be ``open-loop''voluntary offers (``open-supply'' voluntary offers to supply a quantityof petroleum to any destination recommended by ISAG or chosen by the AllocationCoordinator or ``open-receive'' voluntary offers to receive oil from anyavailable source). They also may be additional ``closed-loop'' voluntaryoffers, as described in section 4.1. ISAG may solicit such ``open-loop''voluntary offers and additional ``closed-loop'' voluntary offers, and NESOswill seek to develop such voluntary offers from Non-Reporting Companiesin their jursidiction and submit them to the ISAG.4.6 The ISAG, but mainly the Supply Coordination Group, or the IEA Secretariat,or both, will analyze all of the voluntary offers received from ReportingCompanies, and may contact the Reporting Companies for clarification ofdetails, to suggest possible modifications, or to explore the possibilityof additional voluntary offers. The ISAG and its Country Supply Group andits IEA Secretariat counterparts will do the same for voluntary offersto be submitted by NESOs.4.7 In accordance with criteria set forth in sections 5.3(I) and 5.3(J),ISAG and IEA Secretariat personnel will undertake a balancing of allocationrights and allocation obligations, including a matching of ``open-supply''and ``open-receive'' voluntary offers and a examination of ``closed-loop''voluntary offers for suitability, for the periods covered under the currentallocation cycle, for future allocation cycles where applicable, and tofulfill unsatisfied allocation rights or allocation obligations from priorallocation cycles.4.8 In addition to notifying the appropriate Reporting Companies and NESOsof the Allocation Coordinator's action with respect to ``closed-loop''voluntary offers, as decribed in Section 4.1, ISAG and the IEA Secretariatalso will notify the appropriate Reporting Companies and NESOs of all ``open-loop''voluntary offers matched or approved by the Allocation Coordinator. Thenotified entities will advise whether they are implementing approved ``open-loop''and ``closed-loop'' Type 2 transactions. If appropriate, the ReportingCompanies and NESOs also will confirm whether they have been able to developany additional voluntary offers previously suggested to them by ISAG orthe IEA Secretariat. All these results are to be reported by ISAG to theAllocation Coordinator, who in turn may report the information to the SEQ-EG.4.9 If substantial unfulfilled allocation rights and allocation obligationsremain among IEA countries, the SEQ-EG may request the ISAG and AllocationCoordinator to consult with the IAB, and with others, on ways to elicitfurther voluntary offers to balance these allocation rights and allocationobligations. If the imbalances remain after subsequent efforts by ISAGto implement the advice agreed on by the Allocation Coordinator and theIAB, and cannnot be resolved on a voluntary basis, the Allocation Coordinatorwill not inform the SEQ-EG.4.10 The SEQ-EG then will undertake intergovernmental consultation and,after contacts by the Allocation Coordinator or his team with the ReportingCompanies concerned, will determine whether corrective measures shouldbe taken under the IEP by IEA country governments. As a last resort IEAcountries having jurisdiction over the Reporting Companies and Non-ReportingCompanies may order them to carry out Type 3 activities. <ITAG tagnum="81">5.0 Specification of Substantive Actions. </ITAG>5.1 <T3>Voluntary Agreement Participants. </T3>Except as otherwise providedin this Plan of Action, the following substantive actions of a VoluntaryAgreement participant and its employees are specified in this Plan of Action.(A) Preliminary communications with the Emergency Management Organizationto ensure that communication channels are working and to discuss schedulesfor submission of Questionnaires A and of other information required forIEA oil allocation.

To assist this study of product imbalanceproblems within a country, Voluntary Agreement participant employees servingon the ISAG may receive from the government of that IEA country, or fromthe IEA Secretariat, data on historical supply patterns for that country,including indigenous production, imports of crude and products by countryor origin, exports of crude and products to country of destination, stocksat sea and crude and product inventory profiles. Data or information withrespect to regions of a country may be provided as required.(G) Other analytical work on country or company supply plans as requestedby the Allocation Coordinator, including with respect to such plans, following,analyzing and forecasting shipping tonnage availability and requirements,during the course of an emergency, in addition to communications withinISAG or with outside persons in order to develop necessary informationfor such shipping analyses.(H) Coordination, under the guidance of the Allocation Coordinator, ofthe voluntary offers of Reporting and Non-Reporting Companies, includingindependent efforts to encourage the development of voluntary offers inorder better to direct supplies to meet IEA calculated supply rights. Participationin the ISAG/IEA Secretariat process of balancing allocation rights andallocation obligations of IEA countries for the periods covered in an allocationcycle, or for a future cycle where applicable, including matching available``open-supply'' and ``open-receive'' voluntary offers and examining ``closed-loop''voluntary offers for suitability. (I) The ISAG in consultation with the IEA Secretariat will evaluate thevoluntary offers by Reporting Companies and by NESOs for Non-ReportingCompanies. In making its evaluation and recommendations to the AllocationCoordinator, it may be guided by technical factors including the following,in addition to specific guidance from the Allocation Coordinator: (i) The volumes of petroleum required to balance the allocation rightsand allocation obligations of individual IEA countries; (ii) The petroleum logistics system of each country, including port facilities,storage capacity, and barge/pipeline facilities; (iii) The specifications of the crude oil being delivered in relation tothe refining capability within the country to process that oil; (iv) Product imbalance problems in IEA countries as compared with the supplymix scheduled for these countries; (v) Insofar as possible and consistent with section 5.3(J), maintenanceof normal supply patterns for various IEA countries and normal supply proportionsbetween crude oil and products and among different categories of crudeoil and products; (vi) Minimization of transportation costs, for example, by avoidance tothe greatest possible extent of logistical disadvantages arising from undulylong voyages; and by utilization of backhaul voyages for vessels; and (vii) The need for priorities in considering offers, as among such voluntaryoffers. If, after such an evaluation process, there remain alternative allocationpossibilities for an IEA country or too many voluntary offers so that aselection must be made, such altenatives may be discussed with the relevantNESO and Reporting Companies as well as with the IEA Secretariat for thepurpose of exchanging views on the choices to be made. (J) In evaluating potential alternative actions to balance allocation rightsand allocation obligations, ISAG is not to take into account the economicbenefit or penalty to any Reporting Company or IEA country (but see section5.3(I)(vi)), or the market share of any Reporting or Non-Reporting Companyin any county. National oil reallocation of available supply is solelya matter for decision by each IEA country.

Section 252 also requires thata full and complete record be made of communications, including face-to-facecommunications other than in the context of a meeting. The following sectionsimplement the existing U.S. recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring requirementsin Section 252 of EPCA, 10 CFR Part 209, and 28 CFR Part 56, and applysuch requirements to meetings, communications and other actions to carryout this Plan of Action. In addition, Annex I hereto contains special rulesgoverning disposition and retention of computer documents which apply inlieu of certain specified provisions of this section 8, as indicated atthe appropriate places herein. These requirements apply, <T3>inter alia,</T3> to Voluntary Agreement participants and to their employeesserving on the ISAG who will be participating in the allocation activitiesat the allocation site. These requirements apply to actions of CoveredForeign Affiliates to the extent provided in sections 8.6, 8.7 and 8.8,except under the circumstances described in Annex II hereto, which concernthe prevention of compliance by a foreign law prohibition, in which eventthe alternative requirements specified in Annex II will apply. Questionsconcerning the removal of records from the allocation site are outsideof the scope of the following sections. If experience indicates the need,the U.S. Government observers at the allocation site will have discretionto allow alternative operating procedures and recordkeeping requirementsconsistent with section 252 of EPCA and existing regulations thereunder.8.2 <T3>Definitions.</T3> For purposes of these requirements the followingadditional definitions apply:(A) ``Communication'' and ``document'' exclude:(i) The communication or documentation of administrative, procedural, orministerial information or data such as scheduling of meetings, personnelassignments, arranging for support services, testing of communicationslinks, and merely routine implementation of previously-agreed petroleumsale or exchange transactions (<T3>e.g., </T3>supply and vessel slating, cargo inspection and oil lossreports, insurance, third-party financing, and the like) (but see section8.8(C) (1) and (2));  (ii) Communications or documents which are subject to the attorney-clientor attorney work product privileges (but see section 8.8(C)(3)); and  (iii) Communications with or the documentation of communications with U.S.Government observers at the allocation site.

(D) ``Allocation meeting'' means the following group meetings held at theallocation site (with or without IEA Secretariat participation):  (i) Meetings of the entire ISAG;  (ii) Meetings of the ISAG's Country Supply, Supply Coordination or SupplyAnalysis subgroups; and  (iii) Meetings of the ISAG Manager or Deputy Manager and ISAG subgroupheads.  (E) ``U.S. Voluntary Agreement participant'' means any oil company whoseparticipation in the Voluntary Agreement has been approved pursuant tosection 9(b)(1) of the Voluntary Agreement, and also any affiliate (otherthan a Covered Foreign Affiliate) of that oil company that is covered pursuantto section 9(b)(3) of the Voluntary Agreement.  (F) ``Covered Foreign Affiliate'' means any affiliate of a U.S. VoluntaryAgreement participant that has its principal place of business outsidethe United States, that conducts the substantial majority of its activitiesoutside the United States, and that is covered pursuant to section 9(b)(3)of the Voluntary Agreement. A Covered Foreign Affiliate's ``parent company''means the oil company approved as a Voluntary Agreement participant undersection 9(b)(1) thereof, which has designated the Covered Foreign Affiliatefor coverage under section 9(b)(1) thereof.  (G) ``Affiliate'' means: (i) Any other company that receives VoluntaryAgreement coverage through the approval of the participation of the sameoil company pursuant to section 9(b)(1) of the Voluntary Agreement; and(ii) except as otherwise provided below in this paragraph, any other companythat is eligible to be designated for coverage by the approved oil companypursuant to section 9(b)(3).
