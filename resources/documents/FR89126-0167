The language in these guidelines is general so that it may be broadly appliedin general industry, shipyards, marine terminals, and longshoring activitiesregardless of the size, nature, or complexity of operations. Constructionactivities are not addressed here because they are already covered by SubpartC of the Construction standards, 29 CFR Part 1926. The guidelines consist of program elements which represent a distillationof applied safety and health management practices that are used by employerswho are successful in protecting the safety and health of their employees.These program elements are advocated by many safety and health professionalsand consultants. They were strongly endorsed by individuals, corporations,professional associations, and labor representatives who responded to theOSHA request for comments and information, 53 FR 26790, published on July15, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>January 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>James F.

Background </ITAG>Over their years of experience with enforcing the provisions of the OccupationalSafety and Health Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 651 <T3>et seq</T3>.), OSHA representatives have noted a strong correlationbetween the application of sound management practices in the operationof safety and health programs and a low incidence of occupational injuriesand illnesses. Where effective safety and health management is practiced,injury and illness rates are significantly less than rates at comparableworksites where safety and health management is weak or non-existent. (See,for example, ``DOL Safety Programs Cut Workers Comp Costs,'' <T3>Good News, </T3>Oklahoma Department of Labor, October 5, 1988, p. 1.;and Michael E. Nave, ``Impact of Voluntary Compliance and Compliance InspectionPrograms on Experience Rates among Small Employers in California,'' DoctoralThesis, Oregon State University, 1987.) As a result of this awareness, OSHA increased emphasis on management practicesin several of the Agency's programs. Standards, including notably the HazardCommunication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200), began specifically to requiremanagement programs. An early OSHA standard requiring safety and healthmanagement programs in the construction industry was recently clarifiedand reaffirmed by the issuance of OSHA Instruction STD 3-1.1. OSHA alsoinstituted programs to encourage voluntary improvement of safety and healthmanagement. These included informational pamphlets and consultation servicesto assist in the development of management programs for small businesses.In addition, in 1982 OSHA began to approve worksites with exemplary safetyand health management programs for participation in the Voluntary ProtectionPrograms (VPP). Safety and health practices, procedures, and recordkeepingat participating worksites have been carefully evaluated and monitoredby OSHA. These VPP worksites generally have lost-workday case rates thatrange from one-fifth to one-third the rates experienced by average worksites(Unpublished statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, 1988). Further, most participating sites report improved employee morale and productivityas a by-product of their safety and health management activities. Based upon the success of VPP and positive experience with other safetyand health program initiatives and in order to broaden the informationavailable to OSHA from other sources, OSHA published a request for commentsand information on July 15, 1988, that included possible language for Safetyand Health Program Guidelines which would be applicable to general industry,shipyard, and longshoring activities (53 FR 26790). That request inadvertentlyomitted reference to marine terminals, to which the guidelines are alsointended to apply. In response to several requests, on September 1, 1988, OSHA extended theoriginal six-week comment period for another month, to September 28, 1988(53 FR 33823). In addition, on September 8, 1988, OSHA announced a publicinformation-gathering meeting to be held on October 6, 1988, at the OSHATraining Institute in Des Plaines, Illinois (53 FR 34780). OSHA received 54 comments from individuals, labor representatives, tradeassociations, professional safety and health associations and societies,safety and health consultants, and Federal and State agencies. Thirteencommentors presented information and comments at the public meeting.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Public Response</ITAG>In the July 15, 1988, request for information and comment, under the heading,``Issues for Discussion'' (53 FR 26796), OSHA asked questions concerningfive major areas: the nature of the risk from inadequate management; thevalue of safety and health programs; suitable language for safety and healthmanagement guidance; appropriate methods for educating employers; and incentivesfor effective management.There was no new information received concerning either the nature of therisk or the value of safety and health programs, but many commentors expressedthe belief that safety and health program management makes a major impacton loss prevention. During the public meeting, OSHA was informed that theVPP Participants' Association might be able to obtain information concerningcosts and benefits of effective safety and health management through itsmembership (Tr. pp. 75-76).As a means of educating employers, one commentor suggested videotapingmodel safety and health programs to help small businesses (Exh. 3-37).Another commentor advised a major outreach effort using all types of mediato reach employers (Exh. 3-46).Suggested incentives for effective management included tax breaks (Exh.3-33) and incentives similar to those offered by the VPP (Exh. 3-37). Onecommentor suggesting the tax breaks acknowledged that they might be difficultto administer fairly (Exh. 3-36). Another commentor proposed the use ofthe guidelines by compliance officers to determine whether or not to doa partial or comprehensive inspection (Exh. 3-27).Most respondents offered comments and/or suggestions on the subject ofsuitable guidance language. Several, however, also expressed a preferencethat the guidance from OSHA take the form of a mandatory standard ratherthan of voluntary guidelines (Exhs. 3-14, 3-17, 3-22, 3-26, 3-28).Almost all the commentors endorsed the concept that effective safety andhealth management is the decisive factor in ensuring worker safety andhealth (e.g., Exhs. 3-4, 3-23, 3-36, 3-37, 3-45, 3-46). Three-fourths ofthe respondents specifically endorsed the issuance of guidelines. A fewrespondents objected to the proposal because of expected cost, anticipatedimpact on diversity and innovation, or the possibility of confusion resultingfrom the issuance of voluntary guidelines by a regulatory agency (e.g.,Exhs. 3-41, 3-44, 3-50).Most respondents indicated that the guidelines are generally applicableregardless of industry type, size, or nature of activity (e.g., Exhs. 3-28,3-36). Several commentors recommended greater detail and specificity regardingduties, responsibilities, and program guidance (e.g., Exh. 3-29); othersstated that greater specificity would inhibit necessary flexibility (e.g.,Exh. 3-12). Although some proposed reorganization of the guidelines (e.g.,Exhs. 3-7, 3-16, 3-22, 3-31, 3-32), there seemed to be agreement that theguidelines as suggested are generally applicable and complete.Many respondents strongly maintained that the guidelines should specifythat safety and health management goals and operational activities shouldbe set forth in writing, regardless of how small the business may be (Exhs.3-30, 3-35, 3-37, 3-49, 3-51).Several commentors, including both organized labor respondents, maintainedthat compliance with the guidelines ought to be mandatory (Exhs. 3-14,3-17, 3-22, 3-26). The majority maintained that they should not.Several commentors provided safety and health program manuals and materialsand suggested that the guidelines include appendices for industry groupsor examples of adequate programs, or ``question and answer'' examples similarto those in the ``Recordkeeping Guidelines for Occupational Injuries andIllnesses'' developed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Exhs. 3-13, 3-20,3-21, 3-30, 3-35, 3-43, 3-45, 3-46).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Issues and Rationale for Their Resolution  </ITAG>A. General Issues  Although commenters almost unanimously supported the concept of safetyand health program management, they raised several general issues and proposedvarious changes to the language. The general issues were:   (1) WhetherOSHA publication of guidelines would be useful; (2) whether a differentorganization of the management program elements would promote their use;(3) whether the guidelines should be mandated in the form of a rule; (4)whether a task group should be formed to determine the content of the guidelinesor appendices to the guidelines; and (5) whether various aspects of a safetyand health management program should be in writing.  1. Usefulness of the Guidelines  A few respondents stated that safety and health program guidelines wouldbe of no value or even counter-productive. These respondents stated, ``Wesee no reason for issuance of guidance * * *'' (Exh. 3-12); ``* * * guidelines,when issued by a regulatory agency can create confusion with respect tocompliance issues * * *'' (Exh. 3-41); and ``* * * guidelines are unnecessaryand put companies with comprehensive, long-standing performance-based programsat risk in being forced to comply with the very specific, prescriptivelanguage as proposed'' (Exh. 3-19).  Most of the respondents expressed the belief that the guidelines describepolicies, procedures, and practices which are essential to effective safetyand health protection and that they are sufficiently performance-orientedthat they can be met by a variety of methods. OSHA believes that the criteriadescribed are not unreasonably prescriptive and that they are unlikelyto conflict with effective programs already in place. They are not beingpromulgated as enforceable rules but are being issued as guidelines toassist employers in their efforts to maintain safe and healthful work andworking conditions.  In addition, OSHA has observed, and most commenters agree, that a significantnumber of worksites, particularly medium and small businesses, often lackthe professional resources to develop adequate safety and health managementpractices and programs on their own. In many larger worksites, some programelements are heavily emphasized while other important aspects are neglected.After careful consideration of the record and in light of the above, OSHAconcludes that safety and health management guidelines will not be unnecessarilyburdensome and will assist employers in their efforts to provide safe andhealthful employment.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Organization of the Guidelines  </ITAG>Some commenters suggested different methods of organizing the elementsof the guidelines or presented safety and health manuals in use at theiroperations which were organized differently. One respondent stated thatsince some of the most useful material in the notice requesting comment(53 FR 26790) was in the discussion of the guidelines, the suggested languageshould be expanded to include that material in the final guidelines. Asuggested revision of the guidelines was attached to the comment (Exh.3-22). This point of view was supported by another comment, ``* * * theinformation currently contained in the background section of the July 15preamble should be condensed into an introduction to the guidelines * ** OSHA should use [the analysis explaining the reasons for including eachprovision of the guidelines] in the body of the guidelines to ensure thatthe goals and objectives of the guidelines will be communicated to employers''(Exh. 3-46).  OSHA recognizes that effective programs can be organized and presentedin a variety of ways and that significantly different terminologies andapproaches are used by safety and health professionals and loss controlmanagers. While these differences often appear to be great initially, uponexamination by the Agency they are frequently found to address substantiallythe same components and objectives.Since the responses to the request indicate that the program elements weregenerally understood, the basic organization of the elements as presentedin the request for comments has been retained in the final version. OSHAhas, however, incorporated some of the background and explanatory materialsinto the guidelines to assist the employer's comprehension of the objectiveof each action recommended by the guidelines. In addition, OSHA has addeda Commentary following the guidelines themselves. The Commentary incorporatesand expands on much of the explanatory material from the notice requestingcomment.Another commentor questioned whether management commitment is appropriatelydescribed as a program element (Exh. 3-44B). OSHA agrees with the observationthat management commitment is not a program element in the same sense thatworksite analysis, hazard prevention and control, and training are. However,the eight actions described under the title ``Management Commitment'' arespecific program activities which directly indicate management commitment.At the same time, comments received on the nature and importance of employeeinvolvement in an effective safety and health program (Exhs. 3-17, 3-21,3-37, 3-43) suggest that such involvement merits clearer emphasis. OSHAhas therefore decided to modify the element title to read, ``ManagementCommitment and Employee Involvement.''<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Mandating the Guidelines</ITAG>Several commentors stated that the guidelines should be mandated and enforcedas a rule. For example, ``In our view, OSHA has the authority under theOccupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 to issue regulations mandatingworksite safety and health committees and broader workplace programs ** * we strongly urge the Agency to make this initiative a priority forregulatory action * * *'' (Exh. 3-17); ``* * * instead of a guideline,OSHA [should develop] a negotiated performance standard * * *'' (Exh. 3-14);``* * * a [safety and health management] program is [the] * * * basic responsibility[of employers] and they should be required to do so through regulation* * *'' (Exh. 3-22); ``* * * workplace health and safety programs are sovital that they should be <T3>mandatory,</T3> not voluntary as currently proposed * * *'' (Exh. 3-26);``* * * they should be proposed as a standard * * * the action could boostthe issue of occupational safety and health out of needless conflicts andconfusion to a higher order of national coherence'' (Exh. 3-28). On theother hand, other respondents ``* * * support the guideline versus thestandard approach * * *'' (Exh. 3-16); ``* * * management commitment cannot be mandated * * *'' (Exh. 3-3); ``* * * we recommend that no attemptbe made to enforce the guidelines as if they were a rule * * *'' (Exh.3-5); ``* * * encourage the Agency to issue these guidelines as advisoriesonly'' (Exh. 3-11).After considering written comments and oral presentations made at the information-gatheringmeeting, OSHA has decided to issue voluntary safety and health programguidelines rather than a mandatory standard. A period of experience withpublished program guidelines will undoubtedly produce refinements in methodsand practices, as well as provide evidence to indicate whether furtheraction by the Agency is required. Publication of guidelines does not preventthe Agency from undertaking regulatory action, if found to be needed atsome future date.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Task Group Consideration of the Guidelines</ITAG>Several commentors favored the formation of a task group representing theaffected constituencies and subject matter specialists to refine and furtherelaborate the guidelines (Exhs. 3-23, 3-35). It was also suggested thata bibliography of literature on safety and health management be developedand attached to the guidelines (Exhs. 3-36, 3-45, 3-46, 3-52).OSHA welcomes all information and voluntary efforts designed to supplementthese guidelines for use in special industry groups, special risk operations,small businesses, and any other applications. The Agency recognizes thevalue of these supplementary actions but will not delay publication ofthe guidelines while awaiting their completion. After publication, OSHAwill consider how best to utilize the offers of assistance in compilingsupplementary materials.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. Written Safety and Health Guidance</ITAG>A number of respondents strongly urged that safety and health programsbe supported by written guidance in all cases. ``Communication of authority,responsibility, and accountability to various parties must be written toprevent confusion and uncertainty'' (Exh. 3-35). ``The program will beunderstood better and managers can be held accountable more readily, ifthe specific elements of the employer's program are set forth clearly inwriting'' (Exh. 3-49). ``[A] truly effective safety program can [not] bemaintained unless it is reduced to writing. Understandings and practicesare too easily confused [considering] cultural differences, personnel retirements,transfers, etc.'' (Exh. 3-51). This point is reinforced by OSHA's experiencethat almost all of the worksites observed to have excellent safety andhealth programs have written guidance covering such issues as policies,practices, procedures, emergency plans, posted signs, and performance objectives.OSHA has noticed, however, that some businesses, usually small ones withless complex operations and/or potential hazards, effectively communicatepolicies and procedures orally and through example. It is not obvious atwhat level of complexity, or at what size of operation, written guidancebecomes necessary, nor which particular processes within various operationsrequire it.For these reasons, OSHA has retained in the final guidelines the languageproviding for flexibility in the use of written guidance but has addedinformation on the benefits of written guidance.B. Specific IssuesIssues dealing with the substance of the guidelines were: (1) whether employeesshould be involved in the structure and operation of the program and indecisions which affect their safety and health, (b)(1)(ii); (2) whetherthe system to encourage employees to report conditions that appear hazardousshould include the concept of protection from reprisal, (b)(2)(ii); (3)whether the term ``competent persons'' should be used, (b)(2)(i); (4) whether``a clearly communicated disciplinary system'' should be specified, (b)(3)(i);(5) whether employers can be expected to ensure understanding of rules,responsibilities, and procedures by members of their organizations, (b)(4);(6) coordination with other OSHA instructions concerning safety and healthmanagement; (7) providing guidance on recordkeeping; and (8) miscellaneousclarifications.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Employee Involvement</ITAG>Some respondents felt that OSHA's language on employee involvement, (b)(1)(ii),was too weak. ``[T]he central element of worksite programs should be safetyand health committees with worker participation * * * mandated by law''(Exh. 3-17). ``OSHA should require that workers be allowed to participatein all phases of the program'' (Exh. 3-26). Others felt that the languageimplied a transfer of decision-making authority to employees from employer.``Employers should determine * * * whether decision-making in this areawill be shared * * * or whether it would unduly interfere with the responsibilityto ensure a safe workplace'' (Exh. 3-49). ``Caution is urged as  * * *to the `decision-making' aspects of employee involvement * * * [T]he employeris responsible'' (Exh. 3-51). Another group felt that OSHA should not specifyemployee involvement (Exhs. 3-37, 3-43). Other commentors agreed with theOSHA concept of employee involvement in decision-making and suggested addedspecifications such as advising employee involvement in all of the suggestedpossible areas of employee participation (Exhs. 3-14, 3-26). Most testimonyat the public meeting which addressed this point also supported OSHA'schoice of language (Exh. 3-4; Tr. pp. 17, 24, and 36).OSHA has decided to retain the proposed language with slight revision,and with the addition of a clause that explains its intent. (See (c)(1)(4).)OSHA agrees that responsibility for <T3>decision-making</T3> lies with the employer. It has found, however,that employee <T3>involvement</T3> in decisions affecting their safety and health resultsin better management decisions and more effective protection. OSHA has,therefore, added explanatory language in its Commentary on the guidelinesto make clear its intention to advise that employee not <T3>make</T3> decisions but that they <T3>be included in the process</T3> on decision-making on matters whichaffect their health and safety.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Employee Reports of Hazards</ITAG>Some commentors felt that OSHA provisions for employee reports of hazards,(b)(2)(ii), were inadequate. One commentor stated that ``* * * [a worksite]where employees know that management wants to be made aware of safety issuesand will take action to correct them, and even solicits such suggestions,is a better place to work'' (Exh. 3-29). OSHA's own experience, reflectedin the VPP requirements, indicates a clear need for a system under whichemployee reports of safety and health concerns are encouraged, protectedfrom reprisal, and given an appropriate response in a reliable and timelyfashion. OSHA agrees that a similar provision should be a part of theseguidelines as well. Accordingly, a separate provision to that effect hasbeen included in the section dealing with worksite analysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Use of the Term ``Competent Person''</ITAG>Several respondents questioned the use of the term ``competent persons,''(b)(2)(i), to describe the need for expertise and experience in the conductof periodic worksite analysis (Exh. 3-46). No one disputed whether personsconducting the analysis should be competent but questioned whether theterm ``competent'' might be misunderstood in view of the many differentrisk situations and conditions possible in various workplaces and giventhat the term has specific meaning in maritime and construction standards.Since the performance objective of a worksite analysis is defined in thephrase ``so that all hazards and potential hazards are identified,'' OSHAagrees that it is not necessary to state the need for competence by personswho perform the work. That need is implicit. The emphasis on competencewas included initially because many processes, equipment, and substancesin use at worksites may pose hazards beyond the recognition of the employerand employees at the site. This point is made clear in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)and the term ``competent'' has been removed. A discussion of the relativecompetence needed for the various approaches to worksite analysis is, however,included in the Commentary.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Discipline </ITAG>The proposed guidelines called for ``a clearly communicated disciplinarysystem'' as one of the sub-elements for hazard prevention and control,(b)(3)(i). One respondent suggested that such a system is more logicallya part of training. Others questioned whether it should be contained inthe guidelines at all. For example, ``* * * it is not within OSHA's jurisdictionto dictate employer-employee relations. Secondly, it has been our experiencethat all too often the `careless worker' is blamed. In almost every instancewe have been able to identify external causes that contributed to workers's`unsafe' behavior, such as hazardous conditions * * * production quotas/timepressure, inadequate training, etc.'' (Exh. 3-26). On the other hand, somecommentors felt that OSHA had not emphasized discipline enough. For example,``* * * the guidelines [should] be more direct and also detail a compulsorydisciplinary system or structure * * * to avoid vagueness, to establishconsistency and fairness * * * and to take the onerous load off those whowould othewise be loath to be so strict'' (Exh. 3-10). ``[The guidelines]should include * * * the concept that <T3>all </T3>employees have certain responsibilities regarding health andsafety which if not exercised adequately will result in some type of disciplinaryaction'' (Exh. 3-20). In the revised final version of the guidelines, OSHA refers to enforcementof safe work procedures through a clearly communicated disciplinary systemwhere necessary to the control or prevention of hazards. (See paragraph(c)(3)(i).) OSHA views this reference to enforcement through a disciplinaryprocedure as an indispensable piece of a whole approach to safety and healthprotection. Based on OSHA's experience and in light of the record, theAgency concludes that there is little possibility of effective safety andhealth protection without carefully designed rules for safe and healthfulpractices that cover all personnel, from the site manager to the hourlyemployees. Since those most involved with activity which could expose themto hazards are often the hourly employees, it makes good sense to involvethem in the establishment of safe work practices and safe work rules aswas discussed at the public meeting (Tr. pp. 117-118). Once these workpractices are established and those who are expected to follow them understandwhy it is important to follow them, it is OSHA's experience that thereis little need to utilize a corrective disciplinary system to ensure thatthey are followed. When safe work practices, clearly understood and fairly enforced disciplinaryprocedures, and management accountability go hand-in-hand, there is littleopportunity to push workers into taking short cuts. OSHA is not in anyway suggesting harsh or punitive measures in lieu of the elimination orcontrol of physical hazards. OSHA concludes that an organizational disciplineexists for all levels of personnel at a worksite and believes that theapplication of that system to safety and health program activities is animportant and appropriate concern for OSHA in the provision of safety andhealth management guidelines. Therefore, the language concerning disciplineand enforcement is retained in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) and (c)(4)(ii). Anelaboration of its rationale is included in the Commentary. <ITAG tagnum="81">5. Ensuring Understanding </ITAG>Several commentors objected that employers can never perfectly ensure thatall employees understand all rules, responsibilities, and procedures. Theyrecommended that the words ``ensure understanding'' be deleted from theguidelines and suggested using language similar to that provided in onecomment, that ``* * * all employees should be provided with training''(Exh. 3-54). It is OSHA's experience that the quality, content, and success of trainingvary widely. The act of training itself is not the result that OSHA recommendsfor effective worker protection. OSHA recognizes the natural limits ofcommunication and comprehension, and agrees that some reasonable interpretationof the phrase ``ensure understanding'' must be applied. The term used inthe guidelines is intended to convey a need for individuals to verify bysome reasonable means that hazard information and the necessary elementsof a safety and health program are understood by the people who must dealwith them. This can be done by formal testing, oral questioning, observation,or other means. In fact, observation and interviewing of employees arekey methods used by OSHA in VPP reviews to determine, among other things,the quality of employee safety, health, and emergency training. The termis intended to convey the same diligence that would be applied to ensuringan understanding of other operational requirements, such as time and attendance,production schedules, and job skills. The Agency is retaining the words``ensure understanding'' in paragraphs (c)(4)(i), (ii) and (iii). <ITAG tagnum="81">6. Coordination with Other OSHA Instructions </ITAG>Some respondents from Federal Agencies expressed concern that the proposedguidelines might conflict with requirements for safety and health managementalready established by OSHA for Federal Government agencies (Exhs 3-10,3-44). Before preparing the final version, OSHA compared the proposed guidelinesto existing Federal Agency requirements, its instructions to complianceofficers for determining whether to do full or partial inspections basedon safety and health program management, the requirements for the VPP,and the 7(c)(1) consultation safety and health program elements. The expandedsub-element on employee reports of hazards and the explanation added tothe sub-element on employee involvement concerning protection from discriminationresulted in part from those comparisons. With these additions, OSHA concludedthat, while these guidelines may lead to adjustments in the other policiesreviewed, they pose no fundamental conflict with those policies. <ITAG tagnum="81">7. Recordkeeping </ITAG>Two of the commentors stated that OSHA should address the keeping of injuryrecords (Exhs. 3-49, 3-51). To avoid confusing duplication, OSHA has decidednot to include areas which are fully covered by regulation. No languageconcerning recordkeeping was added to the guidelines. The guidelines do,however, deal with the effective use of occupational injury and illnessdata. (See (c)(2)(v).)<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Miscellaneous </ITAG>Some commentors stated concerns with the use in the proposed guidelinesof ``OSHA advises,'' pointing out that this language appears in regulationand makes the guidelines sound less voluntary. The use of the word ``encourage''was suggested as an alternative (Exhs. 3-14, 3-54). OSHA does not agreethat the use of ``advise'' constitutes a requirement; rather it indicatesadvice which may or may not be accepted. OSHA has, however, added the words``and encourages'' to ``advises'' in paragraph (a)(1), to ensure that employersunderstand the voluntary nature of the guidelines. One commentor suggested that ``facility'' be added to the guideline languageon preventive maintenance of equipment (Exh. 3-28). OSHA agrees and hasexpanded preventive maintenance to include the facility as well as equipmentin paragraph (c)(3)(ii). Paragraph (c)(2)(i)(B), concerning analysis priorto use, was also changed to include ``facility.'' Another commentor suggested that OSHA use the term ``change analysis''in describing the necessity to review all new equipment, procedures, materials,and facilities to ensure that potential hazards are identified and preventedor controlled (Exh. 3-21). Finding merit in this suggestion, OSHA has addedthe term to the Commentary on this issue. A commentor suggested that OSHA make clear the necessity of safety andhealth training prior to the assumption of duties (Exh. 3-21). OSHA rulemakingrecords are replete with evidence supporting the need for such training.Consequently, such language has been included in the Commentary on employeetraining. Based on its own further review, OSHA has made several additional changes.(1) In the ``General'' section of the guidelines, the word ``systematic''has been added to emphasize the need for a systematic approach to all aspectsof safety and health management. (2) In the section on ``Management Commitmentand Employee Involvement,'' an initial sub-element has been added whichrecommends a policy statement on safety and health protection, to ensurethat all personnel concerned with the worksite understand the priorityof safety and health protection in relation to other organizational values.(3) In the first sub-element under ``Worksite Analysis,'' a distinctionhas been made between ``baseline'' comprehensive worksite surveys and ``update''surveys, to emphasize the importance of a comprehensive baseline recordfor subsequent worksite analysis. In this same sub-element, the referenceto ``phase hazard analysis'' has been dropped, because it is primarilyrelevant to construction. OSHA's request for comments and information was published in the ProposedRules Section of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 26790, July 15, 1988) based on the possibilitythat any guidelines issuing from it might be published in the Code of FederalRegulations (CFR). OSHA has decided not to publish the guidelines in theCFR at this time. The guidelines are therefore published as a notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Authority and Signature </ITAG>This document was prepared under the direction of John A. Pendergrass,Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Departmentof Labor, 200 Constitution Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20210. Accordingly, pursuant to the authority of the Assistant Secretary, thefollowing guideline is published.<ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC this nineteenth day of January, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.

Effective management addressesall work-related hazards, including those potential hazards which couldresult from a change in worksite conditions or practices. It addresseshazards whether or not they are regulated by government standards.OSHA has reached this conclusion in the course of its evaluation of worksitesin its enforcement program, its State-operated consultation program, andits Voluntary Protection Programs. These evaluations have revealed a basicrelationship between effective management of worker safety and health protectionand a low incidence and severity of employee injuries. Such managementalso correlates with the elimination or adequate control of employee exposureto toxic substances and other unhealthful conditions.OSHA's experience in the Voluntary Protection Programs has also indicatedthat effective management of safety and health protection improves employeemorale and productivity, as well as significantly reducing workers' compensationcosts and other less obvious costs of work-related injuries and illnesses.Through an analysis of public comment received in response to its requestand through an earlier review of literature, OSHA has found that the conclusionsit has reached from its own experience are supported by a substantial bodyof expert and practitioner opinion.Based on this cumulative evidence that systematic management policies,procedures and practices are fundamental to the reduction of work-relatedinjuries and illnesses and their attendant economic costs, OSHA offersthe following guidelines for effective management of worker safety andhealth protection. OSHA urges all employers to establish and to maintainprograms which meet these guidelines in a manner which addresses the specificoperations and conditions of their worksites.The Guidelines(a) <T3>General. </T3>(1) Employers are advised and encouraged to instituteand maintain in their establishments a program which provides systematicpolicies, procedures, and practices that are adequate to recognize andprotect their employees from occupational safety and health hazards.(2) An effective program includes provisions for the systematic identification,evaluation, and prevention or control of general workplace hazards, specificjob hazards, and potential hazards which may arise from foreseeable conditions.(3) Although compliance with the law, including specific OSHA standards,is an important objective, an effective program looks beyond specific requirementsof law to address all hazards. It will seek to prevent injuries and illnesses,whether or not compliance is at issue.(4) The extent to which the program is described in writing is less importantthan how effective it is in practice. As the size of a worksite or thecomplexity of a hazardous operation increases, however, the need for writtenguidance increases to ensure clear communication of policies and prioritiesand consistent and fair application of rules.(b) <T3>Major Elements. </T3>An effective occupational safety and health programwill include the following four elements. To implement these elements,it will include the actions described in paragraph (c).(1) <T3>Management commitment and employee involvement</T3> are complementary.Management commitment provides the motivating force and the resources fororganizing and controlling activities within an organization. In an effectiveprogram, management regards worker safety and health as a fundamental valueof the organization and applies its commitment to safety and health protectionwith as much vigor as to other organizational purposes. Employee involvementprovides the means through which workers develop and/or express their owncommitment to safety and health protection, for themselves and for theirfellow workers.(2) <T3>Worksite analysis</T3> involves a variety of worksite examinations,to identify not only existing hazards but also conditions and operationsin which changes might occur to create hazards. Unawareness of a hazardwhich stems from failure to examine the worksite is a sure sign that safetyand health policies and/or practices are ineffective. Effective managementactively analyzes the work and worksite, to <T3>anticipate</T3> and prevent harmful occurrences.(3) <T3>Hazard prevention and control</T3> are triggered by a determinationthat a hazard or potential hazard exists. Where feasible, hazards are preventedby effective design of the job site or job. Where it is not feasible toeliminate them, they are controlled to prevent unsafe and unhealthful exposure.Elimination or control is accomplished in a timely manner, once a hazardor potential hazard is recognized.(4) <T3>Safety and health training</T3> addresses the safety and health responsibilitiesof all personnel concerned with the site, whether salaried or hourly. Itis often most effective when incorporated into other training about performancerequirements and job practices. Its complexity depends on the size andcomplexity of the worksite, and the nature of the hazards and potentialhazards at the site.(c) <T3>Recommended Actions.</T3> (1) <T3>Management Commitment and Employee Involvement.</T3> (i) State clearlya worksite policy on safe and healthful work and working conditions, sothat all personnel with responsibility at the site and personnel at otherlocations with responsibility for the site understand the priority of safetyand health protection in relation to other organizational values.(ii) Establish and communicate a clear goal for the safety and health programand objectives for meeting that goal, so that all members of the organizationunderstand the results desired and the measures planned for achieving them.(iii) Provide visible top management involvement in implementing the program,so that all will understand that management's commitment is serious.(iv) Provide for and encourage employee involvement in the structure andoperation of the program and in decisions that affect their safety andhealth, so that they will commit their insight and energy to achievingthe safety and health program's goal and objectives.(v) Assign and communicate responsibility for all aspects of the program,so that managers, supervisors, and employees in all parts of the organizationknow what performance is expected of them.(vi) Provide adequate authority and resources to responsible parties, sothat assigned responsibilities can be met.(vii) Hold managers, supervisors, and employees accountable for meetingtheir responsibilities, so that essential tasks will be performed.(viii) Review program operations at least annually to evaluate their successin meeting the goal and objectives, so that deficiencies can be identifiedand the program and/or the objectives can be revised when they do not meetthe goal of effective safety and health protection.(2) <T3>Worksite Analysis.</T3> (i) So that all hazards are identified:(A) Conduct comprehensive baseline worksite surveys for safety and healthand periodic comprehensive update surveys;(B) Analyze planned and new facilities, processes, materials, and equipment;and(C) Perform routine job hazard analyses.(ii) Provide for regular site safety and health inspections, so that newor previously missed hazards and failures in hazard controls are identified.(iii) So that employee insight and experience in safety and health protectionmay be utilized and employee concerns may be addressed, provide a reliablesystem for employees, without fear of reprisal, to notify management personnelabout conditions that appear hazardous and to receive timely and appropriateresponses; and encourage employees to use the system.(iv) Provide for investigation of accidents and ``near miss'' incidents,so that their causes and means for their prevention are identified.(v) Analyze injury and illness trends over time, so that patterns withcommon causes can be identified and prevented.(3) <T3>Hazard Prevention and Control.</T3> (i) So that all current and potentialhazards, however detected, are corrected or controlled in a timely manner,establish procedures for that purpose, using the following measures:(A) Engineering techniques where feasible and appropriate;(B) Procedures for safe work which are understood and followed by all affectedparties, as a result of training, positive reinforcement, correction ofunsafe performance, and, if necessary, enforcement through a clearly communicateddisciplinary system;(C) Provision of personal protective equipment; and(D) Administrative controls, such as reducing the duration of exposure.(ii) Provide for facility and equipment maintenance, so that hazardousbreakdown is prevented.(iii) Plan and prepare for emergencies, and conduct training and drillsas needed, so that the response of all parties to emergencies will be ``secondnature.''(iv) Establish a medical program which includes availability of first aidon site and of physician and emergency medical care nearby, so that harmwill be minimized if an injury or illness does occur.(4) <T3>Safety and Health Training. </T3>(i) Ensure that all employees understandthe hazards to which they may be exposed and how to prevent harm to themselvesand others from exposure to these hazards, so that employees accept andfollow established safety and health protections.(ii) So that supervisors will carry out their safety and health responsibilitieseffectively, ensure that they understand those responsibilities and thereasons for them, including:(A) Analyzing the work under their supervision to identify unrecognizedpotential hazards;(B) Maintaining physical protections in their work areas; and(C) Reinforcing employee training on the nature of potential hazards intheir work and on needed protective measures, through continual performancefeedback and, if necessary, through enforcement of safe work practices.(iii) Ensure that managers understand their safety and health responsibilities,as described under (c)(1), ``Management Commitment and Employee Involvement,''so that the managers will effectively carry out those responsibilities.The Commentary<ITAG tagnum="81">(Paragraph by Paragraph)</ITAG>This Commentary indicates the background and rationale for each part ofthe guidelines. To facilitate its use, each segment of the guidelines exceptthe Introduction is repeated just before it is discussed. The backgroundof the Introduction immediately follows this paragraph.<ITAG tagnum="81">Introduction</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment on Introduction. </T3>Over the years, OSHA and State enforcementand consultation staff have seen many examples of exemplary workplaceswhere safety and health programs were well managed and where injury rateswere exceptionally low. The common characteristics observed at these siteswere the use of organized and systematic methods to assign appropriateresponsibility to all managers, supervisors, and employees, to inspectregularly for and control existing and potential hazards, and to orientand train all employees in the ways and means to eliminate or avoid thosehazards.The fundamental importance of such methods has been reflected in decisionsof the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission and the U.S. Courtsof Appeal, especially in cases involving an employer claim that a violativeworkplace condition or action resulted from unpreventable employee misconduct.Such misconduct has been recognized as a defense against citation onlywhen an employer had a work rule prohibiting the conduct, had providedtraining to ensure that the rule was understood, and had supplied adequatesupervision (including regular inspections and work rule enforcement) toensure that the work rule was followed. These criteria have been appliedby the courts in cases involving the citation of OSHA standards as wellas the general duty clause. The implication of these cases is that an employerhas the duty to establish and maintain such management practices, to theextent that they are necessary to ensure that safe and healthful workingconditions are maintained and that safe and healthful work practices arefollowed.OSHA has reflected its increasing recognition of the importance of effectivesafety and health program management by including program management requirementsin standards; by recommending safety and health program improvements inconjunction with inspections; by issuing citations under the general dutyclause of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (Sec. 5(a)(1),29 U.S.C. 654) which include safety and health management factors; by revisingits State-operated consultation program to focus on the promotion of effectivesafety and health management; and by a range of other promotional efforts.To further encourage employers and employees to adopt and improve existingsafety and health programs, OSHA established, on July 2, 1982 (47 FR 29025),the Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) to recognize worksites with exemplarysafety and health management. The participation requirements embodied inthe VPP are a distillation of the means, methods, and processes alreadyin use at worksites where safety and health conditions are exceptionallygood.Because VPP participating worksites are officially recognized and are excludedfrom routine programmed OSHA inspections, the quality of the safety andhealth programs at these sites must be maintained as models of effectiveness.In 1988, 62 sites were participating in the VPP, and several had been inthe program for five or more years. Collectively, during their participationin the VPP, these sites experienced lost-time injuries that were approximatelyone-fifth to one-third of the average for their industrial classifications.(Unpublished statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA, 1988.)The fact that VPP participants have injury rates which are so much lowerthan their industry averages demonstrates that significant reduction ispossible. It also strongly indicates that the requirements of the VPP,distilled in the management policies, procedures, and practices describedin these recommended guidelines, are major means to achieve the reduction.In addition, employers at these sites reported improved morale and productivitybenefits, as well as significantly reduced workers' compensation and othercosts. One plant manager found that the implementation of a single safework practice at his 44-employee plant during the first three years ofparticipation in the VPP resulted in a greater volume of product and areduction in rejected product. This change alone saved $265,000 a year.(Proceedings of Public Information Gathering Meeting on Suggested Guidelinesfor General Safety and Health Programs, U.S. Department of Labor, OSHA,Docket No. C-02, p. 77 (October 6, 1988).)The reduction in workers' compensation and other costs and the improvementsin worksite morale and productivity reported by VPP participants reflectsignificant economic benefits which complement the substantial safety andhealth benefits of improved management of worker protection. A BusinessRoundtable report (<T3>Improving Construction Safety Performance </T3>(New York, The BusinessRoundtable, Report A-3, January, 1982), p. 16) concludes that, for construction,the savings from effective administration of safety and health protectionis 3.2 times the cost. OSHA has no independent confirmation of this rationor of its relevance to industries other than construction. Based on itsexperience with VPP sites and the conclusions of experienced safety andhealth professionals, however, OSHA believes that the long-term benefitsof effective safety and health management consistently exceed its costs.To understand this conclusion, it is essential to understand the indirectas well as the direct costs of occupational injuries and illnesses. Accordingto commonly accepted safety management concepts as outlined by Frank E.Bird, Jr. in his <T3>Management Guide to Loss Control </T3>(Loganville, GA: Institute Press,1978), for every $1 in medical or insurance compensation costs (``directcosts'') for a worker injury, $5-50 more are likely to be spent on ``indirectcosts'' to repair building, tool or equipment damage; to replace damagedproducts or materials; and to make up for losses from production delaysand interruptions. An additional $1-3 in indirect costs will be spent forhiring and training replacements and for time to investigate the incident.Mr. Bird's figures do not consider the impact of reduced commitment towork when employees operate in a situation in which injuries are common.Because they frequently involve longer absences, the impact of job-relatedillnesses can be even greater.Although economic incentives are secondary to human health and safety asmotives for safety and health protection, an employer may find it usefulto calculate the total (direct and indirect) costs of injuries and illnessesas a means of determining the economic benefits which might be achievedby preventing the injuries and illnesses. By determining the average costof an injury and of an illness, the employer can estimate the incrementalimpact of reducing the rate of injuries and illnesses at the site and thereforethe potential economic benefit of such reduction.Some employers may wish to compare their savings or costs in relation tothe national average for their industries. A method which can be used forthat comparison with respect to occupational injuries is described by DavidR. Bell, a former OSHA employee, in his article, ``Gauging Safety Outlaysand Objectives,'' in <T3>Occupational Hazards,</T3> June, 1987. If the lost workday case rate(LWCR) for a site is <T3>below</T3> the national average, a formula provided by Bell can beused to calculate how many fewer injuries occurred than would have occurredif the site rate had equalled the national average. (Lost workday caserates are published annually by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in ``OccupationalInjuries and Illnesses in the United States by Industry'', available fromthe U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. The rate foreach industry represents the average number of lost workday cases thatoccurred per 100 employees in the industry.)The number of cases which would have occurred if the site rate had beenaverage Bell calls ``expected cases.'' The difference between the ``expectedcases'' and the actual cases he calls ``injuries avoided.'' His formula,in which ``employment at the site'' means the number of equivalent work-yearsat the site during the year, is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,aw,39,1,18,1,16,1,27</C><H1>Industry LWCR andmultiply; Employment at the site</H1><H2>100</H2><H1>=</H1><H1>Expected LWCases</H1><H1>^ </H1><H1>Actual LWCases</H1><H1>=</H1><H1>Number of Injuries Avoided</H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG>If the site lost workday case rate is above, the national average, thenumber of cases by which the site exceeds the national average can be determinedby subtracting ``expected cases'' from ``actual cases,'' once the formernumber has been calculated.By multiplying the number of ``injuries avoided'' or the number of injuriesabove the average by the average cost of an injury at the site, the employercan estimate the savings or losses which resulted from the quality of itsmanagement of safety protection relative to national performance. (Becausenational data on the incidence of occupational illnesses is incomplete,the formula is less useful in relation to occupational health protection.)<ITAG tagnum="81">(a) General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">``(a) </ITAG><T3>General.</T3> (1) Employers are advised and encouraged to instituteand maintain in their establishments a program which provides systematicpolicies, procedures, and practices that are adequate to recognize andprotect their employees from occupational safety and health hazards.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment:</T3> In essence, this paragraph states that the end (protectionof employees from occupational safety and health hazards) determines themeans. The criterion for determining what is needed in a safety and healthprogram at a particular site is: whatever feasible action it takes to protectthe workers from the safety and health hazards at that specific site. Theform of the safety and health program elements and implementing actionswill vary at each site according to the nature of site organization andthe nature of the hazards and potential hazards at the site.<ITAG tagnum="20">``(2) An effective program includes provisions for the systematicidentification, evaluation, and prevention or control of general workplacehazards, specific job hazards and potential hazards which may arise fromforeseeable conditions.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment:</T3> Provisions for identifying and preventing hazards are<T3>systematic.</T3> If not, hazards or potential hazards will be missedand/or preventive controls will break down, and the chance of injury orillness will significantly increase.General workplace hazards include such conditions as tripping hazards inwalking areas and poor illumination. Specific job hazards may relate tothe specific conditions in a job, such as exposure to a saw blade, or tothe inherent hazardousness of an operation required in the job, such asthe removal of jammed material from a point of operation. Potential hazardsinclude such situations as the possibility of exposure to toxic chemicalsas a result of a rupture of piping from the impact of a forklift.<ITAG tagnum="20">``(3) Although compliance with the law, including specific OSHA standards,is an important objective, an effective program looks beyond specific requirementsof law to address all hazards.

Although compliance with the law is an important objectiveof and motive for an effective program, OSHA has found that the most successfulprograms look beyond government standards and legal requirements. Theylook for other sources of information about hazards, such as the NationalElectrical Code (NEC), the American Conference of Governmental IndustrialHygienists (ACGIH), and the American National Standards Institute (ANSI);and they use their own seasoned analytical abilities to look for and addresshazards not covered by government or other standards. Their motive is toprevent injuries and illnesses and the attendant human and economic costs,whether or not compliance with the law is at issue.This approach is essential in view of the difficulty that regulatory agencieshave in moving quickly to set standards for every possible hazard in theworkplace and to revise them when new information becomes available.<ITAG tagnum="20">``(4) The extent to which the program is described in writing is lessimportant than how effective it is in practice.

The more complex and hazardous an operationis, the more formal (written) and complex the program will probably needto be.

These practices,means, and methods are consistent with those used by employers to achieveother organizational objectives, such as cost control, quality, and productivity.Giving safety and health equal organizational priority in relation to theseother objectives is fundamental to the protection of individual employees<T3>and</T3> to the effectiveness of the organization itself.  These elements consist of methods historically used to accomplish organizationalobjectives. They are generic in that they are generally applicable regardlessof unique operations or conditions of particular firms. Only the form whichthey take varies. Though at points they are expressed in the terms of the``hierarchical'' organizations most common in American industry (i.e.,by reference to ``managers,'' ``supervisors,'' ``employees''), they caneasily be adapted to other organizational forms or styles of operation.They relate to essential concerns and activities of any organization. Itis on this basis that OSHA considers them applicable in shipyard employment,marine terminals, and longshoring, as well as general industry.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c) Recommended Actions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(c)(1) Management Commitment and Employee Involvement </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment</T3>: Each action listed in this section represents the applicationto occupational safety and health of a key means for organizing, motivatingand controlling activities within an organization.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(1)(i) State clearly a worksite policy on safe and healthfulwork and working conditions, so that all personnel with responsibilityat the site and personnel at other locations with responsibility for thesite understand the priority of safety and health protection in relationto other organizational values.'' </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment</T3>: A statement of policy is the foundation of safety andhealth management.

An effective program includes all personnel in the organization_managers,supervisors, and others_in policy development, planning, and operations.This does not mean transfer of responsibility to employees. The OccupationalSafety and Health Act of 1970 clearly places responsibility for safetyand health protection on the employer. However, employees' intimate knowledgeof the jobs they perform and the special concerns they bring to the jobgive them a unique perspective which can be used to make the program moreeffective. Employee participation may take any or all of a number of forms. For instance,the system for notifying management personnel about conditions that appearhazardous serves as a major means of worksite analysis to identify hazardsand is therefore included as paragraph (c)(2)(iii). Such a system is, however,by itself not sufficient to provide for effective employee involvement.Forms of participation which engage employees more fully in systematicprevention include (1) inspecting for hazards and recommending correctionsor controls; (2) analyzing jobs to locate potential hazards and developsafe work procedures; (3) developing or revising general rules for safework; (4) training newly hired employees in safe work procedures and rules,and/or training their co-workers in newly revised safe work procedures;(5) providing programs and presentations for safety meetings; and (6) assistingin accident investigations. Such functions can be carried out in a number of organizational contexts.Joint labor-management committees are most common. Other means includelabor safety committees, safety circle teams, rotational assignment ofemployees to such functions, and acceptance of employee volunteers forthe functions. Employee involvement is effective only when the employer welcomes it andprovides protection from any discrimination, including unofficial harassment,to the employees involved. However, inclusion of employees in one or moreof the suggested activities, or in any way that fits the individual worksiteand provides an employee role that has impact on decisions about safetyand health protection, will strengthen the employer's overall program ofsafety and health protection.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(1)(v) Assign and communicate responsibility for all aspectsof the program, so that managers, supervisors, and employees in all partsof the organization know what performance is expected of them.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>Assignment of responsibility for safety and health protectionto a single staff member, or even a small group, will leave other membersfeeling that someone else is taking care of safety and health problems.<T3>Everyone </T3>in an organization has some responsibility for safetyand health.

If management stateshigh expectations for such protection but pays greater attention to productivityor other values, safety and health protection will be neglected.To be effective, a system of accountability must be applied to everyone,from senior management to hourly employees. If some are held firmly toexpected performance and others are not, the system will lose its credibility.Those held to expectations will be resentful; those allowed to neglectexpectations may increase their neglect. Consequently, the chance of injuryand illness will increase.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(1)(viii) Review program operations at least annually to evaluatetheir success in meeting the goal and objectives, so that deficienciescan be identified and the program and/or the objectives can be revisedwhen they do not meet the goal of effective safety and health protection.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>A comprehensive program audit is essential periodicallyto evaluate the whole set of safety and health management means, methods,and processes, to ensure that they are adequate to protect against thepotential hazards at the specific worksite.

It also determines whetherthe objectives provide sufficient challenge to lead the organization tomeet the program goal of effective safety and health protection. When eitherperformance or the objectives themselves are found inadequate, revisionsare made. Without such a comprehensive review, program flaws and theirinterrelationship may not be caught and corrected.<ITAG tagnum="81"/><T3>(c)(2) Worksite Analysis</T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>The identification of hazards and potential hazards ata worksite requires an active, on-going examination and analysis of workprocesses and working conditions. Because many hazards are by nature difficultto recognize, effective examination and analysis will approach the workand working conditions from several perspectives. Each of the activitiesrecommended in this paragraph represents a different perspective.The recognition of hazards which could result from changes in work practicesor conditions requires especially thorough observation and thought, bothfrom those who perform the work and those who are specially trained forthat purpose. Since such divergence from the routine and familiar is oftenthe occasion for injuries and health hazard exposures to occur, the anticipationof such changes is critical.Identification at a worksite of those safety and health hazards which arerecognized in its industry is a critical foundation for safety and healthprotection. It is the general duty of the employer under the OccupationalSafety and Health Act of 1970. Successful employers will actively seekthe benefit of the experience of others in their industry, through tradeassociations, equipment manufacturers, and other sources.An effective program does not stop at this point, however. It continuallyreviews working conditions and operations to identify hazards which havenot previously been recognized in the industry.Implicit in the provision for the surveys, reviews, and analyses recommendedin this section is the need for employers to seek competent advice andassistance when they lack needed expertise and to use appropriate meansand methods to examine and assess all existing and foreseeable hazards.Personnel who perform comprehensive baseline and update surveys, analysisof new facilities, processes, procedures, and equipment, and job hazardanalyses may require greater expertise than those who conduct routine inspections,since the former are conducting a broader and/or deeper review.Personnel performing regular inspections should, however, possess a degreeof experience and competence adequate to recognize hazards in the areasthey review and to identify reasonable means for their correction or control.Such competence should normally be expected of ordinary employees who arecapable of safely supervising or performing the operations of the specificworkplace. Smaller businesses which need assistance in the developmentof such competence can receive free assistance from a number of sources,including OSHA and a nationwide network of OSHA-funded, State-operatedconsultation projects.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(2)(i) So that all hazards and potential hazards are identified:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) conduct comprehensive baseline worksite surveys for safety andhealth and periodic comprehensive update surveys; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) analyze planned and new facilities, processes, materials, andequipment; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) perform routine job hazard analyses.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment</T3>: A comprehensive baseline survey of the work and workingconditions at a site permits a systematic recording of those hazards andpotential hazards which can be recognized without intensive analysis. Thisbaseline record provides a checklist for the more frequent routine inspectionsrecommended in paragraph (c)(2)(ii). With those hazards under control,attention can be given to the intensive analysis required to recognizeless obvious hazards. Subsequent comprehensive surveys provide an opportunity to step back fromthe routine check on control of previously recognized hazards and lookfor others. With the baseline established, these subsequent reviews areone occasion for focusing more intensive analysis in areas with the highestpotential for new or less obvious hazards. The frequency with which comprehensiveexaminations are needed depends on the complexity, hazardousness, and changeabilityof the worksite. Many successful worksites conduct such reviews on an annualor biannual basis. Analysis of new facilities, processes, materials, and equipment in thecourse of their design and early use (sometimes called ``change analysis'')provides a check against the introduction of new hazards with them. Effectivemanagement ensures the conduct of such analyses during the planning phase,just before their first use, and during the early phases of their use.Numerous specific OSHA standards require inspection of particular equipment,conditions, and activities as a safety precaution prior to operation oruse. This guideline makes clear that, in effective safety and health programs,this generally recognized inspection practice is applied more broadly toall conditions and activities. Job hazard analysis is an important tool for more intensive analysis toidentify hazards and potential hazards not previously recognized, and todetermine protective measures. Through more careful attention to the workprocesses in a particular job, analysts can recognize new points at whichexposure to hazards may occur or at which foreseeable changes in practiceor conditions could result in new hazards.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(2)(ii) Provide for regular site safety and health inspections,so that new or previously missed hazards and failures in hazard controlsare identified.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment</T3>: Once a comprehensive examination of the workplace hasbeen conducted and hazard controls have been established, routine sitesafety and health inspections are necessary to ensure that changes in conditionsand activities do not create new hazards and that hazard controls remainin place and are effective. Routine industrial hygiene monitoring and samplingare essential components of such inspections in many workplaces. Personnel conducting these inspections also look out for new or previouslyunrecognized hazards, but not as thoroughly as those conducting comprehensivesurveys. The frequency and scope of these ``routine'' inspections depends on thenature and severity of the hazards which could be present and the relativestability and complexity of worksite operations.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(2)(iii) So that employee insight and experience in safety andhealth protection may be utilized and employee concerns may be addressed,provide a reliable system for employees, without fear of reprisal, to notifymanagement personnel about conditions that appear hazardous and to receivetimely and appropriate responses; and encourage employees to use the system.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment</T3>: A reliable system for employees to notify managementof conditions or practices that appear hazardous and to receive a timelyand appropriate response serves a dual purpose. It gives management thebenefit of many more points of observation and more experienced insightin recognizing hazards or other symptoms of breakdown in safety and healthprotection systems. It also gives employees assurance that their investmentin safety and health is worthwhile. A system is reliable only if it ensures employees a credible and timelyresponse. The response will include both timely action to address any problemsidentified and a timely explanation of why particular actions were or werenot taken.Since the employer benefits from employee notices, effective managementwill not only guard against reprisals to avoid discouraging them but willtake positive steps to encourage their submission.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(2)(iv) Provide for investigation of accidents and `near miss'incidents, so that their causes and means for preventing repetitions areidentified.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>Accidents, and incidents in which employees narrowlyescape injury, clearly expose hazards. Analysis to identify their causespermits development of measures to prevent future injury or illness. Althougha first look may suggest that ``employee error'' is a major factor, itis rarely sufficient to stop there. Even when an employee has disobeyeda required work practice, it is critical to ask, ``Why?'' A thorough analysiswill generally reveal a number of deeper factors, which permitted or evenencouraged an employee's action. Such factors may include a supervisor'sallowing or pressuring the employee to take short cuts in the interestof production, inadequate equipment, or a work practice which is difficultfor the employee to carry out safely. An effective analysis will identifyactions to address each of the causal factors in an accident or ``nearmiss'' incident.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(2)(v) Analyze injury and illness trends over time, so that patternswith common causes can be identified and prevented.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>A review of injury experience over a period of time mayreveal patterns of injury with common causes which can be addressed.

Itregards legal requirements as a minimum. When there are alternative waysto address a hazard, effective managers have found that involving employeesin discussions of methods can identify useful prevention and control measures,serve as a means for communicating the rationale for decisions made, andencourage employee acceptance of the decisions.When safe work procedures are the means of protection, ensuring that theyare followed becomes critical. Ensuring safe work practices involves disciplinein both a positive sense and a corrective sense. Every component of effectivesafety and health management is designed to create a disciplined environmentin which all personnel act on the basis that worker safety and health protectionis a fundamental value of the organization. Such an environment dependson the credibility of management's commitment to safety and health protection,through evidences of direct management involvement in safety and healthmatters, inclusion of employees in decisions which affect their safetyand health, rigorous worksite analysis to identify hazards and potentialhazards, stringent prevention and control measures, and thorough training.In such an environment, all personnel will understand the hazards to whichthey are exposed, why the hazards pose a threat, and how to protect themselvesand others from the hazards. Training for the purpose is reinforced byencouragement of attempts to work safely and by positive recognition ofsafe behavior.If, in such a context, an employee, supervisor, or manager fails to followa safe procedure, it is advisable not only to stop the unsafe action butalso to determine whether some condition of the work has made it difficultto follow the procedure or whether some management system has failed tocommunicate the danger of the action and the means for avoiding it. Ifthe unsafe action was not based on an external condition or a lack of understanding,or if, after such external condition or lack of understanding has beencorrected, the person repeats the action, it is essential that correctivediscipline be applied. To allow an unsafe action to continue not only continuesto endanger the actor and perhaps others; it also undermines the positivediscipline of the entire safety and health program. To be effective, correctivediscipline must be applied consistently to all, regardless of role or rank;but it must be applied.Factors which may affect the time required for correction of hazards include:(1) The complexity of abatement technology; (2) the degree of risk; and(3) the availability of necessary equipment, materials, and staff qualifiedto complete the correction. Because conditions affecting hazard correctionand control vary widely, it is impractical for OSHA to recommend specifictime limits for all situations. An effective program corrects hazards inthe shortest time permitted by the technology required and the availabilityof needed personnel and materials. It also provides for interim protectionwhen immediate correction is not possible.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(3)(ii) Provide for facility and equipment maintenance, so thathazardous breakdown is prevented.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>Maintenance of equipment and facilities in an especiallyimportant means of anticipating potential hazards and preventing theirdevelopment.

''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment:</T3> Planning and training for emergencies is essential inminimizing the harmful consequences of an accident or other threat if itdoes occur. If personnel are not so thoroughly trained to react to emergenciesthat their responses are immediate and precise, they may expose themselvesand others to greater danger rather than reduce their exposure. The natureof potential emergencies depends on the nature of site operations and itsgeographical location. The extent to which training and drills are neededdepends on the severity and complexity of the emergencies which may arise.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(3)(iv) Establish a medical program which includes availabilityof first aid on site and of physician and emergency medical care nearby,so that harm will be minimized if an injury or illness does occur.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment:</T3> The availability of first aid and emergency medical careare essential in minimizing the harmful consequences of injuries and illnessesif they do occur.

Minimum requirementsare addressed in OSHA standards.<ITAG tagnum="81">(c)(4) Safety and Health Training</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment:</T3> Education and training are essential means for communicatingpractical understanding of the requirements of effective safety and healthprotection to all personnel. Without such understanding, managers, supervisors,and other employees will not perform their responsibilities for safetyand health protection effectively.It is not suggested that elaborate or formal training programs solely relatedto safety and health are always needed. Integrating consideration of safetyand health protection into all organizational activities is the key toits effectiveness. Safety and health information and instruction is, therefore,often most effective when incorporated into other training about performancerequirements and job practices, such as management training on performanceevaluation, problem solving, or managing change; supervisors' trainingon the reinforcement of good work practices and the correction of poorones; and employee training on the operation of a particular machine orthe conduct of a specific task.Each paragraph in this section recommends that the employer <T3>ensure understanding</T3> of safety and health information by employees,supervisors, and managers. The act of training itself is not sufficientto ensure practical comprehension. Some means of verifying comprehensionis essential. Formal testing, oral questioning, observation, and othermeans can be useful. In its Voluntary Protection Programs, OSHA has foundthat observing and interviewing employees, supervisors, and managers arethe most effective measures for determining their understanding of whatis expected of them in practice. Although there is no fully reliable meansfor ensuring understanding, effective safety and health management willapply the same diligence with respect to safety and health protection asis applied to ensuring an understanding of other operational requirements,such as time and attendance, production schedules, and job skills.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(4)(i) Ensure that all employees understand the hazards to whichthey may be exposed and how to prevent harm to themselves and others fromexposure to these hazards, so that employees accept and follow establishedsafety and health protections.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment:</T3> The commitment and cooperation of employees in preventingand controlling exposure to hazards is critical, not only for their ownsafety and health but for that of others as well. That commitment and cooperationdepends on their understanding what hazards they may be exposed to, whythe hazards pose a threat, and how they can protect themselves and othersfrom the hazards. The means of protection which they need to understandinclude not only the immediate protections from hazards in their work processesand locations, but also the management systems which commit the organizationto safety and health protection and provide for employee involvement inhazard identification and prevention.OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard specifies, for chemical hazards, anemployer duty to inform employees about workplace hazards and to providetraining that will enable them to avoid work-related injuries or illnesses.Other standards set forth training requirements, as summarized in OSHAPublication 2254, ``Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and TrainingGuidelines.'' The rationale for these standards requirements is, however,applicable in relation to all hazards.Education and training in safety and health protection is especially criticalfor employees who are assuming new duties. This fact is reflected by thedisproportionately high injury rates among workers newly assigned to worktasks. Although some of these injuries may be attributable to other causes,a substantial number are directly related to inadequate knowledge of jobhazards and safe work practices. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reportsthat in 1979, 48 percent of workers injured had been on the job less thanone year. (``The New Worker Factor Associated with Occupational Injuriesand Illnesses,'' U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics,1982.) These figures make clear the importance of training employees onjob hazards and safe work practices <T3>before</T3> they assume new duties.The extent of hazard information which is needed by employees will vary,but includes at least: (1) The general hazards and safety rules of theworksite; (2) specific hazards, safety rules, and practices related toparticular work assignments; and (3) the employee's role in emergency situations.Such information and training is particularly relevant to hazards thatmay not be readily apparent to, or within the ordinary experience and knowledgeof, the employee.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(4)(ii) So that supervisors will carry out their safety and healthresponsibilities effectively, ensure that they understand those responsibilitiesand the reasons for them, including: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) analyzing the work under their supervision to identify unrecognizedpotential hazards; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) maintaining physical protections in their work areas; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) reinforcing employee training on the nature of potential hazardsin their work and on needed protective measures, through continual performancefeedback and, if necessary, through enforcement of safe work practices.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>First-line supervisors have an especially critical rolein safety and health protection because of their immediate responsibilityfor workers and for the work being performed. Effective training of supervisorswill address their safety and health management responsibilities as wellas information on hazards, hazard prevention, and response to emergencies.Although they may have other safety and health responsibilities, thoselisted in these guidelines merit particular attention.<ITAG tagnum="21">``(c)(4)(iii) Ensure that managers understand their safety and healthresponsibilities, as described under (c)(1), ``Management Commitment andEmployee Involvement,'' so that the managers will effectively carry outthose responsibilities.''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Comment: </T3>Because there is a tendency in some businesses to considersafety and health a staff function and to neglect the training of managersin safety and health responsibilities, the importance of managerial trainingis noted separately. Managers who understand both the way and the extentto which effective safety and health protection impacts on the overalleffectiveness of the business itself are far more likely to ensure thatthe necessary safety and health management systems operate as needed.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-1594 Filed 1-25-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-26-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
