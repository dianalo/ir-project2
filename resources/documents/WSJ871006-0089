Lawrence Jensen, head of the EPA's water pollution programs, called the package of regulations &quot;one of the most ambitious and important&quot; the agency has ever issued for water pollution.    The action came 15 years after the Clean Water Act of 1972 called for such controls and more than a decade after the agency agreed to set such standards in a court-approved settlement of a lawsuit by environmentalists. Elwood Forsht, the EPA's senior officer for the project, said the delay was needed to develop techniques for measuring many chemicals and to collect data on how well sewage treatment plants currently purify the water.    Mr. Forsht said state environmental agencies currently use their best professional judgment to set standards governing the pollutants that chemical and plastics plants can release into waterways or sewage systems.    Generally, the new rules specify minimum controls plants must adopt to remove specific chemicals, metals, solids and bacteria from waste water. For toxic pollutants, the EPA said its guidelines generally require that all plants match the &quot;very best technology performance&quot; achieved in currently operating plants.    A spokesman for the Chemical Manufacturers Association said the group had just received a copy of the rules and hadn't had time to analyze their potential impact.    The EPA predicted the new rules would force a shutdown of at least some production facilities at as many as 61 plants. Such closures could affect 3,389 people employed at those plants in West Virginia, South Carolina, New Jersey and Alabama, an EPA spokesman said. Profits or sales could be affected at another 82 plants, the agency estimated.    Mark Luttner, an EPA economic analyst, said the economic effects would be spread across a broad array of chemical plants rather than being concentrated in a few industry segments. One portion of the industry least affected, he said, would be fiber plants, which don't produce much water pollution.    To cushion the blow for some small plants, the EPA set less stringent rules for operations that discharge their waste water directly into waterways and produce less than five million pounds of products a year. These plants already are meeting tougher standards than plants that discharge into sewers, yet studies showed they would be disproportionately hard-hit by having to comply fully with the new standards.    The EPA estimated that the rules will lead to improvements in water quality valued at $178 million to $330 million annually, mainly in improved fishing, boating, and irrigation.    The EPA also announced that it will require public drinking-water systems to notify customers of the lead content in their water by next June 19. It also said it would require more water systems to tell customers any time they violate drinking water standards. </TEXT></DOC>
