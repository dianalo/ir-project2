The Ariane 3 rocket lifted off at 8 p.m. Thursday (7 p.m. EDT)from the European Space Agency's launch site on the edge of theGuianian jungle, on the northeastern coast of South America.   About 17 minutes later, the rocket attained orbit altitude andboth of the satellites separated successfully from the vehicle.   Officials at the space center called the launch ``a completesuccess.''   Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, the company createdto handle commercial shots, called the 25th launch of an Arianerocket ``a special launch, a symbolic shot.''   ``After the Challenger catastrophe of 1986, we were the onlyones capable of assuring, with the heavy responsibility that thatimplies, the replacement of the free world's satellites that werecoming to the end of their lives,'' he said.   The satellites aboard the Ariane 3 belong to GTE-Spacenet and toSatellite Transponder Leasing Corporation, a division of IBM.   Both are designed to expand and improve television signaldistribution, numeric telephone communications and datatransmission in the continental United States, Alaska and Hawaii.   The GStar III, weighing 2,799 pounds, will complete GTE'snetwork of three Spacenet satellites. All the satellites, built byGeneral Electric's Astro Space Division, were launched aboardEuropean rockets.   The SBS-5, constructed by Hughes Aircraft Corp., weighs 2,735pounds and is expected to function for about a decade. A similarsatellite was launched in 1984 and a third in the SBS series isunder construction.   Three more Ariane launches are scheduled before the end of theyear, including the November launch of an Ariane-4, the newgeneration of European rocket. If the launches are successful,Arianespace will have fired eight rockets into space this year.   Ariane holds 50 percent of the commercial launch market andholds contracts for 41 launches worth $2.2 billion. D'Allest saidArianespace had 30 rockets under construction and was in theprocess of ordering 50 more.   ``We have found clients throughout the world, including theUnited States. We think having 20 to 25 percent of the Americanmarket is feasible,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
