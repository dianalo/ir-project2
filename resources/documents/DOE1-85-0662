The PQS was developed as a high power pulse source to pump far-infraredlasers. In response to the recent interest in laser instability, it isnow being investigated extensively. Dynamic properties of the relatingmolecular systems are sensitively reflected in the transient pulse structure,and various features of PQS pulsation are realized, depending on lasingconditions and characteristics of the absorbing molecules. So far, inspiteof extensive efforts to analyze the PQS behavior, there is no good modelwhich reproduces the observed pulse structure with fidelity. Throughthe numerical integration of the rate equations systematic reproductionof all the PQS pulses, especially the PQS pulse with the undamped undulationwas accomplished. The undulation was revealed as a relaxation oscillationinduced by the relaxation of the lower laser level. The model also describesoptical bistability observed in the present laser system. The computercalculation based on the present model shows that chaotic pulsation isrealized led by the period-doubling route. This is the first demonstrationof chaos in a laser containing a saturable absorber. The present analysissuggests that it is possible by introducing saturable absorbers insidethe cavity to observe chaos even in small-gain lasers such as CO{sub2} and N{sub 2}O lasers far from the bad-cavity condition.
