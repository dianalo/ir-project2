Sean Mooney, executive vice president of the InsuranceInformation Institute, said Wednesday night's storm will addmeasurably to the estimated $1.2 billion in claims expectedto be filed in the wake of the California fire.</LP><TEXT>   The two catastrophes &quot;will have a noticeable effect onquarterly earnings, particularly for those with personallines of property casualty insurance that were hit both interms of wind damage here and fire damage in California,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Nationwide, insurers would have significant exposureon both coasts.&quot;   Mr. Mooney estimated the total claims at less than $2billion, far less than the claims filed from the combinationof Hurricane Hugo and the San Francisco earthquake in 1989,which totaled about $5 billion.   He said much of the damage in the East Coast storm wascaused by flooding, which generally isn't covered by privateinsurers. &quot;I think it will be significant, but not on theorder of the $750 million of {claims for} Hurricane Bob,&quot; headded.</TEXT></DOC>
