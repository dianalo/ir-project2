(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Tensions over Indian fishing rightsrose as about 60 protesters carrying signs and an American flagharassed Chippewa spearfishers on a northern Wisconsin lake.   ``If they (spearfishing opponents) keep up what they're doing,they're going to have spears in them,'' Tom Maulson, a Lac duFlambeau tribal judge and spearfishing organizer, said Sunday.   A Department of Natural Resources official said the tension atBig Arbor Vitae Lake was increased by the presence of a Republicancongressional candidate. The candidate, Kevin Hermening, said thecontroversy is an issue of citizenship.   ``We can't have separate rights for special groups of peoplebased on age, gender or race,'' Hermening told the cheeringprotesters Sunday night.   The Indians' right to spearfish in off-reservation lakes hasbeen upheld in federal court, but protesters say the fishingdamages stocks and hurts sportfishing, a major industry here.   The crowd traded verbal jabs with Indians and wardens from theGreat Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission took a boat out onthe water to count, measure and record the sex of fish rather thanface possible confrontation when they were brought to shore.   Counting fish on the water ``may well avoid another time of apossible confrontation,'' said George Meyer, DNR chiefadministrator of enforcement. He said spearfishing opponents becomemore upset and vocal when fish are counted.   State wardens planned to cite one of about 15 non-Indian boatson the lake with causing a hazardous wake, said Meyer. Officialsalso were considering whether to cite the boater with harassment.No one was injured in the incident, Meyer said.   An Indian report of a gunshot heard on Catfish Lake in VilasCounty was turned over to the county Sheriff's Department forinvestigation, said Dale Urso, DNR north-central district director.   This was the fourth year the Chippewa have exercised theirright, retained in 19th century treaties, to harvest resources innorthern Wisconsin lands ceded to the United States.   Protests have been violent in previous years, including shotsfired at some lakes in 1986. No serious injuries have beenreported, and a cadre of officers aided by a National Guard chopperis helping keep the peace this year.   Each Indian band is allowed 15 days of spearing and may take nomore than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lake's fishpopulation can tolerate. The season ends May 6.   The Indians fish at night, using lanterns to help them findfish, which they catch with spears up to eight feet long.Protesters say this is an unfair way to fish.   Meyer attributed the number of non-Indian boats on Big ArborVitae and some of the tension to the organized protest andHermening's presence.   He said there was a ``marked difference'' in the tension afterHermening returned from a boat ride to address the crowd.   ``His presence ... increased the size of the crowd and inparticular, some of his discussion after the boat came back in, inmy mind, did increase some of the tension,'' Meyer said.</TEXT></DOC>
