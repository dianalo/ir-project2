Mr. Minc is the managing director of Cerus S.A., Mr. De Benedetti's international expansion platform, and has thus taken on the role of point man in his most ambitious foray to date, the attempt to gain a controlling interest in Societe Generale de Belgique S.A., the huge Belgian holding company. Being right-hand man to Mr. De Benedetti sounds like an unenviable task. The Italian financier is a man with a clear vision and doesn't have a reputation for sharing power. But Mr. Minc clearly is more than just a lieutenant. &quot;It's a real duo,&quot; says one Cerus official. Another source who knows both men adds: &quot;He's the perfect match for De Benedetti. De Benedetti is the better business man, but Minc has more concepts.&quot;    Indeed, concepts, ideas and theories are Mr. Minc's hobbies. When he isn't conceiving major deals, he relaxes by participating in intellectual debates on such themes as &quot;What's left of May 1968?&quot; or &quot;Is equality a myth?&quot; (in May 1968, student unrest triggered major disturbances and labor strikes throughout France).    And when he isn't talking, he writes: His latest book, an essay on the welfare state, recently won a prize and has been on the best-seller list for three months. &quot;He has extraordinary cerebral power,&quot; says a banker who has worked with him. &quot;He has an astonishing I.Q.&quot;    Right now, Mr. Minc has put his cerebral power at Mr. De Benedetti's disposal, and friends say he sees his role as an &quot;idea man&quot; and strategist for the Italian financier. Like Mr. De Benedetti, his ideas can be unconventional in the often staid European business establishment.    An unabashed capitalist, Mr. Minc describes himself as a man of the left, like Mr. De Benedetti. A pure product of the French establishment, he takes pride in being &quot;anti-establishment,&quot; again like Mr. De Benedetti. A successful businessman, he leads what he calls a &quot;second life&quot; as an intellectual figure -- theorizing with Mr. De Benedetti about the ideas they share, such as the need to develop pan-European companies and strategies. &quot;Life is too short for you not to try to have two lives at once,&quot; he says.    While that may seem contradictory to some, Mr. Minc sees a common thread between raiding Generale de Belgique and defining &quot;left-wing free-market&quot; ideas.    &quot;In society, there's a party of movement and a party of order,&quot; he says, sitting in his stylish Italian-design office in Paris with his feet on the desk. &quot;The world is moving so fast that those who stay put, die. In the business field, we are the expression of the party of movement.&quot;    To Mr. Minc, Generale de Belgique is the ideal place to carry out his ideas. He and Mr. De Benedetti believe the Belgian company is a sleepy conglomerate with a &quot;feudal&quot; structure tied to the Belgian establishment. They want to revitalize it with modern management and make it the center of a vast European holding company to capitalize on the creation of a unified European market in 1992 through the breakdown of internal trade barriers.    &quot;We are here to modernize, to make things evolve from feudalism to capitalism and to anticipate the creation of the European market,&quot; says Mr. Minc, who views the battle for Generale de Belgique as &quot;a fight between the old and the modern.&quot;    In politics, Mr. Minc says the only force that can modernize society is the left because it is &quot;the only one that can create the necessary social consensus.&quot; His vision of the left is a social-democratic, reform-minded government that relies on the market rather than a statist, traditional socialist approach.    Mr. Minc graduated first in his class at the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, which would have paved the way for a technocratic career. But after four years of public service he chose private business. Says Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Banque Stern and a close friend: &quot;He could have become head of the Treasury or governor of the Bank of France, but he decided to take risks.&quot; Mr. Minc says, &quot;The idea of waiting 25 years to be head of the Treasury didn't appeal to me.&quot;    So in 1979, Mr. Minc became chief financial officer of glassmaker Cie. de Saint-Gobain. He met Mr. De Benedetti there, when Saint-Gobain took a stake in one of the Italian financier's companies. He joined Cerus when Mr. De Benedetti founded the holding company in 1986.    Mr. Minc's rapid rise irritates some. His self-assurance borders on arrogance and tactlessness, some say. Critics say he doesn't carry out the ideas he preaches, that his progressive views are original only because he says they're left-wing, but they are close to neo-conservative. Many in the French establishment &quot;would like to see him fall,&quot; says Mr. Peyrelevade.    But Mr. Minc is optimistic. &quot;Six months from now, I hope we will have succeeded in our Belgian move so that I will have more time . . . to write my next book about political philosophy,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
