 His editorial suggested asubstantial change to all sections, but from my standpoint, as the originalchairman of the Computing Practices Advisory Panel, the prime change is in anincrease in the page allocation to 25 percent for Computing Practices.andP;  Thispresents both an opportunity and a challenge.andM;In the May 1980 issue of Communications, Bob Ashenhurst, then editor-in-chiefof Communications, said in his introduction to our &quot;Editorial Definition forComputing Practices&quot;:andM;In response to requests by many ACM members for more practitioner-orientedarticles, Communications of the ACM is initiating in this issue a new sectioncalled &quot;Computing Practices.&quot;andP;  This...is part of an ACM effort to publishmore material of direct and immediate interest to computing practitioners.&quot;andM;In that issue, Bob Aiken and I then defined the goals of the section, andthey are still very similar today.andP;  We described the ideal ComputingPractices article as follows.andM;(1) The ideal paper is not just &quot;How I did it in my company&quot; but must alsocarry a clear message such as &quot;...and thus if you do this or somethingsimilar, your system will be successful too.&quot;andM;Possible areas therefore included:andM;* How to improve the information systems design processandM;* Future of computingandM;* Managerial aspectsandM;* Software techniquesandM;* ModellingandM;* Special software systemsandM;* Implication of new theory to application systemsandM;* Architecture of new hardware systems or large scale softwareandM;* Legal and social aspects, andandM;* Application of new methods from artificial intelligence, graphics,computer-aided instruction, psychology, and human factors issues at the userinterface.andM;(2) The ideal paper should not be too theoretical or &quot;narrow in scope.&quot;andO;Possible topics include survey and tutorial material; articles withexpository and lectural attitude (though not too biased or narrow in view);annotated compilations describing how the referenced articles form anintegrated whole; briefs, cases, methods, and problem descriptions; reviews;letters; items; announcements; and indexes.andM;The acceptance process was therefore one of formal reviewing rather thanrefereeing.andM;(3) The ideal article could be improved by the editorial staff.andM;We were sure that there was a lot of interesting material out in the realworld waiting to be shared.andP;  We were willing to help in making an articleeasier to read.andP;  Indeed, we have regularly worked with the author to improveand rewrite acceptable articles.andP;  This has been achieved by providingtop-notch editorial support at Headquarters in rewriting for goodpresentation and aiding in reworking abstruse or incomplete sections (muchsuggested by the reviewers).andP;  You would shudder if you knew how much work wasexpended on some!andP;  We insist on a quality product.andM;Overall, we must have been very optimistic when we agreed to meet thisdaunting challenge, but with a dedicated board of panelists through the yearsand with the able support and promotional activities of a hardworking andstimulating Headquarters staff, we have apparently made it.andP;  Occasionally wemissed our mark on quality and timeliness, but we have not slackened ourdedication to these standards.andM;Of course, we could not have done it without the patience of the authors, whohad to deal with different and sometimes downright contradictory advice fromthe reviewers.andM;If you had been an original member of the panel you would know that we didnot always feel totally respectable at first.andP;  The section was a move to bemore in tune with the members, and yet we were not researchy.andP;  We were todeal with the practice of computers and computing systems.andP;  Thus, wegenerally did not referee new material but tried to find ideas useful andattractive to the practicing professional.andP;  The difference was inunderstanding that our format and section was to be differentiated from ACM'stop-of-the-line research journals.andM;Why did we take on the challenge?andP;  We felt that it seemed to be such animportant and valuable idea of the publications board--and one that themembership wanted.andP;  As a result, we started with some questions amongstourselves and made some tough early decisions.andM;As an example, one early article took us about 40 hours of panel andprofessional editing, a retyping at Headquarters, further editing of the newdraft, author rework, and final technical and professional editing.andP;  Some ofthe panel and Headquarters staff wondered whether it was worth the effort!andO;Apparently we met our goal, as we received several positive comments on thatparticular article!andM;A recent poll of the readership by the Gallup Organization revealed that themembers still want us to take on and meet this challenge.andP;  We now have morepages to do this and we are restructuring the editorial panel to be moreresponsive to today's needs.andP;  The new phase is not likely to be easier;though we have the people and the support it always takes work.andP;  We thereforehave asked ourselves the following questions:andM;(1) Will there be enough good papers to expand to a larger number ofComputing Practices pages per Communications issue?andM;(2) Who will handle the increased load of reviewing, editing, and acquiringarticles?andM;We arrived at the following answers:andM;(1) The readers must help us meet the challenge--there must be many goodpractical papers just waiting to be written.andM;(2) The expansion needs a managerial change.andM;The new editorial panel will help us with both answers.andP;  It will provide morecontacts with authors and a new source of special sections on timelysubjects.andP;  It will distribute the extra work among a larger number ofreviewers with greater responsibilities.andM;This panel will function much as the editorial panel for articles does.andP;  Thearea editors will give rapid assessments of the suitability and interest ofpapers for Computing Practices and will put those that pass this screeninginto review.andP;  They will make their recommendations for accepting or rejectingto the Computing Practices panel editor.andP;  Accepted papers will be processedby the ACM professional editors, who will work with authors to rewrite papersfor greater accessibility and clarity.andP;  All papers will be tracked fromHeadquarters so that we can ensure a timely response to authors.andM;Authors should submit their manuscripts to the Computing Practices editor, incare of ACM Headquarters and should indicate in their cover letters whichtechnical areas are appropriate.andP;  Submission information is given in themasthead.andM;The names of the new editors are listed in the masthead of this issue, and Iwill introduce them here.andP;  The areas and editors, in area alpha-order are:andM;1.andP;  Business, Governmental,andM;and Managerial ApplicationsandM;This area covers the application of information technology in control,resource management, and policy issues in the private and public sectors.andP;  Itwill include case studies, techniques and methods, and general large-scaletechnology, from military applications to MIS.andM;The area editor is Dr. Eric Clemons of the Wharton School, University ofPennsylvania.andM;2.andP;  Distributed ProcessingandM;(including Database andandM;Information Retrieval Applications)andM;This area covers all practical aspects of distributed systems, frommanagerial to technical aspects of communication, from economic to policyissues in security and integrity of the system, from technical to managerialissues in the component design, and for national and international interestsin privacy and security of such systems.andM;The area editor for this topic is Dr. Sol Shatz of the University ofIllinois.andM;3.andP;  Expert Systems and ArtificialandM;Intelligence ApplicationsandM;This area covers practical aspects in the design and use of AI systemsincluding knowledge representation, expert systems, problems in developingrule bases, and other material in the AI application arena.andM;The area editor will be Dr. Lance B. Eliot of the University of SouthernCalifornia.andM;4.andP;  Human Factors, Graphical,andM;and Multimedia ApplicationsandM;This area covers the interfaces between the person and the machine in alltheir aspects, from design to implementation to the problems in their use.andM;This section will have Dr. Christopher Fox of ATT Bell Laboratories as itsArea Editor.andM;5.andP;  Simulation, OperationsandM;Research, and StatisticalandM;ApplicationsandM;This area will cover methodologies and applications related to all forms ofmodeling and simulation.andP;  It will include modeling paradigms, statisticalmethods, and mathematical techniques for the construction of discrete andcontinuous models.andP;  It will also include practical concerns with dataanalysis, implementation strategies and practice, verification andvalidation, and output analysis.andM;The area editor will be Dr. Stephen D. Roberts of the Regenstrief Institutefor Health Care.andM;6.andP;  Software EngineeringandM;ApplicationsandM;This area covers subjects that are appropriate and timely for practicingsoftware engineers and their managers.andP;  It includes case studies, surveys,and new research results of immediate application.andP;  It also encompasses allaspects (e.g., standards, processes, languages, techniques, methods, andtools) of all life-cycle phases (requirements, design, participatory design,implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance).andP;  This area alsoincludes quality assurance, configuration management, software projectmanagement, verification and validation, software development environments,reusable software, prototyping, and measurement.andM;This wide and important area is receiving much attention today, and asubstantial number of our current submissions are in this field.andP;  Wetherefore first tried to split it into two, but it defied our attempts, asmany papers cross two or more parts.andP;  Our solution is therefore to have twoco-editors: Dr. Alan M. Davis of George Mason University and Mr. Brian Nejmehof INSTEP, Inc.andM;7.andP;  MiscellaneousandM;All articles that do not fit one of the above categories will be placed here.andO;New subjects with sufficient traffic will be recognized with their own areadesignations later.andP;  I shall act as the area editor here.andM;This restructuring should allow us to reveal some previously hidden gems byreworking and reprinting some of the best material from obscure publicationsor even from our own SIGs, thereby making the issues available to a largeraudience.andM;We shall also try a new packaging idea--based on some highly successfulspecial sections in the past.andP;  Approximately every four months, one of thearea editors will work with the editor-in-chief to solicit and produce aspecial section in a topic of choice in the area.andP;  The usual guidelines andprocessing for special sections will apply.andP;  We will coordinate these effortswith the Articles section, and in some cases, the entire issue will bedevoted to the same topic.andP;  We expect to announce the date of the firstspecial section early in 1990.andM;I invite your correspondence and comments on these ideas (even those thatseem to think we need a strong dose of fertilizer instead of flowers).andM;As we expand our operation, I should like to thank all of you, from theHeadquarters staff to the authors, from the reviewers to the readers, formaking the Computing Practices section so useful and interesting.andP;  I am sureyou therefore join with me in wishing success to this change.andP;  Keep thosepapers coming!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
