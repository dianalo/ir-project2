Raymond Meselsohn, president and chief executive officer, declined to comment further. A spokesman for First Jersey's chairman, Fredric Rittereiser, also said an announcement would come today, but declined to answer other questions.    Under its controversial controlling shareholder Robert E. Brennan, New York-based First Jersey became one of the best-known and fastest-growing securities firms by touting small, high-risk over-the-counter companies. In August, Mr. Brennan resigned his management positions in the wake of two major federal investigations into the company's dealings. Since that time, the management of the securities firm has been said to be interested in acquiring majority control from Mr. Brennan.    Closely held Sherwood, which through its Sherwood Securities unit also specializes in over-the-counter securities, has been seeking to make an investment in another securities firm. In November, an agreement to acquire troubled Rooney Pace Group Inc. fell through.    First Jersey and Sherwood recently have been linked as co-underwriters for some corporate securities offerings.    First Jersey has been the subject of several regulatory probes of its sales practices and the pricing of its offerings. The firm and Mr. Brennan repeatedly have denied any wrongdoing.    Last month, the firm was fined $300,000 and Mr. Brennan was fined $25,000 by the National Association of Securities Dealers in settlement of a complaint that the firm charged customers unfair and excessive markups on securities transactions.    The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining whether some of the firm's 36 offices have recommended that customers buy at a higher price the same stock that other offices recommended selling.    A special consultant reviewing First Jersey's business told a federal judge in October that the firm's trading in four stocks this year raises &quot;certain legal questions&quot; about what the firm discloses to its customers about its own stock positions. However, the consultant, who had been appointed by the federal judge as part of the firm's settlement last year of SEC charges, said that firm's practices had definitely improved since he reviewed them last year. </TEXT></DOC>
