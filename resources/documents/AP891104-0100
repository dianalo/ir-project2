Freedom!'' filled the streets of the capital Saturdayfor an emotional pro-democracy rally that was the largest in theCommunist nation's 40-year history.   The crowd jeered Communist Party leaders and cheered oppositionspeakers. Scores of people draped pro-democracy banners from theirapartment balconies and several elderly East Berliners wept withemotion as demonstrators marched past.   The three-hour rally, sanctioned by authorities, came a dayafter Communist leader Egon Krenz announced the dismissal of fivePolitburo members, promised broad political and economic reformsand urged East Germans to be patient and stay in their homeland.   But thousands of disillusioned East Germans ignored his pleasand continued to pour into neighboring Czechoslovakia, which threwopen its western frontier to refugees seeking new lives in WestGermany.   For many of those who stayed behind, the focus was on the rallyin East Berlin's sprawling Alexanderplatz and on smaller rallies inseveral other East German cities.   People from all over East Germany flocked to the capital, whichhas a population of 1.2 million, to urge democratic changes.   The state-run news agency ADN said 500,000 demonstrators jammedthe vast downtown square and surrounding streets. Witnesses,organizers and even East Berlin police estimated the crowd atcloser to 1 million.   ``After four decades we have found our voices again,'' saidStefan Heym, a prominent East German writer.   ``We are demonstrating for freedom, for a better life,'' said anEast Berlin woman who came to the protest with her young son.   Many carried signs deriding Krenz and the Communist Party,expressing distrust and despair that have mounted through fourdecades of rigid rule.   ``The eyes of the people are on you,'' one banner warned theleadership. ``We want glasnost, not sugar-coating,'' demandedanother.   Other banners challenged the leading role of the Communist Partyand demanded ``life without secret police terror.'' Many held upbanners of the New Forum opposition group. The crowd often chanted``Freiheit, Freiheit (freedom, freedom).''   Placards calling for an end to Communist rule were pasted on thewalls of several government buildings, including Parliament.   East German state-controlled radio and television carried livecoverage of the rally, indicating the media's greater opennessunder Krenz's leadership.   Speakers addressing the crowd included members of oppositiongroups, church officials, party functionaries and prominent artists.   They demanded an end to the Communists' monopoly on power, freetrade unions, an end to censorship, release of political prisonersand free elections.   Opposition leaders were cheered and party officials booed andwhistled at as they spoke from a platform mounted on a truck.   One of the biggest cheers went up when a non-communistpolitician repeated his demand for the resignation of the entireleadership.   The call was made by Manfred Gerlach, leader of the LiberalDemocratic Party. The party has led the drive for more independenceby the four small parties that until now had been closelyaffiliated with the Communists.   The Communists' unpopularity was made evident when East Berlinparty chief and Politburo member Guenter Schabowski took the stand.   Schabowski, who was instrumental in allowing Saturday'sdemonstration, was repeatedly interupted by boos and whistles untilan organizer stepped in and urged people to let him speak.   Schabowski's reassertion of East Germany's ``steadfastalliance'' with the Soviet Union drew loud jeers.   Jens Reich, a New Forum leader, received loud applause when hecalled for free elections. He said opposition groups should be``fully recognized'' and not just tolerated by Communistauthorities.   Markus Wolf, who headed the country's espionage agency fornearly 30 years before stepping down in 1987, drew cheers andapplause. Wolf has emerged as a chief supporter of reforms andthere has been growing speculation he could assume a top leadershiprole.   Speaking of violent police attacks against pro-democracydemonstrators in early October, Wolf said: ``We must never allowthose times to return.''   One Hungarian student was cheered when he called for a union ofdemocratic movements throughout Eastern Europe. Another speakerreceived long applause when he offered apologies to Czechoslovakiafor the Warsaw Pact invasion that crushed the ``Prague Spring''reform movement in 1968.   Hundreds of thousands of East Germans have demonstrated inrecent weeks across the country for democratic reforms. ButSaturday's rally surpassed by far any gathering seen to date.   ADN said that on Saturday, 40,000 people also demonstrated inMagdeburg, 12,000 in Altenburg, and several thousand in bothPotsdam and Arnstadt. Later, ADN said 30,000 demonstrated inRostock, 25,000 in Plauen and 20,000 in Suhl. Several thousandpeople also took part in protests in three small towns in northernEast Germany.   The tolerance of dissent and the promise of reforms by the newKrenz government, which replaced the hard-line regime of ErichHonecker last month, has failed to stop the exodus to the West.   More than 70,000 East Germans have fled their country in recentmonths, dissatisfied with Communist Party rule. Thousands morejoined them over the weekend.   ``Trust our policy of renewal. Your place, dear fellow citizens,is here. We need you!'' Krenz said in his Friday night addressbroadcast nationally.</TEXT></DOC>
