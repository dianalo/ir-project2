 We at GE-PG had this visionary view inmind back in 1983 when we began developing an optical disc storage andretrieval system.andP;  The system was destined to streamline the process ofgetting access to an intricate and important database of product-engineeringinformation.andM;Quick access to this design information created by GE-PG engineers wascrucial to our operation, which makes steam and gas turbines, industrialdrives and generators of all sizes.andP;  Today, this on-line image database ofover 2 million drawings is used by everyone in the GE-PG organization whoneeds to see the most current revision of drawings.andP;  Our engineers anddesigners, as well as our product service and manufacturing personnel, canall have on-line access to this information for their own work, no matterwhere they are located.andM;That access is assured by communications networks that speed this informationto our various remote sites.andP;  The actual optical image database from whichthis information is derived contains 15 million drawings and other relateddocuments.andP;  The majority of these engineering documents were created manuallyover the past 50 years.andP;  Thanks to the communications network and the imagingsystem, we are able to transmit this information from the on-line databasemore accurately and in less time than we could with the previous manualprinting methods.andM;Speed is particularly important when it comes to handling customer serviceand manufacturing requests.andP;  The service requests are continual, since GE-PGservices a wide range of customers--many of whom have depended on ourproducts for well over 20 years.andP;  To handle and accommodate this customerbase, GE-Power Generation has manufacturing and service operations, based notonly in Schenectady but in Bangor, Maine; Fitchburg and Lynn, Mass.; andGreenville, S.C.andM;The optical disc storage and retrieval system gives personnel in thesefacilities easy access to the pertinent engineering design data.andP;  Using thisinformation, they can then make the right decisions about manufacturing aproduct to customers' specifications.andM;A strategic component of our engineering information system, the optical discstorage and retrieval system, was purchased from Alameda, Calif.-based LittonIndustrial Automation Inc., Integrated Automation Division.andP;  Since itsinitial pilot in 1983, the imaging system has helped us to achieve verifiableproductivity gains and has grown to encompass over 100 terminals.andP;  Thesehigh-resolution display terminals, also from Litton, are decentralized overnetworks that feed information from the optical image database to some 2,500users.andP;  The user community, located either locally in Schenectady or atremote sites, includes personnel in our engineering, print service, productservice, purchasing, spare parts and manufacturing operations.andM;GE-PG's optical disc storage and retrieval system supports the on-lineviewing, printing and revision of engineering drawings and associateddocuments.andP;  Original drawings and text documents in the form of 35-millimetermicrofilm aperture cards are scanned and transformed into digitally encodedimage data.andP;  After these images are reviewed for quality, they are compressedusing Group 4 compression techniques set by the Consultative Committee onInternational Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT).andP;  They are then recorded onlaser optical discs.andM;The stored images are maintained on line by six Hitachi Ltd. library units inthe central Schenectady facility.andP;  Each unit contains 32 2.6-gigabyte opticaldiscs.andP;  Once an image is stored on an optical disc, it can be retrieved inless than 40 seconds for the purpose of viewing or editing, or it can beprinted out on a 3M model 689 laser printer.andM;GE-PG's image system consists of two basic subsystems, one dedicated tocontrolling the access of documents and the other designed to capture andstore the images themselves.andP;  The access subsystem is basically a directory,which includes the full document number, its revision status and the physicaladdress of the document's image on the specific optical disc.andP;  System-levelsoftware tracks all transfers of images within the system.andP;  In essence thatmeans no document image can be loaded into the system unless an entry forthat document already exists in the directory.andM;In addition, a VAX 6310 from Digital Equipment Corp., functioning as acontrol computer, runs several application programs that monitor multilevelsecurity checks; grant access permission; and generate reports, managementstatistics and database inquiries.andM;The image-loading subsystem, which captures the document images throughdigitally encoded raster scans, operates on another control computer, a VAX11/785.andP;  These images are entered into the system through two aperture cardscanners from the existing database of microfilm aperture cards.andM;Images are loaded in three basic ways: bulk loading, daily loading of all newand revised aperture cards and loading of all images requested from the userterminals.andM;Currently, two scanners operate concurrently, scanning at a rate of 15,000images a week.andP;  All the images are temporarily stored on a local magneticdisk for loading to the optical disc.andP;  But before this is done, the imagesmust be examined to assure 100% quality.andP;  The images must then be approved bya supervisor.andM;The entire image system includes 23 image controller clusters.andP;  Attached toeach cluster are the 200 dot-per-inch (dpi) Litton display terminals.andP;  Eachcluster includes an image compression/decompression board and a 600-megabytemagnetic disk drive that temporarily stores the images and provides access tothe most active images.andP;  The clusters are connected together through twocommunications networks--one for image traffic and the other for alphanumericor directory traffic.andM;Image traffic control across the network is handled by two gateways locatedat GE-PG's central database facility in Schenectady.andP;  This arrangementpermits us to expand the image controller clusters to satellite sites atminimum cost.andM;Long-term storage is accomplished with write-once-read-many (WORM) laseroptical disc technology.andP;  These 12-inch discs are stored in each of the sixHitachi optical disc library units in Schenectady.andP;  For image reproduction atthe customer service sites spread throughout the East Coast, documents areprinted on the 3M model 689 printers.andM;Transfer of the images from the central facility in Schenectady to the usersoccurs via standard protocols and hardware configurations.andP;  The key hardwaremodules are the image gateway, the image controller and the communicationsmedia.andM;The image gateway, a high-performance multiport switch from Litton/IntegratedAutomation, serves as the link to the remote image controllers.andP;  Thus, thisswitch provides a uniform method of image transfer suitable forcommunications within a building, across campus or to a distant locationusing either public or private networks.andM;The image controller residing at each remote location is actually a completeimage-processing system unto itself since it's capable of receiving anddelivering requests at the user level.andP;  It also expands the images thatarrive from the gateway in either CCITT Group 3 or Group 4 compressed form.andM;The communications media includes twisted pair cable, 9,600-baud analog andT1 1.544-megabit digital circuits on the GE corporate communications network.andM;Overall, the optical disc storage and retrieval system for engineeringdrawings and documents has increased productivity by providing improvementsin various areas.andP;  In particular, it has increased document security andquality.andP;  The scheme has also reduced the time it takes to access documentsand has provided better control of the drawing revision process.andM;On the business side, the imaging system has helped GE-PG trim its labor andmaterial costs, reduce its manufacturing losses and enhance its customerservice operation.andP;  In addition, the system's rapid transmission of drawinginformation to remote sites has enabled GE-PG to consolidate some of itsdepartments.andM;The addition of special raster edit software from Formtek now allows us tomodify any manually created drawing.andP;  This has resulted in major productivitystrides in our design office.andP;  Even more significant, it has provided us witha cost-effective way to exchange information with the companies in Europewith which we jointly manufacture products.andM;In implementing the image system over the past seven years, the biggestchallenge we faced has come from trying to tailor the application software toever-changing customer needs.andP;  In fact, the system software customizationrequirements have been far more difficult for us than the organizational orhardware aspects of implementation.andM;Today, we are facing our most formidable challenge yet as we attempt toexpand imaging technology further into our business.andP;  In order to do that, wemust integrate our complex business information systems with our image systemto come up with an overall information management system.andP;  This system willlink imaging technology with our decentralized computer-aided design (CAD)systems and provide access to office systems in order to support customerservice functions.andP;  Equally important, this fully integrated system will alsohave to connect to our factory automation systems.andM;The image system that GE-PG has in place today has already afforded us gainsin productivity and market competitiveness.andP;  The information managementsystem that will result from all these subsequent integration efforts isabsolutely vital for GE-PG if we are to obtain the next level of productivitypromised by this emerging technology.andM;James Kniskern is manager of engineering design and CAD systems in thedecision support operation of General Electric Co. in Schenectady, N.Y.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
