The chairmen of the three largest U.S. auto manufacturers,General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp., urgedTreasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Tuesday to affirm a Customsdecision that the popular vehicles are trucks and therefore aresubject to a 25 percent import duty, 10 times the duty levied oncars.   A reversal of the ruling would ``cause substantial harm to theU.S. motor vehicle industry, deprive the U.S. Treasury of severalhundred million dollars in anticipated tariff revenues, and unleasha long battle in the courts and in Congress...'' said GM's RogerSmith, Ford's Donald Petersen and Chrysler's Lee Iacocca.   A group representing dealers in imported vehicles, however,estimated the higher duty would directly add $500 million a year tothe cost of buying cars in the United States.   ``This is a $500 million new tax, in effect,'' said Bart Fisher,attorney for the American International Automobile DealersAssociation.   The association's president, Robert McElwaine, estimated thehigher import duty would add on average $2,500 to the price of eachvehicle. About 200,000 imported vehicles a year would be affected,McElwaine said.</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><NOTE>US Reviewing West German Chemical Deal</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal panel is reviewing the proposed saleof a California high-technology company to a West German chemicalfirm.
