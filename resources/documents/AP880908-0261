DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The principal defendants in the federalgovernment's long-awaited, massive insider trading suit againstDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and the head of its pioneering junkbond business say they welcome the fight as a chance forvindication.   Ending months of speculation on Wall Street, the Securities andExchange Commission filed a 184-page civil complaint Wednesday inU.S. District Court accusing Drexel and Michael Milken of engagingin a secret arrangement with convicted speculator Ivan Boesky thatincluded illegal insider trading, stock manipulation and fraud.   Drexel's chief executive officer, Frederick H. Joseph,reiterated the firm's longstanding claims that it would be absolvedof the charges. Milken also again denied any wrongdoing.   Wednesday's lawsuit capped months of guessing about whether thegovernment had built an extensive case against Drexel on evidenceturned up by the nearly two-year-old Boesky insider trading scandal.   SEC charges against Drexel, with whom Boesky worked extensively,widely had been expected since his illegal dealings were revealedin November 1986.   ``For the past 22 months I have been the subject of a shadowtrial of systematic leaks and innuendo based upon falseaccusations,'' Milken said in a prepared statement. ``...No onelikes to be sued, but I welcome the opportunity to have at longlast a full and open hearing of the allegations in an unbiasedforum.''   Joseph, who in July told Drexel employees to expect chargesagainst the firm, issued a statement saying: ``We disagree with thecharges filed by the SEC and in due course we expect to bevindicated.''   The SEC said it would seek to have the defendants _ threecompanies and six individuals _ surrender profits made from illegalstock trades. The lawsuit also sought from Drexel, Milken and CaryJ. Maultasch, another Drexel employee, civil penalties of threetimes those profits.   The agency offered no specific amount, but Sen. WilliamProxmire, chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, said the SECwas seeking $100 million.   Boesky, who is serving a three-year federal prison term on aninsider-trading related charge, was forced to surrender a record$100 million in penalties and illegal trading profits.   Drexel and Milken allegedly had an arrangement with Boeskyinvolving at least 16 series of illegal securities transactions.   Under that agreement, the SEC claimed, Boesky-controlledcompanies secretly bought, sold or held securities for Drexel orindividual defendants while Drexel sometimes reciprocated withsecret transactions for Boesky.   The SEC also alleged that Drexel and Boesky employees keptsecret, off-the-books records as part of the arrangement.   And the SEC claimed Drexel and Milken traded in securities usingconfidential information misappropriated from Drexel's own clients.   In 1985 Drexel allegedly made $1.23 million in profits usinginside information on a pending merger between Lorimar andTelepictures and allegedly avoided $1.78 million in losses thefollowing year after learning privileged information from ViacomInternational about a leveraged buyout proposal.   Federal law bars corporate executives, investment bankers andothers with access to confidential corporate information from usingit to trade in securities.   U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani, whose office prosecuted Boeskyand other Wall Street criminals, declined to comment on whetherDrexel or any of the other defendants faced criminal charges.   There had been speculation the SEC delayed filing its civilcomplaint to avoid interfering with a criminal probe.   In addition to Milken and Maultasch, a senior equity trader atDrexel's New York headquarters, other defendants included Milken'sbrother, Lowell J. Milken, of Los Angeles and Pamela Monzert, SantaMonica, Calif., both Drexel employees. Drexel's parent corporation,Drexel Burnham Lambert Group, also is a defendant.   Others defendants are Florida industrialist Victor Posner,president of Pennsylvania Engineering Corp. of Pittsburgh, whichalso was named as a defendant, and Posner's son, Steven N. Posner,a director and vice chairman of the board at PennsylvaniaEngineering. A spokeswoman, Renee Mottram, said the Posners had notseen the complaint and could not comment.</TEXT></DOC>
