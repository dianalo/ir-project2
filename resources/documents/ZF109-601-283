(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lower prices -- as low as $3,000 or less -- are attracting users to low-costPostScript printers and clones despite their slower speeds.andM;By Lawrence StevensandM;For small-business people, home-office workers and corporate users who wantto disconnect from a busy network, the biggest news about PostScript printersis that they are now affordable.andP;  This year, for the first time, you can gettrue PostScript or PostScript-clone machines for about $3,000 or less.andO;Apple's Personal LaserWriter NT leads the way in terms of brand recognition,but a host of other printer manufacturers have introduced products even lessexpensive than Apple's.andP;  And while you may have to be willing to acceptslower speed in return for saving a few grand off last year's prices, today'slow-end machines outperform Apple's original LaserWriter, which sold for$6,995.andM;These low-cost printers have produced a new wave of buyers.andP;  For example,Allen Bradley, senior research scientist at Corning Inc. of Corning, N.Y.,andO;had wanted for a number of years to disconnect from his company's networkedLaserWriter II NTX to save the time he spent retrieving his hard copy.andP;  Thisyear, when he saw the prices fall, as he put it, &quot;I realized I was in themarket for a laser printer.&quot;andM;He said he chose QMS Inc.'s PS-410 because, in his estimation, it is awell-constructed machine that performs well, and it fit his budget.andM;Having it both ways.andP;  MS-DOS users, who are accustomed to low-cost laserprinters that use Hewlett-Packard Co.'s Printer Command Language (PCL), arediscovering the high-quality text and graphics of PostScript as more and moreMS-DOS software packages support PostScript.andP;  As a result, many HP printerowners are looking for an inexpensive way to support their Macintoshes andMS-DOS machines, as well as their PostScript and PCL software, with oneprinter.andP;  Luckily, HP now provides an optional PostScript cartridge that canbe attached to most of its PCL printers.andM;Mitchell Tormotto, owner of Graphics Presentations Inc. of Winston-Salem,N.C., creates slides and transparencies for clients to use in presentations.andO;While he prefers working on a Macintosh for its better graphics capability,he felt compelled to start his business with a DOS machine because the textcoming from clients was usually on DOS disks.andP;  Recently he decided that formore-complex graphics work, he would import DOS files to Macintosh software.andO;Since he already had an HP LaserJet IIP, he had to add only a PostScriptcartridge, an AppleTalk interface and an additional megabyte of memory (about$1,000 total) to upgrade his printer to PostScript.andP;  The way he looks at it,his printer, which now works with both his DOS and Macintosh machines, &quot;spansthe gap between the traditional office computer (MS-DOS) and the traditionalgraphics computer (the Mac).&quot;andM;Slower, but not much.andP;  While these new low-cost printers provide PostScriptat a low cost, they often sacrifice speed.andP;  Apple's Personal LaserWriter NT,for instance, is rated at 4 pages per minute while its LaserWriter IINT israted at 8 ppm.andP;  But if you're willing to forgo Apple's rainbow logo on yourmachine, the trade-off in speed need not be so great.andP;  NEC TechnologiesInc.'s Silentwriter 2 Model 90, Texas Instruments Inc.'s microLaser PS17 andAbaton Technology's LaserScript are rated at 6 ppm.andP;  The BusinessLaserPrinter IIS from GCC Technologies Inc. is rated at 8 ppm.andM;The somewhat leisurely speed of most lower-cost laser printers will be feltmuch more by users on busy networks than single users, for whom printing isnormally a small part of the day's work.andP;  Another consideration is that ratedspeeds have to be used as a relative guide, not an absolute number.andP;  Simpletext documents normally print more quickly than graphics-laden pages.andM;What's the difference?andP;  If you've decided to buy a low-cost printer, and youcompare spec sheets, be prepared for a feeling of deja vu.andP;  While there aresmall differences between the models, as you skim the spec sheet items --number of fonts, paper-tray size, type of processor, engine manufacturer,engine life -- you find precious little on which to base a buying decision.andM;While the department manager of a Hartford, Conn.-based insurance company(who asked not to be named) may be overstating the case when he says that allthe new low-cost PostScript printers &quot;are the same under the hood,&quot; thesimilarities among the products protect against making a totally unacceptablebuying decision.andP;  When an employee at the company asks the department managerfor advice on which printer to buy, he normally says: &quot;Try out the printer;see if you like the look of the print; see if the footprint fits on yourdesk.andP;  If you buy from one of the known companies, you won't get a badmachine.&quot;andM;Conclusions.andP;  For many users, the new low-cost printers mean they no longerhave to wait on-line for high-quality text and graphics.andP;  They can have it attheir desks.andP;  Said Corning's Bradley, &quot;The closer the computer andperipherals are to me, the more productive I am.&quot;andM;Given the state of many budgets, low-cost machines have qualitatively changedthe function of PostScript laser printers, traditionally a networked machine.andO;By moving them closer to the user, they have evolved, in a sense, into a newproductivity tool.andM;While PostScript is an excellent imaging language for many reasons, it hasplayed a primary role in keeping PostScript laser printers more expensivethan those using other languages.andM;By owning and keeping its Type 1 font format secret until early this year,Adobe Systems Inc. managed to keep a virtual monopoly on PostScriptinterpreter implementations and was able to charge printer companies highprices to license PostScript.andM;But mounting pressure from PostScript-clone manufacturers that managed toduplicate the Type 1 format on their own and Apple's agreement with MicrosoftCorp. last year to exchange use of its TrueType font format for use ofMicrosoft's TrueImage PostScript clone forced Adobe to publish its fontformat early this year.andM;According to a number of printer manufacturers, this new competitiveenvironment has not been lost on Adobe, which has been offering a morefavorable pricing structure for PostScript licenses.andM;Said one vendor, &quot;Let's just say that Adobe is doing everything it can tohelp PostScript printer makers compete with the non-PostScript products.&quot;andM;Apple has since restrengthened its ties with Adobe (see MacWEEK, Sept.andP;  11),and both companies are taking pains to assure users that Type 1 and TrueTypefonts will be compatible.andM;Nevertheless, a competitive mood reigns, and you can expect prices tocontinue to drop, especially at the low end.andP;  -- By Lawrence StevensandM;Until recently, the only way to get a low-cost laser printer was to settlefor a non-PostScript machine.andP;  You can save about $1,000 by opting forQuickDraw, and with Adobe Type Manager on your Mac you can get the samehigh-quality text as on a PostScript printer.andP;  But PostScript has someadvantages over QuickDraw that may make it worth the extra cost:andM;andgt;PostScript is the de facto standard in desktop publishing.andP;  If you proofyour work on a QuickDraw printer and do final output on a PostScript device,you can't be sure the proof and the final copy will match.andM;andgt;PostScript generates far superior graphics.andM;andgt;PostScript machines are usually faster than QuickDraw printers.andP;  And becausethey have internal processors, they don't tie up your Mac as long.andM;andgt;QuickDraw laser printers can't be networked.andM;ABATON TECHNOLOGYandM;LaserScript: $2,995andM;48431 Milmont Drive, Fremont, Calif.andP;
