Researchers increasingly believe that Alzheimer's diseaseis caused by deposits in the brain of a hard, insolubleprotein that kills nerve cells. The substance, beta amyloid,is sprinkled in rope-shaped plaques in the brains of peoplewith Alzheimer's, a degenerative brain disorder responsiblefor about 100,000 deaths a year in the U.S. Biotechnologylabs and universities currently are racing to learn how braincells assemble and lay down these plaques.   Since this spring, several labs have identified naturalenzymes that snip damaging shards of the beta amyloid from alarger &quot;precursor&quot; protein normally produced by cellsthroughout the body. Scientists now think some defect inenzymes that control the brain's normal handling of thisprecursor protein causes the disease. Chemicals that suppressactivity of these &quot;scissors&quot; -- or promote other enzymes --might serve as prototypes for new drugs.   Scientists at Cephalon Inc., West Chester, Pa., recentlyidentified an enzyme dubbed &quot;clipsin&quot; that's found in higheramounts in brain samples from deceased Alzheimer's patients.A new drug might inhibit clipsin. Researchers at Athena Inc.,San Francisco, have found another enzyme, called secretase,that naturally chops up the beta amyloid. Another drug mightmimic the action of secretase.                                                                                                          Vitamin A May Assist   Fight Against Measles                                                                                                          HELP may be on the way for the recent surge in U.S.measles cases.   The Centers for Disease Control says 17,850 measles caseswere reported in the U.S. through May, a 40% increase from ayear earlier. The disease caused 41 deaths in 1989, up from35 a year earlier in the U.S., where some children in urbanareas aren't being vaccinated.   The highly contagious disease, which isn't serious formost children, is normally treated with bed rest. But severecomplications, such as pneumonia, ear infections anddiarrhea, are on the rise. The problems are even more commonoutside the U.S., where about two million children die fromthe virus each year, making measles one of the world's majorkillers.   Now doctors in South Africa are reporting that measles canbe treated with injectable doses of vitamin A, which cut therisk of death and complications in a study of 189 sickchildren. The doctors, at the University of Cape Town, foundthat among a group of children given 120 milligrams ofvitamin A, there were two deaths, while a similar groupadministered a placebo had 10 deaths. The treated group alsorecovered more quickly from pneumonia and diarrhea and spentless time in the hospital.   &quot;The results . . . indicate a remarkable protective effectof vitamin A,&quot; the researchers write in the New EnglandJournal of Medicine. Scientists suggested 50 years ago thatvitamin A might be useful against measles, but the firstclinical test came only two years ago. The new and largertest provides the confirming proof expected to changetreatment world-wide, the researchers say.                                                                                                          Another Site in Search   For Mental-Illness Gene                                                                                                          THE QUEST for genes that cause mental illnesses has turnedup a tantalizing clue.   Scottish researchers believe they've found the approximatelocation of a gene that, when damaged, may make some peopleprone to depression and schizophrenia. The finding isexpected to spur scientists engaged in a frustrating hunt forgenes. Their efforts have been dogged in the past three yearsby claims that have been questioned by subsequent findings.   In their report, researchers at Royal Edinburgh Hospitaland Western General Hospital in Edinburgh say they've found alarge family in which inheritance of a damaged bit of geneticmaterial may be responsible for an unusually high prevalenceof psychiatric disorders. The scientists discovered a strangemutation in the genetic material of 34 of 77 family members,suggesting it was passed from generation to generation.Sixteen of the 34 people with the mutation had psychiatricproblems; only five of the 43 without it had a diagnosableillness.   The scientists, led by David St Claire, wrote in theBritish journal Lancet that the mutation occurred at a spotwhere a gene might be located on chromosome 11, one of the 23matching pairs of chromosomes in every cell. The chromosome11 site is intriguing, because it's near a gene that producesdopamine, a chemical that helps nerve signals travel aboutthe brain.   Three years ago, researchers found evidence of amanic-depression gene on chromosome 11 in studies of a largeAmish family in Pennsylvania. But re-analysis of the dataoverturned that finding last year. The gene tracked by theScottish researchers is on a different side of chromosome 11.                                                                                                          Odds andamp; Ends                                                                                                          TEXAS Aandamp;M University researchers say they have produced abetter polio vaccine by modifying the polio virus. ColinYoung says he blocked the germ's tendency to mutate bytinkering with its DNA. A vaccine based on the more stablevirus won't vary from batch to batch and is less likely tocause complications sometimes tied to current vaccines, hesays. . . . U.S. Agriculture Department researchers inPeoria, Ill., say they have invented a low-cholesterol,whipped-cream topping by replacing butterfat with vegetableoils. The dessert product would come as a frozen fat-freemilk concentrate that can be thawed, flavored and whipped.Tests show it can stay foamy for 24 hours.</TEXT></DOC>
