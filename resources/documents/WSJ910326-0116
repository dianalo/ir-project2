Smith Corona said it will introduce seven machines aimedsquarely at the home-computer user, ranging in list pricefrom $1,000 to $1,900. The computers are made by Acer Inc., abig Taiwan-based PC maker that Smith Corona enlisted lastSeptember to help with its push to develop new markets.</LP><TEXT>   The new machines, which are tailored for first-timecomputer users, will be sold under a joint Smith Corona/Acerlabel. They will be distributed by Smith Corona, based in NewCanaan, Conn.   Like recent home-computing entrants by InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. and Tandy Corp., the Smith Coronamachines use industry-standard hardware and software, buthide the system's complexity under an appealing,easy-to-understand screen design. Indeed, the initial screenof Smith Corona's machines looks very similar to that of theIBM PS/1. IBM's list prices on its computers range from $1000to $2,000.   The top-of-the-line Smith Corona model, however, usesIntel Corp.'s 80386SX microprocessor chip, a more powerfulbrain than either IBM or Tandy offers. IBM is expected tointroduce a 80386SX-based version of the machine later thisyear. All the Smith Corona machines include the same softwarefound in the company's popular word processors, which maymake them attractive to word-processor users who want toupgrade to a computer.   &quot;Still, this is a very crowded market and I see a fairlytough time ahead for Smith Corona,&quot; said Anindya Bose, vicepresident of Link Resources, a market research firm. Mr. Bosesaid Smith Corona's pricing likely isn't low enough todistinguish its machines from competitors -- especiallylow-priced PC makers who offer less user-friendliness butmore features.</TEXT></DOC>
