The undersecretary of the treasury, Maurizio Sacconi, has presented to a parliamentary committee a draft proposal aimed at prohibiting insider trading. This committee will discuss the government proposal, together with numerous other parliamentary initiatives, before coming to its own recommendations on how to deal with insider trading.    Italy doesn't have a law against insider trading, which is generally considered to be a widespread practice in Italian securities trading.    Though details of the government proposal weren't immediately available, the plan generally makes stock trading on the basis of nonpublic information a criminal violation. Maximum sentence would be a prison term of as long as one year and a fine of three times the profits made through insider trading.    According to the plan, corporate executives, board members and controlling shareholders who possess secret information aren't allowed to make speculative investments in their own companies.    Professionals who, through their employment, possess information that could influence stock prices also are prohibited to buy or sell these shares.    In some cases, ministers and top government officials won't be allowed to trade securities if they have information regarding specific transactions or government contracts.    Insider information is defined as nonpublic information of a decision already made that could have an effect on the underlying stock price.    The proposal is aimed at bringing securities trading rules in line with that of the rest of European Community.    A spokesman for Consob, the stock exchange regulatory body, said he welcomes the government effort to ban insider trading. &quot;The Italian bourse is structured as a bourse of insiders,&quot; he said. &quot;If we succeed to make the stock exchange more efficient and without insider trading, we'll take a big step forward in quality.&quot;    An analyst with a Milan brokerage house also applauded the government's initiative. &quot;It's quite positive. I didn't think the government of (Ciriaco) de Mita would be so interested in this problem,&quot; he said, but added that it was only &quot;a first step&quot; in making the Italian bourse more efficient. </TEXT></DOC>
