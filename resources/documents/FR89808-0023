L. 100-690,102 Stat. 4181, November 18, 1988). The 1988 Amendments reauthorize andmodify the Federal assistance program of grants to state and local governmentsand private not-for-profit agencies for juvenile justice and delinquencyprevention improvements authorized under part B of Title II of the JJDPAct (42 U.S.C. 5611 <T3>et seq.</T3>).

These statutory changes include:A modified formula grant fund allocation minimum for participating statesand territories; a funding pass-through requirement for Indian tribes;a plan requirement related to assessing and addressing the overrepresentationof minority juveniles in all types of secure facilities; extension through1993 of the non-MSA exception to the jail and lockup removal requirement;an alternative substantial compliance standard for jail and lockup removal;and, a provision for the Administrator to waive termination of fundingeligibility for states that have failed to achieve substantial or fullcompliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement. The final regulationdetails revised procedures and requirements for states participating inthe Formula Grants Program resulting from the 1988 amendments to the JJDPAct. <ITAG tagnum="84">Description of Major Changes </ITAG>Formula Grant Allocations Section 222(a) of the JJDP Act was amended to raise the minimum FormulaGrant allocation from $225,000 per state and $56,250 per territory. Theminimum allocations are now $325,000 per state and $75,000 per territoryif the title II appropriation is less than $75 million (other than partD). If the title II appropriation is more than $75 million (other thanpart D), the minimum allocations are $400,000 per state and $100,000 perterritory. State and territory allocations will be reduced prorata to theextent necessary to ensure that no state receives less than it was allottedin Fiscal Year 1988.Indian Pass-Through Section 223(a)(5) of the JJDP Act was amended to require that a portionof each participating state's 66\2/3\ percent Formula Grant pass-throughbe made available to fund programs of Indian tribes that perform law enforcementfunctions, and that agree to attempt to comply with the deinstitutionalizationof status offenders, separation, and jail and lockup removal requirementsof the JJDP Act. The proportion of pass-through funds made available forthese programs must be the same as the proportion of the state's populationunder 18 years of age which resides in those geographical areas where Indiantribes perform such law enforcement functions. Each year, the Secretaryof the Interior will provide OJJDP with an updated list of those tribeswithin states that perform law enforcement functions. The initial listis available through OJJDP. A related provision, section 223(a)(8)(A) of the JJDP Act, was amendedto require that each state's juvenile crime analysis, which is submittedannually as part of the Formula Grant Application and Plan, include anassessment of juvenile crime problems and prevention needs within the geographicalareas in which Indian tribes perform law enforcement functions. Minority Overrepresentation in Secure Facilities Section 223(a)(23) of the JJDP Act was amended to require that each participatingstate's Formula Grant Plan address efforts to reduce the proportion ofjuveniles who are members of minority groups detained or confined in securedetention facilities, secure correctional facilities, jails, and lockups,if such proportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in thegeneral population. Jail Removal Section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act was amended to continue the non-MSA(low population density) exception to the jail and lockup removal requirementthrough 1993. The statutory criteria outlined in section 223(a)(14) (A),(B) and (C) that must be satisfied for a state to use this exception remainthe same (28 CFR 31.303(f)(4)). Section 223(c) of the JJDP Act was amended to create an alternative substantialcompliance standard for those states unable to achieve a 75 percent reductionin jail and lockup removal violations, but which have made sufficient progressto merit continued funding. The new standard establishes four criteriawhich, if satisfied, may be used in lieu of achieving a 75 percent numericalreduction to demonstrate substantial compliance. The four criteria requirethat the state has: (1) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles fromadult jails and lockups; (2) made meaningful progress in removing otherjuveniles from adult jails and lockups; (3) diligently carried out thestate's jail and lockup removal plan; and (4) historically expended andcontinues to expend an appropriate and significant share of Formula Grantresources to comply with section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act. As with the75 percent reduction standard, for a state to be eligible for a findingof substantial compliance under this alternative standard the state mustdemonstrate an unequivocal commitment to achieving full compliance withina reasonable time, not to exceed three additional years, after the December8, 1985, statutory deadline for achieving substantial compliance with thejail and lockup removal requirement. The statutory deadlines for substantial and full compliance with section223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act were not changed by the 1988 Amendments. Eachparticipating state and territory's 1987 and 1988 Monitoring Reports (dueby December 31, 1987, and December  31, 1988, respectively) must demonstrateeither substantial or full compliance with the jail and lockup removalrequirement in order for the state to be eligible (absent a waiver of termination)for the FY 1989 and 1990 Formula Grant awards, respectively. Each participatingstate and territory's 1989 Monitoring Report (due by December 31, 1989),must demonstrate full compliance or full compliance with de minimis exceptionswith section 223(a)(14) in order for the state to be eligible (absent awaiver of termination) for the FY 1991 Formula Grant award, and all subsequentawards. Section 223(c) of the JJDP Act was also amended to provide the Administratorof OJJDP with the discretion to waive termination of funding eligibilityfor those states and territories that have not achieved substantial orfull compliance with the jail and lockup removal requirement, providedthat the state or territory agrees to expend all of its Formula Grant resources,except planning and administration, advisory group set aside, and Indiantribe pass-through funds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14).This final revision of the Formula Grants Regulation sets forth standardsthat a state must demonstrate it meets in order to be considered by theAdministrator for a waiver of the termination sanction. A state which satisfiesthese standards qualifies for a waiver on the basis that: (1) It has madesignificant progress to date; and (2) additional funding is likely to producefurther progress toward compliance.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>The proposed revisions to the existing Formula Grants Regulation were publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4> on April 12, 1989 (54 FR 14768), for publiccomment. Written comments were received from eight states, two regionalcoalitions of state juvenile justice advisory groups, the National Coalitionof State Juvenile Justice Advisory Groups, the University of WisconsinSchool of Social Welfare, and the Subcommittee on Human Resources of theU.S. House of Representatives' Committee on Education and Labor. The NationalCoalition of State Juvenile Justice Advisory Groups submitted a resolutionpassed at their May 7-10, 1989 National Conference in Reno. All commentshave been considered by OJJDP in the issuance of this final regulation.The following is a summary of the comments and the responses by OJJDP:1. <T3>Comment:</T3> The majority of respondents expressed concern that paragraphs(f)(6)(iii)(D)(1)(v) and (f)(6)(iii)(D)(2) (vii) of the proposed regulationonly required states to demonstrate a ``commitment'' to achieving fullcompliance when seeking a waiver of termination of eligibility for failureto achieve substantial or full compliance with the jail and lockup removalprovision, section 223(a)(14) of the JJDP Act. These respondents indicatedthat states should be required to demonstrate an ``unequivocal commitment''to achieving full compliance in order to be eligible for a waiver of termination.The House Subcommittee on Human Resources commented that requiring a lessercommitment for a state in the context of an application for a waiver thanis required for that state to achieve substantial compliance weakens theAct's compliance scheme, which was not the intent of the l988 Amendments.The House Subcommittee further commented that only a requirement of unequivocalcommitment will enable the Administrator to make the determination, withcertainty, that additional funding is likely to produce further progresstoward compliance when waivers are granted. The comments and the resolutionof the National Coalition of State Juvenile Justice Advisory Groups supportedthis position. Several respondents commented that the positive responses of state legislaturesand governors to the requirement of an unequivocal commitment as a basisof eligibility for participation in the OJJDP sponsored Jail Removal InitiativeI demonstrates the level of commitment that most states have already madeto achieving the goals of jail removal. Within this context, respondentscommented that OJJDP should remain consistent in its interpretation ofrequirements, as weakening the standard undermines gains already achievedby many states. Finally, several respondents indicated that without requiring the higher,well defined standard of ``unequivocal commitment,'' waivers of terminationwould practically be automatic, and the jail and lockup removal provisionof the JJDP Act would be weakened. One state supported the ``commitment'' language in the proposed regulation.<T3>Response:</T3> It is the OJJDP position that the legislation itselfis clear in that it does not require the Administrator to demand an ``unequivocalcommitment'' but allows the Administrator discretion to waive terminationof eligibility when a state is unable to meet the standard for substantialcompliance, or the standard for full compliance. The Act imposes only onecondition upon the Administrator in utilizing the waiver provision: Thatthose states who are unable to demonstrate substantial or full compliance(as required by the Act) must commit all of their formula grant dollarsto the issue of jail removal except as provided by the statute. This isa substantial requirement and is demonstrative of a state's willingnessand commitment to comply with the jail removal mandate.The Regulation incorporates this requirement and in addition requires statesto: Have an adequate monitoring system, diligently carry out the state'sjail and lockup removal plan, submit an acceptable plan to eliminate noncompliantincidents and to demonstrate a commitment to achieving full compliance.Therefore, the Regulation satisfies not only the clear language of thestatute, it also satisfies the intent of Congress that the waiver be appliedto those cases where the Administrator determines the states have madesignificant progress and additional funding is likely to produce furtherprogress toward compliance. It is consistent with Congressional actionin creating the waiver provision by assisting states that are committedto maintaining progress toward and achieving full compliance with 223(a)(14).Based on these conclusions, paragraphs (f)(6)(iii)(D)(1)(v) and (f)(6)(iii)(D)(2)(vii)of the final regulation retain the original language from the proposedregulation requiring states seeking a waiver of termination of eligibilityto demonstrate a ``commitment'' to achieving full compliance. 2. <T3>Comment:</T3> One respondent indicated that there was no justificationfor allowing the Administrator to waive termination of a state's eligibilityfor failure to achieve substantial compliance with the jail and lockupremoval provision. <T3>Response:</T3> Section 223(c)(2)(B) of the JJDP Act clearly appliesthe waiver of termination sanction to those states unable to achieve substantialcompliance with the jail and lockup removal provision, pursuant to section223(c)(2)(A). This interpretation of the statute is supported by the HouseCommittee on Education and Labor Report (100-605) which states on page11, ``It should be noted that the bill makes this alternative sanctionavailable with regard to enforcing the substantial and full compliancerequirements.'' It is the OJJDP's intention to apply the waiver provision carefully, asdirected by Congress. This will occur in those situations where, althoughsubstantial compliance has not been achieved within the applicable timelimit, the state has made significant progress in removing juveniles fromadult jails and lockups, and there is substantive evidence that additionalfunding is likely to produce further progress toward full compliance. 3. <T3>Comment:</T3> One respondent requested that the waiver maximum applyonly to (f)(6)(iii)(D)(2), which relates to full compliance and not to(f)(6)(iii)(D)(1), which relates to substantial compliance. Thus the maximumnumber of waivers would only be counted for failure to achieve full compliance.Waivers applied to states for failure to achieve substantial compliancewould not be counted toward the three waiver maximum. <T3>Response:</T3> Although the standard for substantial compliance isdifferent from the standard for full compliance no other distinction ismade in the application of the three year waiver limitation. No state,regardless of whether the substantial compliance standard is used or thefull compliance standard is used, is eligible for more than three waivers.4. <T3>Comment:</T3> One respondent recommended that paragraph (j)(1), whichrequires that documentation be provided in the State Plan Juvenile CrimeAnalysis to indicate whether minority juveniles are disproportionatelydetained or confined, provide more specific information as to what kindof documentation is required. <T3>Response:</T3> OJJDP agrees with this recommendation and will preparesupplemental information, including recommended data collection and analysisstrategies. For those states whose Fiscal Year 1989 plan has already beensubmitted, separate instructions for supplementing the FY 1989 plan updateto meet any new or modified requirements imposed by the final regulationwill also be issued. 5. <T3>Comment:</T3> One respondent expressed concern about how the implementationof the workplan for addressing overrepresentation of minorities in thejuvenile justice system will be monitored to ensure that the plan is beingcarried out. <T3>Response:</T3> OJJDP intends to monitor implementation of workplansthrough site visits and through reviewing Performance Reports. In addition,OJJDP plans to develop an addendum to the Monitoring Compliance Reportwhich is currently submitted annually to determine compliance with section223(a)(12)(A), (13), and (14). This addendum will apply to the 1990 MonitoringReport due December 31, 1990, and all subsequent monitoring reports. 6. <T3>Comment:</T3> One respondent expressed concern about the interpretationof the statutory language in section 223(a)(23) of the Act that requiresstates to address the over-representation of minority youth in secure detentionfacilities. The basis for this concern is that the language ``if such proportionexceeds the proportion such groups represent in the general population,''if interpreted literally, might lead to a situation in which the proportionof minority youth in secure detention would be compared to the proportionof minority members in the general population. Such a comparison wouldbe misleading because of the skewed age distributions of minority populationsin the United States at the present. Minority populations tend to be composedof greater percentages of younger individuals. Thus, while in a given jurisdiction25 percent of the overall population may be members of a minority group,30 percent or more of the population could be under 20 years of age. Ifthis were the case, and assuming equal risks of offense, apprehension andother decision making, it would still be the case that this hypotheticaljurisdiction would appear to have an over-representation of minority youth.The respondent recommends that for purposes of determining over-representationof minority youth in secure facilities, the general population be definedas youth at risk for such confinement. <T3>Response:</T3> OJJDP also recognized the potential for misinterpretationof the statutory language. As a consequence, this language was clarifiedin andSection; 31.303 (j)(1) of the proposed OJJDP Formula Grants Regulation.This clarification has been retained in the final Regulation.7. <T3>Comment: </T3>The Subcommittee on Human Resources of the House Committeeon Education and Labor commented on the definition of Indian tribes thatperform law enforcement functions. Concern was expressed that the definitiondoes not fully track the definition of ``law enforcement and criminal justice''in section 103(6) of the Act. While the proposed definition specificallyincludes police efforts, it omits any specific reference to activitiesof courts, corrections, probation, or parole authorities. Concern was expressedthat OJJDP not interpret the term ``law enforcement functions'' too narrowlyand a suggestion made that this definition be expanded to more closelytrack the section 103(6) language. Two state respondents expressed similarconcerns. <T3>Response: </T3>In response to this comment, as well as to those fromthe two state respondents, the language for the definition of law enforcementfunctions has been expanded to include corrections, probation, and paroleactivities. 8. <T3>Comment: </T3>One state, which has only one Indian tribe that mightbe able to qualify for pass-through funds, expects that the populationunder 18 years is too small to warrant an individual grant. A questionwas raised about how OJJDP defines the term ``larger tribal jurisdiction''as it relates to that situation? <T3>Response: </T3>OJJDP recognizes the range of populations of IndianTribes and Alaskan Native villages, and the Regulation is designed to givethe State Agency flexibility in targeting funds where substantial impactcan be anticipated through the funding of tribes attempting to achievecompliance with section 223(a) (12)(A), (13) and (14) of the JJDP Act.It also recognizes the variation in resources among Indian tribes to developand manage projects, and, accordingly, provides for making pass-throughfunds available to organizations designated by tribes to represent them,or to combinations of eligible tribes. Where a state has only one tribe,that tribe, regardless of size would be the eligible tribe and would necessarilybe the recipient or beneficiary of the Indian tribe pass-through, if itmet the requirements of performing law enforcement functions and agreeingto attempt to achieve compliance with the statutory mandates. An excerpt from The U.S. Census 1980 Report on the General Characteristicsfor American Indian Persons on Reservations, which provides data on juvenilepopulations under 18 residing on Indian Reservations by state and by Indiantribe is available through OJJDP. Data on Alaskan Native Organizationsis also included. In addition, the 1980 Bureau of Census data for juvenilepopulations under 18 by state (the figure for each state is total juvenilepopulation under 18, and includes Indian juvenile population under 18),is available through OJJDP. Given the fact that the 1980 Census data onIndian tribe population is the most recent data available at this time,states are expected to use the comparable 1980 census data for the generalyouth population under 18 to compute the proportion of the pass-throughfor Indian tribes performing law enforcement functions. The Indian populationwill need to be subtracted from the total juvenile population under 18for each state. The 1980 data will be used until the 1990 Census Reportis issued and provides more current data on Indian tribe youth populations.In the event that there are Indian tribes performing law enforcement functionsthat do not appear on the Bureau of Census listing, the cognizant OJJDPState Representative should be contacted for assistance in securing otherpopulation data. 9. <T3>Comment: </T3>In the proposed regulations, numerous references aremade to Indian tribes that perform law enforcement functions. There areAlaska Natives that are recognized by the Department of the Interior ashaving law enforcement functions, and it is important that references anddefinitions include these populations. <T3>Response: </T3>In drafting this section OJJDP used the language ofthe Amendments. There is no intent to exclude any tribal unit, determinedby the Secretary of the Department of  the Interior as performing law enforcementfunctions. Moreover, section 103(18) of the 1988 Amendments defines ``Indiantribe'' as: (A) A Federally recognized Indian tribe or (B) An Alaskan Nativeorganization. The Department of the Interior provided the OJJDP with alisting that will be used to determine Indian tribe eligibility to receiveFormula Grant funds from the State agencies. Alaskan Native organizationsare included in the list. The listing is entitled, ``Indian Entities Recognizedand Eligible to Receive Services From the United States Bureau of IndianAffairs,'' published by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, U.S. Department ofthe Interior, December 29, 1988. This is the list of tribes eligible toreceive BIA services and presumed to perform law enforcement functions,pursuant to the definition provided in paragraph andSection; 31.301(b)(2)of this regulation. While this list is more encompassing than Indian tribesperforming law enforcement functions, this is the only list available fromthe Department of the Interior at this time. Thus, it will be used by StatePlanning Agencies until revised or updated by the Department of the Interior,for purposes of determining Indian tribes eligibility for the pass-through;10. <T3>Comment: </T3>One comment reflected concern about the difficulty indefining tribes that perform law enforcement functions.<T3>Response:</T3> Section 103(6) of the Act provides the definition oflaw enforcement and criminal justice for the purposes of OJJDP programs.This definition includes those activities that impact on section 223(a)(12)(A),(13) and (14). Section 223(a)(5) designates the Secretary of the Departmentof the Interior as the authority for determining which tribes perform lawenforcement functions using this definition. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 </ITAG>This notice does not constitute a ``major'' rule as defined by ExecutiveOrder 12291 because it does not result in: (a) An effect on the economyof $100 million or more, (b) a major increase in any costs or prices, or(c) adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity,or innovation among American enterprises. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This final regulation, does not have a ``significant'' economic impacton a substantial number of small ``entities'', as defined by the RegulatoryFlexibility Act (Pub.

To the extent necessary, each stateand territory's base allocation will be reduced proportionately to ensurethat no state receives less than it was allocated in Fiscal Year 1988.(b) <T3>Funds for Local Use.</T3> At least two-thirds of the formula grantallocation to the state (other than the section 222(d) State Advisory Groupset aside) must be used for programs by local government, local privateagencies, and eligible Indian Tribes, unless the State applies for andis granted a waiver by the OJJDP. The proportion of pass-through fundsto be made available to eligible Indian tribes shall be based upon thatproportion of the state youth population under 18 years of age who residein geographical areas where tribes perform law enforcement functions. Pursuantto section 223(a)(5)(C) of the JJDP Act, each of the standards set forthin paragraphs (b)(1) (i) through (iii) of this section must be met in orderto establish the eligibility of Indian tribes to receive pass through funds:(1)(i) The tribal entity must be recognized by the Secretary of the Interioras an Indian tribe that performs law enforcement functions as defined inparagraph (b)(2) of this section. (ii) The tribal entity must agree to attempt to comply with the requirementsof section 223(a)(12)(A), (13), and (14) of the JJDP Act; and(iii) The tribal entity must identify the juvenile justice needs to beserved by these funds within the geographical area where the tribe performslaw enforcement functions. (2) ``Law enforcement functions'' are deemed to include those activitiespertaining to the custody of children, including, but not limited to, policeefforts to prevent, control, or reduce crime and delinquency or to apprehendcriminal and delinquent offenders, and/or activities of adult and juvenilecorrections, probation, or parole authorities. (3) To carry out this requirement, OJJDP will annually provide each statewith the most recent Bureau of Census statistics on the number of personsunder age 18 living within the state, and the number of persons under age18 who reside in geographical areas where Indian tribes perform law enforcementfunctions. (4) Pass-through funds available to tribal entities under section 223(a)(5)(C)shall be made available within states to Indian tribes, combinations ofIndian tribes, or to an organization or organizations designated by suchtribe(s), that meet the standards set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) (i)-(iii)of this section. Where the relative number of persons under age 18 withina geographic area where an Indian tribe performs law enforcement functionsis too small to warrant an individual subgrant or  subgrants, the statemay, after consultation with the eligible tribe(s), make pass-through fundsavailable to a combination of eligible tribes within the state, or to anorganization or organizations designated by and representing a group ofqualifying tribes, or target the funds on the larger tribal jurisdictionswithin the state. (5) Consistent with section 223(a)(4) of the JJDP Act, the state must providefor consultation with Indian tribes or a combination of eligible tribeswithin the state, or an organization or organizations designated by qualifyingtribes, in the development of a state plan which adequately takes intoaccount the juvenile justice needs and requests of those Indian tribeswithin the state. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>3.

(C) Full compliance with de minimis exceptions is achieved when a statedemonstrates that it has met the standard set forth in either of paragraphs(f)(6)(iii)(C) (<T3>1</T3>) or (<T3>2</T3>) of this section: (<T3>1</T3>) <T3>Substantive De Minimis Standard.</T3> To comply with this standardthe state must demonstrate that each of the following requirements havebeen met: (<T3>i</T3>) State law, court rule, or other statewide executive or judicialpolicy clearly prohibits the detention or confinement of all juvenilesin circumstances that would be in violation of section 223(a)(14); (<T3>ii</T3>) All instances of noncompliance reported in the last submittedmonitoring report were in violation of or departures from, the state law,rule, or policy referred to in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C)(<T3>1</T3>)(<T3>i</T3>) of this section; (<T3>iii</T3>) The instances of noncompliance do not indicate a patternor practice but rather constitute isolated instances; (<T3>iv</T3>) Existing mechanisms for the enforcement of the state law,rule or policy referred to in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C)(<T3>1</T3>)(<T3>i</T3>) of this section are such that the instances of noncomplianceare unlikely to recur in the future; and (<T3>v</T3>) An acceptable plan has been developed to eliminate the noncompliantincidents and to monitor the existing mechanism referred to in paragraph(f)(6)(iii)(C)(<T3>1</T3>)(<T3>iv</T3>) of this section. (<T3>2</T3>) <T3>Numerical De Minimis Standard.</T3> To comply with this standard thestate must demonstrate that each of the following requirements under paragraphs(f)(6) (iii)(C)(<T3>2</T3>) (<T3>i</T3>) and (<T3>ii</T3>) of this section have been met: (<T3>i</T3>) The incidents of noncompliance reported in the state's lastsubmitted monitoring report do not exceed an annual rate of 9 per 100,000juvenile population of the state; (<T3>ii</T3>) An acceptable plan has been developed to eliminate the noncompliantincidents through the enactment or enforcement of state law, rule, or statewideexecutive or judicial policy, education, the provision of alternatives,or other effective means. (<T3>iii</T3>) Exception. When the annual rate for a state exceeds 9 incidentsof noncompliance per 100,000 juvenile population, the state will be consideredineligible for a finding of full compliance with de minimis exceptionsunder the numerical de minimis standard unless the state has recently enactedchanges in state law which have gone into effect and which the state demonstratescan reasonably be expected to have a substantial, significant and positiveimpact on the state's achieving full (100%) compliance or full compliancewith de minimis exceptions by the end of the monitoring period immediatelyfollowing the monitoring period under consideration. (<T3>iv</T3>) Progress. Beginning with the monitoring report due by December31, 1990, any state whose prior full compliance status is based on havingmet the numerical de minimis standard set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C)(<T3>2</T3>)(<T3>i</T3>) of andSection; 31.303, must annually demonstrate, in its requestfor a finding of full compliance with de minimis exceptions, continuedand meaningful progress toward achieving full (100%) compliance in orderto maintain eligibility for a continued finding of full compliance withde minimis exceptions. (<T3>v</T3>) Request Submission. Determinations of full compliance and fullcompliance with de minimis exceptions are made annually by OJJDP followingsubmission of the monitoring report due by December 31 of each calendaryear. Any state reporting less than full (100%) compliance in any annualmonitoring report may request a finding of full compliance with de minimisexceptions under paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(C) (<T3>1</T3>) or (<T3>2</T3>) of this section. The request may be submitted in conjunctionwith the monitoring report, as soon thereafter as all information requiredfor a determination is available, or be included in the annual state planand application for the state's Formula Grant Award. (D) <T3>Waiver.</T3> (<T3>1</T3>) Failure to achieve substantial compliance as defined in thissection shall terminate any state's eligibility for Formula Grant fundsunless the Administrator of OJJDP waives termination of the state's eligibility.In order to be eligible for a waiver of termination, a state must submita waiver request which demonstrates that it meets the standards set forthin paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(D)(<T3>1</T3>) (<T3>i</T3>)-(<T3>v</T3>) of this section: (<T3>i</T3>) Agrees to expend all of its Formula Grant Award except planningand administration, advisory group set aside, and Indian-tribe pass-throughfunds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14); and (<T3>ii</T3>) Diligently carried out the state's jail and lockup removalplan as set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A)(<T3>2</T3>)(<T3>iii</T3>) of this section; and (<T3>iii</T3>) Submitted an acceptable plan, based on an assessment of currentjail and lockup removal barriers within the state, to eliminate noncompliantincidents; and(<T3>iv</T3>) Achieved compliance with section 223(a)(15) of the JJDP Act;and (<T3>v</T3>) Demonstrates a commitment, through appropriate executive orlegislative action, to achieving full compliance. (<T3>2</T3>) Failure to achieve full compliance as defined in this sectionshall terminate any state's eligibility for Formula Grant funds unlessthe Administrator of OJJDP waives termination of the state's eligibility.In order to be eligible for this waiver of termination, a state must requesta waiver and demonstrate that it meets the standards set forth in paragraphs(f)(6)(iii)(D)(<T3>2</T3>) (<T3>i</T3>)-(<T3>vii</T3>) of this section: (<T3>i</T3>) Agrees to expend all of its Formula Grant Award except planningand administration, advisory group set aside, and Indian tribe pass-throughfunds, to achieve compliance with section 223(a)(14); and (<T3>ii</T3>) Removed all status and nonoffender juveniles from adult jailsand lockups as set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A)(<T3>2</T3>)(<T3>i</T3>) of this section; and (<T3>iii</T3>) Made meaningful progress in removing other juveniles fromadult jails and lockups as set forth in paragraphs (f)(6)(iii)(A)(<T3>2</T3>)(<T3>ii</T3>) of this section; and (<T3>iv</T3>) Diligently carried out the state's jail and lockup removalplan as set forth in paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(A)(<T3>2</T3>)(<T3>iii</T3>) of this section; and (<T3>v</T3>) Submitted an acceptable plan, based on an assessment of currentjail and lockup removal barriers within the state, to eliminate noncompliantincidents; and (<T3>vi</T3>) Achieved compliance with section 223(a)(15) of the JJDP Act;and (<T3>vii</T3>) Demonstrates a commitment, through appropriate executiveor legislative action, to achieving full compliance. (E) Waiver Maximum. A state may receive a waiver of termination of eligibilityfrom the Administrator under paragraph (f)(6)(iii)(D) (<T3>1</T3>) and (<T3>2</T3>) of this section for a combined maximum of three Formula GrantAwards. No additional waivers will be granted. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(g) Juvenile Crime Analysis. Pursuant to section 223(a)(8) (A) and (B),the state must conduct an analysis of juvenile crime problems, includingjuvenile gangs that commit crimes, and juvenile justice and delinquencyprevention needs within the state, including those geographical areas inwhich an Indian tribe performs law enforcement functions. <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(j) Minority Detention and Confinement. Pursuant to section 223(a)(23)of the JJDP Act, states must address efforts to reduce the proportion ofjuveniles detained or confined in secure detention facilities, secure correctionalfacilities, jails and lockups who are members of minority groups if suchproportion exceeds the proportion such groups represent in the generalpopulation, viz., youth at risk for secure confinement. It is importantfor states to approach this in a comprehensive manner. Compliance withthis provision is achieved when a state has met the requirements set forthin paragraphs (j) (1)-(3) of this section: (1) Provide documentation in the State Plan Juvenile Crime Analysis toindicate whether minority juveniles are disproportionately detained orconfined in secure detention or correctional facilities, jails, or lockupsin relation to their proportion of the at risk youth population; (2) Where documentation is unavailable, or demonstrates that minoritiesare disproportionately detained or confined in relation to their proportionin the at risk youth population, states must provide a strategy for addressingthe disproportionate representation of minority juveniles in the juvenilejustice system, including but not limited to: (i) Assessing the differences in arrest, diversion, and adjudication rates,court dispositions other than incarceration, and the rates and periodsof commitment to secure facilities of minority youth and non-minority youthin the juvenile justice system; (ii) Increasing the availability and improving the quality of diversionprograms for minorities who come in contact with the juvenile justice systemsuch as police diversion programs; (iii) Providing support for prevention programs in communities with a highpercentage of minority residents with emphasis upon support for community-basedorganizations that serve minority youth; (iv) Providing support for reintegration programs designed  to facilitatereintegration and reduce recidivism of minority youths; (v) Initiate or improve the usefulness of relevant information systemsand disseminate information regarding minorities in the juvenile justicesystem. (3) Each state is required to submit a supplement to the l988 Multi-YearPlan for addressing the extent of disproportionate representation of minoritiesin the juvenile justice system. This supplement, which will be submittedas a component of the 1989 Formula Grant Application and Multi-Year PlanUpdate, must include the state's assessment of disproportionate minorityrepresentation, and a workplan for addressing this issue programmatically.Where data is insufficient to make a complete assessment, the workplanmust include provisions for improving the information collection systems.The workplan, once approved by OJJDP, is to be implemented as a componentof the state's 1990 Formula Grant Plan. (4) For purposes of this plan requirement, minority populations are definedas members of the following groups: Asian Pacific Islanders; Blacks; Hispanics;and, American Indians. (k) Pursuant to section 223(a)(24) of the JJDP Act, states shall agreeto other terms and conditions as the Administrator may reasonably prescribeto assure the effectiveness of programs assisted under the Formula Grant.  <ITAG tagnum="6">Terrence S.
