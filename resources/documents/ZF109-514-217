(product introduction).andO;Ticker:    CS.andO;Product:   Cabletron Systems Multi-Media Access Center (Network hub)(Equipment and supplies).andO;Topic:     Fiber Distributed Data Interface StandardProduct IntroductionInterfaceBridges (Connector)SpecificationsInterOpEthernet.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Only three weeks after introducing the local area networking (LAN) industry'sbroadest Token Ring product line, Cabletron Systems Inc., plans to unveil itsinitial entry into the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) market.andM;Cabletron plans to unveil iIts Ethernet to FDDI (EFDMIM) bridging module forthe Multi Media Access Center (MMAC) intelligent wiring hub by connecting twoCabletron Ethernet networks via the main FDDI ring formed by 37 majornetworking vendors of the FDDI Solutions Showcase Demonstration Group at theupcoming Interop show in San Jose.andM;In a January 1990 report from Forrester Research Inc., the average per portcost for FDDI (including fiber optic adapters, hubs, cables and connectors)was reported as $11,650.andP;  Forrester estimates this figure will drop to $2,000by 1994, but Cabletron expects it will drop even further if a twisted pairstandard is approved in the interim.andM;Cabletron believes that the increasing speeds and complexity of today'snetworks will fuel demand for FDDI bandwith in the workplace.andP;  Thus FDDI willbecome a very popular technology over the next two to three years and fullyexpects it to share significant portions of the market with Ethernet andToken Ring by 1994, if not sooner.andM;The EFDMIM will support dual attached connection for the MMAC intelligentwiring hub using a media scheme developed for the MMAC platform throughCabletron's Integrated Network Architecture.andP;  The Integrated NetworkArchitecture is a product strategy which provides a standards-based frameworkfor seamless network evolution and expansion as customer needs grow, or asnew networking technologies enter the market.andM;The MMAC platform, through an innovative, three-tiered backplane known as theFlexible Network Bus (FNB), allows Ethernet, Token Ring and FDDI technologiesto coexist within a single modular hub.andM;The EFDMIM receives Ethernet packets from one network and transfers themalong an FDDI ring to another Ethernet network on the ring.andP;  The bridgecontains extensive filtering databases and source learning to control dataflow and unnecessary bandwidth consumption in an Ethernet environment.andM;The EFDMIM supports Cabletron's Remote LANVIEW network management and has thecapability to monitor network statistics and traffic rates.andP;  The EFDMIM iscompliant with FDDI standards, American National Standards Institute (ANSI)X3T9.5 standards and SMT 6.2 (station management) standards.andP;  The bridge isalso protocol independent.andM;General availability of the EFDMIM bridge is expected to begin in 60 days.andO;The bridge is priced at $19,995.andM;Key Executive: Michael Welts, marketing manager at Cabletron.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
