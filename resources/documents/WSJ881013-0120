Sundstrand, an aerospace and industrial parts concern, could be barred from receiving military contracts for as long as three years as a result of the plea, Defense Department officials said. Justice Department officials said a related investigation of individual Sundstrand employees is continuing. That investigation, which may result in criminal charges or further guilty pleas, should be completed within 60 to 90 days, officials said.    In a separate action in federal court in Seattle, the company agreed to plead guilty to one count of overbilling on government contracts by its Sundstrand Data Control Inc. unit in Redmond, Wash., and to pay $12.3 million to settle that case.    Sundstrand also disclosed yesterday it is the subject of additional contracts disputes that aren't connected with either the Chicago or Seattle cases. The amount the government might accept to resolve these other disputes may exceed the reserves Sundstrand has set up in anticipation of penalties and legal fees; settlement of the additonal disputes &quot;could have a materially adverse impact on earnings,&quot; the company said.    In the plea agreement filed in U.S. District Court here, Sundstrand admitted to billing the government &quot;millions of dollars&quot; for such &quot;unallowable&quot; expenses as baby-sitting, saunas, golf, movies and dog kennels as well as servants for Sundstrand executives and snow-plowing at executives' homes.    The Rockford, Ill., concern also admitted to concealing that it had provided wine, liquor and meals as well as tickets to the theater and sporting events for Defense Department employees and their spouses in order to &quot;improve (its) ability to market its products to the Defense Department.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sundstrand's stock closed at $53.125, up 12.5 cents.    The company did not issue its statement on the additional contract disputes until after the market closed.    The Chicago plea agreement also says Sundstrand concealed millions of dollars in cost overruns on various design and development contracts, and then improperly billed those costs to the government as overhead. Sundstrand also devised a scheme to allow it to take tax write-offs on bogus losses, the agreement says.    The charges in the Chicago action cover the period between February 1980 and January 1987. Sundstrand is expected to formally file a guilty plea by Oct. 21, according to Anton R. Valukas, U.S. attorney for Northern Illinois, who oversaw the two-year investigation. A federal judge must approve the plea agreement before it can be finalized, Mr. Valukas said.    Mr. Valukas said the Sundstrand case is one of the first defense work fraud cases to result in a guilty plea. &quot;An attitude has prevailed among defense contractors that these matters would be solved (by merely reimbursing the government). We sought to change that attitude and make believers of them,&quot; he added.    The settlements in the Chicago and Seattle cases were expected. Earlier this year, the company said it had set aside $130 million in anticipation of the penalties. As a result, it cut its forecast of 1988 earnings to $31.5 million, or $1.70 a share, from $77.5 million, or $4.20 a share.    Sundstrand is to pay $82 million of the settlement within five days of entering its guilty plea, the agreement says. It is to make annual payments of $11 million over the next three years.    Sundstrand also agreed to fire any employees found guilty of criminal actions and cooperate with continuing investigations. It recently placed two vice presidents on leave and reassigned a third in connection with the criminal case.    Despite these problems, industry analysts had remained bullish on the stock because of the growth foreseen in Sundstrand's commercial aircraft parts business. Commercial aerospace sales were $416.9 million in 1987. Military sales amounted to $574 million last year.    The company declined to comment on whether its earnings projections will have to be adjusted again. In a prepared statement, it said it has taken steps to insure future compliance with government regulations and that it is hopeful the contract disputes still pending will be resolved.    Those contracts disputes involve the company's alleged failure to comply with federal cost accounting procedures and acquisition regulations.    Taken together, the Chicago and Seattle cases are bound to provide a shot in the arm to Justice Department efforts to root out fraud and improper charges by major defense contractors. The plea agreements also could help deflect election-year criticism of the Reagan administration's accomplishments in this area.    Prosecutors said the next-largest settlement of alleged overcharges by a defense contractor involved Textron Inc.'s Bell Helicopter division, which earlier this year signed an agreement requiring it to pay $69 million for allegedly overcharging the Army for some labor costs and helicopter parts.    Some estimates peg the value of that civil settlement at around $90 million, after the company provides the Army with certain parts held in inventory and forgoes some payments. Textron didn't face criminal charges in that case and didn't acknowledge any impropriety.    Sundstrand supplies the military with a variety of parts, including mechanical and fluid pump systems and engine start systems for such aircraft as the F-14 and F-18. It makes speed brakes, rudder controls and various actuation systems for the space shuttle, and produces ground proximity and wind shear warning devices for commercial aircraft.    ---   Andy Pasztor in Washington also contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
