The bid would top a $75-a-share, or $17.6 billion, offer that is being contemplated by a management group led by F. Ross Johnson, RJR's president and chief executive officer.    Even the lower offer would result in the largest business transaction ever.    Executives of Atlanta-based RJR, reached last night, said they didn't know of any competitive offer by Kohlberg and wouldn't comment.    The Kohlberg offer is conditioned on approval by RJR's board. The Wall Street sources said Kohlberg had been in contact with RJR executives about a possible joint bid for the company before the RJR offer was unveiled last week. But RJR declined to involve Kohlberg and pursued a bid of its own that Kohlberg believes is undervalued, the sources said. A Kohlberg official declined to comment last night.    The question now is whether the group led by Mr. Johnson can come back to top Kohlberg Kravis, probably at a price that would have to be about $20 a share above the group's originally contemplated price. The group's bid is to be financed by Shearson Lehman Brothers, which is also putting up some of the money for that transaction. Another question is at what price this transaction stops being financially feasible.    At $75 a share, the contemplated offer was already about triple the size of the previously biggest leveraged buy-out ever, and some people familiar with RJR's operations have said they thought it would take very favorable asset sales and operating results to make it work at that price.    Prior to this transaction, the largest leveraged buy-out was a $6.2 billion buy-out of Beatrice Cos. by Kohlberg in 1986.    Kohlberg may be attracted in part because RJR is set up in a number of separate operating companies that could be easily sold off. Those include its Del Monte and Nabisco Foods operations, both domestic and international, and its tobacco business.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, RJR's stock closed at $76.75 a share, down 37.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
