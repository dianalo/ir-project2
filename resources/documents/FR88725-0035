The assessment provides a basisfor the conclusion that the field testing of these genetically engineeredtomato plants does not present a risk of plant pest introduction or disseminationand also will not have any significant impact on the quality of the humanenvironment.

The rule regulates the introduction(importation, interstate movement, and release into the environment) ofgenetically engineered organisms and products which are plant pests orwhich there is reason to believe are plant pests (regulated articles).The rule sets forth procedures for obtaining a permit for the release intothe environment of a regulated article and for obtaining limited permitsfor the importation or interstate movement of a regulated article. A permitmust be obtained before a regulated article can be introduced in the UnitedStates.APHIS has stated that it would prepare environmental assessments and, wherenecessary, environmental impact statements prior to issuing a permit forthe release into the environment of a regulated article (see 52 FR 22906).E. I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Company, Inc. of Wilmington, Delaware, hassubmitted an application for a permit for release into the environmentof genetically engineered tomato plants that are designed to be tolerantto sulfonylurea herbicides. In the course of reviewing the permit application,APHIS assessed the impact to the environment of releasing the tomato plantsunder the conditions described in the Du Pont application. APHIS concludedthat the field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introductionor dissemination and will also not have any significant impact on the qualityof the human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact whichis based on data submitted by the E. I. Du Pont de Nemours andamp; Company,Inc., as well as a review of other relevant literature, provides the publicwith documentation of APHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impactsassociated with conducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene which has the effect of making a tomato plant tolerant to theeffect of sulfonylurea herbicides has been inserted into a tomato chromosome.In nature, the genetic material contained in a chromosome can only be transferredto another sexually compatible plant by cross-pollination. In this fieldtest trial, the introduced gene cannot spread to any other sexually compatibleplant by cross-pollination because the test plot is located at a sufficientdistance from any sexually compatible plant with which these experimentaltomato plants could successfully cross-pollinate.2. Neither the acetolactate synthase (ALS) gene itself, nor its derivedgene product confers on tomato any plant characteristic. Traits such asweediness are polygenic and cannot be conferred by adding a single herbicidetolerance gene. The experimental tomato plants will remain sensitive toa wide range of other herbicides which could be used to kill these plants.3. The tobacco variety from which the ALS gene was obtained is not a plantpest.4. The ALS gene does not provide the genetically engineered tomato plantswith any measurable selective advantage over nongenetically engineeredtomato plants in its ability to be disseminated or to become establishedin the environment.5. The vector used to transfer the ALS gene into a tomato chromosome hasbeen evaluated for its use in this experiment. The vector, although derivedfrom an original wild-type Ti plasmid with known plant pathogenic potential,has been disarmed; that is, phytohormone genes which are necessary to conferplant pathogenic traits have been removed from the vector. The vector hasbeen tested and shown to be not pathogenic to any susceptible plant.6. The vector agent, the phytopathogenic bacterium which was used to deliverthe vector encoding the ALS gene into a tomato plant cell, has been demonstratedby <T3>in vitro </T3>and <T3>in vivo </T3>assays to be eliminated and no longer associated withany genetically engineered tomato plant, plant part, or seed.7. Horizontal movement by infectious transfer or transposition of any introducedgene or DNA sequence is not known to be possible. The vector acts by deliveringthe gene to the tomato genome where it is stably inserted into the tomatochromosomal DNA. The vector cannot replicate independently of its vectoragent and does not survive alone in any plant. No mechanism of horizontalmovement is known to exist in nature to move an inserted gene from a chromosomeof a genetically engineered plant to any other organism.8. Sulfonylurea herbicides are a new class of herbicide noted for theirhigh herbicidal activity at very low use rates, excellent crop selectivity,and low mamalian toxicity.9. The size of the enclosed field test trial plot is amll (35 feet by 110feet). Physical isolation of the test site will be provided by a 12-foot-high,chain-link fence surrounding the entire research farm.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact has beenprepared in accordance with (1) the National Environmental Policy Act of1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>); (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (Title 40, Code of FederalRegulations (CFR) Parts 1500-1508); (3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA(7 CFR Part 1b); and (4) APHIS Guidelines Implementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384and 44 FR 51272-51274).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, this 20th day of July 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Larry B.
