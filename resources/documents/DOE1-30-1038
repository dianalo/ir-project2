<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>The introduction of new power station technologies, such as for instancepressure-charged fluidized-bed firing or the combined gas turbine/steamturbine process, calls for the development of highly efficient systemsfor cleaning dustladen gases in a temperature range of about 1000/sup0/C. Filtering dust separators are gaining more and more significancefor such cases of application. By the use of silicon-carbide filtershigh degrees of dust separation are attainable in this range of temperature.In a experimental plant of laboratory scale filter disks made of silicon-carbidehave been tested, and the first results on two of such filter samplesare described below.</TEXT></DOC>
