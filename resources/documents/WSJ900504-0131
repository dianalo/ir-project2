BMW set up the deal by first arranging to acquire thesmall jet-engine unit of Kloeckner-Humboldt-Deutz AG, theWest German engineering group that has been spinning offsecondary operations to focus on consolidating its corebusiness. Called KHD Luftfahrttechnik G.m.b.H., the unit had1989 sales of 180 million marks ($106.7 million) and suppliesengine components for the multination Airbus commercialairliner and Tornado jet-fighter programs. The company willbe folded into the BMW-Rolls-Royce venture, to be based atKHD Luftfahrttechnik's plant near here.</LP><TEXT>   BMW and Rolls-Royce said in a joint statement yesterdaythat BMW will hold a 50.5% stake in the new venture withRolls-Royce retaining the remaining 49.5%. Financialarrangements weren't disclosed. The joint venture willcollaborate with Rolls-Royce Tay and Trent engine programs.In addition, it will serve as the vehicle to jointly designand develop new engines with less than 20,000 pounds ofthrust for emerging lines of smaller airliners.   BMW officials say the engine venture is a base from whichto build a larger operation as the demand for short- andmedium-haul aircraft increases. The ongoing deregulation ofthe European airline industry is allowing smaller airlineswith smaller airplanes to enter a marketplace where customersincreasingly prefer direct routings to smaller cities.   &quot;Our estimation is that both partners will invest as muchas a billion marks in the venture over the next 10 years,&quot;said a BMW source.   Rolls-Royce, which has 50 licensing and cooperationagreements world-wide, described the step as strengtheningits position in the European jet-engine market. Broaderlink-ups between the two companies aren't planned. &quot;BMW andRolls-Royce got together to run this company, that's it,&quot;said a Rolls-Royce spokesman.   Rolls-Royce, a major player in the market for jet engines,receives a cash-rich partner after BMW enjoyed years ofstrong profit growth on sales of its popular luxury cars.   Analysts put BMW's net cash position, or liquid assetsafter accounting for debt, at 2.2 billion marks. BMW's jetengine venture surprised many analysts. Indeed, BMW ChairmanEberhard von Kuenheim has often asserted that BMW didn't feelcompelled to diversify because of strategies of other automakers, an apparent gibe at arch-rival Daimler-Benz AG andits problems with achieving the desired synergy among itsvaried operations.   &quot;We had wondered what it was going to do with all thatcash, but this comes unexpected,&quot; said Stephen Reitman, anautomobile analyst for UBS-Phillips andamp; Drew. &quot;But it raisestheir profile and gives them a foot in the door in apotentially high-growth market.&quot;   Separately, Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz said yesterday itagreed to spin off its Deutz-Allis Corp. farm-machinerysubsidiary to the U.S. division's management and anunidentified &quot;financial group.&quot;   Financial details and the identity of the U.S. financialgroup were not disclosed.   Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz acquired Deutz-Allis in 1985. Thefarm-equipment maker had sales of $307 million last year.   The company operates a sales and service network through700 dealers in the U.S. and Canada. It also makescrop-harvesting combines at a complex in Independence, Mo.   Since 1987, Kloekner-Humboldt-Deutz said, Deutz-Allis hasfollowed a strategy of operating in niches of the tractormarket to avoid the negative impact of the fiercelycompetitive farm equipment industry.</TEXT></DOC>
