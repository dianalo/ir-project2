Manuel Noriego would be treated as any othercriminal defendant _ ``no more, no less,'' said the federal judgehandling the ousted Panamanian leader's drug trial.   But 80 miles to the north, in West Palm Beach, another federaljudge on Wednesday postponed the cocaine importation trial of threemen after agreeing with defense attorneys' contention that the triocould not receive a fair trial because of the U.S. military actionin Panama.   Noriega and 16 associates face federal drug-traffickingindictments returned last year by grand juries in Miami and Tampa.   ``If General Noriega is apprehended and brought here fortrial,'' U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said Wednesday,``he would be given the same treatment as any other person accusedof a crime _ no more, no less.   ``All his rights will be protected,'' the Miami trial judge saidin the February 1988 Miami indictment against Noriega.   In West Palm Beach, Judge James C. Paine postponed the trial oftwo U.S. citizens and a Colombian national charged with smugglingmore than 25 pounds of cocaine into south Florida.   Paine agreed with defense arguments that accused drugtraffickers cannot receive a fair trial when the United States hasjust invaded a country to apprehend someone accused of the samecrime.   Paine said it might be ``difficult, if not impossible, to get ajury seated that would give (the three) a fair trial.''   Noriega remained at large today. The United States has issued a$1 million reward for information leading to his arrest. If he iscaught, federal officials confirmed that extremely tight securityhas been included in plans drawn up to handle his arrival.Officials spoke on the condition of anonymity.   After being flown to an unspecified military base in southFlorida, Noriega would be transferred to a ``secure location'' toawait the Miami trial, according to an official for the U.S.Marshals Service.   Two Noriega attorneys in Miami said if their client wascornered, he would rather die than surrender.   ``He's a fighter,'' said Miami attorney Raymond Takiff. Theattorney said he last spoke with Noriega Monday evening, andremained in touch with the general's aides on Wednesday.   Attorney Frank Rubino agreed.   ``The general is alive, well and somewhere in Panama,'' Rubinosaid, ``and he is on top of the situation, as far as leading hisforces.''   Noriega is charged in the indictments with accepting bribes of$10 million from drug traffickers of Colombia's Medellin Cartel toprotect smugglers and cocaine shipments, launder cash and supplydrug laboratories.   If convicted, he faces up to 145 years in prison and more than$1.1 million in fines.</TEXT></DOC>
