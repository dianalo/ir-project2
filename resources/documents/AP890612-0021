An investigation by a special prosecutor produced enough evidenceto charge Jose Antonio Zorrilla Perez with the killing of ManuelBuendia, who frequently criticized the government in his front-pagecolumn in the newspaper Excelsior.   Zorilla, 49, headed the Federal Security Department from 1981 tomid-1984. He met with Buendia three times in the month before theslaying, including the night before the fatal shooting, the Union ofDemocratic Journalists says.   Buendia's slaying in a parking garage in Mexico City had been oneof the country's most prominent unsolved crimes.   The government news agency Notimex said police searched Zorilla'shome in a wealthy neighborhood in the southern part of the capitallate Sunday but he was not yet under arrest.   Authorities had named Zorrilla as a suspect as early as January1988. In recent weeks, he has been widely mentioned in news reportsas the principal suspect.   Miguel Angel Garcia Dominguez, the special prosecutor in thecase, says testimony in the past two months led investigators toconclude that Zorrilla was responsible for the killing.   Although never charged, Zorrilla had been linked to Mexicannarcotics kingpins including Rafael Caro Quintero, who is accused inthe 1985 torture and killing of U.S. narcotics agent EnriqueCamarena.   Caro Quintero fled the western city of Guadalajara in a privatejet two days after Camarena's abduction there, allegedly with policecredentials and while police stood by. He is serving a 34-yearsentence on drug and other charges and awaiting disposition of thehomicide case.   Zorilla also has been mentioned in news reports in connectionwith the deaths of three policemen and an investigator.   He was suspended from the security post in mid-1984 and in 1985was dropped as a congressional candidate for the governingInstitutional Revolutionary Party amid reports that he was underinvestigation.   The security department, an investigative agency similar to theFBI, was later abolished.   Earlier, Zorrilla was private secretary to Fernando GutierrezBarrios, deputy interior secretary at the time and now thesecretary. He held political posts in the northern state of Hidalgoand served a term in Congress.   Garcia Dominguez gave no details of the evidence that linkedZorrilla to Buendia murder case.   However, the Union of Democratic Journalists, an organization ofliberal journalists, said in late May that their investigation foundBuendia had been followed by the agents of Zorrilla's department formore than three months before the May 30 killing, the magazineProceso said last month.   Buendia wrote about sensitive issues most other columnistsavoided: the clergy, right-wing paramilitary groups, officialsinvolved in drug dealing, weapons trafficking and the complicity ofauthorities in contraband.   He wrote a book, ``The CIA in Mexico,'' published in 1983, andoften criticized U.S. policy in Central America and elsewhere.   Journalists have alleged political interference has delayed theinvestigation of Buendia's killing.   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari promised during a PressFreedom Day luncheon on Thursday to continue investigating the case.</TEXT></DOC>
