Senators voted 66-32 to block an amendment, offered by freshmanSen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., which would weaken the administration'scontrol over a new Resolution Trust Corp. for disposing of anestimated $400 billion of real estate expected to fall into thegovernment's hands because of Sandamp;L failures.   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., not a member of the committee,pleaded with colleagues to vote on the amendment based on itsmerits.   ``The banking committee is not the fountain of all wisdom. Tosuggest that the document is sacred and every word is infallible... well, we just may as well go home now,'' he said.   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., one of the banking panel's seniormembers, told senators they could be accommodated when the billreaches a House-Senate conference, but for now he said, ``It's abetter bill than the House bill and I think we ought to leave italone.''   Revenues from the sale of the real estate are to be used toreduce the taxpayers' costs from the bailout, expected to totalsome $200 billion over the next 30 years.   President Bush wanted the new agency to be run under athree-member board made up of Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady,Attorney General Dick Thornburgh and Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan.   The Senate Banking Committee expanded the board to include twobusinessmen to be appointed by Bush. Kerrey wanted to expand theboard to seven members and give its chairman the power to name hiscolleages while weakening the status of Brady, Thornburgh andGreenspan by making them ex-officio members.   Because the board will have control over the greatestconcentration of land, buildings and real estate ever amassed inthe nation's history, the potential for scandal is unprecedented,Kerrey said.   However, the banking committee's chairman, Sen. Donald W. RiegleJr., D-Mich., and ranking Republican, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah,opposed Kerrey's amendment, saying it would put too much control inprivate interests.   ``It goes further than we ought to go at this time,'' Rieglesaid.   Leaders want the bill passed by Wednesday and Senate MajorityLeader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has threatened to call senatorsback to work Friday, in the middle of the Passover recess, if theymiss the deadline.   ``The bill is a carefully crafted compromise,'' Garn said.``Extraneous and controversial amendments could upset that balanceand lead us into bickering and delays we simply cannot afford.''   In most respects, the legislation tracks the proposal presentedin February by Bush, pledging $157 billion to the problem over thenext 10 years and providing a smorgasbord of reforms, chief amongthem a requirement that Sandamp;L owners back their lending with more oftheir own capital.   Most changes in the president's plan were crafted by thecommittee behind closed doors, then ratified in a public sessionlast Thursday. And despite the plea for fast action, severalsenators, both on and off the committee, are seeking another crackat further amending the plan.   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., a committee member, said he would offeran amendment scrapping the administration's proposal for keeping$50 billion of the spending out of the budget deficit.   Graham maintains that including the spending in the budget willreduce the government's cost of borrowing the money.   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, is examining a variety ofamendments, including measures requiring institutions to cashgovernment checks, offer low cost checking accounts to poor people,and disclose their record of lending to poor and minorityneighborhoods. He is also considering a measure repealing specialtax benefits designed to encourage purchase of failed Sandamp;Ls.   Other senators who may offer changes include:   _Sen. Larry Pressler, R-S.D., who would give small, solvent Sandamp;Lsmore time than other Sandamp;Ls to meet capital requirements.   _Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who would force large banks to payinsurance premiums on deposits from foreigners. Even though thosedeposits are not technically insured, they are usually protectedbecause regulators have a policy of keeping big banks afloat ratherthan closing them.   Meanwhile, three consumer groups _ the Consumer Federation ofAmerica, Consumers Union and the Association of CommunityOrganizations for Reform Now _ castigated both the House and Senateversions as providing loopholes in what appear to be tough capitalrequirements.   The groups particularly criticized the Senate bill for allowingSandamp;Ls 25 years to remove goodwill from their books. Goodwill, whichis not permitted to banks, represents the value assigned byaccountants of an institution's value as a going concern. Itdisappears when an institution fails and is liquidated.   ``Unfortunately, the talk on Capitol Hill is much tougher thanthe bills that are rapidly moving through the House and Senate,''said Michelle Meier, an attorney with Consumers Union.</TEXT></DOC>
