(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   First lady Barbara Bush urged graduatesof tiny Bennett College on Sunday to heed the example set by 19thcentury black activist Frederick Douglass and help people``enslaved by ignorance'' to become educated members of society.   ``Someday in your lives, the walls will part and you'll see alittle Frederick Douglass,'' Mrs. Bush said in a commencementaddress at the predominantly black, liberal arts college for women.   ``I hope that you will remember the abiding principles andvalues that we learned when we were young and I hope you will say,`I want to be fair and I want to share.' It can be done and I wantto help you do it.''   Mrs. Bush was awarded an honorary doctorate of humane letters bythe college, which was founded in 1873. In her speech, saidDouglass had been one of her heroes since she read theautobiography of the one-time slave who became a scholar and writer.   She said she was particularly struck by Douglass' account ofoverhearing his owner admonishing his wife not to teach slaves howto read because doing so would make them impossible to control.   ``Frederick Douglass' revelation holds true today,'' Mrs. Bushsaid. ``There are many types of slavery, and education is the keyto freedom.''   The first lady, who is active in literacy programs and ishonorary chairperson of the National Advisory Council of LiteracyVolunteers of America, challenged the 92 graduates to ``help theyoung, modern Frederick Douglasses out there today who are enslavedby ignorance. Help them learn their A-B-C's and escape,'' she said.   The ceremony was held beneath overcast skies on the school'sgrassy quadrangle, lined with oak trees.   Mrs. Bush walked at the rear of the procession, wearing a blackacademic gown and cap and a triple trand of pearls. As sheapproached the dais, a child handed her a dozen red roses.   Mrs. Bush, the mother of five and grandmother of 11, said herhonorary doctorate was ``a wonderful Mother's Day present for me.''Her speech was laced with jokes about children, but she said thebasic lessons learned in early childhood form the basis of adultcharacter.   She also challenged the graduates to follow the example ofDorothy Brown, who despite being an orphan, graduated from BennettCollege in 1941 and went on to become a surgeon and Tennesseelegislator. She quoted Mrs. Brown as having said, ``I haven'taccepted defeat, not my entire life.''   The speech was the only commencement address Mrs. Bush willdeliver this year, according to press secretary Anna Perez. Thefirst lady chose to accept Bennett's invitation because she met thecollege's president, Gloria R. Scott, in a White House Rose Gardenceremony earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
