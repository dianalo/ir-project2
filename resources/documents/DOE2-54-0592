The reportopens with a history of the Alberta Energy Resources Conservation Board,which was founded in 1938 in order to encourage resource development,protect the public interest, and ensure resource conservation. A majororiginal concern was the waste of gas flared from early oilfield developments,and starting from the regulation of the petroleum and natural gas industriesthe Board has expanded to include oil sands, coal, pipelines, hydroelectricity,and power generation and transmission. The report continues with a summaryof Alberta's energy reserves, mainly oil and gas, examining how muchof these reserves have been developed, produced and marketed, and howmuch is left for the future. Data are also presented on energy sales,investment, and employment in the energy sector. Alberta's energy end-userequirements are then presented; Canada continues to rely on Albertafor a major portion of its total energy production, and is expected tocontinue to do so in the future. However, the pattern of oil productionwill change, with conventional oil expected to decline, and syntheticcrude and bitumen to increase. The report concludes with a summary ofoperations of the Energy Resources Conservation Board, including a discussionof environmental issues related to oil and gas production. 42 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
