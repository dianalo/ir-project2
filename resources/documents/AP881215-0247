The shark-proof cable that went into service Wednesday can carry40,000 phone calls simultaneously, double the capacity of all itstrans-Atlantic copper-cable predecessors combined, even though itmeasures less than an inch across.   Isaac Asimov, the prolific author of science and science fiction,spoke the first official words on the cable in a three-way videoconference connecting New York, London and Paris.   ``Welcome, everybody, to this historic trans-Atlantic crossing _this maiden voyage across the sea on a beam of light,'' Asimov saidat 10:30 a.m. EST in the first words spoken over the new cableexcept for test messages.   In a sign of the voracious demand for communications, thepartners in the $361 million project expect the new fiber-opticcable to start running out of room by late in 1991. That's when anew cable with even more capacity will go into service.   Fiber-optic service to Japan and the Far East will start nextspring, and other undersea fiber links will reach to the Caribbeanand the Mediterranean by the early 1990s.   For residential customers, the new cable, TAT-8, will mean acontinued decline in the price of calls trans-Atlantic calls. Forbusinesses, it will mean lower rates and more capacity for the hugevolume of computer data they transmit, especially in the areas offinance, travel and tourism.   Ordinary television broadcasts still will be carried by satellitebecause they would take up too much room on the cable. But thecable's builders expect the cable to be used for video conferencesbetween offices, with the signals compressed to take up less room.   Lasers have revolutionized phone networks by making it possibleto transmit information in the form of rapid pulses of laser lightthrough hair-thin strands of glass known as optical fibers. Thelasers transmit information in digital form, that is, coded into aseries of ones and zeros.   Most long-distance calls within the United States already arecarried on optical fibers.   The new cable contains six strands of glass, and two of them arespares. The cable measures 0.8 inch across, except for the sectionsthat are reinforced against shark bites, which are 1.3 inches across.   The first undersea phone cable between the United States andEurope, TAT-1, was built in 1956 and could handle 36 simultaneouscalls. During its entire 22-year lifetime it handled 10 millioncalls. TAT-8 (the TAT rhymes with `cat') can handle that many callsin less than two days.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. owns 34.1 percent of TAT-8,British Telecom owns 15.5 percent and France Telecom owns 9.8percent. All three of those companies sent cable-laying ships toshare in the effort. The rest of TAT-8 is owned by 27 othertelecommunications administrations and companies.   In spite of the huge capacity of fiber-optic cables, ATandamp;T saidthere is still a role for satellites, and it recently signed acontract with Communications Satellite Corp. expanding its use ofsatellites. A Comsat spokesman, Richard McGraw, said other companiessuch as MCI Communications Corp. and US Sprint Communications Co.also had signed long-term contracts for satellite usage.   The cable touches ground in North America at Tuckerton, N.J.; inthe United Kingdom at Widemouth in North Cornwall; and in France atPenmarch in Brittany. It is buried a yard beneath the ocean floor toa depth of about 3,000 feet so it will not be snagged by fishingvessels. It is clad in steel to a depth of 8,500 feet to protectagainst shark bites.   ATandamp;T said 1988 would be the first year the company handled morethan 1 billion calls into and out of the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
