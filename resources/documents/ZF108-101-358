(portrait)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Dennis EskowandM;For buyers tired of going to one reseller for software, another for hardwareand then using precious staff time to set it all up, Jeffrey Zonenshine hassome good advice.andM;He forged a partnership between two resellers, who now work together todeliver, set up and support ready-to-run PCs.andM;&quot;Bringing the two vendors together has resolved problems with a minimum ofresources,&quot; said Zonenshine, the associate director of end-user computing atJoseph E. Seagrams andamp; Sons Inc., the New York-based beverage manufacturer.andM;&quot;We're getting quick upgrades and an amazing amount of service.&quot;andM;Under the program, when a Seagrams manager wants a system, a purchase orderis submitted to the purchasing department, which then contacts CorporateSoftware Inc. in Westwood, Mass., for the software and Tec Computer ProductsInc. in New York for the hardware.andM;Corporate Software sends the appropriate package to Tec Computer Products,which then sets up the system at the Seagrams site.andM;Once the system is up and running, end users can call Seagrams' informationcenter for help with problems.andP;  If the center can't handle a call, Tec hastwo full-time employees at Seagrams who can provide answers.andM;As a last resort, either Seagrams' support professionals or Tec's personnelat the Seagrams sites have access to Corporate Software's help lines.andM;&quot;All the end user wants to know is, how are you going to fix my problem?&quot;andO;Zonenshine said.andM;&quot;And they're getting good answers under this program.andP;  My help-desk peoplehave more time to work on business issues.&quot;andM;The vendors are also delighted with the outcome.andM;According to market analyst Ted Richardson of investment bank Richardson,Schwering, Bolton Inc. in Ft.andP;  Lee, N.J., software vendors traditionally haveattributed about 10 percent of their revenue to hardware products, whilehardware retailers have attributed about 5 percent of their revenue tosoftware.andM;&quot;I give up something, the hardware guy gives up something, and we both have ahappy customer,&quot; said Vince Kelly, executive vice president of sales andmarketing for Corporate Software.andM;&quot;This is another facet in the trend started by Kodak when it out-sourcedcomputer services,&quot; Kelly said.andP;  &quot;We expect to see a lot of corporationsdoing this in the future -- putting vendors together in combinations thatmake sense to the customer.&quot;andM;Despite the fact that stationing two people at Seagrams cuts down on TecComputer's profit in that relationship, company officials say it was astrategically important move.andM;&quot;We are establishing our support expertise with a very important customer,&quot;said David Chen, president of Tec.andP;  &quot;Seagrams has just opened a new ISdepartment in Westchester County, and we think our track record will bring usnew business there.&quot;andM;Since going to work with Corporate Software, Tec has joined with investmentfirm Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. and publishing giant Random House Inc.andO;in similar partnerships.andM;&quot;It makes absolute sense to assemble your vendors at a table and make themwork together,&quot; said Zonenshine.andP;  &quot;They want your business, and you need themto shore up your support.andP;  It's classical win-win.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
