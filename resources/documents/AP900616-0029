The emulsion sinks and is consumed bymarine life. Microbes die when they cannot find any more oil to eat.   USES: The microbes have been used for years to clean uphazardous waste sites, treat sewage and wastewaters, and extractoil from tight geologic formations. They were used to clean somerocks on shore after the Exxon Valdez accident last year in Alaska.Their use off Texas was the first time bioremediation has been usedin the water to clean up an oil spill.   PLAN: State officials mixed the bacteria in 100-gallon tanks ofsalt water and shot it through hoses from a Coast Guard cutter.   AMOUNT: Officials planned to use 100 pounds of the bacteria eachday for three to four days on freshly spilled oil near the vessel.   COST: The test will cost the state about $50,000.</TEXT></DOC>
