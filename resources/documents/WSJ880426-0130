The diversified high-technology concern's profit for the quarter ended April 1 was $9.4 million, or 43 cents a share, compared with $3.9 million, or 18 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 25% to $299 million from $239.5 million.    Varian had an $8.2 million loss for the first six months of fiscal 1988, reflecting a $22.8 million first-quarter charge for restructuring and cost-reduction moves. Year-earlier profit was $11.8 million, or 55 cents a share. Sales in the latest first half rose 24% to $564 million from $454 million a year earlier.    The semiconductor operation, benefiting from lower expenses and higher prices, had its first quarterly profit since 1985, Varian said. The group had large pretax losses in each of the past two years, but Varian expects a profit this year. First-half orders were 60% higher than a year earlier, spurred by Far East demand, Varian said.    Varian added that the company's other operating groups showed &quot;generally good performance,&quot; and that its analytical instrument and cancer therapy equipment operations had markedly improved sales and orders.    Varian shares closed yesterday at $26.875, off 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
