The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency lodged a complaint andproposed a $5,000 fine against Thornton Township High School inHarvey, a spokeswoman said Friday. It is the first complaint theEPA has brought under new asbestos-safety rules that went intoeffect in December.   The complaint says students and other school personnel wereexposed to asbestos fibers during the improper removal of 6,400square feet of hallway flooring.   ``We had received several calls from teachers and students andactually the workers in the school that the tile was being removedin the hallway and clouds of dust were being raised, and they werevery concerned about it,'' said EPA spokeswoman Nancy Sullivan.   School officials have until July 11 to respond to the complaint,which names Thornton High School District 205. The school wasclosed Friday afternoon, and officials could not be reached forcomment.   The violations were discovered during an EPA inspection March 1,and the school immediately discontinued the flooring removalproject at the agency's request, the EPA said.   Asbestos, a mineral that has been used in building materials,can cause lung cancer and other disorders when airborne fibersenter the body.   When the tile was removed in February, school officials did notinitially know that it contained asbestos, Ms. Sullivan said.Later, officials had the tile tested and the presence of asbestoswas confirmed, she said.   Workers who were not accredited by the government to removeasbestos ``had sanded, chipped and cut the tiles, releasing cloudsof dust containing asbestos,'' the EPA said in a news release.   The complaint against Thornton is the EPA's first enforcementaction nationwide under the Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act,the agency said.   Under the law, which took effect Dec. 14, specific safetymeasures must be taken when removing asbestos from elementary andsecondary schools.   If they decide to contest the complaint, school officials canseek an informal hearing with EPA officials in Chicago or request ahearing before a federal administrative law judge, Ms. Sullivansaid.</TEXT></DOC>
