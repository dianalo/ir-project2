The group, led by New Jersey investor David F. Bolger, wants shareholder approval to force out Cleveland-Cliffs' board. It said it won proxies from holders of more than 25% of the outstanding common and preferred shares, the amount needed to call a special meeting.    The Bolger group said it made a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in which the group said if it wins the contest, its slate of directors will seek advice from investment bankers on whether to sell all or part of the company. The group owns about 7.4% of Cleveland-Cliffs outstanding common shares.    Officials at financially troubled Cleveland-Cliffs said they hadn't yet received copies of the SEC filing and couldn't comment.    In a letter to Cleveland-Cliffs shareholders, Mr. Bolger said he believes that the company's &quot;financial problems have a better chance for resolution if the company is private rather than public.&quot; He indicated that his group also is exploring methods by which they may take the company private themselves.    But the group said it hasn't been able to obtain financing for a tender offer, leveraged buy-out or other transaction because it doesn't have the cooperation of the company's management. Cleveland-Cliffs is a producer of iron ore that also has timber, coal mining and oil drilling operations.    The turmoil at Cleveland-Cliffs erupted earlier this year when the company proposed a public offering of four million shares of common stock and said it would adopt a shareholders rights plan. The stock offering was proposed as part of a restructuring of about $126 million of long-term debt of the Tilden Mine, a Michigan iron ore mine that is 39%-owned by Cleveland-Cliffs.    Mr. Bolger, who maintains that the stock offering and rights plan are &quot;imprudent, unnecessary and solely intended to entrench management,&quot; tried unsuccessfully to block the offering and the rights plan in federal court.    In the first half of 1987, Cleveland-Cliffs had a loss of $27 million on revenue of $230.2 million.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Clveland-Cliffs shares closed at $17.50, down 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
