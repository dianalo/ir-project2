Democratic presidential front-runner Michael Dukakis could gainmore from improved U.S. Soviet relations than Vice President GeorgeBush, the all-but-certain Republican presidential nominee, thescholars said.   But if that happens, it would be only the second time since 1952that the foreign policy issue has played into the hands of theDemocrats, William A. Galston and Christopher J. Makins wrote in thelead article in the summer issue of Foreign Policy magazine.   The other campaign was in 1964, when Lyndon B. Johnsonsteamrollered Barry Goldwater in part with a famous daisy-petaladvertisement and ``Moscow calling'' line portraying theconservative Republican as a war-mongerer.   Galston is a Democrat who was issues director for Walter Mondalefrom 1982 to 1984 and who worked briefly as an adviser to Sen.Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., when Gore sought the Democraticnomination. Makins is an independent and former director ofinternational security programs for the Roosevelt Center forAmerican Policy Studies. Galston is also a former Roosevelt Centerscholar.   ``The history of modern presidential elections suggests that theRepublican candidate will be well advised to stress foreign policy,while his Democratic counterpart should seek to focus publicattention on domestic concerns,'' they wrote.   ``Concerns about U.S.-Soviet relations and arms control havereceded in the face of the dramatically improved atmosphere and thesolid progress at the negotiating table. The public is now moreworried about terrorism, the spread of nuclear weapons to countriesthat do not now have them, possible conflict in the Persian Gulf,and the U.S. trade imbalance,'' they said. ``Demands for betterburden sharing with Western Europe and Japan have become staples ofthe 1988 campaign rhetoric.''   If the foreign policy debate focuses on these issues, ``Democratsmay have an opportunity to offset the advantage Republicans haveenjoyed on more traditional foreign policy issues.''   Opinion polls and scholarly studies have concluded that Americanvoters are swayed less by foreign policy concerns than by domesticissues, especially the state of the economy.   But Galston and Makins said foreign policy can be ``crucial atthe margin, where it counts the most.''   ``Foreign policy is, first and foremost, a prism through whichvoters judge the basic soundness of a candidate to govern thecountry,'' they said.   Even though the Iran-Contra affair weakened public confidence inthe Republicans' stewardship of foreign affairs, polls still givethe Republicans an edge in this arena, the authors said.   The article says both Bush and Dukakis could be saddled withparty platforms that turn voters off.   In 1984, ``archconservative forces seized control of theRepublican platform process and drafted a document not entirely tothe White House's liking, especially with its allusions to fightingand winning nuclear wars,'' it said.   The Democrats face the prospect that Jesse Jackson and hissupporters will fight for platform stands on military spending, armscontrol and the Middle East that ``might well antagonize swingvoters whose support will be critical to Democratic general electionprospects.''   In 1984, the article notes, three of the five contestedDemocratic platform planks dealt with foreign policy issues:Jackson-sponsored minority reports on defense spending cuts and anuclear no-first policy, and a Gary Hart push for stringent limitson committing U.S. troops to combat.   ``The picture that emerged was of a liberal party significantlydivided on foreign policy and at risk of being tugged even furtherto the left,'' the article said.   Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor with no foreign policyexperience, ``has faithfully represented the views of post-VienamDemocrats who are skittish about the use of American force, opposedto much of this decade's military buildup,'' it said.   Such a stance ``has not fared well among conservative Democratsand independents in past general elections,'' the authors said.   Bush, former CIA director and envoy to China, may be able toargue that Reagan's military build-up and Strategic DefenseInitiative have brought the Soviets back to the bargaining table and``dissuaded the U.S.S.R. from advancing in the Third World.''   But Bush's ties to Reagan also leave him ``in a relatively weakposition to exploit the electorate's frustration over trade, theinternational drug trade, the U.S. `decline' overseas and theallies' perceived failure to contribute fairly to the commondefense,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
