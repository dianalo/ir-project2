Dr. Ibrahim Majid Al-Shaheen, an architect who headsKuwait's Emergency Recovery Program, said that of 171contracts signed so far, 70% are with U.S. companies. Hewouldn't identify them.</LP><TEXT>   Dr. Al-Shaheen said the emergency purchases are the firststage of a two-phase recovery program being designed by ateam of Kuwaiti professionals that could cost billions ofdollars, depending upon an assessment of the damage thecountry has suffered.   Current estimates for emergency needs, he said, assumethat electrical power, water and telephone systems have beenlargely destroyed and that food and medical supplies areexhausted. The emergency contracts are being designed torestore those systems and items for the first 90 days afterallied forces have ousted Iraqi troops.   &quot;A lot of companies have approached us,&quot; he said, notingthat the Kuwaitis prefer to make their initial contracts withsuppliers who have off-the-shelf equipment used by Kuwait inthe past.   The first goal, he said, is to supply vital services tothe 800,000 people currently living in Kuwait. Once that isachieved, he said, then other residents and citizens ofKuwait will be invited to return from exile.</TEXT></DOC>
