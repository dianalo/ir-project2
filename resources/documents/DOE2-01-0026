Ventilation scintigraphy was used in some patients withequivocal findings at the other examinations. Perfusion scintigraphyand DSA was evaluated independently first and then together for establishmentof a consensus of which diagnosis was correct. Eighteen of the 40 patientswere diagnosed to have lung emboli. Scintigraphy and DSA were in accordin 75% of the patients. A positive predictive value 0.77 was found forscintigraphy and 1.0 for DSA while negative predictive value was 0.94and 0.85 respectively. The cause of the lower negative predictive valuefor DSA was poor image quality due to lacking patient cooperation.</TEXT></DOC>
