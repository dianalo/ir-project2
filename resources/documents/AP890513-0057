Student leader Wang Dan of Beijing University said studentsstill may be in the square on Monday when Soviet President MikhailGorbachev arrives for the first Sino-Soviet summit in three decades.   ``As for whether we will disrupt Mr. Gorbachev's visit to China,that depends on the government,'' Wang said.   He said he hoped Gorbachev would tell Chinese leaders about his``good experience'' in political reform. However, he said he didn'texpect the students to have a chance to talk to Gorbachev.   He added, ``Mr. Gorbachev's visit to China is a state affair.I'm sure he won't come to Tiananmen Square to get involved inChinese politics.''   Student leaders also said that on Friday night, in a majorconcession, the government agreed to hold talks with an independentstudent group on the student demands for sweeping democraticreforms and an end to official corruption.   ``But they made certain conditions,'' said Wang Chaohua, agraduate student at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.   ``They said the number of (student) delegates could not exceed20'' and reporters would be allowed to issue only partial reportson the talks. The students are demanding that the talks bebroadcast in full.   Miss Wang said the students were not satisfied with the offer.The offer nevetheless is a major concession because the governmentpreviously had insisted that all talks be held throughgovernment-sponsored student unions.   Thousands of passers-by crowded the square for a look at theprotest, which marked the eighth time students have marched toTiananmen since they began a campaign for political change on April15.   Students from more than a dozen schools sat in neat rows on thevast square, the symbolic center of power in China. Some hadcanteens of water, others sat on blankets. Several read the worksof Indian leader Mohandas K. Gandhi, famed for his fasting andnon-violent opposition to British colonial rule.   About three rows of student surrounded the strikers, protectingthem from onlookers.   Meanwhile, another group of students went to the Soviet Embassyand delivered an open letter in Russian inviting Gorbachev to speakat Beijing University. Student leader Zhang Jun said students hadcollected 6,000 signatures.   Emerging from the embassy, Zhang said the Soviets told him theywould give the letter to Gorbachev but that his schedule was verytight.   Gorbachev's four-day visit, which begins Monday, will mark thefirst time a Soviet leader has come to China in 30 years. Studentsalso are planning a demonstration to ``welcome'' the Sovietpresident on Monday.   In a related matter, the Foreign Ministry said today that U.S.warships scheduled to make a port call at Shanghai on Friday, oneday after Gorbachev is to visit the city.   Earlier, U.S. sources said the ships would arrive on Thursday.Foreign diplomats in Beijing said the Soviet side was unhappy aboutthe naval visit, which the Soviets saw as a signal by China thatbetter Sino-Soviet relations would not influence China's stronglinks with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
