Daoud Daoud, the top military commander of the mainstream ShiiteAmal militia in south Lebanon, also that the kidnapping waswell-planned in advance but that a series of snags slowed down theabductors' flight, giving Amal time to seal the area.   He said he believes Lt. Col. William R. Higgins still is insouth Lebanon, although he was kidnapped Wednesday.   ``We have arrested several accomplices, but the leader of thekidnap operation has left the south,'' Daoud told The AssociatedPress in an interview at his home in Bedias, seven miles northeastof Tyre.   ``We know them all by name now, and we believe (Lt.) Col.Higgins is still in south Lebanon,'' he said.   Amal militiamen and U.N. peacekeeping troops have sealed off a300-square-mile area around Tyre, searching through cave-strewnvalleys and olive and citrus groves.   Higgins, 43, heads a 76-man unarmed U.N. observer team thatmonitors border violations of a 1949 armistice agreement betweenLebanon and Israel.   The group is attached to the 5,800-member U.N. Interim Force inLebanon, or UNIFIL, deployed in 1978 after an Israeli incursioninto south Lebanon.   The pro-Iranian Organization of the Oppressed on Earth on Fridayclaimed responsibility for Higgins' abduction, accusing him ofbeing a CIA spy. American and U.N. officials denied the charge.   The Pentagon said Higgins, of Danville, Ky., had been a juniormilitary aide to former U.S. Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinbergerbut that his abduction did not pose a major security risk to theUnited States.   The first claim of responsibility for the kidnapping cameThursday in a call from an anonymous man claiming to speak for apreviously unknown group, the Islamic Revolutionary Brigades.   ``We believe Higgins is still in south Lebanon because theaccomplice who was assigned to transport him to Beirut after theabduction is detained by us,'' Daoud said, refusing to identify anyof the suspects or their affiliations.   Security sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said manyof the 40 men detained have links to the Iranian-backed Hezbollah,or Party of God, an umbrella organization for Shiite extremists.   Hezbollah's Voice of Islam radio station, based in Baalbek, ineast Lebanon, claimed today that 150 Hezbollah members were roundedup in house raids in the Tyre region.   ``Amal's men have stormed Hezbollah's operations center in thesouth, seized documents, equipment and cameras. They also raidedthe house of Hezbollah's south Lebanon leader Abbas Musawi,'' theradio said. It made no mention of Higgins.   Daoud said Higgins' abduction was ``carefully thought out,planned and staged.''   He said among the detainees were those assigned to monitorHiggins' movements, and ``they have confessed that they knew fourdays in advance that he was coming to Tyre on Wednesday.''   Higgins was driving from Tyre to UNIFIL headquarters in theborder town of Naqoura when gunmen in a brown Volvo car blocked thehighway and seized him.   ``The kidnappers ran into a chain of snags after the abduction.Their first car, the brown Volvo, got stuck in the mud. They made abulldozer driver push them out, but the exhaust was broken and theyhad to move Higgins to a white Peugeot,'' Daoud said.   ``This (second) car collided with a truck loaded with orangessoutheast of Tyre. The kidnappers then moved Higgins to a redMercedes and fled to their unknown hideout,'' Daoud added.   ``These snags cost the kidnappers about 1{ hours, during whichwe managed to seal off all exits from Tyre region south of theLitani River,'' Daoud said.   He said the mastermind had sent four other brown Volvo carsspeeding through several neighboring villages.   ``He wanted to shake off any pursuers. However, the accidentsgave us the needed time to seal off the area,'' Daoud said.   ``I am 60 percent certain that Higgins is still south of theLitani. It is very difficult for them to smuggle him out on footthrough the valleys. Nevertheless, we're keeping this in mind,'' headded.   UNIFIL spokesman Timur Goksel today said: ``We are maintainingroad checks and heavy emphasis on collection of information. Webelieve he is probably still south of the Litani,'' Goksel said.   In Washington, President Reagan said Thursday that the UnitedStates will not withdraw Americans from the U.N. observer group,despite the abduction. Fifteen other nations contribute to the unit.   In its type-written Arabic statement, the Organization of theOppressed on Earth said Higgins is ``one of the biggest spiesplanting daily terror in our land.''   The statement was delivered to a Western news agency in Beirut,accompanied by photocopies of two identity cards of Higgins.   The group, believed made up of Shiite zealots, previously hasclaimed responsibility for hijackings, bombings and the abductionof 12 Lebanese Jews. It has claimed to have killed eight of theJews kidnapped in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
