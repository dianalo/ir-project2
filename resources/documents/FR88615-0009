Introduction </ITAG>A. Test Rule Development Under TSCA This final rule is part of the overall implementation of section 4 of TSCA(Pub. L. 94-469, 90 Stat. 2003 et seq., 15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.), whichcontains authority for EPA to require the development of data relevantto assessing the risk to health and the environment posed by exposure toparticular chemical substances or mixtures (chemicals). Under section 4(a) of TSCA, EPA must require testing of a chemical to develophealth or environmental data if the Administrator makes certain findingsas described in TSCA under section 4(a)(1) (A) or (B). Detailed discussionsof the statutory section 4 findings are provided in the Agency's firstand second proposed test rules which were published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> of July 18, 1980 (45 FR 48510) and June 5, 1981(46 FR 30300). B. Regulatory History Section 4 of TSCA authorizes EPA to require testing of chemicals whosemanufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use, or disposal maypresent an unreasonable risk of injury to human health or the environmentbut for which existing data are inadequate to reasonably determine or predictsuch effects. EPA's Office of Solid Waste (OSW) identified a need for health effectsand/or chemical fate data on 73 chemicals in support of its effort undersection 3001 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) to identifythose wastes which may pose a substantial hazard to human health and theenvironment if improperly managed. Those chemicals were the subject ofa proposed TSCA section 4 test rule (May 29, 1987; 52 FR 20336) that includedtesting for chemical fate and/or human health effects. The proposed rule containing an overview of the Solid Waste Disposal Act(SWDA), as amended by RCRA, background on EPA's concentration-based listingprogram under RCRA, a discussion of EPA's TSCA section 4(a) findings, andproposed test standards to be used, including a provisional anaerobic biodegradationtest guideline designed by EPA and proposed for comment. Testing is not being required or recommended at this time for the 40 chemicalslisted in the following Table 1, for one or more of the following reasons:(1) There is insufficient economic information available to perform anadequate economic analysis for the chemical (e.g., the chemical may notcurrently be in production); (2) the proposed testing was scientificallyinappropriate because of the chemical's physical properties and/or chemicalfate; and/or (3) there is no available information in the three data basessearched by OSW to suggest a potential for exposure to the chemical.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Chemicals for which testing was proposed, but is not being requiredor recommended at this time</T4><H1/>Chemical name <H1/>CAS No.<ITAG tagnum="1">Acetamide,N-(aminothioxomethyl) \1\ \3\ <D>591-08-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ammonium vanadate \3\ <D>7803-55-6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Benzal chloride \2\ <D>98-87-3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>p</T3>-Benzoquinone \3\ <D>106-51-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2,2'-Bioxirane \1\ \3\ <D>1464-53-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromoacetone \1\ \3\ <D>598-31-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1-Bromo-4-phenoxy benzene \1\ \3\ <D>101-55-3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Carbonyl fluoride \2\ \3\ <D>353-50-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chloral \2\ \3\ <D>75-87-6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2-Chlorobenzotrichloride \1\ \2\ \3\ <D>2136-89-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">2-Chloroethyl vinyl ether \1\ <D>110-75-8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlornaphazine \1\ \3\ <D>494-03-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1-(<T3>o</T3>-Chlorophenyl)thiourea \1\ \3\ <D>5344-82-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cyanogen bromide \3\ <D>506-68-3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Daunomycin \1\ \3\ <D>20830-81-3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>o,o</T3>-Diethyl-<T3>S</T3>-methyldithiophosphate \1\ \3\ <D>3288-58-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>a,a</T3>-Dimethylphenethylamine \3\ <D>122-09-8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">4,6-Dinitro-<T3>o</T3>-cyclohexylphenol \1\ \3\ <D>131-89-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethylene-bis-dithiocarbamic acid \1\ \3\ <D>111-54-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Glycidylaldehyde \1\ \3\ <D>765-34-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexachlorophene \3\ <D>70-30-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hexaethyl-tetra-phosphate \1\ <D>757-58-4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Isosafrole \3\ <D>120-58-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Maleic anhydride \2\ <D>108-31-6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methacrylonitrile \3\ <D>126-98-7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Methyl chlorocarbonate \3\ <D>79-22-1</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1-Naphthylamine \3\ <D>134-32-7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nicotine \3\ <D>54-11-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Paraldehyde \3\ <D>123-63-7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phenacetin \3\ <D>62-44-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">n-Phenylthiourea \3\ <D>103-85-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phosgene \2\ <D>75-44-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1-Propanamine \3\ <D>107-10-8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Propanenitrile \3\ <D>107-12-0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Propanenitrile, 3-chloro \1\ \3\ <D>542-76-7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Saccharin \3\ <D>81-07-2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tetraethyldithiopyrophosphate \1\ \3\ <D>3689-24-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Thiosemicarbazide \1\ \3\ <D>79-19-6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">o-Toluidine hydrochloride \1\ \3\ <D>636-21-5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trypan blue \3\ <D>72-57-1</D><F> \1\ \2\ \3\ Refers to reasons 1, 2, and 3, stated in the previous paragraph,why testing is not being required or recommended at this time.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Response to Public Comments </ITAG>Thirty-three sets of written comments pertaining to chemicals subject tothis final rule were submitted to EPA (Refs. 1 through 33) by the closeof the extended comment period (August 27, 1987). A public meeting wasalso requested by the Chemical Manufacturers Association (CMA) and washeld on September 9, 1987. The comment period was reopened for an additional30 days on January 14, 1988 to allow time to review additional supportdata inserted into the public docket. Additional written comments (Refs.38 through 44, and 49) were received during this time. The commenters who responded to this proposed rulemaking fall into thefollowing categories: Chemical and/or petroleum producers, trade associations,universities and research centers, Federal and State government organizations,and a public interest group. Comments relevant to chemicals subject tothis final rule are discussed below, and divided into four categories:General issues, chemical-specific issues, response to technical commentson the proposed anaerobic biodegradation test guideline, and economic issues.A. General Issues 1. <T3>Use of TSCA section 4 to obtain data for a RCRA program. </T3>The Procterand Gamble Company in its comments (Refs. 23 and 50) stated its supportfor EPA's goal of determining appropriate levels at which the land disposalof the listed chemicals should be regulated, but believes that the Agency'suse of section 4 of TSCA to accomplish the goal is inappropriate. Its beliefis based primarily on the fact that the subject chemicals are listed onAppendix VIII of 40 CFR Part 261, a Part that governs the disposal of hazardouswaste under RCRA and has no direct relationship to TSCA. EPA, CMA (Ref. 2), and the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC; Ref.20), however, disagree with Procter andamp; Gamble Company on this use ofTSCA section 4. CMA believes that EPA should consider the toxicities ofthe constituent chemicals in making specific relisting decisions, and recognizesthat ``the Agency might issue TSCA section 4 testing requirements as oneof the means to obtain such toxicity data.'' NRDC believes that EPA clearlyhas the authority to issue a test rule covering groups of chemicals underTSCA section 4, and considers this test rule ``a long overdue and welcomeapplication of this authority.'' EPA agrees with CMA and NRDC on this issue and notes, as NRDC did in theircomments, that TSCA was enacted in 1976 to fill in some of the regulatorygaps that then existed regarding the assessment and prevention of adversehealth and environmental effects from potentially toxic substances. Thistest rule therefore fulfills the intent of Congress, because RCRA containssuch a ``regulatory gap'': it does not itself contain any analogous authorityto TSCA that would permit the Administrator to require testing of chemicals.Nowhere in TSCA is the gathering of data for regulatory purposes underother statutory programs such as RCRA prohibited or discouraged. Instead,the testing policy of Congress as explicitly mandated by TSCA is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">It is the policy of the U.S. that (1) adequate data should be developedwith respect to the effect of chemical substances and mixtures on healthand the environment, and (2) that the development of such data should bethe responsibility of those who manufacture and those who process suchchemical substances and mixtures. (TSCA section 2(b)).</ITAG>Therefore, EPA believes that: (1) A clear and justifiable need exists forthe development of adequate health and environmental data for the chemicalssubject to this rule; and (2) TSCA section 4 is an appropriate vehiclethrough which to obtain such data. 2. <T3>The ``may present an unreasonable risk'' (section 4(a)(1)(A)(i)) finding.</T3>Many comments were received concerning the basis for the section 4(a)(1)(A)findings of ``may present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or theenvironment'' for the chemicals listed in the proposed rule (Refs. 2, 16through 20, 27, 33, 38 through 44, and 49). Since CMA submitted the mostextensive comments on this topic, and many commenters incorporated CMA'scomments by reference, those comments will be the primary focus of EPA'sresponse. a. <T3>Regulation of chemicals as a category. </T3>CMA has stated that ``** * EPA correctly has not proposed that these test rules will apply toa category of chemicals, as that term is defined in TSCA section 26(c)(2),because no such category exists with respect to the 73 chemicals involved,''and that ``EPA must make each of the section 4(a)(1)(A) findings for eachof the 73 chemicals * * *'' Monsanto Company also does ``not believe thatthe Agency has the authority to regulate these 73 chemicals as a category,as is being attempted here.'' TSCA section 26(c)(2) defines ``category of chemical substances'' to meana group of chemical substances which are similar in structure, etc., or``which are in some other way suitable for classification as such for purposesof this Act, except that such term does not mean a group of chemical substanceswhich are grouped together solely on the basis of their being new chemicalsubstances.'' Therefore, the grouping of chemicals which share a commonclassification basis, such as hazardous waste constituents, is clearlypermitted under TSCA. Thus, while EPA believes that a category approachcould legally have been used for the proposed rule, instead EPA chose anindividual chemical approach and gathered and made available for commentinformation to support a section 4(a)(1)(A) finding of ``may present anunreasonable risk'' for each of the chemicals included in this final rule.b. <T3>Role of exposure data in section 4(a)(1)(A)(i) findings. </T3>Withregard to the rulemaking record, CMA commented that EPA concluded thatthe 73 chemicals meet the requirements for testing under section 4(a)(1)(A)(i)solely ``by virtue of these chemicals being identified as `hazardous constituents'[under the RCRA program].'' The Agency disagrees with this comment. While all chemicals subject tothis final rule are listed on Appendix VIII, this was not the sole criterionused by EPA to meet the requirements for testing under TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A)(i).Other factors listed in the proposed rule include: The nature of potentialtoxicity, the presence of these chemicals in treatment, storage, or disposalfacilities, evidence that existing land fills leak, and the potential forhuman exposure to these chemicals during treatment, storage, and disposalactivities and through possible leaching or volatilization. Also, toxicitydata for each of the chemicals are contained in the background documentfor section 3001, Subtitle C of RCRA, and/or a Health and EnvironmentalEffects Profile (HEEP), contained in the RCRA docket and incorporated byreference into the record for this rulemaking. The one exception is methanethiol;toxicity data for this chemical were inserted into the docket prior toreopening the comment period in December, 1987. Therefore, the section4(a)(1)(A)(i) finding was not made for these chemical substances solelyby virtue of their being identified as hazardous constituents under theRCRA program.Vulcan Chemicals submitted the comment, ``Although it is true that thesubject chemicals appear in Appendix VIII, they were not included in AppendixVIII because they presented an unreasonable risk to health or the environmentbut rather because they presented some degree of toxicity . . . AppendixVIII was established by EPA during the promulgation of the RCRA regulationsand the hazardous constituents contained therein are not necessarily ofsignificant toxicity.'' In response, EPA refers to 40 CFR 261.11(a), whichstates:<ITAG tagnum="21">Substances will be listed on App. VIII only if they have been shownin scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogeniceffects on humans or other life forms. </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">EPA acknowledges that the ``unreasonable risk'' standard was not usedin listing substances on Appendix VIII, but the Agency believes that thetoxicity and exposure data made available for public comment do supporta finding that the chemicals subject to this final rule ``may present anunreasonable risk.'' In support of EPA's section 4(a)(1)(A)(i) findingfor the subject chemicals in the proposed rule, the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil (NRDC; Ref. 20) believes that the threshold requirement for beinglisted in Appendix VIII is more than adequate to satisfy the ``may presentan unreasonable risk to health or the environment'' finding required byTSCA, noting that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Substances will be listed on Appendix VIII only if they have beenshown in scientific studies to have toxic, carcinogenic, mutagenic or teratogeniceffects on humans or other life forms. (40 CFR 261.11(a)).</ITAG>NRDC also believes that since EPA is basing its decision for a test ruleusing the ``unreasonable risk'' finding rather than the ``substantial exposure''(section 4(a)(1)(B)) finding, there is no requirement for a showing ofsubstantial human exposure. Their comments included a discussion of Congressionalintent in designing the TSCA testing program, noting that the ``unreasonablerisk'' standard for testing was to be used to identify ``those chemicalsubstances and mixtures about which there is a basis for concern, but aboutwhich there is inadequate information to reasonably predict or determinetheir effect on health or the environment.'' H.R. Rep. No. 94-1679, 94thCong., 2nd Sess. 61 (1976) (Conference Report). NRDC also cited Rep. Murphy,Chairman of the House Subcommittee that drafted TSCA, when explaining whentesting would be required using the ``may present an unreasonable risk''prong: ``If there is reliable preliminary data indicating that a substancemay be dangerous, again it would be reasonable to conclude that the chemicalmay present an unreasonable risk and that additional testing be done.''122 Cong. Rec. H11347 (daily ed., Sept. 28, 1976).NRDC pointed out in their comments that TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) ``is completelysilent on the issue of exposure'', and noted that ``The conscious choiceby Congress to omit any such reference to exposure under the `unreasonablerisk' prong has been consistently interpreted by EPA to require only thepotential for exposure.'' NRDC also cited a previous EPA position concerningexposure and the TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) findings: ``Monitoring or otherspecific exposure information will be unavailable in many cases, and therefore,the Agency will be compelled to rely upon reasonable conclusions aboutexposure potential'' (50 FR 859; January 7, 1985). NRDC therefore believesthe EPA's conclusion in the proposed rule regarding the potential for humanexposure to the subject chemicals during treatment, storage, and disposalactivities and through possible leaching or volatilization is sufficientto satisfy the first requirement of section 4(a)(1)(A) of TSCA.CMA, however, in its first set of comments (Ref. 2) stated its belief thatthe general assertions made by EPA in the proposed rule with regard tothe subject chemicals' potential for exposure to humans, i.e., the subjectchemicals are constituents of wastes to which humans might be exposed,``falls far short of the legal standards mandated by TSCA section 4(a).''Other industry commenters agreed.EPA agrees with NRDC that TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) does not require a showingor proof of substantial human exposure, and acknowledges that EPA has consistentlyinterpreted this finding to require only potential for exposure. However,since relevent data were easily available and obtained within the timeallowed for this rulemaking, the Agency made the decision to further supportthe findings by documenting the potential for exposure to the subject chemicals.EPA inserted into the docket for this rule, and opened for comment, datathat document the presence of the subject chemicals in waste streams and/orground water, demonstrating potential for significant human exposure. Thedata have been obtained by searching three data bases used by the Officeof Solid Waste: The Industry Studies Data Base (ISDB), the Damage IncidentData Base (DIDB), and the Hazardous Waste Disposal Site (HWDS) Data Base.Many of the chemicals are listed in more than one data base. Much of thedata contained in the ISDB is confidential business information (CBI),and is contained in a separate CBI docket. All non-CBI information wasmade available for review in the OPTS docket (No. 42088C). A brief descriptionof each data base is contained in the notice to reopen the comment periodon the proposed rule, 53 FR 911, January 14, 1988.The data show that tens of thousands of pounds of the subject chemicalsare being released annually via disposal. Also, the type of disposal describedin the data bases for the subject chemicals, such as deep-well injection,discharge to landfill, or discharge to a POTW (publicly-owned treatmentworks), indicate potential for leaching and exposure to these chemicals.Indeed, data exist for many of the chemicals which document incidents inwhich the chemicals have migrated from their place of treatment, storage,or ultimate diposal. It is likely that these data represent only a portionof actual contamination occurrences throughout the country.SOCMA (Ref. 40) believes that there is no evidence that each of the chemicalssubject to the rule is being released into the environment ``in quantitiessufficient to pose an unreasonable risk, nor has EPA supplied such proofwith the latest additions to the docket containing `exposure data' fromthree sources * * *'' CMA, in response to the exposure data inserted intothe rulemaking record, still maintains that EPA must demonstrate that thereare identified, relevant exposures of each chemical to humans, and thatsuch exposures result from the pertinent activities involved_in this case,from the disposal either of such substances or of products containing them.''Also, CMA maintains that the ``risk must be reasonably well characterized,with respect to both its nature (e.g., effects and populations involved)and its likelihood.''The Agency disagrees, because EPA believes that TSCA does not require thatEPA ``show'' or ``prove'' the existence of unreasonable (or substantial)risk, but rather that EPA find that a given chemical ``may present an unreasonablerisk.'' Accordingly, the exposure data inserted into the rulemaking recordwere intended to demonstrate potential for exposure, rather than proveboth the nature of the risk (effects and populations involved), and itslikelihood, as suggested by CMA.A recent court decision (Ausimont U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA; Ref. 45) supportsEPA's position on the role of exposure data and risk determination in section4(a)(1)(A) findings. The decision notes that ``the agency must be reasonablydiscriminate in selecting subjects for testing. But section 4 focuses oninvestigating areas of uncertainty as a prelude to regulating harmful substances.''It continues,<ITAG tagnum="21">Although mere scientific curiosity does not form an adequate basisfor a rule, as the seriousness of risk becomes known and the extent ofexposure increases, the need for testing fades into the necessity for regulatorysafeguards. The issue presented here is where in the spectrum this rulefalls. In most administrative proceedings, we examine the record to seeif there is a foundation for an agency determination of fact; however,here we look to see if the Administrator produced substantial evidenceto demonstrate not fact, but doubt and uncertainty.</ITAG>With regard to risk, the decision notes that the congressional conferencecommittee report on TSCA stated that the purpose of the testing provisionis to<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * focus the Administrator's attention on those chemical substancesand mixtures about which there is a basis for concern, but about whichthere is inadequate information to reasonably predict or determine theireffects on health or the environment. The Administrator need not show thatthe substance or mixture does or will present a risk * * * Although cautioningthat the agency must act reasonably and prudently, and take into considerationthe economic impact of any action, of necessity Congress granted EPA fairlybroad discretion in exercising its expertise to determine when data mustbe produced.</ITAG>CMA, in their last comment set (Ref. 43) expressed concern that ``it appearsto be virtually impossible for public commenters to search out chemical-specificinformation from the three data bases cited by EPA in support of theserules * * *'', and that ``it is simply not possible for members of thepublic to review any of the data upon which the Agency currently relies.''The Agency acknowledges that the public does not have full access to thethree EPA (and EPA contractor) data bases from which the exposure datawere obtained. This is because these data bases contain confidential businessinformation, as claimed by the companies that supplied the data to EPA.CMA itself notes that ``at least with respect to one of these data bases,most of its data are proprietary and thus are not legally available tothe public.'' Confidential data, although not available for public review,is not precluded from consideration when making a section 4 finding fortesting requirements. Section 14 of TSCA, governing disclosure of data,provides that any confidential data obtained by the Administrator mustnot be disclosed to the public except under certain circumstances, e.g.,in order to protect health or the environment against an unreasonable riskof injury to health or the environment.SOCMA and CMA expressed concern about the lack of detail presented in theinformation obtained from the data bases. Again, much of the informationis confidential, such as the type of disposal indicating potential forleaching and exposure to the subject chemicals (deep well injection, dischargeto landfill, or discharge to a publicly-owned treatment works), locationof sampling, etc. All non-confidential information available from the threeEPA data bases was inserted into the rulemaking record for public review.3. <T3>The ``data are insufficient'' (section 4(a)(1)(A)(iii)) finding. </T3>CMAasserted in its original set of comments (Ref. 2) that EPA had not demonstratedthat there are insufficient data and experience upon which the health orenvironmental effects of each chemical can reasonably be determined orpredicted, as required by TSCA. EPA disagrees with CMA's comments on thisissue for all chemicals subject to this final rule with the exception ofthree chemicals, for which supporting documentation for one endpoint eachwas missing from the Literature Search and Critique document containedin the public docket for the proposed rule. That information was insertedinto the public record and opened for public comment, 53 FR 911.With regard to the subchronic toxicity endpoint, the July 24, 1987 memorandumfrom the Office of Research and Development (ORD) to OSW contained in theLiterature Search Results and Critique document (OPTS docket 42088A) describesthe search strategy used by EPA's ORD. The strategy involved the reviewof published literature, computerized data bases, and also applicable non-CBIinformation in the EPA's Office of Toxic Substances and the Office of PesticidePrograms files. No subchronic toxicity data were found for any of the subjectchemicals, with the exception of phosgene. A February 9, 1987 memorandumfrom EPA's Environmental Criteria and Assessment Office to OSW (containedin the Literature Search document) explains why the existing data for phosgeneare insufficient to support OSW's concentration-based listing program.Due to other factors, however, EPA is not requiring testing for phosgene(see Unit II.B.15. of this preamble).CMA incorrectly assumed in its supplemental comments (Ref. 3) that EPArelied on the absence of a Health and Environmental Effect Profile (HEEP)to support the ``data are insufficient'' finding for this rule. Those HEEPdocuments included in the docket by reference instead were intended tosupport the section 4(a)(1)(A)(i) ``may present an unreasonable risk''finding.To identify and evaluate existing chemical fate information relevant tothe concentration-based listing program, a literature search was conductedand the report was made available for public comment in the docket. Thereport objective was to evaluate existing test data on soil sorption coefficients,anaerobic biodegradation (subsurface) rates, and hydrolysis rates for theirapplicability to the OSW ground water model. EPA was looking for studiesthat: (1) Provided quantitative data concerning the designated key parameters;and (2) were collected under physical conditions that approximate the groundwater environment. The TSCA test guidelines published on September 27,1985 (50 FR 39252) for hydrolysis as a function of pH 25 anddegrees;C (40CFR 796.3500) and sediment and soil adsorption isotherm (40 CFR 796.2750)provide general guidelines for evaluation of the test methods for hydrolysisrate and sorption coefficient, and data developed in general accordancewith these guidelines fulfill both criteria (1) and (2). The availableEPA test guidelines for biodegradation of chemical compounds do not simulatethe ground water environment, and do not yield data representative of thevarious subsurface environmental conditions prevalent in the United States.All chemicals were searched for each endpoint for which data were not already``in hand.'' Excluding one study on sorption coefficients, the resultsreported either did not provide quantitative test data for the designatedparameters or were conducted under conditions not related to ground waterenvironment. In addition, a large number of chemicals were found to haveno published information pertinent to the parameters of interest.SOCMA stated in its comments (Ref. 27) that ``much data are indeed available''on many of the proposed chemicals, but that ``because these data do notfit in EPA's quantitative modeling procedure developed to accomplish theconcentration-based listing program under RCRA, EPA has determined theexisting data to be unacceptable.'' SOCMA believes that the existing dataon several of these chemicals should be considered and that EPA shouldredesign the model to accommodate these available data. SOCMA did not submitany additional (existing) data with its comments.As pointed out in the preceding paragraph, EPA has reviewed all existingdata found through a thorough search of the literature, and concluded thatthe existing data either do not provide quantitative test data for thekey parameters consistent with the nation-wide implementation of the model,or were obtained under conditions not relevant to ground water media_themedium of potential exposure. Therefore, EPA finds that for these identifieddata gaps, there are insufficient data and experience upon which the healthor environmental effects of the subject OSW chemicals can reasonably bedetermined or predicted on a nation-wide basis. 4. <T3>Use of TSCA sections 8(a) and 8(d). </T3>CMA stated in its originalcomments (Ref. 2) that the ``pursuing a `fast track' to the rulemakings.''EPA ``both has failed to meet its statutory obligations under section 4(a),and has contravened the Agency's own policies for issuing section 4 testrules.'' CMA refers specifically to the fact that EPA did not ``call inexisting data under TSCA section 8(a) and 8(d), a process cited as ``establishedEPA policy'' in CMA's comments. EPA believes that these sections of TSCA have served as useful tools inthe gathering of production, release, health effects, and safety informationfor many previous test rule candidates, particularly those recommendedfor testing to EPA by the Interagency Testing Committee (ITC). Sections8 (a) and (d) are automatically ``triggered'' at the time a chemical isformally recommended by the ITC for testing consideration and thus dataare obtained expeditiously for ITC chemicals. However, the use of the rulemakingauthorities under TSCA section 8 for information gathering purposes isnot required prior to conducting rulemaking pursuant to TSCA section 4.No such expeditious automatic mechanism exists for non-ITC chemicals, andconventional rulemaking would not have produced section 8 (a) and (d) dataon a timely basis. Furthermore, any available studies could have been submittedto EPA in response to the proposed section 4 rule. Finally, EPA's Officeof Research and Development conducted a search of existing TSCA section8(d) files as part of their literature search for subchronic toxicity data.5. <T3>The ``testing is necessary'' (section 4(a)(1)(A)(iii)) finding. </T3>CMAnoted in their original comments (Ref. 2) that ``under section 4(a), EPAmay require testing only if the data to be developed'' are relevant toa determination that the manufacture, distribution in commerce, processing,use, or disposal [of the chemical], or that any combination of such activities,does or does not present an unreasonable risk of injury to health or theenvironment.'' CMA believes that EPA did not establish this relationshipbetween the proposed testing and future Agency regulatory determinationsconcerning unreasonable risks, and that RCRA relisting decisions involveno such determinations. EPA believes that testing is necessary for each of the chemicals subjectto this final rule, as follows from section 4(a)(1)(A) (i) and (ii) findings,to develop data which are relevant to determining whether the disposalof the subject chemicals by various means or various concentrations presentan unreasonable risk. The Agency has established that each of these chemicalsmay present an unreasonable risk, and that for the health effects and chemicalfate endpoints of concern, data are either not available or are inadequatefor use in the OSW concentration-based listing program. Unit II.A.3. ofthis preamble contains a discussion of why available data are inadequateand why the particular testing endpoints were determined to be criticalto the determination of unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environmentthrough disposal to landfills of certain concentrations of the subjectchemicals in waste streams. 6. <T3>Who is subject to testing requirements</T3>_a. <T3>Byproduct and `'inadvertent'' manufacture. </T3>EPA originally proposedthat manufacturers of the subject chemicals as byproducts or impuritiesbe subject to the rule. Procter andamp; Gamble (Refs. 23 and 50), VulcanChemicals (Ref. 33), and SOCMA (Ref. 27) believe that the proposed testrule should be revised to exempt companies who manufacture or process thesubject chemicals only as byproducts without a separate commercial intent.SOCMA suggested that ``in certain limited circumstances it may be appropriatefor EPA to propose not to grant a standard section 4 testing exemptionto impurity and waste byproduct manufacturers,'' such as when ``no onemanufactures or imports the subject chemical and current data show thatthe subject chemical is being discharged to the environment,'' or ``whenthe volume of impurities or waste byproducts manufactured is a substantialpercentage of the amount of the substance intentionally produced.'' Procter andamp; Gamble wrote, ``The historical roots of section 4 in theEckhart Subcommittee work on TSCA were the sharing of the costs of testgeneration in direct proportion to the economic benefits which producersderived from the chemicals.''EPA does not agree that the intention of Congress to have producers sharethe cost of testing should be interpreted to exclude producers of byproductsfrom TSCA section 4 testing requirements. While economic benefit is notderived directly from the production of the subject chemical, the productionand disposal of the byproduct are a result of a production process by whichthe company does derive economic benefit (an indirect benefit). In addition,the potential for significant exposure to a chemical exists through itsdisposal as a byproduct, such as for the chemicals acetophenone and bis(2-chloroisopropyl)ethersubject to this rule, for which environmental release has been documented.CMA originally recommended (Ref. 2) that EPA adopt a ``tiering'' approachto the coverage of byproducts and impurities, so that such chemicals wouldbe subject only if the Agency first determines, as part of its test ruleimplementation, that no persons manufacture (or import) the subject chemicalsas primary commercial products.In their supplemental comments (Ref. 3), however, CMA wrote, ``Althoughwe continue to believe that such an approach is viable for these rules,our further consideration of the rules' impacts and analytical requirementsleads us to conclude that the Agency should adopt the approach spelledout in these supplemental comments, of limiting testing requirements bythe `known to or reasonably ascertainable by' standard described herein.''CMA acknowledged that ``because EPA intends to use the data from theserules as part of the Agency's RCRA relisting activities, and because ofthe possible involvement of impurities and byproducts in waste-relatedactivities, EPA might be justified in applying the rules to impuritiesand byproducts in the manner described in these comments.'' CMA's major concern with the applicability of the test rule to impuritiesand byproducts is the ``tremendous analytical burdens'' which these requirementswould impose. CMA believes that the rule would, in effect, require companiesto analyze all of their products for each of the chemicals listed in thisfinal rule. EPA concurs with CMA on this issue, and did not intend under the proposedrule that companies be required to perform analytical work in order todetermine whether their manufacturing (and import) operations trigger thefinal testing requirements. EPA believes a company should be subject tothis final rule (with respect to manufacture of the subject chemical solelyas byproducts) only if it is known to or reasonably ascertainable by thatcompany that such manufacture takes place. b. <T3>Impurity manufacture. </T3>EPA proposed that manufacturers of the subjectchemicals as impurities be subject to the testing requirements of thisrule. While EPA believes that this is logical and appropriate, for thesame reasons as stated above for byproduct manufacturers, none of the subjectchemicals are produced solely as an impurity, and those produced as impuritiesare produced by the same companies as byproducts. Therefore, so as notto unduly burden industry and the Agency with applications for exemptionfrom testing, this requirement has been deleted from 40 CFR 799.5055(b).c. <T3>Nonisolated intermediate manufacture. </T3>Several industry commentersobjected to required testing of chemicals produced ``solely as nonisolatedintermediates.'' The particular chemicals and companies are identifiedin Unit II.B. of this preamble, which responds to chemical-specific comments.While EPA acknowledges that the amount of chemical substance released asa result of this type of production may be less than other types, suchas byproducts, manufacturing or processing a chemical as an intermediatedoes not preclude exposure to that chemical. It is common experience thatprocess waste streams and reactor vessel residues will contain ``intermediates.''In many instances, these chemicals are released to the environment as fugitiveemissions, liquid or solid wastes, and as unreacted feedstock (impurities)in finished products. Furthermore, many intermediates are stored on-sitein large quantities until batch reacted on demand for a given product (thesame intermediate may be used as feedstock for different products or maybe stockpiled until needed). As such, ``intermediates'' typically existas chemicals to which there is potential for human exposure. Also, EPAhas found data documenting the presence in ground or surface water of thesubject chemicals cited by commenters as being produced as nonisolatedintermediates, 53 FR 911. d. <T3>Pesticides. </T3>Two chemicals subject to this final rule, endrin andmaleic hydrazide, are not listed in the TSCA Inventory, because their primaryuse has been (endrin) and is (maleic hydrazide) as pesticides. However,this does not preclude their being subject to this section 4 rule. TSCAsection 3(2)(B((ii) exempts from coverage ``any pesticide * * * when manufactured,processed, or distributed in commerce for use as a pesticide.'' This testrule is based on section 4(a)(1)(A) findings for the subject chemicals,due to potential for unreasonable risk associated with their disposal.The disposal of endrin and maleic hydrazide does not constitute ``use asa pesticide,'' and so is subject to regulation under TSCA. Manufacturersand processors of endrin and maleic hydrazide are thus subject to the testingrequirements because the chemicals are disposed of, as discussed above.e. <T3>Research and development, and/or low volume manufacture. </T3>In theproposed rule, EPA discussed several approaches to dealing with chemicalssubject to the rule which may be produced only for research and development(Randamp;D) or in small quantities. The Agency has received several commentson this issue, most concurring with an Randamp;D waiver, and an aggregateproduction threshold for low volume chemicals. It is now apparent, however,that none of the chemicals subject to the final rule fall into either ofthese categories. Therefore, EPA has not included any Randamp;D waiver provisionin the rule.7. <T3>Export notification. </T3>Section 12(b) of TSCA requires exportersof chemicals for which final test rules have been issued under section4 to ``notify the Administrator of such exportation or intent to export* * *.'' SOCMA (Ref. 27) commented that if the Agency fails to grant exemptionsfrom testing to those who manufacture the subject chemicals only as byproducts,EPA will be ``inundated by useless section 12(b) notifications,'' and wouldpresent an unacceptable burden to the regulated community and to EPA. CMA(Ref. 2) also believes that the section 12(b) requirements should not applyto the chemicals subject to this final rule, and noted that the intentionof this rule is ``to provide for the environmentally secure disposal ofhazardous wastes.'' CMA suggests that this is not an export issue, andit ``should not trigger the unnecessary and burdensome impacts of reportingunder section 12(b).''While EPA acknowledges that this requirement may be burdensome to industryand the Agency for this rule, it is required under TSCA that section 12(b)apply to all chemicals subject to testing under section 4. EPA is continuingto examine the implementation of section 12(b) and ways to reduce burdenin relation to TSCA section 4 rules and the Paperwork Reduction Act.8. <T3>Testing schedule. </T3>CMA suggested (Ref. 2) that ``if EPA is unableto complete the modeling necessary for RCRA relisting until all intendeddata have been generated, then a consistent testing schedule should beestablished for all of these parameters. If the proposed anaerobic biodegradationprotocol is adopted, a 20-month schedule would be appropriate because thatprotocol requires up to 64 weeks.''EPA disagrees with this comment. The testing schedule as proposed and nowfinalized is consistent with the time allotted for the various tests inprevious section 4 rules. Also, ``staggering'' the submission of test resultsrather than requiring the same schedule for all test parameters will allowthe Agency time to review the data. 9. <T3>Confidential business information </T3>(CBI). While CMA acknowledged(Ref. 2) that EPA intends to protect CBI submitted under these rules inthe same manner that the Agency protects data submitted under other section4 rules, CMA expressed concern that the final rule would impose testingrequirements upon certain chemicals that were reported for the TSCA section8(b) Inventory, but whose identities were claimed confidential. This commentis no longer applicable, since no such chemicals are subject to this finalrule. All CBI (economic and exposure) associated with this final rule hasbeen protected from disclosure.10. <T3>Proposed toxicity testing requirement. </T3>Three commenters, NRDC(Ref. 20), SOCMA (Ref. 27), and the U.S. Department of Interior (USDOI)(Ref. 28), addressed issues concerning the proposed toxicity testing. NRDCand USDOI concurred that the health effects testing is warranted; however,NRDC believes that the proposed 90-day subchronic toxicity study is grosslyinadequate to determine the adverse health effects of the chemicals inquestion.NRDC recommended that a series of additional tests be performed to fullyascertain carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic effects of these chemicals.First, NRDC advised EPA to replace the 90-day subchronic test in favorof a two-year chronic toxicity test. NRDC maintained that the 90-day testis not adequate to determine long-term effects from prolonged exposure.Second, NRDC urged the adoption of a tiered testing plan that would incorporate:a. Initial analysis of each chemical to determine whether there exist structuralanalogues which are carcinogens, mutagens, neurotoxins, or are associatedwith reproductive effects, and whether the chemical is an alkylating agent.b. A battery of mutagenicity tests for all chemicals.c. Satellite tests for carcinogenicity, adverse reproductive effects, andneurotoxicity. NRDC maintained that the plan contained in its comment wouldfully characterize a chemical's chronic toxicity.On the other hand, SOCMA recommended that the Agency reevaluate the requirementto perform the 90-day subchronic test in view of chemicals on the listthat are not amenable to testing by this method and the impact of testingon the regulated community.EPA acknowledges NRDC's comment regarding the scope of tests required tofully characterize a given chemical's toxic potential. However, the purposeof this test rule is to obtain data in support of OSW's concentration-based(relisting) program. OSW has determined that relistings can be accomplishedusing toxicity data from a 90-day study. The Agency maintains that a well-designedand conducted subchronic animal study is minimally sufficient for developinga human reference dose (RfD) for chronic (systemic) toxicity.With regard to SOCMA's comments, chemicals which are not suited to thismethod are no longer designated for testing, as discussed in Unit II.B.of this preamble. The impact on the testing community is discussed in thefinal Economic Analysis for this rule and in Units II.D. and IV. of thispreamble.USDOI wrote that the subchronic toxicity study as proposed is appropriateonly for mammalian systems; this test would fail to provide toxicity informationfor aquatic organisms. USDOI asked that the proposed rule be amended toinclude testing of invertebrates and fish species and suggested that EPAadopt: (1) A <T3>Daphnia magna </T3>life cycle (21-day renewal) chronic toxicity test;and (2) a fish life cycle toxicity test.EPA agrees with USDOI's comment that acquiring and using toxicity datafor aquatic organisms is necessary. In fact, the Agency is developing amethod for assessing the ecological impacts of hazardous waste constituents.However, the Agency believes that it is premature to require the aquatictoxicity tests recommended by USDOI at this time since EPA does not havea well-defined, quantitative process for using aquatic toxicity informationin establishing concentration-based listings.11. <T3>Biodegradation testing should be made optional. </T3>Several commentersaddressed EPA's solicitation of comments on whether the proposed anaerobicbiodegradation testing should be optional rather than required. Some ofthese commenters said that manufacturers should be given the opportunityto forego biodegradation testing, thereby tacitly accepting establishmentof lower relisting concentrations by assuming ``zero biodegradation.''Only one commenter (NRDC; Ref. 20) stated that biodegradation testing shouldnot be made optional.EPA has decided not to require the biodegradation test, because it is anexpensive test and EPA can fully protect the environment by assuming zerobiodegradation (a worst case condition) in the absence of data. In thefuture, if data becomes available that can be used to more accurately predicta chemical's biodegradation rate, then a non-zero value may be used. Thus,individual manufacturers will be able to decide whether the benefits ofdeveloping a more realistic estimate, i.e., for each chemical, performingthe test and having the data used in the chemical fate and transport model,is worth the cost of conducting the test, or whether it is more cost-effectiveto not perform the test and have EPA utilize a model which assumes no biodegradationof that chemical. Persons who must make the decision whether or not totest are reminded that, although the protocol contains only a single assay,it can in many respects be considered at tiered test. Because of the waytime points were selected, compounds that degrade rapidly will requirea minimum amount of effort, whereas compounds that do not degrade overthe 64-week period will require samples at all time periods to be analyzed.This approach has been clarified in the revised (final) protocol. The Agencybelieves that any alternative (non-tiered) approach would be less cost-effectiveand more time consuming than the tiered approach described in the protocol.12. <T3>Chemical fate testing should be ``tiered.'' </T3>Several commenterssaid that EPA should not require the entire battery of chemical fate testingdescribed in the proposed rule. According to one commenter, it would bemore cost-effective to replace the requirements to test for biodegradation,hydrolysis, and soil absorption with a tiered approach to testing. Suchan approach would allow affected manufacturers to utilize screening teststo determine whether a more definitive test is indicated.The objective of the biodegradation protocol is to provide anaerobic degradationrate constants for chemicals listed in the test rule. These rates are tobe used in EPA's quantitative modeling procedures to evaluate potentialexposure due to groundwater contamination. The key to this protocol isthe development of rate constants appropriate for the evaluation of groundwatercontamination. Although not of the usual tiered design, the protocol doesuse a tiered approach. The test has been designed so that, when the testchemical concentration has been reduced by 95 percent the test is terminated.Therefore the test is tiered on the specific time intervals after whichsamples would have to be taken. In the protocol, samples are to be analyzedat 0, 4, 8, 16, 32 and 64 weeks. If the chemical is completely degradedby week 4, the remaining four samples do not have to be completed. Thiswould reduce the analytical portion of the protocol by 66.6 percent andthe microbiological analyses by 33.3 percent. This would effectively reducethe cost of the protocol by more than 25 percent for rapidly degraded chemicals.In light of these considerations, EPA believes that in many cases for chemicalssubject to this final rule, it would be advantageous for manufacturersand processors to perform this test for their chemicals. A screening testwas considered; however, due to the duration of the adaptation period,the amount of time necessary to complete a screening test could be extensive.Performance of the screening test could result in a significant delay inproviding results of the full test, if it were determined that one wasneeded. Also, the cost savings of such a screening test would not be significant.Therefore, incentive for conducting such a test is reduced.B. Chemical-Specific Comments1. <T3>Bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane. </T3>Morton Thiokol, Inc. (MTI) (Ref.19) commented that the studies specified for bis(2-chloroethoxy) methanein the proposed rule, i.e., subchronic toxicity, hydrolysis, and biodegradationtests, are unwarranted. MTI believes that it is the only manufacturer andprocessor of this compound. MTI stated that bis(2-chloroethoxy) methaneis a site-limited intermediate confined in a completely enclosed system,and it is consumed entirely in the production of polysulfide rubber polymers.According to MTI, all wastes associated with the production of polysulfiderubber are deep-well injected, and thus MTI asserted that there is virtuallyno human exposure to bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane.EPA does not believe that the practice of deep-well injection necessarilyprecludes human exposure. Also, MTI did acknowledge in its comment thatpast disposal practices (other than deep-well injection) at the company'sMoss Point, Mississippi, plant have contaminated the groundwater with bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane at levels as high as 5 mg/L. In addition, wastes from other sourceswhich contain bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane as an impurity may currentlybe land disposed, and thus could pose a risk to human health and the environment.Finally, as MTI pointed out, bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane has been measuredin groundwater at a superfund site in Plumsted Township, New Jersey, thusproviding additional evidence that the land disposal of bis(2-chloroethoxy)methane-containing waste can lead to its entry into the human-accessibleenvironment. Therefore, the Agency has retained the specific test requirementsfor bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane.2. <T3>Benzal chloride. </T3>Monsanto Co. (Ref. 18) objected to requiringtesting on benzal chloride because it is a chemical that rapidly hydrolyzes,and thus the biodegradation testing would not provide meaningful results.The Agency agrees that the compound hydrolyzes very quickly and thus biodegradationtesting is unnecessary. This chemical has not been included among the chemicalsrecommended for biodegradation testing.3. <T3>4-Chlorobenzotrichloride. </T3>Occidental Chemical (Ref. 21) submittedinformation to EPA on 4-chlorobenzotrichloride to support its objectionsto the proposed health effects testing. Occidental's hydrolysis data indicatethat the chemical has an aqueous half-life of 2 minutes at 25 anddegrees;C.According to Occidental, oral exposure is not a relevant route of exposurefor this chemical since it is unlikely that waste leachate, surface, orgroundwater would contain 4-chlorobenzotrichloride, because of its shorthalf-life. Occidental also believes that 4-chlorobenzotrichloride is notamenable to the oral gavage toxicity study because hydrolysis would occurin the gastrointestinal tract and thus reduce the effective exposure to4-chlorobenzotrichloride.EPA recognizes that the reported rapid hydrolysis of 4-chlorobenzotrichloridewould result in water not being a significant medium of exposure to thechemical. However, the Agency disagrees with Occidental's assertion thatoral exposure is not a relevant route for 4-chlorobenzotrichloride. Theingestion of 4-chlorobenzotrichloride-contaminated soil (particularly bychildren) is a potential route of oral exposure. The Agency requires oraltoxicity data to assess the associated health hazard.As for Occidental's concern regarding the technical feasibility of thegavage study, the finding that 4-chlorobenzotrichloride is rapidly hydrolyzedin water does not preclude the use of another medium, such as corn oil,as the gavage vehicle.Occidental also objected to chemical fate testing for this chemical becauseit will hydrolyze before soil addition/equilibration, and that biodegradationis not expected to be an important fate process. Aqueous hydrolysis testingfor this chemical conducted by this commenter has been submitted to EPA.The Agency agrees that, owing to this chemical's relatively rapid hydrolysis,it is an inappropriate candidate for biodegradation testing and has removedthis chemical from the list of chemicals subject to hydrolysis, biodegradation,and soil sorption testing.4. <T3>Dibutyl phthalate. </T3>(CMA (Ref. 5 and 38) objected to TSCA section4 biodegradation testing for this chemical, saying that there was no evidenceof direct exposure to this chemical as a result of waste disposal activities,and that there was no evidence to conclude that exposure to this chemicalat waste sites presents a serious risk of adverse health or environmentaleffects. The Phthalate Esters Program Panel of CMA ``does not dispute thatDBP may be found at detectable levels at some waste disposal sites. However,without evidence of concentration levels or of migration away from thesites at detectable levels, there can be no basis for finding that wastedisposal activities involving DBP may present an unreasonable risk of injury.''The Agency disagrees with these comments. As explained in Unit II.A.2.b.of this preamble, EPA believes that TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) does not requirea showing or proof of substantial human exposure, and has consistentlyinterpreted this finding to require only potential for exposure. EPA believesthat the data contained in the record for dibutyl phthalate documents potentialfor exposure to this chemical.CMA (Ref. 38) also commented that ``EPA had not identified any adversehealth or environmental effects that are reasonably likely to occur asa result of environmental exposure to DBP.''Although a specific health or environmental effect of concern has not beenidentified for this chemical, the listing of this chemical as a hazardousconstituent in Appendix VIII of RCRA, the toxicity data supporting thatlisting, and the toxicity data supporting this rule summarized in a Healthand Environmental Effects Profile (HEEP), all indicate a concern for thegeneral toxicity of this chemical. This concern creates uncertainties withregard to the degree of risk associated with the disposal of wastes thatcontain dibutyl phthalate as a constituent. EPA requests data on the biodegradationof this chemical to use in modeling, as explained in Units II.A.3. andII.C.2. of this preamble.CMA (Ref. 38) stated that ``the development of anaerobic biodegradationdata will not assist EPA in improving its ability to assess the risk thesechemicals present to human health or the environment,'' referring to thechemicals dibutyl phthalate and dimethyl phthalate (DMP). CMA continues,``Moreover, biodegradation data in fact are already available for bothDMP and DBP, and the Agency has not explained why additional data are neededor how such data might be used.''EPA disagrees with these comments. As is explained in Units II.A.3. andII.C.2. of this preamble, and was stated in the proposed test rule forthese chemicals, the objective of the anaerobic biodegradation protocolfinalized in this rule is to provide anaerobic biodegradation rate constantsfor chemicals. These rates will be used in EPA's subsurface fate and transportmodel to evaluate the potential risk to human health and the environmentfrom migration of these chemicals in subsurface conditions prevalent inthe United States. Units II.A.3. and II.C.2. explain why existing datadeveloped under alternative protocols are not adequate for EPA's determinationof whether the disposal of these chemicals by various means or variousconcentrations presents an unreasonable risk. Biodegradation testing forDBP is recommended, but not required. 5. <T3>Dichlorobenzenes. </T3>Monsanto Co. (Ref. 18) objected to TSCA section4 testing for these chemcials because EPA had not demonstrated the necessaryfindings to develop a test rule under TSCA section 4(a). The Agency disagrees. In addition to available toxicity data, the Agencyhas data on the occurrence of the chemicals in regulated and unregulatedwaste streams and in contaminated soil, groundwater, and surface waterand has provided that data for public comment, 53 FR 911. Thus, the Agencyfinds that disposal of the dichlorobenzenes may present an unreasonablerisk of injury to human health and/or the environment. Testing is requiredand recommended for 1,2-dichlorobenzene; for 1,3- and 1,4-dichlorobenzene,no testing is required, but the optional anaerobic biodegradation testis recommended. A detailed discussion of the findings is presented in UnitsII.A.2.3., and 5. of this preamble. 6. <T3>1,1-Dichloroethane. </T3>Vulcan Chemicals (Ref. 33) objected to testingfor this chemical, saying that it is produced as a nonisolated intermediate.The Agency disagrees. Simply stating that a chemical is produced as a ``nonisolatedintermediate'' does not preclude release of the chemical to the environmentas a component of a waste stream or as an impurity in a finished product(see Unit II.A.6.C. of this preamble). The Agency believes that 1,1-dichloroethane will have a hydrolysis half-lifeof greater than 10 years in the environment. The Agency needs data on thehydrolysis and anaerobic biodegradation of this chemical to use in modeling,as explained in Units II.A.3. and II.C.2. of this preamble. 7. <T3>2,3-Dichloropropanol. </T3>Eastman Kodak Co. (Ref. 9) objected to testingfor this chemical, saying that it is produced in very small quantities(average of 20 kg/yr since 1980) and that a significant adverse economicimpact would result if a test rule was imposed. The Agency disagrees. Although Eastman Kodak Co. produces only a smallamount of 2,3-dichloropropanol annually, this compound and 1,3-dichloro-2-propanol,collectively known as dichlorohydrins, are produced as intermediates duringthe conversion of allyl chloride to epichlorohydrin (Ref. 34). Dow Chemicalat Freeport, TX and Shell Chemical at Deer Park, TX are the sole producersof epichlorohydrin using this process. Domestic production of epichlorohydrinusing this process was estimated at 440 million pounds in 1984 (Ref. 35).Additional market information obtained subsequent to publication of theproposed rule and incorporated into the revised economic analysis (availablefor comment January 14, 1988) indicate that the potential for adverse economicimpact is low for 2,3-dichloropropanol. The Agency has data indicating the presence of this chemical in regulatedand unregulated waste streams, and requests data on the biodegradationof this chemical to use in modeling, as explained in Units II.A.3. andII.C.2. of this preamble. 8. <T3>Dimethyl phthalate. </T3>CMA (Ref. 5 and 38) objected to TSCA section4 biodegradation testing for this chemical, saying that there was no evidenceof direct exposure to this chemical as a result of waste disposal activities,and that there was no evidence to conclude that exposure to this chemicalat waste sites presents a serious risk of adverse health or environmentaleffects. The Agency disagrees with these comments. As discussed in Unit II.A.2.b.of this preamble, the data indicating the presence of this chemical inregulated and unregulated waste streams, in groundwater contaminated byreleases from RCRA and CERCLA sites, and contaminated soil, groundwater,or surface water resulting from hazardous waste mismanagement incidentsdocuments potential for exposure. Other comments made by CMA for this chemical (Ref. 38) are the same asthe comments submitted for dibutyl phthalate and are addressed in UnitII.B.4. of this preamble. The Agency requests data on the biodegradationof this chemical to use in modeling, as explained in Units II.A.3. andII.C.2. of this preamble. 9. <T3>Endrin. </T3>Velsicol Chemical Corp. (Ref. 32) said that the chemicalis no longer manufactured and did not have TSCA-regulated uses when previouslymanufactured. As a result of its uses which did not fall under TSCA, thiscommenter believed that it could not have been subject to a TSCA section4 rulemaking. This issue has been addressed in Unit II.A.6.d. of this preamble. Confidentialdata exist which support section 4 rulemaking for this chemical by showingthat these chemicals are disposed of, and that potential for exposure exists.10. <T3>Maleic anhydride. </T3>Maleic Anhydride Consortium (Ref. 16) and DowChemical Co. (Ref. 8) noted that there is substantial documentation indicatingthat this chemical hydrolyzes very rapidly. These commenters felt thatmaleic anhydride is therefore an inappropriate candidate for soil sorptionand biodegradation testing. The Agency agrees and has removed this chemical from the list of chemicalsto be tested for hydrolysis, biodegradation, and soil sorption testing.11. <T3>Malononitrile. </T3>Lonza, Inc. (Ref. 15) commented that malononitrile,a chemical intermediate imported by the commenter in small amounts (161,800lbs in 1986) and sold exclusively to the pharmaceutical industry for usein manufacturing several products, should not be tested because it is notland disposed. According to Lonza, malononitrile is consumed during theproduction of these pharmaceutical products, and, because of its toxicity,is treated to ensure that none remains in the products. The commenter alsosaid that Lonza (as importer) and the pharmaceutical purchasers (as processors)would reclaim any off-specification malononitrile because it is very expensive.Finally, Lonza stated that it would withdraw malononitrile from the marketshould the rule become final because it cannot justify the expense of therequired tests, especially in view of the company's position that malononitrileshould be banned from land disposal. The Agency maintains that malononitrile should undergo the specified tests.In its comment, Lonza said that its material safety data sheet for thischemical states that malononitrile, because of its toxicity, should bedisposed of by incineration. However, this recommendation does not necessarilyensure that the users or processors of the chemical are actually incineratingtheir off-specification material. In fact, malononitrile's presence inunregulated wastes, as documented by the Agency in its January, 1988 notice,published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 14, 1988 (53 FR 911), suggests thatit may currently be land disposed, and thus, could potentially enter theenvironment. Without data on the biodegradation and soil sorption potential of malononitrile,the Agency cannot assess its persistence. Furthermore, without additionaldata on the toxic potential of this chemical, EPA cannot adequately characterizeits effects on health. 12.<T3> Methyl chloride.</T3> The Methyl Chloride Industry Association (Ref.17 and 42) and Vulcan Chemicals (Ref. 49) objected to testing for thischemical, saying that EPA has not justified its section 4 ``may presentan unreasonable risk'' finding, and had not given full consideration toan earlier proposed test rule (1980) for this chemical that was withdrawn.The Agency disagrees with these comments. Although a previous (1980) section4 proposed rule was withdrawn for this chemical, the Agency now has dataindicating the presence of this chemical in regulated and unregulated wastestreams, in groundwater contaminated by release from RCRA and CERCLA sites,and in contamination resulting from hazardous waste mismanagement incidents.In addition, as explained in Unit II.A.2.b. of this preamble, EPA believesthat TSCA section 4(a)(1)(A) does not require a showing or proof of substantialhuman exposure, and has consistently interpreted this finding to requireonly potential for exposure. EPA believes that the data contained in therecord for methyl chloride documents potential for exposure to this chemical.Vulcan Chemicals (Ref. 33) noted that this chemical is produced as a nonisolatedintermediate and is normally a gas under ambient conditions. Although methylchloride has a very low boiling point, the Henry's Law constant for thechemical is .04 atm-m3/mole (Ref. 46). Henry's Law constant is a ratioof the chemical's vapor pressure to its solubility in water, and providesan indication of whether or not the chemical will be present in groundwater.Due to the value of Henry's Law constant for methyl chloride, and the factthat it has been found in waste streams, the Agency requests data on thischemical to use in modeling, as explained in Units II.A.3. and II.C.2.of this preamble. 13.<T3> p-Nitroaniline.</T3> Monsanto Co. (Ref. 18) opposed the testing ofthis chemical because it is a small volume chemical intermediate, and thereis very little economic justification to support the testing as it hasbeen proposed. The Agency disagrees. The Agency has data indicating the presence of thischemical in regulated and unregulated waste streams, in groundwater contaminatedrelease from RCRA and CERCLA sites, and in contamination resulting fromhazardous waste mismanagement incidents. Thus, despite the fact that <T3>p</T3>-nitroaniline may be a small volume intermediate, it appearsthat its manufacture and disposal result in the potential for human exposure.The Agency requests biodegradation data on this chemical to use in modeling,as explained in Units II.A.3. and II.C.2. of this preamble. 14.<T3> p-Nitrophenol.</T3> Monsanto Co. (Ref. 18) commented that EPA shouldexempt <T3>p</T3>-nitrophenol from the required subchronic toxicity test. Giventhe very small amount of <T3>p</T3>-nitrophenol manufactured for TSCA-regulated purposes, Monsantosaid it would cease the TSCA-related production of this chemical if therule is finalized as proposed. The commenter said that the majority ofits <T3>p</T3>-nitrophenol is manufactured as an intermediate in the productionof an FDA-regulated product. Monsanto urged the Agency to use existinghealth effects data to make decisions regarding relisting, and directedEPA to the health effects summary of its <T3>p</T3>-nitrophenol material safety data sheet. EPA reviewed the above-mentioned summary and concluded that the informationdiscussed is inadequate for quantitative use. Monsanto's information consistsof: (1) Very limited, qualitative statements regarding the adverse effectsof occupational exposure to the chemical; (2) the results of two acuterodent studies (inhalation and gavage); and (3) several negative mutagenicityor genotoxic activity tests. The Agency requires, at the very minimum,a well-designed and conducted subchronic study for use in deriving an RfD.Such a study does not currently exist for<T3> p</T3>-nitrophenol. Therefore, EPA is requiring that one be performed.With regard to the amount of<T3> p</T3>-nitrophenol manufactured for TSCA-regulated purposes, the Agencydisagrees with Monsanto's comment. EPA's finding is based on the section4(a)(1)(A) ``may present an unreasonable risk'' finding, and not the section4(a)(1)(B) ``substantial production and release'' finding; therefore, theTSCA production need not be substantial. Also, the Agency has data indicatingthe presence of this chemical in regulated and unregulated waste streams,in groundwater contamination from RCRA and CERCLA sites, and in contaminationresulting from hazardous waste management incidents. The Agency needs dataon this chemical in order to accurately model environmental conditionsthat are protective of human health and the environment. 15.<T3> Phosgene.</T3> CMA (Ref. 6), Dow (Ref. 8), Olin (Ref. 22), and Vulcan(Ref. 33), objected to including phosgene in the list of chemicals subjectto health effects and chemical fate testing. Olin and CMA commented thatphosgene is a gas which is manufactured and used in closed-system productionunits. Vulcan also stated that phosgene is a trace byproduct formed duringthe production of chlorinated hydrocarbons, and is normally contained withinthe process unit. The commenters pointed out that a solid phosgene wasteis not produced. CMA argued that the entire concept of a subchronic toxicitystudy for phosgene is inappropriate: Phosgene would react with water inthe lung tissue to form carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid if a toxicitystudy were conducted via inhalation. If phosgene were administered viaoral gavage using water as the vehicle, the chemicals studied would bemostly carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid, not phosgene. The Agency concurs that phosgene is an inappropriate candidate for an oralsubchronic toxicity study. At ambient temperature, phosgene is normallya gas, and thus it is not in a physical state suited for the oral gavagetest protocol. Even if conditions existed whereby phosgene could be introducedinto a gavage vehicle, the high reactivity of this chemical would makeit nearly impossible to maintain the integrity of the dosing solution.Therefore, EPA is eliminating phosgene from the toxicity testing requirements.The commenters noted that this chemical is highly reactive and that theproposed chemical fate testing is scientifically inappropriate. The Agency agrees that this chemical is an inappropriate candidate forthe proposed environmental fate testing based on its reactivity and hasremoved it from the list of compounds to be tested for hydrolysis, biodegradation,and soil sorption. 16.<T3> Phthalic anhydride.</T3> CMA (Ref. 4) objected to TSCA section 4 testingfor this chemical because it believed that EPA had not demonstrated thatthere is evidence of measurable exposure as a result of waste disposalactivities, and EPA had not linked health or environmental effects to thischemical from environmental exposure. The Agency disagrees. The Agency has data indicating the presence of thischemical in regulated and unregulated waste streams and in contaminatedsoil, groundwater, or surface water resulting from hazardous waste mismanagementincidents. The Agency needs data on this chemical to accurately model environmentalconditions so that regulations can be developed that are protective ofhuman health and the environment. 17.<T3> 2-Picoline.</T3> Lonza Inc. (Ref. 15) objected to testing of thischemical because it is potentially used up in the production of agriculturalchemicals and pharmaceuticals and would be unlikely to be discarded. The Agency disagrees. There is currently no regulation which places a prohibitionon disposal of this chemical on land, and the Agency has data indicatingthe presence of this chemical in regulated and unregulated waste streams.The Agency requests data on this chemical to accurately model environmentalconditions so that regulations can be developed that are protective ofhuman health and the environment. C. Biodegradation Protocol Comments on the EPA-developed anaerobic biodegradation testing protocolwere received from 15 sources including trade associations, chemical producers,universities, and State and Federal government organizations. Due to thenumber of commenters, and the similarity of many of their comments, individualcommenters will not be identified by name for each issue. 1. <T3>Protocol not peer-reviewed or validated.</T3> Several commenters statedthat the proposed protocol is unacceptable because it was neither peer-reviewednor validated. One commenter stated that the anaerobic biodegradation protocolhas not been subjected to the rigorous internal and external peer reviewthat is usually required of TSCA test guidelines. Another commenter statedthat manufacturers would be unwilling to undertake validation of this protocolat this stage of development.In response, EPA notes that this protocol for obtaining microbiologicaltransformation rate data for chemicals in the subsurface environment representsinput from government, industry, and academic scientists who attended aworkshop on methods to evaluate microbiological process rates, held in1986. The protocol was developed based on ideas presented by attendeesof this workshop. Also, the purpose of proposing the test protocol in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> was to solicit a peer review. This process hasgiven the public the opportunity to review the documents that support thisprotocol; in addition, procedures used in the protocol are in current practiceas parts of other peer-reviewed protocols, and have appeared in journalsand are referenced in the text of this rulemaking.2. <T3>Use of established protocols.</T3> Several commenters suggested thatthe proposed biodegradation protocol be abandoned in favor of other establishedprotocols.The Agency disagrees. The objective of the proposed protocol is to provideanaerobic biodegradation rate constants for chemicals in wastes. Theserates will be used in EPA's subsurface fate and transport model to evaluatethe potential risk to human health and the environment from migration ofthese chemicals in subsurface conditions prevalent in the United States.The alternative protocols (40 CFR 796.3150; FIFRA Pesticide Guideline SubdivisionN, October 1982, Guideline 1672-2; OECD Guideline 304a, anaerobic) thathave been suggested do not meet these conditions. Each of the alternativeprotocols either: (1) Does not use subsurface materials representing subsurfacein-situ conditions as their microbial source; (2) was not developed toproduce rate data but was qualitative in nature (except for OECD Guideline304a); (3) does not provide biodegradation rate constants representativeof varying subsurface environmental conditions in the United States; and/or(4) adds nutrients to enhance activity, which may lead to a significantoverestimation of biodegradation potential.3. <T3>Cost of conducting test is ``prohibitive'', and was underestimated.</T3>According to several commenters, the cost of implementing the proposedanaerobic biodegradation guidelines is prohibitive. They also believe thatthe economic impact analysis performed for the tests substantially underestimatesthe real costs to conduct the studies. In addition, according to severalcommenters, costs of biomass measurements, test concentration determinations,travel, equipment associated with soil and groundwater sampling, and thecost of locating sampling sites were not factored into the economic impactanalysis performed by the Agency.EPA has estimated the costs of the proposed protocol and assessed the impactof the testing costs on each chemical. The cost of the testing was notfound to be prohibitive. The economic analysis accompanying this rulemakingcontains a more complete discussion of this conclusion.Biomass measurements were not included in the cost estimate for the proposedrule; however, the cost of conducting the test has been reestimated forthe final rule, and this new cost reflects the cost of the requisite biomassmeasurements. In addition, costs for analytical chemistry determinationshave been added to the test cost estimate for the final rule. The revisedanalysis was made available for public comment on January 14, 1988 (53FR 911).EPA believes that the costs of test concentration determinations will berelatively small. According to andSection; 795.54(b)(2)(iii) of the proposedrule, the test concentration determinations are based upon two factors,the health-based level and the chemical's solubility. In many cases, thesedata will be readily available and there will be no cost involved in theirdetermination. In some cases, the health-based level will be determinedand/or the chemical's solubility will be estimated. The costs for thesedeterminations will be small.The costs associated with sample collection (specifically, travel, equipmentassociated with sampling, and the cost of locating sampling sites) arenow also included in the cost estimate for the test protocol in the finalrule.4. <T3>Rate of anaerobic vs. aerobic degradation.</T3> The assumption thatanaerobic biodegradation is slower than aerobic metabolism and that anaerobicrates can be used as a conservative estimate for biodegradation was challengedby several commenters.The Agency agrees that anaerobic activity is not always the slowest activity,but it is less likely that data collected under anaerobic conditions wouldlead to an overestimation of the degradation rate. In the subsurface, aerobicdegradation is probably controlled by the influx of oxygen. Thus, the masstransport of oxygen would be the rate limiting step. In the laboratory,oxygen would probably not be the rate limiting step, so degradation ratesobtained in the laboratory are likely to be overestimated. Anaerobic processesare not as easily mass transport-limited, and the degradation rate determinedin the laboratory could be equal to, or an underestimation of, the actualdegradation rate. The Agency maintains that the use of degradation datafrom anaerobic processes are more appropriate for obtaining modeling informationthat can be used to protect human health and the environment.5. <T3>Results would be site-specific.</T3> One commenter said that the resultsof the testing are likely to be site-specific and only indicative of theparticular site tested. This would prevent the results of the testing frombeing useful to the manufacturers; they would be useful only to the Agency'simplementation of the subsurface fate and transport model.The study would be site-specific if only one site were selected for thestudy. Six sites (having a range of characteristics) are required by theprotocol to provide a spectrum of data that provide a range of biodegradationrates expected to be encountered in the subsurface environments of theUnited States. The subsurface in-situ biodegradation rate for a chemicalconstituent depends on, among other factors, Eh, pH, temperature, concentrationof the chemical in ground water, and soil microorganisms.6. <T3>Justification of site/sample collection.</T3> Several commenters didnot find that EPA had sufficiently justified the requirement for six samplesfrom six sites, saying that the testing routine is impractical, unnecessary,and will not yield the best information.Six sites (which have a range of characteristics) were selected to providea spectrum of data that could provide a range of biodegradation rates tobe encountered in subsurface environments in the United States. This matrixof biodegradation rates will be used in a subsurface fate and transportmodel. A nation-wide simulation of the subsurface environmental conditionsis needed because the waste containing a chemical constituent can potentiallybe managed anywhere in the country. The subsurface fate and transport modelis implemented to simulate the nation-wide subsurface conditions usingthe Monte Carlo procedure. The Monte Carlo procedure utilizes these biodegradationrates to represent the subsurface environmental conditions in the country.Ideally, samples from more than six sites are preferred. However, becauseof the projected burden on the manufacturers of chemicals, the consensusof the biodegradation workshop, comprised of industrial, academic, andgovernment representatives, was that six sites should be adequate. Thecharacteristics of these sites were also developed by the attendees ofthe workshop. Although the Agency recognizes that it is difficult to identifysix sites, it was the consensus of the workshop that six sites could beidentified by researching available hydrogeological information from theU.S. Geological Survey as well as State and County geological and groundwatersurvey reports.7. <T3>Influence of biotransformation on chemical fate.</T3> Biotransformationwill influence the fate of some organic contaminants; this process hasnot been considered sufficiently in the proposed guidelines, accordingto several commenters.The Agency agrees that biotransformation can result in the alteration ofthe original chemical, producing intermediates. The formation of degradationintermediates should be quantified in microcosm assays for test chemicalsthat can potentially be transformed to other test chemicals subject tothis rule. Table 2 is a list of chemicals which should be analyzed forthe specified intermediates. Analysis for degradation intermediates isindicated when the level of test chemical has been reduced by more than25 percent.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,r10</C><T4>Table</T4> 2._<T4>Required Product Analysis</T4><H1>Test chemical</H1><H1>Potential product</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Trichloromethanethiol<D>Methanethiol.</D><P>Chloromethane (methyl chloride).</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pentachlorobenzene<D>1,2-Dichlorobenzene.</D><P>1,3-Dichlorobenzene.</P><P>1,4-Dichlorobenzene.</P><P>1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene.</P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bromoform<D>1,2-Dibromomethane.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene<D>1,2-Dichlorobenzene.</D><P>1,3-Dichlorobenzene.</P><P>1,4-Dichlorobenzene.</P></ITAG></ITAG>8. <T3>Interpretation of data under conditions of rapid decay or nutrient-limitation.</T3>The manner in which data will be interpreted in the event that decay isvery rapid or in cases where a system becomes nutrient-limited was notaddressed in the proposed rule, according to one commenter.The Agency will interpret biotransformation rate data as described in theproposed rule at 52 FR 20354, May 29, 1987. Where decay is very rapid,the number of samples to be analyzed will be reduced and the cost of testingfor that chemical will also be reduced. For those chemicals on Table 2which degrade rapidly, samples will also be analyzed for the appropriateintermediates.The subsurface environment is generally nutrient-limited. The additionof nutrients would lead to enhanced degradation rates that would not berepresentative of actual subsurface conditions.9. <T3>Discrepancy in number of samples collected.</T3> Several commentersnoted a discrepancy in the number of samples to be collected for the requiredanalysis.The Agency agrees with this comment. The discrepancy in the number of sampleshas been corrected to indicate that two samples will be collected fromeach site. Data will be reported for each of the two samples from the sixdifferent sites (a total of 12 subsurface samples).10. <T3>More quality assurance.</T3> Several commenters noted that there needsto be more quality assurance on analytical procedures, i.e., methods ofanalysis for each chemical should be specified.The Agency agrees that quality assurance must be part of any testing program.A biodegradation laboratory work conducted should follow EPA's TSCA GoodLaboratory Practice standards (40 CFR Part 792). The appropriate analyticalmethods for measuring the degradation of a given chemical will depend onthe concentration of the test chemical and the subsurface material beingused. Thus, it would be difficult if not impossible for the Agency to identifya method or series of methods for each chemical. To ensure that the selectedtechniques are appropriate, the reporting of certain quality assurancedata, such as reproducibility, precision, and recovery have been addedto the protocol.11. <T3>Number of samples required.</T3> One commenter said that too many samplesare required for this protocol, while others indicated that there was confusionas to how many microcosms were needed.The Agency agrees that the protocol as written in the proposed rule wasconfusing as to number of microcosms required. The following flow chart(Table 3) clearly illustrates the number of microcosms necessary to testa chemical.Table 3._Required Number of Microcosm Assays for Each Chemical<ITAG tagnum="16">Six Sites</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(x Two samples per site)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">12 Samples</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(x Two for sulfate and methanogenic conditions)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">24 Microcosms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(x Two for control and active microcosms)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">48 Microcosms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(x Three for three concentrations)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">144 Microcosms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">(x Six for six times periods)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16"/><T3>864=Total Number of Active and Control Microcosms</T3>12. <T3>Determination of minimum concentration.</T3> Several commenters questionedthe Agency's selection of 22.5 as the multiplier for the health-based levelleading to the minimum concentration. Others stated that it is inappropriateto choose a lower level assay on the basis of a health-based level, andthat the selection of a low level assay 22.5 times th health-based levelwas not justified.The minimum concentration is the permissible leachate concentration thatcan be released from a waste disposal site as determined by the EPA modelingapproach. Concentrations below this figure would constitute a permissiblerelease and therefore microbiological data would not be needed. The figureof 22.5 was the estimated multiplier to determine the permissible concentrationof a contaminant that can leach from a disposal site. The number 22.5 hasbeen revised and the updated multiplier will be 30.13. <T3>Measure of anaerobicity.</T3> Several commenters noted that the testdoes not require a measure of anaerobicity and is not designed to ensurethat anaerobicity will be maintained in samples. The Agency agrees with these commenters and has added a measure of anaerobicityto the protocol. 14. <T3>Development of aerobic and microaerophyllic test systems.</T3> Twocommenters encouraged EPA to develop aerobic and microaerophyllic testsystems in addition to developing an anaerobic biodegradation protocol,saying that these mechanisms are important subsurface attenuation processesand their inclusion would improve anaerobic biodegradation modeling results.The Agency agrees that aerobic and microaerophyllic processes are important.However, as explained in Unit II.C.4. of this preamble, aerobic degradationrates obtained in the laboratory are often overestimations of actual subsurfaceaerobic rates. The Agency maintains that modeling subsurface environmentalconditions using anaerobic degradation rates is more appropriate and thatuse of the modeling results based on the anaerobic degradation rates forthe development of regulations will be more protective of human healthand the environment.15. <T3>Inclusion of a denitrifying condition.</T3> One commenter suggestedthat the rule would be improved if a denitrifying condition was includedin the testing.The Agency has not found denitrifying conditions to be representative ofthe majority of disposal sites in the United States. In addition, denitrifyingconditions can lead to more rapid rates of biodegradation for many chemicals.Overestimation of biodegradation rates is inconsistent with the Agency'sobjective of protecting human health and the environment. 16. <T3>Identification of units for reporting results.</T3> One commenter askedthat the units for reporting degradation rate, and characteristics of subsurfaceand groundwater should be stated clearly. The Agency agrees, and the protocol has been modified to identify the unitsfor reporting data in the protocol; e.g., residual test chemical (mg/gmdry wt. sediment), redox potential (Eh, standard hydrogen electrode [SHE]),dissolved oxygen (mg/L), etc. 17. <T3>Volatile chemicals.</T3> One commenter said that bottles should befilled to the top for volatile chemicals. The Agency agrees with this comment. The protocol has been amended to indicatethat for all volatile and non-volatile chemicals, the assay bottles shouldbe filled to the top, while maintaining the ratio of dry weight of sedimentto volume. Nonvolatile chemicals are included in this amendment, to avoiddiscrepancy as to what is or is not considered volatile. 18. <T3>Clarification of ``dry weight''. </T3>One commenter asked that theAgency clarify the term ``dry weight.''The term has been modified in the protocol to mean oven dry weight (103anddegrees;C). 19. <T3>Biomass measurements.</T3> Several commenters said that there was nojustification provided for requiring biomass measurements in the protocol.The Agency agrees. Biomass measurements were included to ensure comparabilityof results between subsurface material samples. Rate constants from sedimentsamples having significantly high or low bacterial populations would beconsidered suspect. In addition, the ratio of sulfate-reducting and methanogenicorganisms are indicative of redox potential of the environment. The protocolhas been modified to reflect this.20. <T3>Adaptation period.</T3> Two commenters questioned how the adaptationperiod is to be used in this protocol.The adaptation period is the length of time before biodegradation of thechemical is observed. The adaptation period will be subtracted from thesampling time in which less than 5 percent of the original substrate isdetected. This difference will be divided by two to obtain a conservativehalf-life. This method will be used to determine half-life in the eventthat insufficient data for half-life determination are obtained duringtesting.21. <T3>Total organic carbon.</T3> One commenter requested that total organiccarbon be analyzed as part of the protocol.The Agency agrees and has added the analysis of total organic carbon tothe protocol.22. <T3>Choice of 1.0 mL sample size, and dilution series.</T3> One commenterquestioned the selection of a 1 milliliter (mL) sample size, and the dilutionseries included in the protocol for enumeration of heterotrophic bacteria.Sample sizes are chosen which are large enough to ensure a representativesample, yet small enough to be practical. The Agency has reviewed the samplingprocedure in the protocol, and has changed the initial sampling size from1 mL to 10 mL to ensure that a representative sample is obtained.Due to the change in initial sampling size, the dilution series describedin the revised protocol differs from the series described in the proposedprotocol by a power of ten. The dilution series described in the protocolis a recommended guideline; however, it is the responsibility of the laboratoryscientist to obtain the correct dilution series for bacterial enumeration.23. <T3>Use of Wilson method.</T3> Two commenters noted that the use of themethod described by Wilson et al., does not preclude oxygen from the subsurfacematerial.This method has been replaced by an updated method that prevents oxygencontamination of subsurface material, and is reflected in the revised protocol.This updated method is described in Zapico et al. (Ref. 36).24. <T3>Use of positive control.</T3> Several commenters suggested that theAgency include a positive control in the protocol.The Agency disagrees with this comment. A positive control is used to indicateif general microbial activity is present in the sediment. An indicationof general microbial activity can be obtained by measuring the quantityof microorganisms in the aquifer material. This procedure is already includedin the protocol.25. <T3>Assumption of aerobic metabolism. </T3>One commenter stated that theassumption that ``two parts of oxygen are required to completely metabolizeone part of an organic compound'' may not be conservative.The Agency disagrees. The assumption of two parts of oxygen is appropriateif one is not attempting to underestimate the approximate ratio. However,the Agency has removed reference to this ratio from the protocol to avoidmisinterpretation.26. <T3>Use of Teflon</T3><T4>#</T4><T3>-coated silica septa. </T3>Several commenters stated that it was amistake to specify that Teflon<T4>#</T4>-coated silica septa be used, because such septa do not maintainanaerobic conditions.The Agency agrees that Teflon<T4>#</T4>-coated septa are inappropriate if samples are to be stored outsideof an anaerobic chamber, and the protocol has been amended to require theuse of 0.5 to 1 cm thick butyl rubber stoppers coated with Teflon<T4>#</T4>. The requirement to incubate bottles upside down has also beenremoved from the protocol.27. <T3>Guidelines for sulfidogenic and methanogenic enumeration techniques.</T3>One commenter noted that the protocol contained elaborate descriptionsof more common laboratory techniques, while guidelines for sulfidogenicand methanogenic enumeration techniques are only referenced.EPA has provided references for two anaerobic enumeration techniques, anddoes not believe it is necessary to describe them in detail in the protocol.Sulfidogenic enumeration techniques are described in Pankhurst (1971; Ref.47), and methanogenic enumeration techniques are described in Jones etal. (1982; Ref. 48).28. <T3>Cutoff levels. </T3>One commenter questioned the 5 percent and 64-weekcutoff levels.If the cut-off level is 5 percent and the reaction gets to 6 percent andthe chemical does not degrade further, the protocol would then be completed.The Agency acknowledges that no matter what cut-off point is established,the problem of what should happen if degradation approaches the point butdoes not surpass it still exists. The 5 percent cut-off level was selectedto ensure that degradation of the chemical was essentially complete, andthat the reaction did not simply stop when only a portion of the test chemicalhad been degraded.29. <T3>Kinetics. </T3>One commenter questioned why kinetics are not obtained,saying that this will result in limited utility of test findings.The protocol was designed to develop degradation rates that can be usedto model environmental conditions so that regulations can be developedwhich are protective of human health and the environment. A conservativehalf-life for degradation of a chemical can be estimated by dividing bytwo the difference between the last sampling time where no detectable degradationhad occurred and the sampling time where less than 5 percent of the originalsubstrate is detected. The adaptation period would then be the time overwhich no detectable degradation of the chemical was observed. This pointhas been further clarified in the final protocol.30. <T3>Loss of chemical: Measurement. </T3>One commenter said that the lossof a chemical should not be equated to carbon dioxide and methane production.The Agency agrees with this comment. The stoichiometry of conversion ofthe subject chemicals to methane and carbon dioxide is unknown. Therefore,it would not be possible to determine the residual levels of a chemicalfrom carbon dioxide and methane measurements. The amount of residual testchemical will be measured directly.31. <T3>Adequacy of enumeration techniques. </T3>One commenter said that enumerationtechniques may be inadequate.The Agency recognizes that no enumeration technique is completely accurate.However, if they are consistent from one study to the next, those datacan be used in a qualitative manner to indicate the reproducibility ofthe subsurface samples used in estimating the degradation of the differentchemicals to be analyzed. The enumeration of microorganisms in this protocolis primarily for quality assurance and quality control.32. <T3>Organisms from overlying strata. </T3>One commenter questioned whetherorganisms from overlying strata would interfere with the protocol.The purpose of the protocol is to determine the degradation of organicchemicals in subsurface materials. The Agency believes that whether ornot the organisms in that material come from the overlying strata is irrelevant.33. <T3>Modified sampling technique. </T3>A modified sampling technique, developedat the Agency's Environmental Research Laboratory in Ada, Oklahoma, willbe presented at the National Water Well Association's Second Outdoor Actionand Aquifer Restoration Conference, May 23-26, 1988. Briefly, the modificationconsists of alterations to hollow-stem auger equipment. A unique samplingtool, referred to as the ``Waterloo Cohesionless-Aquifer Core Barrel,''for sampling heaving saturated material has been redesigned so the internalvacuum piston can be used in the 4-inch O.D. sample tube. The major alterationsconsist of a clam-shell cap which is fitted to the bottom of the hollow-stemauger bit replacing the standard center plug. This device serves as a plugfor the hollow-stem auger while drilling to a desired depth. Undisturbedsamples are collected by lowering the sample tube into the hollow augerto the closed clam shell, retracting the auger about one foot_thereby openingthe clam shell_and then driving the sample tube to the desired depth witha rig-mounted percussion hammer. The redesigned internal piston insidethe sample tube is held stationary by a wire line rigidly fixed to therig. Holding the piston stationary while lowering the sampler creates avacuum on the noncohesive sample, holding it in the tube during retrievalfrom the borehole.After retrieval, the piston is removed, the sampler is mounted in a hydraulicextruder, and samples are pressed from the tube through an attached paringdevice inside an aseptic glove-box. The glove-box is designed with a regulatednitrogen flow-through purging system and with a diaphragm port where thesampler can be inserted prior to sample extrusion.Although EPA did not receive comment on the sampling techniques recommendedin the protocol, the Agency is making this information on the modifiedsampling technique available for the benefit of those who decide to conductthe biodegradation study. For further information on this technique, contactEPA, as directed by this preamble.D. Economic IssuesSeveral commenters to this rule (Olin Chemicals, Lonza, Inc., Morton Thiokol,Inc., Velsicol Chemical Corp., Monsanto Co., Dow Chemical Co., EastmanKodak Co., and Regulatory Network, Inc.; Refs. 22, 15, 19, 32, 18, 8, 9,and 16, respectively) submitted data about specific chemicals, including:phosgene, paraldehyde, malononitrile, 2-picoline, bis(2-chloroethoxy) methane,endrin, hexachlorophene, <T3>p</T3>-nitrophenol, <T3>p</T3>-nitroaniline, benzal chloride, 2,3-dichloro-1-propanol, <T3>p</T3>-benzoquinine, and maleic anhydride. These data have been incorporatedin the economic analysis accompanying this final rule. Other non-chemicalspecific comments are addressed below.1. The economic analysis accompanying the proposed rule addressed only49 of 73 chemicals included in the rule (CMA; Ref. 2). In this final rule,testing is required and/or recommended for 33 chemicals. Each of thesechemicals has been addressed in the economic analysis for the proposedrule or in the revised economic analysis included in the record upon thereopening of the public comment period on January 14, 1988 (53 FR 911).2. The Agency cannot justify a test rule for chemicals for which insufficienteconomic data is available to determine potential economic impact (CMA;Ref. 2). No chemicals for which insufficient economic data are availableare included in this final rule.3. The economic impacts upon manufacturers of byproducts, impurities, andother inadvertent chemicals have not been considered (CMA; Ref. 2). Nochemicals identified as chemicals that are manufactured solely as an impurityare included in this final rule. The economic impacts upon manufacturersof byproducts have been included in the economic analysis for each chemicalidentified as being manufactured solely as a byproduct.4. The Agency must conduct additional analyses beyond the reliance upondirect cost reviews (CMA, Monsanto; Refs. 2 and 18). The Agency disagreesthat a more in-depth analysis is necessary for every chemical includedin this rule. The economic analysis for this final rule includes a morein-depth analysis where appropriate. The proposed rule specifically askedfor public comment on individual chemicals to assist in the evaluationof significant adverse economic impact. In each case in which such informationwas submitted, that information has been incorporated into the economicassessment for this final rule. In addition, for each chemical for whichthe probability of adverse economic impact was determined to be high, orfor which insufficient information was available at the time of the proposedrule, additional information has been gathered and incorporated into theeconomic analysis for this final rule. In sum, the Agency disagrees thatsuch information is required in each and every case. For those specificchemicals for which commenters supplied information, or for which the economicanalysis indicated a high probability of adverse impact, a greater levelof detail has been incorporated into the final analysis.5. The economic analysis underestimated the potential economic impact fromthe rule because the testing costs are annualized over 15 years. Companiesrequired to test will incur these costs over a two-year period, and therefore,the economic analysis underestimates the economic impact of the rule (SOCMA;Ref. 27). This commenter fails to draw a critical distinction between themanner in which firms will pay for testing and the manner in which firmswill recover the costs of testing. The method incorporated in the economicanalysis of this test rule is aimed at determining the latter_the increasein price necessary to recover the testing cost over the life of each chemicalproduct affected by testing. The commenter instead refers to the former_theaccounting method employed to pay for the tests. In the economic analysis,test costs are annualized over the assumed market life of the product,to estimate the amount which a firm would have to increase product pricein order to recover the testing cost. As explained in the economic analysis,this estimate of product price increase is used as an indicator of thelikelihood of adverse economic impact.6. EPA has not fulfilled its responsibility to show the availability oftesting facilities to conduct the biodegradation test (Olin, Dow; Refs.22 and 8). In response to this comment, EPA has conducted a survey of testinglaboratories (Ref. 37) to determine their capability and likely capactityto conduct the biodegradation test according to the protocol finalizedin this rule. The conclusion of this survey is that several laboratoriesare indeed available to conduct the test at costs comparable to those estimatedby EPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Final Test Rule</ITAG>A.

Data document the presence of certain chemicalsin waste streams and/or ground water, demonstrating potential for humanexposure (53 FR 911; January 14, 1988). The data show that tens of thousandsof pounds of these chemicals are being released annually via disposal.Also, the type of disposal described in the data bases for the subjectchemicals, such as deepwell injection, discharge to landfill, or dischargeto a POTW (publicly-owned treatment works), indicate potential for leachingand exposure to these chemicals. Indeed, data exist for many of the chemicalsthat document incidents in which the chemicals have migrated from theirplace of treatment, storage, or ultimate disposal. It is likely that thesedata represent only a portion of actual contamination occurrences throughoutthe country. Therefore, EPA believes that these chemicals meet the requirements fortesting under section 4(a)(1)(A)(i) of TSCA. By virtue of these chemicalsbeing identified as ``hazardous constituents,'' the nature of potentialtoxicity, the presence and evidence of these chemicals in the waste streamsof treatment, storage, or disposal facilities, evidence that existing landfillsleak, and the potential for human exposure to these chemicals during treatment,storage, and disposal activities and through possible leaching or volatilization,the Agency has determined that the disposal of these chemicals may presentan unreasonable risk of injury to human health. A detailed discussion ofsection 4(a)(1)(A)(i) requirements is contained in Unit II.A.2. of thispreamble. 2. <T3>Insufficient data to determine or predict. </T3>All of the chemicalsincluded in this rule have been the subject of a thorough search of thepublished literature and all standard on-line data bases used by differentEPA program offices, including the Toxic Substances Control Act Test Submissions(TSCATS) data base, which identifies data submitted under TSCA section8(d). The chemicals designated for testing in Table 4 are those for whichno acceptable data were found. Specific reasons why data were consideredto be inadequate are contained in the health effects and chemical fateLiterature Search Results and Critique documents in the public record forthis rule. Therefore, under section 4(a)(1)(A)(ii) of TSCA, the Agency has determinedthat, for each chemical examined, there are insufficient data upon whichthe effects of disposal of the subject chemicals on human health can bereasonably determined or predicted. 3. <T3>Testing is necessary. </T3>EPA believes that the testing of the subjectchemicals is necessary to determine or predict the effects of disposalof these chemicals on human health so that the Agency can establish concentrationlevels below which a waste would no longer be considered hazardous underSubtitle C of RCRA. In the concentration-based listing effort, the Agency will use health effectsand chemical fate data on each of the waste constituents to predict theconcentration limit that would be the basis for defining the waste as hazardousunder Subtitle C of RCRA. Therefore, EPA finds under section 4(a)(1)(A)(iii) of TSCA that the testingof the chemicals included in this final rule is needed, and that the requiredhealth effects and chemical fate studies are capable of developing thenecessary information to assess the effects of disposal. EPA also findsthat the data resulting from the required studies will be relevant to determiningwhether the disposal of each chemical presents an unreasonable risk ofinjury to human health. B. Required and Recommended Testing and Test Standards On the basis of these findings, EPA is requiring health effects testingand/or specific chemical fate testing for the chemicals subject to thisfinal rule (see Unit III.A. of this preamble). The chemicals and the specifictests are listed in Table 4, along with a test that is recommended (biodegradation),but not required. The required tests are to be conducted in accordancewith: (1) EPA's TSCA Good Laboratory Practice Standards in 40 CFR Part792; and (2) the specific TSCA test guidelines as enumerated in 40 CFRParts 796 and 798, as amended in this rule. The optional biodegradationtest, if conducted, should be conducted in accordance with the EPA-developedguideline, 40 CFR Part 795.54, finalized in this rule. EPA is requiring that the chemicals listed in Table 4 under SubchronicTesting be tested using the guideline at 40 CFR 798.2650. The subchronicstudies will be performed by the oral gavage route. The rat will be thetest species. EPA requires that the chemicals listed in Table 4 under Soil Sorption Testingbe tested using the guideline at 40 CFR 796.2750_<T3>Sediment and soil adsorption isotherm. </T3>EPA further requires that the chemicals listed in Table 4 under HydrolysisTesting be tested using the guideline at 40 CFR 796.3500_<T3>Hydrolysis as a function of pH at 25 anddegrees;C, </T3>as modified inthis rule. These modifications do not apply to the hydrolysis test requirementsof previous rules, such as for anthraquinone. To make this clear, languagehas been added to the codified portion of this rule stating that the guidelinesand other test methods cited in the anthraquinone test rule are referencedas they existed on July 20, 1987. The Agency is requiring that the above-referenced health effects and chemicalfate test guidelines specified in III.B., and any modifications to thoseguidelines, be the test standards for the purposes of the required andoptional testing for these chemicals. The EPA test guidelines for chemicalfate and human health effects testing specify generally accepted minimumconditions for determining chemical fate and human health toxicities forsubstances such as the subject OSW chemicals to which humans may be exposed.Persons manufacturing or processing the 32 chemicals for which biodegradationtesting is recommended, as indicated in Table 4, have the option of performingthe test according to the EPA-developed guideline at 40 CFR 795.54, finalizedin this rule, or not performing the test and having EPA assume ``zero biodegradation''when formulating regulatory requirements for land disposal of hazardouswastes. A discussion of why this test is optional, rather than required,is contained in Unit II.A.11. of this preamble. The guideline was developedby EPA to obtain information on the biodegradation of chemicals in thesubsurface environment.C. Test Substances EPA is requiring that the test substance in the required studies for eachof the chemicals subject to this test rule be of at least 98 percent purity.The Agency has specified relatively pure substances for testing becauseit is interested in evaluating the effects attributable to the subjectchemicals themselves. This requirement lessens the likelihood that anyeffects seen are due to other chemicals that may be present. D. Persons Required to Test Section 4(b)(3)(B) specifies that the activities for which EPA makes section4(a) findings (manufacture, processing, distribution in commerce, use,and/or disposal) determine who bears the responsibility for testing a chemical.Manufacturers and persons who intend to manufacture a chemical are requiredto test if the findings are based on manufacturing (``manufacture'' isdefined in section 3(7) of TSCA to include ``import''). Processors andpersons who intend to process the chemical are required to test if thefindings are based on processing. Manufacturers and processors and personswho intend to nanufacture and process a chemical, are required to testif the exposure giving rise to the potential risk occurs during distributionin commerce, use, or disposal of a chemical. Because EPA has found that existing data are inadequate to assess the healthrisks from the continued disposal of the chemicals subject to this testrule, EPA is requiring that persons who manufacture, import, and/or process,including byproduct manufacture (defined in 40 CFR 791.3), or who intendto manufacture or process these chemicals at any time from the effectivedate of the final test rule to the end of the reimbursenent period be subjectto the testing requirements contained in this final rule. The end of thereimbursement period will be 5 years after the last final report is submittedor an amount of time equal to that which was required to develop data,if more than 5 years after the submission of the last final report requiredunder the test rule. Because TSCA contains provisions to avoid duplicative testing, not everyperson subject to this rule must individually conduct testing. Section4(b)(3)(A) of TSCA provides that EPA may permit two or more manufacturersor processors who are subject to this rule to designate one such personor a qualified third person to conduct the tests and submit data on theirbehalf. Section 4(c) provides that any person required to test may applyto EPA for an exemption from the requirement. EPA promulgated proceduresfor applying for TSCA section 4(c) exemptions in 40 CFR Part 790. Manufacturers (including importers) subject to this rule are required tosubmit either a letter of intent to perform testing or an exemption applicationwithin 30 days after the effective date of the final test rule. The requiredprocedures for submitting such letters and applications are described in40 CFR Part 790. Processors subject to this rule, unless they are also manufacturers, willnot be required to submit letters of intent or exemption applications,or to conduct testing, unless manufacturers fail to submit notices of intentto test or later fail to sponsor the required tests. The Agency expectsthat the manufacturers will pass an appropriate portion of the costs oftesting on to processors through the pricing of their products or reimbursementmechanisms. If manufacturers perform all the required tests, processorswill be granted exemptions automatically. If manufacturers fail to submitnotices of intent to test or fail to sponsor all the required tests, theAgency will publish a separate notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>to notify processors to respond; this procedureis described in 40 CFR Part 790. EPA is not requiring the submission of equivalence data as a conditionfor exemption from the required testing for the chemicals subject to thisfinal test rule. As noted in Unit III.C. of this preamble, EPA is interestedin evaluating the effects attributable to each of the chemicals themselvesand has specified relatively pure substances for testing. Manufacturers and processors subject to this test rule must comply withthe test rule development and exemption procedures in 40 CFR Part 790 forsingle-phase rulemaking. This does not include manufacturers and processorsof the nine chemicals for which no testing is required, but is recommended(biodegradation). For those who decide to conduct the optional biodegradation test, EPA requestsnotification, either in the letter of intent to conduct the required testingor a separate letter, that biodegradation testing will be conducted. E. Reporting Requirements EPA requires that all data developed under this rule be reported in accordancewith its TSCA Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) Standards, which appear in40 CFR Part 792. In accordance with 40 CFR Part 790 under single-phase rulemaking procedures,test sponsors are required to submit individual study plans at least 45days prior to the initiation of each test. EPA is required by TSCA section 4(b)(1)(C) to specify the time period duringwhich persons subject to a test rule must submit test data. Specific reportingrequirements for each of the required (and optional) test standards areas follows: The 90-day subchonic toxicity study on each of the designated chemicalsshall be completed and the final results submitted to the Agency within12 months of the effective date of the final test rule.The soil sorption study on the designated chemicals shall be completedand the final results submitted to the Agency within 9 months of the effectivedate of the final test rule.The hydrolysis studies on the designated chemicals shall be completed andthe final results submitted to the Agency within 6 months of the effectivedate of the final test rule. A progress report on the subchronic toxicity and biodegradation tests willbe required every 6 months from the effective date of the final rule untilsubmission of the final report. TSCA section 14(b) governs Agency disclosure of all test data submittedpursuant to section 4 of TSCA. Upon receipt of data required by this rule,the Agency will publish a notice of receipt in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>as required by section 4(d). Persons who export a chemical substance or mixture subject to a section4 test rule are subject to the export reporting requirement of TSCA section12(b). Final regulations interpreting the requirement of section 12(b)are in 40 CFR Part 707. In brief, as of the effective date of this testrule, an exporter of any of the chemicals listed at 40 CFR 790.5055(c)must report to EPA the first annual export of the chemical to any one country.EPA will notify the foreign country about the test rule for the chemical.If a person decides to conduct the optional biodegradation study on a chemical,the person should notify EPA. Testing should begin within 4 months of theeffective date of the final rule and the final results of the study shouldbe submitted to the Agency within 6 months of the completion date of thestudy, but not exceed 25 months from the effective date of the final rule.Persons who decide not to conduct the test should notify EPA of this decisionin writing within 4 months of the effective date of the final rule. Thisletter implies acknowledgement that EPA will assume ``zero biodegradation''for purposes of concentration-based listing of the chemical. F. Enforcement Provisions The Agency considers failure to comply with any aspect of a section 4 ruleto be a violation of section 15 of TSCA. Section 15(1) of TSCA makes itunlawful for any person to fail or refuse to comply with any rule or orderissued under section 4. Section 15(3) of TSCA makes it unlawful for anyperson to fail or refuse to: (1) Establish or maintain records, (2) submitreports, notices, or other information, or (3) permit access to or copyingof records required by TSCA or any regulation or rule issued under TSCA.Additionally, TSCA section 15(4) makes it unlawful for any person to failor refuse to permit entry or inspection as required by TSCA section 11.Section 11 applies to any ``establishment, facility, or other premisesin which chemical substances or mixtures are manufactured, processed, stored,or held before or after their distribution in commerce * * *''. The Agencyconsiders a testing facility to be a place where the chemical is held orstored and, therefore, subject to inspection. Laboratory inspections anddata audits will be conducted periodically in accordance with the authorityand procedures outlined in TSCA section 11 by duly designated representativesof the EPA for the purpose of determining compliance with the final rulefor these OSW chemicals. These inspections may be conducted for purposeswhich include verification that testing has begun, schedules are beingmet, and reports accurately reflect the underlying raw data, interpretations,and evaluations, and to deternine compliance with TSCA GLP standards andthe test standards established in the rule. EPA's authority to inspect a testing facility also derives from section4(b)(1) of TSCA, which directs EPA to promulgate standards for the developmentof test data. These standards are defined in section 3(12)(B) of TSCA toinclude those requirements necessary to assure that data developed undertesting rules are reliable and adequate, and to include such other requirementsas are necessary to provide such assurance. The Agency maintains that laboratoryinspections are necessary to provide this assurance. Violators of TSCA are subject to criminal and civil liability. Personswho submit materially misleading or false information in connection withthe requirement of any provision of this rule may be subject to penaltieswhich may be calculated as if they never submitted their data. Under thepenalty provisions of section 16 of TSCA, any person who violates section15 of TSCA could be subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000 for eachviolation, with each day of operation in violation constituting a separateviolation. This provision would be applicable primarily to manufacturersthat fail to submit a letter of intent or an exemption request and thatcontinue manufacturing after the deadlines for such submissions. This provisionwould also apply to processors that fail to submit a letter of intent oran exemption application and continue processing after the Agency has notifiedthem of their obligation to submit such documents (see 40 CFR 790.48(b)).Knowing or willful violations could lead to the imposition of criminalpenalties of up to $25,000 for each day of violation and imprisonment forup to 1 year. In determining the amount of penalty, EPA will take intoaccount the seriousness of the violation and the degree of culpabilityof the violator as well as the other factors listed in TSCA section 16.Other remedies are available to EPA under section 17 of TSCA, such as seekingan injunction to restrain violations of TSCA section 4. Individuals as well as corporations could be subject to enforcement actions.Sections 15 and 16 of TSCA apply to ``any person'' who violates provisionsof TSCA. EPA may, at its discretion, proceed against individuals as wellas companies themselves. In particular, this includes individuals who reportfalse information or who cause it to be reported. In addition, the submissionof false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements is a violation under 18U.S.C. 1001. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Economic Analysis of Final Rule </ITAG>To assess the potential economic impact for this rule, EPA has preparedan economic analysis report, contained in the public record for this rule,that evaluates the potential for significant economic impacts on the industryas a result of the required testing. The economic analysis estimates thecosts of conducting the required and recommended testing for each of the33 chemicals (24 with required and/or recommended testing; 9 recommendedfor optional testing only) and evaluates the potential for significantadverse economic impact as a result of those costs, incorporating an impactmeasure based upon unit test cost as a percent of price. For those chemicalsfor which public comments specifically addressed the potential for economicimpact, that information has been incorporated into the economic analysis.For each chemical for which the costs of testing estimated in the economicanalysis of the proposed rule indicated a high probability of adverse economicimpact, a more detailed assessment has been incorporated into the economicanalysis for this final rule to more precisely determine whether that chemicalhas been classified appropriately. The total testing costs for testing the 33 chemicals are estimated to rangefrom approximately $6.2 million to $8.2 million if companies consent toconduct the optional biodegradation test for each of the 32 chemicals forwhich that test is requested. The total testing costs for the requiredtests alone are estimated to range from $665,000 to $937,000. The estimatedtesting costs for individual chemicals range from $74,000 to $339,000,again, assuming that the biodegradation test is conducted. If some firmsthat are subject to required testing opt not to conduct the biodegradationtest, for some chemicals, testing costs would be as low as $4,300. Seethe economic analysis contained in the public record for this rule forthe estimated testing costs for each chemical. The economic impact analysis indicates that for 28 of the 33 chemicals,the probability of significant adverse economic impact as a result of thetesting costs is very low. Five chemicals have a potential for significantadverse impact on the basis of the estimated testing costs if the manufacturersand processors of each chemical choose to conduct the optional biodegradationtest. If the biodegradation test is not conducted for these five chemicals,only two will have a potential for significant impact. The specific chemicalsfalling into each of these groups may be found in the economic impact analysisin the public docket.Please refer to the economic analysis for a complete discussion of testcost estimation and the potential for economic impact resulting from thesecosts. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Availability of Test Facilities and Personnel </ITAG>Section 4(b)(1) of TSCA requires EPA to consider ``the reasonably foreseeableavailability of the facilities and personnel needed to perform the testingrequired under the rule.'' Therefore, EPA conducted a study to assess theavailability for testing services created by section 4 test rules demands.Copies of the study, Chemical Testing Industry: Profile of ToxicologicalTesting, can be obtained through the National Technical Information Service(NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA 22161 (PB 82-140773). Onthe basis of this study, and a survey of laboratories that can conductthe biodegradation test (Ref. 37), the Agency believes that there willbe available test facilities and personnel to perform the testing specifiedin this rule. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

Other Regulatory Requirements </ITAG>A. Executive Order 12291 Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judge whether a rule is ``major''and therefore subject to the requirement of a Regulatory Impact Analysis.EPA has determined that this test rule is not major because it does notmeet any of the criteria set forth in section 1(b) of the Order; i.e.,it will not have an annual effect on the economy of at least $100 million,will not cause a major increase in costs or prices, and will not have asignificant adverse effect on competition or the ability of U.S. enterpriseto compete with foreign enterprises. This rule was submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) forreview as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written comments fromOMB to EPA, and any EPA response to those comments, are included in therulemaking record. B.

Section 795.54 is added, to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 795.54</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Anaerobic microbiological transformation rate data for chemicalsin the subsurface environment. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Introduction. </T3>(1) This guideline describes laboratory methodsfor developing anaerobic microbiological transformation rate data for organicchemicals in subsurface materials. The method is based on a time-tieredapproach. For chemicals that are degraded rapidly, only a portion (the0, 4, and 8 week sampling periods, for example) of the test will have tobe completed; however, for slowly degrading chemicals, the entire testmay have to be performed (64 weeks). The data will be used to calculatedegradation rate constants for each tested chemical over a range of environmentalconditions. The rate constants obtained from testing will be integratedinto algorithms to assess the fate of organic chemicals leaching into groundwater from waste management facilities. (2) Anaerobic transformations are evaluated under methanogenic and sulfur-reducingconditions. Aerobic biodegradation was not included in the modeling analysisfor two reasons: (i) Aerobic biodegradation would be limited by the concentration of oxygenin ground water. In the laboratory, oxygen would probably not be limiting,and the resulting degradation rates obtained would possibly be overestimationsof actual subsurface degradation rates. (ii) Aerobic degradation would only occur at the leading edge of a contaminantplume where dispersion and other processes dilute the plume with oxygenatedwater, as stated in Wilson et al. (1985), in paragraph (d)(24) of thissection. (3) The anaerobic transformation of chemicals in selected subsurface samplesshall be estimated from subsurface microcosm studies using methods adaptedfrom procedures recently reported by Wilson et al. (1986), in paragraph(d)(25) of this section. These procedures shall be used to determine thelength of the adaptation period (time interval before detectable degradationof the chemical can be observed) and the half-life of the chemical followingthe adaptation period. Supporting laboratory methods shall be used to measurethe levels of residual test chemical, intermediate degradation products,biomass, and other physical-chemical parameters. (b) <T3>Laboratory procedures_</T3>(1) <T3>Identification of subsurface sampling sites, collection of subsurfacematerials, and transportation and storage of subsurface materials._</T3>(i)A minimum of six subsurface sampling sites shall be identified on the basisof two temperatures and three pH values. Three of the sites shall haveannual average temperatures near 10 anddegrees;C, and three of the sitesshall have temperatures near 20 anddegrees;C. These values are chosen torepresent the high and low temperatures commonly observed in aquifers andare one standard deviation on either side of the mean temperature of 15anddegrees;C. Generally, low temperature sites are located in northern latitudeareas of the United States, and high temperatures correspond to southernlatitude areas. (ii) Acidic (pH 4.5 to 6.0), neutral (pH 6.5 to 7.5), and alkaline (pH8.0 to 9.5) sites shall be selected for each temperature range. These rangesof pH values for ground waters are selected to estimate the effect of pHon microbial degradation capacity and to examine the effect of chemicalform on the degradation of chemicals having dissociable hydrogen (i.e.,degradation of the protonated and unprotonated forms of the chemical).Ground waters at all sites shall have dissolved-oxygen levels below 0.1mg/L and sulfate concentrations below 10 mg/L. (iii) Samples of subsurface materials shall be collected in a manner thatprotects them from contamination from surface materials and maintains anaerobicconditions. An appropriate procedure has been reported by Wilson et al.(1983), in paragraph (d)(26) of this section. First, a bore hole is drilledto the desired depth with an auger. Then the auger is removed and the sampletaken with a wireline piston core barrel, as reported by Zapico et al.,1987, in paragraph (d)(14) of this section. The core barrel is immediatelytransferred to an anerobic chamber, filled and continually purged withnitrogen gas, and all further manipulations are performed in the chamber.Using aseptic procedures, up to 5 centimeters (cm) of the core is extruded,then broken off to produce an uncontaminated face. A sterile paring deviceis then installed, and the middle 30 to 35 cm of the core is extruded,paring away the outer 1.0 cm of core material. As a result, the materialthat had been in contact with the core barrel, and thus might be contaminatedwith surface microorganisms, is discarded. Modifications of this techniquecan be used for samples obtained from deep coring devices when auger equipmentis insufficient because of the depth of the aquifer. Subsurface materialshall be stored under nitrogen gas and on ice and shall be used in microcosmstudies within 7 days of collection. (iv) Ground waters will be collected from the bore hole used to collectsubsurface materials. Ground waters will be pumped to the surface. Thebore hole should be purged with argon before pumping begins. The pumpingmechanism should be flushed with enough ground water to insure that a representativeground water sample is obtained. This flushing process generally requiresa volume equal to 3 to 10 times the volume of water in the bore hole. Onceflushing is complete, ground water samples should be collected, and storedunder nitrogen and on ice for transport back to the laboratory. Groundwaters shall be sterilized by filtration through 0.22 micrometer (andCx.18;m)membranes on-site in a portable anaerobic chamber filled and continuallypurged with nitrogen gas. The sterile water shall be stored under nitrogenand on ice, and shall be used in microcosm studies within 7 days of collection.(v) Two samples shall be collected from each of the 6 sites. Each coresample shall be assayed for test chemical degradation and analyzed forbiomass (heterotrophic, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic) and physical-chemicalparameters (pH, cation exchange capacity, total organic carbon, percentbase saturation, percent silt, percent sand, percent clay, redox potential,percent ash-free dry weight). Each corresponding ground water sample willbe analyzed for pH, dissolved oxygen, dissolved organic carbon, nutrients(sulfate, phosphate, nitrate), conductivity, and temperature. (2) <T3>Anaerobic Microcosm assay. </T3>(i) Microcosms shall consist of 160-milliliter(mL) serum bottles which have been filled completely with a slurry of subsurfacematerial and ground water (20 grams equivalent dry wt (oven dry wt. 103anddegrees;C) solid to 80 mL ground water). One series of serum bottles shallbe amended to a level of 200 mg/L sulfate (weight/volume added as sodiumsulfate) to stimulate sulfate-reducing conditions. If the level of solublesulfate falls below 50 mg/L at any sampling time, additional sulfate (200mg/L, weight/volume) should be added to all remaining sulfate-amended microcosms.Soluble sulfate levels should be measured by the method of Watwood et al.(1986), in paragraph (d)(23) of this section. A second series shall beleft unamended to simulate methanogenic conditions. All manipulations inpreparing the microcosms shall be performed aseptically under strict anaerobicconditions, as described in Kaspar and Tiedje (1982) in paragraph (d)(10)of this section, or other equivalent methods, and all equipment in contactwith the subsurface samples shall be sterilized. Sterile controls shallbe prepared by autoclaving the samples for a minimum of 1 hour on eachof 3 consecutive days. Test chemical amendments shall be prepared in sterilenitrogen-purged ground water. Sparingly soluble and volatile chemicalsshall be added to sterile, nitrogen-purged ground water and then stirredovernight without a head space. (ii) The active and control microcosms shall be dosed with the test chemicaland 0.0002 percent (w/v) Resazurin as a redox indicator, and then eachunit shall be immediately sealed with a Teflon<T4>#</T4>-coated gray butyl rubber septum and crimp seal. As stated previously,all manipulations shall be performed under strict anaerobic conditions,as described in Kaspar and Tiedje (1982) in paragraph (d)(10) of this section,or other equivalent methods. The microcosms shall be stored in the darkat the original in-situ temperature. Active microcosms and control microcosms,randomly selected from the sulfate-amended series and the unamended series,shall be sacrificed and analyzed at 0, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 weeks for residualtest chemical and the formation of degradation intermediates. Once theresidual level of the chemical drops below 5 percent of the initial concentration,analysis of microcosms at subsequent time periods is not required. Theactive microcosms and control microcosms from both series, at weeks 0,16, and 64 (or randomly selected from the remaining samples the week following95 percent degradation of the chemical, if less than week 64) shall alsobe analyzed for heterotrophic, sulfate-reducing, and methanogenic bacteria.(iii) Three concentrations of each chemical tested shall be used. The testchemical concentrations should range between a low level of 30 times thehealth-based level and a level that equates to the chemical's solubility(or to a level that causes inhibition of the test chemical's degradation).(iv) Biomass measurements shall be made for heterotrophic, sulfate-reducing,and methanogenic bacteria. Biomass measurements have been included to insurecomparability of results between samples of subsurface materials. Degradationrates derived from sediment samples having significantly high or low (student``t'' test, 90 percent level) bacterial populations would not be consideredin subsequent modeling efforts. Also, the ratio of sulfate-reducing organismsto methanogenic organisms would be used to determine if the dominant redoxconditions were sulfate-reducing or methanogenic. Anaerobic techniquesdescribed by Kaspar and Tiedje (1982), cited in paragraph (d)(10) of thissection, or other equivalent methods, shall be used. (v) Heterotrophic bacterial concentrations shall be measured by a modificationof the procedure developed by Molongoski and Klug (1976) and Clark (1965),cited in paragraphs (d)(13) and (d)(6) of this section, respectively. Aten-mL sample taken from the center of the appropriate microcosm, whichhas been well mixed, shall be aseptically transferred to 100 mL of steriledilution medium and agitated to suspend the organisms. Ten-mL samples shallthen be transferred immediately from the center of the suspension to a90-mL sterile dilution medium blank to give a 10^2 dilution; 10 mL shallbe similarly transferred to another 90-mL of sterile dilution medium toobtain a dilution of 10^3. This process shall be repeated to give a dilutionseries through at least 10^7. Only the 10^1 dilution need be prepared fromcontrol samples. The dilution series can be modified to include dilutionsof greater than 10^7, if necessary, and if sufficient sample is available.From the highest dilution, 0.1-mL portions shall be transferred to thesurface of each of three dilute tryptone glucose extract agar plates. Thesample shall be spread immediately over the surface of the plates; theprocess shall be repeated for lower dilutions. Dilute tryptone glucoseagar plates shall be prepared by combining 24.0 g tryptone glucose extractagar in 1 liter of distilled water. The mixture shall be autoclaved, and25 mL of the molten agar shall be transferred to petri plates. Agar platesshould be stored in an anaerobic chamber for a minimum of 24 hours beforeuse. The inoculated plates shall be incubated in plastic bags in the glovebox, or, if necessary, removed and kept in anaerobic jars. After 14 daysof incubation, the plates shall be examined and the total count per gramof dry sediment material shall be determined. If the plates from the mostdilute sample show more than 300 colonies, the dilution series was inadequate.In this case, all of the plates shall be discarded, and the process shallbe repeated with greater dilutions, as appropriate. (vi) Sulfate-reducing species shall be enumerated by the MPN (most probablenumber) technique as descibed in Pankhurst (1971) in paragraph (d)(15)of this section, or other equivalent method. The dilution series shallbe prepared as described for heterotrophic bacteria. (vii) Methanogenic bacteria shall be enumerated by the MPN technique asdescribed by Jones et al. (1982) in paragraph (d)(9) of this section, orby another equivalent method. The dilution series shall be prepared asdescribed for heterotrophic bacteria. (3) <T3>Analytical measures of the loss of test chemical and intermediate degradationproducts. </T3>(i) The loss of test chemical shall be quantified by measuringthe residual test chemical. The formation of degradation intermediatesshall be quantified in microcosm assays for test chemicals that can potentiallybe transformed. Analysis for degradation intermediates shall be requiredwhen the level of test chemical has been reduced by more than 25 percent.Concentrations of the potential degradation products 1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene,and 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene shall be measured in the appropriate microcosmsused to analyze the degradation of pentachlorobenzene. The concentrationof the potential degradation product dibromomethane shall be measured inthe appropriate microcosms used to analyze the degradation of bromoform.The potential degradation products methanethiol and chloromethane (methylchloride) shall be measured in the appropriate microcosm used to analyzethe degradation of trichloromethanethiol. The potential intermediate products1,2-, 1,3-, and 1,4-dichlorobenzene shall be measured in the appropriatemicrocosm used to analyze the degradation of 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene.(ii) Measurements of test chemical and intermediate degradation productswill require organic analytical techniques tailored to the specific testchemical and subsurface material being investigated. Several extractionand purge-trap techniques are available for the recovery of residual testchemicals and degradative intermediates from subsurface materials. Uniqueanalytical procedures would have to be developed or modified for each testchemical and sediment. The following represent examples of such techniques:(A) Soxlet extraction as described in Anderson et al. (1985), Bossart etal. (1984), Eiceman et al. (1986), Grimalt et al. (1984), and Kjolholt(1985) in paragraphs (d) (2), (3), (7), (8), and (11) of this section,respectively. (B) Shake flask method as described in Brunner et al. (1985), and Russeland McDuffie (1983) in paragraphs (d) (4) and (16) of this section, respectively.(C) Sonification as described in Schellenberg et al. (1984) in paragraph(d)(17) of this section. (D) Homogenization as described in Fowlie and Sulman (1986), Lopez-Avilaet al. (1983), Sims et al. (1982), Stott and Tabatabai (1985), and U.S.EPA (1982) in paragraphs (d) (5), (12), (18), (19), and (22) of this section,respectively. (E) Purge-trap techniques have been described by Wilson et al. (1986) inparagraph (d)(24) of this section. (iii) These procedures can be readily coupled to gas chromatography (GC)and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) procedures to quantify thechemicals of interest. Whatever analytical procedure is selected shallfollow Good Laboratory Practice Standards of 40 CFR Part 792. (4) <T3>Characterization of subsurface materials and ground waters. </T3>(i)Subsurface materials shall be classified, described, and characterizedas to soil type and physical and chemical properties using standard proceduresas described by the Soil Conservation Service (U.S. Department of Agriculture,1972 and 1975) in paragraphs (d) (20) and (21) of this section, or otherequivalent methods. Ten parameters will be measured as follows: (A) Total organic carbon (TOC). (B) pH. (C) Cation exchange capacity. (D) Percent base saturation. (E) Percent silt. (F) Percent sand. (G) Percent clay. (H) Redox potential. (I) Percent ash-free dry weight. (J) Texture. (ii) Ground water shall be characterized for the following, by standardwater and wastewater methods described by the American Public Health Association(1985) in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or other equivalent methods:(A) pH. (B) Dissolved oxygen. (C) Dissolved organic carbon. (D) Nutrients including sulfate, phosphate, and nitrate. (E) Conductivity. (F) Temperature. (iii) The properties of pH, dissolved oxygen, and temperature shall bemeasured at the site of collection. All other properties shall be measuredin the laboratory. (c) <T3>Data to be reported to the Agency. </T3>Data shall be reported forthe two subsurface samples and corresponding ground waters taken from thesix different sampling sites.
