REID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MANILA, Philippines (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Filipinos sat fixated before theirtelevision sets as troops poured automatic fire and rockets into amilitary camp. Was the target Communist or Moslem insurgents? No. Itwas the police.   Later, the hottest topic of newspaper and broadcast commentatorswas a report that hundreds of Uzi submachine guns and Galil rifleswere being imported into a country already awash with weapons.   The importer was the House of Representatives.   The two episodes illustrate the nature of Philippine society,where a Westernized, democratic veneer covers an often violent landof ``Dodge City'' social norms.   They also underscore the challenge facing President CorazonAquino in trying to build a modern, progressive nation in a landstill locked into corrupt and violent ways.   The United States, which maintains six military bases in thearchipelago nation and is committed to helping build democracy inthe Philippines, has a substantial stake in her success.   President Reagan this month proposed doubling aid to thePhilippines to $649.4 million at a time when assistance to othernations is being held in check or reduced.   Continued weaknesses and shortcomings in the 165,000-member armedforces were highlighted by the three-day takeover of the regionalheadquarters of the Philippine Constabulary in Zamboanga City, 560miles south of Manila.   On Jan. 5, about 15 Moslem policemen and their supporters, angryover plans to charge them in a 1984 killing, managed to seizecontrol of the garrison and killed the commander and his chief ofstaff.   The renegades then held out for two days against a furiousmilitary assault by nearly 1,000 troops after the government refusedfurther negotiations.   By the time the garrison was secured, 21 people, all but two ofthem renegades, were dead. But the renegades' leader, Rizal Alih,escaped to the humiliation of Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa,who ordered the assault.   Meanwhile, the regional headquarters was destroyed, becoming thesecond major garrison destroyed in 18 months of military operationsagainst dissident soldiers or police.   The general staff headquarters in Manila was gutted during theAugust 1987 coup attempt by former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan. Nomajor headquarters has been destroyed in clashes with Communist orMoslem rebels since Mrs. Aquino took office in 1986.   Most Manila television stations, which rarely report eventsoutside the capital, dispatched crews to Zamboanga. Dramatic footageof soldiers battling police shocked residents of the capital, manyof whom are largely insulated from violence in the countryide.   ``The inconclusive result is now viewed by a shocked nation asusing a sledgehammer to swat a fly,'' wrote columnist Jesus Bigorniain The Manila Bulletin.   In the aftermath of the Zamboanga incident, de Villa has orderedcommanders to weed out ``scalawags'' from the police and militaryranks. Yet many Filipinos are skeptical this crackdown onlawlessness in the ranks will be any more effective than those thatcame before.   Last year, Cicero Campos, chairman of the National PoliceCommision, said his agency received an average of 1,500 complaints ayear of criminal activity by some of the country's 52,000 policemen.He admitted the figure was the ``tip of the iceberg,'' and few ofthe complaints result in prosecution or dismissal.   ``What do the authorities do about these criminal elementsdressed in law enforcement uniforms,'' wrote columnist NinezCacho-Olivares in the newspaper BusinessWorld. ``Do they wait untilthese criminal elements storm a building or an army camp beforemoving in on them?''   Less dramatic _ but equally ominous _ were reports in Manilanewspapers that the House of Representatives was importing up to 600Uzi submachine guns and Galil rifles to provide ``security'' for itssome 200 members.   Rep. Renato Unico, a member of the House defense committee,confirmed the reports and said the Israeli-made weapons had beenordered after the chamber's security force ran away during theAugust 1987 coup attempt.   Unico, dubbed ``Uzico'' by radio commentators, said congressmenneeded the weapons for protection during visits to remote districts,where Communist and Moslem insurgents operate.   But the idea of congressional security guards wieldinghigh-powered firearms, paid for by tax money, raised the specter ofa return to the ``private armies,'' which Filipino politicianstraditionally used to intimidate opponents and guarantee theirre-election.   Mrs. Aquino had promised to disband such ``private armies,''which were believed to number nearly 300 when she came to power.   ``Let's face it, political bouts are settled as much by blood andbullets as by ballots,'' wrote the Philippine Daily Inquirer in aneditorial.   The newspaper Malaya said the report ominously suggests thatdespite promises of a new era in Philippine politics, ``thepolitical warlordism of Philippine politics, with all its negativeconnotations, is here to stay.''</TEXT></DOC>
