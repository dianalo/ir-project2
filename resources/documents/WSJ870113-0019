Economic growth is expected to pick up and the nation's unemployment rate to remain one of Europe's lowest. But the government's upbeat account of economic prospects failed to calm jittery capital markets. Interest rates edged higher in bond trading, while stock prices plunged in what brokers said was the sharpest drop in more than a year.    &quot;The market expected something would be done to curb expansion of private consumption. When that didn't happen, investors thought money markets would have to carry the entire burden, and interest rates would keep rising,&quot; a stock trader at the Enskilda Fondkommission unit of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken said.    The draft budget for fiscal 1988, which starts July 1, is equivalent to $51.23 billion and represents a 1.7% increase in state outlays from fiscal 1987. Rising revenue, together with a $444 million package of cuts in some areas of spending, would trim the deficit to $5.47 billion, or 3.6% of gross national product, from $6 billion, or 4.1% of GNP in the current fiscal year.    Finance Minister Kjell Olof Feldt predicted that higher industrial investment and a rapid increase in inventories, together with continued robust private consumption, would boost economic growth to 2.2% this year from the year-earlier 1.7%.    &quot;Fiscal policy is neutral, economic growth this year will come primarily from the private sector instead of from the budget,&quot; he said. The finance minister acknowledged, however, that fighting a resurgence of inflation -- to an expected 4% rate from the year-earlier 3.2% -- &quot;remains the main focus of economic policy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
