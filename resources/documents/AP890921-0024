Gen. Colin L. Powell, whose career has spanned two combat toursin Vietnam to a stint as former President Reagan's national securityadviser, won unanimous approval Wednesday from the Senate ArmedServices Committee to be the nation's top military commander.   If confirmed by the full Senate, Powell would succeed Adm.William J. Crowe Jr., who is retiring Sept. 30.   During the nearly three-hour confirmation hearing earlierWednesday, Powell told members of the committee that politicalchanges in the Soviet Union should not lead to wholesale cuts in theStar Wars program, land-based nuclear missiles or the B-2 stealthbomber.   House legislation would cut $502 million from the $1.1 billionrequest for the multiple-warhead, rail-based MX missile andeliminate all $100 million earmarked for the single-warhead,truck-mobile Midgetman.   Powell said the House plan ``would completely unhinge our START(Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) negotiating position.''   House and Senate conferees met behind closed doors Wednesday tocraft a final version of the defense bill. According tocongressional sources who requested anonymity, senators rejected arevised House proposal calling for full funding of the MX missileand elimination of the Midgetman.   Powell's remarks came one day after Secretary of State James A.Baker III announced the administration will no longer insist onelimination of land-based mobile missiles, conceding the issue hadcomplicated negotiations. The Soviets have two mobile missiles whilethe administration is asking Congress to fund the MX and Midgetman.   Powell also told senators that scaling back the program to build130 of the bat-winged B-2 bombers, considered the most expensiveplane in history at $530 million a copy, would force the UnitedStates to change its stance in arms talks with the Soviets.   ``Without the B-2, we no longer have the same START position thatwe did for the last several years and I believe it most unlikelythat there will be a treaty up here to ratify,'' he said.   ``We would have to go back quite a ways and renegotiate adifferent type of treaty,'' he said.   On other issues, Powell said:   _He supported using the armed forces in the war on drugs and inresponse to terrorist attacks.   _The U.S. should not unilaterally cut troops in South Korea,Europe and other overseas posts to convince allies to share more ofthe defense burden. Powell said he was ``very hesitant'' to do it tosatisfy current budget demands.   Powell is commander of the Army Forces Command in FortMacPherson, Ga. He was hailed by Democrat Albert Gore Jr. ofTennessee and Republican Pete Wilson of California as likely thebest appointment Bush has made.</TEXT></DOC>
