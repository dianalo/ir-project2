Under the process developed at the Reproductive GeneticsInstitute of Illinois Masonic Medical Center, doctors remove eggsfrom the woman's body as they would in any test-tube pregnancy.   The eggs are inspected for mutations. Then, healthy eggs arefertilized in a petri dish with sperm and returned to the woman'swomb.   The technique was discovered by embryologist Yury Verlinsky,director of the cell genetics laboratory, who said he was able tospot mutations in human ova ready for in vitro fertilization.   ``In the future,'' Verlinsky said, ``it could become routine forthose disorders for which there is a well-defined gene because itdecreases risk to an embryo.''   A report on the technique was to be presented today at theannual meeting of the American Society of Human Genetics inBaltimore.   ``This procedure is for couples who already know they'recarriers of genetic diseases but won't consider an abortion,'' saidDr. Charles Strom, chief of medical genetics at the center. ``Thesepeople already may have lost a child, or have an aversion toabortion or the psychological trauma that can go along with it.''   Current genetic tests are conducted after pregnancy and holdsome risk to the developing fetus.</TEXT></DOC>
