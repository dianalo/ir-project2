Four original DNA conformations are considered: 1) linear chain;2) relaxed circle; 3) supercoiled circle; 4) supercoiled linear. Themodel includes the systems of differential equations for calculatingthe size distributions of DNA molecules as functions of dose. The distributionsare used in the usual hydrodynamic formulae for heterogeneous populationsof polymer molecules. The model shows how one can estimate the radiationyield of double-strand breaks (D/sub 37//sup dsb/) from experimentaldata. The sensitivity of viscoelastiometry for the estimation of D/sub37//sup dsb/ is better than that of viscometry. The model predicts aconsiderable difference between the radiation response of linear andcircular DNAs. This prediction is confirmed by experimental data forT4 DNA and E. coli DNA. Thus, ionizing radiation can be used to determinethe original conformation of DNA molecules.</TEXT></DOC>
