If approved by AmBase's board, the plan would jeopardizethe sale of Home Insurance Co., AmBase's principal business.</LP><TEXT>   Vik Brothers International, a European-based investorgroup, agreed on Aug. 14 to purchase the troubled propertyand casualty insurance unit for $544 million. Vik officialscouldn't be reached for comment.   The latest offer includes refinancing of $410 million inAmBase bank debt and a cash infusion of as much as $68million. The Vik agreement called for assumption of $76million in debt.   The new investor group indicated that if it gains controlof AmBase it would keep the insurance unit. &quot;We believe thatthe Home Insurance Co. is well positioned to become a premierunderwriter,&quot; a spokesman for the investor group said.AmBase's directors are expected to vote on the offer today.   William Walsh, one of the investors, said management,including Chairman George Scharffenberger, wouldn't stay onbut that executives running Home Insurance and other unitswould be retained.   The investor group includes Sequoia Associates, MenloPark, Calif.; Hermitage Capital Corp., a subsidiary ofFinancial Securities Fund L.P., New York; and WhitmanHeffernon Rhein andamp; Co., New York. Some notable names in theinsurance industry are part of the group including DonaldMacNaughton, former chairman of Prudential Insurance Co. ofAmerica, and Benjamin N. Woodson, former chairman of AmericanGeneral Corp.   AmBase rose 25 cents a share yesterday to $2 in New YorkStock Exchange composite trading. It was one of the fewgaining stocks on the Big Board.   &quot;This is a pretty positive offer,&quot; said Gloria L. Vogel,insurance analyst with Bear Stearns Co. &quot;Shareholders areleft with more than under the Vik agreement.&quot; Under thatagreement, shareholders essentially would have been left withonly the Carteret Bancorp Inc. unit, and still holding mostof the $730 million in total AmBase debt. Included in Vik'spurchase would be Gruntal Financial Corp. and Sterling ForestCorp., among other Home Insurance units.   Under the latest proposal, the investor group isconsidering refinancing AmBase's existing bank debt of $410million through a new financing facility to be led by WestpacBanking Corp.   Once the controlling stake is purchased, the investorswould seek to raise a further $68 million through a rightsoffering to shareholders. The rights include zero-couponnotes, which would carry attached warrants to purchase 34million AmBase shares at $2 each. If shareholders don'taccept the rights-offer, however, the investors said they areprepared to make a cash infusion of up to $68 million.   Spokesmen for the investor group declined to say if theywould use a tender offer to seek the controlling stake, or toelaborate on the terms of the rights offering. AmBasecurrently has about 34 million shares outstanding.   Udayan Ghose, insurance analyst with Shearson LehmanBrothers, said the investor group is in a strong position.&quot;You're looking at controlling an awful lot of equity withoutputting up very much money. The key here was that they wereable to get financing from Westpac.&quot;   Indeed, analysts were skeptical that AmBase officialscould raise enough cash from the Home Insurance sale and aplanned preferred stock offering to pay off its corporatedebt.   In addition, the Vik agreement angered shareholders whofiled suit in Manhattan federal court last week chargingAmBase with disseminating false information to inflate itsstock price. Before the announcement of the Vik agreementlast week, AmBase shares were trading at $7 or $8 apiece.   After AmBase put Home Insurance on the block in February,it suspended payment of its quarterly common stock dividend,but said that it expected to pay a special dividend toshareholders when it closed on the sale. Shortly afterreaching the accord with Vik, AmBase officials admitted thecompany would not be able to distribute the special dividend.The shareholder lawsuit claims AmBase should have disclosedearlier that it would not be able to pay the specialdividend.   Mr. Scharffenberger has a hefty severance package, whichwould pay him five years of salary, plus a five-yearconsulting contract. In 1989, he earned more than $1.54million, in addition to stock options and other bonuses.   ---   Beatrice E. Garcia contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
