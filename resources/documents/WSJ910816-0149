But Jack Twyman, chief executive officer, who declined tomake a specific forecast, asserted that the company hasbecome more aggressive in efforts to expand sales as a way tocounter a profit decline arising from sluggish consumerspending.</LP><TEXT>   The wholesaler of groceries and other products sold bysupermarkets and convenience stores earned $17.2 million, or$1.60 a share, in fiscal 1990.   Despite data tentatively indicating that an economicrecovery has begun, Super Foods &quot;hasn't seen any resurgenceyet,&quot; he said. Sales are running 2% to 3% behindexpectations, he said. Since last fall, customers have spenta dollar or two less than usual on each visit to the grocerystore, Mr. Twyman said. They're buying cheaper products andpassing up &quot;impulse&quot; items, which range from health andbeauty aids to dog collars.   Mr. Twyman said the acquisition this month of KentuckyFood Stores Inc., a retailer-owned cooperative based inLexington, Ky., illustrates one type of expansion Super Foodsintends to pursue. He said he is discussing the possibleacquisition of other grocery wholesalers with annual sales of$100 million to $150 million, but he said it is too early tosay whether those discussions will be successful.   Also, Super Foods will be more aggressive in seeking towin customers away from other wholesalers, he said. And thecompany is trying to obtain business from store chains thatcurrently do their own distribution. Super Foods could takeover the entire warehousing and distribution function, orjust supplement the retailers' own distribution operations.   In a reversal of policy, Super Foods also would consideracquiring wholesalers that distribute products other thangrocery-store items, Mr. Twyman said. He cited drugwholesaling as one possible area, but he said the companyisn't negotiating with any wholesalers outside the groceryarea.   Super Foods sales in fiscal 1990 rose 5% to $1.78 billion.For the first 36 weeks of fiscal 1991, however, sales roseonly 1.9%, and net income dropped to 72 cents a share from $1a share a year earlier.   Because sales gains remain weak, &quot;it will be difficult toequal&quot; the fiscal 1990 fourth-quarter profit from normaloperations, Mr. Twyman said. However, he said the companywill have a positive year-end accounting adjustment this yearthat could add more than 10 cents a share, in contrast to acharge a year earlier. In the year-earlier quarter, SuperFoods earned 60 cents a share.   Companies such as Super Foods that use last-in-first-out,or LIFO, accounting for inventories make a provision eachquarter to offset the expected rise in prices. &quot;This year,for the first time in the 20 years I've been in the business,we're likely to have zero inflation&quot; in the merchandisecovered by LIFO accounting, he said. The company had beenexpecting an average price rise of about 2.5%, roughly thesame as for fiscal 1990.   Despite that year-end adjustment, price stability is adrag on earnings for the fiscal year, he said. Super Foodsprovides most products to retailers at cost but receives feesbased on dollar volume. In previous years, inflation hascontributed to the sales rise.   Super Foods directors will consider a dividend increase attheir October meeting, Mr. Twyman said, but it's too early topredict whether they will vote an increase in light of theexpected earnings decline. Super Foods has increased thedividend for 10 consecutive years, a string that he said theboard would be reluctant to break.   Last October, directors raised the dividend to 8.5 cents ashare quarterly, effective with the December payment. &quot;Wethink this year is an aberration&quot; and that profit will resumeits growth, he said. The board will consider final resultsfor fiscal 1991 and profit prospects for next year inreaching its decision, Mr. Twyman said.   Super Foods has its costs under control, Mr. Twyman said.While the company will continue to try to minimize the risein costs, profit increases will have to come mainly fromhigher sales, he said. &quot;There's only so much you can take outof costs,&quot; he said. &quot;For 1992, our priority has to beincreasing the top line.&quot;   Super Foods improved its internal operations in the 1980s,Mr. Twyman said, and &quot;In the 1990s we will spread our wings alittle bit&quot; and look for external growth.</TEXT></DOC>
