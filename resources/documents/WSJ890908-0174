Pursuing a tip, police seized the pair and the drugs, with a street value in Munich of about $300,000. But follow-up detective work and leads from the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration indicated this was a small advance sample. The big shipment would come six weeks later by sea from Colombia's Medellin cocaine cartel.    Detectives had the dock staked out when the Don Juan V, a rusting Panamanian freighter, pulled into the port of Bremerhaven Aug. 21, loaded with 400 tons of quartz sand and 1,430 pounds of cocaine. Police watched as the crew loaded 28 large sacks into a Volkswagen van. Then they tailed it south for seven hours to Munich, hoping to nail the rest of the gang. But the Panamanian driver spotted his followers and began trying to shake them, and police swooped in and arrested him.    They succeeded in seizing uncut cocaine with a wholesale value of 200 million marks ($100.6 million). It was the second-largest seizure of cocaine on record in Europe, ranking behind a 2,200-pound shipment intercepted last year in Spain.    The arrests suggest drug shipments to Europe from the West are increasing. The continent is ill-prepared, with a leaky assortment of seaports and airports, fragmented law-enforcement and the dismantling of what internal barriers there are already under way.    European police departments have increased the size of narcotics staffs. More vice officers are being attached to embassies in Latin America. Some are joining the U.S. in aiding the Colombian government.    But they are up against formidable odds. According to Interpol, the international police organization based in Lyon, France, cocaine seizures in Western Europe last year jumped 87% from the year before to 15,150 pounds. For the first time, the amount of intercepted cocaine exceeded heroin seizures in Europe.    But police and customs agents estimate that total shipments are at least 10 times the amounts intercepted.    Deaths from drugs of all types hit a record 2,535 last year in Western Europe. That is nearly double the 1986 total, and authorities say the sharp jump probably reflects increased cocaine use. Meanwhile, East bloc nations, including Poland, Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union, are seeking Western help in battling their own growing drug problems.    Until recently, the multibillion-dollar cocaine industry has used Europe, with its under-regulated banking systems, primarily as a place to launder U.S. drug profits. Now, while as much as 90% of the cocaine output still goes to North America, perhaps 10% or more may be aimed here.    &quot;The primary reason is that the U.S. market is pretty well flooded,&quot; says Cornelius Dougherty, a DEA spokesman. Street prices in the U.S. are at rock bottom, while South American output of cocaine hydrochloride, the coca leaf's finished product, is higher than ever, roughly estimated at about 400 metric tons for 1988.    Until now, cocaine use in Europe has been mostly associated with small circles in show business and the international jet set. But a rising number of white-collar urban professionals with faster lifestyles and more disposable income may tend to broaden the market, as it did in the U.S.    Cocaine prices in Europe are at least double and often triple New York wholesale prices of about $8,000 a pound. Generally, retail prices in Europe are lowest where supply is greatest, near the main entry points: the Madrid and Frankfurt airports and seaports in the Netherlands, West Germany and Spain. As dealers take on costs and risks of transportation to places with tighter supply, retail prices multiply. Thus, depending on purity, a gram of cocaine selling for about $50 in Portugal and the Netherlands may cost $170 in Switzerland or $200 in Austria.    So far, authorities have found little trace in Europe of cocaine's much cheaper street derivative, crack.    European officials are cheering efforts by the U.S. and Colombian governments to crush the cocaine cartels of Colombia but are skeptical that it will interrupt the flow for long. They fear that if stamped out in Colombia the cocaine organizations would simply resurface in a neighboring country with new kingpins.    The European Community's plan to dismantle internal barriers after 1992 could make drug trafficking even easier, police fear. If border checks are eliminated entirely -- which some leaders oppose for law-enforcement reasons -- then conceivably cocaine shipments could be driven all the way from Portugal to Denmark without the risk of customs checks at any of four national frontiers.    In addition, millions of passengers and staggering volumes of freight flow through Europe's big airports every year. Shipping poses similar problems. The port of Rotterdam alone handles 6,000 containers a day. Every week thousands of private yachts cross the Atlantic Ocean to arrive at isolated coastal marinas.    Spain has emerged as a leading beachhead. It offers the drug suppliers the convenience of a common language and a large community of Latin Americans, and it has ample coastline and extensive air links with South and Central America. Last year, Spanish authorities seized 7,614 pounds of cocaine, far more than interceptions by any other European country. Just last week, 4,000 policemen conducted raids in 40 Spanish towns, seizing drugs and arresting 400 persons.    In hopes of tightening control over inbound shipments, European countries are expected to transfer customs agents from internal to external EC borders after 1992. But law enforcement officials argue that ultimately, Europe will have to create a pan-European drug-enforcement agency similar to the DEA of the U.S., even though that idea is certain to face tough political hurdles. </TEXT></DOC>
