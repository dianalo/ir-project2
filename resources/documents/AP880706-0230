Israel's military government ordered all Palestinian-rungovernment hospitals in the West Bank to stop treating casualtiesof the Arab uprising free of charge, Arab doctors said.   There were no reports of injuries in the firebomb attack on KingGeorge Street, the center of west Jerusalem's shopping district.Police rushed to the scene to search for suspects and stopped Arabpassers-by for identity checks.   Palestinians have stepped up firebombs attacks on Israelitargets in recent weeks, but rarely have they acted in busy Jewishpopulation centers such as west Jerusalem.   In other developmentes Wednesday:   _Police arrested a dozen Palestinians in Arab east Jerusalemafter youths stoned riot police and buses.   _The military administration extended for three days a closureorder against all 800 Arab schools in the West Bank, an Israelispokesman said. The army says the schools, which are to reopenMonday, are centers of unrest in the nearly 7-month-old Palestinianuprising.   _The government said it would check a complaint of the ABC-TVnetwork that Israeli secret service agents posed as ABC employeesto deceive a 17-year-old Palestinian, whom they arrested.   In the West Bank city of Nablus, Palestinian youths stoned anarmy patrol and troops opened fire, wounding 9-year-old AhmedSarkaji in the left leg, said officials at the city's Al-IttihadHospital.   An army spokesman said two Nablus residents were hurt, includingone by a rubber bullet. He said he had no further details.   Police closed two schools in east Jerusalem after Arab studentsburned tires and hurled rocks at riot police, said police spokesmanAlex Lapidot. One officer was slightly injured by a stone, andpolice detained one youth, Lapidot said.   Eleven other Arabs were arrested after buses were stoned,Lapidot said. In one stoning attack, three Arabs fled into eastJerusalem's central bus station, and police fired tear gas into thecrowded terminal before capturing the suspects.   Arab hospital officials said the new order regarding patientpayments was given to the directors of government-run West Bankhospitals at a meeting Tuesday at the military governmentheadquarters in Bet El.   A senior military spokesman said the order was not new, but arestatement of existing policy. It applies to all patients who donot have health insurance from the military government, not onlythose wounded in the uprising, the official said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   The Israeli daily Al Hamishmar and the Arab daily Ashaabnewspapers said the hospitals were ordered to charge $175 per nightto every patient _ including wounded Palestinians _ and to demand athree-night advance payment.   The hospitals are funded by taxes collected from Palestinians inthe West Bank.   In addition, a Palestinian patient must sign a contract allowingthe hospital to use his property as collateral against the finalpayment, the newspapers said.   The government forbids the hospitals to transfer casualties toIsraeli hospitals, as was done before in emergency cases.   Thousands of Arabs have been wounded by Israeli gunfire in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza strip since the rebellion beganDec. 8. Four Israelis and 215 Palestinians have died.   About 9 percent of the wounded were admitted to West Bankgovernment hospitals and most of those have been unable to paytheir bills, said Dr. Abdel Rahman Shunar, director of the Rafidiyehospital in Nablus.   He said the hospital had 16 wounded Palestinians when theyreceived the order Tuesday, and four were sent home while 12 weretransferred to private hospitals.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's aide Avi Pazner said thegovernment would check allegations that two carloads of Israelicivilians impersonated an ABC News crew June 24 to arrest NizarDakdouk, 17, of the West Bank village of Salfit.   ABC correspondent Dean Reynolds said the network learned of theincident and complained to the Israeli police, the army andShamir's office before making the complaints public in a broadcastTuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
