Ali Saibou, military ruler ofNiger, has granted what amounts to a pardon for people whoattempted two coups against his predecessor.   The pardon took the form of a general amnesty for thoseconvicted of crimes against state security, according to broadcastsWednesday by the West African country's official radio.   Such an amnesty would free officers and civilians involved inattempted the coups against Maj. Gen. Seyni Kountche, who died in aParis hospital Nov. 10 of what was believed to be a brain tumor.The radio said the amnesty bars those released from holdinggovernment jobs except after official review.   Excluded from the pardon was Amadou Oumarou, a wealthybusinessman and former close adviser of Kountche, who failed in athird coup attempt Oct. 6, 1983. He was said to be living inBelgium.   Most of the plotters and other political prisoners are held inthe arid northeastern part of the country or exiled to theirvillages, and some fled the country. The radio did not say how manypeople were involved.   In January, Saibou granted a partial amnesty to militarypersonnel convicted of lesser crimes, except for those who violated``morality and honor,'' an apparent reference to convicted coupplotters. The January decision also commuted to life imprisonmentall death sentences announced before 1988.   Hamani Diori, Niger's first president after independence fromFrance in 1960, was given his freedom from house arrest early in1987. Kountche overthrew Diori, now in his 80s, in 1974.   Niger, part of the drought-stricken Sahel region, is one of theworld's poorest countries with a population of 6 million and a percapita annual income of about $250. The government said in Januaryit needed 274,000 tons of grain to avoid food shortages for 1.4million people.</TEXT></DOC>
