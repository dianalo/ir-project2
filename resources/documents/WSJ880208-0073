While no one yet claims to know the cause of the surge, a hypothesis suggested by Jay M. Gould, a fellow of the Institute for Policy Studies in Washington, is getting wide attention. He thinks the April 1986 accident at the nuclear reactor at Chernobyl, in the Ukraine, could have hastened the deaths of many Americans.    The U.S. government, whose mortality figures show the leap in deaths, has offered no official explanation for it. But Sharon Ramirez, a public-affairs specialist at the government's National Center for Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., stressed that the data that Mr. Gould used are still provisional.    Final mortality figures for 1986 are being assembled for release this summer. While noting that the overall 1986 mortality figure was the largest ever recorded in the U.S., she said the increase was felt to be consistent with the growth in the population over 65 years of age.    But, said Marvin Lavenhar, director of the division of biostatistics and epidemiology at New Jersey Medical School in Newark, &quot;You can't escape the fact that something happened in the summer of 1986.&quot; Statistics can't prove whether or not it was caused by Chernobyl, he said. But he added, &quot;We are trying to look for other factors, and so far we can't find any explanation.&quot;    Last year, as preliminary U.S. vital statistics for 1986 became available state by state, Mr. Gould began a computer analysis to detect any significant fluctuations in birth and death rates. His survey of the monthly vital statistics reports of the national health-statistics center turned up a startling anomaly: In the May-through-August period immediately following the disaster, between 20,000 and 40,000 more Americans than usual died.    The discovery -- and his effort to link it to Chernobyl -- have touched off a scientific debate heated by the strong passions that swirl around the question of nuclear safety. While Mr. Gould's work has received considerable attention in Europe, it was largely ignored in the U.S. until the British weekly, the Economist, reported it in its U.S. edition of Jan. 30.    By Mr. Gould's calculation, the probability that so many extra deaths could have occurred by chance is less than one in a million. This is because the seasonal pattern of deaths in the U.S. has been remarkably stable. In the 80 years prior to 1986, the summer months have, on average, contributed 31.7% of the total year's deaths. But in the summer of 1986, the percentage jumped to more than 33% -- the highest summertime proportion since 1900, and well above the 31.97% summer average for the three preceding years. In summer, mortality is generally at the lowest level.    The radioactive cloud emanating from the Soviet reactor arrived in the U.S. in early May 1986. The fallout varied widely, depending on the cloud's path and the levels of rainfall in different regions. Nowhere did the low levels of radiation exceed levels deemed tolerable by the government.    When Mr. Gould looked at mortality data by geographic region, he turned up a correlation between deaths and radioactive fallout. Using the nation's nine census regions, he compared summer death rates with levels of radioactive iodine-131 in milk measured at Environmental Protection Agency monitoring stations.    In states like Arizona and Texas, where iodine-131 levels were the lowest, the summer mortality rates were about normal. But California and Washington, where concentrations of iodine-131 were the highest, recorded the sharpest increases in mortality: about 5% above the previous summer. The pattern held true across the country. The higher a state's fallout, the larger the increase in the death rate. Mr. Gould says the probability of getting so high a correlation purely by chance is less than one in 1,000. Infant mortality rates also fluctuated geographically according to radioactivity levels.    The government statistical center compiles but does not analyze vital statistics provided by the states. Its provisional mortality reports -- and most of Mr. Gould's calculations -- are based on a 10% sample of all U.S. death and birth certificates. This sample shows an increase of about 40,000 deaths in the summer of 1986. Preliminary reports of total deaths from the states, which are also subject to revision, yield about a 20,000 increase.    Linking the increase in deaths to Chernobyl has raised many questions, among them these: How could harmful effects be felt in the U.S. and not in Europe, where radiation levels were 100 to 1000 times higher? And how could deaths occur so quickly, when radiation is normally associated with genetic mutations and cancers that take years to develop?    One hypothesis is advanced by Ernest J. Sternglass, emeritus professor of radiological physics at the University of Pittsburgh, who has figured prominently in past controversies over the effects of fallout on health. He asserts that low-dosage, ingested radiation is more pernicious than short, external bursts of high-level radiation, such as those received in medical X-rays.    Ingested isotopes concentrate in vital organs like the thyroid and bone marrow and irradiate tissue over long periods. These fission products also produce &quot;free radicals,&quot; unstable molecules that gravitate to cell membranes, destroying the cell. If bone marrow or white blood cells are damaged, the body's immune system can be impaired.    Laboratory studies, Mr. Sternglass says, have shown that free radicals become more efficient cell destroyers at low radiation concentrations; at high concentrations, they collide and &quot;deactivate&quot; one another. He suggests that Chernobyl radiation may have hastened the deaths of people -- like the elderly and infirm -- with already weakened immune systems.    This theory hasn't been widely examined, and it is disputed. &quot;I don't buy the free-radical thesis,&quot; said John W. Gofman, professor emeritus of medical physics at the University of California at Berkeley, who spent six months investigating the consequences of Chernobyl. If valid, he argues, &quot;we would be seeing a hell of a lot of problems in Europe -- fertility should have vanished.&quot; Even allowing for the tendency of governments to &quot;falsely downplay&quot; Chernobyl's ultimate toll, he said, &quot;I cannot believe that the people in Europe could be hiding such consequences.&quot;    Donald Louria, chairman of the New Jersey Medical School's department of preventive medicine and community health, hopes to obtain more data on the precise causes of the excess deaths to determine whether blaming radioactivity &quot;makes biological sense.&quot; But he adds, &quot;You cannot look at this blip on the data base and say, 'So what?'&quot; After being initially negative, he said, &quot;I've been persuaded that there is enough there to merit a good look. It would be unwise to treat Gould's findings dismissively, and equally unwise to overinterpret them.&quot;    Neal Nelson, a radiation biologist with the EPA who has read the Economist's account of Mr. Gould's study, said he would like to see a more detailed analysis of the data. The incremental radiation doses from Chernobyl in the U.S., he says, were only a tiny fraction of ordinary background radiation levels. To say that such an increase &quot;could trigger a change in immune susceptibility does not seem reasonable.&quot; But he said the work &quot;is of interest, and it should be evaluated on its merits.&quot;    Mr. Gould will present his report later this month at an international conference on radiation in West Germany. The statistician, who served on the EPA's science advisory board during the Carter administration, said that he has rarely encountered, in 35 years of research, such statistically significant correlations in data -- what statisticians call &quot;low P-values.&quot; But he said his excitement was tempered by &quot;dread at what the results might mean.&quot; As for Chernobyl radioactivity, he said, &quot;We regard this as merely a hypothesis, and hope someone can explain it short of Chernobyl.&quot;    ---                     American Mortality   1986 cause of deaths, percentage change from a year ago                              Jan.-     May-      Sept.-                              Apr.
