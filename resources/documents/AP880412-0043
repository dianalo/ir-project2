The letter, released Monday, reasserted church teachings thatbirth control by artificial means is wrong. But it also said, ``Itis essential that we foster a dialogue between those who findprohibitions against artificial contraception unacceptable andthose who find that the natural regulation of births has enrichedand preserved their marriage.''   The 164-page letter breaks little new ground on women's role inthe church but does condemn sexism and urges priests to be moresensitive to women's concerns.   The document recommended that women play more of a leadershiprole in the church and suggests further study of the possibility ofinstalling women as permanent deacons.   It also said girls should be allowed to join altar boys inassisting priests, saying that exclusion of girls seems ``to standin contradiction to our call for women's more direct involvement inthe life of the church.''   However, the bishops stopped short of recommending that women beordained as priests.   On birth control, the draft acknowledged that ``there is a widegap between what the church teaches about artificial contraceptionand the actual practice of many Catholic women.''   ``Consulting with women on matters pertaining to birth controlwill contribute to church teaching on sexuality,'' the draft said.``Women's experience will lead to the formulation of betterpolicies and preparation for family planning that can be morewidely communicated to engaged and married couples.   ``We especially encourage a spirit of compassion towards thosewho in good conscience who have not lived in accord with the idealsset forth by the church.''   The draft of the pastoral letter, titled ``Partners in theMystery of Redemption, A Pastoral Response to Women's Concerns forChurch and Society,'' will be circulated among Catholics in theUnited States, with responses due Dec. 1.   A final draft is expected to be presented to the full body ofU.S. bishops in November 1989 and, if approved, would become partof Catholic teachings. The draft was issued more than five yearsafter church authorities began a study of women in the church.   Mary Brabeck, associate professor of educational psychology atBoston College, who helped prepare the draft letter, said shethought the significance of the document was that ``women are beinglistened to, their experiences are being listened to.''   Sister Sara Butler of the Missionary Servants of the MostBlessed Trinity in Philadelphia, said that the letter was``definitely trying to address male attitudes, and particularlymale clerical attitudes.''   The pastoral letter, in fact, chastises some priests andcounselors in the church who fail to show understanding fordivorced women.   ``Some of us as well as priests, religious and laity need toovercome the fear or prejudice that causes them to shun those whosemarriages have led to divorce or ended in annulment,'' the lettersaid.   At another point, the letter said: ``A frequently voiced concernis that those to whom women turn for help do not have the training,sensitivity or experience necessary to address concretely what itis like to be a mother, pursue a career, seek just wages and bevigilant in regard to sexual violence.''</TEXT></DOC>
