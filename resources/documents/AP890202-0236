(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Three men and two boys were arrestedThursday after four armed robberies of Amish residents near thisrural town over the past two weeks, authorities said.   ``I feel that we've got all the people involved in the Amishrobberies,'' said Lawrence County Sheriff Tom Pyrdum.   Six Amish residents in the county about 60 miles south ofNashville were robbed in a string of holdups that began Jan. 22 whena gunman took $85 from two men in a milk barn.   On Jan. 28, an armed man leaped into two Amish buggies travelingdown a dark country road. About $140 was taken in those holdups.   On Jan. 30, an Amish harnessmaker was held up at his shop by twomen in a pickup truck who made off with about $300.   Michael McConnell, no age available, Rodney J.D. Smith, 18, andJames E. Smith Jr., 22, each were charged with one count of armedrobbery, and additional charges were expected, Pyrdum said.   The sheriff identified McConnell as the uncle of the Smiths, whohe said are brothers. Each was being held on $250,000 bond pending ahearing Friday, he said.   The two other suspects, ages 16 and 17, were being held byjuvenile authorities, said Pyrdum. All five suspects are fromLawrenceburg.   Pyrum said the arrests came after investigators matched a partiallicense plate number with a description of the pickup used in thelast holdup. He also said that two of the adults had confessed tothe robberies.   The sheriff said he expected the full cooperation of the Amishvictims in prosecuting the suspects.   ``They're very interested in getting these people caught,'' saidPyrdum. ``Although the Amish are not known as prosecutors, they willtestify.''   The Amish, a conservative sect of the Mennonite Church, are notedfor their simple lifestyle, which includes wearing plain, darkclothing. They do not use electricity or motorized vehicles andrefuse to bear arms for self-defense or to take oaths.   The Lawrence County Amish, who number fewer than 500, came tosouthern Tennessee from Pennsylvania in 1944. Most of them farm,although some also produce leather goods and furniture or docarpentry and blacksmith work.</TEXT></DOC>
