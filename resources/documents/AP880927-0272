In an interview with the Associated Press, OPEC PresidentRilwanu Lukman also said the cartel's decision to review crude oilprice and production objectives was part of a methodical processaimed at achieving unity among its members and shoring up prices.   ``Now the time has come to sit down and say, okay, this is whatwe want; this is how we're going to do it _ let's go ahead an doit,'' Lukman said in an interview at the end of a two-dayextraordinary meeting here of OPEC's five-member Price MonitoringCommittee.   The pricing committee announced Monday it had called for a jointmeeting with the five-member Long Term Strategy Committee.   Lukman said the move would bring together key members ofOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to ``see if we cancome up with something we can sell to the organization as a whole.''   The pricing committee issued a communique that said: ``it isessential that OPEC review its objectives and strategies in thecontext of current circumstances for the short, medium and the longterms especially concerning the price of oil and the productionmechanism to support it in the light of the expressed positions ofmember countries.''   OPEC has attempted to maintain a world crude oil price of $18 abarrel by restricting the output of its members.   But internal dissension that worsened during the eight-year warbetween Iran and Iraq _ two founding members of OPEC _ has led tooverproduction and a world oil glut that has depressed crude pricesto their lowest levels in two years.   The Paris-based International Energy Energy Agency reported OPECproduction at 19 million barrels a day in August and Lukman has putOPEC production at closer to 20 million barrels per day.   Last June, OPEC set a 15.06 million barrel a day ceiling toapply to all OPEC nations except Iraq, which contended it neededthe to produce more oil to help rebuild its war-torn economy.   On Monday, North Sea Brent crude for delivery in October wasquoted at $13.25, up slightly from Friday.   The signing of an Iran-Iraq ceasefire in August apparentlyopened a door of opportunity for the start of a slow, but deepreview of OPEC's strategies and targets regarding pricing andproduction policies.   Iran and Iraq are members of the Long Term Strategy Committee.Others include Saudia Arabia, Kuwait and Venezuela. The pricingcommittee comprises the oil ministers of Nigeria, Saudi Arabia,Algeria, Indonesia and Venezuela.   Referring to Iran and Iraq at a press conference Monday inMadrid, OPEC Secretary General Subroto of Indonesia said bothcountries indicated they would participate in the joint committeemeeting set for next month at an undisclosed location. Subroto saidit would be the first time in years that Iran and Iraq engaged indirect talks within OPEC.   OPEC officials said the decision to call a joint meeting of thepricing and long term strategy committees before any extraordinarysession of all OPEC ministers was part of a negotiating processthat was arranged at the previous price monitoring committeemeeting Aug. 3 in Lausanne, Switzerland.   After that meeting, Subroto was asked to visit various OPECcountries to discuss possibilities and ideas that could smooth overdifferences within the cartel, the officials said.   ``All these meetings are part of a decision-making process,''Lukman said.   But he emphasized the slow, steady pace toward more unity couldnot be expected to bring about startling breakthroughs. Lukman saidno OPEC officials believe the first joint committee meeting willproduce a new benchmark price or quotas.   ``I'm not trying to belittle the importance of the (joint)meeting. We could come up with something which is big,'' Lukmansaid.   ``All the major actors will be there,'' he said. ``At the end ofthe day we'll get something.''   Speaking of Iraq, Lukman said ``Nobody should be allowed to actunilaterally anymore _ whether we have a quota or we don't have aquota. We must sit down and agree on what to do.''</TEXT></DOC>
