Specialists at a three-day conference on the world's environment, sponsored by the Japanese government, said low-lying countries like Bangladesh could lose up to 20% of their land area in the next century because of rising ocean levels caused by melting polar ice. Thousands of Pacific islands could completely disappear, they said.    Scientists have predicted the Earth will warm gradually over coming decades because of the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; caused by a build-up of man-made gases in the atmosphere that prevent heat from escaping.    Dennis Tirpak, director of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's Global Climate Change Division, said temperatures are likely to increase by 1.5 to 4.5 degrees centigrade and ocean levels to rise by 0.5 to 2.0 meters if current emissions of &quot;greenhouse&quot; gases continue through the next century.    The sensitivity of rice, Asia's staple food, to high temperatures, and the widespread farming of marginal lands make the region particularly vulnerable to soaring temperatures, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
