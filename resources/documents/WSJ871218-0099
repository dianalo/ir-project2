Meritor's board took the action after holders of its 12% subordinated capital notes due 1998 rejected a proposed change in the note indenture -- including a higher interest rate -- that would have permitted continued payment of the dividend. The proposal required approval by holders of at least two-thirds of the $115 million of notes outstanding.    The financial services concern first said in October it would seek the change; at that time, Meritor reported a $379.6 million third-quarter loss, primarily because of a write-off of good will that marked the beginning of a restructuring plan. The loss prohibited any dividend payment according to terms under which the notes were issued.    Until the restructuring program is completed late next year, Meritor said its board decided it would be imprudent to offer holders an even higher interest rate than the one they rejected.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Meritor's stock closed at $4.625, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
