The chairman of the Resolution Trust Corp., WilliamSeidman, said he will tell Congress tomorrow that theindustry cleanup needs an additional $75 billion to $80billion, to be shelled out over the next fiscal year. Thatwould put the total cost of the bailout at between $155billion and $160 billion, not including interest ongovernment borrowings.</LP><TEXT>   Government officials contend that the price hasn't changedsince Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady's estimate last yearthat the bailout would cost taxpayers between $90 billion and$130 billion. Officials, including Mr. Seidman, argue thatthe new figure simply updates the value of the dollarsthrough 1993, when all the money would be spent.   &quot;There is no change in the basic number,&quot; Mr. Seidman saidyesterday, in reaction to a story reported in the New YorkTimes. &quot;It's just a conversion.&quot;   But even if the RTC's reading of the numbers is accurate,it means that Mr. Seidman now believes that the cost of thebailout will come in at the top of Mr. Brady's estimates.Treasury officials backed Mr. Seidman. &quot;If it's at the highend of the range, we agree,&quot; said spokeswoman DesireeTucker-Sorini. &quot;Secretary Brady has made it very clear.&quot;   The RTC, which was created to take over and sell insolventthrifts, already has received about $55 billion from Congressand has an additional $25 billion sitting in the Treasury,according to officials at the agency.   Barry Kolatch, the RTC's head of research and statistics,contends that when Mr. Brady made the $130 billion estimatelast year, he was talking in terms of what the bailout wouldhave cost if it had all been done in 1989. But because someof the failed institutions won't be sold or closed untilSeptember 1993, he says, the estimate must be increased toaccount for inflation and the cost of money.   Mr. Seidman also said yesterday that he expects the numberof failed thrifts handled by the agency to be about 800 bythe time the RTC bailout is completed. That would also be atthe high end of administration estimates.   Some said they wouldn't be surprised if the cost figuresincrease further. &quot;The amount of money lost will depend onhow fast they can dispose of the assets, how fast they dotheir work, the future path of the economy and the futurepath of interest rates,&quot; said William Isaac, the formerFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. chairman who now heads SecuraGroup, a consulting firm. &quot;I don't believe anybody should beshocked if that number comes in higher.&quot;   Mr. Seidman, who is also chairman of the FDIC, plans topropose restructuring the two boards that oversee the bailoutto create a single entity. One possibility would be tocombine the FDIC's board and the RTC's oversight board into asingle corporate-style nine-member board and three-memberexecutive committee.   The current structure &quot;may not be the best setup now thatwe've gotten things up and running,&quot; he said. &quot;The FDIC isheavily involved, yet it isn't in charge. I just think it's agood time to review the situation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
