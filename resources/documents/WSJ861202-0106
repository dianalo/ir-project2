Generale des Constructions Telephoniques to 20%. But despite the decision, the foreign company that wins the bidding is still likely to gain management control of the state-owned maker of telephone switches, industry sources said.    The decision will force bidders to reshape their offers, raising yet another obstacle in the long-delayed, politically sensitive denationalization of the troubled company. However, no French company appears capable or willing to take it over, leaving the 20% stake the apparent key to running the company. And with foreign concerns anxious to gain a foothold in the French telephone-switching market, they seem willing to take whatever share they can get.    French officials say they decided after a lengthy debate that CGCT could not be exempted from denationalization laws, which limit total foreign shareholdings to 20% of a company. But some diplomats and industry sources speculated yesterday that the government set the limit in the hope that at least one of the suitors would drop out, thus making the government's decision easier.    During the 18-month negotiations to sell CGCT, involving American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in partnership with N.V. Philips of the Netherlands; Siemens AG of West Germany; L.M. Ericsson Telefon AB of Sweden; and Plessey Co. of Britain, it had been unclear whether the same rules would apply if a company is denationalized by being sold directly to another company rather than floated on the market.    &quot;The government must scrupulously respect the law on privatization,&quot; one senior government official said. &quot;There will have to be new offers in which direct foreign stakes don't exceed 20%.&quot;    Most of the foreign bidders are likely to make such offers. Although the decision marks a serious setback for some, no firm is expected to withdraw from the bidding because of the strategic interest of gaining access to the long-sheltered French market. Industry sources said that foreign groups could form partnerships with such French groups as Matra S.A. and Jeumont-Schneider to bid for CGCT, with the foreign group exercising management control.    &quot;We will make a new proposal according to the new rules,&quot; said Cees Steijger, a spokesman for ATandamp;T-Philips Telecommunications B.V., the Netherlands-based joint venture that has made a bid for CGCT. &quot;It's very important for a telecommunications company to have a share of the French market.&quot; An official at Siemens, while saying the company was waiting to see the details of the French government's decision, also said Siemens was still interested in gaining entry to the French public telephoning switching market.    Added Jan Stenberg, president of Ericsson's public telecommunications division, &quot;We are convinced that (the restrictions on foreign ownership) would be agreeable to us.&quot;    The decision is the latest twist in a complex multinational lobbying saga that has developed into one of the most politically sensitive business decisions facing France's conservative government. Both the West German and U.S. governments have become directly involved in the lobbying, turning it into a hot political issue that could lead to France alienating one of its two most important allies.    In Washington, the Reagan administration reacted cautiously to the French decision. Officials plainly were disappointed by the move, but they indicated it was unlikely the U.S. will take any retaliatory action. They noted Washington has few options in the matter.    Last month, however, Mark Fowler, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission threatened to retaliate against Siemens if the West German government blocked ATandamp;T's bid to buy CGCT. Equipment purchased by local Bell telephone companies in the U.S. must be approved by the FCC.    Bruce Smart, undersecretary of commerce for international trade, said the administration would have to study the details more closely. But he said it appeared that France had decided &quot;not to make its decision on commercial grounds,&quot; as the U.S. had urged; or to give foreign companies the same opportunities that are available to domestic firms, as international trading rules provide.    At stake is obtaining a 15% share of France's highly regulated and protectionist market for public digital switching equipment, currently held by CGCT. France's telecommunications authorities are seeking a second supplier of equipment besides Cie. Generale d'Electricite, which has an 85% market share and whose products are also made under license by CGCT.    French industry sources say that the only French telecommunications group that has the financial muscle to take over CGCT would be CGE, but the government's aim in selling CGCT is precisely to end a situation in which CGE is its only supplier.    ATandamp;T-Philips had initially bid for CGCT's market share, but the government then sought alternative offers from other companies, opening the door to the current wave of proposals.    But if the government intended to discourage at least one of the foreign bidders by maintaining the 20% limit on foreign ownership, its plan seems to have misfired. &quot;We've still got the foreign firms out there who want a piece of the action, whatever the rules are,&quot; a diplomat commented. &quot;It takes us back to the beginning.&quot;    &quot;It might have been done to gently eliminate the Americans,&quot; said one industry source, referring to the joint venture of ATandamp;T and Philips, which initially hoped for 60% of CGCT. &quot;I'm amazed that they're still trying,&quot; she added. &quot;They've been strung along for a year and a half. They must think they're dealing with a banana republic.&quot;    French officials deny that they were trying to force foreign bidders out. &quot;The problem of the second supplier is still raised,&quot; one official said. &quot;In public switching, there aren't many companies that can be competitive. There aren't any alternative candidates&quot; to manage CGCT besides the foreign groups, he said.    But the new rules mean that 80% of CGCT must be held by French groups. Officials say it's likely that there will be alliances between foreign bidders and French groups, probably Jeumont-Schneider, which has activities in private branch exchanges, such as switchboards, and Matra, which also has interests in private exchanges. Matra recently took over part of CGCT's private switching activities, and had originally been Ericsson's partner when the Swedish company bid for CGCT last year.    Officials at both Jeumont-Schneider and Matra yesterday confirmed that they were interested in developing their private switching branch, but expressed little desire to enter the public switching market other than in alliance with a foreign bidder. &quot;Public switching isn't our job, but we can think about an association with a foreign company that would own 20%,&quot; a Matra official said.    &quot;No French company other than CGE is big enough, so there will necessarily be a foreign partner that will be the leader. The government doesn't want to offend the Americans or the Germans, so it's groping for solutions,&quot; one industry source said. &quot;If there were an obvious French solution, it would have been found a long time ago.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
