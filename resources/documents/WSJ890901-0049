The Seattle aircraft manufacturer confirmed that Air Canada booked nine 767-300s with extended range, valued at roughly $936 million in all, and placed options for nine more.    Three of the firm orders and three related options are subject to reconfirmation. If all options are exercised, the transaction's value would total $1.87 billion.    &quot;It's a very good order,&quot; said Jerry Cantwell, an analyst with Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co. in New York. Generally, &quot;there's been a dearth of activity since the big surge this spring&quot; when United Airlines led a global buying frenzy with an order potentially worth $15.74 billion.    Then, late in July, Texas Air Corp. placed a $2.8 billion order with Boeing, the world's leading airplane maker, to upgrade its Continental and Eastern airlines units.    And, analysts said, there undoubtedly are more significant purchases on the way. Though orders as huge as United's are unlikely, &quot;airlines are looking to fill in gaps&quot; in their fleets, explained Lawrence Harris, of Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards, a Los Angeles securities firm. The reasons he cited are standard: growth in air traffic, the aging of the fleet, the fuel efficiency of the new models.    In fact, Boeing noted yesterday that Air Canada's 767-300s should consume up to 30% less fuel than the Lockheed Corp. L-1011s they replace. Direct operating costs will be about 25% lower than the L-1011, Boeing said, and flight range will increase 15%. The planes will use PW-4000 engines, made by the Pratt andamp; Whitney unit of United Technologies Corp.    Air Canada's president and chief executive officer, Pierre J. Jeanniot, said in a statement that the Montreal-based national carrier selected the 767-300 as its principle jetliner for long-range domestic and international service. &quot;This aircraft will become the backbone of Air Canada's fleet,&quot; Mr. Jeanniot said.    The first of Air Canada's new 767-300s, scheduled for delivery in 1993, will be used on North Atlantic routes.    Also yesterday, Aloha Airlines booked four 737-300 twinjets to meet growth and replacement needs. That deal is worth $125 million. The Honolulu-based carrier, a unit of Aloha Airgroup Inc., also took options for four more 737-300 airliners. Deliveries are to begin in November 1992.    The Aloha planes will be powered by CFM56-3C1 engines produced by CFM International, a joint venture of General Electric Co. and Snecma of France. The engine order is valued at $80 million.    Boeing's total backlog stands at 1,593 planes, up from 1,034 a year ago.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Boeing shares closed up 50 cents, at $54.75. </TEXT></DOC>
