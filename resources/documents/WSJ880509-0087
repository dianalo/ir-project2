The Wisconsin Democrat, in a blunt letter to SEC Chairman David Ruder, warned the agency against taking any administrative action on the one-share, one-vote issue. Sen. Proxmire asserted that the SEC lacks statutory authority to adopt rules on corporate governance, and he reminded Mr. Ruder that &quot;Congress is currently considering the question.&quot;    A majority of Banking Committee members, Sen. Proxmire added, shares his view that &quot;this is a major policy issue that should be determined by the U.S. Congress and not an independent regulatory agency.&quot;    Last June, after lengthy hearings, the SEC proposed a rule that would prohibit the nation's stock markets from listing companies that nullify, restrict or disproportionately reduce the voting rights of existing shareholders. But one exception to the rule would allow the listing of companies that had issued, often as a takeover defense, dual or multiple classes of stock with unequal voting rights by May 15, 1987.    Mary McCue, spokeswoman for Mr. Ruder, said that SEC attorneys are confident the commission has sufficient authority to adopt a uniform corporate-listing standard regarding voting rights. The April 20 letter from Sen. Proxmire, nonetheless, &quot;will have to figure in the commission's deliberations,&quot; she added.    Sen. Proxmire has been an outspoken critic of &quot;takeover mania,&quot; and an ardent defender of state corporation laws that allow multiple classes of stock. He sees the SEC's rule proposal as a federal pre-emption of state law.    The SEC, though preoccupied with the fallout from the October market crash, has been working on the rule. &quot;It's still very much alive,&quot; Ms. McCue said.    An aide to Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) said the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee believes the SEC does have the necessary authority, and unlike Sen. Proxmire, he favors administrative action on shareholder rights rather than legislation.    Rep. Dingell and other House Democrats have introduced comprehensive takeover legislation, including a one-share, one-vote provision, but for now they aren't pushing it. Rep. Dingell's aide likened the voting-rights provision to &quot;the shotgun behind the door,&quot; intended to spur SEC into action.    On the Senate side, meanwhile, the Banking Committee last December voted against mandating one share, one vote. Instead, the committee directed the SEC to study the impact of existing exchange rules on &quot;corporate suffrage.&quot; The agency is to report to Congress by October.    At a hearing March 17, Sen. Proxmire explained his stance on shareholder rights. &quot;The proponents of one share, one vote are really arguing against states rights in this area and are advocating federal pre-emption&quot; of those rights, he said. &quot;It is the quick-buck artists and takeover entrepreneurs who seek change.    &quot;They want to make it as easy as possible for companies to be put into play and taken over,&quot; Sen. Proxmire asserted. &quot;And a one-share, one-vote standard would certainly further that cause.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
