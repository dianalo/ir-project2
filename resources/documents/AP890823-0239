Only an estimated 30,000 of the Maynard-based company's 125,800employees would be affected by the memo, putting the total reductionin employees at about 7,500, analysts said.   Digital, the nation's second-largest computer manufacturer behindInternational Business Machines Corp., on Wednesday confirmedexistence of the memo, but said it was issued by a task force andwas not a firm company policy.   The memo said that to achieve the employee reductions, ``eachgroup will have to struggle with what work to discontinue. Anyproposed cuts would be made through attrition and transfer ofworkers whose jobs are eliminated to other divisions.''   ``They should not just shave expenses, but rather eliminateentire efforts,'' it said.   Nikki Richardson, a Digital spokeswoman, said the memo was ``nota real plan.''   ``It's a memo from a task force. Task forces do not makepolicy,'' she said.   ``We have a lot of task forces, a lot of committees,'' Ms.Richardson added. ``This was meant to generate internal discussion.''   Jobs affected by the proposed cutbacks are considered supportjobs, including those in the departments of administration, law,finance, personnel, purchasing, data information services,facilities, materials and quality.   Analysts said the cutbacks could affect departments employingabout 30,000 people.   Last week, Unisys Corp., the No. 3 U.S. computer maker, announcedplans to cut its worldwide work force by 7 percent to 8 percent bythe end of 1990, a reduction of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs that wouldinclude some layoffs.   Reasons cited for the cuts included ``weaker-than-expected U.S.demand and sharper competition in all industry segments worldwide.''   Digital's troubles began when interconnected personal computersbegan taking business away from the minicomputer market, Digital'sstronghold, according to George Colony, president of ForresterResearch Inc., a computer research firm in Cambridge.   ``Digital has been able to ride out ths storm for the lastseveral years because they were so dominant,'' Colony said. ``Butnow the storm is beginning to rock DEC's boat as well.''   In May, Digital tried to avoid work-force reductions through afreeze in salary increases and said it would move as many as 4,000employees from manufacturing to sales and service because of theslowdon in demand for its computers. But Colony said the company'ssituation is apparently more severe than it first appeared.   ``A fundamental restructuring of DEC is requried,'' Colony said.   He said Digital needs to commit itself to workstations andpersonal computers, and called the company's agreement to marketTandy Corp. personal computers ``half-hearted.'' Digital does notmake its own PCs.   The memo directs heads of affected departments to plan to cutbudgets by 10 percent for the fiscal year that began July 1.   ``It's not a plan, it's a working document ... a directionaldocument to promote ideas within the company,'' Ms. Richardson saidof the memo.   Digital announced last month that its profit for the quarterended June 30 was down 22 percent to $313.2 million compared to thesame period last year. Sales totaled $3.5 billion compared with $3.3billion a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
