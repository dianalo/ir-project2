December starts, propelled by falling interest rates, roseto a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.1 million from 1.07million in November, the Commerce Department said. Decembermortgage rates fell to an average of 8.5%, about one-quarterpoint below the previous month. Last month's constructionincrease followed a revised 1.4% decline in November.</LP><TEXT>   Actual starts for 1991, not seasonally adjusted, totaledone million, compared with 1.1 million in 1990. &quot;It wasdisastrous,&quot; said Thomas Holloway, economist for the MortgageBankers Association. Last year was the slowest since the325,000 starts in 1945, when a slightly different governmentsurvey method was used.   Economists expect an upturn in construction this month,following the huge, one-point rate decrease by the FederalReserve Board in late December. An informal member survey bythe mortgage bankers indicates record-level home refinancingsare continuing this month, and, more important, the surveyalso portends an increase in home sales and construction.&quot;The dramatic rate cuts are working their way into the systemnow,&quot; Mr. Holloway said.   In December, single-family home construction showed thebiggest improvement, rising 18% to a 948,000-unit annualrate. In contrast, the rate for multifamily building fellsteeply to 99,000 new units from 132,000 units. Buildingpermits, an indication of future construction, rose for both,by 5.8% to one million for single-family homes, and 13.5% to168,000 for multifamily homes.   Every region showed overall construction increases inDecember, except the West, where construction fell 6.7%. Allnumbers are seasonally adjusted.   The improved starts, however, aren't enough to kick theeconomy out of its doldrums, particularly with consumerconfidence indexes still in the tank. &quot;The single-familyhousing market seems like the only key piece of the economythat seems to be showing any life in the fourth quarter,&quot;said David Seiders, economist for the National Association ofHomebuilders.   He predicts 1.2 million homes will be built in 1992,including one million single-family homes.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          HOUSING STARTS of single-family homes rose 4.2% inDecember, according to Commerce Department figures.
