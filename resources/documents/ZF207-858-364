(products).andO;Product:   Relational Report Writer (Report generating software) (computerprograms)Relational Report Writer Code Generator (Program developmentsoftware).andO;Topic:     Software PackagesProgram Development ToolsEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>New version of Relational Report Write releasedandM;Concentric Data Systems, makers of 1-2-3 Report Writer and Relational ReportWriter, not only stole both of those markets, the firm made it appear thatthere were no alternatives.andM;In fact, there are a few, such as the Focus Report Writer for dBASE -- yetRandamp;R makes report generation so easy, and covers so many of the bases, thatalmost every programmer I know has licensed it.andM;Randamp;R has always exacted a hefty price from its users.andP;  To wit, the runtimemodule had to be loaded before running any report.andP;  Though it employed amemory-swapping technique to get around RAM limitations, the swap itself tooka while, the Concentric logo was visible as the runtime unit loaded, andthere was no communication (naturally) between the runtime module and yourown program.andM;Problems eliminatedandM;All these problems have now been eliminated, with Concentric's new add-oncalled Relational Report Writer Code Generator (RRCG).andP;  Programmers who donot want to rely on the runtime module now have an absurdly easy alternative.andM;RRCG expects that you have already created your reports using the full-blownRandamp;R.andP;  The new program then reads your .RP1 file, then writes the source code.andO;Command-line parameters let you specify the flavour (dBASE, FoxBASE,QuickSilver and Clipper are all supported) of generated code.andP;  Other optionsallow you to include or exclude the code required for several Randamp;R functionswhich have no equivalent in the dBASE dialects.andM;On my hard disk when the package arrived were about 20 Randamp;R report files, eachcontaining from 10 to 30 report specifications.andP;  To test the product out, Igenerated some of the code in dBASE IV, some in FoxBASE, and some in Clipper.andO;Only the Clipper code posed a slight problem -- one of the modules generatedis named QUERY(), which conflicts with a function of the same name inArtful.Lib.andP;  A few seconds in QEDIT fixed this in all the Clipper files.andP;  Thecode executed without incident in all three environments.andM;One of the great strengths of Randamp;R has been its printer support.andP;  Print specs(boldface etc.) are saved as part of the report, but the printer definitionis done with a separate module -- thus leaving you free to define anotherprinter anytime, without changes to the report.andM;To recreate this pattern in RRCG, Concentric added a utility called RRCGMEM,which creates memory files containing printer control strings for allprinters listed in the printer configuration file.andP;  The program simplyrestores from one of these files, then runs the report.andP;  This is aseffortless as it gets, folks.andM;The formula for successful software seems obvious -- find a gaping hole inthe marketplace, fill it definitively, and price the result reasonably.andO;Remarkably few companies manage the feat, however.andM;Arthur Fuller is a Toronto-based freelance applications developer.andP;  He isalso the author of Dynamics of Clipper (published by Dow Jones Irwin, 1988)</TEXT></DOC>
