Betti, the Pentagon's top procurementofficial who was roundly criticized last week in an internal reporton mismanagement in a $50 billion stealth aircraft program, saidWednesday he was resigning.   Betti, a former Ford Motor Co. executive who had beenundersecretary of defense for acquisition for 16 months, said inhis letter of resignation he would leave effective Dec. 31 so hewould not be covered by new ethics laws next year that imposetougher post-employment restrictions on former governmentofficials.   In his letter of resignation, Betti made no mention of theunfolding story of mismanagement in the development of the Navy'sA-12 attack plane.   Speaking privately, two Pentagon officials said Betti hadintended to leave soon anyway but the timing of his announcementwas connected to the recent revelations about the A-12 beingdeveloped by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.   One of the two said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plans toslash the responsibilities of the job also led Betti to quit.   A Navy admiral was forced to retire last week and two otherofficers were reassigned after disclosure that they had failed topass word up the chain of command about cost increases and scheduledelays in the A-12.   The A-12, called the Avenger, is a radar-evading ``stealth''plane supposed to replace the elderly A-6 aboard carriers startingin 1995.   Betti's office referred calls to a Defense Departmentspokeswoman, who said she had no information on whether Bettialready had lined up a new job.   In a written statement, Betti said he believed he hadconsiderably improved the Pentagon's oft-criticized purchasingsystem. But he also said ``substantive, lasting improvements indefense acquisition will not occur overnight.   ``Rather it will be a long, slow and arduous process requiringpatience and constancy of purpose.''   Cheney, in a letter accepting the resignation, also made nomention of the A-12 controversy and told Betti ``Your dedicated andsuccessful efforts to strengthen the acquisition process ... havebeen instrumental in maintaining a strong national defense.''   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed ServicesCommittee, said Betti's resignation ``shows how resistant thePentagon is to change.'' Aspin said the job was created by Congress``to buy weapons that work on time and at cost,'' but was soon tobe vacant for the third time in four years.   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the GovernmentOperations Committee, said the resignation ``would not put an endto the cozy old-boy's network at the Pentagon, where problems areswept under the rug while airplanes crash and contractors reapunearned billions.''   The A-12 development program is now a year behind schedule and20 percent over the planned $4.7 billion cost.   Defense Department Inspector General Susan J. Crawford said in areport last week that word of the problems didn't reach Cheney andother top Pentagon officials in large part because the contractorshad control over the work done by government inspectors.   But she also said Betti had been informed of some of theproblems by a deputy but ``failed to report the conclusions reachedby his own staff regarding the A-12.''   ``Mr. Betti relied on general assurances, which he invited, fromthe contractor and prior Navy assurances that the A-12 developmentcontract would be completed within ceiling costs,'' Crawford'sreport said. ``We find Mr. Betti's failure especially troublesomein view of a prior warning.''   The A-12 controversy was not the first time Betti has facedcriticism for his office's policies.   In July, Betti faced hostile questioning from a members of acongressional panel who demanded he accept a Justice Departmentrecommendation that Northrop Corp. be barred from Pentagon businessfor its criminal fraud conviction on charges it faked testsinvolving nuclear cruise missiles.   Betti rejected the demands but admitted he had never reviewedevidence from several federal investigations of Northrop's conduct.In the same testimony he also acknowledged he was not aware themilitary had repeatedly waived contract requirements for cruisemissiles, even after allegations of misconduct arose and a federalprosecutor warned that such waivers could harm the government'scase against Northrop.   ``You don't know what your managers are doing, your managersdon't know what Northrop is doing, your costs are going up and youhave criminal investigations going on,'' Committee Chairman Rep.John Dingell, D-Mich., said at the July hearing. ``I am worriedthat no one knows what is going on.''</TEXT></DOC>
