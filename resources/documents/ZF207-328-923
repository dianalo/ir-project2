(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PreVIEW: CADD-Minded Groupware Streamlines Drawing Review, AnnotationEngineering and architectural drawing review can be a sloppy, time-consumingprocess.andP;  PreVIEW, a new package from Rosetta Technologies, offers astreamlined alternative to marking up drawings by hand.andM;PreVIEW makes it easy to plot, annotate, and compare drawings from other CADDsystems.andP;  Installed on a standalone PC, it transforms its host into apowerful drawing comment and review station.andP;  Installed on a network, itallows drawings to be stored on the server and accessed from individualstations running PreVIEW.andM;The package accepts files in two formats--IGES and Cal-Comp plot.andP;  With IGES,you'll be able to bring drawings into PreVIEW from almost any othermainframe- or microcomputer-based CADD system, including AutoCAD.andP;  In therare cases in which IGES isn't available as an output option, CalComp.andP;  plotformat probably will be.andM;In addition to its DOS support, PreVIEW supports Unix-based Sun-3workstations and Apollo workstations running DOMAIN/IX or AEGIS.andP;  It supportsIBM's PCLocal Area Network Program (PC LAN) and Sun NFS (Network File System)network.andM;After an IGES or CalComp drawing file is converted into a PreVIEW drawingfile with a utility PreVIEW includes, it can be called up and displayed as ifit were in its native CADD format.andP;  For viewing, PreVIEW offers all thefunctions of a CADD system: panning, zooming, windowing, and the ability tohide or display drawing layers.andM;In addition, through a mechanism known as the &quot;stack,&quot; you can lay up tothree drawings on top of one another and display them simultaneously.andO;Comparing drawings for changes between revisions has never been easier.andM;PreVIEW really shines when it comes to annotating drawings with graphics andtext.andP;  If you want to comment a drawing and pass it back to its originator,you simply insert a blank overlay into the three-tiered drawing stack andselect Annotate from the main menu.andP;  Notes and sketches are added to theoverlay so that the original drawing file isn't changed.andP;  Another option letsyou output annotations to an IGES file, where comments can easily beincorporated back into the original.andM;PreVIEW's annotation functions, which let you draw circles, arcs, lines,boxes, arrows, text, and freehand figures, work in a smooth, logical mannerthat minimizes the amount of time you'll spend learning to use them.andP;  And ifyou make a mistake, no problem--just select Undo or Edit from the Annotatemenu to correct it.andM;PreVIEW's ability to handle drawing files goes beyond flat 2-D viewing.andP;  For3-D models imported through IGES, it permits you to change the position ofthe viewpoint in space and then generate new drawing files and plots from thenew view.andM;On the downside, PreVIEW's automatic installation program ranks as one of themost obnoxious ever devised.andP;  After revising your CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BATfiles for you, it promptly litters your root directory with unwantedsubdirectories and fills them with files and even more subdirectories.andP;  Theinstallation program asks you what drive you'd like to install PreVIEW on butstill copies a portion of PreVIEW to drive C:--even if you specify adifferent drive letter.andP;  And when you're asked to designate the port yourmouse is attached to, the dedicated mouseport featured on IBM's PS/2 machinesis conspicuously absent.andP;  If you use a serial version Microsoft Mouse with aPS/2, you'll have to disconnect it from the mouseport and plug it into theserial port.andP;  If you have an IBM mouse, you're out of luck.andM;Despite these shortcomings, PreVIEW is a powerful package that illustrateshow workgroup software can benefit engineering and scientific organizations.andO;Whether you use it on an independent PC or in conjunction with a network,you're sure to agree that it beats the red-pencil approach to reviewing andcommenting drawings.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
