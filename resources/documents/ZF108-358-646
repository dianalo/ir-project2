 Now, more than ever, the commonground that long-document publishers once shared is being eaten away by therealization that each business application has very specific requirementsthat are not germane to the publishing industry as a whole--and notnecessarily even to other producers of long documents.andM;This article focuses on changes for one type of document publisher--largemanufacturing organizations that produce in-house documentation to supporttheir products.andP;  The Seminars covered other long-document applictaions(scholarly books, for example), but their requirements are sufficientlyspecific as to fall outside the realm of this discussion.andM;New buying options.andP;  Only a few years ago, the process of buying a largepublishing system to rpdouce long documents was relatively straightforward.andO;If you were a corporate publisher (one for whom publishing is not the corebusiness), your situation likely fell into one of two categories: systempurchases influenced by MIS or those that were set up for dedicated use in apublishing department.andP;  In the former category, your purchase optionsdepended to a great extent on the hardware your MIS department recommended.andO;If you had IBM mainframes, you bought IBM's DCF.andP;  If you had Vaxes, youbought Datalogics or Versacomp.andP;  If, on the other hand, you were a publishingor graphics department that wanted a dedicated system, you were likely toturn to Xyvision, Interleaf or Texet.andM;Today the situation is radically different.andP;  For starters, it is now possibleto build small and medium-sized systems by networking desktop computers(Macs, PCs or workstations).andM;Corporate publishers that already have micro-based networks can in some casesbuild a networked publishing system from off-the-shelf software.andP;  Many userspurchased Mac and PC desktop publishing tools to put control of the pages inthe hands of authors and editors.andM;At the same time, document-oriented publishing software for Unix workstationshas become more readily available at lower prices.andP;  Engineering departmentsnow purchase software with which engineers can write and produce their owndocumentation.andP;  Again, the trend has been to move control over printed pagesinto the hands of authors and editors.andM;The trend toward editorial control parallels the merger of publishing intothe mainstream of computing.andP;  And, as noted in our article on the industry atlarge, as the general computer market begins to provide the basic componentsof networked publishing systems, suppliers of turnkey publishing systems arebecoming a rare breed.andP;  This is a particularly true in the corporate market,where customers are increasingly turning away from self-contained publishingsystems in favor of publishing systems that are integrated with (or at leastinterfaced to) other applications on the network.andM;Shifting focus.andP;  As control of the publishing process moves upstream towardthose creating and manipulating content, the editorial focus shifts fromproduction of pages to examination of content and possible alternativepresentation formats.andP;  The pressure behind this shift comes from externalforces, such as new products entering the market or initiatives like CALS, aswell as from within the organization itself.andM;Recent feedback from high-volume documentation publishers and vendorsindicates that producing pages will not be their primary concern in the1990s.andP;  As the focus turns from production to content, the questions seem tobe changing to how to mix a content-oriented database with publishing (i.e.,andO;information delivery) tools.andP;  Two aspects of this problem are discussed inthis article:andM;* Restructuring databases to prepare for the future.andP;  Even if a company hadthe good fortune to standardize on one or two products, the transition fromdelivering paper documents to electronic information may be a formidableand/or expensive challenge.andM;The defense aerospace and large computer hardware industries are twoexamples: the former is spending considerable money and time figuring out howto deliver documentation in CALS formats for the DoD; the latter isundergoing a similar process in trying to deliver computer documentation onCD-ROMs.andP;  In both cases, the users are discovering that today's solutions areinevitably short-term answers.andP;  In the long run, the more difficult challengewill be defining how those who create information will structure and encodeit so that those who manage it, extract it, deliver it and retrieve it can doso without great difficulty or expense.andM;* Integrating publishing with other applications.andP;  The proliferation ofdesktop publishing tools purchased ad hoc by different departments has been adouble-edged sword for many companies.andP;  It has enabled them to dramaticallylower production costs and shorten the production cycle.andP;  But a decentralizedapproach has also encouraged purchasing of software without regard forconsistency across departmental boundaries.andP;  Now, when the company looks atintegrating publishing and information management among several departments,it may face an intimidating maze of discrete databases with little in common.andM;The chalenge of system integration, which was never easy, is compounded todayby difficulties of supporting multiple computer platforms, a variety ofsoftware and ever-changing document needs.andP;  Users are facing a dauntingtask--and wondering where to turn for help.andM;But don't forget .andP;  .  .  The issues discussed here relate primarily toinformation and the tools used to manipulate it.andP;  But before those issues canbe successfully tackled, users must first wrestle with an equally criticalchallenge:andM;* Assessing the dynamics off the organization.andP;  The organization of mostcorporate publishing departments is based on a final product that is printedinformation.andP;  Authors, illustrators, designers and production personnel worktoward a common goal of delivering the documentation as soon as possibleafter engineering and manufacturing say the product is ready to ship.andP;  Beforethe computer and publishing problems are tackled, it is necessary to defineand evaluate the organization--people, their roles and their relationshipsamong themselves and to the overall framework of the company.andM;As Tom Hawkins of Martin Marietta pointed out, it may take a large companyyears to develop a reasonable model of its internal organization, and thatmodel is almost a prerequisite for successfully overhauling your informationdatabase.andM;We'll return to the role of people within the organization following a lookat the changes in technology.andM;Structuring InformationandM;Constructing a working model of your organization is a good first step toentering the 1990s, but the second step may be even more difficult:constructing a model of your information.andP;  For producers of documentation,the challenge in the 1990s will be to move from pages as the basic unit oftext to a model in which content is accessible separate from its physicalpresentation.andM;Yuri Rubinsky of SoftQuad put the current dilemma in a historical context.andO;Tracing the evolution of how we as humans have interacted with documents,Rubinsky showed this progression:andM;* The Page.andP;  Monks dealt with manuscripts in basic units of a page.andM;* The Character.andP;  Gutenberg reduced composition to working with singlecharacters at a time as part of the printing process.andM;* The Line.andP;  The line-casting machines moved composition from characters tolines.andM;* The Page.andP;  The WYSIWYG composition systems brought us back to working withdocuments in units of a page.andM;* The Document.andP;  Publishers are now using SGML to separate their content fromthe procedure of formatting it for presentation.andM;* The Document Database.andP;  The next step is to separate the content from itsstructure, so that it may be mapped to multiple structures.andM;* The Document Database.andP;  Eventually, we will get to the point of separatingthe content from all access and presentation procedures and structures.andP;  Atthat point, the document becomes a dynamic entity--information that can beprogrammed, not just fed into pages.andP;  (Such possibilities were glimpsed inInterleaf's technology demonstration; see Product Demonstrations followingthis article.)andM;Modelling content dataandM;How does one achieve Rubinsky's nirvana?andP;  One suggestion came from the panelon CALS, the Computer-aided Acquisition and Logistics Support initiative ofthe U.S.andP;  Department of Defense.andM;The Air Force has embarked on a project called the Content Data Model todefine a model for the content of data describing an aircraft weapons system.andO;Its purpose is to break down the documentation into discrete objects, each ofwhich represents content, or meaning.andP;  This makes it possible for the personretrieving information to search on content, rather than structure.andP;  Forexample, instead of viewing documentation as chapters, the reader (or viewer)might see topics--wing, fuel system, instrument panel and so forth.andM;The idea is that the organization of the content need not be linear.andP;  In aself-directed on-line help system, for example, the user might follow any oneof several paths, depending on the information sought.andP;  The Content DataModel would allow multiple views of the same content and support differentstructures and styles for organizing and presenting the information to theend user.andM;What model is appropriate?andP;  One of the stumbling blocks to creating a contentmodel is figuring out what the overall structure of the model looks like.andP;  Isit a relational database model?andP;  That seems too restricted by most accounts.andO;Is it an object-based model?andP;  The computer industry seems in agreement thatan object-based model holds considerable potential, but as Frank Gilbane ofPublishing Technology Management pointed out, although there is agreement onhow such a model would work, there is no consensus on what an object is.andP;  Arepresentative from Claris pointed out in the discussion that followed thathis company has defined more than a million object types, yet he has no ideaif any of these are in common with the ones being used by the Air Force.andO;Still others ask if the hierarchical model of objects will work for hypertextdatabases, which are inherently nonhierarchical.andP;  They postulate that anetwork view, such as is used in organizational communication theory, mightbe more appropriate.andM;Rubinsky suggested that what we need is not an architecture, or model, but alanguage for defining architectures.andP;  He proposed a new acronym to describethe goal: GWYN (get what you need).andM;Why overhaul what works?andP;  Your in-house documentation department may be quitecomfortable with its present procedures for producing pages.andP;  Why shake itall up by trying to create a new database?andM;There are sound economic reasons for making this transition.andP;  They boil downto a basic tenet: information is too valuable to be used only once.andM;For publishers of documentation, either information has become an essentialingredient in their products or services, or it is the product.andP;  Suchpublishers can no longer afford to keep updating redundant information.andP;  Toremain competitive, they need to be able to make the best use of theinformation that has become in itself an asset of the company.andM;Second, modeling the content of your information is not limited to theaerospace or CALS markets.andP;  In fact, speakers from Martin Marietta andMdDonnell Douglas (see below) affirmed that their comapnies are no longerdoing CALS for CALS's sake.andP;  They are planning to overhaul theirdocumentation databases for their own sake because of the payback they see inthe years ahead across all of their products, both commercial andgovernment-sponsored.andM;Third, the process of modeling content is not just a documentation issue.andO;The process is intertwined with efforts to apply concurrent engineering andquality control throughout a product's entire life cycle, from design tomanufacturing through to maintenance in the field.andP;  The better theinformation model, the more likely the company will be able to adapt thecontent to a structure or format tailored to an end user's requirements.andM;First-hand experiences.andP;  Martin Marietta and McDonnell Douglas Aircraft, bothAir Force suppliers, are among the first publishers in the industry to beginmaking the transition from stacks of looseleaf pages to alternative deliverysystems.andP;  The lessons they learn as they blaze the trail make the path thatmuch easier to those who follow.andP;  Tom Hawkins of Marietta and Bob Jackson ofMc-Air discussed how the Content Data Model affects them as publishers.andM;For starters, the process is not a quick one, nor is it for the faint ofheart.andP;  Documentation databases the size of those of aerospace manufacturersare not restructured in an afternoon as a magical batch process.andP;  The volumeof pages is tremendous; breaking the pages down into discrete content objectsmakes the material seem even more complex than before.andP;  Yet both of theseusrs see the long-term objective--a corporate-wide integrated technicalinformation system (CITIS)--as a key element of their company's efforts toremain competitive in the market.andP;  If the information they supply with theirproducts makes the products easier to install, learn, use and maintain, thenthey as manufacturers have an advantage in the marketplace.andM;Bob Jackson gave a concrete example of how the Content Data Model might helpMcDonnell customers.andP;  The customer who wants information on a topic, usingcurrent documentation, often has to know specific information, like documentor part numbers.andP;  The Content Data Model would make it possible to link thedata to the display software so that the user might access data bynomenclature, tasks, diagnostics, graphics or other topics, rather than justfrom part numbers, contents pages or alphabetical indexes.andM;Jackson cautioned, however, against viewing the Content Data Model as adatabase specification.andP;  To be truly useful, the model should work forinformation exchange, not just internal manipulation (see illustration onnext page).andP;  Thus, the Content Data Model describes technical informationindependent of the database format--Jackson believes it is likely thatcontractor and customer will have different database tools, yet both willneed access to the information database.andM;What should publishers do?andM;Despite the swirl of confusion, some practical ideas emerged for thoseentering the new age of documentation.andP;  There is no clear path frompublishing long documents to database publishing, but here, at least, arestarting points:andM;* Code meaning, not structure.andP;  Even though the details of the models may notbe ironed out, users can begin sorting out the content from the actionsapplied to it in their own documentation.andP;  Part of this process is coding themeaning of the information in a way that is independent of hardware andsoftware applications, and preferably independent of structure.andP;  (Code thepart, not a heading.)andP;  At this time, SGML is the most likely language to useto write your encoding.andP;  It separates both form and structure from thecontent; only the content is encoded in an SGML database.andP;  The structure isdefined separaely in the Document Type Definition (DTD).andP;  The rules that areapplied to extract and present the information are part of the formatter.andM;* Take a leadership role.andP;  Those who create and edit content are in the bestposition to ensure that information is stored in a way that can be reused bya variety of applications throughout the organization.andP;  Moving informationfrom pages to a content-based database is a complex process that will mostlikely require the aid of people with computer expertise.andP;  But publishers arethe ones who understand the content of the information; their expertise isinvaluable in making the transition a success.andM;Who Integrates Your System?andM;The move away from turnkey documentation systems has placed a huge burden onmost users--they must now take much more responsibility for computerintegratio than ever before.andP;  Even users who contract with an outsidesupplier for integration must become more active and knowledgeable abouttheir computer systems than they were in the past.andP;  This is the bitter pillthat must be swallowed to receive the beneficial effects of increased controland flexibility that characterize the &quot;fourth wave&quot; of publishing technology.andM;We have covered the issue of system integration at great length in the alstseveral years.andP;  At this year's Seminars, a new metaphor was applied to thequestion of finding a supplier--that of prime contractors.andM;Prime contractors.andP;  The aerospace industry has used the concept of primecontractors successfully for decades.andP;  Essentially, the customer develops aset of product requirements and solicits proposals.andP;  The requirementstypically go far beyond what can be found in commercially available products.andO;Therefore, it is assumed that the contractors bidding on the job will notdevelop all of the product themselves--that would make the productprohibitively expensive and time-consuming to develop.andP;  Instead, the primecontractor assumes the burden of delivering and supporting an integratedsystem as a cohesive whole, but the design and manufacturing of that systemis a process that involves hundreds, even thousands, of subcontractors, eachof whom provide a piece of the overall system.andM;A fourth-wave publishing system uses similar principles.andP;  Rather thandeveloping the entire system itself (a la Atex and SII newspaper systems inthe early 1980s), the contractor builds a system by finding commerciallyavailable products and welding them together.andP;  Typically, the primecontractor must develop the mortar that binds the building bricks togetherinto a unified structure that functionally and aesthetically satisfies thecustomer.andM;Who is this prime contractor?andP;  As in the past, it may well be a largecomputer company.andP;  It may also be a publishing vendor.andP;  For small companies,it might be a local integration specialist.andP;  And, of course, it could be thecustomer himself.andM;System suppliers as contractorsandM;System integration is nothing new to large computer companies--they have beendoing it for decades.andP;  What is new is the need for publishing awareness fromcomputer suppliers.andM;Few of the leading vendors fully grasp publishers' requirements.andP;  A few havelearned from wrestling with their own internal documentation problems and areapplying the lessons to their products and in training their support staff.andM;DEC: applying its own experiences.andP;  Digital Equipment is the best example ofa platform vendor addressing publishing as a network activity.andP;  As Digital'sproducts enter international markets, it is struggling to manage and controlthe process of producing the accompanying documentation, which must betailored to the language of each country, even as its volume burgeons intomillions of pages.andP;  At DEC, the company became its own prime contractor andin so doing realized that it had the opportunity to provide not only mortarbut structural components, such as network publishing services, that wouldfacilitate commercial products and serve other prime contractors that choseto use DEC hardware.andP;  Prototypes of several new system services were shown ithe exhibit area (see Product Demonstrations).andM;DEC's strategy is to act as prime contractor for very large accounts but toserve as a key subcontractor for publishing vendors that also take on primecontractor roles.andP;  Two such partners are Odesta and Xyvision.andM;IBM: the cryptic strategy.andP;  IBM, like DEC, recognizes the need for publishingexpertise at a system level, but it has been much slower than DEC to developa cohesive publishing strategy that can be seen in network-wide products.andO;Its compound document architecture is still unpublished; it has yet to showstrong support for other computer platforms; and the integration of its ownseparate platforms under one software architecture is progressing at apainfully slow pace.andP;  Like DEC, IBM has strategic partners, such as Kodak(Atex), but it has not done nearly as much in the way of publishing servicesat a system level.andM;Will Apple and Microsoft address larger systems?andP;  Apple and Microsoft aredeveloping some system support for publishing, but in both cases theirofferings are based on limited operating systems that at most large companiesare only a subset of the overall computing environment.andM;Microsoft now seems to be backpedaling away from its move to larger systems.andO;At one time, it said that OS/2 would be the platform of the future, and thatWindows was merely an interim step.andP;  Now Microsoft, catering to a mass marketthat is balking at OS/2, is devoting more resources to beefing up Windows.andM;Steve Ballmer of Microsoft explained the new focus on Windows by using anautomotive simile, comparing MS-DOS to a Ford Taurus and OS/2 to a LincolnContinental.andP;  His point was that MS-DOS, with Windows, will be the basictransportation vehicle, and OS/2 will be a luxury most personal computerusers will not need.andP;  A more apt comparison might be made by comparing MS-DOSto a 1979 Ford van, with a standard transmission and no air conditioning--acreaky old engine with a body being eaten by rust, but basic transportationnonetheless.andM;The irony of Ballmer's description of OS/2 as a Continental is that forprofessional publishers OS/2 is the Taurus: few publishers with largenetworks will be able to settle for MS-DOS in the 1990s, no matter how muchthe van is made more attractive with options like Windows.andP;  Ballmer'sassertion that the new font technologies will &quot;just work&quot; in Windows may havebeen an unintentional double entendre meaning &quot;just barely&quot;--even a naivecustomer knows there's only so much rebuilding an old engine will take beforeyou have to face up to the reality of trading it in for a new car.andM;Jim Lennane brought this point home in a tongue-in-cheek monologue aboutMicrosoft's internal struggles.andP;  Lennane countered Ballmer's &quot;It will justwork&quot; with &quot;Just get OS/2 done.&quot;andP;  The shifting of resources to Windows isfrustrating the publishing community, and they may not wait if Microsoft bogsdown.andM;The OS/2 question aside, now that both Apple and Microsoft are entering theUnix market, they have the opportunity to tackle network publishing servicesthat operate independent of hardware.andP;  If they don't, their role ascontractors for documentation publishers may be limited to the departmentalor small-company level.andM;Unix vendors: still in the dark?andP;  Most other large computer suppliers havebeen content to ignore publishing as much as possible, leavinb publishingcontracts to special task forces, typically sales groups that works onfederal contracts.andP;  For example, most of the Unix vendors have taken athird-party approach to publishing--that is, they are relying on third-partydevelopers to provide solutions for publishers.andP;  (Intergraph is a notableexception in the Unix market.)andP;  The danger of this approach is is that if thecustomer's requirements call for publishing to be incorporated into otheraspects of an organization's business (such as its research, manufacturing orsupport operations), then it may ask the platform vendor to act as primecontractor and provide the glue between publishing and other applications.andM;Third-party developers will continue to offer end-user tools for publishing.andO;But database, file and document management software that works for publishingas well as engineering applications may become a key differentiator forplatform vendors in the 1990s.andM;A related differentiator will be the platform vendor's willingness, as primecontractor, to supply pieces based on another vendor's hardware.andP;  The harshreality for hardware manufacturers in the 1990s is that closed shops willbecome monuments to the past.andP;  The platform vendors best able to serve asprime contractors for publishers will be those that developed open-endedsystems with the fourth wave in mind.andM;The publishing vendor as primeandM;Now that all three of the original WYSIWYG technical documentation systems(Compugraphic CAPS, Interleaf and Xyvision) are based on general-purposecomputers, and their suppliers can longer depend on hardware sales, thesevendors are turning to system integration as a core business.andP;  Interleafrecently decided that it will no longer even sell hardware as part of itssystem, and all three companies have set up special groups whose charter issystem integration on a prime-contractor basis.andP;  This is a positive trend,because it is happening just as customers are looking to integrate theirpage-based publishing tools with other editorial and database applications.andM;As a general rule, the publishing vendors are much more in tune withpublishers' problems than are platform vendors.andP;  They are more likely to haveencountered problems similar to yours, and they realize more readily(sometimes) that their products do not address all needs.andP;  More important,because they focus exclusively on publishing, these vendors often haveexpertise that is hard to find anywhere else.andM;Such expertise can be expensive.andP;  Larry Liebson of Xyvision noted that hiscompany cannot afford to get involved with an integration contract for lessthan $500,000.andP;  With publishing vendors, system integration will not beburied in hardware costs--it will be a direct line item on the bill.andP;  Thecost of using a platform vendor--or even yourself--might be as much as ormore than doing to a publishing vendor, but management at some firms hastrouble approving system integration.andP;  There is the unwarranted expectationin the computer and publishing industries that with systems integration willcome for free.andM;That expectation has to change as the publishing industry changes in the1990s.andP;  Expertise may be expensive, but it can also be much morecost-effective than doing without it.andM;Consider, for example, how expensive it is to build a home without theexpertise of a contractor.andP;  Even if you have the desire, time and tools, ifit is your first try how much will you spend over the course of your stay inthe house in fixing your mistakes, in the time not spent living there becauseit wasn't done, in time spent building that you would rather have spent doingsomething else, and so forth?andP;  Yes, your initial capital outlay may be farless, but in the long run the expertise of a professional usually warrants ahigher price.andM;In the aerospace industry, the charge for system integration is part of theoverall package price.andP;  It is understood that the prime contractor will besupplying a custom system, and that part of the price is expertise in makingthe system work as a whole.andP;  If the prime contractor model holds true fordocumentation publishers, the same will be true in publishing in the 1990s.andM;The local prime contractorandM;For small companies looking to build a networked systems from microcomputersat a modest cost, the local system integrator may be the best alternative todoing it yourself.andP;  A good example is the growing base of Ventura Publisherintegrators who add the network features, system setup, training and supportthe local software outlet doesn't provide.andP;  Yes, Xerox offers a networkedversion of Ventura, but no, it is not a turnkey multiuser documentationsystem.andP;  The same is true of Mac-based programs.andP;  Odesta is the first vendorto act as a prime contractor for Mac-based network documentation; a localsystem integrator may have other suggestions.andM;The alternative: DIYandM;There is an alternative to the prime-contractor method: do it yourself.andP;  Thisalternative involves assuming all responsibility for system integrationyourself as end user, buying hardware, softwre and subsystems that you piecetogether into a whole.andM;Mike May of Westland Helicopter discussed the ups and downs of this approach.andO;The up side is having control and the illusion that you're not spending asmuch money as if you went outside.andP;  The down side, of course, is theresponsibility, which brings with it headaches, frustration and, inevitably,disappointments.andM;May elaborated, using his own experience playing the saxophone to illustrate.andO;He wanted to play like Charlie Parker.andP;  Now, years later, though good enoughto play for money, he has not realized his goal.andP;  He cited several reasons,among them:andM;* Buying a craftsman's tool did not make him a genius.andM;* Lay practitioners do not practice enough to become experts.andM;* It takes the help and advice of someone with expertise to become aprofessional craftsman.andM;Westland was lucky in that it had the resources to tackle the integrationproblems of linking an SGML database for aerospace documentation to apublishing system.andP;  But May offered this advice to others taking this course:it's no sin to budget for system integration, particularly when your ownneeds may change as the project evolves.andM;ConclusionandM;For large manufacturers of documentation-intensive products, the 1990spromise to usher in a new era in which we redefine how we interact with thecontent of support documentation.andP;  Pages of paper will thrive as an effectivemedium--if for no other reason than humans' centuries-old cultural rhetoricfor books.andP;  But books are proving too cumbersome when the documentation forone product exceeds several thousand pages (and in some cases tens andhundreds of thousands).andP;  Information customers, whether they be maintenancetechnicians on an aircraft carrier, a mechanic in a car dealership, or ateacher in a school computer lab, are looking for documentation that isquickly accessible, readily understood, and relevant to the question at hand.andM;User preparation makes the difference.andP;  Regardless of what our database lookslike or who is our integrator, the key to successful use of new technologylies in the end user's talent, preparation and sweat.andP;  The tools needed todayare more powerful but also more complex than those of the past.andP;  Finding theright tool requires careful analysis of the task, the objectives, the humanresources available and the money allocated, all before equipment selectionbegins.andM;Even then, finding the right tool is only a step in the overall process,because buying the best tool does not by itself get the job done.andP;  Vendorssupply tools and, in some cases, site analysis and training.andP;  But the burdenof learning how and when to use the tools purchased ultimately rests on thecustomer.andM;Larry Liebson took May's comments one step farther by outlining some of thecharacteristics that have distinguished the Xyvision customers that succeededin reaching their goals from the ones that did not.andP;  Xyvision found thatthose that succeed:andM;* Focus on business solutions.andP;  Customers that buy equipment based on clearbusiness objectives can better apply the tools to the task at hand.andO;Customers that buy technology for the sake of having it often fail to makethe technology help them solve their problems.andM;* Focus on organizational and cultural issues.andP;  &quot;Never deny or underestimatethe importance of emotions in introducing new technology,&quot; cautioned Liebson.andO;The fact is that change makes many people nervous.andP;  Comapnies that succeedkeep their employees informed, ask for and act on their input, and try to bepatient.andM;* Focus on training and support.andP;  Companies that successfully recognize thecultural impact of technology also respect the need for plenty of trainingand support--and budget time and money accordingly.andP;  Liebson urged theaudience to consider the importance of the system when estimating supportcosts.andP;  A mission-critical system requires far more support than one thatsees casual use.andM;* Focus on results.andP;  Comapnies that succeed measure their progress againstrealistic, step-by-step objectives that relate to the overall business plan.andM;In the 1990s, system integration will become even more complex as in-housepublishers struggle to unify multiple computers and myriad of softwareapplications.andP;  Yet the most critical factor may have nothing to do withequipment or suppliers.andP;  None of the elements of Liebson's list are suppliedby vendors; all are part of what the publisher contributes.andP;  How well thepublisher prepares for the transition process may be the deciding factor indetermining to what degree the company succeeds in integrating publishingwith other technologies in the 1990s.andM;Context pushes electronic distributionandM;The Context division of Mentor Graphics has integrated several steps inpaperless publishing with its BOLD (Better On-Line Delivery) system, which itintroduced in the Showcase.andP;  BOLD enables users to transform technicaldocuments into an indexed, WYSIWYG, annotable form for distribution.andP;  The&quot;composed&quot; documents are medium-independent, but Context offers a CD-ROMDeveloper's Kit that simplifies document distribution on that medium.andM;The main target markets for BOLD are manufacturing, engineering and technicalpublishing.andP;  Context's idea is that a company will compile technical manualsusing BOLD, then distribute them (most likely in CD-ROM form) to users--e.g.,andO;maintenance technicians--with the software the end users need to view them,annotate them and perform full-text searches on them.andP;  This process isdesigned to speed the distribution of documents, thus making them morecurrent.andM;Context used Sun's News display technology to produce a simple, intuitiveuser interface for the BOLD system.andP;  All other parts of the system werecreated in-house.andM;Modular construction.andP;  The first module, the BOLD Composer, translatesdocuments created in Context's DOC or other publishing systems into a formsuitable for electronic delivery.andP;  The Composer accepts information inPostScript, ASCII, CGM, IGES, TIFF and HPGL formats.andP;  For documents createdin DOC, the Composer automatically creates hypertext links between the textand tables of contents, indexes and references; the user can create otherlinks.andP;  For documents created elsewhere, the user must establish all desiredlinks.andM;The Composer also builds a full-text index, and it converts text and graphicsto a format that permits fast display.andM;The next component, the Browser, lets the user view the document (at anypercentage of actual size), perform complex text searches, add annotations orbookmarts, print portions of the document, and copy elements for useelsewhere.andM;One or two pages can be displayed at a time.andP;  The page-turn command can beconfigured to move forward anywhere from one to four pages.andP;  To speedrepainting, the user can turn off the display of graphics or tables.andM;Within the Browser, the user can jump between linked portions of the document(for instance, from a table of contents entry to the listed page) and addfuther links.andP;  The user can also construct &quot;themes&quot;--collections of pagesselected from anywhere in the library.andM;The full-text search can cover all documents in the BOLD library or onlyselected ones.andP;  It lets the user define boolean operators (including anumber-of-words proxiomity threshold), choose to match alternate forms of aword, and restrict the search to certain types of text (e.g., &quot;text field&quot; or&quot;section title&quot;).andP;  When the list of &quot;hits&quot; is displayed, clicking on adocument's name brings up a list of subsections where matches were found;clicking on a subsection shows the type of text in which each match occurred.andM;Distribution.andP;  Not every company will need to distribute this informationbeyond its own network.andP;  Those that do will benefit from Context's assistancein producing CD-ROMs.andM;Software from the CD-ROM Developer's Kit enables users to transfer documentlibraries from Winchester disks to 9-track tape in a format acceptable byCD-ROM mastering houses.andP;  The kit also includes a CD-ROM drive, software toreview the finished product, and documentation for novice CD-ROM producers.andM;Documents can also be distributed on other media.andP;  Distributed documents areaccompanied by copies of the Browser.andM;Schedules and prices.andP;  We saw an alpha version of BOLD; some features had notyet been added.andP;  Context plans to distribute beta software in May and torelease the product later this year.andP;  The first release will run on anyApollo workstation; the second will support the Sun Sparcstation line.andM;According to Context, the BOLD Composer will cost $5,000, with each inputformat (TIFF, PostScript, etc.) an additional $1,000.andP;  The Brower, sold on afloating-license basis, will cost less than $1,000.andP;  Document distributorswill send Brower licenses to the end users; they will cost the distributorsaround $50 each in lots of 1,000.andP;  The CD-ROM Developer's Kit will be in the$5,000 range.andM;Datalogics: SGML as database applicationandM;Datalogics gave a practical demonstration of how commercial airlines mightmove from page-based documentation into database publishing.andP;  The project waswork instruction cards--the set of instructions that must be assembled beforea maintenance person begins fixing something onan aircraft.andM;Currently, commercial airlines compile these cards from the &quot;owner's manual&quot;they receive in looseleaf form from their contractor.andP;  To create the cards,many cut and paste sections from the manual onto new pages that make up theinstruction sheet.andP;  Even worse is the process of customizing the manualitself to the airline's in-house style.andP;  For that to be done, the airlinemust either cut and paste material onto the existing pages or createreplacement pages from scratch.andP;  The process is woefully inefficient:Datalogics described how one airline has 250 engineers making such cards wihtPageMaker running at every desk; another uses a minicomputer-based wordprocessor to create patches that are spliced in with text and graphicssupplied by the vendor.andM;But the worst part is not creating the new pages the first time, it isfinding all of the pages that are affected by subsequent revisions to theoriginal looseleaf pages supplied by the contractor.andP;  How, using PageMaker ora word processor, can you keep track of all of the parts that are referencedthroughout hundreds of thousands of pages?andP;  The answer, for most airlines, isby hand, not by computer.andM;In the Datalogics scenario, the contractor delivers the documentation as SGMLtext files that reference computer graphics and images.andP;  The individualinstructions are carefully tagged with generic identifiers and attributes.andO;These would be read by the Datalogics system at the airline and used toconstruct a database of relations.andP;  This database would then be used not onlyto construct the job instruction cards but also to locate all of the cards(and manual pages) that are affected by changes to the source data.andM;The Datalogics demonstration is a good example of how SGML may be applied toa database application rather than a linear text file.andP;  It also illustrateshow SGML may be used both for exchanging information and manipulating it, sothat the manufacturer supplies to the customer information that is malleableinstead of static.andM;DEC: fonts, retrieval, hypertext linksandM;Digital has been more aggressive than any other platform vendor in addingdistributed publishing capabilities as system resources.andP;  It began bydeveloping a compound document architecture and interchange format, thenfollowed with several applications that proved that the architecture worked.andO;Since then it has added such enhancements as network printing facilities andnetwork SQL services.andM;At the Seminars, DEC unveiled its latest move--fonts as a systemresource--and in its exhibit demonstrated protoypes of two other servicesthat might be offered in the future: full-text retrieval and hypertext links.andM;We covered DEC's font strategy as part of the font coverage in our previousissue.andP;  Rather than commit to any one font technology, DEC is developing astrategy for offering any type of fonts as a network resource.andP;  This approachwould greatly simplify both management and distribution of fonts for systemadministrators and relieve end users of the burden of worrying about whatfonts are available for screen display and printing.andM;A key component of Digital's strategy is active participation in thedevelopment of vendor-independent font standrds.andP;  Currently, the font aspectof document interchange through Digital's interchange format (DDIF) is nothandled in a system-independent fashion.andP;  But as ODA and DSSSL areimplemented by DEC and its customers, DEC sees a vendor-independent method ofdescribing fonts as crucial to meaningful exchange of formatting information.andO;The ISO font standard (which we wrote about in the Seybold Report on DesktopPublishing, Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  6) is now partially in draft form, and DEC isactively planning system products that will make use of it.andM;DEC is the only platform vendor to date that is looking at the changes to itsown internal publishing needs and is building commercial products thatreflect such changes.andP;  As a large company, DEC's own publishing needs areconsiderable.andP;  But because it is a large-system supplier, its strategy isbased at the network rather than the platform level.andM;As an example, DEC is finding that distributing documentation on CD-ROM isnot enough to bring end users into the world of digital reference materials.andO;Many customers would balk at the suggestion that each user have a CD-ROMdrive attached to his or her workstation.andP;  DEC's approach is to supportdifferent types of libraries across the network.andP;  Networked CD-ROM drives(with a librarian or automatic jukebox) would be one type of repository amongseveral types of library choices available.andM;Looking ahead, the problem with networked CD-ROM drives is that eachdocumentation supplier has its own retrieval package for accessing theinformation off the disc.andP;  A large customer that wants to put an entirelibrary of reference manuals into one repository that is accessible acrossthe network needs a consistent method of retrieval.andM;DEC has not made any product announcements, but its technology demonstrationof a network-based retrieval system is a step in this direction.andP;  It wasshown as a network resource accessible to third-party developers through astandard set of DECwindows system calls.andP;  The developer could add retrievalfacilities to its own application simply by adding menus that activate thesystem resource.andP;  This method reduces the overhead for the developers, and itgives end users a consistent interface for retrieving documents across avariety of applications.andM;The demonstration of hypertext links was similar in approach.andP;  Here, the ideais that users might want to establish links between a variety of differentfile types.andP;  (DEC showed links between its electronic mail and calendarprograms.)andP;  The hypertext links are pointers kept outside of the filesthemselves in a system-wide database.andP;  DEC provides the programming interfacefor developers to add hypertext to their programs; the end user get aconsistent interface to a function that is available in a variety ofapplications.andM;Unlike fonts, retrieval and hypertext technologies are not standardized.andP;  Astandard committee has been formed to develop a method of describinghypertext links, but it will be a while before this effort results in anindustry consensus.andP;  In the meantime, DEC is forging ahead with acommon-sense approach: participate in the standards process to influence andkeep abreast of industry developments, and develop system products that offerusers the technology as soon as possible without sacrificing futurecompatibility.andM;DEC's approach is appealing from a development point of view.andP;  Where thecompany has suffered in the publishing market is in servicing customerneeds--the right technology is only one part of keeping satisfied customers.andO;If DEC shores up this weakness, it could quickly become the preferred vendorof network-based publishing systems.andM;Frame shows Motif on SparcstationandM;Frame demonstrated an OSF/Motif version of FrameMaker 2.0 running,ironically, on a Sparcstation.andP;  Motif is based on X Window, so this versionof FrameMaker is essentially a user-interface change for Frame, which alreadylicenses FrameMaker on X for more than a dozen different computers.andM;The Motif version was announced for HP 9000 Series, all Apollo and IBM Series6000 workstations.andP;  The HP and Apollo versions will be available from Framethis summer; the IBM version is slated for fall release.andP;  Frame reports thatmost of its OEM partners have also committed to porting FrameMaker 2.0-XMotif to their platforms in 1990.andM;Currently, Frame is shipping FrameMaker 2.0 for the Next cube and SunandSolbourne workstations (under SunView).andP;  The price for all 2.0 versions is$2,500.andM;Interleaf unveils 'active documents'andM;For several years now, Interleaf has used the March Seminars to launch newproducts and major releases.andP;  Often the finished products appeared much laterthan the initial showcasing.andP;  But Interleaf has always come to the Seminarswith significant features and new capabilities that have been a challenge forthose trying to comprehend the fullness of its system.andP;  This year was nodifferent.andM;Active documents.andP;  This year Interleaf introduced a new concept rather thanjust another feature set.andP;  It calls the new concept &quot;active documents.&quot;andP;  Inpractice, we found that the new concept indeed does add newcapabilities--especially for Interleaf and its third-party softwaredevelopers--that will make it much easier for them to customize the basic TPSsystem for specific applications and highly customized requirements.andP;  We'llreturn to this point in a moment.andM;The best way we can describe Interleaf's active documents is to compare themto the conventional Interleaf capabilities to which we are accustomed.andP;  Withthe robust feature set of TPS 4.0, a user can perform endless manipulationsto a document, changing its content as well as well as its appearance.andP;  Thereare few composition tasks a user can't do.andP;  However, the key here is the factthat for all changes (except for automatic routines like creating tables ofcontents and indexes), the user commands the system to make each change oraddition to the document.andP;  All changes are specifically made by the user withthe aid of a powerful feature set.andM;A year ago, Interleaf introduced support for the Lisp programming language,which made it possible to automate repetitive tasks and assign them to anicon on the Interleaf desktop.andP;  Such macro routines (LeafScripts in Interleaflingo) execute a stored sequence of commands.andP;  With active documents,Interleaf has made it possible to add LEafScripts within a document asattributes of document components, rather than just a external batch files.andM;With active documents, the system (not the user) can make additions andchanges to the document.andP;  How does the system know what to change and how todo it?andP;  That's a more difficult question, and it changes from appliction toapplication.andP;  But the key added ingredient is the capability to program thesystem to recognize various conditions in the document, make decisions basedon these conditions, and make appropriate changes to the document as aresult.andM;In this way, an active document is one that makes changes to itself, withoutneeding direct input from the user.andP;  In the extreme case, entire documentscould be completely created--automatically, by themselves--based oninformation and conditions within the system.andM;The benefits.andP;  Active documents provide a two-fold benefit.andP;  For the user,they offer the potential of highly customized publishing software.andP;  Forexample, they might be used to construct a smart document editor that workedwithin the constraints of a user's application, prompting the user on whereto go next.andP;  They might also be used to steer users toward information thatis critical to them but not to everyone else, such as by generating,formatting and printing every Thursday a specific sales report frominformation in several databases.andM;For Interleaf, the active document concept solves the dilemma betweenproviding a basic feature set that is not too complicated to use andproviding a publishing product that is tailored to very specific customerrequirements.andP;  The demonstration showed a sophisticated toolset with whichInterleaf can more easily build custom systems while leaving the basicfeatures and functionality of TPS intact.andM;A new concept is always more difficult to understand fully than a well-definedfeature that is readily demosntrable.andP;  The best way we could describeInterleaf's active documents is to offer specific examples.andP;  But the readershoudl understand that the system's new expertise is a very generalcapability, not limited to those examples we describe here.andM;Applications.andP;  With active documents, the Interleaf document can be&quot;programmed&quot; (in the broadest sense) to perform a variety of tasks--senddocuments to various users, send only specific parts of documents to certainusers, create a new document or customize the presentation to specific usersso that only the portions of a document they &quot;need to know&quot; are distributedto them.andM;Other conditions, such as recognizing that fields in a table have beenfilled, can result in the system totaling columns and/or rows of numbers andinserting the results of the computation.andP;  This may sound like little morethan adding spreadsheet capability to a document, but it demonstrates theadded intelligence of the document--especially when the numbers are filled infrom another database.andP;  The active process in this case is performing mathand inserting results.andM;To minimize mistakes in database publishing, the active document process maybe used to guide the user to enter data into fields of a document (or forme.andO;With a &quot;live link&quot; capability, data can be inserted automatically from adatabase--assuring the latest version of the data.andP;  The active nature of thedocument can be used to validate fields, decide what new fields have to befilled in (based on previously supplied data) and in general help the userstep through the process.andP;  The new data filled into the form can be extractedautomatically to create other forms, charts and documents.andM;Workflow management becomes part of the active document realm.andP;  Documents canhave a specified workflow associated with them.andP;  They know that they have tobe routed to user ABC when task XYZ is complete.andP;  This process may be morecomplex, because portions of documents can be routed to different peoplebased on a preset routing scheme.andP;  The system can also track all of theseprocesses to better manage the overall document creation and distributionprocess.andM;This concept also could be used to set up a security system.andP;  Certain userscould be limited to specific functions and, more important, restricted tospecific portions of documents.andM;Amoco's example.andP;  As we mentione above, Interleaf will be using thiscapability to customize its standard product for customers.andP;  At the Seminars,it demonstrated a system developed for Amoco.andM;A programmer was sent to Amoco to set up a database and formgenerationpackage using Interleaf's TPS software.andP;  Using the new activedocument capabilities, the system was set up in a matter of weeks, sittingside by side with the users and customizing the document generation packageto their specific needs.andP;  Interleaf says this is typical of how it will usethe capability (in the hands of applications people and programmers).andM;In this application a user was guided by the system to fill in information ina custom-designed form.andP;  Some of the information was already supplied from aCD-ROm database.andP;  Other data was entered at the keyboard by the user--guidedby the system prompts.andP;  As fields were completed, the system validated theinput (for example, checking to see that the value fell within the allowednumerical range), made decisions on other fields that required data input andinstructed the user in the type of data to be supplied.andP;  Hypertext links wereused to supply other required data.andM;Who makes the document active?andP;  The Amoco example is only one of thousandsthat could be built using the new active document capability.andP;  The questionis: who will have the expertise to use it?andP;  We could be proved wrong, butfrom the demonstration, it appeared that this facility is really geared forprogrammers.andP;  In other words, this is not a feature or function we expect tosee average users playing with.andP;  We believe it provides a powerful set oftools and a new capability that will allow Interleaf to quickly and easilybroaded its application base.andP;  But in its present incarnation (and what wesaw was only a demo of technology still half a year away), it is not sointuitive that average users will take it and build their own customized TPS.andM;Interleaf hasn't exactly appeared eager to customize its software for themany varying vertical niches within the corporate publishing market.andP;  Thismay frustrate some users, but it may in the long run have been the bestdecision--over-customizing has ruined many good products and companies.andM;The new capability changes all that.andP;  We now envision Interleaf picking a fewnew application areas (such as Yellow Pages make-up), using the activedocument concept to quickly create a product that better addresses the uniquerequirements of a database application.andP;  The challenge will be to control theamount of customizing without disturbing the basic product.andP;  Furthermore, itwill be a challenge to keep this many customized versions updated as newfeatures are made available in the standard product.andM;If Interleaf meets these challenges, our hats are off to it.andP;  We look forwardto reviewing the product when it is made available in the fourth quarter ofthis year.andM;Verity readies real-time retrievalandM;When describing Verity's Topic full-text retrieval system in our report fromlast year's Seybold Seminars (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andP;  14, p. 24), we wrote that it&quot;could be used to monitor incoming data from newswires and similar sources.&quot;andO;This year, Verity told us that such an application is nearly complete.andM;Topic retrievs text in a more sophisticated way than by simple word-matchingor boolean operations.andP;  The user constructs &quot;topics&quot;--collections ofconnected, weighted branches containing words and subjects that are relatedto each other.andP;  The program can then compile a list of files that match thesearch criteria built into a topic, in order of how relevant they are likelyto be (i.e., how many single or boolean-related words from a topic were foundin each, and how heavily those words were weighted in the topic).andM;We were shown a simulation of how Topic will operate on a real-time feed fromDow Jones.andP;  The user can construct a topic, then set a relevance threshold.andO;When Topic receives a file from the newswire that exceeds that threshold, ittakes a predefined action: marks the slug, notifes the recipient by displayor sound, runs a program, or whatever.andP;  &quot;Knowledge bases&quot; will be availablethat contain concept trees for areas such as companies (e.g., the Fortune500) or financial terms (e.g., terms related to mergers and acquisitions).andM;Verity says that the real-time version of Topic will be released in April orMay.andP;  An entry-level system will likely be priced in the low five-figurerange.andP;  Dow Jones's information will be offered separately, on a per-monthbasis rather than a per-usage one.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
