The data flowdiagrams and data dictionaries of structured analysis were the primarytools used in development of an ideal model of the DO software system.These and the structure charts developed during the design phase formthe basic documentation of the system. Real-time structured developmenttechniques, e.g., state transition diagrams, are employed to describecontrol functions in some areas, e.g. in the calibration software. TheSA/SD methodology has proven to be valuable in the formulation of ideasand in communication between software developers. The methodology andits application to D0 software are described and the benefits and problemsare assessed. Problems finding adequate software tools for the VAX environmentare discussed and a data dictionary manager developed by D0 using DECRDB is described. 4 references, 6 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
