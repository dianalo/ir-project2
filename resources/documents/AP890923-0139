A peacekeeping force of 100 observers had initially beenscheduled to arrive in October, but Azcona said at a pressconference that a larger force had been agreed upon.   He said members will patrol border areas of El Salvador,Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Guatemala.   He also said that the demobilization, repatriation andresettlement of Contra guerrillas fighting Nicaragua's leftistgovernment ``is progressing.''   ``Central America is about to enter into a stage of truedemocracy,'' Azcona said. He said, ``The Contras must acceptdemobilization because they haven't got the resources to doanything else.''   The U.S.-supported Contras have been based in the hills ofeastern Honduras near the border with Nicaragua since 1981. Formost of that time, they operated with Honduran knowledge andconsent, but Azcona and President Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua signedan agreement Aug. 7 calling for disbanding the Contras by Dec. 8.   Most of the Contras retreated to Yamales, along the border withNicaragua, in March 1988 when the United States cut off weaponsaid. However, U.S. support at the latest count was still feeding12,000 fighters and 42,000 relatives.   While some Contras have deserted, others have marched back intoNicaragua with their weapons to await the outcome of Nicaraguanelections scheduled for February. Both the Sandinista governmentand the Contras have said they will refrain from ``offensiveoperations.''   The Aug. 7 agreement, also signed by Guatemala, El Salvador andCosta Rica, called for 100 observers from West Germany, Spain andCanada to monitor the accords.   Azcona said the larger U.N. peace force will be made up ofmilitary personnel and civilians based in all five countries. Hesaid they will patrol border areas to discourage armed guerrillaincursions.   He gave no date for their arrival.   Nicaragua has accused Honduras and Costa Rica of harboring theContras, while El Salvador has accused Nicaragua of supporting andarming Salvadoran leftist guerrillas.   Teams from the United Nations and the Organization of AmericanStates, as well as other international observers, have beenvisiting Central American nations in preparation for disbanding theContras and holding the Nicaraguan elections.</TEXT></DOC>
