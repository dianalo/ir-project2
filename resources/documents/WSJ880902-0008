Bass Group Inc. about acquiring American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's largest insolvent thrift.    The Bank Board's agreement to negotiate exclusively with Bass Group was scheduled to expire yesterday. The Bank Board's chairman, M. Danny Wall, issued a brief statement late yesterday indicating that the negotiations with Bass Group were continuing, and that the Bank Board &quot;would delay any further announcement for 24 hours.&quot;    &quot;The concentration of effort in these negotiations has been exceeded only by the earlier months of discussion with Ford,&quot; Mr. Wall said in his statement, referring to the negotiations with First Nationwide Bank, the big thrift unit of Ford Motor Co., to acquire American Savings.    Mr. Wall's reference to the talks with First Nationwide, which lasted nearly a year before ending last April, apparently was intended to address recent congressional criticism of the Bank Board's exclusive negotiating arrangement with Bass Group, and of certain reported terms of the Bass proposal to acquire American Savings.    American Savings, the main unit of Financial Corp. of America, Irvine, Calif., has been the Bank Board's largest single headache for more than four years. To complete the acquisition by Bass Group, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is expected to provide at least $2 billion in assistance. Bass Group, of Fort Worth, Texas, would inject about $550 million in new capital and provide the FSLIC with warrants representing a 30% interest in certain units of a new company it would establish to own American Savings.    Negotiators for the Bank Board and Bass Group continued their talks in Washington late last night, according to officials familiar with the situation. Representatives of the two sides met several times yesterday morning and afternoon, after reaching agreement on a number of points during a four-hour negotiating session Wednesday night, said the officials -- who declined to be identified.    Even if the Bank Board and Bass Group are able to agree on all terms of the transaction, it could take as long as several weeks to close the deal. The Internal Revenue Service must approve various tax aspects of the acquisition, and the California savings and loan commissioner must approve an application by Bass Group for a state thrift charter.    Criticism of the Bank Board's handling of the talks with Bass Group has come largely from Rep. Fernard St Germain (D., R.I.), chairman of the House Banking Committee, and Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr. a Michigan Democrat, who is expected to become chairman of the Senate banking Committee next year.    Sen. Riegle has raised questions about the Bass Group's proposal to set up a merchant banking operation that could invest $1.5 billion of funds from American Savings in transactions such as leveraged buyouts. Bass Group has been involved in several, large leveraged buy-out transactions in recent years. In a leveraged buy-out, a company is acquired largely through the use of debt which is repaid from the company's cash flow or asset sales.    If Bass Group reaches an agreement with the Bank Board, it will mark a defeat for the intense, last-minute lobbying campaign that First Nationwide has waged on Capitol Hill. The Ford thrift's apparent objective was to convince the Bank Board to end its exclusive negotiating agreement with Bass Group and resume talks with Ford.    After the Bank Board's announcement yesterday, Robert E. Lackovic, president of First Nationwide, said that his company's earlier negotiations with the Bank Board were &quot;extensive and intensive, but they weren't exclusive, and that's the point.&quot;    Roger Martin, the Bank Board member who has headed the board's efforts to resolve American Savings' troubles, said last night, &quot;The reason we gave the Bass people exclusive negotiations is that the Bass people had a much better bid, plus the fact that the Ford Motor Co. walked out on two previous occasions.&quot;    A Bass Group spokesman declined comment. </TEXT></DOC>
