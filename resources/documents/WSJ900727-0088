The ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries remained at odds, however, over just how far thoseprices should rise. Most seek an eventual boost of about $2 abarrel but others are aiming for much more. Late last night,they held informal talks aimed at resolving thosedifferences. They'll resume their formal conference today.</LP><TEXT>   Before the meeting started this week, Iraq had movedtroops onto Kuwait's border and angrily alleged it was beingdamaged by low oil prices brought on by excessive Kuwaitiouput. Yesterday, however, Baghdad scaled back its weeklongintimidation campaign, and leaders of the two nations arescheduled to meet this weekend in Saudi Arabia.   A majority of the OPEC ministers are supporting a newtotal production ceiling of 22.5 million barrels a day forthe remainder of the year. While 400,000 barrels a day aboveOPEC's current ceiling, that ceiling would be well below theorganization's actual output most of this year because theold ceiling was routinely exceeded.   Among the attractions of the new ceiling proposal are apledge by Kuwait to adhere to its official quota from now on,and what amounts to a return to the OPEC fold by the UnitedArab Emirates, which would get a new quota. Previously, theUAE all but ignored its quota.   If all members honor a 22.5-million-barrel ceiling, thesupply of OPEC oil on world markets would shrink and priceswould rise as current excess inventories are worked off.Continued output at that new ceiling also should strengthenprices more later in the year because oil demand increases inthe fall and winter.   The problem for ministers has become the setting of a new&quot;reference&quot;, or target, price for OPEC oil. For the past fouryears, OPEC has had an official reference price of $18 abarrel, averaged over its various grades of crude. But thathas been rarely sustained because chronic quota &quot;cheating&quot; bysome members has created excess supply. Even after a recentquick run-up from the year's low of $14, OPEC oil pricesstill are shy of $18 a barrel.   Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and president ofOPEC, justifying the call for a higher figure, estimated theold reference price would be $22.70 a barrel today ifadjusted into current dollars. A majority of the 13 OPECnations consider an increase of $2 a barrel realistic, but anincrease of $7 a barrel has been demanded by President SaddamHussein of Iraq.   &quot;We are arguing very hard&quot; on the pricing issue, saidGholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister who has beenleading the push for an increase of $2 a barrel in the $18reference price.   OPEC's reference price is largely symbolic; a goal ithopes to achieve in the open market through manipulation ofits production, rather than through a set selling price.Nonetheless, the reference price has emerged as thecenterpiece of the campaign started in February by the Iraqipresident against Kuwait and the UAE for what he claimed wastheir &quot;economic warfare&quot; against Iraq.   That confrontation grew rapidly, with Kuwait becoming thechief target. It climaxed with last week's troop and tankmovements and this week's demand here by Iraqi oil ministerIssam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi for an increase in OPEC'sreference price to $25 a barrel.   So far, that figure has been supported only by Libya.Although it is understood Mr. Al-Chalabi would needgovernment permission to change his stance, some ministersattempted to negotiate a figure of $21 or $22. But they raninto an unexpected obstacle. &quot;There is a stalemate,&quot; saidone. &quot;One group {believed to be led by Venezuela} won't goabove $20.&quot;   While Iraq isn't likely to prevail in its bold bid to pushthe OPEC reference price all the way to $25, several oilministers conceded the attempt has at least revived waningdiscipline within the organization.   &quot;It's a whole new ballgame,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita,Indonesia's oil minister, said in an interview. &quot;There aretwo countries that can take the credit.&quot; He named SaudiArabia &quot;for its courage in cutting production last May to setthe pace&quot; and Iraq &quot;for its determination to restore quotadiscipline.&quot;   Separately, as expected, Ramzi Salman, Iraq'soil-marketing director, was named to fill the vacant post ofdeputy secretary-general of OPEC.</TEXT></DOC>
