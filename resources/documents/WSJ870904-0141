Business executives say that manufacturing and raw-materials orders slowed considerably this week. Volume on the stock market was down about 25% from two months ago.    This slowdown &quot;emphasizes the fact that the recovery is based on psychology, rather than hard-resource availability,&quot; says a leading Philippine banker. The business community is concerned that the battle for political control between rival factions isn't over. Until that sense of insecurity is removed, many company executives say they will postpone investments.    The army has yet to flush out all the rebels. Gregorio Honasan, the leader of the coup attempt, escaped, and his whereabouts aren't known. Yesterday, some Moslem rebels threw their support behind the mutiny.    The watch is now on to see whether President Corazon Aquino can continue to control a nation that in a single week was battered not only by the coup but by a strike by militant unions that crippled much of Manila.    &quot;The general consensus of the business community is that Mrs. Aquino must take a firmer stand. She must reassess her government,&quot; says Raul Concepcion, president of Concepcion Industries Inc., a maker of air conditioners. Mrs. Aquino took office in February 1986 after a popular uprising overthrew the 20-year-old regime of Ferdinand Marcos.    Most immediately, last week's coup attempt is proving another blow to an already-battered tourism industry. Several hotels report heavy cancellations. A spokesman for the businessman-oriented Manila Intercontinental Hotel says cancellations are running about 20%.    Investor confidence has lagged despite government predictions that the country's gross national product -- its output of goods and services -- will grow almost 6% this year, faster than an expansion of 1.1% in 1986 and in contrast to contractions in 1984 and 1985.    Economists say the growth is led in part by a rise in prices for coconuts, an important export. A previous marketing monopoly, run by associates of Mr. Marcos, and a ban on private-sector exports were lifted by Mrs. Aquino's government, putting more money in farmers' pockets.    Consumer spending is increasing and fueling the economy. According to industry figures released this week, auto sales rose 53% in the first half from a year earlier, sales of construction materials gained 54% and sales of consumer durables increased 70%.    But many local manufacturers have filled the new-found demand for consumer products with old machinery. Decisions to expand or modernize production are another matter. &quot;The recovery is taking advantage of existing capacity,&quot; says Mr. Concepcion, the air-conditioner manufacturer. &quot;Businesses have yet to put down new foundations.&quot;    In its early days, Mrs. Aquino's government was lauded by the business community for such actions as the dismantling of agricultural monopolies, the easing of import restrictions and the elimination of some taxes. But even before the latest coup attempt, the government had come under criticism for what is perceived to be a growing lack of economic direction. Government officials openly bicker about economic policy.    Executives and bankers note that after making the denationalization of state companies a major plank in its economic platform, the government has backtracked on the sale of such substantial assets as Philippine National Oil Co. Court injunctions obtained by disgruntled parties are a favorite tool to hold up sales that have been approved.    The government has wavered on land reform, and it appears that a proposed land-reform plan could be held up indefinitely by congressional debate, leaving both farmers and rural banks in limbo.    The government also has wavered on its attitude toward increasingly militant labor unions. Last week's strike -- the biggest labor protest against the Aquino government -- was called to protest an increase in oil prices. Despite a last-minute partial price rollback by the government, the strike took place.    Economic analysts maintain that until domestic investors' fears are overcome, foreign investors will remain cautious as well. &quot;Foreigners take their lead from domestic investors,&quot; a foreign-securities analyst says.    Next week is a test. On Tuesday, the government will auction a 53% stake in Philippine Commercial International Bank. At least two foreign concerns -- First Pacific Group of Hong Kong and Banque Nationale de Paris of France -- have expressed interest. </TEXT></DOC>
