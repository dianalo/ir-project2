SEARLES</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DECKERS, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A riverside community that would be floodedfor a Denver reservoir if plans go ahead for a 615-foot-high damreacted with disbelief when an Environmental Protection Agencyreview blasted the project.   ``I kind of halfway sat there stunned,'' said Fannie Roth, 70,who has been battling the Two Forks project for 17 years.   ``I was hoping it was true _ it numbed me that it really, reallywas not going to be built,'' Roth said in an interview in the homeshe built among the pines above the South Fork of the South PlatteRiver.   If Two Forks were built, her home ``would be under approximately300 feet of water _ if they ever had the water to fill it,'' Rothsaid.   Lee DeHihns, an EPA deputy regional administrator from Atlantawho was assigned to review the project, announced Aug. 29 that theagency would press on with a veto process begun last March by EPAadministrator William Reilly. A two-month public hearing period isthe next step, followed by a final decision by EPA administrators inWashington, D.C.   DeHihns said his five-month review concluded that the Denvermetropolitan area's future water needs did not warrant theenvironmental toll of the proposed $500 million to $1 billionproject.   The dam would be located 25 miles southwest of Denver near theconfluence of the South Platte River and its North Fork. Besidesflooding Deckers, the project would inundate scenic canyon lands and30 miles of stream known for prized trout, and it would damagewildlife habitat in Nebraska, the EPA said.   Deckers, a community of 180 people, lies 50 miles southwest ofDenver over winding country roads. Visitors who brave a 10-milestretch of narrow, teeth-chattering washboard road with second-gearhairpin turns, steep grades and washouts are mostly attracted by theSouth Fork's legendary trout fishing.   After the Denver Water Board and 42 metropolitan-area waterproviders proposed the dam, many homeowners panicked and sold theirproperty to the board, diminishing the community's tax resources forroad maintenance and law enforcement. Also, residents found theirtelephone service was not updated over the years, because it wasassumed the entire exchange would be flooded.   ``The people that are still landowners here, you can restassured, didn't want the dam. I worked a lifetime for what I ownhere. I want to continue living here until I die,'' said Roth, whomoved to Deckers in 1953 after retiring as a Denver Public Schoolsbus driver and stays busy with carpentry, bowling and pitchinghorseshoes.   She and her neighbors say they will attempt to obtain protectionfor the South Platte under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act with thehelp of the Washington-based American Rivers organization.   ``I'm glad the EPA said no,'' said Shirley Childs, a clerk at theDeckers general store and a 25-year resident of the area. ``I'llpray to God they continue saying no.''   The veto decision came as a relief to Al Barnes, who has beenvisiting or living in the area for 35 years.   His wife, Mary, said the EPA is ``finally going to look at thingslike this _ and protect some of this country.   ``We are elated the EPA stuck to its guns,'' Mrs. Barnes said.``Number one, this is our home, the thing I went through severalwars for and the dream of a home in the mountains _ so my greatgrandchildren can come up here and enjoy the clean air and the waterand the wildlife.''   The Barnes' home, looking across the South Fork at Long ScraggyPeak, was a three-room cabin that they added a second floor to whenhe retired from the Air Force missile development program six yearsago.   Despite the long battle with the Denver Water Board to stop TwoForks, Roth and the Barnes said the conflict has been amicable inrecent years.   ``The Big Stick time was in the '60s, when it was `We're theDenver Water Board and by God ...''' Barnes recalled.   ``But the new water board has been in the '80s, since Mayor(Federico) Pena came to office. Since then, the whole context of thewater board has mellowed down,'' said Mrs. Barnes.</TEXT></DOC>
