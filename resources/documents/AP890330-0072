Alberto Cantero, former head of the political section of theinvestigations department of the Asuncion police, was suspendedTuesday so he could ``prepare his defense before superiors andperhaps before a judge,'' said Osvaldo Palacios, a police spokesman.   Human rights groups have accused Cantero of directing thetorture of scores of political dissidents and others prior to aFeb. 3 coup that ousted Stroessner, an army general who ruledParaguay nearly 35 years.   Gen. Andres Rodriguez led the coup and is president.   ``This should have happened immediately after the coup, not onlywith Cantero but with other torturers that remain at their jobs,''said Francisco de Vargas, a human rights attorney for the Committeeof Churches.   The attorney said at least 50 people said Cantero was one ofthose who ordered abuses ranging from beating, whipping, repeateddunking in a tub of dirty water and electric shocks. He saidanother 12 known torturers remain at their jobs in Asuncion and inthe interior of the country.   Cantero was replaced by Obdulio Arguello Britez, said Palacios.   Two other police officers, Augusto Caceres Spelt and CamiloAlmada Saprisa, also accused of torture under the Stroessnerregime, were suspended two weeks ago. Both were subordinates ofCantero.   De Vargas said no action has been taken on criminal court suitsfiled against Cantero and other police officials March 17 by 42alleged torture victims.   ``This means the justice system is the same one that existedunder the Stroessner regime,'' said de Vargas. ``We have given themtoo many days to act and they have yet to issue one arrest order,''he added.   During a meeting with human rights lawyers earlier this month,Attorney General Diogenes Martinez pledged to follow up onaccusations made by those who claim to have been tortured andpunish the guilty.</TEXT></DOC>
