Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D.,Okla.) said the panel will decide today whether to delay thehearings, currently set for next week, to &quot;consider&quot;information being provided to a special prosecutor by formerCIA official Alan Fiers. At a closed-door meeting yesterday,some committee members argued for a delay to weigh whateverMr. Fiers has to say about the spy agency's role in thescandal while Mr. Gates was the CIA's second-in-command.</LP><TEXT>   People familiar with the committee deliberations stressedthat a delay isn't certain and that the panel doesn't knowwhat Mr. Fiers has to say, if anything, about Mr. Gates. Buta lengthy delay could only harm Mr. Gates's chances forconfirmation, because the main issue on the senators' mindswill be his claim that he knew little or nothing about theillegal diversion of Iran arms-sales proceeds to Nicaraguanrebels.   If the hearings are delayed, it could take weeks for thesenators to arrange to receive testimony or other informationfrom Mr. Fiers. And it may be necessary to question ClairGeorge, Mr. Fiers's superior, who Mr. Fiers has suggestedknew about the diversion.   Unlike Mr. Fiers, who has pleaded guilty to twomisdemeanor charges in connection with the Iran-Contraaffair, Mr. George may still be under investigation and maybe reluctant to talk. In addition, special prosecutorLawrence Walsh may be reluctant to let Mr. Fiers testifybefore the committee for fear that public testimony coulddamage any future prosecutions.</TEXT></DOC>
