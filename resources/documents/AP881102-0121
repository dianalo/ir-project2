The ghostly image of the Democratic presidential nominee as abig-spending liberal is giving MacKay the shivers and stirringMack's hopes of squeaking through to an election victory nextTuesday in one of the most closely fought Senate battles in thenation.   The tightness of the race to succeed popular Democratic Sen.Lawton Chiles, who is retiring after three terms, could test thestrength of Republican presidential nominee George Bush's coattails.   Recent polls give the vice president a double-digit lead overDukakis among Florida voters _ up to 27 percentage points in onesurvey _ but indicate that the contest between Mack and MacKay, bothof them six-year House veterans, is too close to call.   Although Democrats have a 3-to-2 edge among registered voters,ticket-splitting is a recent phenomenon in Florida, and the Mackcampaign has been trying to gain a boost from Bush's popularity.   One TV ad shows Bush urging Floridians to send Mack to the Senateto help him as president. Another features a film clip of the vicepresident telling the GOP National Convention to ``read my lips _ nonew taxes.''   A third commercial says Dukakis and MacKay stand together ondefense issues and opposing aid for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,and concludes: ``Hey Buddy and Mike, You're Liberal.''   Mack says he represents the same Florida conservatives who gaveRonald Reagan lopsided victories in 1980 and 1984, and boasts thathe will be able to pick up the telephone and talk personally to thepresident if Bush is elected.   MacKay responds by embracing vice presidential nominee Bentsen,the moderate Texas senator, and keeping Dukakis at arm's length.   He tells crime-conscious Floridians that he supports the deathpenalty for drug-related murders. Dukakis opposes capital punishment.   Like Dukakis, MacKay says he opposes the B-1 bomber and otherdefense programs he regards as costly boondoggles but favors astrong military. He says he would consider higher taxes only on suchexcise levies as cigarettes and liquor.   He calls himself a Southern moderate-to-conservative in the moldof Chiles and Sens. Albert Gore of Tennessee, Sam Nunn of Georgiaand Bob Graham of Florida, all of whom have campaigned for MacKay.   Graham warns Floridians that they will lose clout in the Senateif they elect ``an ideological wacko'' like Mack.   Mack, 48, repeats the mantra of ``less taxes, less government,less spending _ more freedom'' at every opportunity. MacKay chargesthat his opponent votes ``a bizarre ideological agenda that isanti-Florida'' and offensive to environmentalists and the elderly.   The two candidates entered Congress together in 1982 withdramatically different styles, philosophies and backgrounds.   MacKay, 55, whose country boy look belies his affluence as theson of a Central Florida land-owning family, spent 12 years in thestate Legislature and lost a 1980 bid for the Democratic Senatenomination. One of the most highly respected politicians in Floridafor years, he was heartily endorsed this year by nearly all thestate's daily newspapers.   MacKay was preparing for a 1990 bid for the governorship whenformer two-term Gov. Reubin Askew declared himself fed up with thetime required for fund raising and on May 7 dropped out of a Senaterace that was considered his.   MacKay, relying on a dedicated cadre of volunteers, came frombehind to gain a runoff election against state InsuranceCommissioner Bill Gunter, whom MacKay defeated for the Democraticnomination on Oct. 4.   Connie Mack bears the name of his grandfather, the famed managerof the Philadelphia Athletics baseball team who adopted a nicknamein place of his real name, Cornelius McGillicuddy.   The placid, telegenic Mack was born in Philadelphia and moved toFlorida with his family in 1951. He became a bank president in thesmall southwest Gulf Coast town of Cape Coral. Like Reagan, Macksays he is a former liberal Democrat whose views evolved into GOPconservatism. He says it was Reagan's 1980 election that inspiredhim to enter politics.   He won in 1982 and was easily re-elected twice. In the House, heis a member of the Republican band of young conservative activistsled by Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia. When national GOP leadersurged him to challenge Chiles, Mack left Rep. Jack Kemp'spresidential campaign team to enter the Senate race in October 1987.   Although MacKay has a moderate record, he's undoubtedly tooliberal for Mack, who has one of the most conservative records inCongress. Mack has been host of fund-raising appearances by Reaganand Iran-Contra figure Oliver North.   He refused to debate his primary opponent, former U.S. AttorneyRobert Merkle, who carried a life-size cutout called ``CardboardConnie'' and derided his foe as an intellectual lightweight.   When Mack won the primary with 62 percent of the vote, Merkledidn't endorse him but promised only that he wouldn't oppose him.Meanwhile, Gunter eased Democratic fears of a divided party bycampaigning for MacKay.</TEXT></DOC>
