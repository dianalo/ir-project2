Crandall of the Brookings Institutionin Washington and John D. Graham of the Harvard School of PublicHealth in Boston.   They estimated the standards applied to 1989 cars during 10years of road use would cause 2,200 to 3,900 traffic deaths.   Also Tuesday, the Transportation Department told Congress thatpassenger cars sold in the United States got 28.2 miles per gallonlast year overall, up 0.2 miles per gallon from the previous year.   Despite the good news on auto fuel economy, TransportationSecretary Jim Burnley used the report to reiterate his support forelimination of the fuel-economy requirement, saying it placed U.S.manufacturers at a disadvantage against their foreign competition.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>House Votes To Continue Incentives For Rare-Disease Drugs</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House has voted to continue and expand aprogram to encourage private companies to develop drugs forcombating rare diseases.   The bill was passed on a 401-1 vote Tuesday and sent to theSenate. It extends the so-called ``orphan drug'' program throughfiscal 1990. It would also expand the program, which is overseen bythe Food and Drug Administration, to include special devices andfoods needed to help people with unusual maladies.   Under the program, companies are given tax credits andseven-year exclusive marketing rights if they develop products forrare diseases. Without incentives, the companies would not pursuedevelopment of those products because the small number ofbeneficiaries would not make it profitable, according to supportersof the legislation.   The revised statute, while expanding the program, would tripleits cost in the next few years. The current annual authorization of$4 million would grow to $14 million in fiscal 1990.   The Reagan administration has said it has no objection to thelegislation.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>House Panel Approves Funds For Reagan And President-Elect</HEAD><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A House committee says it will cost $3.5million in transitional expenses for President Reagan's successorto move into the White House and cost Reagan $1 million to move toretirement in California next January.   The Government and Operations Committee Tuesday approved a billauthorizing the funds although the Democratic-controlled panelrejected a Republican move to increase the expense allowance tooffset the effects of inflation for the outgoing president to $1.5million from $1 million, the level in effect since 1976.   The proposed boost was opposed by Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, thepanel's chairman, who said the budget squeeze requires Congress to``make some hard choices'' on spending cuts.   The panel approved raising the president-elect's allowance fortransitional expenses to $3.5 million from $2 million, the level ineffect for the past 12 years. It also rejected, 24-9, a move byRep. Robert S. Walker, R-Pa., to forbid the president-elect fromaccepting private donations to supplement federal transitionalfunds.   The $1 million for Reagan's initial retirement expenses, ifapproved by the House and Senate, would cover his moving expensesfrom the White House to California and the costs of establishing anoffice for six months, until funds for former presidents becomeavailable under a separate law.</TEXT></DOC>
