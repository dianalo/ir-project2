The requests were made by letter on Oct. 16, three days afterCommon Cause, which describes itself as a citizens' lobby, askedthe committee to open an investigation of the contributions.   The contributions were made by Charles H. Keating, whose LincolnSavings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., owned throughArizona-based American Continental Corp., was taken over by theFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation in April of this year.   ``We got a letter two weeks ago from the Ethics Committeeadvising us of the Common Cause complaint and asking that we wouldplease write them a response,'' Murray Flander, press secretary toSen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said Friday.   The letter ``was a statement of the fact that Common Cause hadmade this request of the committee and asked the senators for aresponse,'' said Robert Maynes, a spokesman for Sen. DennisDeConcini, D-Ariz.   The five senators _ DeConcini; Cranston; John McCain, R-Ariz.;Don Riegle, D-Mich.; and John Glenn, D-Ohio _ intervened withregulators when examiners were considering what to do about Lincoln.   The senators have said they asked only that the long examinationbe brought to a conclusion and made no effort to influence actionsof the regulators.   The regulators have filed a $1.1 billion civil lawsuit againstKeating, members of his family and associates charging fraud andracketeering.   Some of the five senators had responded by Friday and some hadnot.   Flander said Cranston had not yet replied. An aide to Riegle whoasked not to be identified said the senator had responded but theaide said he could not say what the response was.   Spokesmen for McCain and Glenn were not home Friday evening.   Maynes said he gave the committee DeConcini's response beforethe letter was received.   Maynes and the Riegle aide said the Ethics Committee had givenno indication of what it planned to do next.   Maynes said he had made available DeConcini's response toreporters.   Describing that response in summary fashion, Maynes quotedDeConcini as saying on one occasion, ``If I had known then what Iknow now, I wouldn't have taken the money and I wouldn't have goneto the meetings.''   Members of Congress are obliged to try to help constituents withregulatory agencies, and American Continental had a $50 millionpayroll in the state, Maynes said.   DeConcini and Riegle have returned their campaign contributionsfrom Keating. Cranston never got campaign contributions, buthundreds of thousands of dollars were given to voter registrationdrives with which he was affiliated.</TEXT></DOC>
