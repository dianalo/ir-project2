<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0777 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effect of high-current relativistic electron beams (REB's) on theundulator field amplitude in free-electron lasers (FEL's) is investigated.Two mechanisms of excitation of periodic magnetostatic self-fields byREB are considered: a static mechanism that is realized at stationarymotion of REB in the undulator field; and a dynamic mechanism that isrealized at signal wave amplification. The static mechanism in the absenceof an axial magnetic field leads to a decrease of the total undulatorfield amplitude (a diamagnetic effect). The dynamic mechanism for low-densitybeams leads to an increase of the total undulator field amplitude (aparamagnetic effect), with a subsequent increase of electron efficiency.For high-density beams, the effect of the phase shift of the total undulatorfield is most essential, due to which the growth of the signal wave amplitudeis limited by nonlinear mismatch of synchronism.</TEXT></DOC>
