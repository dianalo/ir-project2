He called for a meeting of the U.N. Security Council to dealwith what he called ``one more escalation of the war againstNicaragua.''   American troops began arriving in Honduras today at 10:15 a.m.,a U.S. Embassy spokesman said. The United States and Honduras hadaccused Nicaragua of invading its neighbor in pursuit of Contrarebels.   The 26 C-141 planes carrying about 3,200 U.S. troops werearriving every 30 minutes at Palmerola air force base, the maincenter of U.S. military operations in Honduras.   Military officials in Honduras said Honduras troops continued tosurround about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops who they said entered thecountry. Nicaraguan defense officials denied their troops crossedinto Honduras.   Ortega, speaking at a news conference before a meeting with 14opposition parties, called the U.S. troop movement ``a dangerousact'' and said the United States was trying ``to use the Honduranarmy to save the Contra forces.''   Ortega earlier warned the nation that U.S. forces may invadeNicaragua to save Contra rebels, whom he said were driven intoHonduras by Sandinista troops.   Earlier, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said Nicaraguan soldierswere withdrawing from the Honduran border region and that thearrival of U.S. troops may damage government-Contra cease-firetalks.   Alejandro Bendana, secretary-general of the Foreign Ministry,told NBC's ``Today'' that Nicaraguan troops engaged in cross-firealong the border but did not enter Honduras.   ``We've been engaged in a routine military operation designed topush the Contras back across the border where they came from, inHonduran territory. That operation reached the border; there wasfiring at the border; there's been a cross-fire and there's beenfighting alongside the border,'' Bendana said.   ``The operations have succesfully been concluded, and we don'tplan to stay along the border region. In fact, this deescalationhas already begun,'' he said.   But Honduras military officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said today that about 4,000 Honduran soldiers weresurrounding about 2,000 Nicaraguan soldiers and had been since lateWednesday.   The sources said the entire Honduran military was on alert. Theysaid   the Sandinista soldiers had been in the border province ofOlancho, east of Tegucigalpa, for 24 hours when Honduran troopsencircled them Wednesday.   Bendana said the government had called for the United Nationsand Organization of American States to visit the area of fightingto ``establish what the facts are end these accusations.''   He said the deployment of American soldiers ``bodes ill'' forcease-fire talks scheduled Monday in Nicaragua but ``makes thenegotiations more urgent. We are bent on having the cease-firetalks begin on Monday once again.''   The government took control of all radio stations and broadcastthat Nicaraguan troops were being mobilized throughout the countryWednesday. The stations also broadcast revolutionary music.   Ortega told reporters: ``We are calling on the Nicaraguan publicto be alert, to be in combat readiness, ready to repel, resist,defeat whatever aggression from the United States.''   Ortega has neither confirmed nor denied that Nicaraguan soldierscrossed into Honduran territory, but Defense Ministry spokeswomanMaj. Rosa Pasos denied that Sandinista troops did so.   In a letter to Reagan released by the White House, HondurasPresident Jose Azcona Hoyo said his government had ordered itsarmed forces ``to repulse'' the Sandinista troops and asked for U.Smilitary assistance.   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater in Washington said theU.S. soldiers were to carry out training exercises and be ``asignal to the governments and the people of Central America.''   Palmerola air force base is about 125 miles west of the borderand 40 miles northwest of the Honduran capital, Tegucigalpa. Thebase is just south of the town of Comayagua.   The Contras have maintained secret bases along theHonduras-Nicaragua border from which they have staged attacks onNicaragua in their 6-year-old war to overthrow the Sandinistas.   Ortega said on Wednesday that Sandinista troops had pushed about2,000 Contra soldiers across the Rio Coco into Honduras in a majoroffensive the began March 6, the largest this year.   The Contras have said they have 6,000 of their rebels insideNicaragua, out of a total force of 10,000. Most of the 2,000Contras reportedly pushed into Honduras had been fighting inNicaragua's central Chontales province.   Nicaragua's Defense Ministry previously said the offensiveinvolved about 6,000 Sandinista troops in central and northwesternNicaragua. The Sandinista total military strength of 75,000,including reserves and militias, is by far the largest in CentralAmerica.   Ortega said the rebels have suffered 400 casualties, including92 dead. He said 34 soldiers of the Sandinista army, which issupplied and trained by Cuba and the Soviet Union, were killed and68 wounded.</TEXT></DOC>
