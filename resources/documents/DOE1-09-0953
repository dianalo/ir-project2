A newly developed intelligent pipelocator detects a magnetic field generated by flowing an alternating-currentthrough a buried pipe by means of a sensor unit placed on the groundand by computing and displaying with a micro-computer the position, depth,and the reliability of the detected result in only 3 seconds. Resultsof a half year field test since Sept. 1986 shows that the error was improvedtwice up to 5% from 10% of the conventional pipe locator. Operation timewas also reduced down to one-fifth of the former method. By the practicaluse of this locator on the spot, one can expect the security improvements,reduction of frilling cost, and more efficient operation. In Japan recently,the number of conventional pipe locator is more than 5000 units in about15 types. (10 figs, 7 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
