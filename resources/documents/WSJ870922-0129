Greenberg</HL><DD> 09/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAM </IN><TEXT>   A large majority of Americans have consistently opposed aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, and no set of events, no level of presidential cajoling, and no sounding alarms on Soviet and Cuban influence have managed to dislodge them. The resilience of the public opposition has frustrated the efforts of the Reagan administration to make these &quot;freedom fighters&quot; a vital element in an assertive, outward-looking and anti-Communist foreign policy.    Conventionally, public opposition to Contra aid has hovered around 60%, where it now stands, though at points and in response to the fear of U.S. military involvement, it has risen to nearly 70%. Only Oliver North's dramatic testimony in July seemed to produce hesitation, but it never produced a majority in favor of Contra aid, and its effects were fleeting.    Why are Americans so averse to becoming involved in Central America? Why have appeals to patriotism and democracy and the warnings about the Soviet, Libyan and Cuban menaces, even at the height of the president's popularity, failed to erode the opposition?    We have found in our intensive, focus/discussion group research, most of it in the conservative heartland of the country, that powerful antipathies operate on the public consciousness. Centered on negative attitudes toward Central America and its people, remembrances of Vietnam, and a strong desire to take care of problems at home, these antipathies transcend the policy debate and the daily news reports.    When voters hear the words &quot;Central America,&quot; for example, they do not see freedom fighters and a struggle for democracy. What they see is a &quot;jungle&quot; -- hot, tropical, overgrown, dirty, disease-infested and impenetrable. Central America brings to mind poverty, uneducated people and conflict, creating strong negative associations. One woman observed, &quot;I have this overwhelming feeling or negative, just 'ooh.' Sort of like living here at the ghetto in New York or Chicago -- all the bad things that happen.&quot;    More troubling for those who would fashion an East-West struggle in Nicaragua is the public's finding the Contras and the Sandinistas to be largely indistinguishable. We asked voters, alternatively, to describe a hypothetical Contra or a Sandinista who would appear suddenly at the door. The Contra or the Sandinista -- and it did not matter which -- was most often &quot;unshaven,&quot; &quot;scruffy, bearded&quot;; he was &quot;sweaty,&quot; &quot;dirty,&quot; &quot;dark dirty&quot;; he was &quot;Spanish-looking, Mexican-type clothing, uncultivated, sandals,&quot; &quot;dark complexion&quot;; he looked like &quot;Pancho Villa,&quot; a &quot;bandoleer of ammo,&quot; &quot;wearing fatigues,&quot; &quot;militaristic,&quot; &quot;trigger-happy, scared.&quot;    He was not a particularly sympathetic character. He was &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;loud,&quot; an &quot;arrogant, uniformed bully,&quot; a little &quot;desperate,&quot; &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;unfriendly,&quot; &quot;abrupt, uncompassionate,&quot; &quot;dedicated to a cause,&quot; &quot;yet a soldier of fortune.&quot;    That the images of the Contras and Sandinistas ran together was very much on the minds of these voters. &quot;I see the same person,&quot; one noted, and another agreed that &quot;the only difference is (the Contra) is more of a failure.&quot;    The aversion to Central America, the Contras and the Sandinistas makes the cost accounting on the hundreds of millions of dollars spent there much more important. Whether the request is $14 million, $100 million or $250 million, it just seems like a &quot;lot of money&quot; or a &quot;lot of zeros.&quot; How can impoverished, unshaven and unruly bands handle so much money?    Indeed, the administration's own portrayal of this &quot;underdog&quot; band seems to produce counterproductive results on the issue of cost accounting. The Contras, for many of the people we spoke to, are a ragtag operation, not really up to a grand struggle against communism and, thus, not a very sound investment.    Voters are quite ready to believe that the Contras are dishonest, inept, and losers. The Contra leaders, like foreign leaders generally, could be expected to &quot;pilfer&quot; the money and &quot;get their hands into the pot.&quot; More than one person wondered, &quot;Is this going to be just another empty hole to pour this money into, that nothing's going to come out of it?&quot;    Allusions to Vietnam, no matter how indirect, still produce great anxieties and aversions to the prospect of U.S. military involvement abroad. Voters, particularly women, do not want to refight Vietnam in Central America and resist any movement in that direction. An image of U.S. soldiers in combat produces pained feelings -- a reminder of personal tragedy, lost sons and husbands, an endless and futile commitment, a country divided and weak.    All of these antipathies to engagement in Central America come together in the sentiment, expressed with unqualified emotion, that America should get its own house in order first. That sentiment pervades public thinking and overwhelms virtually all other considerations, including concerns about communism or positive feelings about freedom fighters.    Throughout our research, people expressed their yearning for an American policy that gives priority to solving American problems. They believe the time has come to take &quot;care of ourselves at home,&quot; to tend &quot;to our own family first.&quot; And that means &quot;keeping our money here&quot; to get people educated, to fight drugs, to help our farmers and senior citizens.    Voters, to be sure, still worry about Soviet influence in the region and feel that the government should do something to oppose communism, particularly so close to the U.S. And Ollie North has managed to raise some questions about the character of the Contras. But these are relatively weak weapons in this perceptual battleground.    ---   Mr. Greenberg heads the Analysis Group, national Democratic pollsters. </TEXT></DOC>
