In this torrid scene from the TV miniseries &quot;I'll Take Manhattan,&quot; the camera lingers on their undulating bodies as the sound track dissolves into moans.    Fade to commercial: Two fresh-scrubbed, fully clothed young women look at Playtex bras while chirpy music lilts in the background. It is relentlessly wholesome. The TV networks won't have it any other way.    &quot;It's preposterous! There's the most peculiar double standard today,&quot; fumes Stephen Novick, an executive vice president of Grey Advertising Inc., who spliced the footage together to prove his point. &quot;The most blatant commercials are bland compared to what's on the networks,&quot; he says.    Most viewers take for granted the double standard for TV programs and commercials. National Broadcasting Co.'s &quot;Cheers&quot; can take place in a bar, for example -- yet hard-liquor commercials are taboo, and beer commercials can't show people drinking.    Now, advertisers say the split between commercials and programming is widening even further. Certainly, there have been a few well-publicized strides for advertisers; recently networks began permitting actresses to model bras in commercials and they now allow their TV stations to air condom commercials.    But programming has stretched the boundaries of good taste that much further. The tame bra commercials don't compare to the naked bodies rolling around beneath the sheets on shows like &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;Dynasty.&quot; The few chaste condom commercials are barely noticed amidst the scores of newscasts graphically detailing the spread of AIDS. Compared with most programming, TV commercials seem stuck in the 1950s.    &quot;It's as if when the commercials come on, (the viewer) is a Victorian,&quot; says Roy Grace, chairman of New York ad agency Grace andamp; Rothschild. &quot;But when it goes back to the programming, he's the wildest, drugged-out punk.&quot;    The networks keep detailed regulations on what is and isn't allowed in commercials. But most taste questions eventually come down to judgment calls. To do the job, the networks employ scores of people, who spend all day examining commercials as well as programming. CBS Inc. alone has 32 people in its program practices department.    The networks say they have to police commercials, because ads encourage people to imitate them, while programming is merely meant to entertain. Typically, advertisers send to the networks storyboards of planned commercials; then the networks examine every line and nuance, often sending commercials back for changes and sometimes rejecting them altogether. The process doesn't exactly endear the advertisers and networks to each other.    &quot;We get almost all of them initially rejected,&quot; says Jay Chiat of Chiat/Day Inc., a Los Angeles agency that has created advertising for Nike and Apple Computer. Adds Jerry Della Femina, of New York agency Della Femina, Travisano andamp; Partners: &quot;They sit there and say, 'Is that a breast?' They spend their time looking for filth. I've made a career out of fighting them.&quot;    Just a few of the rules, regulations, and whims:    PILLS: Don't try taking them on a commercial. In a holdover from the &quot;pill-popping&quot; 1970s, the networks refuse to show people putting aspirin, cold tablets, even Rolaids into their mouths.    &quot;Think about seeing every over-the-counter drug commercial, and think about seeing every one of those people popping a pill, all day,&quot; says Alan Wurtzel, vice president of broadcast standards and practices for Capital Cities/ABC Inc. &quot;You'd end up with the cumulative effect that is potentially very harmful.&quot;    PASSIONATE KISSING: Forget it. Even if Don Johnson does that and worse every Friday on &quot;Miami Vice,&quot; people on commercials almost always keep their mouths shut when they buss. &quot;Open-mouth kissing I would think would have gone too far,&quot; says ABC's Mr. Wurtzel. &quot;Perfume companies -- guys selling sex -- have tried to do some pretty hot things, but we've prevented that.&quot;    Indeed, when Close-Up toothpaste showed lingering kisses in one commercial, NBC put it on a &quot;restricted schedule&quot; -- allowing it to air only after 10 p.m. and during the daytime, when soap operas dominate the airwaves. The &quot;kissing was more open-mouthed than appropriate,&quot; says Ralph Daniels, NBC's vice president of broadcast standards, who says some viewers agreed.    Even couples who aren't kissing usually wear wedding rings in commercials, lest the viewer think anything unchaste is afoot. While the networks don't demand it, &quot;There have been circumstances where the relationship is ambiguous, and we thought it might be a useful device to clarify&quot; it, says NBC's Mr. Daniels. After all, he adds, &quot;We aren't trying to promote promiscuous behavior through advertising.&quot;    TOILET PAPER: Ever wonder why you always see it rolling down the stairs or being squeezed in the supermarket by Mr. Whipple, but never hanging in a bathroom? That's because in TV-land, toilet paper can't hang next to the toilet.    According to NBC's written guidelines on toilet paper, &quot;Direct or indirect references to product use and function . . . are not acceptable.&quot; Says George Dessart, vice president for program practices of CBS's broadcast group: &quot;We all know what toilet tissue is used for. That doesn't mean we necessarily need to show it.&quot;    LIQUOR: Hard-liquor advertising is out, no matter how often Blake Carrington hits the crystal decanter of scotch on &quot;Dynasty.&quot; Even props that might look like mixed drinks in commercials for other products are typically forbidden. Marvin Honig, recently named chairman and chief executive of William Esty Co. advertising, recalls that when he worked on the American Airlines account, &quot;not only could we not show anyone drinking (in an airplane lounge), we couldn't show a drink that might look alcoholic.&quot;    While beer ads are permitted, the networks generally don't allow ads to show people drinking the stuff. In fact, ABC's written regulations even prohibit &quot;sound effects of drinking.&quot; CBS, alone among the networks, does let ads depict people drinking beer. But virtually no one bothers, anyway: &quot;You don't want to do a commercial just for CBS,&quot; says Loretta Donato, director of legal clearance at Grey -- especially when a single commercial can cost more than $1 million.    FEMININE HYGIENE: Douche advertising is fine, as long as nobody mentions what it smells like or what it's used for. Tampons and feminine napkins are all right, too -- but don't even think about showing the product. &quot;We permit a very abstract representation, like a computer-enhanced drawing,&quot; says Mr. Wurtzel. &quot;Literally showing the actual tampon is overly graphic and unnecessary.&quot;    Advertisers think this rule is ridiculous. &quot;It's a piece of cardboard!&quot; protests Mr. Novick of Grey, which handles Playtex tampons. &quot;It isn't going to make somebody run from the room in horror.&quot;    Perhaps he will take heart in that the networks now allow the word &quot;period.&quot; Of course, they generally only tolerate it once in 30 seconds. When ABC first allowed the word, one commercial &quot;used it two or three times,&quot; Mr. Wurtzel says. &quot;They went too far. It was probably gratuitous.&quot;    EATING: Moderation is everything. Mr. Honig of William Esty recalls the trouble he ran into when he created the Frusen Gladje ice cream commercial featuring a housewife who tells her husband that she ate all the Frusen Gladje -- &quot;and I'd do it again.&quot; &quot;The gluttony question came up from the networks,&quot; he says. &quot;So I said, 'We'll just show her licking the spoon. You don't see her out of control to get it into her mouth.&quot;    Mr. Honig is quite familiar with the networks' sensitivity to gastrointestinal matters. Years ago, he created a number of Alka Seltzer ads, including one in which a frog puppet drank Alka Seltzer and burped. It was rejected. Says ABC's Mr. Wurtzel: &quot;Do you want to see somebody burping on TV? A lot of time creators find it funny, but you may not.&quot;    TOILET BOWLS: Yes, you can show them on the tube now, although for many years they were banned.    But just because you see it, don't expect to hear its name. In years past, &quot;You couldn't say 'toilet' on TV. Now they adjusted it so you can say 'toilet' once&quot; during a commercial, says Diane Rothschild, president of ad agency Grace andamp; Rothschild. (Actually, network policies vary; generally it's a question of taste, although CBS says it still doesn't use the word at all.)    The bowl, by the way, doesn't flush. &quot;There's no reason to show that,&quot; says Mr. Daniels of NBC, because it's too &quot;graphic.&quot; And while ABC will show a flush in, say a toilet bowl-cleaner ad, it says it won't use the sound.    DEODORANT: Don't even try depicting wetness, odor, or where or how you use it. Otherwise, it's just fine.    COMEDY: The networks take it very seriously. In fact, ad agency Altschiller Reitzfeld Inc. once abandoned a humorous Tic Tacs ad because the networks were so worried about it. It had planned to show a Danny DeVito-like comic character kissing a beautiful woman for more than an hour to demonstrate how long the candy freshens breath -- but the networks objected to the couple kissing without establishing their relationship first.    More than a decade of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; notwithstanding, the networks were also nervous about a satirical Regina vacuum cleaner ad in which diners at a fancy restaurant are given ground-up clam shells and sand instead of coffee. (The upset diners then start overturning tables and dust and dirt flies -- setting the stage for the cleanup.) &quot;They wanted us to use something other than clamshells. They said it's dangerous . . . . We wouldn't want (to encourage) people to make coffee with clamshells and sand,&quot; recalls Ron Berger of ad agency Messner, Vetere, Berger, Carey Inc., which created the campaign. He sighs: &quot;These are the kind of things you run into.&quot;    Grey ran into a different problem with a humorous frozen pizza ad in which a woman opens a freezer and a pizza chef inside hands her the pizza pie. &quot;One of the networks rejected it because they were afraid a kid would lock himself into the refrigerator,&quot; says Ms. Donato. &quot;That's taking it a little too far.&quot;    Certainly, advertising has loosened up since years past, when tampon commercials were off-limits and bra packages with pictures of models on them could take up no more than one-third of the TV screen. But to advertisers, sometimes it seems that every time they take a step forward, the networks make a giant leap backwards.    Ms. Donato of Grey Advertising recalls a Calgon bath beads commercial from 1972 that showed a woman lounging in a bathtub. &quot;I sent the exact same commercial back to one network in 1985,&quot; she says &quot;And they rejected it. They felt it was too sexy.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
