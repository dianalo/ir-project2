Thatargument is over. A radical shift has taken place in the Gulf debate. It isnow war vs. diplomacy.;    The end of sanctions as a serious policyalternative was signaled by a white paper issued in late December by HouseArmed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin. It subjects the sanctions optionto close scrutiny, under which it simply falls apart.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  U.S. MUST FORCE IRAQ'S UNCONDITIONAL WITHDRAWALFROM KUWAIT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary.Charles Krauthammer is a nationally syndicated columnist.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Sanctions are a multi-year proposition, and, before Iraq succumbs, theanti-Iraq coalition, its cohesion, its morale, even some of its leaders (bybullet or coup) will have long succumbed.;    Moreover, a switch to sanctionsalone would not only be a great psychological victory for Saddam, effectivelycanceling the U.N. Jan. 15 ultimatum. It would necessitate the drawdown ofAmerican forces in Saudi Arabia, panicking the Gulf Arabs who sided with us.That would drive them to Saddam and us out of the Gulf.;    It is, finally,hard to take sanctions seriously when both the Associated Press and WashingtonPost report from Baghdad that a thousand Soviet nationals in Iraq have decidedto stay rather than return home to conditions in the Soviet Union.;    Assanctions fade, the only alternative to the Bush policy of securing Saddam'sretreat by war -- or, if we are both convincing and lucky, the threat of war-- is a &quot;diplomatic solution.&quot;;    What kind? In his Sept. 24 U.N. speech,Francois Mitterrand gave Saddam the outline: Withdraw from Kuwait, after which&quot;everything would be possible.&quot;;    Aspin, being less Gallic and thus lesscryptic, has spelled out what &quot;everything&quot; means. There are three kinds ofgoodies we can give Saddam if he is a nice boy and gets out of Kuwait:;    1)Pieces of Kuwait or, in a more sophisticated version, a mechanism forcontinuing to press claims against Kuwait;;    2) Nice treatment of Iraq, apromise to leave Saddam and his regime intact, to lift the embargo, to seek noreparations for raping Kuwait, etc.; and;    3) Linkage to the Arab-Israeliissue, which for Saddam means achieving legendary status in the Arab world asthe man who sacrificed his 19th province to redeem Palestine.;    Now,everyone understands that rewarding Saddam with these goodies constitutes rankAmerican capitulation. The art of this deal, therefore, is to disguise thecapitulation by interposing a decent interval between Saddam's withdrawal andhis subsequent payoff. The hope is that a gullible and distracted Americanpublic will not notice that Saddam won.;    Of course, the Arabs will notice.Those who sided with the loser, us, will rue the day they decided to casttheir lot with America. The rest will quickly submit to the man who stood downAmerica and the world. And in a very few years, even Americans will be forcedto notice when Saddam, on the move again, reappears on American radar, thistime with intercontinental missiles and nuclear weapons.;    &quot;After Kuwait,everything is possible&quot; abandons the U.N. demand for unconditional withdrawal.That would be disastrous not because of some legalistic belief in U.N.resolutions, but because to allow a conditional withdrawal from Kuwait is toundermine the whole purpose of American policy in the Gulf.;    The liberationof Kuwait is important, but American soldiers have not journeyed 6,000 milesto the sands of Arabia just for that. If a bunch of local Kuwaitis had stageda coup and proclaimed an equally brutal, pro-Iraqi, anti-American regime, wewould, rightly, not have lifted a finger.;    The reason we are in the Gulf isnot Kuwait but Iraq. Kuwait happens to be the place that a heavily armed,utterly ruthless, endlessly ambitious, highly dangerous regional thug made hisfirst grab for Gulf and Arab hegemony. Kuwait is Saddam's first target. Thepoint of our policy is to make sure that Kuwait is his last.;    That is whyevacuating Kuwait is not enough. Liberating Kuwait is the means. DefeatingSaddam is the end. And unconditional withdrawal -- nothing to show for twowars of aggression, 10 years of blood -- might well undo him.;    Aconditional withdrawal, on the other hand, which is what a &quot;diplomaticsolution&quot; is all about, means aggression rewarded and Saddam strengthened.;   Conditional withdrawal is defeat by tape delay. But because it might sell inthe West, President Bush will be under tremendous pressure to accept just thiskind of deal. The Europeans are already urging it on him. The Democrats arenext.;    It is all very tempting. The media, with a historical memorymeasured in weeks, will hail him as a peacemaker and liberator. Bush will knowbetter. He will know that he forfeited security in the Gulf, America'sstanding in the Arab world and any possibility for a stable, post-Cold Warorder. But all that will come later. First will come the praise.;    For Bush,the temptation is Faustian, and the greatest test of his political life.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910106  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  846  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday January 6, 199100006205,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
