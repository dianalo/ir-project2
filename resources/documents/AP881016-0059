(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Youth gangs are ``America's terrorists''and the greatest challenge facing the nation's police chiefs, saidthe head of the International Association of Chiefs of Police.   ``(Gangs have) taken over entire sections of major cities andare spreading to the streets in smaller cities,'' said Joe Casey,chief of the Nashville Police Department. ``I don't know of anyterrorist group that's done that.''   Casey is president of the assocation, which officially opened itannual convention in Portland on Sunday.   Between 5,000 and 7,000 top law enforcement officials from theUnited States and 43 countries are expected to attend theconvention, which runs through Thursday.   Speakers include U.S. Attorney General Richard Thornburgh, FBIDirector William Sessions and John C. Lawn, head of the federalDrug Enforcement Administration.   Participants at a convention workshop on Saturday said lawenforcement officials need to cooperate with community leaders andeducators in the fight against gangs.   ``It's the short-term efforts, like (gang) sweeps, that get alot of attention,'' said Bernard C. Parks, deputy police chief inLos Angeles. ``But it's the active role of communities that canhelp.   ``There (have) to be a good number of changes in the schools andin adult education,'' he said. ``The responsibility has to bespread to all areas.''   Parks said Los Angeles police had on file names of some 26,000gang members, more than double the number in the 1970s.   Nevertheless, Parks said, his city is unwilling to shoulder theblame for the spread of gang violence.   ``Many communities that experience the gang problem find it alltoo convenient to blame it on Los Angeles,'' said Parks. ``There isa lot of mimicking by kids in different places. It doesn'tnecessarily mean they come from Los Angeles.''</TEXT></DOC>
