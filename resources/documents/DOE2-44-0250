A number of facilities in many houses todayform application-specific networks e.g. the central heating system, thetelephone system etc. In the future, they could each form part of oneintegrated network. The key to the whole concept is the communicationstechnology which will enable microelectronics and sensor technology tobe harnessed for a wide range of domestic applications. Several mediaare appropriate to a home-automation network: mainsborne signalling,infra-red, radio, wire pair, coaxial cable and optical fibre. This articlediscusses development trends in these communication technologies as theyrelate to their potential use for home automation.</TEXT></DOC>
