The African Elephant Conservation Act of 1988 (hereafterthe Act), enacted on October 7, 1988, significantly restricts the importand export of African elephant ivory and dictates substantial changes tothe existing special rules. Under the proposed rule, the Service would review the elephant conservationprograms of African countries having wild elephant populations (ivory producingcountries) to determine whether or not each country meets certain criteria.The Service would impose moratoria on imports of African elephant ivoryfrom ivory producing countries and countries that import and export elephantivory (intermediary countries) which fail to meet certain standards ofelephant conservation, as defined in the Act. In accordance with the Act,the proposed rule also delineates permissible foreign commerce in raw andworked ivory.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before July 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments and materials concerning this proposal shouldbe sent to the Director, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O.

Under theauthority of section 4(d) of the Endangered Species Act, the Service concurrentlypromulgated special rules for the import and export of raw and worked ivory,50 CFR 17.40(e). These rules were amended on July 20, 1982 (47 FR 31384).The African elephant was also listed on Appendix II of the Convention onInternational Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna an Flora (CITES)on February 4, 1977. Despite this legal protection, poaching of elephants in Africa and worldwideillegal trade in African elephant ivory have continued at an alarming rate.Experts now consider the unlawful killing of African elephants for ivorythe primary factor in the recent troubling decline of this species in thewild. For example, scientists working under the auspices of the UnitedNations Environment Programme, the Serengeti Wildlife Research Institute,and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) found that elephant populations in EastAfrica (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania) have declined betwen 49% and 92% since1973 as a result of poaching for ivory. Regional trends in elephant numbersrange from -18% per year in the northern African savanna and -8% per annumin East Africa, to near stability in the protected areas of southern Africa.The consensus is that African elephant populations throughout the continentcannot sustain present levels of decline without becoming endangered. Since 1977, when the African elephant was added to Appendix II of CITES,the parties have become increasingly concerned over the accelerating declineof the species. This concern has been reflected in a number of resolutionsregarding the ivory trade at the biennial conferences of the parties in1981, 1985, and 1987. In 1981, at the 3rd Conference of the parties, ResolutionConf. 3.12 recommended that parties impose several measures which morestrictly controlled the trade in African elephant ivory than did the Conventionalone. At the 5th Conference of the parties to CITES in 1985, the Secretariatwas authorized to establish the Ivory Control System (Resolution Conf.5.12). These procedures suggest steps that party nations should take tostrictly control the import, export, and re-export of raw and worked ivory.The procedures were also designed to maximize the flow of data on internationalcommerce in African elephant ivory to and from the Secretariat, which actsas a central clearinghouse of information on the ivory trade. It is theresponsibility of individual party countries, such as the United States,to effectively control the ivory trade within their respective jurisdictions.The United States is a major consumer of African elephant ivory, especiallyworked ivory, according to recent statistics compiled by the Service andWWF. Although relatively small amounts of raw ivory enter the United Stateseach year (mostly hunting trophies), approximately 73 metric tons (18-33million dollars worth) of worked ivory is imported, largely in the formof carved tusks and jewelry. WWF estimates that the United States accountsfor aobut one-third of the reported world trade in worked ivory, and 10-12%of the total annual exports of ivory from Africa. Approximately 65% ofthe worked ivory is imported from Hong Kong, and the United States receivesabout 32% of Hong Kong's total exports of worked ivory, according to estimatesby WWF-Hong Kong.It is difficult for the United States to determine independently whetherworked ivory presented for impact clearance came originally from a legalsource or whether it was from poached elephants. Therefore, it has beennecessary to rely on other countries' control procedures and enforcementprograms to ensure the legality of ivory in commerce. In the past, theCITES parties generally agreed that if trade in raw ivory could be controlled,it would not be necessary to impose additional controls on worked ivory.However, the African Elephant and Rhino Specialist Group of the InternationalUnion for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) Species SurvivalCommission estimates that most raw ivory now originates from poached elephants,and that the number of tusks taken from the wild in 1988 exceeded whatthe African countries declared acceptable for export under the CITES IvoryControl System, notwithstanding the ivory stocks on hand in some of thesecountries. Given the difficulties in controlling the international tradein raw ivory, it has become necessary to levy additional domestic controlson imports of worked ivory.The provisions of the African Elephant Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 4201<T3>et seq.</T3>, went into effect on October 7, 1988. The Service believesthat the Act and the proposed rule will implement and strengthen the CITESIvory Control System in the United States and overseas, and will help toreduce the extent of the illegal ivory trade and its impact on Africanelephants in the wild. It is the intent of the Service in this rulemakingto further implement the Act in a manner which facilitates the preservationof the African elephant. This proposal does not, however, serve to delaythe effectiveness of the Act itself, which was implemented by the Serviceon the date of enactment.The Service also notes that section 2302 of the Act provides explicitlythat the Act does not affect the authority of the Secretary under the EndangeredSpecies Act. The Service intends the proposed rule to satisfy section 4(d)of the Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1533(d), which requires that specialrules for threatened species be ``necessary and advisable to provide forthe conservation of such species''. However, the service is currently reviewinga petition to reclassify the African elephant from threatened to endangeredunder the Endangered Species Act. Therefore, the Service advises that basedon the results of that review and the comments and additional informationreceived during the public comment period, the special rules may be revisedto preclude the importation of raw and/or worked ivory from any or allcountries.<ITAG tagnum="84">Moratoria on Ivory Imports</ITAG>Congress has found that a limited and carefully controlled amount of tradein African elephant ivory has the potential to benefit elephant populationsby making their conservation of economic value to ivory producing countries.The sale of ivory from elephants that die naturally or are killed as partof necessary wildlife management operations, together with legal sporthunting, may stimulate revenues for elephant conservation programs in Africa.Although Congress did not impose a total moratorium on commerce in Africanelephant ivory, the United States must be able to eliminate the importationof ivory coming from or through countries known to serve as entrepots forthe illegal trade. That Act and the proposed rule set up a specific procedurewhereby the Service will review the elephant conservation programs of ivoryproducing countries to determine if these programs are adequate under aset of criteria established by section 2201 of the Act. In conducting thisreview and making determinations, the Service may consult with the countriesinvolved, the CITES Secretariat, and others having expertise on the Africanelephant, as appropriate.Under the proposed rule and section 2202 of the Act, the Service will establishmoratoria on the importation of ivory from specific ivory production countrieswhich do not meet all the criteria set forth in section 2201 of the Act.Similarly, moratoria will be established on the importation of ivory fromintermediary countries that fall into any of the categories set forth insection 2202(b) of the Act. On December 27, 1988, acting in accordancewith section 2202 of the Act, the Service imposed such moratoria on allcountries which are not parties to CITES (53 FR 52242).Consistent with section 2202(c) of the Act, the proposed rule providesfor the suspension of a moratorium on ivory imports from a particular countryif the Service determines, after notice and an opportunity for public comment,that the reasons for establishing the moratorium no longer exist.<ITAG tagnum="84">Sport Hunted Trophies</ITAG>Congress specifically addressed the importation of sport hunted elephanttrophies containing ivory in section 2202(e) of the Act.Under this section and the proposed rule, individuals may import trophyivory that has been legally taken in an ivory producing country for whichnotice has been published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of the establishment of an export quota underthe CITES Ivory Control System for the year of export. The country doesnot necessarily have to be a party to CITES. Upon notification by the CITESSecretariat, the Service will promptly publish a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> announcing the establishment of annual ivoryexport quotas.Under the Act, moratoria will not be imposed that would prohibit the importinto the United States of trophy ivory that was legally taken in an ivoryproducing country which as submitted a quota to the CITES Secretariat.<ITAG tagnum="84">Confiscated Ivory</ITAG>In section 2202(f) of the Act, Congress specifically provided for the importationof ivory originating in unlawfully taken stocks which have been seizedby ivory producing or intermediary countries and legally disposed of pursuantto the CITES Ivory Control System. The establishment of a moratorium onivory imports would not be based solely on trade in legitimately confiscatedivory which has been exported from the country of seizure in accordancewith the CITES Ivory Control System. However, these provisions would notapply if the proceeds from the sale of such confiscated ivory were usedfor any purpose other than to enhance wildlife conservation programs orthe conservation purposes of CITES. It is the express intent of Congressthat confiscated ivory be disposed of in an open and public manner thatincludes safeguards to prevent persons involved in elephant poaching andthe illegal trade in ivory from acquiring confiscated ivory at auctionor receiving any of the proceeds from its sale. Congress also directedthe Service to use all authorized means to collect sufficient informationto verify the terms and conditions under which each sale of confiscatedivory takes place and the manner in which the proceeds are allocated, priorto sanctioning the importation of ivory stemming from such a sale.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ray Ivory Imports</ITAG>The Act and the proposed rule significantly restrict commerce in raw Africanelephant ivory. Under current regulations (50 CFR 17.40(e)), raw ivorycould have been imported if it:1. Was from an elephant taken in a country that at the time of importationis a party to CITES;2. Was imported from a country that is a party to CITES;3. Was accompanied by proper CITES export permits and documentation under50 CFR 23 which clearly show the country of origin of the ivory; and 4. Was properly marked, if feasible.The Act (section 2203) and the proposed rule allow raw ivory to be importedonly:1. From an ivory producing country which is not subject to an ivory importmoratorium at the time of exportation; and2. If it was exported in compliance with the laws of the ivory producingcountry and accompanied by permits issued in accordance with the CITESIvory Control System and 50 CFR Part 23.The major effect of the Act and the proposed rule is that commercial shipmentsof raw ivory may only be imported from countries that have wild elephantpopulations, are parties to CITES, have submitted ivory export quotas tothe CITES Secretariat, and are not subject to an ivory import moratorium.This precludes, for example, the importation of raw ivory from countriessuch as Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, since they have no wild elephants.However, since most raw ivory imports are sport-hunted trophies, this shouldnot significantly restrict legitimate importers. The proposed rule wouldalso make it much easier for Service law enforcement personnel to determinethe legality of raw ivory shipments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Worked Ivory Imports</ITAG>Current regulations allowed the import of worked ivory if it:1. Was imported from a country which is a party to CITES; and2. Was accompanied by a valid CITES export permit or re-export certificateindicating the country of origin (per 50 CFR 23).Under the new system established by the Act and the proposed rule, workedivory may imported only:1. From an ivory producing or intermediary country which is not subjectto an ivory import moratorium at the time of exportation; and2. If it is accompanied by a valid CITES export permit or re-export certificate,except for worked ivory imported as personal personal effects.Countries exporting worked ivory are required to certify that the workedivory was derived from a legal source by issuing a CITES export permitor re-export certificate. No worked ivory may imported that is from a countryon which an ivory import moratorium has been imposed. In addition to theimport restrictions established by these provisions, any worked ivory thatwas derived from raw ivory which was taken or exported in violation ofthe laws of a producing country would be subject to seizure under the LaceyAct, 16 U.S.C. 3372(a)(2)(A), whether or not a CITES permit has been issuedfor the export of that ivory.<ITAG tagnum="84">Exports</ITAG>Under current regulations, raw ivory could have been exported from theUnited States under a permit if the ivory was properly marked, where feasible.The Act now prohibits all exports of raw ivory from the United States,and this is reflected in the proposed rule. Historically, very little rawivory has been exported from the United States, and Congress apparentlydetermined that it would not be cost-effective to expend the resourcesnecessary to bring the United States into compliance with the CITES IvoryControl System regarding the export of raw ivory. Moreover, it would beinconsistent for the United States, which is not an ivory producing country,to allow the export of raw ivory, when the Act prohibits the import ofraw ivory from non-producing countries. Worked ivory could still be exportedunder a permit issued by the Service's Office of Management Authority inaccordance with 50 CFR 23.<ITAG tagnum="84">Licensing Requirement</ITAG>Section 2301 of the Act provides that it is unlawful for any person, withoutfirst having obtained the permission of the Secretary of the Interior,to commercially import or export African elephant ivory. Accordingly, theproposed rule requires that all persons who are engaged in the businessof importing or exporting elephant ivory be licensed by the Service asprovided in 50 CFR 14.91, regardless of the amount or value of their annualtrade.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note.</T4>_The Department of the Interior has determined that thisdocument is not a major rule under Executive Order 12291 and certifiesthat this proposed rule will not have a significant effect on a substantialnumber of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The information collection requirements contained inthis regulation have been approved by the Office of Management and Budgetunder the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>, and assigned clearance number 1018-0022. There are nonew information collection requirements contained in this document thatrequire Office of Management and Budget clearance. In accordance with ExecutiveOrder No. 12630, the Service has determined that the proposed rule hasno potential takings implications for private property as defined in theExecutive Order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An environmental assessment on the listing of the African elelphantas a threatened species and the promulgation of special rules was preparedby the Service in 1978.
