A former chairman of Krupp Stahl AG was arrested in September on suspicion of awarding inflated service contracts to friends in the steel industry. The same month, a former employee of Volkswagen AG confessed to complicity in a spectacular foreign-exchange fraud.    In January, two co-managers of the Nukem G.m.b.H. nuclear-services group were suspended as part of an inquiry into allegations of widespread bribery in the nuclear industry. And in February, Nixdorf Computer AG filed charges against its top public-relations executive and three other senior employees for allegedly defrauding the computer company of millions of marks.    West Germany is being swept by a white-collar crime wave that is costing industry anywhere from 50 billion marks to 100 billion marks ($30 billion to $60 billion) a year, according to the Federation of German Criminal Officials. Some companies and even entire industries are being stung by investigations and regulatory crackdowns. The trend has criminologists asking if more German managers are breaking the law more often or if better-trained state prosecutors are getting more adept at piercing the veil around German industry.    &quot;It's a parallel development,&quot; says Volker Gehm, head of the economic-crime division of the Federal Criminal Office. &quot;We've developed a much better system of detecting and prosecuting offenders in the kinds of things that have always gone on, but we've been in the business long enough to see that the number of big cases has risen in recent years.&quot;    West Germany's Justice Ministry stopped compiling economic-crime statistics two years ago, but the ministry's last such report showed a stunning increase. Between 1982 and 1985, the number of charges filed involving economic crime -- including fraud, tax evasion and insurance swindles -- soared more than fivefold, to 505,000 from 96,000.    Law-enforcement officials say the problem is getting worse -- and add that reported cases represent only the tip of the iceberg. &quot;I could name several cases being held under wraps by the companies themselves&quot; in the hope of averting bad publicity, says Norbert Pabst, a Braunschweig prosecutor involved in the VW case. Typically, he says, a company that discovers irregularities asks the offending executive to resign without a pension or severance pay, and the affair is quietly smoothed over.    State attorneys are more skillful at getting hard evidence against suspects, with the result that more than two-thirds of investigations lead to formal charges, up from slightly more than 50% a decade ago. One reason is that prosecutors have added economic-crime specialists to their staffs. Their expertise paid off in the VW currency-trading case. &quot;The suspects thought up to the last minute . . . that the police were just too dumb to figure it out,&quot; says Juergen Albrecht, a Federal Crime Office agent. &quot;Tough luck for them that we brought along our own experts&quot; in foreign-exchange trading.    An immediate result of the VW affair was a crackdown on currency trading by bank regulators and the central bank. Lawmakers also are considering laws to control the &quot;parking&quot; of foreign-exchange positions by banks at other banks to skirt strict laws on overnight currency exposure. The banks themselves are facing an increase in spot checks by regulators.    A similar regulatory reaction was triggered by revelations of corruption in the nuclear industry, including bribery and the illegal shipment of nuclear waste. Apart from crippling the pro-nuclear lobby, the scandal spawned a Federal Atomic Regulatory Commission and a long list of stricter controls.    Still, critics say controls over emerging services industries and securities sectors remain too lax. Insider trading, still only a misdemeanor under the law, is almost untraceable in West Germany. No single regulatory body like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission exists. Instead, West German securities firms work under a &quot;voluntary code&quot; of refraining from using insider information for profit.    &quot;Basically, we state attorneys are doing what the SEC does in the U.S., but with wholly insufficient means,&quot; says Reinhard Roches of the Frankfurt prosecutor's office.    The rise in white-collar crime has tarnished the image of West German business, long esteemed for maintaining a strict code of ethics that set an example for the rest of the country. &quot;People in Germany are looking around to see what other people are doing (that is unethical) and saying, 'Why don't we do the same?'&quot; says Karlhans Liebl, a criminologist at the Max Planck Institute, a private research group.    He cites the current investigation of some West German doctors in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia for allegedly billing insurers for the treatment of patients long dead. &quot;More ordinary people are getting involved in a world where the upper classes once dominated,&quot; says Mr. Liebl. </TEXT></DOC>
