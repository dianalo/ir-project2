(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A family who found asbestos insulationthroughout their home can't sell the house, can't afford torenovate it, and contractors refuse to tear it down, and theirinsurance company won't pay a penny.   The Selphs have abandoned their home of 14 years and along withit, most of their asbestos-covered belongings, including toys,furniture and their daughter's college diploma. Even the vacuumcleaner had to be ditched.   ``All my pictures _ everything I've had since my kids werebabies _ it's all in there, covered with asbestos,'' Carol Selphsaid. ``I feel like we've been living in Pandora's Box.''   It will cost more to have the cancer-causing asbestos removedthan the 40-year-old house is worth, and their insurance won'tcover anything, because it doesn't cover that kind of contamination.   And the Selphs can't sell the home unless the asbestos isremoved.   Contractors refuse to demolish the structure since workers wouldneed to take special precautions, and the hazardous materials can'tbe disposed of in the county landfill.   ``Some people ask when we'll be moving back in, but they don'tunderstand the immensity of the problem,'' Mrs. Selph said. ``Thepeople in the community have been so nice to us. Churches have hadfund-raisers and offerings for us. People have given us gifts,furnishings and clothing.''   Asbestos was commonly used for insulation until the dangersbecame known, but it was rarely used in the construction of homes.No other homes in Jasper have been found to contain asbestos.   ``It's very unusual to find asbestos in the walls and ceilingsof homes, even homes built around that time,'' said Edward Palagyi,asbestos coordinator for the state Department of EnvironmentalRegulation.   When asbestos was used in homes, Palagyi said, it usually was towrap pipes.   The Selph's troubles began in August when they had a heat pumpand ventilation outlets put in.   ``I didn't know anything about it until two days after thesystem was installed and I asked a worker if they could repair somecracks,'' Mrs. Selph said. ``He said he couldn't and then told meit was asbestos. I was floored.''   To install the heat pump and vents, employees of Kinsey's AirConditioning had to cut through walls and the ceiling. That madethe asbestos friable, or flaking, and the new system wafted fineasbestos dust throughout the house.   Samples of the walls and ceiling were found to be 60 percent to65 percent asbestos, and Selphs were urged to move out.   ``We know it's in our lungs, no doubt about that,'' Mrs. Selphsaid. ``But we've all had baseline chest X-rays, except my husband,and everything looked fine.''   The family now lives in a rented house a few miles outside oftown. They have hired an attorney in hopes of finding some way topay for the asbestos removal.</TEXT></DOC>
