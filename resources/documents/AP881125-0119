In south Lebanon, Israeli warplanes blasted bases used byPalestinian guerrillas and allied Lebanese militiamen, killing fiveguerrillas and wounding 15 other people. It was the 23rd Israeli airraid in Lebanon this year.   Fighting in Beirut pitted the mainstream Shiite militia Amal(Hope) against the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. Policesaid at least 10 people were killed and 20 wounded, most of themcivilians, since it began Thursday evening.   It was the first time the Amal-Hezbollah struggle for dominationof Lebanon's 1 million Shiites reached the residential neighborhoodsand once-glamorous hotel district of central Beirut. Previousbattles in the area during Lebanon's 13 years of civil war haveinvolved other rival militias.   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella group for factionsholding most of the 14 foreigners missing in Lebanon, nine of whomare Americans. Police said it was not known whether the fightingwith tanks, mortars and rockets had affected the hostages, who arethought to be in the southern slums.   ``We have vague information that the majority of the foreignhostages are there but we don't know where exactly they are beingheld,'' said a police spokesman, whose name was withheld in keepingwith regulations.   Commanders of Syrian army units in charge of security in Moslemwest and south Beirut ordered a cease-fire Friday night.   ``Fighting ebbed in the city but clashes persisted in the slumsafter the latest truce was called,'' the spokesman said.   ``Both sides are massing fighters and fortifying theirpositions,'' he said.   Amal fighters gained some territory, advancing behind tanks, thespokesman said.   Stray shells hit several apartment buildings in the south Beirutslums, setting them afire and forcing residents into basements andbomb shelters. Shell explosions and machine gun fire reverberatedacross the city.   Umm Mohammed, of the Haret Hreik slum district, said she waspreparing dinner when the fighting began.   ``My daughter, three grandchildren and I rushed to the basementfor cover,'' she said. ``We didn't have dinner.   ``There was a short lull around midnight. When I tried to fetchsome food from the apartment I saw Amal tanks rumbling across thenarrow alley and the Hezbollahis started shooting at them. I rushedback to the basement.''   Beirut's hotel district had been free of battle since 7,500Syrian soldiers moved into west Beirut in February 1987 to stop awar among other Moslem militias. Syria has more than 30,000 troopsin Lebanon, most of them in the east and north, and has become themain power broker in the faction-ridden country.   The confrontation betwen Amal and Hezbollah spread into westBeirut early Friday when a rocket-propelled grenade hit theapartment of Ayoub Homayed, a ranking Amal leader. It exploded in abedroom but the family was in the kitchen and no one was hurt.   Each side accused the other of provoking the battle, the firstbetween them since Syrian troops intervened to stop protractedfighting last May. It followed closely on an unsuccessful attemptMonday to assassinate four Hezbollah leaders.   In Sidon, the ancient port 25 miles south of Beirut, four Israelijet fighters fired eight rockets into guerrilla bases on the city'seastern fringe, a police spokesman reported. He said the Israelismade two attacks, five minutes apart, about 2 p.m.   He said the rockets demolished a single-story building,camouflaged in an olive grove, that served as a base for the PopularFront for the Liberation of Palestine led by George Habash and thePopular Nasserite Organization, a Lebanese militia that ispredominantly Sunni Moslem.   An adjacent one-story building used by the Sunni militia wasdamaged, the police reported.   They said those killed were three Popular Nasserite militiamenand two guerrillas from the Habash group. Nine of the 15 woundedwere civilians, including three children, the police said.   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said its warplanes destroyedan ammunition depot north of Sidon and returned safely.   The raid came three days after Israeli jets and helicoptergunships attacked a guerrilla checkpoint at the Ein el-Hilwehrefugee camp outside Sidon, killing six people and wounding nine.   By police count, 119 people have been killed and 333 wounded inthe 23 air raids this year.</TEXT></DOC>
