FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant located in Oswego County,New York. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Assessment </ITAG>Identification of Proposed Action The licensee would be exempted from the requirements of section IV.A. ofappendix J to 10 CFR part 50 to the extent that a Type A, Type B, or TypeC Leak Rate Test would not have to be performed following repair of WeldNumber 10-14-884A in the ``B'' Core Spray System full flow test returnpiping to the suppression chamber (Pipe No. 10andmin16;andmin16;-W23-152-9B)prior to startup from the current maintenance outage. The weld would besubject to a Type A Primary Containment Leak Rate Test prior to startupfrom the next refueling outage, which is scheduled to start in March 1990.The Need for the Proposed Action In accordance with section IV.A. of appendix J, a Type A, Type B or TypeC Test (as applicable) is required to be performed following any majormodification or replacement of a component which is part of the primarycontainment boundary. An inservice inspection conducted during the currentmid-cycle maintenance outage has revealed the presence of a slag inclusionwithin Weld Number 10-14-884A, which has been repaired in accordance withASME Section XI and ANSI B-31.1-1967. In order to comply with the intentof appendix J, the licensee has determined that the Type A, Type B, orType C Leak Rate Test criteria are applicable. However, the licensee hasalso determined that, because of the location of the weld repair, an isolatablevolume cannot be attained. Therefore, pressure testing can only be accomplishedby performing a Type A primary containment integrated leak rate test. Further,the licensee has determined that performance of a Type A test is not feasibleat this time since it would seriously delay plant startup from the currentmaintenance outage. Therefore, the licensee has requested an exemptionfrom section IV.A. of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. In lieu of a Type A, Type B, or Type C Test, the licensee has proposed100 percent radiography, surface examination of the affected weld repair,and an inservice flow test. This will ensure that the intent of sectionIV.A. (the identification of any potential leakage paths resulting fromrepair of a component which is part of the primary containment boundary)is met. Environmental Impact of the Proposed Action The alternate proposals would ensure that excessive leakage from the primarycontainment via the weld repair does not exist and would provide a levelof safety at least equivalent to that attained by compliance with sectionIV.A. of appendix J to 10 CFR part 50. On this basis, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associatedwith this proposed exemption. With regard to potential nonradiological impacts, the proposed exemptioninvolves features located entirely within the restricted areas as definedin 10 CFR part 20. It does not affect nonradiological plant effluents andhas not other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant nonradiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed exemption. Alternative to the Proposed Action It has been concluded that there is no measurable impact associated withthe proposed exemption and associated license amendment; any alternativeto the exemption will have either no environmental impact or greater environmentalimpact. Alternative Use of Resources This action involves no use of resources not previously considered in theFinal Environmental Statement (construction permit and operating licensee)for the James A. FitzPatrick Nuclear Power Plant. Agencies and Persons Consulted The NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact </ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed exemption. Based on the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that the proposedaction will not have a significant effect on the quality of the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the request for exemptiondated September 28, 1989, which is available for public inspection at theCommission's Public Document Room, Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, N.W.,Washington, D.C., and at the Penfield Library, State University Collegeof Oswego, Oswego, New York.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Scott A.
