Leaders of the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches in Liverpoolcalled for stronger economic pressure on South Africa, however, ata separate meeting with delegates to the party's annual four-dayconference in this seaside resort 200 miles northwest of London.   Buthelezi praised Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's position onSouth Africa, which supports mild sanctions. He said toughsanctions would not help end apartheid, the government policy ofracial separation.   ``Political propaganda has attempted to establish the myth thatblack South Africans are pro-sanctions and support the politics ofviolent confrontation inside the country,'' he said. ``Nothingcould be further from the truth.''   Buthelezi said money from the European Economic Community wasbeing used to support those who favor of violence in South Africa.He told Britain to stand firm against such support of``revolutionary violence.''   Catholic Archbishop Derek Worlock and Anglican Bishop DavidSheppard, who recently returned from South Africa, said at theseparate meeting that Britain is seen as South Africa's closestally and should step up pressure on its government.   The churchmen spoke for the Southern Africa Coalition, made upof 80 groups campaigning for fundamental change in Britain's policytoward South Africa.   The bishops said in a joint statement: ``This is clearly not themoment to consider any easing of existing pressures.   ``Instead, we are persuaded that further selective, effectiveand targeted measures, chosen in the diplomatic, political andeconomic fields, should be applied progressively. We desire mosturgently to see an end to the evils of apartheid.''</TEXT></DOC>
