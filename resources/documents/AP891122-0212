Fire for Boosting Trade With South Africa</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The General Assembly adopted a resolutionWednesday deploring West Germany's becoming South Africa's leadingtrade partner and criticizing it for allegedly letting theapartheid state obtain blueprints for submarines.   In passing 12 anti-apartheid resolutions, the assembly alsocriticized Chile and Israel for their military trade with thePretoria government.   The United States and Britain voted against most of theresolutions, calling them unbalanced and unconstructive. WesternEuropean nations joined them in opposing some measures.   One resolution passed by consensus supported the right of theSouth African people to reach a negotiated political settlementwith South Africa's government to end racial conflict.   The other resolutions contained more controversial elements.Each received dozens more votes than required for passage, throughthe backing of the more than 100 votes of the non-aligned movement.   Key provisions of the 12 resolutions include:   _A call for all nations to cut off trade, banking, investment,cultural and sports links with South Africa.   _Criticism of West Germany ``which recently emerged as theleading trading partner of South Africa.'' No figures were given,but the United States, Japan and Britain also were high on the list.   _Condemnation of ``the collaboration of Israel with the racistminority regime of South Africa in the military and nuclearfields.'' Israel has been accused of helping Pretoria develop amedium-range missile and nuclear technology that could be used tomake weapons.   _Castigating West Germany, ``which allowed the provision by twocorporations based on its territory to South Africa of blueprintsfor the manufacture of submarines and other related militarymaterial.''   _Criticism of Chile, ``which has become an important outlet forthe sale of South Africa's military hardware.''   _Concern over ``arbitrary detentions and trials, including thoseof woman and children, executions of political prisoners, theongoing use of vigilante groups and the stifling of the press.   _Demands for release of ``all political prisoners and detainees,especially children.''   _Demands for immediate release of Nelson Mandela, the AfricanNational Congress leader serving a life prison term for plottingsabotage.   _Demands for withdrawal of troops from black townships in SouthAfrica.   South Africa's assembly voting rights were suspended in 1974 forfailing to heed calls for the abolition of apartheid.   A West German U.N. representative said his country has preventedany further blueprints from reaching South Africa that would haveprovided information needed to make a submarine operational. TheSouth African navy said in August that it had shelved plans tobuild its own subs.</TEXT></DOC>
