NYC RAID SETS OFF PRIVACY DISPUTE NEW YORK, NEW YORK,U.S.A., 1990 OCT 23 (NB) -- Newsbytes has learned that officers of the NewYork City Queens County District Attorney's office in the investigation ofalleged telephone fraud, has seized a computer bulletin board (BBS), &quot;CCLICode,&quot; located in Bayside, Queens.andM;In response to questions from Newsbytes, Charles Testagrossa, chief of theDistrict Attorney's Office Racket Squad, confirmed that a search warrant had,in fact, been executed at that equipment had been impounded as&quot;instrumentalities of the crime under investigation.&quot; Beyond that,Testagrossa declined to &quot;comment on a case still under investigation.&quot; Fromother informed sources, Newsbytes has learned that the investigation wasbegun after a private company, Star-Tel, brought allegations of telephonefraud against the sysop of the BBS to the attention of the DistrictAttorney's office.andM;This case was originally brought to Newsbytes' attention as a result ofcomplaints made by Eric Corley, editor and publisher of 2600 Magazine: TheHacker Quarterly, concerning the seizing of a bulletin board which Corley hadused for electronic mail.andP;  (At the time of the discussion, Corley was underthe impression that the seizure was a result of an action of the New YorkState Police.) At that time, Corley said: &quot;My private mail has nothing to dowith whatever it is that they are investigating and I greatly resent it beingtaken.andP;  My privacy has been invaded by this action and I am contacting myattorney to determine the appropriate legal action to be taken.&quot;andM;Newsbytes has since contacted various law enforcement officials familiar withthe procedures concerning the executions of search warrants and has been toldthat, under existing statutes, all of the data on an impounded hard disk maybe examined.andP;  If, during the examination, data on the disk indicates possiblecriminal actions by any person, whether a subject of the originalinvestigation or not, that information may be used against the person.andP;  It isalso, Newsbytes was told, not necessary that the criminal activity suggestedby information on the disk have anything to do with the originalinvestigation.andM;Gail Thackeray, Assistant Attorney General of the State of Arizona, toldNewsbytes that it could be somewhat more complicated than stated above.andP;  &quot;Thequestion that Mr. Corley raises concerning the privacy of e-mail is veryinteresting.andP;  While the law is fairly clear in most jurisdictions concerningseizure of evidence, the specific procedures to be used may not have been clearly defined.andP;  This is not really surprising; in the case of wire tapping,it took 20 years to work out the proper procedures.andP;  What may be hard for thecourts to decide relating to e-mail is the rights of third parties in acriminal case.andP;  Both the defendant and the prosecution have the right to havethe original evidence maintained exactly as it was when it was impounded.andO;These rights may run counter to those of third parties who may wish theirprivate material removed from the evidence.andP;  It will be interesting to seeexactly what the courts say on these matters.&quot; Thackeray also pointed outthat there are presently some civil cases in progress concerning the privacyof e-mail and that decisions in those cases may have a bearing on thestanding of e-mail in criminal actions.andM;In a later conversation with Newsbytes, Corley reiterated his contention thatsuch activities are a violation of privacy and said that he has been toldthat there are existing legal actions to support his position in progress.andO;He also stated that he hoped that the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)will take an active interest in this issue.andM;(Barbara E.
