An official for the San Francisco-based apparel manufacturer said a majority of the debtholders must approve the proposal before it can take effect. Levi said the share repurchase is a means of giving additional liquidity to common shareholders, who are largely descendants of the company's founding family.    Those holders had anticipated a delay of as long as five years before getting any liquidity on their investment, the company said, but because of Levi's &quot;successful efforts to repay its leveraged buy-out debt ahead of schedule,&quot; that date could move up.    The spokesman said there aren't any current plans for Levi to go public again. </TEXT></DOC>
