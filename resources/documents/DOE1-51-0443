Over thepast year we have continued to maintain a group of excellent graduatestudents working on petrology of dolomites and closely allied topics.The research topics include: (1) U-Th-Pb systematics in Burlington-Keokukcarbonates;(2) Solid inclusions and noncarbonate phases in dolomitesof the Burlington-Keokuk FMS;(3) Porosity and permeability in dolomitesof Burlington-Keokuk FMS;(4) X-ray microprobe analysis of trace elementsusing synchroton radiation;(5) Dolomitization of Devonian reef complexesin Canning Basin, Western Australia;(6) Quantitative modeling of majorand trace elements and isotopes during carbonate diagenesis;(7) Modelingof regional fluid flow;and (8) Stable isotope geochemistry and cathodeluminescence of crinoids from the Burlington-Keokuk FMS.</TEXT></DOC>
