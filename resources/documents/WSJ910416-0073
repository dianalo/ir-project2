President Bush called on both sides to avoid a strike,using recommendations issued in January by a presidentialemergency board as the basis for agreement. In the midst ofthe Persian Gulf war, both sides in February agreed to putoff any strike until midnight tonight. The president saidyesterday that a strike &quot;could severely disrupt the economyjust as the economy in our view is trying to turn around andget out of this recession.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   A strike, which would be the first nationwide rail strikesince the three-day stoppage in 1982, would idle about200,000 rail employees. It also would affect about 100,000commuters, mostly in the Chicago area. Mr. Bush yesterdaysaid the rail industry moves more than one-third of allshipped U.S. goods, and the administration has said it wouldsupport legislation to avert a strike.   The White House recently urged Rep. John Dingell (D.,Mich.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,to move for legislation that would adopt the boardrecommendations to head off the strike, union officials said.Railroads would look more favorably on such legislation thanthe operating-craft unions, which bitterly oppose the report.   Mr. Dingell has suggested he'll hold hearings on therail-labor dispute soon after a strike begins, but hasn'tindicated whether he'll push for legislation.   Congress could move swiftly this week to end any walkoutby enacting the emergency board's report into law. But unlikethe prevailing situation in many past rail-labor standoffs,such action would anger the Democratic majority's unionallies.   While some unions have reached tentative settlements withtheir employers, the United Transportation Union, theBrotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, and the Brotherhood ofMaintenance of Way Employees, in particular, regard theboard's report as opening the way for sizable crew cuts,increases in required mileage and, in effect, pay cuts.Imposing the recommendations &quot;would create an onerousburden,&quot; said Mac Fleming, president of the Maintenance ofWay Employees.   Three unions, the Transportation Communications Union, theBrotherhood of Railway Signalmen and the American TrainDispatchers Association, have reached tentative agreements.Eight others are still at odds with the railroads.   Over the weekend, Joshua Javits, chairman of the NationalMediation Board, called the eight unions and the railroadsinto mediated bargaining sessions. Those negotiationscontinued yesterday.   Meanwhile, union chiefs also met with TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner yesterday, trying to resolve thenegotiating problems, but little progress was made,Transportation Department officials said.   If a strike cannot be averted, the administration intendsto work with Congress to quickly draft &quot;appropriatelegislation&quot; to end a work stoppage, White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said.   Freight shippers generally expect a rail strike to lastonly a day or two before Congress calls unionized railemployees back to work. &quot;I think we will be out Wednesday andThursday, and we can live with that,&quot; says Anthony J. Skul,director of transportation at CF Industries, a Long Grove,Ill., fertilizer maker and distributor. &quot;A rail strike wouldhave to go four or five days before it shut our plants down,&quot;he says.   Shippers of lumber, paper and chemicals have boosted railshipments in the past week in anticipation of a strike, andelectric utilities have been building inventories of coal forweeks.   But some shippers, particularly food and auto producers,that depend on time-sensitive freight transport are alreadyswitching loads to trucks, giving truckers some benefits fromthe anticipated rail strike.   The automobile industry anticipates widespread plantshutdowns if a rail strike lasts more than a couple of days.&quot;A rail strike would shut down the auto industry within a fewdays because of the high percentage of rail shipmentscarrying assembly parts,&quot; said Stanley Brown, director of thetraffic department at the Motor Vehicle ManufacturersAssociation. Auto makers have been insisting that deliveriesbe made just-in-time.   Commuter authorities said they expect a rail strike todisrupt those passenger trains operating on the tracks offreight railroads. That's less of a concern around New YorkCity where most commuter trains operate on tracks owned andmaintained by the mass transit authorities. But ChristopherKnapton, a spokesman for Metra, the commuter rail system inNortheast Illinois, said that if a rail strike occurs,&quot;Chicago will have 75,000 people looking for another way toget to work.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
