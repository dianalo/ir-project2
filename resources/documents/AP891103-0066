In Hong Kong, an independent newspaper reported that Chineseauthorities have complied a new wanted list of dissidents. Itreportedly includes Chai Ling, a key figure in the protests, aswell as other students and intellectuals.   At Beijing University, students were told at several officiallysponsored rallies this week that they should cooperate withinvestigators who would come to question them, said the sources,who spoke on condition of anonymity.   An official of the university's Foreign Affairs Office todaydenied that any such rallies had taken place or that investigatorshad come onto campus.   Beijing University students were at the forefront of the massprotests that were crushed when the Chinese army shot throughcrowds of unarmed demonstrators in the capital, leaving hundredsand possibly thousands dead.   Thousands more were arrested, including Beijing Universityfreshman Wang Dan, one of the driving forces behind the students'occupation of Beijing's Tiananmen Square.   Beijing University is considered China's most prestigious andpolitically active school.   The crackdown on the protest movement has increased tension oncampus this year. Some upperclassmen did not return after summerbreak, apparently either because they were arrested or feared theywould be.   There also are no freshmen on campus this year. The enteringclass was slashed from 2,100 to 800, then shipped off for a year ofarmy training and political indoctrination at a military academysouthwest of Beijing.   Classes at the university, originally scheduled to begin Aug.29, were delayed until Oct. 14 to avoid unrest on Oct. 1, orNational Day, which marks the 40th anniversary of Communist China,students said.   Hao Bin, the Communist Party vice secretary at the university,summoned students in groups to hourlong rallies this week at thecampus' 2,000-seat auditorium, the university sources said.   He told them to cooperate with investigators and urged them toconfess if they had done any significant ``bad things,'' said oneuniversity source.   Hao, a hard-liner believed to have served as a political officerwith the People's Liberation Army, was quoted as telling studentsthere were several types of people who must turn themselves in.   They included leaders of student organizations involved in theprotests and those who attacked soldiers, spread rumors toforeigners or divulged secrets, the source said.   One student was questioned about a contribution of more than$2,500 to the student movement from workers at a governmentministry, another source at the university said.   In Hong Kong, the independent Chinese-language Ming Paonewspaper printed a copy of what it described as an official listof seven wanted dissidents put out last month by the Ministry ofPublic Security.   Such a document suggests that the dissidents were still at large.   Among the three most prominent student leaders of the TiananmenSquare demonstrations, Chai is the only one whose fate has remainedsince the crackdown began.   One leader, Wu'er Kaixi, fled to the West. The third was Wang,the freshman who was captured by Chinese authorities in Beijing.   Chai, a 23-year-old native of Shandong province who was agraduate student in the Department of Psychology at Beijing NormalUniversity, assumed the title of commander of the Headquarters toDefend Tiananmen Square before the crackdown.   Soon after the military assault, she went into hiding andrecorded an emotional account of the military onslaught. It wassmuggled out of China and broadcast in Hong Kong.</TEXT></DOC>
