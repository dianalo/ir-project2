These devices are      generally characterized by a transition from substantial transparency      below the characteristic transition temperature to substantial opacity      above that temperature, at all wavelengths. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the teachings of copending application Ser. No.      07/172,119, which teachings are incorporated herein by reference, an      optical filter structure was described for selectively blocking radiation      of predetermined wavelength comprising a layer of material characterized      by transition from non-metal to metal, corresponding to a change from      transmissive to reflective states upon being heated to a characteristic      transition temperature, deposited on a slab of dielectric material in the      form of a plurality of multipole elements in an array of predetermined      spacing between adjacent rows and columns of the array. The filter of the      07/172,119 application is characterized by substantial transparency to all      radiation wavelengths below its characteristic transition temperature, and      opacity only to the predetermined wavelength, and substantial transparency      to all other wavelengths, above the transition temperature, and is      constructed by applying a film of thermal switching material in the form      of an array of microwave-type multipole elements of optical dimensions,      the film being applied to a dielectric slab, or sandwiched between two      dielectric slabs. </PAR><PAR>  For purposes of describing the invention and defining the scope thereof,      the term &quot;optical&quot; shall, in accordance with the customary usage, be      defined herein to include only ultraviolet, visible, near infrared,      mid-infrared and far infrared regions of the electromagnetic spectrum      lying between about 0.1 to about 1000 microns (see e.g. Optical Physics,      by Max Garbuny, Academic Press, New York, 1965, pp 1-6), and more      specifically to the range of from about 0.2 micron, the approximate lower      limit of operation of fine quality quartz lenses (Garbuny, p 280), to      about 50 microns, the approximate upper limit of operation of long      wavelength transmitting material such as KRS-5 (thallium bromide-iodide      ionic crystal) (Garbuny, p 282). </PAR><PAR>  The invention provides a substantially improved optical reflection band      filter capable of actively or passively sweeping a preselected range of      wavelengths and locking in on a wavelength within that range to      effectively block that wavelength while substantially passing all others.      It is noted that, in addition to the preselected wavelength sought to be      blocked, a basic resonant wavelength corresponding to the overall size of      the elements may also be blocked. The invention is constructed by      depositing a periodic array of microlithographic patterns of conducting      metal in the form of microwave antenna type multipole elements of optical      dimensions, preselected according to a desired characteristic wavelength      range to be swept. The metallic elements comprise small spaced-apart metal      segments interconnected by sections of superconducting-to-insulator phase      transition materials deposited in the spaces between adjacent metallic      segments. Each successive phase transition section from the center of each      pattern outwardly has predetermined lesser thickness than the next      inwardly situated transition section. Upon heating the array by a      controllable heater contacting the filter or by impinging laser radiation,      the interconnection sections switch from superconducting to insulating at      different temperatures or at different heating rates for each set of      interconnections, providing wavelength sweeping over the characteristic      preselected wavelength reflection band. The invention is therefore a      substantial improvement over the totally opaque switching reflection      filter, the non-switching metallic element array reflection-band filter,      the fixed wavelength switching element reflection band filter, and other      wavelength responsive laser hardening devices. </PAR><PAR>  It is therefore a principal object of the invention to provide an improved      optical filter. </PAR><PAR>  It is a further object of the invention to provide an optical filter for      selectively blocking laser radiation of particular wavelength while      passing radiation of other wavelengths. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a switchable filter      incorporating insulating-to-superconducting materials to provide selective      wavelength filtering. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet another object of the invention to provide an optical filter      having fast response time. </PAR><PAR>  It is yet a further object of the invention to provide a filter capable of      sweeping a reflection band to reflect a preselected wavelength within that      band. </PAR><PAR>  These and other objects of the invention will become apparent as the      detailed description of representative embodiment proceeds. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In accordance with the foregoing principles and objects of the invention,      an optical reflection band filter structure for selectively blocking      radiation within a preselected range of wavelengths is described which      comprises a plurality of multipole elements of preselected configuration      deposited with prescribed spacing of optical dimensions in a periodic      array on a substrate of dielectric material, each multipole configuration      comprising a central element of metal and having shape corresponding to      the overall shape of the multipole and a plurality of spaced metal      segments, each space between adjacent segments being filled with a segment      of material characterized by transition from superconducting phase to      insulating phase upon being heated to a characteristic transition      temperature, each transition segment disposed outwardly from the center of      the multipole element having smaller thickness than, or different      composition from, the next inwardly disposed transition segment, the      innermost transition segments having thickness substantially equal to that      of the metal segments and the central element. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed      description of representative embodiments thereof read in conjunction with      the accompanying drawings wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a fragmentary view in section of a layered structure      representative of the optical filter of the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a layered structure incorporating an array      of crossed dipoles according to the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a layered structure incorporating an array      of tripoles according to the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a plan view of a crossed dipole element structured according to      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a sectional view of the element of FIG. 4 taken along lines E--E;      and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a plan view of a tripole element structured according to the      invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 1-3, shown therein are layered structures including      dipole and tripole elements and representative of arrays which may be      deposited according to the teachings of the invention. As shown in FIG. 1,      a reflection filter 10 of the invention may comprise a layer 11 of an      array of elements deposited in predetermined pattern and spacing as herein      described on a supporting substrate 12 of dielectric material. A second      slab or layer 13 of dielectric material may be applied over layer 11 to      form the sandwich structure shown, if desired. Dielectric substrate 12 or      slab 13 may include semiconductors, ionic crystals, covalent crystals,      glasses, polycrystalline materials, amorphous materials, polymers and      other organic materials, all generally characterized as transparent      insulators or semiconductors, substantially transparent to optical      wavelengths in the range from about 0.2 to 50.0 microns. </PAR><PAR>  Layer 11 comprises a periodic array of microwave antenna type multipole      elements of novel structure deposited on substrate 12. As shown in FIG. 2      and 3, layers 21, 31 comprising representative arrays of multipole      elements of respective filters 20, 30 may comprise a rectilinear, square      array of crossed dipoles 24 or tripoles 34, respectively deposited on      substrates 22, 32 of substantially transparent dielectric material of      dielectric constant .epsilon..sub.2, and covered by optional slabs 22, 33      of dielectric material of dielectric constant .epsilon..sub.2. Layers 21,      31 of filters 20, 30 may be otherwise configured, within the scope of      these teachings, in other geometric forms, and may include single dipoles,      grids, crosses, circles, and staggered multipole patterns as might occur      to one with skill in the field of the invention. Further, selected      multipole patterns may be deposited to any desired thickness as      appropriate, in any periodic array and orientation with respect to each      other, within the contemplation of the teachings herein, as to define a      hexagonal, diamond, circular or other desired pattern as a particular      application requires. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 4 and 5, shown therein are a plan view of a      representative multipole element of the invention in the form of a crossed      dipole element 41, and a sectional view of element 41 taken along line      E--E. Referring specifically to FIG. 4, element 41 comprises a crossed      pattern of plurality of conducting metal segments 42 and a central      cross-shaped conducting metallic element 43. Central element 43 has a      shape (a cross in FIG. 4) corresponding to the overall shape of the      multipole element. Metallic segments 42 and central element 43 are of      preselected length l, width w, spacing a, and substantially uniform      thickness and may be deposited on dielectric substrate 44 (FIG. 5) using      known deposition techniques including x-ray, electron beam or ion beam      lithography, photolithography, or other appropriate technique known in the      relevant art. Metals suitable herein for comprising metal segments 42 and      central element 43 include aluminum, gold, copper, tin, nickel, as would      occur to one with skill in the applicable art. In a preferred embodiment      of the invention, metal segments 42 and central element 43 comprised      aluminum and were of equal lengths. Between adjacent segments 42 and      between central element 43 and surrounding metal segments 42 are gaps 45      of preselected, substantially equal widths a. </PAR><PAR>  The structure of each multiple element such as represented by dipole      element 41 of FIGS. 4 and 5 is completed by depositing into each gap 45      segments 46 interconnecting adjacent metal segments 42 and comprising a      material which undergoes a superconducting-to-insulating phase transition      upon being heated to a characteristic transition temperature T.sub.c.      Suitable material for segments 46 include, but are not necessarily limited      to, ceramics such as the Ba-La-Cu-O system including Ba.sub.x La.sub.5-x      Cu.sub.5 O.sub.5(3-y), Ba.sub.x La.sub.1-x CuO.sub.3-y, and Ba.sub.x      La.sub.2-x CuO.sub.4-y ; the Sr-La-Cu-O system including Sr.sub.x      La.sub.2-x CuO.sub.4-y and (Sr.sub.x La.sub.1-x).sub.2 CuO.sub.4-x ; the      Y-Ba-Cu-O system including YBa.sub.2 Cu.sub.3 O.sub.9-y and Y.sub.0.87      Ba.sub.1.53 Cu.sub.3 O.sub.y ; the Ba-Sr-La-Cu-O system including      (Ba,Sr).sub.x La.sub.2-x CuO.sub.4-y ; the La-Cu-O system including      La.sub.2 CuO.sub.4 ; and the Ba-Pb-Bi-O system including BaPb.sub.1-x      Bi.sub.x O.sub.3, and organic semiconductors such as copper-doped,      silver-doped or golddoped tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ),      Insulating-to-superconducting transition temperatures T.sub.c range from      about 0.3.degree. to 120.degree.  K. Segments 46 of transition material      may be deposited using substantially standard lithography techniques such      as those mentioned above for metal segments 42 and central element 43,      x-ray lithography being preferred method as offering optimum resolution. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 6 shown therein is a plan view of another      representative multipole element of the invention in the form of tripole      61. Tripole 61 comprises a preselected plurality of metal segments 62 and      central element 63 (again, having shape corresponding to that of tripole      61), gaps 65 and segments 66 all of predetermined dimensions and deposited      in manner corresponding to that characterizing dipole element 41 of the      FIG. 4 embodiment. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIG. 5, each segment 46a, b of crossed dipole element 41      (or 66a, b of tripole 61 of FIG. 6) has a thickness depending on its      position from the center of element 41. Segment 46a has predetermined      thickness substantially equal to that of adjoining metal segments 43 and      42 and greater than that of segment 46b, and as discussed below, the      temporal switching of segments differ slightly according to their      respective thicknesses, the thinner segments switching faster under      constant heat input. In a multipole structure of the invention comprising      a number of metal segments 42 or 62 greater than that depicted in FIG. 4      or 6, each radially outwardly positioned segment 46 or 66 has thickness      smaller than the next radially inwardly disposed segment 46 or 66 with the      innermost disposed segment preferably having thickness corresponding to      metal segments 43 and 42, each segment 46 or 66 having a transition rate      corresponding to its thickness. </PAR><PAR>  An alternative structure to those described above for varying the      transition temperatures of the element segment includes element segments      comprising different materials or otherwise characterized different      critical temperatures. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now again to FIGS. 2 and 3, the crossed dipoles 24 of layer 21 of      FIG. 2 lie in the x-z plane coincident with layer 21. Dipoles 24 are      separated by distances of optical dimensions designated by D.sub.x between      adjacent columns and D.sub.z between adjacent rows and have predetermined      overall length L.sub.D and width w. Dielectric substrate 22 has thickness      D.sub.2 and dielectric constant .crclbar..sub.2, and slab 23 has thickness      D.sub.1 and dielectric constant .epsilon..sub.1, and each are preferably      transparent to radiation over substantially all wavelengths of interest.      Therefore, light traveling, for example, along the y coordinate impinges      first upon dielectric 23. The area of each crossed dipole is given by      2wL.sub.D and the fractional cross-sectional area R.sub.d occupied by the      crossed dipoles 24 may be expressed as, </PAR><EQU>  R.sub.d andequals; 2wL.sub.D /D.sub.x D.sub.z                       (1) </EQU><PAL>  For the configuration of FIG. 3 comprising tripoles 34, a similar analysis      applies. Referring now to FIG. 3, the area of each tripole 34 may be      expressed as 3wL.sub.T /2, and the fractional cross-section between      R.sub.t occupied by the tripoles 34 may be expressed as. </PAL><EQU>  R.sub.t andequals; 3wL.sub.T /2D.sub.x D.sub.z                      (2) </EQU><PAL>  Similar analyses may be performed to obtain equivalent expressions for R      for multipole elements in other configurations. </PAL><PAR>  At a temperature above the highest critical temperature of the respective      segments 46 or 66, the filter has a reflection band characteristic of the      length l and spacing a of the metal segments. The relationship with the      central wavelength .lambda..sub.1 of the reflection band for a crossed      dipole (and single dipole) element is approximated by, </PAR><EQU>  l .congruent.0.5 (.lambda..sub.1 /N.sub.eff)               (3) </EQU><PAL>  and for the central tripole element by, </PAL><EQU>  l.sub.T .congruent.0.55 (.lambda..sub.1 /N.sub.eff)        (4) </EQU><PAL>  where N.sub.eff is the effective index of refraction given by,      ##EQU1##      where each respective dielectric constant is effectively equal to the      square of the corresponding material refractive index. Thus, the range of      the product of element length times effective refractive index may lie in      the range of from about 0.1 micron to about 25 microns. The length of the      metal segments is chosen so that .lambda..sub.1 is located on the short      wavelength side of the operational wavelength range .lambda..sub.a to      .lambda..sub.b of the protected optical system, i.e., </PAL><EQU>  .lambda..sub.1 andlt; .lambda..sub.a.                           (6) </EQU><PAL>  Additional reflection losses within the operational wavelength range are      small and can be overcome by antireflection coatings. In the case of      tripoles, the resonance of the central segment is given by Eq (4) but the      resonance of the additional segments is still given by Eq (3). The segment      length must be chosen to give an additional common resonance at      .lambda..sub.1. </PAL><PAR>  To further understand how the filter operates consider the case in which      the interconnections between the element segments are cooled until the      innermost interconnections switch at a temperature T.sub.c ; for example,      T.sub.c is about 85.degree. K. for the new high-temperature      superconducting materials. At a temperature equal to or greater than      T.sub.c, the resonance is now determined by elements composed of three      segments plus the innermost interconnections. If the length of the      interconnections is .DELTA., the resonance condition for crossed dipoles      is now,      ##EQU2##      and for tripoles;      ##EQU3##      where .lambda..sub.2 lies within the optical system operational wavelength      range .lambda..sub.a to .lambda..sub.b ; i.e., </PAR><EQU>  .lambda..sub.a andlt; .lambda..sub.2 andlt; .lambda..sub.b           (9) </EQU><PAL>  If the reflection band centered about .lambda..sub.2 coincides with an      invasive wavelength .lambda..sub.0, the filter will successfully reflect      the invasive laser radiation. Otherwise the substrate must be further      cooled until the second set of interconnections is switched. The process      may be continued to any degree desired, depending upon the length and      number of segments and interconnections. The general resonance condition      for crossed dipoles will be,      ##EQU4##      and for tripoles,      ##EQU5##      where .lambda..sub.a andlt; .lambda..sub.J andlt;.lambda..sub.b ; Jandgt;1.(12) </PAL><PAR>  The periodic array of antenna elements will produce a moderately narrow      reflection band from about 93% to about 97% reflectivity about a central      wavelength .lambda..sub.J. The calculation of the peak value of the      reflection band is complex and can be evaluated numerically, and the final      fine tuning of the reflection band is normally an empirical process, the      details of which are not disclosed herein. </PAR><PAR>  Assume the maximum continuous length of all metal and transition segments      in the metallic state at a given temperature in a crossed dipole element      41 to be L.sub.D and the corresponding tripole 61 length is L.sub.T. The      corresponding resonant wavelength is labeled .lambda..sub.max. L.sub.D      L.sub.T being given, the other dimensions of the multipole are selected.      The spacing between rows and columns is kept below .lambda..sub.max /2 to      avoid grating lobes, but the spacing must be large enough that adjacent      elements do not touch. A best estimate of minimum spacing may be a value      greater than about one-tenth the length of the elements (i.e., about      one-twentieth the design wavelength). In most cases this implies, </PAR><EQU>  D.sub.x andequals; D.sub.z .congruent. L.sub.D or L.sub.T           (13) </EQU><PAL>  The size of w affects the width of the reflection band, which is a function      of w/l. The exact mathematical dependence is exceedingly complicated, but      the reflection bandwidth increases with element width. The element width      parameter is best determined empirically, a major consideration being the      transmission required within the system operational wavelength band      .lambda..sub.a to .lambda..sub.b and at temperatures above T.sub.c, as      governed by Eqs (1) and (2). </PAL><PAR>  Consider as an example that a filter of the crossed dipole array      configuration of FIGS 2, 4 and 5 is required to operate in the 3-14 micron      range. A dielectric slab 22 of ZnS (refraction index andequals; 2.25) may be      selected. Assume no covering slab 23 is used (i.e., .epsilon..sub.1 andequals;      1.0). From Eq (5),      ##EQU6##      Assume laser radiation at 5.8 microns and 10.0 microns is to be blocked      when all interconnections are switched. The length l of the metallic      elements (e.g., aluminum) may be chosen to be three times the length a of      the transition material interconnections. Eq (10) gives,      ##EQU7##      or a andequals; 0.151 microns, and l andequals; 3a andequals; 0.453 microns. With only innermost      interconnections switched, the reasonance condition becomes      ##EQU8##      The resonance of the unswitched arrays is      ##EQU9##      which lies outside the operational range of the optical system sought to      be protected from incoming laser radiation. Letting </PAR><EQU>  D.sub.x andequals;D.sub.z andequals; 20a andequals;3.02 microns, </EQU><PAL>  satisfies the requirement that D.sub.x and D.sub.z are less than      .lambda..sub.0 /2 and ensures that the elements 24 in adjacent rows and      columns do not touch. The value of w is determined empirically to obtain      the desired bandwidth, but some limitations are imposed by the inband      absorption to be tolerated below the transition temperature. For w andequals;0.2      micron, the absorption Ab calculated from the expression of Eq (1) for Rd      is,      ##EQU10##      or about 13%. Thus, a trade-off is to be made among the bandwidth, the      transmission of the unswitched state filter, and the limitations of      present lithographic techniques. </PAL><PAR>  In the representative embodiments of the reflection filter of the invention      as shown in FIGS. 2-6, the filter is configured to have a characteristic      optical reflection band which includes a range of anticipated wavelengths      of an incident radiation beam, such as of an invasive laser beam. As the      filter is heated by the invasive radiation, selected transition material      segments transistion from superconducting to insulating phase, thereby      passively sweeping its characteristic reflection band until it locks onto      the specific invasive wavelength .lambda..sub.0. </PAR><PAR>  The substrate is placed within a cryogenic cooler but locally is actively      heated, as by heater 15, and its temperature controlled by any of various      methods. For example, substrate 12 may itself be used as a heater with      appropriate electric leads attached to substrate 12; in this example it is      desirable for substrate 12 to be a semiconductor. Alternatively, a      transparent and electrically conducting layer 16 of tin oxide or      equivalent material may be disposed on substrate 12, as suggested in FIG.      1, with appropriate electrical leads attached near the edge of the      substrate. In another embodiment, layer 16 may comprise a grid of      resistive metal wire (e.g., nichrome), the grid dimensions being selected      to avoid diffraction effects which may interfere with the antenna pattern      operation characterizing the filter of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  As a further embodiment of the invention, the central wavelength of the      reflection band may also be passively varied by the heating or electrical      field of impinging laser radiation. In this case the filter is maintained      at a temperature slightly below T.sub.c, causing all interconnections to      be in a superconducting state, and the filter reflection band located at      the longest wavelength position. As more heat is added to the filter, the      interconnecting elements progressively switch from the outermost to      innermost, until the filter locks on to the laser wavelength at      .lambda..sub.0. </PAR><PAR>  The invention therefore provides an optical reflection band filter device      for actively or passively sweeping a preselected reflection wavelength      band to block preselected discrete, tunable wavelengths within that band      while passing substantially all other wavelengths. The response of the      filter is wavelength independent prior to switching, and absorption losses      (less than about 10-13% due mostly to the geometry of the array elements)      are minimized due to the switching mechanism which characterizes filter      operation. Because of the small thermal mass and thermal isolation of the      transition segments, the filter has a time constant for switching      substantially faster than that for existing devices characterized by      opaque switching or by fixed wavelength switching, may comprise optical      substrates configured in substantially any size and shape, and may be      effective in its function at angles of incidence of impinging radiation up      to about 80.degree. from normal. The invention may therefore find      substantial use as a protective optical filter against laser weapons. </PAR><PAR>  It is understood that modifications to the invention may be made as might      occur to one with skill in the field of the invention within the scope of      the appended claims. All embodiments contemplated hereunder which achieve      the objects of the invention have therefore not been shown in complete      detail.
