(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Residents are complaining that thecleanup of chemicals like nerve gas and mustard gas from a federalSuperfund site is giving them headaches, runny eyes, respiratoryproblems and nausea.   The cleanup began in July at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal, part ofwhich was used from 1957 to 1980 as a reservoir for the Army'schemical weapons program and Shell Oil Co.'s pesticide-manufacturingoperation.   During the cleanup process, gases are being released from thecontaminated soil. Easterly winds carry the gases over Irondale,which just north of Commerce City and about 10 miles northeast ofDenver.   Residents say the fumes from the cleanup on some days hang overCommerce City like a fog.   Mary Daigle, a resident of the Irondale mobile home park, sayslong-term effects on her health are unknown.   ``I am glad they are cleaning it (the arsenal) up,'' Daigle said.``But I don't think the people that live around it should pay for itwith their health.''   The nearly 45 families living in the mobile home park are about amile west of Basin F in the arsenal's northwest corner. The cleanupis centered in Basin F.   ``It's a terrible odor,'' said Irondale resident Erwin Rice, whohas lived there since 1980. ``It smells more like insecticide.''   Rice said his father, who had lived in the mobile home since1974, died of cancer in 1983.   Colorado Department of Health officials will begin visitingarsenal neighbors to try to track the effects of airborne pollution.   Connally Mears, the Environmental Protection Agency's coordinatorfor the arsenal cleanup, said residents will be asked about theirhealth backgrounds and about their exposure to any other hazardoussubstances, including tobacco.   Nurses are expected to survey 30 to 40 families. The results willbe sent to the Rocky Mountain Poison Center for analysis.   The situation also has drawn the attention of the nationalCenters for Disease Control in Atlanta, which will try to determinepotential health risks posed by the estimated 20 chemicals in BasinF.</TEXT></DOC>
