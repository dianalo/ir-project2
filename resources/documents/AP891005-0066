Members of the left-leaning Labor Party headed by Vice PremierShimon Peres proposed accepting Egypt's suggestions, Israel Armyradio reported. But ministers of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir'sright-wing Likud bloc reportedly objected. Shamir was expected toresume the debate Friday.   Meanwhile, Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Stripbegan a two-day general strike today in solidarity with Arabsrefusing to pay taxes as part of their nearly 22-month-oldrebellion against Israeli rule.   Soldiers shot to death a 20-year-old protester during a clashwith Palestinian stone- and bottle-throwers, the army said. Fouryouths were reported wounded in separate incidents in the occupiedlands.   Arab reports said a 55-year-old Arab man was found stabbed todeath in Gaza City, and slogans spray-painted on walls nearbyaccused him of collaborating with Israel.   The fatalities raised to 584 the number of Palestinians who havebeen killed by Israelis during the uprising, and to 127 the numberof Arabs killed by Palestinians as suspected collaborators withIsrael.   The six-hour Cabinet session reportedly centered on a proposalby U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker to host talks betweenIsrael and Egypt over the composition of a Palestinian delegationfor peace negotiations.   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak wants negotiations held inCairo.   Baker's idea was raised by Foreign Minister Moshe Arens ofLikud, who returned Wednesday after holding a series of meetingswith U.S. and Egyptian leaders in New York and Washington.   Arens reportedly recommended that the Cabinet support Baker'sidea, but the meeting broke up after he met stiff opposition fromLikud hard-liners, led by Industry Minister Ariel Sharon.   Sharon was quoted as demanding that Arens show the ministers theminutes of his meeting with Baker, and Labor ministers thenrecommended they recess until Friday for Arens to bring the notes.   The Labor ministers reportedly presented a proposal they drew upWednesday night to adopt Mubarak's call for Israeli-Palestiniantalks.   The Egyptian ambassador to Israel, Mohammed Bassiouny, saidtoday that an Egyptian-Israeli summit would depend on Israel'sacceptance of participation by Palestinians deported from the WestBank and Gaza by Israel or other former residents of theterritories.   ``Without Palestinians from outside, it will never work,''Bassiouny told The Associated Press.   Egypt was offering to negotiate with Israel and the UnitedStates on the principles of who should be included in thePalestinian delegation, not on the specific delegates, which wasthe responsibility of the PLO, Bassiouny said.   Likud leaders opposed that.   ``The Egyptian plan in its current version speaks of leading usinto talks with a PLO delegation so it must be rejected,''Transport Minister Moshe Katsav of Likud said on Israel radio,during a break in the meeting.   Israel says the Palestine Liberation Organization is a terroristorganization and refuses to negotiate with it.   Yossi Ahimier, spokesman for Shamir, said the Likud ministersunited behind a Shamir proposal to refuse any contacts with the PLO.   He added that Likud members ``accept it generally that the primeminister will be in contact with the Americans and will hear theirproposals and we will judge later on what is good for us, what wecan adopt and what not.''   Shamir and his allies have said that they would hold talks witha Palestinian delegation approved by Israel, but the two sideswould only discuss procedures for holding elections in the disputedlands.   Elections in the territories are a key element of the Israeligovernment peace initiative announced in April.   The vote is meant to choose representatives to negotiate withIsrael on an interim five-year period of self-rule for 1.7 millionPalestinians who live in these lands. The final status of theterritories would be decided later.</TEXT></DOC>
