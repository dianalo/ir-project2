The cause of death was not immediately known.   MacLennan is best known for his 1945 novel ``Two Solitudes,''which became a byword for the strains between French andEnglish-speaking Canadians, although that was not its originalconnotation.   The son of a Nova Scotia doctor, he studied at DalhousieUniversity, Oxford and Princeton. The Rhodes scholar came toMontreal in 1935 to teach classics at Lower Canada College andjoined McGill University's English department in 1951. He retiredfrom McGill in 1981.   MacLennan stopped writing in 1984 with his last novel, ``Voicesin Time.'' His first published novel, ``Barometer Rising,'' cameout in 1941, followed by ``The Precipice,' ``The Watch That Endsthe Night'' and ``Return of the Sphinx.''   MacLennan was awarded Canada's Governor-General award threetimes for fiction and twice for nonfiction - more than any otherwriter.   Jack McClelland, former head of the McClelland and Stewartpublishing firm in Toronto, said MacLennan was the most importantnovelist in Canada.   ``He was a stylist. He had great depth of understanding of ourcountry as a whole. He was, as an individual, thoughtful, with anextraordinary sense of humor and wit. He was really a lovelyperson.''   MacLennan is survived by his second wife, Frances, and by asister in Halifax.</TEXT></DOC>
