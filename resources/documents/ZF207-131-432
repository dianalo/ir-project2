Social Security AdministrationStandardsProtocol.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Standard Protocols Give SSAnet Room to GrowandM;If the Social Security Administration's agencywide data network has the lookand feel of an IBM Corp. communications environment, it is because agencyofficials planned it that way.andM;SSAnet links 1,304 field offices and six program service centers to thecomplex of IBM and plug-compatible mainframes and 1.3 terabytes ofdirect-access storage devices housed at the National Computer Center.andM;SSAnet's predecessor, the Social Security Administration Data Acquisition andRetrieval System (SSADARS), served the agency from the early 1970s until themid-1980s, but suffered from non-standard protocols and equipment engineeredonly for SSA.andM;The new network follows IBM's Systems Network Architecture.andP;  &quot;As part of the1982-1988 Systems Modernization Plan, we recognized that we needed tomodernize our telecommunications vehicle as well as build on a standardizedprotocol to have the flexibility to grow and interface to other networks,&quot;said Martin E. Baer, who heads the agency's Office of Computer ProcessingOperations.andM;&quot;A major decision the agency made in its data communications utility (DCU)program was to embrace IBM's SNA.andP;  With that foundation block, we built uponIBM 3270 equipment and IBM-compatible services.&quot;andM;Today some 25,000 terminals and 7,700 printers around the country communicatewith host computers via 3174 controllers that interface to 9.6-kilobit/secmultidrop circuits, linking users to one of six remote DCU nodes.andM;From the nodes, the communications path goes through a technical controlfacility and an IBM 3725 front-end processor running the IBM AdvancedCommunications Function software, to a fiber-optic and satellite backbonenetwork.andM;About 4,000 Omni Mod 9600 modems from Racal-Milgo, Sunrise, Fla., do thetransmitting.andP;  Altogether, the network includes 11,000 9.6-kilo-bit/sec localleased circuits, also referred to as collector circuits, and 5456-kilobit/sec circuits supplied by Atlanta-based Contel Corp.'s AmericanSatellite Co. subsidiary.andP;  These connect the DCU nodes to the NationalComputer Center.andM;Nodes in New York and Philadelphia have fiber-optic links supplying 1456-kilobit/sec circuits, while four other nodes located in Birmingham, Ala.,andO;Kansas City, Mo., Richmond, Calif., and Chicago communicate with the centervia 40 satellite circuits.andM;The satellite links are backed up by fiber.andM;&quot;Because the availability of our systems is critical and a number of factorscan distort satellite transmission, we have fiber-optic backup in the eventwe lose a satellite link,&quot; Baer said.andM;Of the 26 IBM front-end processors, 12 are at the National Computer Centerand the rest are at network nodes located with SSA's six program servicecenters.andM;These large processing facilities each employ about 2,000 people.andP;  All linkssupport IBM's synchronous data link control protocol.andP;  IBM's mainframe-basedVirtual Telecommunications Access Method software manages the sessions withthe 3270 devices.andM;The network is monitored at the National Computer Center through IBM'sNetView network management system and also remotely from Atlanta by theContel subsidiary.andM;Although data is not encrypted, officials said that Top Secret software fromComputer Associates International Inc., Garden City, N.Y., controls access tocomputers and data files by requiring SSA staff members to use personalidentification numbers (PINs) and passwords.andM;Once inside a system, users are limited by their PINs to certain activities.andO;Security is enhanced by the fact that SSAnet is a closed network with limiteddial-in capability.andM;SSA officials do not see their huge investment in the IBM environment asbeing threatened by the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile(GOSIP), the Federal Information Processing Standard released last August fordata communications in multi-vendor environments.andM;Renato A. DiPentima, associate commissioner for systems design anddevelopment, said products supporting the seven-layer GOSIP reference modellie some time in the future.andP;  Moreover, he said the General AccountingOffice, which frequently has criticized the agency's modernization efforts,&quot;fully supported&quot; SSA's decision to adopt SNA.andM;&quot;I expect IBM will support GOSIP in some way when it's out there and fullyexists,&quot; DiPentima said.andP;  In the meantime, he said, SSA has to rely on proventechnology.andM;Officials termed reliability of the SSA network &quot;outstanding,&quot; pointing outthe rarity of network failures.andP;  SSAnet has five times the capacity and seventimes the speed of SSADARS, they said, yet on a per-character basis SSAnetcosts about 80 percent as much as the old network.andM;SSAnet's trunk circuits cost 59 cents for 1,000 characters sent per second,compared with 12 cents for 1,000 characters sent per second on SSADARS.andM;According to Baer, one easy area of network growth lies in expanding the56-kilobit/sec circuits.andP;  &quot;We can bring up and activate another56-kilobit/sec circuit overnight,&quot; Baer said.andP;  &quot;It simply requires theaddition of a couple of communications boards for satellite transmission.andM;&quot;From the standpoint of the collector or tail circuits, that is a verydynamic operation because offices open, offices close, offices grow andshrink.andP;  So we are continually in a made of adding equipment and takingequipment away.&quot;andM;Two other initiatives may be the replacement of front-end processorsinstalled about three years ago, as well as future SSAnet links to local areanetworks that may be created in the field offices.andM;The field offices have a limited number of stand-alone personal computers,except for pilot locations in Denver and Chicago where PCs have beennetworked into LANs to run office automation applications.andM;Officials said they need to consider SSA's office automation direction beforeinvesting in LAN technology.andP;  However, they do not expect connecting the LANsto the SSAnet to pose a problem.andM;For the time being, SSAnet will not be subordinated to FTS 2000, the GeneralServices Administration program to meet the voice, data and videocommunications needs of federal agencies.andM;&quot;SSAnet, because of the size of its requirements, is a stand-alone network.andO;We anticipate it will be a stand-alone network for the foreseeable futurebecause of the continued growth of SSA's telecommunications requirements,&quot;Baer said.andP;  &quot;We've no argument against FTS, but SSAnet at the present time ischeaper.andP;  This is not a research and development environment.andP;  This is abusiness.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
