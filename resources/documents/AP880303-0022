The shift in tactics also is designed to sidestep a split withinthe Western alliance over how to approach future negotiations onnuclear arms.   President Reagan and leaders of the 15 other North AtlanticTreaty Organization members highlighted the new Western emphasis onnon-nuclear arms by declaring Wednesday their eagerness to open newnegotiations.   ``The conventional imbalance in Europe remains at the core ofEurope's security concerns,'' the NATO leaders said in a jointstatement.   Their aim is to portray the Western alliance as united on animportant aspect of East-West arms control at a time when Moscow isseeking to exploit a split among the U.S. allies on nuclear armsstrategy.   A central message emerging from the NATO summit, which endsThursday, is that the East bloc's numerical superiority in many keycategories of conventional arms _ not the presence of nuclearweapons in Europe _ is the greatest danger to Western security.   ``The most direct threat to our security and to stability inEurope lies in the Soviet Union's massive military presence at alevel exceeding its defense needs,'' Reagan said after Wednesday'smeetings.   The NATO statement said the large Soviet armies ``cast a shadowover the whole of Europe.''   Washington hopes NATO can begin a new set of conventional armsnegotiations with the Soviet Union and its six Warsaw Pact alliesthis fall.   The NATO initiative also shifts the public spotlight away fromWest Germany's dispute with its allies over whether and when toreplace very short-range nuclear weapons with new, more effectiveones. Most of these weapons, if fired, would strike German soil,East or West.   The Brussels summit was aiming to gloss over the German problemby saying in a broader declaration Thursday that talks onshort-range nuclear missiles could be undertaken in conjunctionwith _ but not necessarily at the same time as _ other armsnegotiations.   That leaves open the question of whether NATO should insist thatthe Soviets reduce their conventional forces before the two blocsengage in negotiations to further reduce their nuclear arsenals inEurope.   According to Western estimates, the Warsaw Pact holds about a3-to-1 advantage in numbers of tanks and artillery, although NATOenjoys an edge in some crucial naval forces and in fighter aircraftin Europe.   The new stress on conventional arms, NATO hopes, will steal someof the thunder from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaignto woo the West European public with calls for freeing thecontinent of nuclear arms.   All NATO members agree they must keep some nuclear weapons inEurope to deter a Soviet attack, although they also have fullyendorsed the U.S.-Soviet treaty to eliminate all intermediate-rangenuclear missiles. The more than 400 U.S. INF missiles are based inWestern Europe.   Gorbachev has significantly improved his public image in WesternEurope by agreeing to the INF deal, first proposed by Reagan in1981. It cast him as a dramatically different, more peacefulKremlin leader.   Now NATO wants to test Gorbachev's intentions further byproposing that he eliminate the Warsaw Pact's capability to launcha surprise attack by conventional forces.   The two military blocs have been working for one year to agreeon a framework for a new set of negotiations to establish a morestable balance of non-nuclear forces in Europe. The talks may beginthis fall.   These talks would replace a narrower set of East-Westnegotiations on cutting troop levels, which have gone nowhere in 15years.   The new negotiations would be even more complicated,encompassing a wider geographic area, involving more nations andincluding not only troops but also a wide range of weapons andequipment.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert Burns has covered the North AtlanticTreaty Organization from his base in Brussels since 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
