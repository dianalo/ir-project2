Supreme Court: False Obituary Not Necessarily Libel</HEAD><DATELINE>TRENTON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The New Jersey Supreme Court ruled Tuesdaythat publication of a living woman's obituary did not necessarilyharm her reputation and thus does not constitute libel.   The high court affirmed two lower court rulings against a familythat sued the Princeton Packet, which in 1985 published theobituary of a woman who had not died.   The publication is not defamatory because the reported death ofan individual does not impugn someone's reputation, the court saidin an unanimous opinion.   ``Death is a natural state and demeans no one,'' the court said.   One year after publication of the false obituary of MarcyDecker, the woman, her son and her mother sued for defamation andemotional distress.   The onetime Princeton resident said the emotional effectscontributed to the loss of her job and aided her ex-husband's legalbattle to gain custody of the couple's child.   Ms. Decker and her mother also claimed embarrassment and anxietydue to the publication of the obituary in the bi-weekly paper.   The court said the woman would not have legal redress unless thenewspaper falsely reported demeaning circumstances surrounding thedeath. Moreover, the court noted, the Packet acted properly bypromptly publishing a retraction.   ``The publication of the death notice did not impute to theplaintiff any wrong and did not hold her up to ridicule,'' thecourt said.   The seventh member of the court, Chief Justice Robert Wilentz,did not participate in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
