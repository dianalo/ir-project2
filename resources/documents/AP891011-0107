Sun on the coup attempt in Panama:   The failure of the (coup attempt in Panama is) a blow to everyfreedom-loving person in the world as Panamanians continue to livein fear.   It didn't have to work the way it did. The United Statesgovernment was there and ready to aid the rebels. It knew about theplanned coup two days in advance. ... So for the Pentagon andsecurity agencies to watch ... invites investigation. ...   Those who would have the United States troops swoop into PanamaCity ... would do well to remember the rise of the successfulpopular movement to remove Ferdinand Marcos from power in thePhilippines in 1985 and 1986.   Such a movement has yet to take place in Panama. ...   If a popular movement to oust (Gen. Manuel Antonio) Noreigafails and brings violence on the heads of the Panamanians, then thelives of American military personnel should be risked, but notbefore.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 7   The State, Columbia, S.C., on Gorbachev's ban of labor strikes:   Alarmed that a series of labor walkouts _ some for economic,some for ethnic and some for political reasons _ were damaging theeconomy and undercutting perestroika, (Mikhail) Gorbachev asked theSoviet legislature to ban strikes altogether for 15 months.   The Supreme Soviet broke out in debate. One deputy even had thegall to call a ban unconstitutional. In the old days, when theleader spoke, real debate did not follow _ not if those who woulddissent cherished their place in the scheme of things.   This time the deputies got together and proposed a compromisethat was less than ... Gorbachev wanted but which he could accept.   Under the compromise, strikes will be forbidden selectively incertain key economic areas, and government agencies were givenpermission to take over the railroads in the restive republics ofAzerbaijan and Armenia to keep traffic moving.   While this hardly constituted a crushing legislative defeat forComrade No. 1, it suggested that the concept of separation ofpowers is no longer a totally foreign one in the Soviet Union.Furthermore, in the pre-Gorbachev days, Soviet leaders didn'tbother to seek legislative approval to stop strikes. The normalprocedure was to repress them ruthlessly.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 8   Corpus Christi (Texas) Caller-Times on Jim Bakker's conviction:   The conviction of televangelist Jim Bakker on 24 counts of fraudand conspiracy was certainly a blow to him personally, and to thosewho retain faith in the defrocked minister. And the conviction,plus the revelations which went into it, have delivered a blow totelevision high-voltage ministries in general. ...   But none of this should reflect upon religion itself. That wouldbe the most tragic outcome of all. What Bakker was convicted of hadto do not with religion, but with the perversion of religion forpersonal gain.   If anything, the affair could be a positive factor fortraditional churches. It issues a warning to the unwary againstbeing taken in by a charismatic video preacher, encouraging thesupport of local churches instead. If any good comes of the Bakkertrial, that could be it.</TEXT><TEXT>   Oct. 5   Centre Daily Times, State College, Pa., on airline deregulation:   Democratic lawmakers have long been concerned about decliningairline competition, ... but their concerns were largely ignored bythe Reagan administration.   There are encouraging signs, however, that President Bush and agrowing number of Republican lawmakers are finally noticing theevidence, particularly of monopoly control at major hub airports,and may support steps to increase competition.   Airline deregulation was expected to encourage new airlines andmore competition by getting rid of government red tape. Since thechanges took effect in 1978, many new airlines were launched butmost went out of businesss. At the same time, the Reaganadministration failed to increase airport capacity and, moreimportant, approved a string of large airline mergers. The resultshave been higher fares and fewer options for consumers.   Department figures underscore the need for changes to break up... near monopolies. In 1988, eight airlines accounted for 90percent of domestic air traffic, compared with 15 carriers in 1984and 11 in 1979.   Republicans ... are weighing legislation that could forceairlines to sell their computerized reservation systems, cap thepercentage of gates an airline may control at an airport, and banor restrict carriers' long-term leases at airports.   In the long run, of course, increasing airport gates andexpanding facilities (are) the best way to stimulate competition.But since that's not likely to happen immediately or on a largeenough scale, the growing interest in Congress and theadministration in taking other steps is welcome.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
