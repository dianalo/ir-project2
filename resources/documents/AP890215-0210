Airing Sunday on CBS, ``The Fulfillment of Mary Gray'' is basedon the romantic novel ``The Fulfillment,'' by LaVeryle Spencer,about a turn-of-the-century farm couple who consider an unusual wayof overcoming their lack of children.   ``The husband decides that his younger brother can father theirchild,'' Miss Ladd said.   The author based the book on stories she had heard from hergrandmother. The book was recommended to Miss Ladd by her mother.   ``My mother's an avid reader,'' Miss Ladd said. ``She not onlyrecommended that I read it but said it would make a fabulous film. Iread it and agreed with her. It has great characters and a rich andpowerful story. Good stories are tough to find. I worked on thescript six to eight months with Laird Koenig.''   Miss Ladd's husband, Brian Russell, was supervising producer onthe film. Miss Ladd said she liked the story because of the way thecharacters' relationships changed.   ``The wife and the brother had been friendly up to that time, butthere was nothing more,'' said Miss Ladd. ``But when the husbandmakes the announcement at the dinner table, it changes allrelationships. They had been married for seven years and had nochildren. He comes to the conclusion it was because he had mumps asa boy. He's a very religious man and he prays and prays and comes tothis decision.   ``She's very hurt by the suggestion that he would give her toanother man. He thinks he's giving her a gift. Children are veryimportant on farms, and it's important that the land be passed ongeneration to generation. When the husband goes out of town for afew days they make a baby and fall in love. Now it really getssticky because she loves both of them.''   The movie also stars Ted Levine as her husband and Lewis Smith asthe younger brother. Piers Haggard directed. The movie was filmed inBrenham, Texas, which stood in for Minnesota.   ``We got the weather we needed, in fact, all four seasons,'' shesaid. ``We found a farm house from the early 1900s and a grange hallfor a dance.''   Miss Ladd said she was attracted to the book because it's astrong story that presents ``a moral issue that we can all relateto.''   ``These are all imperfect people,'' she said. ``You can feel thepain they're going through. They're good people trying to do theright thing. The husband is solid, quiet and introspective. Thebrother is more open and more fun. Put them together and they make acomplete man.''   Miss Ladd's last television appearance was the CBS miniseries``Bluegrass,'' but she is best known for the popular series of the1970s, ``Charlie's Angels.''   Her latest feature film, ``Millenium,'' which also stars DanielJ. Travanti and Kris Kristofferson, will be out in April.   ``I play a woman a thousand years in the future in what's reallya time-travel love story,'' she said. ``I come to the present andfall in love. It's written by John Varley, who's a leading sciencefiction writer. He spent a lot of time on the set. He has a veryfree and strange imagination.''   Miss Ladd said she is still asked frequently to do another series.   ``I'm not ready yet for another series,'' she said. ``I'm havingtoo much fun playing all these different characters.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Elsewhere in television:   CASTING NEWS _ Robert Gossett plays the husband of Lynn Whitfieldon ABC's ``HeartBeat.''
