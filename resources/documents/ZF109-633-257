 Perhapsyou've settled for uninspiring black-and-white reports and newslettersbecause you lack the know-how and resources for color print jobs.andP;  Maybeyou've thrown up your hands and hired an outside designer, sacrificing thestep-by-step control you've come to love when creating your black-and-whitepublications.andM;You needn't be grounded by color print jobs.andP;  In fact, better desk-toppublishing programs are making it more practical and economical than ever touse your PC and an inhouse color printer to cut costs and maintain controlover any print job, including those that are destined for a traditionalprinting press.andM;Reduce Prepress CostsandM;The most common traditional printing method is offset lithography.andP;  It's thecheapest, fastest way to produce brochures, newsletters and other documentsin large quantities.andP;  Color press time itself adds only 10 percent per colorto offset printing costs.andP;  It's prepress work--all the tasks that need to bedone before the presses roll--that really makes outside color printingexpensive.andP;  You can use your PC to lower or eliminate many of those costs.andM;If a page is to be printed in only one color (black is a color as far asprinters are concerned) and the page contains only text and line art, thetraditional prepress steps are simple.andP;  The printer photographs the page anddevelops the negative, which is used to etch an image onto a metal platecoated with a light-sensitive material.andP;  The plate, in turn, goes on thepresses and transfers ink to paper.andM;Pages with photographs and those printed in multiple colors are morecomplicated.andP;  The print shop makes a full-page negative for every color beingused and &quot;strips&quot; each one by hand, taping over blank areas and masking outelements that should not be printed in a certain color.andM;Because these traditional methods demand time and skill, they are costly.andO;You need long print runs to make the pre-piece cost economical.andP;  Or you canassign the work to one of the new desktop color applications.andP;  With theirbuilt-in ability to perform many prepress steps, you can afford to printfewer than 1,000 copies of a color newsletter or brochure.andP;  And theseprograms make it easier and cheaper for you to play with differnet designconcepts before committing yourself to a large color print job.andM;You can create a color document on your PC's screen and print it on your ownprinter, but you don't deliver a full-color printout of a page to yourcommercial printer.andP;  Instead, you must create separations, black-and-whiteimages of each page for each color of ink.andM;Both spot color and process color--the two methods of color printing--requireseparations because each color is printed with a different plate.andP;  Each spotcolor is printed with a single, solid color of ink that is mixed to prodcucethe desires shade before the ink is put on the press.andP;  Process color, on theother hand, uses four inks--the three subtractive primaries (yellow, cyan andmagenta) plus black--printed one on top of the other in a pattern of halftonedots.andM;Use spot color if your document has no more than two or three colorsaltogether.andP;  Also, check with your printing company: Many offset printershave only two- or three-color presses; pocess color requires a four-colorpress.andP;  Process color is necessary for printing continuous-tone color images(such as color photographs and illustrations).andP;  Because process colors are&quot;mixed&quot; on the press rather than before printing, they allow a much widerrange of colors and shades than spot color does.andM;Separating color elements absorbs a large share of traditional prepressbudgets, but the task can be handled less expensively with your PC.andP;  Desktoppublishing programs such as PageMaker and Ventura Publisher offer spot colorseparation as a sprint option, while some color graphics software backages(Micrografx Designer 3.0 and Corel Draw, for instance) create separations forboth spot and process color.andM;If the graphics or desktop publishing program you use doesn't print colorseparations, add-in color separation/correction software is available.andO;Publisher's Prism, $695 from InSight Systems in Vienna, Virginia(800688-0250), is one such product.andP;  A postScript color separator, Prismgenerates a set of four film negatives that are used to prepare theprocess-color plates.andP;  Both DOS and Windows versions are available.andM;Highlight with Spot ColorandM;Desktop publishing programs with color capability do amazing work,considering how much effort and painstaking care go into the tradionalprepress steps.andP;  For spot color, the printer shotts the mechanical once foreach color and, each time, masks out or opaques areas that don't use thatcolor.andP;  If elements in different colors touch--for example, purple type inthe middle of a red circle--special care must be taken to ensure that thoseelements meet precisely.andP;  Hightly trained craftspeople work as meticulouslyas surgeons to cut the traps and butts--edges around artwork where to colorswill meet on a page.andP;  If the trim is off by as much as a knife's edge or ifthe final plates are out of alignment by a hairline, you'll see a flaw in theprinted piece.andM;PC programs the support spot color separations (including Micrografx Designer3.0, Corel Draw and PageMaker) make the separations part of the printcommand.andP;  When you print a page for spot color, the application prints onepage for each color used.andP;  One page contains all the elements that will printin black, another contains all the elements that will print in, for example,red and so on.andM;The printouts are actually in black, no matter what color they represent.andO;Images don't become color until color inks are pressed onto the paper.andP;  Theapplication handles the fine edges between colors; the registration marks itprints on each page are used later to align the negatives.andM;Color-Matching SystemsandM;In addition to separating elements for spot color, you need to tell the printshop eactly which ink colors you want them to use.andP;  Commercially printedcolors rarely appear exactly as yoiu preview them onscreen or on a colorprintout, how-ever.andP;  The most precise way to specify color to the print shopis to use a color-matching system.andM;The most common of these systems is the Pantone Matching System (PMS).andP;  PMSink swatchbooks can be purchased at any graphic arts supply store.andP;  Use aswatchbook to select the PMS colors that match the shades you want in yourpublication and to identify them to the printer.andP;  Printers either usepublished formulas to mix PMS colors or mix the inks they have to match anyswatch you provide.andM;Process Color for VarietyandM;Four-color printing permits a wider range of colors than is possible oreconomical with spot color.andP;  Process colors can look very much like spotcolors, but they're not actually printed as a solid color.andP;  Instead, they'recombinations of dots (or halftone screens) printed in four colors.andP;  Each ofthe four screens is shot at a slightly different angle to create the illusionof a smooth, continuous tone.andP;  (If the screens are not angled property, thedots may print on top of one another or create moire patterns of wavy orplaid lines where dots overlap.)andM;Using process color is less expensive than using spot color when you wantmore than four colors on a page.andP;  For example, you can create what appears tobe a solid block of standard blue by printing screens of cyan and magenta inequal proportions--a 50 percent screen of cyan and a 50 percent screen ofmagenta.andP;  Varying the density of these screens produces other colors.andP;  Reducethe proportion of cyan ink to 30 percent and increase magenta to 70 percent,and you have purple.andP;  Reduce the proportion of magenta to concoct variousteals and turquoises.andP;  Using this process means that instead of paying for 10plates for 10 different spot colors, you can create all 10 colors with onlythe four process-color plates.andM;Traditionally, you'd tell your printer what PMS shades you want to match andthe printer would create the angled screens needed for those colors.andP;  Nowsome desktop applications let you specify colors as percentages of primarycolors, and either the graphics application or a special separatingapplication prints the separated screens.andP;  For example, Corel Draw andMicrografx Designer print process color separations to any PostScript device.andO;PageMaker and Ventura don't support process color, but you can makeprocess-color separations for documents created with these applications withInSight Systems' Publisher's Prism.andM;Photographic Color ServicesandM;Four-color process printing is the only method currently used to printcontinuous-tone color images, such as color photographs.andP;  High-end graphicsprograms have the basic capabilities for separating digitized art (hardcopyart captured electronically) as well as art created on computers.andP;  Otherprograms perform color correction and retouching on computerized colorimages.andP;  These methods won't produce continuous-tone separations that rivalthose produced by printers and engravers, but they are reasonablealternatives for publications on tight budgets and with fairly low qualityrequirements--an internal company newsletter, for example.andP;  Forprofessional-quality reproduction of color photographs published in, say, asales brochure, use an outside color service in order to get a completelyprofessional look.andM;Specialty firms offer access to a wide range of high-quality input and outputdevices, software and techniques for color images.andP;  Although low-end colorscanners are great for preparing images to view onscreen or in slides,they're generally not good enough for full-color photographs.andP;  A servicebureau can provide a high-end scanner and can perform demanding retouchingand color-correction tasks.andP;  The bureau can also work with you to createunusual special effects that you may not have realized were possible.andM;On service bureau, Scitex (617-275-5150), in Bedford, Massachusetts, nowoffers conversion of PostScript files, and aldus promises (through its OpenPress Interface, now available only on the Macintosh) to offer links betweenPageMaker and high-end prepress systems.andP;  This means you can produce afull-page layout with a low-resolution color scanner on your own PC in orderto show a prepress service bureau how to position and crop an image.andM;Using your disk files, a prepress service will transfer your layout into thehigh-end system for final color processing and use a high-end output deviceto tailor full-page color separations to your specifications.andP;  Some serviceswill rescan your original color photograph with a high-end scanner; othershave developed proprietary techniques for enhancing low-resolution imagesduring the transfer to the color prepress system.andP;  (For instance, it'sstandard practice among service bureaus to save color PostScript files in.EPS format and then transfer them to a Macintosh to be separated by Adobeseparator:) In any case, you save prepress costs by going as far as you canon your own.andM;It's equally valuable that prepress service bureaus can serve as liaisonsbetween printers and color trade shops.andP;  While they may be equipped to dodesktop color page makeup for some jobs, most bureaus also work closely withtraditional printers and can offer advice about the most effective ways ofmixing the capabilities of desktop systems and other equipment.andP;  With thehelp of prepress service bureaus, you can stay within your budget and get thecolor results you want.andM;QUALITYandM;If an image begins as a color photograph, the scanning process has the firstand most dramatic effect on quality.andP;  Good color scanners cost as much as$30,000.andP;  Unless you use color photographs enough to justify that kind ofexpense, it's better to have an outside service bureau do the scanning.andM;Next, quality is affected by the sophistication of your graphics or imageprocessing software.andP;  For example, undercolor removal--removing colors tomake dark areas less muddy--is an important quality-control feature.andP;  It'sstandard on expensive color prepress systems but is not available with mostdesk-top programs.andP;  If you're serious about color publishing, don't settlefor low-end software, and be aware tht even with high-end color prepresssystems, color production is always a compromise.andP;  What you see on any screendisplay is almost never what you get on paper.andM;Color separations also affect quality.andP;  A good color-separation programtranslates the standard additive primary colors (red, green and blue) to thesubtractive primaries used in printing (cyan, magenta and yellow).andP;  Theconversion formulas are complex, and more sophisticated separation softwarecosts more.andM;Desktop technology makes color printing cheaper and faster, but notbetter--yet.andP;  Many publishers who use desktop systems to develop their ideasin color still farm out all color separation to the offset print shop.andM;STORAGEandM;Color documents require more disk storage space than black-and-whitedocuments.andP;  A color scan saved at moderate resolution requires as much as 8MBof disk space; images saved a high resolution require much more.andP;  These largefiles mean that to work in color you need more memory and more diskspace--and more time (see below).andP;  New color compression techniques andhigh-density storage media such as CD-ROM can help.andM;SPEEDandM;Scanning and printing color images takes longer than for black-and-whiteimages.andP;  It may take 30 minutes to scan a full-color page using a high-endscanner that captures all the information needed for process-colorseparations.andP;  This is fine if you're producing a monthly newsletter with onlya few color images, but not for a daily paper.andP;  And it takes longer toimport, display, copy and transmit documents with color.andM;STANDARDSandM;The lack of standards among graphics and desktop publishing programs meansyou may need another program in addition to your desktop publishing softwareto separate color.andP;  For example, PageMaker prints spot color separations forelements colored in PageMaker itself, but it doesn't separate imported colorimages.andP;  In a perfect world, a few standard color formats would be supportedby all desktop publishing and graphics applications.andM;COSTandM;When calculating how much you're willing to invest in bringing color printingcapabilities in-house, include the cost of added memory, storage capacity, acolor monitor, a color scanner, a color printer or slide recorder, the addedcost of color offset printing for large jobs and the cost of operatortraining.andP;  Color manipulation is a complex craft.andP;  A software application maybe easy to learn and use, but it won't give you the results you want withoutextensive experience and experimentation.andP;  Expect to pay more for atechnician who is skilled in color manipulation or to pay an outside servicebureau for the final color adjustments and separations.andM;COLOR PRINTERS FOR IN-HOUSE JOBSandM;For anyone familiar with black-and-white desktop publishing, color is alogical step.andP;  You design and edit your page as you would a black-and-whitedocument, incorporating line-art illustrations or scanned images if you wish.andO;Then you assign colors and shades to elements you want to print in color,such as borders and headlines.andM;Most publishing software works with a variety of color printers, from low-enddot matrix models to expensive thermal transfer machines.andP;  One of the mostdifficult tasks in desktop publishing is choosing a printer that matches bothyour budget and the type of work you want to do.andP;  All of them make snappywork of short-run office publications, overhead transparencies and colorhandouts.andP;  Here are some of your options when choosing a color printer.andM;At the low end you'll find dot matrix color printers--the 24-pin $949 EpsonLQ-860 is a good example.andP;  Dot matrix color printers use color ribbons andmechanical printheads like those found in low-end black-and-white printers.andO;There are trade-offs for the low price tags, however--you get low resolution,slow printing speed (the Epson moves along at just 82 characters per second),a limited color palette, poor color quality and banding (streaks across theprinted image that result from the moving carriage).andP;  Nevertheless, a dotmatrix color printer is a worthwhile investment for in-house presentationsand for printing rough proofs of color images you plan to have printed by anoutside company.andM;Further up the scale are color ink jet printers, which spray color inks ontoa page--these include the $2,495 Hewlett-Packard PaintJet XL.andP;  Ink jetprinters offer higher resolution, faster printing and better-quality colorthan dot matrix printers.andM;At the high end, you'll find a variety of exotic technologies, includingthermal printers that use heat to seal color pigments in a wax or plasticcoating onto mylar, laser printers that use color toner cartridges andthermal dye printers that approach photographic quality.andP;  Thermal printersstart at about $10,000; a popular model among desktop publishers is the QMSColorScript 100 model 10, which lists for $9,995.andP;  The big investment makessense only if you do frequent, high-volume color printing.andM;Before buying a color printer, make sure the software you use comes with adriver for it.andP;  Dot matrix and ink jet printers are not PostScript printers,for example, whereasandM;most thermal and laser color printers do support PostScript.andP;   IfandM;your application runs under Windows, it can print to any printer for whichyou have installed the Windows driver.andM;Besides compatibility and the cost of the printer itself, factor into yourbuying decision the cost of supplies.andP;  Most ink jet and thermal colorprinters require special coated paper or special transparent film foroverhead transparencies.andP;  You'll need to stock color ribbons, ink cartridgesor toner cartridges.andP;  You'll be surprised how quickly these supplies vanishwhen you're printing full-page color images with solid-color backgrounds.andM;If you don't do enough color printing to justify a high-end printer, alow-price printer is still good for small jobs--less than a dozen copies--andfor transparencies.andP;  If you need more than a dozen or so copies, the slowprinting speed and cost of color cartridges or inks make it more economicalto print only one color master and reproduce that master on a color copier.andM;For large jobs--several dozen copies or more--a low-end printer helps cutcosts by preparing your documents in-house and printing low-quality colorproofs for review by writers and designers.andP;  When everyone's happy with thedesign, you can save the document to a file and give it to an outsideprinter, who can choose the printing method that best suits your needs andbudget.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
