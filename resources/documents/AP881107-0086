It's a `Pay up ordie, we're not messing around!' type of thing. They threaten theirchildren or other members of their family,'' said Los Angeles CountySheriff's Sgt. Bob Welch.   The letters, sent to doctors, dentists, lawyers and affluentbusiness people, demanded payments ranging from $500 to more than$500,000, Welch said.   The letters were so personal that the author is believed to haveintimate knowledge of the victims and their families.   ``A lot of people have anxiety because of the personalized natureof the letters,'' said Welch, who is part of a small task forceinvestigating the case.   ``There was stuff in some of the letters that could almost beclassified as gossip,'' said Larry Grooms, city editor of theAntelope Valley Press, which is offering a $10,000 reward. ``Somegoes back four or five years. In one instance, there was nickname aguy had in high school.''   Computers were being used in an effort to find a common thread ofclues that might link the victims to a suspect, Welch said. Inaddition, he said, deputies were interviewing letter recipients tosee if their families, jobs or other outside activities might makethem targets of extortion.   The letters were mailed Nov. 1 with a Mojave postmark and sent topeople in Lancaster, Palmdale and the unincorporated area of QuartzHill, Welch said.</TEXT></DOC>
