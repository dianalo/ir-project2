Its Spectra instant camera is selling briskly. The weak dollar has boosted overseas results. And earnings, after more than doubling in 1986, should see another healthy rise this year.    But Polaroid's stock price has languished, and although it now looks like a bargain to many analysts, others are skeptical. The doubters question the long-term outlook for instant cameras, in the face of competition from the 35mm and new disposable models.    Polaroid's share price currently stands about where it was a year ago, after an early 1986 surge that anticipated Spectra's April debut. The shares, after rallying briefly to a peak of 83 three weeks ago, have fallen back to the mid-70s and closed yesterday at 71 7/8, down 7/8.    Some call the shares a bargain at the current price. &quot;The long-term trend is strongly up,&quot; contends James Magid, president of a New York investment company and a former photography analyst. Brenda Lee Landry, a principal at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. says, &quot;The stock looks very attractive.&quot; Its price could reach 100 in the long run, she says, and might rise to the 80s in the next few months.    But the skeptics argue that despite Spectra's success to date, it's unclear whether the camera has reversed -- or only temporarily halted -- the overall decline of instant cameras and their film, which account for about 55% of Polaroid's business.    &quot;There has been deteriorating consumer demand for instant photography since 1978, and I tend to think that (falling) demand will continue,&quot; says Michael Ellmann, a Wertheim andamp; Co. analyst. He thinks the stock is overpriced about $5 a share.    The conflicting views have been reflected in the recent ups and downs of Polaroid stock. The shares posted a healthy increase from mid-January to mid-February after Ms. Landry, long a bull on the stock, reaffirmed her buy recommendation. But they slid after the company released fourth-quarter earnings and began indicating to analysts that sales of Spectra were lower than expected in the quarter. The camera takes sharper pictures with brighter colors than previous instant models.    The bulls figure that Polaroid, with Spectra's help, may sell an estimated five million instant cameras world-wide this year, up from 4.3 million last year. In 1985, before Spectra, Polaroid sold just 3.5 million cameras, down from a peak of 9.4 million in 1978. The Spectra's retail price runs about $130 to $150.    Regina Wiedenski, an Adams, Harkness andamp; Hill Inc. analyst, says fourth-quarter Spectra sales were hurt only by tight inventory policies among retailers who feared sluggishness in overall sales at Christmas. &quot;Retailers clearly didn't want to be overstocked at the end of the year, so they underordered,&quot; she says.    Some big retailers have kind words for Spectra. Abe Brown, general manager of 47th Street Photo Inc., the New York-based discount camera and electronics business, says Spectra sales haven't slackened since he started selling the camera, and instant-camera sales are way above those of a year ago. &quot;Spectra has absolutely revitalized the instant photography market,&quot; he says.    Charles Ryan, a vice president at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, adds: &quot;Film sales should be up substantially this year&quot; because more people will have owned Spectra for a full year, and film sales usually lag behind camera sales. Others also expect the company's industrial side to grow faster, as Polaroid's more innovative spirit spills over into its other businesses such as industrial photography.    Bears note that Polaroid's sales growth reflects the forced exit of Eastman Kodak Co. from the U.S. instant-camera market early last year. Polaroid, which now has the market to itself, ousted Kodak with a victory in patent litigation. Damages have yet to be determined, but the rival's departure naturally has bolstered Polaroid's sales.    David Katz, president of Underground Camera Inc., a Foxboro, Mass.-based retail chain, says Spectra sales at his stores were strong for a while but &quot;softened&quot; through Christmas. &quot;The bang of the introduction and heavy advertising had ended,&quot; he says.    Peter Enderlin of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. recently changed his &quot;buy&quot; stance on Polaroid to &quot;neutral.&quot; In a report, he says that Polaroid's lower-than-expected camera sales in 1986 will restrain growth in film sales this year. &quot;Although the stock could have further to go in a strong market,&quot; he explains, &quot;we now believe that near-term risks approximately equal rewards.&quot;    ---   Polaroid   (NYSE; Symbol: PRD)   Business: Instant photography   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Revenue: $1.63 billion   Earnings: $103.5 million, or $3.34 a share    Fourth quarter Dec. 31, 1986:   Per-share earnings: $1.27 vs. 84 cents    Average daily trading volume:   316,747 shares (February)   Common shares outstanding: 31 million </TEXT></DOC>
