The plaintiff, Jeffery Collins, had filed suit againstShell after being dismissed in 1985. Dr. Collins, who wasdirector of therapeutic products at Triton Biosciences Inc.,a former unit of Shell based in Alameda, Calif., had been aShell employee since 1967. He was fired a month after Shellmanagement obtained a copy of some &quot;house rules&quot; for a gayparty that he had prepared on his work computer.</LP><TEXT>   Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Taber found that Shell hadviolated assurances that they would not fire any employeeexcept for unsatisfactory job performance. The judge heldthat Dr. Collins, the son of a former Shell refinery manager,had an exemplary employment history with &quot;consistently high&quot;performance reviews.   &quot;The court finds plaintiff was fired solely because he wasa sexually active homosexual, which defendants learned forthe first time from the memo accidentally left at the printerin the copy room,&quot; Judge Taber found. &quot;The evidence isoverwhelming that homosexual group sexual activity was beyondthe pale of conduct acceptable to the top management ofShell,&quot; the judge added.   The award includes $2 million in emotional distress andpunitive damages.   A spokesman for Houston-based Shell, the U.S. unit ofRoyal Dutch/Shell Group, the Anglo-Dutch oil company,expressed disappointment at the ruling and said &quot;sexualorientation is not a consideration in our hiring or otheremployment practices.&quot; He said the company is consideringwhether to appeal. Triton Biosciences, a biotechnologycompany, was sold to Schering AG of Berlin last year.   The judge criticized Shell for waiting until Dr. Collinshad made a key presentation to Triton's board before firinghim, and for creating &quot;out of whole cloth a reason fordismissal based upon a `true' reevaluation of plaintiff'swork performance.&quot; The judge also chided Shell for disclosingthe contents of his party announcement to headhunters,thereby complicating Dr. Collins's search for new work. Theformer employee, who holds a doctorate in veterinarymedicine, is currently a shipping manager for a pet company,according to his lawyer.   The judge also held that the invitation, while &quot;offensiveto most people, men and women alike, and certainly . . . notto be circulated around in the workplace,&quot; amounted to &quot;apolitical activity&quot; under the state's fair employment lawbecause it advocated safe sexual practices and was thusentitled to special protection.   Paul Wotman, a San Francisco lawyer for Dr. Collins, saidthe decision was the largest gay wrongful-termination verdictever, and would &quot;prevent or cause employers in California tocarefully evaluate whether they should terminate anyone'semployment for something that is not related to their own jobperformance.&quot;   There aren't any state or federal laws that explicitly banemployers from firing people because of their sexualorientation, although state and federal legislation to thatend is currently pending. Some localities do ban suchdiscrimination, and job bias against AIDS patients is clearlybarred.   &quot;Sexual orientation is not protected, but there are somany other protections that come into play,&quot; said VictorSchachter, a San Francisco lawyer specializing in managementlabor issues. &quot;The other side of this is, to the extent towhich somebody tried to press views on other employees,interfering with their work, that is not the kind ofactivity&quot; that a company or a court would likely condone.   ---   ALL-MALE STATUS of Virginia Military Institute upheld byfederal judge.   The state-supported college may continue to bar womenbecause its single-sex status has allowed it to develop aunique educational method, U.S. District Judge Jackson L.Kiser ruled Friday in Roanoke, Va. VMI's distinctive programadds diversity to public educational institutions and thusmeets an important government objective, Judge Kiser said.   Admitting women would inevitably alter VMI's system,stripping the 152-year-old Lexington, Va., institution of itsdistinguishing features, he ruled.   &quot;If the Supreme Court upholds this decision, it wouldsignal a real return to legal sexism, because that's whatthis is,&quot; said Isabelle Katz Pinzler, director of the women'srights project at the American Civil Liberties Union. &quot;It'sunconstitutional. It's preserving a male domain. It's justpure sexism.&quot;   In deciding for VMI, Judge Kiser dismissed the U.S.Justice Department's contention that a single-sex admissionspolicy at a public college violated the equal protectionclause of the 14th Amendment and Title IX of the Civil RightsAct. The Justice Department had filed the suit on behalf of afemale high school student who wished to attend VMI. JusticeDepartment officials wouldn't comment on the ruling or saywhether they plan to appeal.   Judge Kiser based his ruling on a 1982 Supreme Courtdecision permitting discriminatory admissions policies onlyif they helped the institution serve important governmentgoals. &quot;Elements of the . . . VMI educational system, withits focus on barracks life, would be fundamentally altered,and the distinctive ends of the system would be thwarted, ifVMI were forced to admit females and to make changesnecessary to accommodate their needs and interests,&quot; JudgeKiser wrote in his 21-page opinion.   Unlike other military academies, VMI trains students forcivilian life, using bootcamp tactics to turn cadets into&quot;citizensoldiers.&quot; Admitting women would destroy the school'segalitarian atmosphere by forcing VMI to dilute its rigorousphysical requirements and moderate its no-privacy policy,said Frank B. Atkinson, an attorney for VMI with McGuire,Woods, Battle andamp; Boothe in Richmond, Va.   ---   RANDOM DRUG TESTS for rail workers upheld by federalappeals court.   The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Franciscoruled that random drug testing of rail workers insafety-sensitive positions doesn't violate the FourthAmendment's prohibition against unreasonable searches.   The ruling follows similar Ninth Circuit decisions againstemployee groups from various other transportation industries.In April, the appellate court approved sweeping federalregulations authorizing truck and bus companies to conductrandom employee drug tests.   In a landmark 1989 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court upheldpost-accident drug screening of railway workers. In thelatest case before the appeals court, the Railway LaborExecutives' Association, a labor union, argued unsuccessfullythat the Supreme Court's decision should be limited to testsafter an accident, or those following a rule violation orother &quot;triggering event.&quot;   Lawrence Mann, a Washington lawyer for the Railway LaborExecutives, said that the union wasn't planning to appeal theNinth Circuit's decision. &quot;There's no sense beating a deadhorse,&quot; Mr. Mann said.   ---   NOTED: Public officials would be prohibited from revealingthe identities of alleged rape victims under a proposed lawpassed by both houses of the New York Legislature. Violationof the law would subject the public official who revealed thename to civil damages. However, news organizations wouldn'tbe penalized for revealing the alleged victim's name. Gov.Mario Cuomo's office said the governor would study thelegislation before deciding whether to sign it.   ---   Corrections andamp; Amplifications                                                                                                          AT LEAST FOUR STATES have laws explicitly banningemployment discrimination based on sexual orientation.Yesterday's edition incorrectly indicated there weren't anysuch state laws.
