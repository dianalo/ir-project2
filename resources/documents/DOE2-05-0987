The system provides an automatedconfiguration management framework within which all software developmentand maintenance activities are performed. The LANSCE environment providesa comprehensive configuration management (CM) system based upon a commerciallyavailable CM tool. The CM component ensures the integrity of all LANSCEapplication software, automatically performs status accounting operations,and provides a flexible automated facility for rebuilding resident softwarecomponents and restoring them to the baseline. It employs high-leveldata structures both to enhance significantly the level of automationthat can be achieved and to provide extensive, integrated support tothe software development community. We discuss the software managementphilosophy that led to the development of the LANSCE environment on programmerproductivity, system integration and software management effectiveness.8 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
