The Congress of South African Trade Unions completed a four-dayconference with a call to ``intensify our campaign of resistance''aimed at dismantling apartheid and capitalism.   The congress said that unless the government repeals thecontroversial Labor Relations Act by Sept. 1, member unions willtake ``sustained action'' against parliamentary elections set forSept. 6.   Jay Naidoo, general secretary of the 921,000-member congress, didnot say what tactics the group would use. Similar calls in the pasthave resulted in mass strikes.   Whites, Asians and people of mixed race will vote for the threeseparate houses of Parliament in segregated elections. Underapartheid, the country's 28 illion blacks have no voice in nationalaffairs.   Naidoo said a ``workers' summit'' would be convened in August todevelop campaigns against the elections and the Labor Relations Act.   The year-old legislation has strengthened management's ability toend strikes through court action and allows companies to sue unionsfor losses incurred during a strike.   Naidoo also said the congress, banned from political activity,wants to play a leading role in creating a huge anti-apartheidcoalition.   The congress will seek to arrange a conference no later thanOctober, Naidoo said. The conference was suggested by the NationalUnion of Mineworkers, which has about 300,000 members and is thelargest affiliate of the congress.   Anti-apartheid groups have been attempting to form unifiedstrategies since the July 5 meeting between President P.W. Botha andjailed black nationalist Nelson Mandela, leader of the AfricanNational Congress.   Some organizations have called the meeting a positivedevelopment, while others maintain it is merely governmentpropaganda.   ``There has to be a clear signal from the apartheid regime thatit is interested in genuine negotiations,'' Naidoo told a newsconference. ``This has not happened.''   Local newspapers have said that Naidoo and the president of thecongress, Elijah Barayi, are among several dozen people that Mandelahas requested to see at Victor Verster Prison on Tuesday, his 71stbirthday.   Naidoo and Barayi said they would welcome the opportunity to meetMandela but have not received permission from prison officials.   The congress supports the ANC, the main guerrilla groupattempting to undermine the white-led government. However, theorganizations disagree on some issues. For example, the ANC says itwill accept a mixed economy in South Africa while the laborfederation says it is committed to socialism.   The meeting, attended by almost 2,000 delegates, reaffirmed itssupport for comprehensive mandatory economic sanctions against SouthAfrica. It also called for foreign companies operating in SouthAfrica to divest and turn over their property and equipment to thelocal community.</TEXT></DOC>
