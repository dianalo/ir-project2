Antena 3 de Television is one of three private companies thatgained a license in August from the government of Socialist PrimeMinister Felipe Gonzalez.   During the first broadcast Thursday, beamed only to Madrid andBarcelona, announcer Miguel Angel Nieto wasted little time inshowing the new station will follow the strongly anti-governmentline of its national radio network.   ``We cannot ask your forgiveness for not appearing in all ofSpain,'' Nieto said. ``The government simply will not let us.''   Antena 3 and the other two private stations, all legallyrequired to begin regular programming by April 3, are broadcastthrough a state-owned telecommunications network, which officialssay is to cover the entire country by late 1991.   Parliament voted to create three private stations in 1988. UntilThursday, most Spaniards received three channels, two run by theSpanish government and a third run by their regional government.</TEXT></DOC>
