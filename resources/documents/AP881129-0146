Chia Chia, a 290-pound giant panda who likes to munch bamboo,attracted an estimated 400,000 people to a display featuring him atthe Cincinnati Zoo, where he arrived in early September from theLondon Zoo. He had lived in London since age 2, when he was capturedin China.   Officials had projected that 500,000 people would come to seeChia Chia, and blamed rainy weather and the fact that he wassecluded for several days at the beginning of the exhibit because hewas acting homesick and out of character.   Cincinnati Zoo officials said Chia Chia was being placed in alarge crate for shipment by van late Tuesday to Chicago, where he isto be put on a jet Wednesday for a trip to the Chapultepec Zoo inMexico City. That zoo has the best record for breeding pandasoutside China.   ``We're very sad to see him go,'' Cincinnati Zoo spokeswomanBarbara Brady said. ``He's very relaxed and comfortable and happyhere, and we're going to miss him.''   Giant pandas are an endangered species, and zoos worldwide areworking to try and save them by encouraging reproduction. About 800pandas are believed to exist worldwide.   Officials at the Mexican zoo plan to pair Chia Chia with6-year-old Tohui.   The Cincinnati Zoo agreed to apply all excess revenue from ChiaChia's visit toward the cost of new quarters built for him at theMexico City zoo. Any money left over then will go to a pandaconservation fund to be administered jointly by the Cincinnati andLondon zoos.   Chia Chia's visit produced about $200,000 in revenue, CincinnatiZoo officials said. Zoo officials said they have not worked out allof the money allocation and are uncertain whether money will be leftover for the conservation fund.</TEXT></DOC>
