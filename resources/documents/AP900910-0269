Announces 1,600 Layoffs</HEAD><BYLINE>By FRANCIS HOPKINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Foxboro Co., a multimillion-dollar companyrecently bought by a British firm, announced Monday it would layoff 1,600 employees worldwide as part of a restructuring.   ``While the path we have chosen is ambitious and initiallypainful, especially for the people directly impacted, the resultsof these actions will be improved prosperity and growth,'' said E.Barrie Stephens, chairman of Siebe PLC.   Siebe is a private manufacturer of electrical equipmentheadquartered in Windsor, England. It purchased Foxboro threemonths ago for $656.4 million, or $52 a share.   The firm now controls 98 percent of Foxboro stock, and has madearrangements to buy the final 2 percent of the Foxboro, Mass.-basedcompany.   The British company said it would be laying off 1,600 peopleover the next two quarters from Foxboro, which makes processcontrol instruments and systems.   John C. Fuller, a spokesman for Foxboro, said about 800 of thelayoffs will be from four plants in Massachusetts, and the restfrom its European facilities.   Fuller said Siebe was streamlining Foxboro and planned torestructure the company by increasing its global market andimproving its manufacturing abilities and technology.   ``I don't think any of it is directly related to how much(Siebe) paid or didn't pay. I think it is related to restoring theprofitability level,'' Fuller said.   He said Foxboro had not made money in three of the last fiveyears. ``This is looked more on as refocusing primarily onfinancial operations and sales and customer service and engineeringoperations,'' he said. ``In other words, focusing on the core ofthe business.''   Siebe completed the purchase of the company a week ago. OnFriday, Gary K. Willis, president and chief executive officer ofFoxboro, was fired and 300 employees at a plant in Foxboro werelaid off. Fuller said the layoffs were across the board, with fewdepartments remaining untouched.   Willis, whose firing was not announced until Monday, was notremoved as part of the streamlining and will be replaced soon,Fuller said.   ``I think the cutbacks over the past few years indicated thebuck stops somewhere and someone had to take responsibility forit,'' Fuller said of Willis.   He said the restructuring was expected to take six months tocomplete.   Stephens said in a written statement the new headquarters forFoxboro Europe will be based in Germany, and will be the center ofits sales and service organizations in the United Kingdom, France,Italy and the Netherlands.</TEXT></DOC>
