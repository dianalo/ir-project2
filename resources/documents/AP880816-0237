The Texas senator also said that despite Republicans' adorationof President Reagan, the the president's coattails will be veryshort when it comes to helping George Bush get elected.   Commenting later about George Bush's selection of Indiana Sen.Dan Quayle as his running mate on the GOP ticket, Bentsen said:``Of course we'll debate. I'm looking forward to it.''   ``I've looked across the aisle in the Senate at Dan Quayle, andI'll be looking forward to comparing our accomplishments in theSenate, and in turn what each of us could do for our running mate _assuming we were elected _ in pushing through and influencing thepassage of a legislative program for the new president,'' he said.   Asked if he was surprised by Quayle's selection, Bentsen said,``No, not particularly. I really wasn't concerned as to who itmight be.''   Bentsen, speaking in this oil town after a visit to the nearbyBig Hill Strategic Petroleum Reserve, said the nation's dependenceon foreign oil is now greater than it was in 1973 when the Arab oilembargo caused gas lines across the country.   ``The American people understand ... that for eight years thisadministration has steadfastly refused to produce an energy policythat will protect America's national interests,'' he told thegathering of about 500.   ``The Republicans tell you they have loosened OPEC's hold on theworld's petroleum markets, but the numbers tell you that todayAmerica is importing 42 percent of the oil we consume,'' he said.   ``Our dependence has increased by 15 percent while thisadministration has been lulled to sleep by low oil prices,'' hesaid.   The petroleum reserve program was launched in the wake of theoil shocks of the last decade. The six reserves are undergroundvaults of crude oil which can be retrieved in a national emergency.   Bentsen used the visit to the Big Hill site, the last of the sixreserves, to underscore his and Michael Dukakis's support for theprogram which eventually will put 750 million barrels of oil instorage.   Bentsen, in shirtsleeves and a gold-colored hard hat with ``Sen.Bentsen'' on the front, told a group of about 50 workers at theplant that the reserve is crucial to the national security and saidhe would like to expand it to a billion barrels.   The Reagan administration has proposed cut in the program in thepast, and Bentsen said only the Democratic Congress was able tokeep it going.   Bentsen has been campaiging in his home state while theRepublicans hold their convention in New Orleans and dominate thenational news.   Asked about the president's speech Monday night to theconvention, Bentsen said Reagan had ``an adoring crowd, and theyenjoyed each other.''   ``I also believe that in the convention, and after theconvention, as we go into the election, that it's George Bushpeople are looking to, not Ronald Reagan,'' he said. ``And RonaldReagan's coattails will be very short.''   Bentsen said there is a yawning gap between the Republicanrhetoric and reality, including Reagan's charge that the Democrats'speciality is inflation.   ``Inflation is in the trade deficit,'' Bentsen said, citingTuesday's news that the trade gap had jumped back to $12.5 billionin June.</TEXT></DOC>
