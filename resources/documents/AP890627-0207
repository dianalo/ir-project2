His announcement came as efforts already were advancing inCongress to condemn last week's decision extending First Amendmentfree speech rights to protesters who burn the flag.   The House voted 411-5 Tuesday night for a resolution thatexpressed ``profound concern'' over the court decision and calledfor ``continued commitment to preserving the honor and integrity ofthe flag as a living symbol of our nation.''   The resolution, whose chief sponsor was House Judiciary CommitteeChairman Jack Brooks, D-Texas, also ``condemns all actions intendedto desecrate the American flag'' and urged Americans to display theflag.   Brooks said the committee would begin hearings soon to ``examinethe matter from the standpoint of the need for constitutionalamendment or statutory remedies.''   House members used the resolution to vent their feelings. Rep.Carroll Hubbard Jr., D-Ky., said those who burn the flag should``consider moving to Iran, China or Cuba, where burning the flag ...is encouraged.''   But Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., deploring desecration of the flag,said the court acted correctly: ``I exult in the decision ...because the Supreme Court has has validated once again theConstitution and the Bill of Rights.''   ``We should be careful of a reckless tampering with theConstitution,'' he said.   Voting against the resolution were Reps. Weiss; Gus Savage,D-Ill.; Ronald Dellums, D-Calif.; William Clay, D-Mo., and George W.Crockett Jr., D-Mich.   Bush, who made patriotism, the flag and the pledge of allegiancea central theme in his 1988 presidential campaign, asserted, ``Ithink respect for the flag transcends political party and I thinkwhat I've said here is American. It isn't Republican or Democrat, itisn't liberal or conservative.''   He said adding an amendment to the Constitution would be the onlyfoolproof way to set aside the Supreme Court ruling, which nullifiedflag-desecration laws in 48 states.   However, the process is a lengthy one _ requiring two-thirdsvotes in both House and Senate and then ratification by no less than38 state legislatures. In the Constitution's 200-year history,thousands of amendments have been proposed but only 26 have beenratified.   Still, Bush said, ``the importance of this issue compels me tocall for a constitutional amendment.''   ``Support for the First Amendment need not extend to desecrationof the American flag,'' he added. ``Protection of the flag _ aunique national symbol _ will in no way limit the opportunity northe breadth of protest available in the exercise of free speechrights.''   Bush's comments were praised by conservatives but denounced bycivil-liberties groups.   ``We think it violates the fundamental principle of this nationthat every person has a right to express their views and expressthem in a way they choose, no matter how obnoxious the majority findthose views,'' said Morton Halperin, Washington director of theAmerican Civil Liberties Union.   David Cole, staff attorney for the Center for ConstitutionalRights, said: ``The First Amendment has survived for 200 yearswithout exceptions. It is outrageous for the president to urge thatwe deviate from the fundamental principles of toleration and freedomof expression.''   Last week, the Senate by voice vote added language to child-carelegislation that would make desecration of the flag punishable by amaximum $1,000 fine and a year in prison.   However, this language would not be added to the Constitution andtherefore could be overturned by the Supreme Court.   Senators also voted 97-3 for a resolution expressing ``profounddisappointment'' in the court ruling and pledging to ``seek ways torestore sanctions against such reprehensible conduct.''   A number of proposed constitutional amendments on the subjecthave been introduced in both houses. No hearings have yet beenscheduled.   House Republican Leader Bob Michel said he supported Bush's calleven though he harbored an ``instinctive conservative's dislike'' ofameding the Constitution.   The court decision ``leaves me with no alternative,'' Michel said.   ``Unfurl the flag, fly it, flaunt it, argue about it if you wantto, but don't desecrate it _ that's all we're asking. Surely thatview reflects the common sense of the American people,'' Michel said.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., one of numerous lawmakers to proposeconstitutional amendments to overturn the decision, said, ``With thepresident's backing I intend to move forward expeditiously. Thisegregious decision by the court must be corrected.''   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., who has criticized the courtdecision while voicing objections to amending the Constitution tooverturn it, reacted angrily to suggestions that Republicans couldmake flag burning a partisan issue if Democrats fail to support aconstitutional amendment.   ``I'm sure people will play politics with any emotional issue,''Foley said. But he added that anyone who does so with the flag issuewould be ``playing the most cynical politics ... for the most baseand crass political purposes.''   In his 1988 campaign, Bush frequently blasted Democratic opponentGov. Michael Dukakis for vetoing a Massachusetts law requiringpublic school teachers to lead their classes in the pledge ofallegiance.   Bush said during the campaign that, if he had been governor, hewould have found ways to make the law stick. He reinforced his themeby visiting a flag factory.   On Tuesday, asked if he hadn't used the flag for partisanpurposes during that campaign, Bush responded: ``Everything I didlast year was for the purpose of advancing my _ everything I didpolitically _ advancing my election. But I didn't put it on thebasis that Republicans are for the flag and Democrats are not.''   On another court-related topic, Bush was asked about recentSupreme Court rulings on affirmative action that have drawncriticism from civil rights groups _ rulings making it harder foremployees to bring discrimination cases against employers.   Bush said he had been assured by Attorney General Dick Thornburghthat follow-up legislation was unnecessary.</TEXT></DOC>
