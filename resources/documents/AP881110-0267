Texas plants are operating at full capacity along the Gulf coast,and are announcing expansions because they're running out of room toproduce ethylene and other basic petrochemicals.   The resurgence of the business comes at a time when the Texaseconomy is feeling the pinch of lower crude oil prices. But likeother ``downstream'' refining and processing operations,petrochemicals are benefiting from lower prices for raw materials.   Petrochemicals are derivatives of crude that are used in a widerange of consumer and industrial products. The list goes on and on:plastic bags, automobile springs, water pipes, computer chips,paints, medicines, carpets, clothes, shoes, luggage, furniture, heatshields for rockets _ even diapers, made of polypropylene.   ``In my opinion, it's the bright star in the Texas economy,''said state Comptroller Bob Bullock.   The Houston Economic Development Council says 70 plant expansionsvalued at a total of $4 billion have been announced for completionby 1991 from Corpus Christi to Louisiana, a 250-mile stretch ofcoastline that supplies two-thirds of the nation's majorpetrochemicals.   Some of the biggest include a $600 million Dow USA ethylene plantat Freeport, Texas, and three Quantum Chemical Corp. ethylene andpolyethylene projects worth $400 million in Houston.   The council said the proposed Formosa Plastic Corp. USA plant atPoint Comfort, Texas, a $3 billion complex, is scheduled forcompletion by 1993. The project would create 1,500 jobs and have anannual payroll of $85 million.   Analysts estimate that in so-called bulk chemicals, such asethylene, a $1 million investment equals only one new job. But evenso, the petrochemical industry ``pumped more than $2 billion inwages and salaries into the Texas economy in 1987,'' according tothe state comptroller's office.   Dr. Charles Holland, professor emeritus at Texas Aandamp;M Universityand president of the Texas Institute for Advancement of ChemicalTechnology, called Texas ``the high-tech chemical center of theworld.''   The initial petrochemical boom came with the need for syntheticrubber and antiknock gasoline in World War II. It grew until the1970s when the Arab oil embargo and worldwide overcapacity set itback.   The industry retrenched again during the 1981-82 recession, whenthe oil companies cut costs, closed plants and laid off workers.   In addition to lower crude prices, a decline in the value of thedollar has contributed to the industry's recent recovery. Senioreconomist Thomas Plaut of the comptroller's Economic Analysis Centersaid the dollar's 30 to 40 percent drop from the middle of 1985 tothe beginning of 1987 helped revive the export business by makingU.S. petrochemical products more competitive in world markets.   ``Out of something bad comes something good,'' observed Bullock,noting how when oil prices are down, petrochemicals pick up.   Petrochemical exports from Texas in 1984 totaled $3.9 billion, 35percent of the value of all manufacturing exports from the state,Plaut says.   Texas had 45,749 jobs in petrochemicals in the first quarter of1988, up 1,081 jobs, or 2.4 percent over the same period last year,the comptroller said.   Another 30,000 Texans were employed in petrochemical-related jobs.   According to Holland of Aandamp;M, the Texas chemical industry and itsassociated consumer product industries support 11 percent of thenation's gross national product.   The chemical engineering professor believes the chemical industry_ not computers, electronics, or space _ may be the best bet forTexas' economic future.   However, Holland says, the public perception of all chemicals as``bottles of fuming, smelly liquids, or poisonous gases'' must bechanged.   ``In times past,'' he said, ``the industry's position (on risks)was not to say much _ `Let the public relations guy handle it.' Now,the industry is much more public-conscious minded and feels it isbetter to tell all.''   Holland says continued petrochemical growth is expectedthroughout the 1990s, with a 65 percent increase in production over1982 recession levels by 1995.   The value of an $18 barrel of crude oil increases to $21 whenconverted in Texas to gasoline and $54 when converted to chemicals,he said. The figure ranges from $840 to $2,700 per barrel when thepotential value of consumer products made with chemicals isestimated.   Developing its own consumer product industry ``constitutes one ofTexas' greatest opportunities,'' Holland said. Those industrieswould not have to be located near the chemical complexes but couldbe inland, in any part of the state.   Such industries might produce furniture, wall coverings,textiles, bottles or paints.   ``Everything that you lay your eyes on in a modern building cameout of a chemical plant or was touched by chemicals,'' said Holland.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday Nov. 14</NOTE></DOC>
