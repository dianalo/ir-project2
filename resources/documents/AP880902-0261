The Labor Department said the number of jobless Americans jumpedby 226,000 to 6,851,000 in August while the number of those withjobs rose by only 121,000 to 115,180,000.   The 0.2 percentage point increase from July's civilian joblessrate of 5.4 percent followed a 0.1 percent rise from June's 14-yearlow of 5.3 percent.   The report sparked a rally on Wall Street. The Dow Jones averageof 30 industrial stocks climbed sharply in early trading asinvestors apparently viewed the unemployment rise as reducingupward pressure on interest rates and inflation.   Most of the increased joblessness was suffered by adult men,with their unemployment rate rising 0.4 percentage points to 4.9percent. The jobless rate among adult women, meanwhile, fell from5.1 percent to 4.8 percent, the   A separate survey of business payrolls _ which many economistsconsider a more reliable indicator of the economy's health _ showed219,000 new jobs in August, well below the 400,000 average monthlyincrease in June and July.</TEXT><TEXT>   Labor Department said.   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper, in California with thevacationing president, called the report ``good news.''   ``The continued strong gains in August payroll employmentconfirm that the longest peacetime expansion in U.S. historycontinued through its 69th month,'' the spokesman said.   Despite the increase in unemployment, Cooper said theadministration was cheered by ``the good numbers underneath theoverall numbers,'' such as in the jobless rate for women.   The last time the civilian unemployment rate was at 5.6 percentwas in May.   The goods-producing side of the economy lost jobs for the firsttime since last January, with employment in manufacturing droppingby 5,000 after a 70,000 jump in July.   The Labor Department said small employment gains in printing andpublishing and export-related industries such as machinery andelectrical equipment were more than offset by 9,000 job losses intextile and apparel plants and smaller declines in several othermanufacturing industries.   Employment in oil and gas drilling also declined slightly, butit rose a minuscule 3,000 jobs in construction.   On the services side of the economy, large monthly increases inretail trade hiring _ 80,000 in July alone _ slowed to just 23,000new jobs last month, virtually all in grocery stores.   Other recent high-growth job areas also slowed. Businessservices such as temporary help firms added just 16,000 newworkers, compared with average monthly increases of 60,000 throughthe spring and early summer.   New employment in health services, which the government predictswill be the largest area of job growth in the 1990s as the BabyBoom population ages, slowed to 22,000 in August. It also had beenrising an average 30,000 a month in the past year.   ``The labor market showed less strength in August than earlierin the year,'' said Labor Statistics Commissioner Janet L. Norwood.``Looked at over a somewhat longer period, however, the rate hashovered in the 5.3 percent to 5.6 percent range since last Marchand is 0.4 percentage point below the leval a year ago.''   Ms. Norwood said one encouraging sign was that the number ofpeople working part-time involuntarily because they could not findfull-time jobs ``returned to the bottom of the 5.2 million to 5.6million range within which it has been fluctuating for more than ayear.''   ``The proportion of working-age persons holding jobs remained atits record level of 62.3 percent,'' Ms. Norwood told the JointEconomic Committee of Congress.   Other data in the report, however, suggested that the economymight be slowing. The average workweek declined by 20 minutes to34.6 hours and manufacturing overtime fell by 0.1 hours to 3.8hours a week on average.   That sent weekly earnings down nearly a full percentage point asaverage hourly wages for non-supervisory workers held steady at$9.24.   In the past 12 months, the Labor Department said, wages haverisen an average of only 3.1 percent, decreasing the buying powerof workers, after taking inflation into account, by half a percent.   A separate calculation that includes the 1.7 million uniformedarmed forces in the job market showed a jobless rate of 5.5 percentlast month, up from 5.4 percent in July.   The government offered this other figures on unemployment inAugust:   Whites, 4.9 percent, up from 4.7 percent in July.   Blacks, 11.3 percent, down from 11.4 percent.   Hispanics, 8.4 percent, up from 8 percent.   Teen-agers, 15.8 percent, up from 15.2 percent.   Black teen-gers, 15.8 percent, up from 15.2 percent.   Private analysts had anticipated the overall jobless rate mightrise prior to today's report.   ``I think we're going to be stuck near 5.5 percent for the restof the year,'' said Roger Brinner of Data Resources Inc., aLexington, Mass., economic consulting firm. ``Employment is notgoing to fall; it's just not going to rise as fast as it has been.''   Brinner, like other economists, believes too many people, manyof them with only marginal skills, have been hired in recent monthsin relation to the rate of economic growth.   ``We may be at the point where we have absorbed most of labor'sskilled capacity,'' said Charles Renfro, chief economist for theforecasting firm of Alphametrics, also of Bala Cynwyd. ``Anythingless than an uptick in the jobless rate will be a real danger signthat the economy is overheating.''   Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch, noted that newclaims for unemployment compensation rose slightly last month, anindication of increased layoffs in some areas.   Steinberg believes there is still room for the jobless rate tofall over the next several months, ``but not in August.''</TEXT></DOC>
