Results of a study showed that by 1987 a larger proportion ofconvicted defendants received prison terms from federal judges andtheir sentences were on average 11 months longer than those imposedin 1980, the department said.   The number of criminal defendants convicted in federal courtsnationwide increased from 29,943 in 1980 to 44,518 percent in 1987,according to a study prepared by the Justice Department's Bureau ofJustice Statistics.   The conviction rate for defendants prosecuted in federal courtsincreased from 76 percent in 1980 to 81 percent in 1987, the studysaid.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a statement that thefigures demonstrated the need for more money to build additionalprisons to house the increasing numbers of convicted defendantssent behind bars by federal judges.   President Bush has proposed spending $1.5 billion to add 24,000beds to the overcrowded federal prison system.   Federal judges sent 13,766 convicted defendants to prison in1980 and ordered the imprisonment of 23,579 in 1987, the study said.   The proportion of criminal defendants sentenced to prisonincreased from 46 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in 1987 and theaverage term of incarceration grew by 11 months between the twoyears, the study said.   During this period, the average sentence for federal crimesincreased from 44.3 months in 1980 to 55.2 months in 1987, thestudy said.   The number of defendants convicted of drug offenses increased161.4 percent from 5,135 to 13,423, according to the study, whichwas based on figures from U.S. attorneys' offices and theAdministrative Office of U.S. Courts.   The average sentence for drug offenders was 21 months longer in1987 than it was in 1980. The average sentence for non-drug crimeswas only two months longer in 1987 than in 1980.   By far, the category of drug crimes showed the biggest increasein the number of defendants convicted in U.S. district courts,followed by a 55.1 percent increase in people convicted of fraud,forgery and counterfeiting.   Convictions for offenses such as tax fraud, racketeering,extortion and weapons violations increased 21.9 percent during theperiod.   ``These figures indicate that the federal criminal justicesystem has responded forcefully to the increase in crime,especially in the area of drug trafficking,'' Thornburgh said.</TEXT></DOC>
