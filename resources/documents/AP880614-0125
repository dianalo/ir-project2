The Rev. Vito Bracone said he was disappointed that Gov. RobertD. Orr, who had previous engagements, did not accept the petitionsin person. Instead, Bracone met with an aide to the governor andwith the convicted murderer, Paula R. Cooper, 18.   The petition drive in Italy began in November 1986 to winclemency for Cooper, of Gary, who was sentenced to die in Indiana'selectric chair for a 1985 robbery and stabbing.   Pope John Paul II announced last September that he, too, wouldlike to see Cooper granted clemency.   Orr, leaving his office to fulfill two speaking engagements,said Bracone and the Amnesty International members accompanying theFranciscan monk hadn't called to ask for a meeting.   If they had, Orr said he's not sure he would have met withBracone because Cooper's appeal is pending.   ``The issue is still before the judiciary,'' he said. ``Untilthey've completed their work, I think it would be inappropriate forme to get involved.''   The governor has the authority to commute a sentence at anytime. But Orr has not yet received a direct commutation requestfrom Cooper's lawyers, who still have an appeal pending before thestate Supreme Court.   Bracone, at a news conference outside the Statehouse, said heonly wanted a dialogue with the governor.   ``I don't see why we cannot talk. I don't want to put anypressure on him,'' said Bracone.   Michael K. Sutherlin, a local Amnesty International spokesman,said the group might try later to arrange to present the petitionsto Orr.   He also pledged that the organization would try during the 1989General Assembly to have the death penalty repealed. AmnestyInternational believes the death penalty is a human rightsviolation.   Orr said he believes the death penalty still has broad publicsupport in Indiana.   During the 1987 legislative session, Amnesty International andother groups including the Indiana Catholic Conference lobbiedsuccessfully for a bill to raise to 16 from 10 the minimum age of aperson who could be sentenced to death.   The new law does not affect Cooper, who was 15 at the time ofthe 1985 stabbing and robbery of Ruth E. Pelke, 78, of Gary. Threeother teen-agers were also convicted of related crimes in theslaying, but none of the others was sentenced to die.   Mrs. Pelke's grandson, William Pelke of Portage, has called forCooper to be granted clemency. He accompanied Bracone to theStatehouse Tuesday.   Bracone and the Rev. Justin Belitz, a Franciscan priest fromIndianapolis, met with Cooper at the Indiana Women's Prison inIndianapolis. She told them she is taking college-levelcorrespondence courses from a Bible college in Fort Wayne and soonwill take courses from Indiana University.   Cooper said she would like eventually to study psychology andwork with children.</TEXT></DOC>
