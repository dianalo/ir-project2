The deeply-divided Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesas expected announced Tuesday it would extend through the end ofthis year its accord to limit daily output to 15.06 millionbarrels, even though it expects oil demand to grow.   The limit is intended to control supplies and help push oilprices to the cartel's target price of $18 a barrel.   OPEC actually produces 18.5 million barrels daily, partlybecause of cheating by individual nations and partly because theceiling, which the cartel last December had extended through June30, excludes Iraq.   Iraq refuses to sign the accord because it wants a quotaequalling that of Iran, its war enemy since 1980.   News of the extension, reached at the cartel's regular mid-yearmeeting, immediately buoyed the oil markets.   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude oil, rose 40 cents to close at $16.83 a barrel Tuesdayon the New York Mercantile Exchange.   The contract had dropped 90 cents over the preceding threesessions, amid skepticism that the cartel would take anysubstantial steps to help boost prices and jitters of a potentialprice war.   But analysts were divided about what the meeting's outcome wouldmean for oil prices in coming months.   Paul Mlotok, an oil analyst with the New York investment firmSalomon Brothers Inc., said the meeting ``came out pretty much asyou would have expected.''   Philip Morgan, an oil analyst with the London investment firmWarburg Securties, said, ``The factions were just too divided tocome to any conclusion other than this.''   Both analysts indicated many market watchers were relieved thatthe cartel was able simply to agree on the extension, given itsinternal frictions.   ``There was the possibility for serious trouble,'' Mlotok said.   OPEC has split into two key factions, with the majority, led byVenezuela, pressing to cut production to boost prices closer to thetarget level.   A minority, led by powerful Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largestproducer, has wanted to increase production to take advantage of anexpected increase in demand during the rest of the year and tomaintain market share.   Rilwanu Lukman, the Nigerian oil minister who serves as cartelpresident, said at the meeting's conclusion that the expectedincrease in demand made OPEC optimistic that oil prices wouldincrease to $18 a barrel by year's end.   Citing that anticipated demand increase, Mlotok and Morgan saidthey expected oil prices to hold in a range of $16 a barrel to $18a barrel over the next few months.   McDonald said the output pact extension ``will keep them limpingalong at $15 a barrel until the next meeting,'' which the ministersscheduled for Nov. 21.   But John Toalster, an oil analyst with the London investmentfirm Hoare Govett Ltd., said the meeting's outcome was ``kind of afudged issue'' because there had been no commitment to cutproduction.   Saudi Arabia views the target price as a ceiling and sees $14 abarrel as a floor price, Toalster said.   Those factors, plus the cartel's overproduction during a periodof high oil stock levels, will depress prices to below $14 a barrelin the near term, Toalster speculated.   ``It really will be a testing time in the next few weeks,''Toalster said.   OPEC's members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
