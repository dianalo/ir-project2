<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0259 </DOCNO><TEXT>The anomalous low-field magnetic properties of the high-T{sub c} oxidecrystals have been interpreted alternatively in terms of a superconductiveglass state or, more recently, giant flux creep. The glass picture asproposed assumes the occurrence of intragranular Josephson junctionson a length scale small compared to the penetration depth, and has beenused to explain the properties of both single-crystal and ceramic samples.The flux creep picture deals only with pinning forces and ignores weaklinks, and thus far has been applied only to single crystals. We showhere that neither of these models adequately describes the behavior ofceramic materials. A physically accurate picture of such materials musttake into account intergranular Josephson junctions and resultant graindecoupling at low magnetic fields. 15 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
