Gorbachev said in a speechpublished Sunday the Kremlin is besieged by financial problems thatmay require a cut in defense spending and are sapping public faithin his reform efforts.   Gorbachev's speech to writers, editors and artists painted apicture of a leadership struggling to solve budget deficits, improvelabor productivity and implement price reforms while consumers blamereforms for shortages.   In the speech, published in the Communist Party daily Pravda, theSoviet president complained that intellectuals spend too much timebickering among themselves.   ``People are talking about a lack of goods, food, about queues,about the housing problem, about deficits of services ... and otherspheres that touch the everyday lives of people,'' Gorbachev said.   ``And the thing is that the criticism is not just of thesedeficits. People directly connect it with perestroika, they say thatso far it has provided nothing socially or economically, that inmany cases the situation even has gotten worse,'' he said.   Gorbachev said the Kremlin's budgetary problems were so acutethat ``we will have to look at our expenditures on defense.   ``Preliminary study shows that we can cut (defense), notlessening the level of safety and defense preparedness of thegovernment,'' he said.   The Soviet leader has said many times in the past that he wantsto lessen international tension in order to devote more resources tohis domestic reforms.   On Dec. 7, Gorbachev announced a unilateral cut in Sovietmilitary forces. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shervardnadze saidSunday in Paris the Soviet Union will destroy its stockpiles ofchemical weapons starting this year.   In contrast to many other pronouncements about perestroika, hisreform program, Gorbachev directly defended his policies againstspecific complaints.   Gorbachev's speech Friday and a subsequent question-and-answersession with writers, scientists, artists and editors filled thefront page of Sunday's edition of Pravda and took up slightly morethan half of the paper's six pages.   Gorbachev called budget deficits the ``gravest heritage'' of hispredecessors, whom he accused of ``carefully hiding (the deficits)from society'' until they were revealed this fall.   The Soviet leader gave no names, but he has been particularlycritical of the 18-year rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev, who died in 1982.   The Soviet Union passed a 1989 budget last fall that runs $58billion in the red, and government officials said the budget hadbeen out of balance for a decade. Gorbachev said the situation hadonly worsened during his nearly four years in power.   The government lost $60 billion in income in 1985-1988 becauseworld oil prices fell and lost another $78 billion because of hiscuts in production and sale of alcoholic beverages, Gorbachev said.   The Chernobyl nuclear power disaster, the Armenian earthquake andthe Soviet Union's involvement in Afghanistan also are draininglarge amounts of money, he said.   In addition, officials have not been able to halt a 20-yearspiral in which wages have risen faster than labor productivity, nordecide how to reform prices, Gorbachev said.   He credited his reforms with boosting labor productivity 5.1percent in 1988. Many other areas of the economy are improving, butnot fast enough, he said.   Previous Soviet leaders spread too much money over too manydevelopment projects that have not produced anything, Gorbachev said.   Gorbachev renewed his pledge that price reforms would not lowerworkers' standard of living, but he added that the problem was sodifficult that several officials had changed their minds more thanonce in the last few months about how to solve it.   ``I want to stress that we are far from thinking that everythingis already clear to us,'' Gorbachev said.   But he said it was also wrong to think the Kremlin leadership``does not have a program worked out.''   The Soviet president defended his policies from critics who hesaid ``feel nostalgic for the `good old days,' '' and a ``firmhand,'' an apparent reference to the years of dictator Josef Stalin.   Gorbachev also said a special commission of the ruling CommunistParty Politburo will finish debate on ethnic unrest in the republicsof Armenia and Azerbaijan on Jan. 11. The work of the commission,which began in early December, was delayed by the Dec. 7 earthquakein Armenia.</TEXT></DOC>
