A minimal coupingintroduces the interactions and the equation is converted into Rayleigh-Ritzform for the mass eigenvalue. This equation is then solved variationallyfor the lowest lying glueballs for several QCD motivated potentials.This results in a O++ ground state gluonium with a mass of 1623 Mev.The equation is also used for a three-body 2 + 1 model which yields avalue of 1500 Mev for the lowest lying value.</TEXT></DOC>
