As a result, downward adjustment in uranium contractprices should help reduce nuclear energy costs, saiddelegates at a recent conference here of the UraniumInstitute, a producer and consumer industry group.</LP><TEXT>   Spot uranium prices at $8.75 a pound are down from $43 apound in 1980 and are trading around the lowest levels in 17years, says Nuexco, an international nuclear fuel trader.   Sales from the Soviet Union, China and Western stockpilescontinue to place pressure on prices, even though demand isexceeding current production, delegates at the conferencesaid.   In the longer term, the &quot;Trojan horse&quot; of the uraniummarket might well be disarmament treaties between East andWest, says Phillip Crowson, chief economist at RTZ Corp. anda member of the supply/demand committee of the UraniumInstitute.   Military stockpiles and warheads of the U.S., SovietUnion, Britain, France, China and India hold the equivalentof 250,000 metric tons of natural uranium, Mr. Crowson said.That's enough to supply Western nuclear reactors for fiveyears, he said.   So far there aren't any indications there will besignificant transfers from military stockpiles to commercialindustries in the next few years, Mr. Crowson said. Yet themere knowledge of the inventories is a psychologicaldampener, he said.   The U.S. Energy Department signaled that some of itsstrategic stockpile is in excess of U.S. needs, Mr. Crowsonsaid, and as much as 50% of the West German stockpile waspurchased by a trader for sale.   About 150,000 tons of uranium exists in the present Sovietstrategic inventory, said Earl Hoellen, president of Nuexco.Three-fifths of this stockpile is in the hands of themilitary, he said. It is in the form of highly enricheduranium and probably isn't available for commercial use, Mr.Hoellen said.   Yet he estimates that 15,000 tons of Soviet uraniuminventories will be available for sale, leaving the balanceas reserve for domestic power production.   So far, however, declared uranium-export goals of theSoviet Union and China are 5,000 and 1,000 metric tons,respectively, the Uranium Institute said.   It estimates that there are nearly 80,000 tons of excessinventory held by power utilities in North America, WesternEurope and East Asia. Moreover, a poll of producers indicatesthat their excess inventories represents about 54 weeks ofoutput, the institute said.   The market depression is placing acute pressure onproducers, delegates said.   Responding to the price slump, annual world productionfell to 25,500 metric tons from 43,800 in 1980, said PhillipShirvington, general manager of marketing at Energy Resourcesof Australia Ltd.   &quot;In the eight leading producer countries the number ofoperating mines fell to only 73 in 1990 from 318 in 1981,&quot;Mr. Shirvington said. In the U.S. alone, the number ofoperating mines declined to 18 in 1990 from 254 in 1981, hesaid.   The 76% production cutback in the U.S. pulled output ofuranium down to 3,077 tons from 16,800 in the past decade, hesaid.   &quot;Industrywide employment plummeted to 1,300 in 1990 from apeak of over 22,000 in 1979,&quot; said Dennis E. Stover, directorof ISL Technology at Rio Algom Mining Corp. At the start ofthe 1980s, all major oil companies, including AtlanticRichfield Co., Exxon Corp., Tenneco Inc., Amoco Corp. andMobil Corp. were involved in uranium exploration andproduction, he said.   &quot;With the pending sale of Chevron assets, we see the lastof these companies depart&quot; from the uranium business, Mr.Stover said.   However, Canadian and Australian production rose becauseof commitments to develop new mines, Mr. Shirvington said.   The slide in uranium production pulled output levels farbelow utility demands, analysts said.   World uranium requirements, currently at 47,000 metrictons, are about 21,000 tons higher than present production,Mr. Crowson of RTZ said.   He forecasts nuclear reactors will need 66,000 metric tonsof uranium in the year 2010.   The cumulative shortage of production in relation toconsumption, however, will be easily met by excessinventories, the institute says. In the longer term, stockswill run down, Mr. Shirvington of Energy Resources says, andprices will rise, which will soon encourage more production.   With huge reserves above and below ground there won't be ashortage of uranium, delegates say.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Livestock and Meats                                                                                                          Cattle and hog futures prices are expected to be somewhatvolatile this week, as the market factors in last week'scurtailed cattle slaughter and huge hog slaughter. Amongother things, traders will focus on an Agriculture Departmentcattle-on-feed report due out Wednesday, looking for an endto uncertainty over how rapidly cattle were placed on feed inAugust.   In addition, with three major meatpacking housescurtailing slaughter last week, traders will watch to seewhether the delay in slaughter produced bigger cattle, whosebulk could exert downward pressure on futures prices. Cattlefutures are trading about 3.50 cents higher a pound than cashcattle prices, and the market will be trying this week to getthe two prices more in line in preparation for the Oct. 1delivery date for the October cattle contract. In hogtrading, traders will watch to see how well the marketabsorbs last week's huge pork production. At 1,815,000 hogskilled, slaughter last week was higher than during any otherweek this year, said Jerry Abbenhaus, livestock analyst forA.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, St. Louis.                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          Petroleum futures trading this week will continue toanticipate the meeting of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries Sept. 24 in Geneva. As is often the casewith that group, various factions are already making theirpositions known and lobbying for support ahead of thegathering. Currently, traders seem most interested in theapparent differences of opinion between OPEC heavyweightsSaudi Arabia and Iran over fourth-quarter production levels.   Saudi Arabia has reportedly called for higher productionto keep prices down when demand picks up and to accommodatethe additional pumping that kingdom wants to do. Iran, thoughexpressing a much more moderate stance than in the past, hasbeen emphasizing the importance of keeping production down soas to boost the average price of the OPEC basket of crudeshigher than its current $19.05 a barrel.   Last week, Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh,seemed to be holding out for the $21 reference price thegroup agreed to in July 1990. But over the weekend, in aninterview with the newsletter Energy Compass, he suggestedthat &quot;$20 a barrel is also acceptable to us.&quot; The premeetingdebate had helped prop up prices, but Iran's willingness tohave the group increase production will put downward pressureon crude oil futures prices.                                                                                                          Coffee                                                                                                          The weather in Brazil and plans by producers to withholdcoffee from the market to boost prices will continue to bethe focus in the coffee market this week.   David Taylor, chief climatologist at Weather ServicesCorp. in Bedford, Mass., said traders might react today tolight, scattered showers in Brazil forecast for yesterday ortoday. But overall weather conditions are still much drierthan normal, he said.   Traders will also be watching for developments in theproposed producer export-retention plan. A U.S. officialexpressed skepticism that the plan, which calls for producersto withhold a percentage of coffee from the export market,will get off the ground. &quot;Nobody really thinks this schemewill work,&quot; he said. Policing the agreement will beimpossible, he said, noting that cheating was a problem underthe old international coffee quota agreement. &quot;It's beyondbelief that countries will observe {the retention plan}, ifthey didn't do it in the past,&quot; he said.   Moreover, the plan is an emergency measure that doesn'tlead to anything more substantial, such as a quota system, hesaid.   Coffee for September delivery ended Friday 1.9 cents apound lower at 87.75 cents, while the actively tradedDecember contract fell 1.65 cents to 91.45 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
