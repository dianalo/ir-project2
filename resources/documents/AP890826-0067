East Germans are flooding into West Germany, Moscow is grantingsome Soviet Jews their long-time wish to emigrate, and ethnic Turkshave fled in record numbers to Turkey from virtual persecution inBulgaria.   One immigration expert says the border-blurring flood may be thebiggest mass movement of Europeans since after World War II. Thebulk of the migration has been from the East bloc to the West, withmany taking advantage of looser travel restrictions to escapestagnant economies.   About 400,000 ethnic Germans from the Soviet Union and five otherEastern European countries are expected in West Germany this year.That marks an emotional homecoming for the descendants of settlerswho themselves sought a better life by heading eastward decades,even centuries ago.   ``I myself left the German Democratic Republic in 1952,'' saysWest German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of the newarrivals from that Communist nation. ``I know what's driving thesepeople on, and I know that no one makes a snap decision to flee.''   The number of East Germans reaching West Germany this year isexpected to hit 100,000, the highest number since 207,000 peoplearrived in 1961 when the Berlin Wall was built.   So far in 1989, the majority of the East Germans leaving behind agrowing sense of hopelessness in their bleak, pollution-riddencountry are emigrating legally.   But for those leaving without permission, the escapes can rangefrom a death-defying swim across a Berlin river to a sprint acrossthe border between Hungary and Austria.   Many of the refugees are young workers who will be sorely missedback in East Germany, a country of 16.6 million. On Saturday alone,more than 100 East Germans crossed illegally into Austria,authorities said.   East Germany intensified a media campaign aimed at stemming theflow of refugees to the West. The Communist Party daily, NeuesDeutschland, printed 23 letters it said it received from readerscriticizing West German media coverage of the exodus and warningEast Germans of an uncertain future in the West.   ``The West German media has become hysterical,'' the newspaperquoted a man identified as Hans-Dieter Stuck. ``They want tohoodwink young and old into giving up home and hearth.''   West Germany is the promised land for another current wave ofEuropean migrants _ ethnic Germans whose ancestors settled in whatis now the Soviet Union and other parts of Eastern Europegenerations ago.   ``Last year, we had 200,000 and this year we are counting on400,000,'' says Ina Ruehl, an expert with the West German Red Crossin Bonn.   The numbers she cited reflect the new arrivals from the SovietUnion, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.   ``After the war, it was 12 million people. That was the largestmovement,'' Ms. Ruehl said, referring to the exodus of Germans fromEastern Europe following the collapse of the Nazis' Third Reich.``So, this is really the second-biggest such movement.''   By comparison, up until 1987 only about 600 ethnic Germans wereallowed to emigrate from their homes in the harsh climes of Siberiaand Soviet Central Asia.   ``Emigration is regarded by many as the only possibility toremain Germans, to preserve their traditions, language andculture,'' the official Soviet news agency Tass said Aug. 17,summing up the views of a new organization representing theminority's interests.   Last week, the head of the Soviet Union's visa agency said thatdue to eased travel restrictions, 200,000 Soviets are expected toemigrate this year. Rudolf Kuznetsov said about 107,000 Sovietsalready have received permission to leave this year. Most of theemigrants go to the United States and West Germany.   The Soviets have begun to open the gates for the estimated 1.8million to 3 million Jews demanding the right to emigrate. Since1971, about 300,000 Soviet Jews have left.   Thousands have made their way to Italy by way of Vienna, hopingto eventually reach the United States. But while the United Statesused to welcome the Soviet Jews with open arms, that policy wastightened in October.   The ethnic Turks streaming out of Bulgaria are leaving behindofficial harassment bordering on outright persecution.   Bulgarian authorities have embarked on an assimiliation campaign,forcing the ethnic Turks to adopt Slavic names. The ethnic Turks saythey have been fined and beaten for speaking Turkish in public andfor practicing Islamic rites.   The number had climbed to more than 300,000 in three monthsbefore Ankara began clamping down last week in hopes of forcingconcessions from Bulgaria's Communist authorities.   About 30,000 Romanians, most of them ethnic Hungarians, have fledto Hungary over the past two years. The ethnic Hungarians alsodemand the right to use their language, and maintain their culturaltraditions are violated.   Hungary's willingness to take in the refugees _ and Budapest'schampioning of their rights _ have worsened the already strainedrelations between the two Warsaw Pact allies.   Sheer economic need often remains the greatest force for massiveinternal migrations within Europe, demonstrated by the millions ofTurks, Italians, Spaniards and others who have found work innorthern European countries over the last few decades.</TEXT></DOC>
