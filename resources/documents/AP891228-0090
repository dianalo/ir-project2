The rebels claim to be battling the Marxist government's troopsalong the nation's main north-south highway and are fighting within100 miles of the capital of Addis Ababa, Western diplomats saidThursday.   The escalating bloodshed comes as a devastating droughtthreatens to bring famine to 4 million people, most of them innorthern Ethiopia, where the rebels are based.   The rebels, the Tigre People's Liberation Front, say that in thelast 10 days they have captured the garrison town of Debre Tabor innorthwest Gonder province and the towns of Rabel and Mehal Meda inShoa province.   Addis Ababa is located in Shoa province.   Those battles, the insurgents said, have caused the governmentnearly 3,000 dead, wounded or captured soldiers.   Diplomats in Addis Ababa say the claims appear to be true andthat the rebels now are in control of the 25-mile road from DebreTabor to Lake Tana, source of the Blue Nile.   They say the rebels also are continuing their southern push inShoa and are battling government troops along the main north-southhighway around Debre Sine, 100 miles northeast of Addis Ababa.   ``It obviously looks like things are hotting up,'' said one ofthe diplomats, all of whom spoke in telephone interviews from AddisAbaba and requested anonymity. ``But what's going to happen, no oneknows.''   The rebels claimed the battle for Debre Tabor, where thegovernment garrison has been increased to 10,000 to 15,000 troops,was the beginning of a government counteroffensive to drive therebels back.   However, the diplomats were doubtful the government could mustermuch resistance.   ``I don't think we're looking at much of a governmentcounteroffensive at all, if they're even capable of making one,''said one diplomat. ``The government hasn't succeeded in pushingthem back to any degree.''   The source said President Mengistu Haile Mariam's army,disorganized and dispirited after a failed army-led coup attempt inMay, had been reinforced by hundreds of thousands of poorly trainedconscripts ``of dubious quality.''   ``I think the best they might be able to do is hold the rebelsin position,'' he said.   The Tigrean rebels began their offensive in August after joiningforces with a smaller rebel group, the Ethiopia People's DemocraticMovement.   They control all of their home province, Tigre, and have madesignificant advances into Tigre's southern neighbor, Wollo. In thelast two months they also have moved into Gonder and Shoa provinces.   ``They've proven to be much stronger, much more coherent thanthey were believed to be several months ago,'' said one of thediplomats. ``They've basically rolled over one government positionafter another.''   The Tigrean rebels have been fighting for 14 years to toppleMengistu's Marxist government. They themselves are Marxists who saythey want a government modeled after Albania's harshStalinist-Leninist rule.   Mengistu's government and the rebels have held two rounds ofpreliminary peace talks, the last of which ended Dec. 19 in Romewith both sides agreeing to meet in March.   However, the peace talks ``don't appear to be going very farnow,'' said a diplomat who pointed out that the latest offensivebegan immediately after the negotiating sessions ended.   He said there was speculation that the Tigrean rebels hadlaunched their ``one-two'' attack in Gonder and northern Shoa incoordination with another rebel group, the Eritrean People'sLiberation Front.   The diplomat said sources in the capital understood the Eritreanfront was planning an offensive in their province of Eritrea andthat the Tigre rebels were effectively pinning down governmentforces in preparation for that attack.   The Eritrean rebels, who have been fighting a 28-yearsecessionist battle for Eritrea, Ethiopia's northernmost province,fought their last major offensive in mid-1988. That push also wascoordinated with the Tigre rebels and resulted in the Eritreanrebels gaining much of Eritrea.   In addition to the fighting, the United Nations says northernEthiopia is again the scene of drought and famine.   On Wednesday, the United Nations called for an ``internationalrelief operation of major proportions'' and appealed for 700,000tons of food to prevent a repeat of the 1984-85 famine that killedan estimated 1 million.   Relief agencies have so far unsuccessfully appealed to therebels and Ethiopia's government to agree on air and groundcorridors through which supplies can move, unhindered by fighting.</TEXT></DOC>
