Exxon filed a half-page document Friday in federal courtin Anchorage, Alaska, withdrawing the pleas, which coveredfour misdemeanor counts of violating pollution andwildlife-protection laws.</LP><TEXT>   The move marked the demise of a painstakingly crafted pleaagreement that would have settled both criminal charges andcivil claims of the federal government and the state ofAlaska arising from the March 1989 spill. Under thatagreement, Exxon would have paid $100 million in criminalfines and as much as $1 billion for civil claims.   The agreement began to unravel April 24, when Judge H.Russel Holland ruled that the $100 million in criminal fineswasn't enough. The civil portion of the agreement thencollapsed when the Alaska House of Representatives voted itdown as inadequate.   Exxon now faces all of the charges originally broughtagainst it by the Justice Department, which include twofelony counts alleging recklessness and negligence on thepart of the corporation and its Exxon Shipping Co. unit. TheJustice Department has said that Exxon could be liable formore than $600 million if found guilty on all criminalcharges, although other attorneys involved in Exxon Valdezlitigation suggest the fines theoretically could range beyond$2 billion.   By withdrawing its guilty pleas, Exxon signaled it iswilling to take its chances before a jury, a risky strategygiven the unpredictability of jury trials and the possibilityof huge damage awards. But several attorneys, including someinvolved in Exxon Valdez litigation, said the move amounts toa shrewd stalling tactic that may still lead to a settlement.   For one thing, Exxon lawyers are likely to be able todelay a trial for months, during which time the clamor for asettlement from Alaska officials will likely increase. Gov.Walter Hickel, who was instrumental in working out theoriginal plea bargain, has been authorized by the legislatureto try again, and the political mood in the state seems tohave swung sharply back in favor of an expeditious settlementthat would avoid years of costly litigation.   &quot;We certainly continue to believe that a settlement isbest for everyone and we're pursuing that,&quot; said CharlesCole, Alaska's attorney general. Mr. Cole also acknowledgedthat without a settlement on the criminal charges, Exxonisn't likely to swiftly move to deal with civil claims.   Moreover, although Exxon won't comment, its lawyers areknown to believe that the government's case on the criminalcharges has holes in it. One person familiar with Exxon'slegal position said the company remains amenable to asettlement, but believes it would win at trial.   Such observations may in themselves simply be pressuretactics, but in the only trial related to the spill to date,Capt. Joseph Hazelwood, the skipper of the ill-fated ExxonValdez who was allegedly drunk when his ship slammed into areef and began spewing oil, was acquitted of all but theleast serious charges against him. And several environmentallawyers note that the felony charges facing Exxon, broughtunder such statutes as the Dangerous Cargoes Act, havesometimes been hard to prove.   &quot;You have to have proof of knowing and willful neglect,and that can be very tricky,&quot; said Joe Sax, a professor ofenvironmental law at the University of California atBerkeley.   The Justice Department has made it clear it prefers asettlement. In commenting on Exxon's plea withdrawal, RichardB. Stewart, the agency's chief environmental prosecutor, wentout of his way to bemoan the collapse of the original pleabargain. &quot;We deeply regret that the receipt of funds torestore the damaged environment appears to be years down theroad,&quot; he said. &quot;However, the U.S. remains willing toentertain any good-faith proposal by Exxon to resolve thismatter short of trial,&quot; he added.   One reason that many legal observers believe a settlementwill still emerge is that the risks of trial are enormous forall sides. Exxon could face huge damages and more disastrouspublicity if it fights a long trial and loses, but a defeatfor the government might be even more devastating. &quot;Thenightmare scenario {for the Justice Department} is that ittries the case and loses,&quot; said one attorney close to someExxon Valdez litigation. &quot;These charges were supposed to showhow this administration was serious about prosecutingenvironmental crimes. And in the public mind, this should bean open-and-shut case. Everybody saw those pictures of deadbirds.&quot;   If the case does go to trial, the outcome might finallyresolve the persistent mystery surrounding what actuallyhappened as the ship steamed toward disaster on a clear nightmore than two years ago. The government's case will turn onits ability to show that the Exxon Valdez struck the reefbecause of incompetent seamanship that the corporation itselfis at least partly responsible for, either because itemployed inept crew members, didn't properly supervise ortrain them or worked them too hard. In hearings before theNational Transportation Safety Board in 1989, much evidenceemerged to suggest all of those possibilities.   Lawyers said that one focus of the government's caselikely will be Robert Kagan, a helmsman who was at thecontrols when the supertanker crashed. Testimony at thesafety board hearings raised questions about Mr. Kagan'scapabilities. The company's handling of Mr. Hazelwood willalso be targeted; although Exxon knew Mr. Hazelwood had ahistory of drinking problems, the company continued to allowhim to pilot the huge supertankers. He wasn't on the bridgewhen the ship struck the reef and has admitted drinkingbefore boarding the vessel. Company decisions to cut back thenumber of crew members and increase their responsibilitiesand workload also will figure in the government's case,lawyers speculated.   Exxon's main line of defense would be to maintain that thespill was an accident, and that the Coast Guard contributedto it by not properly tracking the vessel as it strayed offcourse, attorneys involved in Exxon Valdez litigation said.Exxon attorneys will also probably attack the statutes underwhich the charges were brought.   ---   Paul M.
