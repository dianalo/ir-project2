Chairman Samuel Zell going respectable? Sort of.    The brash and bearded real estate bargain hunter and corporate raider, who has prided himself on his &quot;gravedancer&quot; nickname, Wednesday agreed to buy extensive holdings from Henley Group Inc., La Jolla, Calif. Some here view the move as an attempt to join Chicago's establishment.    &quot;One of the things he wants over time is respectability in the Chicago business community,&quot; said a top corporate lawyer who has dealt with Mr. Zell.    And indeed, Mr. Zell had some nice things to say about management of Santa Fe Southern Pacific Corp., in which Itel would gain a 16.9% stake as part of the $1.2 billion cash and stock transaction with Henley. And he didn't immediately demand a seat on the railroad, real estate and energy concern's board.    But Sam Zell, the motorcycle-riding, four-letter-word spewing, I-know-best investor, is still Sam Zell. So, in an interview early yesterday morning from a vacation home in Sun Valley, Idaho, Mr. Zell promptly termed Henley Chairman Michael D. Dingman, who will control 40% of Itel's stock as part of the agreement, &quot;just neutered&quot; by a standstill agreement that restricts for 10 years how Henley can vote or trade the stake.    Mr. Zell also said Henley would be distributing the 18.7 million new Itel shares to its shareholders, thereby breaking up the stake and its possible sway over Itel, a rail-car and container leasing, dredging and wire making concern. Mr. Dingman and Paul Montrone, Henley's president, will join Itel's board.    &quot;It's obvious the way the standstill agreement is written that the stock will be spun off to {Mr. Dingman's} stockholders,&quot; said Mr. Zell, who with partner Robert H. Lurie will retain a 21% Itel stake. &quot;There ain't nothing changed about the ownership {of Itel} or the control, other than we got two terrific directors.&quot;    Henley hastened to disagree. &quot;We intend to keep the stock,&quot; a spokesman said. Henley officials declined further comment on Mr. Zell's remarks.    So far, the Itel-Henley agreement doesn't sound like a marriage made in heaven. But then, Mr. Zell has been known to emerge from a corporate brawl smiling, wealthier and having gained at least the respect of some of the combatants.    On his way to gaining control of Itel, which emerged from bankruptcy-law protection in 1979, he angered several directors by screaming at them in meetings, but they ended up making him the boss.    Mr. Zell is also thrifty. He has managed to buy hundreds of millions of dollars of real estate at depressed prices, hold on, and reap big gains; he gave himself his &quot;gravedancer&quot; nickname for benefiting from others' mistakes.    Just now, Mr. Zell is using about $400 million raised from 21 institutional investors to buy property in places as depressed as Houston. He bristles when the operation is called a vulture fund, industry vernacular for such bottom fishing.    James D. Harper Jr., a big Chicago investor and former real estate lending chief at Continental Illinois Corp., said he lent hundreds of millions of dollars to Mr. Zell over the years, it was always repaid, and that Mr. Zell nearly always made out well.    The two men are friends -- Mr. Harper's son dates Mr. Zell's daughter, and the families live a block apart in high-rises here -- and they share a certain conceit in their real estate success. &quot;Sam can find more magic in these companies than Dingman,&quot; Mr. Harper said. &quot;Real estate guys always do better. They view industrial assets differently. Sam has never been a passive anything.&quot;    Mr. Zell yesterday was already talking about swapping his Santa Fe stake for some of that company's real estate or rail assets, or perhaps buying more Santa Fe stock. He hasn't decided, he said, and could end up selling the stake.    Even Mr. Harper detects a growing respectable streak in Mr. Zell. Before the Henley deal, Itel had completed more than $1 billion worth of acquisitions since 1985, and not always at the fire-sale prices Mr. Zell prefers. &quot;The day he bought Anixter Bros. Inc. {the wire maker, for about $500 million in 1986} is the first time he paid full price for anything. That marks the day he joined the establishment,&quot; he says.    But Mr. Zell is still a free spirit. When the Henley talks bogged down in June, he fled not to his investment bankers, but to Europe to ride his motorcycle. &quot;It gave me 10 days of peace,&quot; he said. &quot;It's just you and your helmet.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
