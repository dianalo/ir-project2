Linda Patrick, who said she had met Hurt for the first time,testified on the fourth day of a trial to determine whether theactor had a common-law marriage in South Carolina with formerballerina Sandra Jennings.   ``How do you like working with my wife?'' she quoted Hurt asasking about Jennings, mother of Hurt's son, Alexander, now 6.   The babysitter said that occasionally when she went for walkswith the boy, people would come up and say, ``How is Mrs. Hurt?''That comment was stricken from the record because it was not givenin response to a question.   Jennings, 32, bases her claim of a common-law marriage on fourweeks she spent with Hurt in Beaufort, S.C., from Dec. 9, 1982, whenhe learned he was divorced from actress Mary Beth Hurt, to Jan. 10,1983, when Hurt and Jennings left the state. Hurt was filming ``TheBig Chill'' there at the time.   Jennings now seeks to have the court declare that she and Hurtare married so she can get a ``divorce'' and a share of his assets,estimated by her lawyer, A. Richard Golub, to be about $10 million.   Patrick was another of several witnesses who have testified thatHurt called Jennings his wife, but no one has said he made such areference during the four-week period in South Carolina on whichJennings' claim is based.   South Carolina recognizes common-law marriages; New York does not.   The trial continues on Monday, when it is expected to conclude.</TEXT></DOC>
