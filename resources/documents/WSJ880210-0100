Indeed, the annual Wehrkunde Conference here of allied defense and legislative leaders was dominated by a sense of German self-pity and paranoia and questions about how Bonn's fears will affect the Western alliance. The German concerns provoked exasperation from the allies, as well as a determination to convince the Germans that their perceptions are both wrong and dangerous to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.    Germany's angst was most often described by a word that seems more appropriate to a psychiatric journal than a defense conference: singularization, a fear of being left vulnerable and alone. Under the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty with Moscow, the U.S. will withdraw from Germany and other European allies hundreds of intermediate-range missiles that can strike the Soviet Union within minutes. At the end of three years, the nuclear weapons remaining in West Germany will be short-range artillery, bombs and missiles with a reach of under 300 miles.    That done, the Germans fear, any nuclear war would be confined to the German plain, where the superpowers would fight each other without using long-range nuclear weapons, leaving their homelands safe and Germany devastated.    Haunted by these worries, Germans are pushing the U.S. to negotiate reductions in the short-range nuclear weapons -- at a time the rest of the Western alliance wants a pause to think about the wisdom of further nuclear disarmament. The Germans have also backed away from an earlier alliance commitment to accept newer and more capable short-range weapons.    What dismayed many delegates at last weekend's conference is that the German singularization complex challenges basic NATO doctrine, that an attack on one member is an attack on all. Moreover, the short-range nuclear weapons in Germany are there to deter the Soviet-dominated Warsaw Pact, with its larger conventional forces, from ever invading Western Europe. The Germans fear the weapons that were installed to spare them a large-scale conventional war, or any war at all.    Washington is leading a concerted campaign to change the German attitude. &quot;The concept of singularization is a counterproductive myth,&quot; U.S. ambassador to Germany Richard Burt told the conference.    If the arsenal of short-range nuclear weapons is allowed to become obsolete, Germany and the entire alliance will become more vulnerable to Soviet attack. If they weren't threatened by the battlefield nuclear weapons, Warsaw Pact forces massed on the German border could move in larger battle groups that would be harder for NATO conventional armies to stop. And, Germans would be killed sooner by Russian tanks and artillery. &quot;War is war; death is death,&quot; noted Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.).    The allies dispute Germany's contention that it is uniquely vulnerable. The focus on Germany as a nuclear battlefield ignores the nuclear risks other allies shoulder.    By 1990, there will be more nuclear weapons in France and Britain than in Germany. The Netherlands and Turkey also house nuclear arms. All these sites would be vulnerable to nuclear attack from long-range Soviet weapons.    &quot;You have to find polite ways to remind them that the concept of NATO is collective security,&quot; said one American in Munich. But things could become less polite. Sir John Gilbert, a British member of Parliament brought up World War II, remarking, &quot;I'm not weeping for Germany. After all, why do we have a divided Europe?&quot;    U.S. officials bristle that the Germans seem to overlook the U.S. strategic nuclear arsenal. &quot;The U.S. with its nuclear umbrella has offered itself as the battlefield,&quot; said a State Department official.    To be sure, German leaders don't speak with one voice on how to defend Europe once the INF accord takes effect. Chancellor Helmut Kohl wants to negotiate reductions in the short-range systems, and not accept updated short-range weapons until such talks are progressing. But Defense Minister Manfred Woerner wants to proceed with the modernization plan NATO planners have twice endorsed.    Germany's Social Democratic Party opposes the modernization of short-range forces, and party leaders say there is scant support for new nuclear weapons by the German public, only 24% of whom view the Soviet Union as a threat, polls indicate. </TEXT></DOC>
