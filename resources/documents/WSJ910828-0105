Now, onceagain, many feel there is hope for that troubled region. Apeace conference is likely, and prospects look good for therelease of more hostages.   It is not my intention to throw cold water on the &quot;goodnews.&quot; No one can fail to be impressed with the level ofcommitment and energy the U.S. has invested in the peaceprocess. And certainly all of us have long prayed for the daywhen those held captive, including hostages, can once againbreathe the air of freedom. But the new spirit of peace andcooperation that infuses these developments may prove only anillusion if similar and equally committed efforts to liberateLebanon are not undertaken.</LP><TEXT>   Lebanon has been transformed from an oasis of peace intothe principal arena of Arab-Israeli confrontation. Itsoccupation by Syrian forces, though they are clothed in theapparel of &quot;peacekeepers,&quot; means the continued proximity andconfrontation of antagonistic Syrian and Israeli forces.   This is, after all, not the first attempt at Middle Eastpeace, not the first moment of hope for success. Nor is thisthe first time there has been progress on the hostage issue.There have been previous releases. There have been previous&quot;serious and constructive efforts&quot; by Syria and Iran toliberate Western hostages. Yet, so long as Syria, Israel,Iran and the Palestinians occupy most of Lebanon, directly orindirectly, there can be no doubt that, as in the past, theSyrians and Iranians can turn the abductions on and off likea faucet.   Today, it is in their economic interest to turn the faucetoff and appear to be the West's saviors. But tomorrow? Theyretain their control over the land and people of Lebanon inpart to retain this option. Lebanon remains a key element inany program to achieve peace between Israel and the Arabs, aswell as in any effort to close the curtain on the tragicdrama of international terrorism.   Not only is Lebanon Israel's northern neighbor, it hostshundreds of thousands of Palestinian refugees. It thereforeshould participate in any regional conference, multilateralor bilateral.   Recent history has amply demonstrated that Lebanon is toosmall and vulnerable to take the lead, but it can and mustparticipate. It is in everyone's interest thatLebanese-Israeli relations progress from the armisticeestablished in 1949 to a real peace. Part and parcel of thisprogress must be agreement on several other issues: securityarrangements to safeguard both southern Lebanon and northernIsrael; normalization between the two countries as a part ofthe general settlement sought between Israel and the Arabworld as a whole; an accord on the future of the Palestinianscurrently residing in Lebanon; and, of course, cooperativework on regional development.   It was the centrifugal pressures of the regional conflictthat first ruptured the peace of Lebanon and then thrust thecountry into the maelstrom of internal conflict, or, moreaccurately, of an internalized regional conflict.   For Lebanon to play a constructive part and return to itsstabilizing role in the region, my country must recover itssovereignty, abducted by the Taef accord. Lebanon's part inregional peace and cooperation, if it is to be enduring, mustbe Lebanese-inspired, not Syrian-imposed.   Lebanon must have sovereignty. The Taef accords, signedOct. 24, 1989, in Saudi Arabia, institutionalized the foreignoccupying armies in Lebanon. The accord in effect accepts acontinuing Syrian military presence in Lebanon, and,predictably enough, the Israeli army in turn has now usedSyria's military presence to justify its own presence in thesouth.   The Taef accord failed to attack the most serious problemin Lebanon -- the foreign presence -- advocating only aredeployment of Syrian forces. The results are visible today,when it is evident that it is Syria above all that benefitsfrom the Taef accord. Syria determines who will be Lebanon'sprimary officials. Syria now even determines, through atragic caricature of democratic practice, Lebanon'sparliamentary deputies by deciding who will be appointed --appointed, not elected -- to fill our Parliament.   The Gulf War accelerated the erosion of Lebanesesovereignty. By supporting the coalition, Syria quietlyextended the control Taef made possible. Syria took advantageof the Gulf War to solidify its control of Lebanon. But ifthe accord opened the door to Syrian control, one more stepwas still required to consolidate it. This step was theconclusion, on May 22, of a &quot;Treaty of Brotherhood,Cooperation and Coordination,&quot; between Syria and theSyrian-imposed government of Lebanon, which creates a virtualconfederation that is clearly intended to lead ultimately topolitical union of Syria and Lebanon.   The treaty commits Syria to preserve the unity,independence and consensus of Lebanon, in effect providing aready excuse for Syria to intervene on a permanent basis. Asfor the &quot;equality&quot; of the two parties, which is proclaimed bythe text, this is the equality of a bully and his victim. Itis ironic that even as East Europe frees itself from unequal,colonizing &quot;treaties&quot; with the Soviet Union, Lebanon issubjected to this artifact of imperialism. Not surprisingly,there is no provision either for revision or for termination.   Lebanon's experience with Syria is instructive for thecause of regional peace. Syria, like Iran, has modified itsstyle toward the West now that it can no longer look to theSoviet Union for support. However, these are tactical andephemeral shifts; Syria has not changed, and its behavior inLebanon is the evidence.   While president, I reached numerous agreements with Syria,not one of which Damascus respected, always creatingincidents to reopen the issue. In Arabic we say, &quot;Take {whatyou can get}, then ask for more.&quot; And your own expressionrecognizing such an approach is correct: &quot;Give them an inchand they'll take a mile.&quot; This is the Syrian strategy, whichapplies as fully in the rest of the Middle East.   The West has been silent on Lebanon. Western powers haveshown no inclination to focus on a case where thetransgressions against international law, internationalcustom and the vaunted principles of the &quot;new world order&quot;have been at least as great as those of Iraq in Kuwait. Aslong as the foreign presence continues there can be nolasting peace in Lebanon. Only a basic intra-Lebaneseentente, concluded in isolation from pressure and rooted inrepresentative legitimacy, can effectively underpin a newLebanese order.   Any peace requires the withdrawal of all foreign forces.The restoration of Lebanese sovereignty also requires theconduct of internationally supervised free elections. Suchefforts have been successfully mounted elsewhere, and insurroundings far less hospitable to democratic practices thanLebanon.   International action is mandated in Lebanon, as in Kuwait,to restore the sovereignty of Lebanon within its recognizedborders and to block the conflicting hegemonic ambitions ofLebanon's neighbors. The United Nations, the Arab League,France and the U.S. remain the logical choices to exertpressure on our foreign occupiers. It is high time theinternational community showed its determination to put anend to the systematic and progressive extermination ofLebanese sovereignty. Without such an effort, steps at theregional level will prove mere mirages in the desert of humansuffering generated by the continuing violence of the MiddleEast.   ---   Mr. Gemayel was president of Lebanon, 1982-88.</TEXT></DOC>
