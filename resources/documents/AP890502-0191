Under an agreement with South Korea, the headquarters and otherU.S. bases in central Seoul will be moved by the mid-1990s, theministry said.   South Korea wants to relocate the bases to help meet growingdemands for new offices and homes in the crowded capital. TheAmericans promised to move the bases if South Korea providescomparable facilities elsewhere.   ``The first element of this plan calls for the early return ofthe 8th U.S. Army golf course during 1990, with the full relocationof the affected forces in (the) mid-1990s,'' the announcement said.   South Korean officials said they probably will convert thecourse into a public park.   The Seoul barracks have been headquarters of the 8th U.S. Armyand other American forces since the United States backed SouthKorea in the 1950-53 Korean War.   U.S. and South Korean officials agree political and economicchanges have caused South Korea to reassess its relationship withthe United States.   The two sides are negotiating the future of U.S. bases in SouthKorea, and South Korea wants to revise agreements to secure greaterjurisdiction over the 43,000 U.S. soldiers stationed under a mutualdefense pact.   A majority of South Koreans support the presence of U.S.soldiers in their country. U.S. officials say the forces willremain as long as their presence is desired by a majority of SouthKoreans.   Dissidents and radical students demand the immediate withdrawalof the U.S. troops, contending they hamper unification withcommunist North Korea.   Korea was divided in 1945, when U.S. and Soviet soldiersterminated Japan's colonial rule at the end of World War II.</TEXT></DOC>
