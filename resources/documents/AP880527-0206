The American Chamber of Commerce in South Africa said limitedU.S. sanctions imposed in 1986 carried little impact. Butlegislation now being considered by Congress ``would havefar-reaching negative effects on all companies operating in SouthAfrica and on the South African economy as a whole,'' groupofficials said.   The chamber, which represents interests of U.S. companies inSouth Africa, opposes sanctions. Five chamber members traveled toWashington in April and met with congressmen and aides to lobbyagainst additional sanctions.   ``The measures now being debated dwarf anything that's been doneso far,'' said Adriaan Botha, executive directer of the group.   Both houses of Congress are weighing sanctions designed toprotest South Africa's apartheid policies of racial segregation.The two similar bills would cut virtually all economic activitybetween the two countries.   The moves would include disinvestment by all U.S. companies,whose South African investments are estimated at $1.1 billion.   All trade would be banned, except for certain strategic mineralsthe United States buys from South Africa. U.S. imports from SouthAfrica in 1987 were about $1.3 billion and exports were also $1.3billion.   Botha said the South African government's February decisioneffectively banning 17 leading anti-apartheid organizations had putthe sanctions issue ``back on the boil'' in the United States.   The limited sanctions approved by Congress in 1986 overPresident Reagan's veto banned importation of certain goods andhalted direct air links between the two countries.   The chamber said South Africa has become ``complacent aboutfurther sanctions-disinvestment due to the fact that, in the shortterm, a large number of individuals and companies have benefited.''   Many American businesses that left South Africa sold profitableoperations to local businessmen at bargain prices. About 160American companies have departed in the past two years, while about155 remain.   A wide range of South Africans, including some blacks andanti-apartheid whites, oppose sanctions on the grounds that blacksare most likely to suffer any economic hardships that result.   Proponents of sanctions say economic pressure will speed up thegovernment's race reforms.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
