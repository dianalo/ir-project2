Rb-Sr dating of six samplesfrom different facies of Rio Maria Granodiorite furnished an age of 2564+- 68 Ma with initial /sup 87/Sr//sup 86/Sr radio (IR) of 0.70288 +-0.00092 (whole rock isochron; 1 {omicron} error; MSWD = 2.26). Thirteensamples from the three facies of Musa Granite (monzogranites, syenogranitesand intermediate to felsic hypabyssal rocks) gave Rb-Sr whole rock isochronwith an age of 1692 +- 11 Ma and IR of 0.70777 +- 0.00023 (1 {omicron}error, MSWD = 1.89). A preliminary attempt to individualize geochronologicallythe three facies was done resulting different ages and IRs. There isa coincidence between these ages and the emplacement sequence of thesefacies of the pluton. The actual meaning of the Rio Maria GranodioriteRb-Sr age is still uncertain. It could be related to the end of the magmaticcrystallization of the batholith as well as to the metamorphic-myloniticevent that affect it. Considering that the Jamon and Musa Granites arepetrologically similar that they occur in the same area, it is interestingto note that latter is apparently a little older than the former. TheIRs obtained for the two plutons are also not coincident. The isotopicRb-Sr available data show that the exposed rocks of the Rio Maria Granodioritehave not been able to generate magmas with the compositions of the monzongraniticand the hypabyssal facies of the Musa pluton. On the other hand, rocksisotopically similar to the Rio Maria Granodiorite would theoricallybe able to generate the Jamon and a magma with the characteristics ofthe syenogranitic facies of the Musa pluton.</TEXT></DOC>
