ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA says a nuclear-powered probe to belaunched from the space shuttle Atlantis next week does not pose athreat, and would have withstood the Challenger explosion withoutreleasing deadly plutonium.   ``This important mission can be undertaken safely,'' theNational Aeronautics and Space Administration said Friday in answerto a lawsuit seeking to stop the Oct. 12 launch.   The Florida Coalition for Peace and Justice and otherorganizations opposed to the launch are trying to spread a tale ofhorrors, but ``there is no evidence that these horrors will in factor are likely to occur,'' NASA told U.S. District Judge OliverGasch in a brief.   Gasch has scheduled oral arguments for Tuesday, two days beforeAtlantis is to lift off from Kennedy Space Center carrying intoorbit a probe called Galileo.   The probe has two 24.7-pound radioisotope thermoelectricgenerators, known as RTGs, that create electricity for the longjourney. They are similar to those that powered the Voyager probeas it swept past Neptune recently.   The Florida group claims danger of plutonium contamination froma shuttle disaster is far greater than the government has admitted.But NASA said engineers determined that ``if the Galileospacecraft, its RTGs, and its attached booster rocket had beenaboard the Challenger in 1986, no plutonium would have beenreleased as a result of the accident.''   NASA has spent $1.5 billion _ and expects to pay $400 millionmore _ on the project, which will culminate in six years when thecraft begins orbiting Jupiter.   ``In essence, plaintiffs do not like the launch decision and aretrying to get the court to second-guess the executive branch of thegovernment with regard to the acceptability of risk,'' said thebrief filed by Justice Department lawyer Stuart B. Schoenburg.   Opponents warned that the possibilities of an accident and adeadly plutonium release from Galileo are 1-in-350.   NASA countered that exhaustive environmental impact studiesshowed the most probable accident statistically would be failure ofthe rocket that will propel the probe after it is released from theshuttle cargo bay.   Even if the two thermonuclear power plants re-entered Earth'satmosphere, broke apart on hard rock and released plutonium, therewould be no additional cancer deaths over a 70-year period, NASAsaid.   Studies showed that even in this worst case, according to theagency, the an individual have only a 1-in-100 million chance ofbeing hurt.   The space probe's journey to Jupiter will be a complicated one,involving one slingshot orbit of Venus and two of Earth to gainmomentum. NASA said the highest potential for human harm would beif the craft crashed through the atmosphere when it makes its closeapproach to Earth. The chances of that happening are 5-in-10million, the brief said.   ``Under this maximum case scenario, there is a 1-in-10 millionprobability of 9.4 excess cancer fatalities worldwide over a70-year period,'' NASA said, and the average individual risk wouldbe 1-in-25 billion.   The space agency plans to begin the countdown Monday asscheduled.</TEXT></DOC>
