First National, closed yesterday by the federal Comptroller of the Currency, had assets of $21.5 million. First National's $19.9 million of deposits, held in 4,400 accounts, will be available beginning today at First Bank's office.    First Bank is unable to reopen First National's office because Kansas law doesn't allow banks to operate branches.    First National was the 53rd bank in the U.S. to fail this year, and the second in Kansas. </TEXT></DOC>
