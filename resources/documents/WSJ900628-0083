The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which investigatespossible fraud at all insolvent thrifts, said yesterday it'slaunching a special task force to examine whether Drexelcontributed to the failures and will pursue those losses inDrexel's bankruptcy case. The FDIC expects preliminaryfindings for these 350 thrifts in about one month, the agencysaid.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We want to make sure that as far as Drexel and Milkenrelationships go, the investigators accelerate that work andget their findings in to us,&quot; said Jack Smith, deputy generalcounsel of the FDIC.   Two things prompted the FDIC to step up its Drexelinvestigation beyond several large institutions. For one,forming the task force indirectly acknowledges that morethrifts have ties to Drexel -- through purchases ofhigh-risk, high-yield &quot;junk&quot; bonds and loans to the firm --than was previously thought. Also, the bankruptcy courtrecently imposed a Nov. 15 deadline for creditor claims, theagency said.   Mr. Smith won't say how much Drexel contributed to thriftlosses, except to say, &quot;It's in the millions of dollars.&quot;Failed Sandamp;Ls hold a total of about $4 billion to $6 billion injunk bonds.   The Securities and Exchange Commission says it is Drexel'slargest unsecured creditor because of the $150 million thatDrexel has pledged to it under a consent decree to compensatecivil claimants who seek recourse for losses. Yesterday, FDICGeneral Counsel Alfred Byrne said in a statement: &quot;In fact,we believe that the FDIC and the (Resolution Trust Corp.) maybe among the largest creditors in the Drexel bankruptcies.Through this new task force, and through other measures, weintend to recover the maximum amount possible for ourinsurance funds and ultimately, for the American taxpayer.&quot;   The FDIC's bankruptcy probe is running a parallel courseto several other pending federal Drexel investigations by theJustice Department and the SEC. Several large, insolventthrifts, including Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association ofIrvine, Calif.; CenTrust Savings of Miami, and ColumbiaSavings of Beverly Hill, Calif., were big customers ofDrexel. Many of these thrifts, it is alleged, swapped thejunk bonds and booked artificial profits on the sales.   &quot;We will keep a sharp eye out for daisy-chain operations,&quot;Mr. Smith said.   Federal investigators will also be looking at whetherCenTrust was able to raise capital through Drexel in exchangefor buying millions of dollars of Drexel-issued junk bonds.   &quot;There are other institutions that had relations withDrexel,&quot; Mr. Smith of the FDIC said. &quot;The question is whetheryou find losses associated with that. That's what we arelooking into.&quot;   Mr. Milken earlier this year pleaded guilty to six felonycounts of securities fraud, and agreed to pay $600 million infines and restitution. He is expected to be sentenced inOctober. Mr. Milken hasn't cooperated with the investigationso far, but is expected to do so after sentencing. Onegovernment official said yesterday that at that point,government investigators expect him to cooperate with thebankruptcy investigation as well.   The task force will include about a dozen attorneys inWashington, and dozens more in the field, Mr. Smith said.</TEXT></DOC>
