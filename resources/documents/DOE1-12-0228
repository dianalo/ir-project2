The dependence of this phenomenonon the concentration of the promutagens and G-SH, the time of preincubationof the bacteria with the investigated substance and with the activatingmixture, as well as on the concentration of microsomal protein, was studied.The replacement of G-SH by cysteine in an equimolar concentration hadno influence on the mutagenic effect of NM, DENA, and CP, which is evidenceof an enzymatic mechanism of the detoxification of mutagenic metabolitesof the investigated substances.</TEXT></DOC>
