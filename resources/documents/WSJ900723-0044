Nine states now take account of the environment &quot;in oneway or another&quot; when planning to meet power needs, saysRichard Ottinger, a professor at Pace University, WhitePlains, N.Y., who led a recent study on the subject. Two ofthe states, New York and Wisconsin, now require bids on newpower generators to include projected environmental costs --a &quot;major breakthrough,&quot; says Mr. Ottinger.   Projected costs of new coal-fired generators in New Yorkmust include about 1.4 cents a kilowatt-hour to account forair pollution and other environmental impacts. (New Yorkresidents now pay, on average, a total of about seven cents akilowatt-hour.) The add-on is lower than recent estimates offuture pollution costs, says Nicholas Lenssen, a researcherat the Worldwatch Institute, a Washington-based group thatstudies environmental issues. But it helps put solar, windand other &quot;renewable energy on a level playing field&quot; withconventional alternatives, he says.   The California Energy Commission is considering a similarrule, but the environmental costs it's considering &quot;wouldn'tbe sufficient to make renewable energy {projects byutilities} cost-effective vs. low-emitting natural gas&quot;generators, says William Pennington, a research manager atthe commission.   But to diversify California's energy base, the commissionmay require utilities to devote a portion of new-capacityoutlays to renewable energy, he adds.                                                                                                          Recycling Drive Faces   Another Go-Around                                                                                                          AN INITIATIVE on recycling in Massachusetts drew 120,000petition signers but was derailed for lack of a singlesignature.   The initiative, a potential landmark law watched closelyby environmental and industry groups nationwide, would haverequired all packaging sold in the state to be reusable,recyclable or made partly of recycled material by 1996.Proponents argued that it would help build markets forrecycled goods and cut wasteful packaging. Industryopponents, countering that it would be onerous for them anddo little to cut garbage, mounted legal challenges to blockit.   A drive by the initiative's backers, which includedvarious state officials, had collected about 120,000signatures to put the proposed law on the November ballot,says Amy Perry of the Massachusetts Public Interest ResearchGroup, the initiative's main sponsor. But in a lawsuitbrought by the industry opponents, the Massachusetts SupremeJudicial Court ruled this month that the originating petitionfor the initiative was invalid.   State law required it to have 10 valid signatures. Thecourt ruled that because one of its 10 signers hadn't seenthe final draft of the initiative -- it was described to herover the phone -- the petition didn't count. Now it's toolate to resubmit for this fall. Environmentalists are tryingto overturn the ruling, but for now the initiative appears tobe quashed.                                                                                                          Trash Crisis Collides   With Health-Care Crunch                                                                                                          SOARING COSTS for health care may face further upwardpressure from a hospital trash crisis.   After medical wastes turned up on beaches in recent years,state and federal laws were enacted requiring hospitals totrack trash more carefully. The laws also classify morehospital trash as infectious material, which is treated&quot;almost like nuclear waste,&quot; says Jim Karpiak, ahealth-policy analyst with the American Hospital Association.Some hospitals pulverize infectious waste, then soak it inchlorine before sending it to special incinerators orlandfills.   Of 6,700 tons of trash produced daily by U.S. hospitals,about 15% is classified as infectious, says William Rutala, aUniversity of North Carolina specialist on medical waste. Buthospitals in four Eastern states participating in a pilotprogram of new federal medical-waste rules typically classify30% or more of their trash as infectious, he adds. ForYale-New Haven Hospital in New Haven, Conn., the annual trashbill has tripled to almost $1 million under the new rules,says Norman Roth, a hospital official.   Such bills threaten funding crunches at many hospitals,which are trying harder to cut trash. Emerson Hospital, inConcord, Mass., switched this month to cloth from disposablediapers. The change won't mean much saving on its trash bill,but it represents the first step in a broad program to &quot;startdecreasing waste, because it won't be affordable if wedon't,&quot; says Coco Richmond, Emerson's materials manager.   Clarifying Impurities   In Bottled Water                                                                                                          SOME KINDS of bottled water in Vermont may soon dry upbecause of a new labeling law there.   The law, effective this month, requires sellers of bottledwater in the state to disclose on their labels the levels offour common contaminants: sodium, lead, arsenic and nitrates.Thought to be the first of its kind, the law was sponsored byState Rep. Andrew Christiansen of East Montpelier, who sayshe grew worried because of high levels of nitrates found insome awful-tasting bottled water he bought.   One of the state's largest sellers of bottled water,Perrier Group of America, which markets Poland Spring bottledwater, says it probably will drop some bottled-water productsin Vermont to avoid the costs of new labels.   Meanwhile, Mr. Christiansen now gets his water from anearby well that tested low in nitrates.</TEXT></DOC>
