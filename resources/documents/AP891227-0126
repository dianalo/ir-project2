(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Lorimar Studios changed the nameof its Robert Taylor Building after tenants complained in apetition that the late actor testified before Congress againstHollywood figures.   The petitioners wanted Taylor's name banished because hetestified before the old House Un-American Activities Committeeagainst the so-called Hollywood 10, writers alleged to haveassociated with communist organizations during the 1930s, '40s or'50s.   Taylor also was considered a supporter of the Hollywoodblacklist that kept those writers from working under their ownnames.   Arnold Shupack, senior vice president and general manager ofLorimar, approved the name change on Nov. 15, his office saidWednesday.   Shupack changed the name of the building, containing mostlyoffices of people connected to the industry, to the George CukorBuilding. Cukor directed most of his films on the movie lot thatLorimar took over from MGM.   Before MGM sold the lot, the 74-year-old building was called theLion Building. Lorimar changed the names of the lot's old buildingsto honor former movie stars.   Taylor died of lung cancer in June 1969.</TEXT></DOC>
