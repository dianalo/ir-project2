Traders said the deficit talks between the White House and congressional leaders have moved to the top of a list of issues affecting the foreign exchange market. All those factors currently are negative for the dollar, they said.    Others include the expected size of the September U.S. trade deficit, which will be announced Thursday, and last week's White House statement that the administration will seek to hold down interest rates to support the economy even if it means a lower dollar.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 134.15 Japanese yen, a 40-year low, down 0.7% from 135.03 late Friday. The dollar also fell to 1.6595 West German marks from 1.6704. Earlier yesterday, the dollar traded at a record low of 1.6560 marks.    The Bank of Japan reportedly bought a small amount of dollars at the start of Tokyo trading Tuesday, and the U.S. currency turned slightly firmer after touching still another record low.    Tokyo currency market sources said the central bank stepped in minutes after the dollar opened at 134.25 yen. The dollar subsequently fell to 134.10 yen, then quickly rebounded to around 134.25.    The sources weren't sure about the size of the reported intervention, but they described it as small. The Bank of Japan, as is its practice, had no comment.    In Basel, Switzerland, meanwhile, central bankers from the world's leading industrial nations also expressed concern about the budget talks in Washington. Officials attending the regular monthly meeting of central bankers at the Bank for International Settlements said they are looking to the White House and Congress to reach a credible agreement to lower the budget deficit by the Nov. 20 deadline set by the Gramm-Rudman law.    Robert Hatcher, vice president, foreign exchange, for Barclays Bank PLC in New York, said, &quot;The budget situation is of foremost importance to the market, with the trade deficit a close No. 2. The budget negotiations are on everyone's lips.&quot;    To relieve downward pressure on the dollar, traders said, negotiators would have to agree to trim the fiscal 1988 budget deficit by more than the $23 billion required by the Gramm-Rudman law.    &quot;If we get nothing more than the Gramm-Rudman cuts, then the dollar will go substantially lower,&quot; Elizabeth Monaghan, a trader at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said. The budget negotiators &quot;hold the future of the dollar in their hands,&quot; she said.    In Washington yesterday, White House and congressional budget negotiators again made little progress in seeking a deficit-reduction accord.    &quot;None of the main issues have been resolved,&quot; a congressional official said. &quot;They're still dancing around.&quot;    A statement issued by the central bankers meeting in Basel, meanwhile, provided no support for the dollar, as the bank governors suggested that changes in fiscal policies precede any changes in monetary policy. Officials at the meeting said the bankers also hoped to encourage West Germany to consider bringing forward tax cuts planned for 1990.    The governors' statement called on major nations to adopt fiscal policies aimed at reducing payments imbalances, promoting exchange-rate stability and sustaining non-inflationary growth. It said the governors &quot;are ready to support these objectives with appropriate monetary policies.&quot;    The statement, which was badly received in the financial markets, failed to make any mention of February's Louvre accord, the currency stabilization agreement signed by seven leading industrial nations. Although the countries still formally subscribe to the accord, it has appeared practically defunct recently, in light of the dollar's slide and the U.S. policy statement last week that put lower interest rates ahead of defending the dollar.    Along with the international concern over the budget negotiations, Thursday's Commerce Department report on merchandise trade is also overhanging the dollar. The report is generally expected to show that the U.S. trade deficit contracted to $14.7 billion in September from $15.7 billion in August. But an improvement of that size wouldn't do much to change the negative market sentiment on the dollar.    &quot;It would take a very good trade figure to break the back of the bearish trend, and it's difficult to visualize something like that happening,&quot; Mr. Hatcher of Barclays said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.20 an ounce to $461.90 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $462.75 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---   Peter Norman contributed to this article.    ---                     Late New York Trading                      Monday, Nov. 9, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
