One worker developeda severe asthma attack following initial exposure to the resin, Du-PontFASLOC, and was diagnosed by two pulmonary medicine specialists as havingoccupationally induced asthma. Sensitization to the resin or its componentswas not tested. Three other workers reported headaches, sore throats,and coughs following exposure. All four were interviewed, and medicalhistories were requested but only one was obtained. Air samples weretaken near machine operators' breathing zones and downwind of vaporsduring roof bolting. These were analyzed for resin components, styrene,vinyl-toluene, or butyl benzyl phthalate. There were no detectable levelsof the latter two chemicals, and styrene was present near the detectionlimit of 0.05 parts per million. The authors conclude that there is nohealth risk to the general work force from this resin. However, if atrue hypersensitivity does exist in the asthmatic individual, furtherresin exposure would be harmful to the worker.</TEXT></DOC>
