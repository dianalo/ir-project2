Theinvisible substance often is strongly present in some mines and can collect inunventilated homes.;     Threat to cells;    Radon decays into a group ofshort-lived radioisotopes that can attach themselves to dust particles andthen be inhaled. Two of the radioisotopes, polonium-218 and polonium-214, emitalpha radiation that can damage cells and cause lung cancer.;    High levelsof lung cancer among some miners is attributed to their daily contact withradon, and some earlier studies found that the risk was as great or greaterfor residents in homes where radon was concentrated.;    But the new NRC studysaid that when comparing how the radon particles would be inhaled andabsorbed, the risk of cancer &quot;tends to be lower for the home environment -- byabout 30 percent for adults of both sexes and by 20 percent or less forinfants and children.&quot;;     Comparing homes, mines;    As a result, the studysaid, direct comparisons of the risk in homes and mines may overestimate thelung-cancer danger at home.;    Dust particles in homes tend to be smallerthan in mines, the study said. This increases the likelihood that homeparticles, including those attached to radon, would be deposited in the lung.;   However, the committee said, miners tend to breathe more rapidly, becauseof the exertion of heavy work, so they are inhaling a greater amount ofradon.;    Children in homes tend to be more susceptible to radon-causeddisease than adults because they breathe more rapidly and are more apt to bephysically active. But children at home still are less at risk of lung cancerthan are miners, the study said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910202  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  402  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday February 2, 199100033005,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
