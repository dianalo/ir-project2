The Federal Home Loan Bank Board said net withdrawals from the3,088 savings institutions were $123 million in July after hittinga revised $3.3 billion in June, up from a previous estimate of $2.9billion.   In May, Sandamp;L customers withdrew $1.1 billion. But, before thatdeposits grew for seven consecutive months as investors battered bythe October stock market crash sought a safe haven for their moneyin government-insured accounts.   Bank Board economist James Barth said in a statement that aslowdown in withdrawals is normal for July. Consumers typicallytake money from their accounts at the start of summer to pay forvacations and other seasonal expenses.   Mortgage lending by thrift institutions in July declined to$21.1 billion, 14 percent below the same month last year when manypeople were refinancing their mortgages, the bank board said.   Barth said the drop in mortgage lending reflects the climb ininterest rates this summer.   The bank board also reported that the institutions' capitaldeclined by $573 million in July after falling by $3.0 billion inJune. For the first seven months of the year, it's off $6.4 billion.   Declines in capital, which is the difference between aninstitution's loans and other assets and what it owes to depositorsand other creditors, often reflect losses.</TEXT></DOC>
