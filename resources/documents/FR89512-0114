Box 1233,Charleston, West Virginia 25324 has filed a petition to modify the applicationof 30 CFR 75.326 (aircourses and belt haulage entries) to its Federal No.2 Mine (I.D. No. 46-01456) located in Monongalia County, West Virginia.The petition is filed under Section 101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety andHealth Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that intake and return aircoursesbe separated from belt haulage entries and that belt haulage entries notbe used to ventilate active working places.2. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to use belt haulage airin the active working faces of both of the two 4-North Mains developmentsections, all longwall development sections, and on active longwall facesin order to maximize the efficiency of the ventilation system in the 4-NorthMains area.3. In support of this request, petitioner proposes to install an earlywarning fire detection system utilizing a low-level carbon monoxide (CO)detection system in all belt entries used as intake aircourses and at eachbelt drive and tailpiece located in intake aircourses. The monitoring deviceswould be capable of giving warning of a fire for a minimum of four hoursafter the source of power to the belt is removed; a visual alert signalwould be activated when the CO level is 10 parts per million (ppm) aboveambient air and an audible signal would sound at 15 ppm above ambient air.All persons would be withdrawn to a safe area at 10 ppm and evacuated at15 ppm. The fire alarm signal would be activated at an attended surfacelocation where there is two-way communication. The CO system would be capableof identifying any activated sensor, monitoring electrical continuity anddetecting electrical malfunctions.4. The CO system would be visually examined at least once during each coal-producingshift and tested weekly to ensure the monitoring system is functioningproperly. The monitoring system would be calibrated with known concentrationsof CO and air mixtures at least monthly.5. If the CO system is deenergized for routine maintenance or for failureof a sensor unit, the belt conveyor would continue to operate and qualifiedpersons would patrol and monitor the belt conveyor using hand-held CO detectingdevices.6. The details for the fire detection system would be included as partof the ventilation system, methane and dust control plan.7. The concentrations of respirable dust in the intake air in the beltconveyor entries used as intake aircourses would comply with the requirementsof 30 CFR 70.100(b). Respirable dust samples would be taken in all beltentries used as intake aircourses and the location of the sampling areaswould be included as designated areas in the ventilation system and methaneand dust control plan.8. The permanent stopping separating the conveyor belt entries from theintake escapeway would be specifically approved in the ventilation systemand methane and dust control plan for the mine.9. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
