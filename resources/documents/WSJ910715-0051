In its annual salary survey, the business researchorganization said salaried workers should average 5% payincreases this year and next. That will mean a &quot;real earningsgain for employees, since the rise in inflation is currentlyprojected at 4.7% in 1991 and 3.8% in 1992,&quot; said ElizabethArreglado, the Conference Board's compensation specialist.</LP><TEXT>   The insurance industry is expected to show the largestaverage 1991 salary boost, about 5.5%. All other categoriesin the survey -- commercial banking, diversified services,manufacturing, trade and utilities -- will offer about 5%raises.   Of the 537 companies surveyed, 406, or 76%, currentlyoffer at least one type of variable pay program. Most popularare special awards to employees for individual contributions,used by 43% of companies. Profit-sharing (34%),pay-for-performance target awards (34%), and lump-sum meritpay not added to base salary (26%) also were popular.&quot;Variable pay, which had traditionally been granted toexecutives and sales personnel, is now becoming available toother employees,&quot; Ms. Arreglado said. Its prevalence mayindicate &quot;the greater autonomy of business units within acompany to install programs that reward and motivateemployees.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
