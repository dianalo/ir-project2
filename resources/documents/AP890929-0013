A high-profile Democratic effort to derail the tax break, whichparty leaders called a giveaway to the rich, was beaten 239-190 onThursday. The Democratic alternative contained a tax increase onthe wealthy, and 64 Democrats defected to the president's side.   Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, saidBush's House victory ``wasn't unexpected'' but that he would try tobuck Bush with an alternative of his own when his committee meetsnext week.   Bentsen, a longtime supporter of special tax treatment forcapital gains earnings, says the nation can't afford to give awaytoo many new tax breaks with federal deficits running at $130billion a year.   However, others in the Senate were certain to push for thecapital gains cut.   The Bentsen plan would restore universally deductible IndividualRetirement Accounts, an idea the House Democrats' proposal alsoembraced. But his plan doesn't include their proposal to raiseincome taxes on the wealthy, who now pay a lower marginal rate thanthe upper middle class.   Setting a lower tax rate for capital gains, which Bush promisedin his presidential campaign, would reverse what was considered amajor achievement of the 1986 tax overhaul supported by PresidentReagan _ taxing earned and unearned income at the same rate.   The Bush plan approved Thursday as part of a huge, 2,000-pagebudget bill would reduce the maximum tax rate on capital gains from33 percent to 19.6 percent for the next 27 months. After that, therate would rise to 28 percent, but taxes would not be paid onearnings attributable to inflation.   ``A lower capital gains rate will reduce the cost of capital andcreate incentives for investment in the long-term productivecapacity of American industry,'' Bush said in hailing Thursday'svote.   Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., called the plan ``a$25,000-a-year tax cut on average to 375,000 American families _the wealthiest families in America _ for some decision they alreadymade'' and not for new investment.   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said the Democrats tookthe correct position even though they lost and he would continuethe fight.   ``This is not the end of the process. It is the beginning,'' hesaid.   In the House, the capital gains fight was just one of many inthe bill, which will continue to occupy the chamber most of nextweek. Other, less partisan battles are expected then on whether torepeal the Medicare catastrophic illness insurance plan, and on newfederal support for child care.   Regardless of the eventual fate of the bill, the politicalimplications of the vote will linger.   John Buckley, spokesman for the House GOP's campaignorganization, said his telephone facsimile machines were hummingwith press releases tagging any Democrats who supported their partyas voting for a tax increase and against jobs and prosperity.   ``This is one of those votes that you lie awake waiting for, andwe got it,'' he said, adding that it would be brought up again forthe 1990 elections.   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said Democrats also gained issues _the IRA, the federal deficit and the economy.   ``Both parties right now are plowing, fertilizing and seedingthe fields'' for next year, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
