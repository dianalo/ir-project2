The restaurant and bar were empty at the time and no one washurt, but Inspector Don Bond of Avon and Somerset police said theexplosion at the university in western England caused considerabledamage.   Animal rights militants have mounted an increasingly violentcampaign in Britain in recent years, and there have been pastthreats of violence to the university in the port city of Bristol110 miles west of London.   The university's medical school carries out experiments onanimals, but the university insists the experiments cause nosuffering to the animals involved.   ``As yet, we don't know what the cause of the explosion was,''Bond said.   The British Broadcasting Corp and the British domestic newsagency Press Association both reported the explosion was proablycaused by a bomb planted by animal rights militants.   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but the London-basedDaily Mirror, one of Britain's national-circulation tabloids,reported receiving a telephone call Wednesday saying a bomb wasplanted in the university building. The anonymous caller said he wasfrom a group called the Animal Abused Society and that the bombwould go off at noon Wednesday.   Police searched the university building Wednesday morning butfound nothing. The bomb exploded shortly after midnight.   The restaurant and bar were on the fifth floor of Senate House,the university's six-story administration block.   In addition to destroying the restaurant and bar, the explosioncaused extensive damage to rooms in the block, blew out windows overa wide area and caused considerable structural damage to the floorimmediately above and the floor immediately below, police said. Theentire block was empty at the time.   Don Carleton, a spokesman at the university, said theuniversity's computer which is housed in the block may have beenbadly damaged. The computer stores everything from research notes todetails of day-to-day operations.   Bristol University, which was founded in 1909, is a leadingBritish university with 7,300 students studying subjects rangingacross the academic spectrum from sciences to languages, literatureand other liberal arts.</TEXT></DOC>
