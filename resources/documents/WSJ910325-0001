It's an ever-so-slight softening, and an enormous gapremains between the Japanese and Soviet positions. Still, thechange has Tokyo abuzz with talk of a deal that would giveJapan sovereignty over four disputed islands in return forextending aid to the struggling Soviet economy.Traditionally, the Japanese government has insisted that theSoviet Union return all four islands simultaneously and hassaid it won't talk about extending credits or loan guaranteesto Soviet development projects until the islands issue isresolved. Now top political leaders are beginning to say thatall four islands don't have to be returned simultaneously -Japan would take two now and two later as long as the Soviets&quot;recognized&quot; Japan's sovereignty over all four now.</LP><TEXT>   Japanese officials insist they aren't making concessionsor changing their fundamental position. They paint thesoftening as a mere recognition of the difficult logisiticsof transferring territory. &quot;Since as many as 20,000 Russianslive there {on two of the islands}, there is a question ofwhat these people will do,&quot; Ichiro Ozawa, secretary-generalof the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, said in an interview.&quot;It will take them time to seek new jobs and build newhouses. We understand that it will take some time. And thatis all right.&quot;   Today, Mr. Ozawa begins two days of talks with Mr.Gorbachev in Moscow to prepare for the Soviet leader'sscheduled visit to Japan next month. Besides being willing toaccept a delayed return of two of the islands, Mr. Ozawa alsohints he will show a slightly more positive attitude oneconomic cooperation.   &quot;Japan has always said that the Soviets should be the oneto make the first move. `You've done something bad so youshould solve this issue first.' But that doesn't solve theproblem,&quot; Mr. Ozawa said. &quot;That's why I'm saying we shouldsincerely talk with each other. In that sense, this is a bitdifferent from what the government has been doing. We willalso become a little {more} flexible is what we're saying.&quot;   Although Mr. Ozawa dodges specifics on the economic aidquestion, the Japanese press abounds with speculativearticles putting huge price tags on the islands. Japan'slargest-circulation daily, the Yomiuri Shimbun, recentlyquoted unidentified Soviet officials as saying Japan wasoffering $28 billion in credits and loans for various Sovietprojects, from car factories to petrochemical plants. NihonKeizai Shimbun, Japan's leading financial daily, said Japanis considering extending as much as $7 billion over 10 yearsin development assistance.   An islands-for-aid deal would have major implications forthe Soviet economy and for the security of East Asia. But theJapanese press reports are all premised on the assumptionthat the Soviets are prepared to give Japan from two to fourislands. With conservatives gaining increasing power inMoscow, the assumption that Mr. Gorbachev is prepared to giveany islands is at least open to question.   &quot;You may think, `If he can give up Eastern Europe, whyshould he have so many qualms about these four islands, whichnever had the strategic significance of Czechoslovakia.' Butit's not that easy,&quot; said Angela Stent, an expert on theSoviet Union at Georgetown University. Speaking to a group offoreign reporters in Tokyo, Ms. Stent noted: &quot;It's aparticularly difficult time to give up two islands.&quot;   The islands, north of Hokkaido, make up what Japan refersto as its Northern Territories and what the Soviets considerpart of the Kuril Islands. The traditional Soviet positionhas been that various agreements and treaties gave it theright to seize the islands at gunpoint in 1945, and thereforethere is no &quot;territorial&quot; question to discuss. Over the lastcouple of years Soviet diplomats have relented to the extentof being willing to elaborate, in a series of working-levelmeetings, on why the islands are rightfully the SovietUnion's. But the Soviet government has otherwise refused togive ground, even though Soviet academics and the Sovietmedia have floated islands-for-aid proposals.   Last week, the independent Interfax news agency in Moscowsaid the Soviet Union would revive a 1956 pledge to returnthe two islands closest to Japan, Shikotan and the Habomais.That offer was part of a Japanese-Soviet joint statement thatwas supposed to lead to a peace treaty officially endingWorld War II between the two countries. The peace treaty andthe islands offer eventually fell through as relationsworsened between the Soviet Union and Japan's major ally, theU.S., in the late 1950s.   Japanese officials take a wait-and-see attitude towardsthe Interfax and other Soviet media reports. &quot;There's no oneelse than Gorbachev who can make decisions there, so I won'tknow until I actually talk with him,&quot; Mr. Ozawa said in theinterview Friday.   While a return to the 1956 formulation would be a sign ofprogress, it probably wouldn't be enough to satisfy Japan.Senior Japanese diplomats have repeatedly stressed thatJapan's bargaining position has improved since 1956. Afterwaiting four decades, they expect more from Mr. Gorbachevthan they were offered then.   But with the first visit to Japan by a Soviet ruler fastapproaching, both sides are also aware that there may neverbe another opportunity as favorable for cutting a deal. &quot;Ithink that now is the biggest chance for Japan and the SovietUnion,&quot; said Mr. Ozawa. &quot;If we let this chance go, the tiesof both countries will recede once more.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
