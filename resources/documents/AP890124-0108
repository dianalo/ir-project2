A State Department official who has seen the correspondence fromSheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah said, ``The letters themselves areunusual, but the content is not.'' The official refused to be quotedby name.   Fadlallah, 53, is the spiritual guru of Hezbollah, an umbrellagroup of pro-Iranian Moslem Shiites. Elements within the Lebanesegroup actively employ terrorism and are thought to control theAmerican hostages, U.S. officials say.   Fadlallah's written statements, in Arabic, came in response toletters sent to him by Peggy Say, the sister of hostage TerryAnderson; the Journalists Committee to Free Terry Anderson; the NewYork-based Committee to Protect Journalists, and Ray Barnett, thehead of Friends in the West and Ambassadors of Aid, two humanitariangroups in Seattle, Wash.   Anderson, an Associated Press correspondent in Beirut when he waskidnapped in March 1985, has been held longer than any of the otherAmerican hostages.   On Tuesday, the wives of three American professors at BeirutUniversity College, seized two years ago, appealed for the releaseof their husbands as they began their third year in captivity. Thethree men are Alann Steen of Boston, Robert Polhill of New York andJesse Turner of Boise, Idaho.   The responses Fadlallah gave to the letter-writers were similarin tone and content, but were not identical.   ``We are always sorry for the continuous human suffering which wehave tried to solve and continue to try to solve to bring thesituation to a happy ending,'' Fadlallah wrote Mrs. Say, who livesin Cadiz, Ky.   To Anne Nelson, executive director of the Committee to ProtectJournalists, Fadlallah said, ``I have tried several times tointervene to find a solution of their situation but my effortsfailed because they were complicated by factors at the internationallevel.''   The Moslem leader told William Foley, a Time magazinephotographer in New York who works with the committee to freeAnderson, that ``we emphasize our concern to maintain friendlyrelations with the American people. ...''   Fadlallah disavowed any responsibility for the kidnappings.   Mrs. Say, who has written Fadlallah in the past but never beforereceived a response, said she interpreted the letter as meaning theShiite leader might be willing to be a ``point of contact'' in anynegotiations to free the hostages. She pointed out that Fadlallahknows Anderson, who had interviewed him as a reporter.   The letters, delivered through an intermediary, were receivedlast week.   The U.S. official said that Fadlallah has made manypronouncements about the hostages, some of which have appeared to becontradictory. Moreover, he said that officials are ``not quite surehow much influence (Fadlallah) has personally'' over the kidnappers.   The United States has a policy of not negotiating with thoseholding hostages, although officials will talk about the welfare ofthe captives.   ``There is no direct contact between us and the Iranians andbetween us and Fadlallah,'' the official said.   In a newspaper interview published in October, Fadlallah wasquoted as saying the fate of the hostages ``would have to wait forthe outcome of the American presidential election.'' He said thenthat Iran preferred to deal with Republicans.   President Bush has said he foresees the day of better relationswith Iran, which could lead to the release of the hostages. ``Idon't start off with the view that we always have to be atloggerheads,'' he said recently.   Still, Bush has said he thinks it would be wrong to assume thatIran ``controls a key to all these hostages.''   Iran's prime minister, Hussein Musavi, said last week the hostageissue was an ``internal question of Lebanon,'' and what his countrycan do is limited because ``it is a question of territory.''   The other hostages are Thomas Sutherland, a dean at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut; Joseph James Cicippio, acting comptroller ofthe university; Frank Herbert Reed, director of the LebanonInternational School in Beirut; Edward Austin Tracy, an author, andMarine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, head of an observer groupattached to the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
