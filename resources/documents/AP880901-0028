(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan says he'll goalong with Congress and grant most federal workers a 4.1 percentpay increase next year, more than double the amount he had sought.   Reagan, in a letter to congressional leaders Wednesday, saidimproving economic conditions made possible the 4.1 percentincrease, although it earlier had appeared the government would beable to afford only 2 percent.   The raise, contained in a bill already passed by Congress butwhich has not yet reached Reagan's desk, will go to federal workersnow earning between $10,000 and $75,500 per year, and will takeeffect in their first pay period of the new calendar year.   Reagan expressed regret that a House-Senate conference committeeon appropriations did not extend the pay raises to higher-paidfederal employees, since they are the ones who lag most seriouslybehind private-sector pay.   He said he would recommend increases for them in the finalbudget message that he will send to Congress before leaving officeon Jan. 20.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, with the vacationingpresident in California, said he did not know how much the payincreases would cost or how many employees would be covered.   Reagan noted the Advisory Committee on Federal Pay had told himthat increases in pay averaging 26.28 percent, effective inOctober, would be necessary to make federal pay comparable withthat in private employment.   Fitzwater said this calculation did not take account of employeebenefits, which often are higher for government workers than forthose in private industry.   ``We had earlier assumed, for budget plannning purposes, thateconomic conditions would only permit a 2 percent pay increase thisyear,'' Reagan wrote leaders of the House and Senate.   ``However, as the revitalization of the nation's economy hascontinued on the course this administratiofn has set, we have seenunemployment drop, and free market forces have resulted in risingpay rates for American workers, particularly in shortageoccupations. The federal government, as an employer, must competelike any other employer in the labor market for the skilled workersit needs.''   The president said it was clear that economic conditions wouldnot permit a pay increase of 26.28 percent, but would permit thesmaller increase ``to ensure the continued quality of our nation'scivil service.''   The president is required to make the pay determination annuallyunder a federal law passed in 1970.</TEXT></DOC>
