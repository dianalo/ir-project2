The calls in the pro-government newspapers followed SaudiArabia's rupture of its diplomatic ties with Iran on Tuesday. TheSaudis said they ended relations because of Iran's ``terrorism andsubversion.''   The Saudi statement referred to riots by Iranian pilgrims atMecca last year during the Haj, the annual pilgrimage to Islam'sholiest shrines. More than 400 people died in the violence July 31.After the riots, Iranians attacked the Saudi Embassy in Iran andIranian Revolutionary Guards conducted strikes on commercialshipping in the Persian Gulf region.   Urging all Moslem states to follow the Saudi example and severtheir ties with Tehran, the newspaper Al-Yawm said the Islamicconference ``should also expel Iran and turn over its seat to theIranian opposition.''   Former Iranian leaders Shahpour Bakhtiar and Abolhassan BaniSadr, who are living in exile, were among the first to expresssupport for the Saudi diplomatic break with Tehran.   The paper noted that the last ministerial conference of theIslamic organization, held in March in Jordan, had backed the Saudicondemnation of the Iranian action at Mecca and its determinationto accept only 45,000 Iranian pilgrims at the upcoming Haj ascompared to 150,000 last year.   The Saudis have asked all Islamic countries to reduce thenumbers of pilgrams because of ongoing renovations at Mecca. TheIranians have refused.   ``When the Iranian government refuses to abide by the decisionto limit the numbers of pilgrims, this means it rejects Islamicunanimity and breaks off from Islamic ranks,'' the paper wrote. Italso accused Iran of being a ``source of terrorism to allthroughout the world.''   Iran accuses the Saudis of aiding Iraq, its enemy in the7{-year-old gulf war. The Iranians regularly attack neutral ships,including Saudi vessels, in retaliation for Iraqi air raids on itstankers.   Iran frequently calls for the overthrow of the Saudi government.   On Thursday, Tehran radio quoted the Martyrs' Foundation, whichhelps the families of slain soldiers, as saying: ``It will not belong before the sacred shrines will be free from the blood-drippingclaws of the corrupt and dependent sheiks.''   The Martyrs' Foundation said the decision to limit the number ofpilgrims to Mecca was ``grossly impudent and contrary to theKoran,'' Islam's holy book.   In Kuwait, the country closest to the Iraq-Iran war and a targetof systematic acts of sabotage by pro-Iranian elements as well asIranian missile strikes, the newspaper Al-Anbaa said the governmentand other Arab states should follow the Saudi example.   Iran has also been accused of collusion in the recent hijackingof a Kuwait Airways jetliner. The hijackers, who killed twohostages, had demanded the release of 17 pro-Iranian terroristsjailed in Kuwait.   ``As we praise Saudi Arabia's firm and correct decision, wedemand that this decision be turned into a pan-Gulf and evenpan-Arab one because Iran has opted for being an enemy of the Arabsand it does not conceal its enmity, threats and ambitions butdeclare them in a flagrant manner,'' Al-Anbaa wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
