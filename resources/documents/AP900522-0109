The proposal, approved 4-0 by the NTSB, does not deal with whowill provide the seats or whether children will pay fares. But ifsuch a regulation takes effect, airlines are expected to requirethat parents generally lug along an infant seat _ like the onesrequired in cars _ and buy a ticket if they want to be guaranteedpassage for the child.   When planes aren't full, the airlines are expected to continueto allow infants to fly at no charge.   The recommendation now goes to the Federal AviationAdministration which has resisted a mandatory rule on the groundsthat the 5,000 to 10,000 youngsters under 2 years old who fly inadults' laps each day are not at great risk. The FAA is notrequired to follow NTSB recommendations and sometimes doesn't.   Under the NTSB proposal, parents who arrive at the gate of afully booked flight with an unticketed baby would not be allowed totake the child aboard. They also could be denied passage with anysmall child, with or without ticket, if they are not carrying anapproved car seat.   The FAA has said it will consider mandatory restraints but hasproposed only to require that airlines allow seats on board ifpassengers chose to use them _ a practice now followed by mostairlines.   The airline industry, flight attendants union, consumer safetygroups and some members of Congress all have called for mandatoryrestraints.   Some travel agents are among opponents of the measure who say itwould add to the cost of flying for young families and possiblyforce them to travel by automobile on shorter routes. They sayautomobile travel poses greater risks per mile than flying.   A Harvard Medical School statistical study in the early 1980stheorized that three infants might be saved over five years if allchildren used safety seats on airliners.   But two recent crashes in which unrestrained infants were killedhave led to more support for mandatory restraints. Two of the fiveunsecured children aboard United Flight 232 that crashed in Iowalast July died, and at least one unseated child was killed aboardthe Avianca airliner that crashed in New York in January.   The NTSB proposal would prevent children under 40 inches or 40pounds from flying without car seats approved for airliner use.   The safety board proposal, in keying on size and weight of thechild rather than age, also could lead to required seats for smallchildren older than 2 who now are allowed to use ordinary seatbelts, said board senior investigator Nora Marshall.   The board also called for a study to develop a more effectiverestraint for children just over 40 pounds or 40 inches tall whomay not be fully protected by ordinary seat belts.   ``It seems time to provide protection for those children who upuntil now have been unprotected,'' said Kolstad after the boardvote.   Asked if the possible increased cost for travelers could bejustified, Kolstad said, ``I don't think the cost of protecting aninfant's life is too much to ask.''   He said the practice of allowing infants to fly in parents' lapsis ``a hole in the law ... an oversight we think needs to becorrected.''</TEXT></DOC>
