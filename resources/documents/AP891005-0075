The ban, previously approved by the House, cleared the Senate,91-9. It was returned to the House for consideration of changesmade by the Senate.   Key votes came on two GOP-sponsored changes in wording thatDemocrats said would skew careful phrasing that was designed tobeat back expected court challenges to the bill's constitutionality.   Republican critics say the bill already is likely to fail such acourt test. They call for a constitutional amendment as urged byPresident Bush after the Supreme Court in June overturned thecriminal conviction on Texas flag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson on theground his freedom of speech had been violated.   The ruling resulted in a public reaction that fueledcongressional action.   The skirmishing on the Senate floor, however, was betweenDemocrats seeking to push through their bill through andRepublicans hoping replace it with the proposed amendment. Thatmeasure comes up later this month.   In rapid succession, the Senate first refused, 69-31, to kill anamendment offered by Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., that would make ita crime to ``physically defile'' the flag. It then adopted by awide margin Wilson's measure, which Democratic sponsors said wouldnudge the bill toward constitutional problems on free-speechgrounds.   The Senate then voted, 53-47, to kill a proposal by MinorityLeader Bob Dole, R-Kan., to exempt flag defacement that took placein private. Sponsors also said that could make the measurevulnerable.   Those voting against the final bill were Dole and Sens. John H.Chaffee, R-R.I.; Charles Grassley, R-Iowa; Orrin Hatch, R-Utah;Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.; Bob Kerrey,D-Neb.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y.   The bill calls for up to a $1,000 fine and year in jail foranyone who burns and American flag or defaces it in any one ofseveral other ways.   Federal law already bans flag burning, but senators say the lawcontains constitutional pitfalls similar to the ones in the Texasstatute.   Conservative Republicans urge the amendment on grounds that itwould settle the issue once and for all _ it could not bechallenged in court.   Many Democrats retort that amending the Constitution should beonly a last resort and that one act of burning is no cause to limitthe freedom of speech.   ``Of all things, today in the United States of America we needto encourage our people to be less afraid, speaking what theybelieve, letting their hearts and minds give rise to what theytruly think ought to be done,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.   Proponents of a constitutional amendment, however, scoff at thenotion that any statute can be drawn that would survive a courtchallenge on freedom of speech grounds.   ``The statutory approach in my opinion is a futile andineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test atall,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah.   Some senators say they detect a distinct cooling of the issue inthe months since the Supreme Court ruling.   ``There's no grass roots firestorm for jailing flag burners norfor amending the Constitution,'' said Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum,D-Ohio.   But Metzenbaum said enough passion remains that lawmakers arewary of opposing a ban.   ``I think that some of us are afraid to stand up for ourprinciples ... afraid the people won't understand that,'' he said.``I think we're afraid that our opponents in the next election willbe even less understanding.''   He and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said they would opposeboth the bill and the constitutional amendment, saying either wouldtake away rights.   ``Patriotism is not the issue,'' Kennedy said. ``Free speechis.''   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., was among lawmakers who planned tovote for both the bill and the amendment.   ``The flag represents the very heart of what it means to be anAmerican and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power beundermined through legal desecration,'' Heflin said.</TEXT></DOC>
