John R. Vercelloti, a chemist at the department's SouthernRegional Research Center in New Orleans, said the substance, calledchitin, inhibits a warmed-over flavor in uncured meat, poultry orfish that is cooked, stored and reheated.   The additives have shown in laboratory tests to inhibit theoff-taste for up to five days when mixed with hamburger, he said.   Vercelloti, in a report issued here by the department'sAgricultural Research Service, said TV dinners, microwave foods andleftovers are prime candidates for off-tastes. Meats cured withnitrite, such as bacon, ham and lunch meats don't have suchproblems, he said.   The warmed-over flavor also is described by the food industry as``cardboardy'' or ``painty.'' The off-taste is caused when fat inthe uncured meat breaks down as it is reheated.   Vercellotti and a fellow chemist, Allen J. St. Angelo, areseeking a patent on additives made from chitin, which he describedas ``a surplus material from the shellfish industry.'' Chitin ismost commonly found in the shells of lobsters, crabs and othershellfish.   The warmed-over flavor occurs when oxygen in the atmospherebreaks down fats in the meat, the report said. Large amounts ofiron present in meat speeds up the oxidation.   But when the chitin additives are added to the meat, they bindthe iron so it cannot speed up the oxidation, thus slowing down thedevelopment of the warmed-over flavor.   Chitin additives would have to be approved by the Food and DrugAdministration before being available to consumers, the scientistssaid.</TEXT></DOC>
