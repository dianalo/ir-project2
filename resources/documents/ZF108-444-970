 While Cypress/ROSSintroduced only a pin-reduced, lower-cost integer unit, LSI has gone furtherby announcing an &quot;Integrated System Controller&quot; that significantly reducesthe number of chips required to make a complete system.andP;  The ISC is, however,a paper tiger at the moment -- samples are promised for the third quarter,with production in the first quarter of next year.andM;LSI Logic has previously announced two different SPARC integer units: theL64801, which is pin-compatible with Fujitsu's S-20 and S-25, and the L64811,which is pin-compatible with Cypress/ROSS's 7C601.andP;  The new integer unit isthe L64901, which is derived from the Fujitsu-compatible L64801 design.andP;  The801 has seven register windows, as compared to eight in the 811, and also hasa simpler pipeline design, so the chip size is smaller.andP;  Thus, it was thenatural choice for LSI to use as the base for the low-cost 901.andM;Both LSI Logic and Cypress/ROSS took similar approaches to developing acost-reduced integer unit: take an existing design, remove some features tosave pins, and package it in a PQFP.andP;  There are several differences, however.andO;While Cypress/ROSS kept the floating-point interface but reduced the addressbus to 24 bits, LSI kept a full 32-bit address bus but eliminated thefloating-point coprocessor interface.andM;LSI Logic had a bit more flexibility than Cypress/ROSS, since the L64901 is anew design and not just a partial pin-out of an existing chip.andP;  This allowedLSI to make some small changes, such as making the interrupt inputsactive-low instead of active-high, and improving the bus timing.andP;  Suchchanges are much easier for LSI to make, since the processor is based ontheir standard-cell ASIC technology, while Cypress/ROSS's 7C601 is afull-custom design.andM;LSI Logic has priced the L64901 at $86 in 1000s for the 20-MHz version in aPQFP package.andP;  This is $10 higher than Cypress/ROSS's 7C611 at 25 MHz.andP;  Inaddition to the higher clock speed, the Cypress/ROSS part should be slightlyfaster due to its more complex pipeline and, depending on the application,the additional register window.andP;  As both of these chips enter volumeproduction, we expect that competition will drive them to very similar pricesat equal clock rates.andM;Integrated System ControllerandM;The L64951 Integrated System Controller (ISC) is the first integrated systemsupport logic chip for embedded SPARC systems.andP;  Figure 1 shows the pinfunctions for this chip.andP;  The functions it provides include:andM;* Cache control logic for an 8-Kbyte, 32-Kbyte, or 128-Kbyte direct-mapped,write-through, unified cache.andM;* Eight programmable chip selects for memory or I/O devices, each of whichcan be programmed for the address range and number of wait states.andP;  Eachaddress region also has two 4-bit protection fields, one for user mode andone for supervisor mode.andP;  For each region, data reads, data writes, andinstruction fetches can be individually allowed or prohibited.andM;* Memory controller for up to four banks of DRAM, using either 1-Mbit or4-Mbit chips for 1 Mbyte to 64 Mbytes of memory.andP;  Provides programmable RASand CAS for each bank, and supports fast page mode.andM;* Eight memory protection or debug breakpoint registers, which cause a trapon access to selected address ranges.andP;  Each register can be used individuallywith any number of &quot;don't care&quot; bits for a [2.sup.n] size block, or tworegisters can be used in a pair to set high and low address limits for ablock of arbitrary size.andM;* Clock buffers to provide minimum-skew clocks for the processor and othersystem logic.andM;* Schmitt-trigger reset circuit.andM;* Interrupt control logic for eight external and several internal interrupts,each of which can be individually masked.andM;* Three-channel DMA controller.andP;  Two channels are designed for use by I/Odevices.andP;  The third channel is for use by the CPU to perform block moves.andM;The capabilities provided by the ISC go a long way toward making SPARC moresuitable for embedded applications.andP;  While a traditional MMU is not provided,embedded systems generally don't need (or want) a Unix-style MMU.andP;  The simpleprotection functions provided by the ISC are more appropriate for embeddedsystems, and are especially useful when the system is being debugged.andM;System ConfigurationandM;Figure 2 shows a block diagram of a typical system with cache.andP;  All cachecontrol logic is included in the ISC.andP;  Six standard SRAMs (2KX8, 8KX8, or32KX8) provide the cache memory and tags.andP;  Four of the SRAMs are used fordata, and two for tags.andP;  For 25-MHz operation, 25-ns RAMs are required; 35-nsRAMs can be used for 20-MHz operation.andP;  Because the cache access is builtinto the integer unit's pipeline, the tag RAMs do not need to be any fasterthan the data RAMs.andM;Two octal comparators (for comparing the processor address to the tags), twooctal buffers, and two octal registers are also required.andP;  The cachearchitecture is quite simple: a write-through memory update policy, no writebuffering, and a one-word line size.andM;The ISC provides RAS and CAS signals for each DRAM bank, along with anaddress multiplexer control signal.andP;  (An external address multiplexer isrequired.)andP;  The banks are not interleaved.andP;  At 20 MHz, 70- or 80-ns RAMs arerequired for zero-wait-state access on a page hit; the first access outsidethe page takes a total of four cycles (three wait states).andP;  The 80-ns DRAMscan be used in small systems with minimal bus loading, while larger systemswill require 70-ns chips.andM;Using 256KX4 DRAMs, a single bank requires only eight chips and provides 1Mbyte of memory.andP;  A 4-Mbyte system can be built with 1-Mbit or 4-Mbit chips.andO;Using 4M X 1 RAMs, a single bank provides 16 Mbytes, and the maximumfour-bank system provides 64 Mbytes.andM;For minimum cost, the cache system can be eliminated.andP;  DRAM-only systems arepossible, but will suffer in performance unless the number of page hits isvery high.andP;  Systems that don't need much RAM might use all SRAM; the accesstime required is the same as for the cache RAMs.andP;  Another alternative is amix of SRAM and DRAM, with the programmer allocating code and/or data to SRAMto optimize performance.andM;The CompetitionandM;The combination of the L64901 integer unit and L64951 ISC make SPARCcompetitive for a much broader range of embedded applications.andP;  Untilrecently, Motorola's 68020 was the leading processor for high-end embeddedcontrol, but the superior price/performance of RISC processors has steadilyeroded the 68020's popularity for new designs.andP;  The two leading contendersare AMD's 29000 and Intel's 960 family, and LSI's new chip set compares quitefavorably.andM;LSI rates the L64901 at 12.5 MIPS at 20 MHz, but does not specify what sortof MIPS these are or what memory system is assumed.andP;  Without benchmark data,it is difficult to evaluate how the performance will compare to the 29000 orthe 960, but it should be in the same ball-park at the same clock frequency.andM;The 29000's MMU is much more sophisticated than the simple protection logicprovided by the ISC.andP;  While most embedded applications don't need such anMMU, many designers have found it to be useful.andP;  Intel's 960 family has noMMU or protection logic at all, except in the mil-spec 960MC.andM;Intel's 960CA has the most similar set of functions to the LSI Logic chippair.andP;  Both the 960CA and LSI chip pair have a programmable wait-stategenerator, DMA controller, and interrupt controller, and neither has anysupport for floating point hardware.andP;  Because of its superscalar design, the960CA should be significantly faster than the LSI Logic chip set.andM;The LSI Logic chip pair goes beyond the AMD and Intel solutions in providingintegrated control logic for an external cache.andP;  On the other hand, the Inteland AMD chips both have some on-chip cache, so external cache is not asimportant.andP;  LSI's design is the only one to provide DRAM control.andM;Another advantage of the LSI Logic design is that both chips are implementedas ASICs, so they can be modified by high-volume users to meet theirrequirements.andP;  The integer unit is about 20,000 gates, while the ISC is about15,000 gates.andP;  LSI is now producing gate arrays up to 50,000 gates, so interms of complexity, it is feasible to combine the functions of the twochips.andP;  The problem in providing all the functions of both chips on a singledevice is that the number of pins becomes too large for low-cost packages,and the die itself could become pad-limited.andP;  For applications that need onlysome of the functions of the ISC or allow some address lines or other CPUsignals to be deleted, combining the two chips into one may be feasible.andM;SPARC has the benefit of high-quality software development and debuggingtools developed for workstations.andP;  Familiarity with the architecture is alsoan advantage; for an engineer who is comfortable developing code for hisSPARCstation, being able to use the same processor architecture in anembedded application is appealing.andM;Intel and AMD, on the other hand, have a richer set of hardware developmenttools, including in-circuit emulators and logic analyzers with disassemblycapability.andP;  Because the SPARC market is split among several differentpin-outs, with more to come, developing an in-circuit emulator isimpractical.andM;ConclusionsandM;In the early stages of the evolution of RISC, all of the vendors targetedworkstations and general-purpose computers.andP;  Because of the key importance ofa wide variety of third-party applications, however, this market is difficultfor new architectures to penetrate.andP;  Furthermore, given the dominance of theIntel/IBM standard for desktop business computers, the volumes in theRISC-based system area aren't exciting.andP;  As a result, some RISCarchitectures, such as AMD's 29000 and Intel's 960, are now marketed solelyfor embedded control applications.andM;Now that the SPARC and MIPS camps feel relatively secure in their positionsin the general-purpose computing market, the chip vendors are pushing intoembedded control in a search for more sockets.andP;  The cost-reduced integerunits are uninteresting, except for their pricing.andP;  LSI Logic's ISC chip, onthe other hand, will help make SPARC a viable competitor to the 29000 and 960families for embedded applications.andM;The other key architecture in this battle is MIPS.andP;  LSI Logic is licensed toproduce the MIPS chips as well as SPARC, and indeed is shipping the standardR3000 and R3010, in addition to a write-buffer chip designed for DEC.andP;  LSIappears to be focusing their initial development efforts on SPARC, however.andO;The MIPS architecture is no less suitable for embedded control than is theSPARC architecture.andP;  In fact, IDT has taken a first step toward a versioncustomized for embedded control with the R3001.andM;In the coming year, we expect to see more versions of MIPS and SPARCprocessors for embedded control.andP;  Fujitsu has plans to develop their ownembedded SPARC line, and Philips announced last year that they would developSPARC-based processors for embedded applications.andP;  IDT has led the MIPS pushinto embedded control, and other vendors are likely to follow.andP;  This flood ofnew devices is going to put pressure on Intel and AMD, which have so far beenconcentrating on battling each other for the high-end embedded controlmarket.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
