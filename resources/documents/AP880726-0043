ALLEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Guards quelled an uprising at the overcrowded177-year-old Maryland Penitentiary in less than an hour, butofficials were unsure today what sparked the knifings and gunshotsthat left 12 people injured.   In Massachusetts, about 30 inmates, some with metal pipes andclubs, brawled in an exercise yard at a maximum-security prison,officials said. Two sustained minor injuries in Monday'sdisturbance.   Authorities here were trying to determine whether a correctionsofficer shot a fellow guard during Monday afternoon's riot. Theinjured officer was one of four guards still hospitalized todayafter order was restored at the downtown maximum-security prison.   In all, eight guards, three inmates and a prison psychologistsuffered broken bones, knife wounds or gunshot wounds in the melee,which was confined to the recreation yard and crisis clinic,officials said.   ``I think the warden acted properly. I think ... he took actionas soon has he felt there was something unusual happening,'' Gov.William Donald Schaefer said in defense of prison warden JamesRollins.   Schaefer said that after Rollins noticed only a few inmatesturned up for breakfast and lunch, he bolstered the 116-guard forceby transferring some officers from administrative posts to the yard.   The disturbance began in a yard about 12:45 p.m., spread to theclinic where the psychologist was conducting a session withinmates, and erupted again in another section of the yard, said astate police spokesman, Cpl. Greg Shipley. He said a minor firealso was set in the clinic.   ``There were assaults on guards by groups of inmates,'' Shipleysaid.   Shipley didn't know if the disturbances were coordinated. Hesaid the penitentiary tactical force suited up in riot helmets andbatons to quell the uprisings.   The prison was locked down by early afternoon and remained sotoday, officials said. Two homemade knives and two baseball batswere recovered.   Throughout the day and evening, city police officers remainedstationed near the 1811 prison, the nation's second-oldest, andhelicopters circled.   One inmate was in critical condition after surgery for gunshotwounds to the head and neck, while another was in fair conditionwith a gunshot wound to the head, said Johns Hopkins Hospital.   One guard was listed as serious at Hopkins and one was insurgery there early today.   Two other guards were listed as stable at Mercy Medical Center.Four guards and the pyschologist were not hospitalized.   Spokesmen for two of the three unions representing the guardsblasted corrections officials for deteriorating conditions at theprison, which housed 1,270 inmates on Monday though it's supposedto hold 700 to 800.   In Massachusetts, officials said the brawl at the Cedar Junctionprison at Walpole was divided along racial lines and may haveresulted from the stabbing of a black prisoner by three whitesSunday night. The victim was hospitalized in stable condition withstab wounds to the chest.   On Monday, 60 to 70 inmates climbed through the windows of anindustrial workshop to try to join the brawl, but were stopped whena tower guard fired warning shots into the air, said DeodatoArruda, a state Department of Correction spokesman.   Arruda said the fighting lasted less than 15 minutes. Twoinmates suffered cuts requiring ``two or three stitches'' at theprison infirmary.   No guards were injured, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
