Box 9, Lincoln Center, MA 01773; (503)369-8175.andM;Version: 1.1.andM;List Price: $295.andM;If you write Mac applications, you spend a great deal of time writinguser-interface code.andP;  The NEXT Interface Builder is an excellent example of atool for developing a user interface graphically, but no Mac tools offercomparable functionality.andP;  AppMaker comes very close, though.andM;AppMaker 1.1 lets you design menus, windows, and dialog boxes by usingdrawlike tools.andP;  It then generates the necessary resources and source codefor the user interface.andP;  All you need to add is the functionalnon-user-interface part.andP;  Source-code generation based on drawn prototypes isnothing new.andP;  What's special about AppMaker is that it generates code forTHINK's Class Library, either the Object C or the Object Pascal version.andO;Also, once AppMaker has generated the code, it still lets you go back andedit what you were working on previously.andP;  This is made even easier becauseof object-oriented programming's encapsulation feature, in which objects areself-contained but extensible without having to edit an object's originalsource file: the source generated by AppMaker never needs to be edited.andM;Although AppMaker has quite a way to go compared with NeXT's InterfaceBuilder, it's the first Mac tool that permits graphical design of standardMac user-interface elements based on an object-oriented framework.andP;  AppMakeralleviates much of the tedious programming required when using standard Macuser-interface elements in your software, letting you develop basic,Macintosh-like applications much faster.andP;  If you want to generateapplications quickly, AppMaker is a real help.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
