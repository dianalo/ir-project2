That is just what has happened in Argentina in recentweeks, where both Deputy Secretary of State LawrenceEagleburger -- privately -- and U.S. Ambassador TerenceTodman -- publicly -- have pressed President Carlos SaulMenem to clean up government corruption.</LP><TEXT>   Their effort helped boost Argentine economy minister ErmanGonzalez's own struggling efforts to counter corruption. Lastweek these efforts prompted President Menem to replace mostof his cabinet and to bring in the World Bank to umpire thecountry's big drive to privatize state companies.   The widening U.S. campaign against corruption in LatinAmerica also involves investigations into dealings that havegone on in the foreign debt market, which, throughdebt-for-equity swaps, is increasingly important to LatinAmerica's attempt to privatize state assets.   In 1988 and 1989, about $16.3 billion of Brazil's foreigndebt was &quot;informally&quot; converted by U.S. and other foreignbanks and companies into equity investments in that country,according to Assesoria Economica, a consulting firm in SaoPaulo. Director Alberto Ades describes the informal debtconversion activities as &quot;a formidable business, but also anillegal one&quot; under both U.S. and Brazilian law. It is widelybelieved in Brazil and other Latin American countries thatfees to such transactions are often bribes to localofficials.   If so, for U.S. companies, that would violate the ForeignCorrupt Practices Act which essentially forbids U.S. concernsfrom paying off officials in foreign countries to gainadvantage for their businesses.   The recent squabble in Argentina involved a rare case of aU.S. company complaining to the U.S. authorities about beingpressed for bribes by local officials. Late last yearSwift-Armour, an Argentine subsidiary of Campbell Soup Inc.,complained that it was asked to pay bribes to a senior localofficial to obtain a tax exemption, U.S. and Argentineofficials say.   Swift-Armour was legally entitled to the tax exemption,which applied to machinery for a $115 million project to helpprocess beef for Campbell's soups. The company refused tomake the payoff and complained to the U.S. authorities, U.S.and Argentine officials say. Mr. Eagleburger and AmbassadorTodman took up the case, with Mr. Eagleburger raising theissue at the time of President Bush's visit to Argentina inDecember.   Mr. Todman used the case to press the view that corruptionhad become common in Argentina, sparking a sharp publicexchange between him and some in the government in earlyJanuary. After his public complaints, Mr. Todman was rebukedby President Menem for impugning Argentina's honor.   But last week Mr. Menem suddenly reversed himself. Hefired almost his whole cabinet, and ordered that the publicworks ministry be absorbed into the economy ministry,Argentine officials said.   Meanwhile, Swift-Armour got its tax exemption and thecompany has retracted its statement regarding allegedcorruption, U.S. and Argentine officials said.   A spokesman for Campbell Soup at the company's Camden,N.J., headquarters declined to comment on the matter. Thereis no suggestion that Swift-Armour engaged in any wrongdoing;on the contrary, officials say, it blew the whistle oncorruption.</TEXT></DOC>
