Written comments should be sent to the Policy Office and shouldrefer to the docket number that appears in the heading of this document.Any person desiring an opportunity for oral presentation of views as providedunder the Poultry Products Inspection Act must make such request to Dr.David Berkowitz so that arrangements may be made for such views to be presented.A record will be made of all views orally presented. All comments submittedin response to this action will be made available for public inspectionin the Policy Office between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., Monday through Friday.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>On March 30, 1988, a task force was established by the Administrator, FSIS,to study how FSIS currently reviews and approves rapid analytical diagnostic,and microbiological tests, and to make recommendations to improve the process.Currently, there is no established formal procedure for reviewing and approvingtests in FSIS. Each test is reviewed on an individual basis by the appropriateAgency division. Under this procedure, there is a potential for duplicatingsome efforts of other government agencies and for applying nonuniform criteria.The task force recommended that the Agency establish a formal process toreview testing systems submitted for approval. The task force also recommendedthat the Agency establish review and approval criteria for tests.New developments, particularly in biotechnology, have made tests availablethat allow for diagnostic and residue testing in slaughter plants and onfarms. As part of the Agency's effort to incorporate scientific tests,FSIS would like to continue to integrate these new technologies into theinspection process. The Agency wants to encourage the development of rapidtests suitable for regulatory screening, and to facilitate the test reviewand aproval process for such testing systems without compromising scientificstandards.The proposed test review and approval process is discussed below in termsof organizational structure, review process, and information required forreview and approval. The final sections discuss proprietary information,approval by other agencies, markets for tests, expiration of approvals,redundant applications, and false statements. Comments are solicited onany or all of these points.<ITAG tagnum="84">Organizational Structure</ITAG>The Deputy Administrator for Technical Services would have the responsibilityfor the entire test review and approval process. All official decisionson tests would be communicated to the applicant by the Deputy Administrator.The review process would be coordinated by the Technology Transfer andAssessment Staff, a part of Technical Services. The director of TechnologyTransfer and Assessment would be the Coordinator for the test review process.The organizational structure for the test review process would includea Coordinator, a Test Review Steering Committee, and Techical Reviewers.The Coordinator would oversee the operations of the review process andwould serve as the executive secretariat to the Test Review Steering Committee.The Coordinator would be responsible for gathering, organizing, and assessingany information required for the review process, making recommendationsto the Steering Committee, and to the Deputy Administrator, and assuringthat all participants in the review of a test are informed and have accessto the required information. The Coordinator would also be responsiblefor the exchange of information between FSIS and the applicant and betweenFSIS and other agencies when concurrent reviews are necessary.The Test Review Steering Committee would consider the Agency priority ofproposed tests, safety and policy questions related to the test results,and would be advisory to the Deputy Administrator who would chair the committee.The permanent members would include representatives from the Meat and PoultryInspection Operations and Science programs and the Test Review Coordinator.Additional people with special expertise would be asked to participateas <T3>ad hoc </T3>members as required by the circumstances related to thetest being considered.A Technical Reviewer would be appointed by the Coordinator for each testreviewed. The Technical Reviewer would assemble a committee of subjectmatter experts, including a statistician, to review the technical performanceof the test. The Technical Reviewer would make formal written recommendationsto the Coordinator.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Review Process</ITAG>The FSIS review and approval process would have four major milestones.The first would be the Deputy Administrator's decision to review the test.The second would be the approval of the report on the laboratory performanceof the test by the Coordinator. The third would be the acceptance of thecollaborative study by the Coordinator, and the fourth would be the finalconsideration by the Steering Committee and the decision by the DeputyAdministrator to approve the test. Applicants would be required to contactthe Coordinator to prepare for each milestone. The laboratory performancephase of the test would have to be acceptable before the collaborativestudy is initiated.When a test application is received, the Coordinator would refer the applicationto the Test Review Steering Committee for an evaluation of Agency interest.The Steering Committee would make a recommendation to the Deputy Administrator.If the test is not likely to be incorporated into Agency programs in thefuture, the Deputy Administrator would return the application to the sender.If there is Agency interest, the Deputy Administrator would inform theapplicant, and the Coordinator would send the application to a TechnicalReviewer. The Agency intends to complete this first phase of the processwithin 60 days of the receipt of the application.A Technical Reviewer may be in FSIS, in another Agency, or in a non-governmentorganization. The Technical Reviewer would review the submitted materialwith the committee of experts and, based on the criteria for test performance,make a recommendation to the Coordinator for or against test approval.The Coordinator would take into consideration the recommendation of theTechnical Reviewer as well as other information assembled for the SteeringCommittee and recommend approval or non-approval of the test to the Committee.The Steering Committee would consider factors such as human safety, Agencypolicy, and the availability of money and personnel. After consulting withthe Steering Committee, the Deputy Administrator would approve or rejectthe test, and inform the applicant of the decision.<ITAG tagnum="84">Information Required for Review and Approval</ITAG>The Agency is eager to apply new technologies to improve food safety inthe inspection program. The rate at which FSIS can do this is limited bythe availability of money and staff, forcing FSIS to ignore many excellenttests simply because they are not among the Agency's highest priorities.Resources will not be committed to the review of testing systems unlessthey are likely to be used as a basis for Agency regulatory decisions;e.g., the results of the test will be used to retain product or to grantspecial status to a group of animals. Tests unlikely to be incorporatedinto regulatory programs in the foreseeable future will not be reviewed.This decision reflects the legal restriction on the Agency that permitsexpenditures only for the conduct of the meat and poultry inspection program.To approve a test, FSIS must have a high level of assurance that the testwill measure what it is expected to measure and will perform as described.Agency approval of a test must mean that the test results can be used asa basis for Agency decisionmaking, when the quality control and qualityassurance measures are part of the test and when the test is performedby trained analysts. This document describes the general kinds of informationthat would be required in an application for this assurance and the formatfor applications. The Technical Reviewer would provide more detailed criteriafor each specific test. The Reviewer and Coordinator would consult on specialproblems, and to be certain that the criteria for any given test are inline with the criteria for similar tests.The Agency would require a clear, well-organized, and thorough presentationof the information for review. Applications for test approval would haveto be prepared in the format of a scientific paper. (Those who have publishedor are planning to publish their work could submit the manuscript or areprint. The additional information which would be required by FSIS, ofthe type not likely to be included in a paper for publication, could beattached as an appendix.) The scope of the information proposed to be requiredby FSIS is outlined below in the order in which it would usually appearin a scientific paper. This is followed by a list of the information FSISwould need that is not likely to be included in the usual scientific paperdescribing a test.The application should begin with summary statements about the purposeof the test, the matrices, the intended species, the potential uses, andthe significance of the test. The principle on which the assay is based,the unique features of the assay and characteristic parameters such aslowest limit of detection, limit of reliable measurement, a measure ofthe precision or, for ``yes/no'' tests, false positive and false negativerates should be given.More detailed introductory statements should provide a framework for evaluatingthe test. The problem the test was designed to solve should be described.The applicant should explain the advantage of this test over other testsand technologies currently available.The second section should describe the equipment, reagents, and the methodwith enough details so that a peer could repeat the work without recourseto the authors. The preparation or sources of reagents and equipment wouldhave to be described. The properties of equipment or complex reagents,the criteria which make them acceptable, the workable operating temperaturerange, and the stability and shelf-life for reagents, standards, and mediawould also have to be described.The third section would present laboratory data describing the characteristicsof the test. Using the intended matrix, the data should include a representativeplot of the test response versus the concentration of analyte, includingstandard deviations, across the range of interest. For nonquantitativescreening tests, points slightly above and below the decision points areespecially important and should have more replicates. For quantitativeassays, concentrations near the tolerance or other decision points shouldalso be stressed. Whenever possible, the test response versus concentrationcurve should be directly compared with the curve produced by an existingaccepted method. The values given in the summary would have to be supportedwith data. The laboratory characterization would also include analysesof samples taken from the field. Field samples may reveal problems withan analytical method that can only be discovered by gathering informationfrom the targeted test population. Where insufficient field samples areavailable, animals should be experimentally treated (administered drugsor chemicals or be experimentally infected with pathogens) to approximatethe field situation.The results of a designed ruggedness test would be presented as part ofthe test description. Special attention should be given to likely interferencessuch as dust or temperature conditions likely to be encountered in theenvironment of the intended use of the test.Specificity is a major concern. The potential for detecting compounds otherthan the compound of interest should be tested. Special emphasis wouldbe given to those compounds likely to be present, for example, closelyrelated metabolites, antigens, or other substances. The specificity ofserological tests is usually established by examining test performanceon panels of known positive and negative sera. Criteria for the selectionof panels of serum for establishing the false negative and false positiverates of serological tests should be presented. The composition of thetest panel should be related to what is known about the composition ofthe targeted test population.The applicants should assume that the submitted material would be reviewedby people who have no prior knowledge of the assay. The data should beclearly presented so the reviewers have the opportunity to reach the sameconclusions as the applicant. The reviewers should not have to make assumptionsabout what was done or what the units of measurement are. All tables andgraphs should have numbers, titles, and legends. Tables, graphs, and figureswould have to be able to stand alone. The inclusion of copies of key referenceswill facilitate the review process. The applicant would be asked to provideraw data for particular experiments if the Technical Reviewer considersit helpful.The discussion should interpret the results, relate them to the intendedpurpose of the test, to previous methods, and to current literature onthe same technology. Logical implications for the extension of the testingsystem to other applications or suggestions for improvements would be helpful.FSIS would require additional information that may not be included in ascientific publication in sufficient detail. Some of these kinds of informationare discussed below.Approval would require a detailed presentation of the planned FSIS useof the test. This would be worked out with the Coordinator (who would consultwith the Steering Committee) and be described with supporting reasoningfor the agreed-upon plan. If FSIS personnel are to purchase and use thetest, the plan would have to include estimates of the cost per test atvarious levels of usage as well as the initial and maintenance costs ofequipment and reagents. The applicant would have to assure a 1-year supplyof special reagents such as standard sera or antibodies. This supply wouldhave to be estimated from projections of the proposed use of the test.The proposal should identify the employment categories of those who wouldcarry out the test, the frequency at which testing must be done, and theaction required by positive and negative tests.Complete protocols written in a form understandable to the proposed testusers would have to be part of the package. If the test is to be performedby non-FSIS personnel, plans for analyst training and certification wouldhave to be described. The need for strict protocol adherence would haveto be emphasized. In all cases, adequate directions for the conduct ofthe test must be provided. If the test is to be performed by farm personnel,inspectors, or others not previously familiar with analytical techniques,extensively illustrated directions may be helpful. This test informationwould be required in considerably more detail than would be required forlaboratory personnel.Any testing system would have to include quality control (QC) and qualityassurance (QA) plans so the Agency can be confident that the system isperforming as intended. QA/QC programs would be required for kit and reagentproduction as well as for the testing process itself.The final data-collection step in the approval process would be a collaborativestudy. The Agency defines collaborative study as a procedure to verifytest performance characteristics using a representative group of analystsand test locations. The results of the collaborative study would be usedas a measure of accuracy and bias, precision (reproducibility and repeatability),and the completeness of the test. Completeness is the percentage of dataactually collected relative to the total amount of data planned, i.e.,a 100 percent complete test has no outliers or aborted runs. The laboratorycharacterization of the test would have to be reviewed before the collaborativestudy is initiated. When a collaborative study is to be conducted in establishmentsor elsewhere by FSIS personnel, the Coordinator would be responsible formaking these arrangements with Meat and Poultry Inspection Operations,FSIS, and other affected staffs. The applicant would be responsible forplanning, executing, and bearing the cost of the entire test developmentprocess, except in special cases requiring FSIS inspection personnel. The Agency specifically seeks comments on the use of field-based collaborativestudies and on the approval point in the test characterization sequence.We are aware that conducting a collaborative study in the field increasesthe variables and may shed an unfavorable light on a technology that couldhave been improved by laboratory adjustments. The Agency is also awarethat approving a test after the collaborative study may prove prematureif subsequent field studies uncover problems with the test. The 1-yearexpiration date for approvals is designed to eliminate tests found unsatisfactoryduring field testing. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proprietary Information </ITAG>All submissions considered by the applicant to be exempt from the provisionsof the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) (5 U.S.C. 552) would have to beaccompanied by a statement describing specific adverse effects of disclosureof any portion of the submission. The applicant's statement should includethe following two sentences: ``It is our position that this submissioncontains confidential commercial information and should not be releasedto a third party. Additionally, Executive Order 12600 requires that younotify us should a determination be made to release this material overour objection here stated.'' Exemption would then be determined on a caseby case basis by FSIS. If more than one section of the application is consideredproprietary, the applicant must submit a document marked ``FOIA'' containingall the necessary information for the review, and a second document containingonly releasable material. <ITAG tagnum="84">Approval by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS)or Other Agencies </ITAG>If an applicant is seeking approval by FSIS and licensing by APHIS, withthe permission of the applicant, the Agencies would share data and conductthe reviews concurrently. Exemption from FOIA would be sustained. The Coordinatorwould attempt to make similar arrangements with other agencies as the needarises so the exempt status is not changed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Market for Commercial Tests </ITAG>Neither the decision by the Deputy Administrator to review a test, northe approval of a test by the Deputy Administrator, would infer or guaranteethe implementation of the test or a regulatory situation that encouragesa market for the test. Regulatory priorities and the commercial test marketmay change during the course of test development and approval, so the marketfor the test would not be guaranteed. Problems not detected by the reviewprocess may be discovered during implementation field tests, and if theseproblems are serious, the Agency would discontinue further considerationor the use of the test in spite of the decision to consider or the approval.This notice would not restrict the prerogative of the Agency to respondin emergency situations. If an approved test is not available, or if atest has not been approved for a required use, the Agency would use themost suitable test available to fulfill its regulatory responsibility inthe interest of public health. After the approval of a test, the Agency would reserve the right to requirethe use of other tests which are more suitable or to purchase other testsavailable at a lower price if the performance is demonstrated to be equallyable to fulfill Agency needs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Expiration of Approvals </ITAG>All approvals will automatically expire 1 year after the date of the originalapproval. Approvals will be reissued when data are presented to the TestReview system demonstrating the satisfactory use of the test in a regulatoryprogram and a record of compliance with the requirements of the Agency'saccredited laboratory program. <ITAG tagnum="84">Redundant Applications </ITAG>If the Agency receives more than one application for the same test, thefirst application approved would be reviewed as described above. Subsequentapplicants would be asked to provide evidence that their test is at leastequivalent to the first approved test. The details of equivalency wouldbe agreed upon with the Technical Reviewer. <ITAG tagnum="84">False Statements </ITAG>Applicants would be subject to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. 1001, whichprovide penalties for knowingly and willingly providing false informationto a government entity. The preamble to any proposed regulations which are issued in this matterwill include a discussion of the comments received in response to thisNotice.<ITAG tagnum="21">Done at Washington, DC on: August 10, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lester M Crawford, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Administrator, Food Safety and Inspection Service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-19234 Filed 8-16-89; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 3410-DM-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
