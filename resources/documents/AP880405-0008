SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   American households have shrunk to theirsmallest size ever, containing just half as many people as at thestart of the Civil War.   The Census Bureau reports that the average household contained2.64 people as of last July 1, continuing a long-term decline. Bycomparison, the 1860 census found an average household of 5.28people.   While the household size has declined, the number of householdshas continued to climb, topping 90 million for the first time in1987, the bureau said Monday.   Household size is shrinking because the number of households isincreasing faster than the overall population. This is occurring,said bureau population expert Campbell Gibson, because of changesin the country's age structure.   The many Americans born in the post-World War II baby boom arenow in their 20s and 30s, when they are most likely to set uphouseholds on their own, he said.   The number of households rose from 80.4 million in 1980 to 88.8million in 1986 and is now past the 90 million mark.   At the same time the average number of persons per householddeclined from 2.75 in 1985 to 2.65 in 1986 and now to 2.64, Gibsonsaid.   By comparison, the 1970 Census found the average householdcontained 3.14 people. In 1930 households averaged more than 4people, and they averaged more than 5 in 1880. The nation's firstcensus in 1790 found an average household size of 5.79 people.   While the growing number of ever smaller households continues atrend, Gibson pointed out that household growth isn't outpacingpopulation increases as fast as in the 1970s.   The same age factors that are increasing households now alsooccurred then, Gibson said. But in addition, in the 1970s theproportion of households in each age group was also growing. Thathas not continued in the 1980s, he said.   ``This could be occurring for a number of reasons,'' Gibson said.   For example, in this decade more young people have chosen toremain home with their parents instead of setting up housekeepingon their own, as many had done in the 1970s. This could be causedby the increasing cost of housing, he said.   Delays in marriage, while young people pursue careers andschool, have also been widely reported as a factor, but Gibsoncautioned that it is too simplistic to attribute all of thehousehold changes to this.   ``There's a whole bunch of things'' that affect the rates, hesaid.   For example, the elderly tend to have high household ratesbecause a fair number are widowed, resulting in many one-personhouseholds.   Continued low birth rates in the United States are also afactor. The presence of children increases household size, whilepopulations with a larger share of adults tend to have smallerhouseholds.   Asked what the future holds, Gibson said he expects to seehouseholds continue to lead population in growth rates over thenext few years. ``But that should change at some point'' as thesmaller ``baby bust'' generation born following the baby boom comesinto the household formation ages.   While the national trend was reflected in most parts of thenation, Gibson cited two states that differ.   In California and Utah, household growth rates were onlyslightly different from those for population, he said.   In California, the increasing number of Hispanic and Asianresidents likely is the reason, Gibson said, since those groupstend to have more people per household.   Utah, Gibson said, has larger households because it maintainshigher fertility than other states, largely because of theinfluence of the Mormon religion.   Households are defined as occupied housing units containing oneor more people. The number of households is, on average, smallerthan the number of families because the definition of a familyrequires at least two people, while there are many one-personhouseholds.</TEXT></DOC>
