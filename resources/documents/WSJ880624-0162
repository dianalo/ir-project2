In addition, Environmental Treatment will pay $5 million in cash and offer 250,000 warrants to purchase its common stock for five years at $15 a share if National Surface Cleaning's 1988 results top last year's. The Methuen, Mass.-based company had $5 million in operating profit and $17.8 million in revenue last year.    Environmental Treatment, which manages hazardous and toxic materials, said the acquisition will give it &quot;the resources to help meet increasing demand for asbestos abatement services from existing clients.&quot; Asbestos removal is becoming a major element of many large decontamination projects, the company added. </TEXT></DOC>
