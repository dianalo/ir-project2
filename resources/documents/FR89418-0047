This postponement was approvedunder section 705 of the Act and published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 13, 1989 (54 FR 6562).We conducted verification in Korea from January 23 through January 27,1989, of the questionnaire responses of the Government of Korea (GOK),Dongil Rubber Belt Co., Ltd. (Dongil), and Taelim Moolsan Co., Ltd. (TaelimMoolsan), a trading company whose exports to the United States are purchasedfrom Dongil. At the GOK we also verified information provided in the GOKresponses with respect to another producer of industrial belts which exportsto the United States, Hankook Belt Industry (Hankook). All the informationsubmitted by the GOK concerning was received prior to verification.Petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing in this case whichwas held on March 16, 1989. Both parties filed pre-hearing briefs on March13, 1989, and post-hearing briefs on March 23, 1989. On March 29, 1989,in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 3 of the Agreement of Interpretationand Application of Articles VI, XVI and XXIII of the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade (GATT Subsidies Code), we notified U.S. Customs toterminate the suspension of liquidation in this investigation as of April1, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq.</T3> of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andcustoms purposes. The Department's written description of the productsunder investigation remains dispositive as to the scope of the productcoverage.The products covered by this investigation are industrial belts and componentsand parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, formerly provided for underTSUSA item numbers 358.0210, 358.0290, 358,0610, 358.0690, 358.0800, 358.0900,358.1100, 358.1400, 358.1600, 657.2520, 773.3510 and 773.3520; and currentlyclassifiable under HTS sub-headings 3926.9055, 3926.9056, 3926.9057, 3926.9059,3926.9060, 4010.1010, 4010.1050, 4010.9111, 4010.9115, 4010.9119, 4010.9150,4010.9911, 4010.9915, 4010.9919, 4010.9950, 5910.0010, 5910.0090 and 7326.2000.The merchandise covered by this investigation includes certain industrialbelts for power transmission. These include V-belts, synchronous belts,round belts and flat belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, andcontaining textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord orstrand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loop) belts, or in beltingin lengths or links. This investigation excludes conveyor belts and automotivebelts as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered byinternal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses and lifttrucks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>As mentioned above, we received and were able to verify the questionnairerespones of Dongil and Taelim. Another producer, Hankook, did not directlyrespond to our questionnaire. However, information with respect to Hankook,which we were also able to verify, was provided in the GOK response. Thisinformation was received prior to verification. A certain limited amountof information pertaining to Hankook was not provided by the GOK and couldnot be verified. For one program described below (see Section I.C.) wherewe did not have verified information with respect to Hankook, we used thebest information available.    We calculated the country-wide estimated net subisdy rate by weight averagingthe respective company-specific rates according to the respondent companies'share of exports of the subject merchandise to the United States. Becausethis rate is <T3>de minimis, </T3>despite Hankook's level of benefits, our final determinationis negative. (See, <T3>Final Negative Counterailing Duty Determinations: Standard Line Pipe.Light-walled Rectangular Tubing and Heavy-Walled Rectangular Tubing fromMalaysia </T3>(53 FR 46904, November 21, 1988); see also preamble discussionof andSection;355.20(d) of the Commerce Department's regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.38), which codifies existing practice.) For informationalpurposes, at the end of the individual program descriptions below, we haveincluded company-specific rates.    For purposes of this final determination, the period for which we are measuringsubsidies (''the review period'') is calendar year 1987 which correspondsto the fiscal year of Dongil.Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires,verification, and written comments filed by petitioner and respondents,we determine the following:I. Programs Determined to Confer SubsidiesWe determine that subsidies are being provided to manufacturers, producersand exports in Korea of industrial belts under the following programs:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Short-Term Export Financing</ITAG>The Short-Term Export Financing Regulations provide the guidelines forshort-term export financing. Under these regulations, export financingtakes the form of loans on bills related to export sales transactions.Eligibility is based upon presentation of export documents or upon pastexport performance. Export loans based on past performance cannot exceed90 days, while loans based on specific export documents cannot exceed 180days and are limited to the terms of the applicable letter of credit. Duringour review period, the rate of interest charged on short-term export financingremained constant at ten percent, the ceiling established by the Bank ofKorea (BOK).Short-term export financing is available in Korea to finance three typesof transactions: (1) Purchases of imported materials, (2) purchases ofdomestic material, and (3) production. Each type of transaction carrieswith it a ``loan exchange ratio,'' This ratio, expressed in won, determinesthe maximum won loan amount per dollar value of the transaction. The ratiovaried between small- and medium-sized companies on the one hand, and large-sizedcompanies on the other. We verified that the exchange ratios in effectduring the review period were reduced as of February 8, 1988.The BOK also establishes rediscount ratios that set the proportion of ashort-term loan which the commercial bank may rediscount through the centralbank. During the period of investigation, the rediscount ratio for short-termexport financing was lowered from 60 percent to 40 percent for large-sizedfirm, and from 90 percent to 60 percent for small- and medium-sized firms.The rediscount ratio on domestic commercial financing remained at 60 percentfor large-sized companies. Small- and medium-sized firms are defined ascompanies with fewer than 300 employees. We verified that both Dongil andHankook are classified as large companies.We verified that both Hankook and Dongil received financing under thisprogram. Because only exporters are eligible to use short-term export financing,we determine these loans to be countervailable to the extent that theyare provided on preferential terms. Moreover, we determine that the differentrediscount ratios applicable to financing for the large firms during thereview period resulted in the provisions of export financing on preferentialterms for large firms. This is because in lending to large firms, commercialbanks had an incentive to channel more funds to finance those firms' exporttransactions and, thus, fewer funds to finance their domestic transactions.This is the same analysis we employed in <T3>Certain Stainless Steel Cooking Ware from the Republic of Korea: FinalAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination </T3>(51 FR 42687, November26, 1986) (<T3>Cooking Ware</T3>). At verification, we found that in September 1988,the BOK equalized the rediscount ratios.To determine the extent to which these loans are provided on preferentialterms, we used verified information provided by the GOK to construct aweighted-average short-term interest rate to represent what large firmspay to finance domestic transactions. Because, during the review period,commercial banks had an incentive to direct their loans to large firmsfor financing export transactions rather than domestic transactions, largefirms would have needed to seek alternative sources for financing domesticsales.The weighted-average interest rate we have computed is a best estimatemeasure of the preference created by the different rediscount ratios. Itincudes the interest rates on commercial bank loans for domestic transactions;the issuance of commercial paper; and financing from investment and financecompanies, merchant banking companies, and mutual savings and finance companies.We verified that these sources constitute all the forms of short-term commercialfinancing in Korea. They differ from those used in our <T3>Preliminary Determination </T3>in that we have deleted mutual creditcooperatives and included merchant banking companies. We verified thatthe former were used as a source of short-term finance almost exclusivelyby households and the latter were a source for companies.The GOK does not maintain detailed statistical information concerning theweighted-average or average interest rate charged by commercial banks.The BOK annual report only lists the interest rate bands within which banksare permitted to make loans Therefore, to determine an average interestrate for commercial banks in Korea, we used as the best information availablethe results of a survey of Korean commercial banks conducted by the GOK.The survey provides the percentage of short-term loans offered by a numberof Korean national and local commercial banks at half-percent intervalswithin the interest rate band allowed by the BOK. Local commercial banksare allowed to charge interest rates up to one percent higher than nationalcommercial banks. We verified that local banks account for 9.1 percentof all commercial bank loans, and national banks, 90.9 percent. We thenweight average the national and local commercial bank average interestrates to determine a single weighted-average commercial bank interest ratefor the review period of 11.15 percent.The weights assigned to each of the other sources of short-term domesticcredit (<T3>i.e., </T3>commercial paper, financing from investment and financecompanies, merchant banking companies, and mutual savings and finance companies)were derived from the BOK <T3>Monthly Bulletin. </T3>From the <T3>Monthly Bulletin, </T3>we determined the amount of, and interest ratescharged on, short-term financing from each of these sources.Using the above data, we calculated a weighted-average short-term interestrate benchmark of 11.79 percent. We compared this rate to the 10 percentinterest rate on export loans received by Dongil and Hankook. (We verifiedthat Taelim Moolsan did not receive any export loans during the periodof review.) To determine the benefit of the preferential interest rate,we subtracted the interest paid on the export loans at 10 percent fromthe interest the companies would have paid if the loans had been contractedat the benchmark.Because the benefit was not segregable by product or market, we dividedthe benefit by the total exports of the respective companies during thereview period. On this basis, we calculated an estimated net subsidy of0.14 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Dongil and 0.17 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Hankook. The country-wide rate equals 0.14 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">B. Export Tax Reserves Under Articles 22 and 23 </ITAG>Articles 22 and 23 of the Act Concerning the Regulation of Tax Reductionand Exemption permit deductions from taxable income by exporting firmsfor a number of different reserves covering export losses, overseas marketdevelopment and price fluctuation losses. Under Article 22, a corporation may establish a reserve amounting to thelesser of one percent of foreign exchange earnings or 50 percent of theforeign exchange earnings component of net income. It certain export lossesoccur, they may be offset by the reserve fund. Following the tax year inwhich the reserve amount was created, there is a one-year grace period.After the grace period, amounts remaining in the reserve that have notbeen offset by actual losses are returned to the taxable income accountin three equal annual installments. Article 23, which governs overseas market development funds, allows a corporationto establish a reserve fund amounting to one percent if its foreign exchangeearnings in the respective tax year. Expenses incurred in development overseasmarkets may be offset from the reserve fund. Funds remaining in the reserveafter the tax year are treated as under Article 22. The balance in both reserve funds is not subject to corporate tax, althoughall moneys in the reserve funds, if not used to offset losses, are eventuallyreturned to income and subject to corporate tax. We determine that these export reserves programs confer benefits whichconstitute export subsidies because they provide a deferment, contingentupon export performance, of direct taxes. We verified that Dongil and Hankook,but not Taelim Moolsan, utilized the provisions under the export tax reserves.To measure the benefit conferred by the deferments, we followed the samemethodology previously use in <T3>Cooking Ware </T3>and calculated the tax savings by multiplying theamount maintained in the reserves by the companies' effective tax rates.We treated the tax savings on these funds as short-term interest-free loans.Accordingly, to determine the benefit, the amount of the companies' taxsavings was multiplied by the average short-term national and local commercialbank interest rate (11.15%) which we calculated under the section above.On this basis, we calculated an estimated net subsidy of 0.13 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Dongil and 0.00 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for Hankook. The country-wide rate is 0.12 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">C. Duty Drawback on Non-Physically Incorporated Items and Allowancesfor Excessive Loss and Wastage Rates </ITAG>We examined the Korean duty drawback system to determine whether the companiesunder investigation were receiving benefits from the allowance of dutydrawback on non-physically incorporated items and on recoverable scrap.We verified that input usage rates are determined every four years forproducers of exported products. The survey upon which the GOK based itsinput usage rates was based on an audited survey of Dongil's productionprocess. Tables of these rates are used by Korean Customs for duty drawbackpurposes. We verified that recoverable scrap is factored into the usage rates andthat, therefore, for Dongil, the loss and waste rates built into the inputusage tables are not excessive. Moreover, we verified that Dongil doesnot have recoverable scrap from its production process. We also verifiedthat Dongil did not receive any duty drawback on non-physically incorporateditems. We were unable to make these determinations for Hankook since wecould not conduct a complete on-side verification of Hankook and its productionprocess. We also verified that a fixed rate duty drawback system is used by theGOK for export shipments valued at less than $20,000. The fixed rate dutydrawback is calculated yearly on a product-specific basis. The GOK determinesthe rate, on an industry-wide basis, based on the previous year's non-fixedrate duty drawback experience of a given product. The rate applicable inthe review period was 22 won per dollar of export value.Since we verified that Dongil has no recoverable scrap and that it hasnot received any duty drawback on non-physically incorporated items, wedetermine that Dongil receives no subsidy under this program.We were unable to verify, however, that Hankook did not receive drawbackon non-physically incorporated items or on recoverable scrap. Therefore,as the best information available, we assumed that the entire amount ofduty drawback received by Hankook during the review period was excessiveand therefore constitutes a countervailable subsidy.We were able to verify the amount of drawback received by Hankook on itstotal exports of the subject merchandise. However, we could not verifythe value of Hankook's total exports of the subject merchandise. Therefore,as the best information available, we used the fixed duty drawback rateof 22 won per dollar of export value to calculate the estimated net subsidy.We applied the rate of 22 won per dollar to Hankook's total exports ofthe subject merchandise to the United States as an estimate of the totalamount of duty drawback that Hankook received on its shipments of the subjectmerchandise to the United States. We then converted this won value to adollar value using, as the best information available, the highest dollar/wonexchange rate in effect during the review period. We allocated this amountover Hankook's total exports of the subject merchandise to the United States,a figure we had verified in dollars. The result of this calculation yieldsan estimated net subsidy of 2.78 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for Hankook. The country-wide rate is 0.15 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3>We also considered using as the best information available the highestestimated net subsidy found for this program in all previous Korean cases.However, the highest rate previously found for this program is smallerthan the rate calculated above. Therefore, we used the methodology detailedabove.II. Programs Determined Not To Be UsedWe determine, based on verified information, that the programs listed belowwere not used by manufacturers, producers and exporters in Korea of industrialbelts during the review period.

Export Guarantees from the KXMBIII. Programs Determined To Have Been TerminatedWe determine, based on verified information, that the progrmas listed belowwere terminated and that no benefits were conferred on producers and exportersin Korea of industrial belts during the review period. For a full descriptionof these programs see our <T3>Preliminary Determination.</T3>A.

Program Determined To Not ExistWe determine that the following program does not exist.<T3>Loans for Expansion or Construction of Manufacturing Facilities</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1:</T3> Petitioner asserts that the Department's use of a weightedaverage of interest rates from various types of financial institutionsas the benchmark for the short-term export financing program results inan underestimation of the full benefit. Specifically, petitioner statesthat, regarding commmercial banks, the Department incorrectly includedin the calculation of the benchmark the rates on sources of funds targetedby the government for particular uses. Petitioner also asserts that insofaras Dongil received short-term loans from commercial banks during the reviewperiod, it received government-directed financing. In addition, petitionercontends that targeted funds are likely to be provided to a specific enterpriseor industry and should not be considered by the Department to be appropriatebases for the benchmark rate. Petitioner also suggests that the Departmentshould adjust the benchmark calculation by excluding the commercial lendingrate and including the curb market rate, <T3>i.e.,</T3> the rate charged by private money lenders.Respondents claim that Dongil's sources of short-term export financingare commercial banks only, so the curb market should not be included inthe benchmark rate.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Petitioner's allegation that all commercial bankloans are targeted to specific enterprises or industries was first raisedin the March 13, 1989, pre-hearing brief, and is, therefore, untimely andcannot be considered for purposes of this final determination.The curb market has not been included in our calculation of the benchmarkfor the following reasons: (a) Information from verification and throughdiscussions with officials of the U.S. Treasury Department, the InternationalMonetary Fund, and the World Bank indicates that the curb market is a verymarginal source of funds in the Korean financial markets; (b) these samesources indicate that the curb market is not a viable source of financingfor any but the smallest companies; and (c) we do not have adequate informationon interest rates in the curb market.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> Respondents assert that the Department should use Dongil'scompany-specific cost of comparable short-term commercial bank financingas the short-term interest rate benchmark. Respondents argue that becauseshort-term interest rates in Korea vary greatly depending on the creditworthinessof individual borrowers, a country-wide average rate would be higher sinceit includes less creditworthy companies. Moreover, respondents maintainthat because Dongil is the only exporter of the subject merchandise andthe Department already has information concerning Dongil's cost of alternativefinancing, the calculation of a company-specific rate would not be overlyburdensome.Petitioner claims that the Department should follow its precedent and itspreference articulated in the <T3>Subsidies Appendix</T3> attached to the notice of <T3>Cold-Rolled Cabon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina: FinalAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order</T3>(49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984) and use the country-wide short-term benchmark.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> In order to administer the countervailing duty lawin an administrably manageable way, it is necessary for uniformity thatwe use a country-wide benchmark for short-term financing programs insteadof a company-specific benchmark. See, for example, <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Order: WeldedCarbon Steel Pipe and Tube Products from Argentina,</T3> (49 FR 37619,September 27, 1988).<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Respondents assert that the Department has verifiedthe actual distribution of commercial bank short-term interest rates inKorea through survey results of Korean banks submitted by the GOK at verification.They contend that the Department should ensure that the country-wide benchmarkreflects this survey. Furthermore, respondents argue that the informationwas timely since it was submitted at verification and before the Department'snew regulations took effect.Petitioner claims that to the extent that the Department may use commercialbank rates in the benchmark for the final determination, the Departmentshould maintain the rate used in the preliminary determination. Petitionerstates that the information regarding the interest rate distribution withinthe regulated band may be incomplete. Moreover, the information, whichwas not submitted until verification, was untimely.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Although we recognize that the survey results providedby the GOK may not be a precise reflection of the country-wide weighted-averageshort-term commercial bank interest rate in Korea, we have decided to usethe results as the best information available. We note that interest rateinformation provided in the survey was verified and that it is consistentwith information provided in the GOK annual reports and monthly bulletins.We find that the survey data is timely because we specifically asked therespondent for the data in our deficiency questionnaire of December 15,1988. In any event, we agree with respondents that the information wastimely since the new regulations were not in effect at the time of verification.Furthermore, our findings were in our verification report and petitionerhad adequate time to comment.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Respondents assert that the short-term interest ratebenchmark ought to be based exclusively on commercial bank lending ratesin the final determination. Respondents state that the Department useda weighted-average basket of interest rates because it determined thatthe higher rediscount ratio for short-term commercial bank export financingconferred a preference on export financing relative to domestic short-termcommercial bank financing. However, respondents assert that, as the rediscountratios for export and domestic financing were equalized before the preliminarydetermination, there is no longer an incentive to prefer export financingto domestic financing.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree with respondents that the equalizationof the rediscount ratios constitutes a program-wide change. However, itis the Department's policy to take into account only those program-widechanges which are measurable and verifiable. The equalization of the rediscountratios took place in September 1988. The interval since then representstoo short a time to measure adequately the effect of that change on thelending practices of Korean commercial banks. Moreover, we do not havethe information to allow us to calculate a commercial bank short-term interestrate based on the period since September 1988. Therefore, for the purposesof this final determination, we are not taking this change into accountbecause the effects of the change cannot be measured.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> Respondents assert that the Department should takeinto account in the final determination another program-wide change whichoccurred, with respect to the short-term export financing program, priorto the preliminary determination. Specifically, the Department should takeinto account the information submitted during verification that the GOKeffectively abolished the short-term export financing program by allowingall interest rates in the Korean economy to vary according to market forces.Petitioner claims that the Department should not take into account thechanges in the program because the effects are speculative and it is theDepartment's policy to take into account only those changes that are quantifiableand verifiable.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> It is the Department's policy to take into accountprogram-wide changes which occur prior to the preliminary determinationand are both measurable and verifiable. The effective date for the liberalizationof interest rates in the Korean economy was December 5, 1988, which wasafter the date of publication of the <T3>Preliminary Determination.</T3> Therefore, this program-wide changeoccurred too late to be taken into account.<T3>Comment 6:</T3> Respondents assert that the Department should consideras a program-wide change the reduction in the loan exchange ratios in theshort-term export financing program. According to respondents, the reductionis measurable and was verified and thus should be taken into account.Petitioner claims that the Department, by ascribing 1988 loan exchangeratios onto Dongil's export borrowing in 1987 as proposed by respondents,would be indulging in speculation. The effect of the change in the loanexchange ratios, according to petitioner, is neither quantifiable nor verifiable.Hence, no adjustment should be made for the reduction in the loan exchangeratios.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> We agree with petitioner. Although this particularchange occurred prior to our preliminary determination and we were ableto verify the change, we cannot measure the effect of the change on thebenefit provided to Dongil under the program. The review period for thisinvestigation is calendar year 1987. Consequently, we do not have verifedinformation with respect to Dongil's 1988 sales, nor its level of borrowingin 1988. Thus, any calculation performed by the Department would be toospeculative.<T3>Comment 7:</T3> Petitioner asserts that the Department erred in notfinding Dongil's long-term loans countervailable in the preliminary determination.Petitioner claims that long-term financing is regulated by the GOK throughvarious financial institutions and loans received from regulated sourcesare at interest rates below the benchmark rate and as such are on preferentialterms. Also, petitioner maintains that approximately 55 percent of commercialloans are directed loans and on this basis, as best information available,the Department should find the long-term loans of Dongil to be providedto a specific enterprise or industry.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> Petitioner first raised this argument in its pre-hearingbrief.It is untimely and cannot be considered for purposes of this final determinationbecause the argument was raised after verification and, consequently, wedo not have the information to evaluate the argument.<T3>Comment 8: </T3>Petitioner asserts that deductions from taxable incomethrough export tax reserves should be treated solely as tax savings inthe year received and not as an interest-free loan. Respondents claim thatthe export tax reserves programs are tax deferrals and the Department shouldfollow its longstanding practice of treating tax deferrals as short-terminterest-free loans. Respondents argue that the actual losses of a companyin Korea may be used to reduce ordinary income or to reduce the exporttax reserves, but not both. Thus, the tax reserves programs do not resultin tax savings, it only creates a tax deferral for a specific, limitedperiod of time.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with respondents. We find that the taxreserves programs provide a tax deferral, not tax savings. All money inthe reserves, if not used to offset losses, is eventually added back toincome and subject to tax. If used to offset losses, the reserve is reducedby the loss amount.<T3>Comment 9: </T3> Petitioner states that Dongil's effective tax rateas reported in its response includes the effects of the subsidy benefitfrom the export tax reserves programs. Therefore, use of this rate understatesDongil's tax savings resulting from their use of the export tax reservesprograms. As an alternative effective tax rate, petitioner proposes a ``national''effective tax rate for large corporations as reported in an outside source.Respondents deny that there is a national effective tax rate. Further,they claim that the Department should use company-specific effective taxrates in calculating any benefits received under the export tax reservesprograms. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We agree with petitioner that the effective taxrate used to calculate the benefit from the export tax reserves programsshould not reflect the benefit from the programs. We disagree, however,with the substitution of an unverified tax rate from an outside source.Instead, we recalculated Dongil's and Hankook's respective effective taxrates by increasing their taxable income by the amount of the reservesset aside under the export tax reserves programs and also increasing theamount of taxes that the companies would have paid absent their use ofthe tax reserves programs. <T3>Comment 10: </T3>Respondents assert that the Department must distinguishbetween ``special exports'' and ``general exports'' in the export tax reservesprograms because the amount of export income that can be contributed towardsa reserve depends on the country to which the goods have been exported.Thus, respondents claim that, for Dongil, the Department should calculateany subsidy margin by dividing the amount of Dongil's reserves attributableto U.S. exports by Dongil's total U.S. exports. Petitioner claims thatthe information segregating the tax benefit according to the destinationof the exports was provided for the first time at verification. Therefore,under the new procedural regulations, the data submitted was not timelyand should not be considered. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>The actual benefit attributable to exports to theUnited States is better measured by the amount of the reserves attributableto the United States and not to worldwide exports. Respondents were ableto segregate benefits attributable to exports to the United States at verificationand we were able to verify this information. The information provided atverification was not a major change to respondent's original submission,but rather was a clarification to their original submission. We fully describedthe information submitted by respondent in our verification report. Consequently,petitioner had adequate time to comment. Finally, we note that the newprocedural regulations were not in effect at the time of verification andtherefore, are not controlling.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>Petitioner asserts that the appropriate calculationof the rate for Hankook based on the best information available would beto divide Dongil's total drawback by Hankook's exports. Respondents claimthat the GOK supplied Hankook's total duty drawback amount on all exportsof the subject merchandise in response to the Department's questionnaires.Additionally, there are no non-physically incorporated inputs in the productionof industrial belts and Korea eliminated its practice of permitting drawbackon non-physically incorporated items. Therefore, neither Dongil nor Hankookreceived a countervailable benefit from this program. <T3>DOC Position: </T3>We verified the total amount of duty drawback receivedby Hankook on the subject merchandise. Therefore, there is no justificationfor substituting Dongil's drawback amount for Hankook's drawback amount.However, because Hankook did not respond to our questionnaires and didnot permit a complete on-site verification, as the best information available,we have assumed that Hankook's drawback amount was excessive and calculatedthe estimated net subsidy as described in Section I.C.<T3>Comment 12: </T3>Petitioner asserts that since Hankook's failure torespond to the Department's questionnaires led the Department to the useof the best information available for the preliminary determination, theDepartment should continue to use best information available for the finaldetermination. Respondents argue that information regarding Hankook's exportdata and program participation was submitted in the GOK responses and thatthe only new information submitted at verification related to the typeof belt exported. Therefore, the Department should not use best informationavailable.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Prior to our preliminary determination, we receivedincomplete information on Hankook from the GOK. Therefore, for the purposesof the preliminary determination, some of the information we used for Hankookwas the best information available. Subsequent to the preliminary determination,but prior to verification, the GOK provided Hankook's export data and additionalinformation on its program participation. At verification for the firsttime, Hankook claimed that the belts it exported to the United States werenot covered by the scope of the investigation. Since this was new informationfirst submitted at verification we did not accept this information. Moreover,discussions with the ITC product experts suggested that the belts producedby Hankook may be within the scope of the investigation.We used the verified information to compute Hankook's estimated net subsidywith respect to the short-term export financing and export tax reservesprograms. For the duty drawback program, however, we lacked verified dataon Hankook's total exports of the subject merchandise to all markets. Asbest information available, therefore, we derived an estimate of the amountof duty drawback received by Hankook on its exports of the subject merchandiseto the United States. We made this calculation as described in SectionI.C.As mentioned above, the only new information submitted at verificationrelated to the type of belt exported by Hankook. We did not use this informationfor purposes of this final determination (see <T3>DOC Position</T3> on <T3>Comment 15</T3>).<T3>Comment 13: </T3>Petitioner asserts that although Dongil did not benefitfrom the accelerated depreciation program under Article 25 of ACTRE duringthe review period, it did use the program during the review period andthe benefit was reported on its tax return filed in 1988. As such, petitionerstates, a separate duty deposit rate should be established. Respondentsclaim that there was no program-wide change before the preliminary determination;that participation in a program in one year but not in another does notconstitute a change in the program; and that changes in levels of participationby individual companies are taken into account in an administration review,not in the duty deposit rate. Therefore, respondents argue that a separateduty deposit rate should not be established.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> It is the Department's practice to provide for aseparate duty desposit rate only to take into account program-wide changeswhich occur prior to the preliminary determination and which are measurableand verifiable. We do not consider participation in a program in one year,but not in another, to constitute a program-wide change. The accelerateddepreciation provision under Article 25 was claimed by Dongil on its taxreturn filed after the review period. According to our standard practice,we use a cash-flow analysis for determining when the benefits of a countervailabletax program are received. Under this analysis, we consider the benefitfrom a tax program to be received when the tax return is filed. Therefore,we have determined that Dongil did not benefit from Article 25 during thereview period.<T3>Comment 14:</T3> Petitioner asserts that the Department's preliminaryfinding of critical circumstances should be upheld in the final determination.Petitioner states that a comparison of imports three months prior to thefiling of the petition to imports for three months after that point demonstratesthat there have been massive imports of the subject merchandise over arelatively short period of time. Respondents claim that critical circumstancesdid not exist at the time of the preliminary determination and do not existpresently. In fact, they state, Dongil's exports of the subject merchandisehave declined since 1987. Therefore, the Department should not find criticalcircumstances in this case.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> As we have found the benefits in this investigationto be <T3>de minimis</T3>, critical circumstances do not exist (see <T3>Critical Circumstances</T3> section below).<T3>Comment 15: </T3>Respondents assert that Hankook exports only hexagonalbelts used in riding lawnmowers to the United States. They state that hexagonalbelts are not covered in the description of the subject merchandise underinvestigation and in fact are expressly excluded from the scope of theinvestigation. Therefore, Hankook should be excluded from the final determination.Petitioner claims that hexagonal belts are within the scope of the investigationand are covered in the general description of the scope. Although certainbelts used in integral combustion engines are excluded from the investigation,hexagonal belts do not fall into this category. Therefore, Hankook is anexporter of subject merchandise and should be included in the final determination.<T3>Doc Position: </T3>Discussions with product experts at the ITC andinformation submitted by petitioner indicate that the belts exported byHankook are not used in the engine of the lawmower, but rather to turnthe mowing blades. Given this fact, hexagonal belts we considered as industrial,not automotive, belts. Furthermore, we note that Hankook did not permita complete verification, and did not provide until verification, the informationon the type of belt the company exports. Therefore, information regardingthe type of belt manufactured by Hankook was untimely and not verified.<T3>Comment 16: </T3>Petitioner asserts that, in its scope of investigationat the preliminary determination, the Department listed only four of the18 HTS items corresponding to the nine TSUSA numbers. Petitioner requeststhat the Department list all 18 HTS numbers in its final determination.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>The scope of this investigation has not changedsince the initiation. The petition included nine TSUSA item numbers and,at the time, four HTS sub-headings that petitioner believed would correspondto the TSUSA numbers when the HTS system would become effective. The Harmonized Tariff Schedule went into effect on January 1, 1989. Basedon a concordance between TSUSA item numbers and HTS sub-heading listedin the January 1989 ITC publication ``The Continuity of Import and ExportTrade Statistics After Implementation of the Harmonizied Commodity Descriptionand Coding System'', petitioner requested that the Department expand thefour HTS sub-headings and listed in our preliminary determination to eighteeensub-headings.We asked for comments from the interested parties in this investigationconcerning industrial belts covered by the eighteen HTS sub-headings. Wehave received no objections in this particular determination.In our preliminary determination, as now, we note that the written descriptionsof the products covered by the investigation is dispositive. The HTS numbersare provided for convenience and customs purposes as to the scope of theproduct coverage. Accordingly, we do not view this as a broadening of thescope of this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist within the meaningof section 703(e)(1) of the Act, with respect to imports of industrialbelts from Korea. In determining whether critical circumstances exist,we must examine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspectthat (1) the alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the <T3>GATT Subsidies Code</T3>, and (2) there have been massive imports ofthe subject merchandise over a relatively short period.Because we determine that the benefit provided to manufacturers, producers,or exporters of industrial belts in Korea is <T3>de minimis</T3>, the final determination is negative. Therefore, criticalcircumstances do not exist. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the informationused in making our final determination. As mentioned previously, when wecould not verify the information, we used the best information available.During verification, we followed standard verification procedures, includingmeeting with government and company officials; inspecting documents andledgers; tracing information in the response to source documents, accountingledgers, and financial statements; and collecting additional informationthat we deemed necessary for making out final determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of liquidation </ITAG>The estimated net subsidy rate for industrial belts is 0.41 percent <T3>ad valorem. </T3>Under section 355.7 of our regulations, an aggregatenet subsidy of less than 0.5 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>is considered <T3>de minimis.</T3>Since the suspension of liquidation was discontinued on April 1, 1989,120 days after our preliminary determination, there is no need to instructthe U.S. Customs Service to discontinue the suspension of liquidation.However, we are instructing the U.S. Customs Service to refund all estimatedcountervailing duties deposited on all unliquidated entries, or withdrawalsfrom warehouse, for consumption of the subject merchandise entered betweenSeptember 3, 1988, and March 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 705(d) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination. Since we have determined that only <T3>de minimis</T3> countervailing benefits are being provided to manufacturers,producer or exporters in Korea of industrial belts, this investigationwill be terminated upon the publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Hence, the ITC is not required to make a finalinjury determination.This determination is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act (19U.S.C. 1671d(d)).<ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
