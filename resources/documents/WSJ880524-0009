Envirodyne said there aren't any talks currently under way with a possible buyer but that a sale or merger of all or a majority interest are among several possibilities that Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., its investment banker, will evaluate. Envirodyne makes hot dog casings and plastic food-service products.    Artra Group Inc., a scientific instrument and supplies company that owns 26.7% of Envirodyne, said it asked that a sale be explored because proceeds would allow it to better concentrate on its own businesses.    Various restrictions make Artra's holding in Envirodyne highly illiquid, Artra said. For instance, the shares are held in a trust controlled by Envirodyne and Artra can sell only a certain number of shares each quarter.    Should a sale occur, Artra said it would give proceeds over $36 a share to other Envirodyne shareholders until those shareholders receive an average of $45 a share. Artra said the book value of its Envirodyne investment is less than $7 a share.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Envirodyne shares closed at $27.50, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
