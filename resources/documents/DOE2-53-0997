<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-0997 </DOCNO><TEXT>Several high-intensity synchrotron x-ray sources have been constructedover the past few years in the United States, West Germany, Great Britain,Japan, France, Italy, and the Soviet Union. Crystallographers have begunto use these facilities for experiments that take advantage of the characteristicsof synchrotron radiation, namely, a broad distribution of wavelengths,high intensity, low divergence, strong polarization, and a pulsed timestructure. In addition to more familiar diffraction experiments on singlecrystals and powdered samples, new types of crystallographic studies,for example, energy-dispersive and surface diffraction studies, haveprogressed rapidly with more general accessibility of synchrotron sources.These high-intensity sources allow diffraction experiments to be performedon very small crystals or on large biological molecules, and permit weakmagnetic scattering to be detected. Anomalous dispersion experimentscan exploit the ability to vary the wavelength of the radiation, andthe pulsed time structure of the beam makes possible fast time-resolvedexperiments. Because of the availability of synchrotron x-radiation,these and other kinds of experiments will be in the forefront of crystallographicresearch for the next several years.</TEXT></DOC>
