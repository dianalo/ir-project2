And the threat is growingrather than diminishing.   Perhaps the most sobering statement Bush made in calling for aninternational ban on these terrible weapons is that more than 20nations now produce them, or have the ability to do so.   For a worldwide treaty to be enforceable, it will require notonly the cooperation of major countries but also some kind ofmechanism to monitor and eliminate the use of chemical weapons bythugs like Moammar Gadhafi.   Bush's goal is highly noble, but one that will be extremelydifficult to achieve.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 23   The State, Columbia, S.C., on Hurricane Hugo:   The destruction wrought by Hurricane Hugo was described byCharleston Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. as ``unprecedented in anyone'sliving memory.'' It will take time, hard work and hundreds ofmillions of dollars before South Carolina, especially its coastalareas, can recover from the huge storm, which landed a direct hiton the historic port city and nearby barrier islands.   Gov. Carroll Campbell, Mayor Riley, state health officials,emergency preparedness personnel and thousands of National Guardtroops and law enforcement officers deserve major credit forminimizing the human toll from the hurricane.   Tragically, at least 17 lives were lost in South Carolina, butthat figure might have been much higher had it not been for theexcellent emergency planning that began long before Hugo madelandfall.   Even with federal aid, the blow to this state's economy will beheavy. Scores of historic buildings and homes were leveled in the300-year-old city of Charleston, and its barrier islands were inruins. Many Grand Strand homes were swept away. Amusement parkswere wiped out. Bridges and roads were damaged or destroyed.   At least for a while, the tourist trade, which brings in severalbillion dollars annually, is likely to fall on hard times.   Today, South Carolinians mourn those who did not make it throughthe storm and give thanks for those who did. It was bad, very bad.But it could have been worse.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 26   The Indianapolis Star on Hurricane Hugo:   Assessing fully the ravages of Hurricane Hugo may take weeks,and the total task of rebuilding may take years. ...   Countless families lost homes, businesses, all of theirpossessions and their livelihoods. Battering 20-foot waves and140-mph winds devastated the Isle of Palms and Sullivan's Islandand destroyed the only bridge connecting them to the (SouthCarolina) mainland.   Homes and other structures were smashed along a corridor ofdestruction many miles wide and hundreds of miles long.   The storm's worst-hit victims need help and need it badly. ...   The need will continue until the emergency has ended, and it isimpossible at present to predict with any certainty when that willbe, either on the islands ravaged before the hurricane swept ontothe mainland or along the arc of destruction it left as it roarednorthward.   The mayor of Charleston, Joseph P. Riley, after touring hiscity, said, ``We have on our hands a degree of physical destructionthat is unprecedented in anyone's living memory.''   But he also promised, ``We will not just rebuild. We willrestore.''   If so, the famous beauty that was Charleston will not be forevergone with the wind.   That is the spirit it will take to recover from a stunningcatastrophe.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 25   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on flag burning:   President Bush was silly to propose, in response to a SupremeCourt decision in June, a constitutional amendment to prohibit flagburning. And congressional Democrats are cowardly in pushinglegislation to accomplish the same end.   It would be tragic indeed if the legacy of Gregory L. Johnson _who triggered the case by burning the flag in a repulsive andchildish protest _ were to be the undermining of our Bill of Rights.   There are strong indications the American people understandthat. After initial public outrage over the decision, common sensehas replaced passion.   Upon calm reflection, the public has increasingly accepted thenotion that the glory of our freedoms, as symbolized by the flag,is that it protects even those who would hold it in contempt.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sept. 25   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on Barney Frank:   When Ronald Reagan was president, U.S. Rep. Barney Frank wasamong those who called for Attorney General Edwin Meese to resign.Frank has been an advocate for high ethical standards during hisnine years in Congress.   Now, influential voices are beginning to call for him to resign.So far, he has refused to quit.   The Massachusetts Democrat probably should step down _ if for noother reason than his effectiveness has diminished.   Frank ought to be judged on the propriety or impropriety of whathe did, not for being a homosexual. Frank acknowledged publicly in1987 that he was gay.   He is presently under fire for involvement with a maleprostitute who claims to have run a bisexual prostitution ring outof the congressman's apartment in Washington, D.C.   Frank does not deny that he had a relationship with StephenGobie.   In public life, Frank has condemned people such as Meese andIllinois Rep. Gus Savage, who is accused of sexually harassing aPeace Corps worker. Then, in private, Frank associates with peoplelike Gobie, who operate, at best, on the fringes of the law.   (Frank's) sexual preference is not the issue. The issue ischaracter.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
