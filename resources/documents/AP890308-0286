Fresh appleshave been pulled from school cafeteria menus because of worriesabout carcinogenic pesticides.   The Board of Education, which feeds students in 1,200 public andparochial schools under a federal program, barred the sale of appleslast month, at least until it receives advice from the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, said Kevin Gill, director of support services forthe board.   The Washington-based National Resource Defense Council hasreported that the pesticide diaminozide, which is known by its brandname Alar, could increase the incidence of cancer in children whodrink a lot of apple juice.   Apple growers contended only about 4 percent of all apples soldin the United States show any traces of Alar and those amounts arewell below EPA standards.   Alar is used to maintain firmness and resist bruising in fruitsand vegetables.   Gill's program sells or hands out about 13 million apples a year.He said students had not been complaining about the fruit'sdisappearance. ``It's only been a few weeks, and we offer a widevariety of fruits,'' he said.   Applesauce and apple juice are harder to replace and willcontinue to be served, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
