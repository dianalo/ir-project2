Shevardnadze to curtail its military bases inEurope.   ``We support that aim and are willing to work with them topreserve their security through political rather than militarymeans,'' the State Department said.   A statement issued by the press office said similar Sovietproposals in the past appeared to be aimed at the elimination ofU.S. bases on foreign soil. ``We cannot accept such an outcome,''the statement said. ``We maintain bases as part of a successfulsystem of collective defense which has assured our security andthat of our friends and allies.''   However, the State Department said, the proposal Tuesday byShevardnadze in a Moscow speech could mean the Soviets now aresearching for ways to disengage from some of their foreign militarycommitments, particularly in Europe.   Initially, the White House brushed off Shevardnadze's proposal,which vied for attention with his acknowledgement that the Sovietinvasion of Afghanistan in 1979 was a mistake and that the radarinstallation at Krasnoyarsk violated the 1972 Anti-BallisticMissile Treaty with the United States.   But the statement from the State Department, which apparentlywas cleared by high-ranking officials, signaled a U.S. willingnessto talk to the Soviets about the proposal.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is expected to go to theSoviet Union this winter for a meeting with Shevardnadze thatprobably will concentrate on preparations for a superpower summitbetween Presidents Bush and Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in Europe that ``we're alwayslooking at base structure, especially in a time of tight budgets.''And he noted that U.S. operations at Torrejon in Spain were basedphased out. At the request of the Spanish government the F-15 jetfighters stationed there are being moved to Italy.   Meanwhile, U.S. intelligence sources disclosed the Soviets weredeploying two new kinds of advanced nuclear-tipped missiles aroundMoscow as part of a vastly upgraded defense of the capital.   A sophisticated new radar system also is being deployed, thesources said Wednesday night.   When completed, the three-part upgrading program, legal underthe 1972 treaty with the United States, would defend Moscow with100 new launchers, most of them underground.   The complex network would also protect the Soviet high command,sources told The Associated Press. The Soviets already have alabyrinthian system designed to speed Soviet leaders to safety inthe event of a nuclear war.   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theSoviets had been working on an improved missile defense since 1980,but only last spring were found to have begun making the systemoperational.   New long-range missile interceptors, designed to take the placeof an earlier, less sophisticated version of the weapon known inwestern military circles as ``Galosh,'' have the mission ofstopping incoming ballistic missiles above the atmosphere.   A shorter-range, extremely fast missile known as ``Gazelle'' isbeing deployed as a complementary defensive missile designed tocatch missile warheads in the atmosphere that might have gotten bythe ``Galosh.''   Gazelle is supposed to be able to discriminate between decoysand the real thing.   The new radar at Pushkino, about 25 miles northeast of Moscow,was described as ``considerably advanced'' and able to tracktargets anywhere in its 360-degree field of vision.   First word of the new Soviet deployments came in a report on theCable News Network.   The 1972 treaty limits U.S. and Soviet defenses on the basis ofthe then-dominant theory that a potential attacker might bedeterred from striking if massive retaliation was the likelyresponse. A defense against retaliation might lead the possessor ofsuch a defense to the conclusion that he could strike in safety,according to that theory.   However, the treaty was amended to permit the two countries toprotect their capitals and one other target, and then was amendedagain to permit the defense of one place in each country.   The Soviets chose to shield Moscow while the United Statesinstalled a ``Safeguard'' system to protect Minuteman missiles nearGrand Forks, N.D. The North Dakota system was dismantled shortlyafter it was finished in 1975 and none has been built since.</TEXT></DOC>
