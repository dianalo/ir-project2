The purpose of the Navy'sMobility Fuels Technology Program is to understand fuel supply and fuelproperty impacts on Navy equipment performance and fleet readiness andoperations. Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) has assisted the Departmentof Navy in developing and testing a methodology for forecasting mobilityfuel availability, quality, and relative price, as well as evaluatingoptions to increase fuel supplies during world oil supply disruptions.Publicly available models developed by the Energy Information Administrationof the Department of Energy were selected as the foundation of the NavyMobility Fuels Forecasting System (NMFFS). The NMFFS was enhanced asORNL reviewed data on world oil reserves, production and prices, trendsin crude oil and refined product quality, and changes in refinery processtechnology. The system was used to analyze the availability, quality,and relative price of military fuels that could be produced in severaldomestic and foreign refining regions under Business-As-Usual (BAU) andtwo hypothetical world crude oil disruption scenarios in the year 1995.25 refs., 11 figs., 29 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
