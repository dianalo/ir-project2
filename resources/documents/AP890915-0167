John H. Kelly, the assistant secretary of state for the NearEast, said that ``change in tactics'' could contribute to efforts toarrange negotiations between the Arabs and Israel.   ``Every year around this time the question comes up for a vote,''Kelly said in a speech prepared for a conference on the Middle Eastat the Wye Plantation in Maryland.   ``It is time for the Arab nations to follow the example of thePLO and acknowledge Israel's existence as a state. Israel isentitled to membership in the United Nations under the principle ofuniversality,'' Kelly said.   The U.S. official referred to the step taken last year byPalestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat, who alsopublicly renounced terrorism. That action met U.S. conditions forthe dialogue opened by the United States with the PLO last December.   ``It is time for the Arab governments to stop the anachronisticpractice of voting against Israeli credentials,'' Kelly said.   The Arabs have consistently failed to oust Israel from the UnitedNations but the move provides an annual opportunity to condemn theJewish state before a large audience. Arab delegates also habituallywalk out when Israel's representative speaks to the U.N. GeneralAssembly.   Kelly denied U.S. peace efforts were at a dead end.   ``There is potential for movement,'' he said, adding that atimetable for face-to-face negotiations should be set byPalestinians and Israel _ not the Bush administration.</TEXT></DOC>
