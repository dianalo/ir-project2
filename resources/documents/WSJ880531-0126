The legislation was passed by a voice vote after Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R., N.Y.) agreed to withdraw an amendment that would have authorized the death penalty for drug dealers who are convicted of murder. The measure must be reconciled with a version passed by the House earlier this month.    Mr. D'Amato's insistence on his amendment had held up the bill's passage for nearly two weeks. He relented when Senate leaders agreed to consider the amendment as separate legislation on June 8.    In an election-year demonstration of determination to combat drugs, senators voted overwhelmingly to make drug interdiction an official mission for U.S. armed forces. The measure would, among other things, give arrest powers to Navy officers aboard warships that stop suspected drug smugglers on the high seas.    The House bill contains a vaguer call for military involvement in fighting drugs.    Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly against an attempt to turn aside Mr. D'Amato's death-penalty amendment. But opponents of capital punishment threatened to block the entire defense bill if Mr. D'Amato's provision were included. In addition, inclusion of the amendment, which isn't in the House version, probably would have led to a long and contentious House-Senate conference.    The defense bill would authorize spending for Pentagon operations, weapons procurement, and military research and development. It also includes a provision aimed at overcoming political opposition to closing unnecessary military bases, by establishing a 15-member Pentagon commission to recommend which installations should be shut.    Though the House bill doesn't contain a similar provision, a separate bill to establish a base-closing commission is pending there.    The House and Senate will have to iron out significant differences in the level of spending they would provide to a number of major defense programs, including the MX missile, the single-warhead Midgetman missile and the anti-missile defense-research program known as the Strategic Defense Initiative. </TEXT></DOC>
