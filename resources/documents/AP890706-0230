The International Energy Agency said Wednesday in its Monthly OilMarket Report that the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries pumped about 21.3 million barrels of crude a day lastmonth, up 200,000 barrels a day from May.   The rise lifted second-quarter production to about 21 millionbarrels a day, topping OPEC's self-imposed 18.5 million-barrel dailyproduction limit. It also was the highest for the April-June periodsince the 23.2 million barrels a day produced in that quarter of1981.   The OPEC nations last month set their production ceiling at 19.5million barrels a day for the last six months of the year _ up 1million barrels from the first-half quota _ in an attempt to supportan $18 benchmark price for a ``basket'' of Middle Eastern crude oil.The basket price is a composite of seven different crudes.   OPEC's argument is that by giving member countries higher quotas,they will be less likely to cheat and exceed the limits.   The ministers agreed to divide up the extra sales proportionatelyamong all members, angering Kuwait and others that wanted a biggershare of the increase. Kuwait has stated it would not be bound byits individual quota.   The energy agency _ a body of the multi-nation Organization ofEconomic Cooperation and Development _ predicted demand for OPEC oilwould be about 20.9 million barrels a day in the second half of theyear, about the same as the May forecast.   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch CapitalMarkets in New York, predicted OPEC in July would produce 20.5million to 21 million barrels a day.   He said oil stocks already were high and demand was likely toslow, which could keep prices under downward pressure.   The average price for a basket of seven crudes monitored by OPECwas $17.62 a barrel at the end of June, sharply up from $12.34 atthe end of November.   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkU.S. crude, closed at $20.79 a barrel Wednesday on the New YorkMercantile Exchange, up 52 cents from Friday's close. The market wasclosed Monday and Tuesday for the Independence Day holiday.   OPEC has said data from nearly all its members shows theygenerally are adhering to their targets. The organization measures anation's quota by figuring crude production and the amount of oilput into, or drawn out, of stocks.   The energy agency estimated Saudi Arabia, the world's No. 1 crudeexporter, produced 4.8 million barrels a day in June, compared withits OPEC quota of 4.5 million barrels a day.   ``The major increase was in Iran, which was up 300,000 barrels aday (from May) to 2.8 million barrels a day (in June),'' the reportstated.   Iraq, like Iran, pumped about 2.8 million barrels a day, comparedwith a quota of 2.64 million barrels.   Kuwait produced an estimated 1.6 million barrels a day and theUnited Arab Emirates 1.7 million barrels, compared with theirtargets of about 1 million barrels a day.   Nigeria produced an estimated 1.6 million barrels a day;Venezuela, 1.7 million barrels; Ecuador, 300,000 barrels; Indonesia,1.2 million barrels; Algeria, 700,000 barrels; Gabon, 200,000barrels, and Libya, 1 million barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
