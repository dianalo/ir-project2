WELCH</HEAD><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Members of the Congressional Black CaucusFriday accused Sen. Orrin Hatch of violating ``constitutional andcivil rights'' in his complaint to the Justice Department aboutactivities of the lobbying group TransAfrica.   But Hatch, R-Utah, immediately backed down from his complaintand disassociated himself from it.   His press secretary, Paul Smith, quoted Hatch as saying, ``Icalled the attorney general and asked him to ignore the letter. Itwas overzealousness on the part of my office.''   Hatch had written Attorney General Dick Thornburgh on Mondayasking that he investigate the efforts of TransAfrica and itspresident, Randall Robinson, in support of Angolan PresidentEduardo dos Santos and his Soviet-backed government.   Hatch charged in the letter that Robinson was receivingfinancing from the Angolan and Cuban governments and was working tochange U.S. policy ``in direct coordination with the Marxist regimein Angola.''   ``It appears that these activities may be a direct violation ofthe Foreign Agent Registration Act,'' Hatch wrote, referring to thefederal law requiring agents of foreign nations in the UnitedStates to register with the government.   ``I would like to request that you personally look into thismatter,'' Hatch wrote. ``Mr. Robinson is actively working againstthe foreign policy interest of the United States, and I believethis is a matter that deserves the attention of the Department ofJustice.''   A spokesman for Thornburgh, Dan Eramian, said the department hasreceived Hatch's letter. ``It's under review,'' he said.   Robinson denied Hatch's claims that the Angolan and Cubangovernments finance his group and that a trip last week byTransAfrica officials to the Angolan capital of Luanda was paid forby Angola.   In an interview, he called Hatch's letter ``an outrage'' and``an attempt to intimidate me.'' He said, ``Joseph McCarthy isalive and well in Utah.''   The Black Caucus prepared a letter Friday voicing ``profoundconcern'' to Thornburgh over Hatch's request. The letter was signedby Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., chairman of the group. Signatures ofother black members of Congress were being collected before theletter was sent.   In the letter, the congressmen refer to Hatch's letter as anattempt ``to curb and restrict the constitutional rights'' ofTransAfrica.   ``We wish to place on the record our serious concerns regardingthe violation of constitutional and civil rights reflected inSenator Hatch's letter to you,'' they wrote.   TransAfrica is a lobbying group concerned with U.S. policytoward Africa and the Caribbean, and was a leader in pushing fortougher U.S. sanctions against South Africa. It has worked to alterofficial U.S. opposition to the Angolan government and opposes theU.S. support for Jonas Savimbi, chief of the Angolan rebel groupUNITA.   Savimbi met with President Bush on Thursday.   UNITA is one of the largest recipients of covert U.S. militaryaid, estimated by some observers at more than $40 million annually.Transafrica estimates the aid at twice that amount.   Continuing support for Savimbi has become a focus of some U.S.conservatives, including Hatch.   Robinson said the only money the group has received from Angolaand Cuba were the purchases of tickets to the group's annualfundraising dinner, at $2,000 per table. He said representatives of50 countries bought tickets, but the group otherwise accepts nomoney from foreign governments.</TEXT></DOC>
