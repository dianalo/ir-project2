 The Pivot, the newestaddition to Radius Inc.'s line of displays, does just that, allowing users topivot the screen orientation from portrait (vertical) to landscape(horizontal).andM;Similar in many respects to its predecessor, Radius' Full Page Display, thePivot has a resolution of 640 by 864 pixels or vice versa and supportsmonochrome or four shades of gray, which can be upgraded to 16 shades.andP;  Pivotinterface boards are available for the Mac SE/30 and the Mac II family; ourtests were run on the SE/30.andP;  Radius Full Page Display interfaces for the MacPlus, SE, SE/30 and Mac II family will drive the Pivot monitor, but only inportrait orientation.andM;Getting your act together.andP;  Installing the Pivot graphics card in any Mac IIis a straightforward task, but Radius requires that an Apple certifiedtechnician install the board in the SE/30.andP;  The design of the board for theSE/30 is clean; it takes up no more room than necessary and has convenientplastic push-on fasteners that help hold the board in place in case of roughhandling.andP;  Radius even provides spare screws and fasteners, anticipatingbounce-under-the-file-cabinet situations.andM;We had to bend one capacitor slightly to allow the board to slide past theSE/30's chassis, and the metal plate supplied to cover the DB-15 videoconnector on the back didn't fit.andP;  But otherwise, installation was a snap.andM;Software installation.andP;  The Pivot comes with Pivot Display, a Control Paneldevice (cdev) that redraws the screen automatically when you change themonitor's orientation.andP;  The software also enables optional tear-off andenlarged menus, a screen saver and a replacement for the Command-Shift-3screen-capture command.andM;The installer that copies the Pivot Display file into the System folderworked well, but the process can take more than a minute, and the softwareneglects to tell you what it is doing; we thought the machine might havecrashed.andM;Two Pivot-specific software features, Dynamic Desktop and Finder Cleanup, areworthy of special mention.andP;  After you change orientations, Finder Cleanupautomatically moves any desktop icons that would be lost off-screen to theupper-right-hand portion of the display.andP;  The Trash is relocated from itsusual hangout at the lower-right-hand corner of the screen to a pointdirectly below the disk icons.andP;  This takes a little getting used to.andP;  DynamicDesktop is the essential software that allows you to change the position ofthe Pivot in real time, redrawing your screen to match the new orientation ofyour monitor.andP;  With Dynamic Desktop turned off, you can rotate the screen toany angle from 0 degrees to 90 degrees without redrawing.andM;The user and software manuals are clear, with good diagrams and examplescreens.andP;  Since a rotating screen is a new concept, Radius includes asoftware-compatibility guide with hints and tips for using popular Macapplications with the display.andM;Doin' the twist.andP;  The real eye-opener is when you actually flip the Pivot.andO;The monitor has a built-in mercury switch that senses when the screen isrotated.andP;  According to Radius, weights inside the display help balance theunit and provide for smooth motion during re-orientation.andP;  When the monitoris rotated to an angle of 45 degrees or more, the screen fades to black andthe pixels are quickly redrawn in the new orientation.andP;  No manual softwarecontrols, hardware switches or anything else is necessary -- the Pivot worksautomatically.andM;The Pivot's 69-Hz refresh rate (compared with 75 Hz for Apple's MacintoshPortrait Display) showed no sign of flicker, even under fluorescent lights.andO;However, we did notice some interference on the SE/30 screen when the Pivotwas in landscape mode.andP;  Radius recommends separating the units by at least 6inches, but ours showed slight interference up to 10 inches away on eitherside of the Mac.andM;The pixel density of 78 dpi is comparable to Apple's 80-dpi Portrait Display.andO;Icons and 12-point type are smaller than normal but not too small to read.andO;The Pivot screen had a slightly green tint compared with our SE/30 screen.andO;Two monitors rarely look exactly the same, and corners are especially hard tofocus because of the curvature of most picture tubes.andP;  Our Pivot had slightlyfuzzy corners, but the rest of the picture was crisp and clear.andP;  While Radiushas a reputation for quality displays, always check any monitor's focus atyour dealer before you buy.andM;Like its older sibling, the Radius Full Page Display, the Pivot allowsconcurrent use of the built-in Macintosh screen when installed on an SE/30.andO;This is handy because you can use the extra screen space for tear-off menusor tool palettes.andP;  Another noteworthy feature is the switched power port onthe back of the monitor that lets SE/30 owners turn on their Macs andmonitors from one switch.andM;All cables radiate from the center of the rear of the monitor, making it easyto pivot the display without tangling the cords.andP;  The Pivot has apower-indicator light, a new feature on Ra-dius full-page displays.andP;  Radiussaid the Pivot was designed to allow maximum cooling and magnetic shieldingin both orientations.andM;Software shuffle.andP;  Before the Pivot, Mac applications could assume that theyhad a stable, non-dynamic piece of screen real estate to work with.andP;  Theynever had to anticipate the desktop literally being pulled out from underthem.andP;  Dynamic Desktop doesn't relocate windows when you change the Pivot'sorientation, so they may need to be rearranged before pivoting to preventthem from being lost in an area of desktop that can't be accessed.andM;Radius recommends launching applications in the orientation in which you planto use them.andP;  Some applications continue to open documents in the orientationin which they were launched, so future versions will need to be madePivot-aware.andP;  The screen will not be redrawn when you rotate the display ifan alert or dialog box is on-screen, Dynamic Desktop is turned off, the mouseis down, or if HyperCard or some other application has hidden the menu bar.andM;Conclusions.andP;  The Radius Pivot is a great idea that's been implemented well.andO;Compared with Apple's Portrait Display and graphics card at nearly the sameprice, the Pivot's a good value.andP;  Radius deserves applause for its work inindustrial and software design that makes the Pivot easy and painless to use.andO;A dual-orientation monitor has advantages for almost any well-behavedapplication, and a full-page, flicker-free display is a big improvement overthe Mac 9-inch screen.andM;Radius Inc. is located at 1710 Fortune Drive, San Jose, Calif.andP;
