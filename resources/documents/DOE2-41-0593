Fifteen glass and wasteform compositions and theirproposed package materials, supplied by seven countries, are interredin salt at the Waste Isolation Pilot (WIPP) in Carlsbad, New Mexico.A joint effort between Sandia National Laboratories and Savannah RiverLaboratory, MIIT is the largest and most internationally cooperativein situ venture yet undertaken. The objective of the current study isto document the wasteform compositions used in the MIIT program and thento examine compositional correlations based on structural considerations,bonding energies, and surface-layer formation. These correlations showimportant similarities between the many different waste glass compositionsstudied worldwide and suggest that these glasses would be expected toperform well and in a similar manner. The compositional correlationsdefine a commonality between all MIIT wasteforms and assist in furtheringour understanding of high-level waste glass performance. 16 refs., 12figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
