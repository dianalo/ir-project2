(AP)  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A tentative agreement that would immediately close two dumps has been reached in a legal battle over the regulation and disposal of hazardous waste from the Savannah River nuclear weapons plant.    The plant produces plutonium and tritium for nuclear weapons.    Under the agreement, the U.S. Energy Department must close two major hazardous-waste dumps at the government plant and begin developing detailed plans for closing and monitoring three others.    The department also agreed the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control should have an active role in regulating hazardous-waste facilities at the Savannah River plant, a concession the state had sought for years.    The agreement, submitted for approval this week to U.S. District Judge Charles E. Simons Jr., was signed by the federal and state agencies and a coalition of environmental groups that had sued in 1985 over the handling of hazardous waste at the plant.    James Chandler, a lawyer for the environmental groups, said the agreement will lead to a cleaner environment at the facility and make the Savannah River plant more accountable to state and federal laws. </TEXT></DOC>
