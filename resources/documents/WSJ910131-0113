The fact that talks have intensified at this eleventh hourindicates that a strike may be averted with a tentativeagreement. Neither the union nor the nation's largeststeelmaker would give details of negotiations. The contractexpires at 12:01 a.m. EST tomorrow.</LP><TEXT>   Should a strike occur, USX won't be hurt immediately, asindustrywide steel orders are soft and the Pittsburgh companyhas built up about a month's supply of inventory. For theunion, a strike could pose greater problems, both in lostwages and potentially lost jobs. For both sides, it wouldalso stir up bitter management-labor feelings lingering fromthe six-month strike of 1986.   Any agreement will involve significant compromise onfundamental issues. Should the union give USX more favorablewage terms than the company's competitors, the competitorswould undoubtedly demand new and equitable contracts. Thatwould doom the union's so-called pattern contract, which wasreached in tough negotiations with other steelmakers over thepast two years as part of a steelworker crusade to put theindustry on a &quot;level playing field.&quot;   Michael Locker, president of the labor consulting firmLocker Associates, said the union essentially promised othersteelmakers that the pattern contract would createindustrywide labor cost parity. If the union caves into USX,&quot;it loses a tremendous amount of credibility and integritywith other steelmakers.&quot;   USX has much at stake as well. The company has repeatedlydenounced the pattern contract as too rich. Accepting it nowwould miff investors, and might scare off potential buyers.But strikes don't sit well with investors either, and USXneeds all the investor backing it can muster in theforthcoming showdown with investor Carl Icahn. Mr. Icahn, whoowns 13.3% of USX and wants the company to separate its steeland oil businesses, has threatened a proxy battle for controlof the company's board.   &quot;Anything viewed as negative, like a strike, makesinvestors unhappy with management,&quot; said Charles Bradford, ananalyst with UBS Securities Inc. Adds, John Jacobson, withAUS Consultants: &quot;I'd have to think a settlement of a laborcontract would be a positive in selling steel assets.&quot;   The union and the company had been miles apart on basicwages and benefits. While the company had agreed to restorewages to 1982 levels, representing about $1 an hour, it hassteadfastly refused any wage increase for the life of thecontract, as contained in the pattern contract. Moreover, USXhas refused the pattern contract's cost-of-living increasesand additional health benefits. The union agreed tosignificant concessions in the 1980s that in effect reducedwages.   There may be some room for bargaining, though, should thecompany offer stock, in lieu of cash, or put in escrow partof a wage increase while it conducts feasibility studies ofvarious plants.   Another thorny issue is job and pension benefit securityshould the steel assets be sold. That issue took center stagein negotiations after USX announced last fall that its steeloperations would become a separate subsidiary, thus makingthose operations easier to sell.   USX has said a steel subsidiary would have to meet its ownpension and benefit obligations, according to unionofficials. In addition, the new steel company would be freeto &quot;joint venture&quot; the plant out from under the mastercontract.   But this issue is more fluid than straight wages andbenefits. &quot;My understanding is that we have received someguarantees and some better language,&quot; says Don Thomas,president of Local 1219. &quot;But there were still someloopholes.&quot;   However, one executive at a foreign steelmaker said anyhint of job security could turn off potential buyers.&quot;Foreign concerns aren't going to be interested,&quot; if USXcaves in on job security guarantees, he said.   If USX had to weather a strike, now is the time, analystssaid. Steel demand and prices are both low, with littleprospect for a near-term upturn. And with the high price ofcrude oil, USX's Marathon operations could sustain astrikebound steel division.   Meanwhile, both sides have prepared for the worst. Theunion has assembled strike directors and pledges from unionmembers at other steelmakers to collect money at plant gatesand boycott Marathon Oil products and stores. For its part,the company has assembled refrigerated trucks of food,trailers to house outside contractors, and installed gamerooms with Ping-Pong tables at some of its plants.</TEXT></DOC>
