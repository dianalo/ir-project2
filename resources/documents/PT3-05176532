The threads have a      predetermined thread profile including root radii substantially      corresponding to a desired thread standard and crest radii which are      smaller than the root radii. The crests of the threads are deformable      after molding to enable the mold core forming the threads to be stripped      from the receptacle in a direction substantially perpendicular to the      major axis of the threads to provide crests which are deformed from their      original molded shape yet dimensioned to fall within the desired thread      standard. The receptacle is utilized as a threaded socket having one or      more electrical contact members. The socket includes a housing which can      be formed as stated above including an interior side wall having the      threads, a first closed end, a second open end and a first aperture formed      through a portion of the housing. A first substantially flat electrical      contact member extends through the first aperture and includes a first      portion extending outwardly away from an exterior surface of the socket      and a second portion extending onto the interior of the socket. The first      contact member is fixed to the socket by manipulation of the first contact      member with respect to the socket and provides resilient engagement      between the first portion of the first contact member and an article to be      threadingly inserted within the socket. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  1. Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates generally to threaded receptacles, and more      particularly to a threaded electrical socket for a light bulb and a method      of making the socket which includes non-binding threads and electrical      contacts which readily can be connected to the socket without any      additional fasteners and maintain continuity between the electrical      contacts and the light bulb during vibration or extreme tolerance      conditions between the light bulb threads and the socket threads to      eliminate intermittent contact therebetween. </PAR><PAR>  2. Description of the Related Art </PAR><PAR>  Light bulb sockets or fixtures typically are cylindrical in shape, closed      at one end, open at an opposite end and threaded on their interior wall      surfaces to accept the threads of the light bulb. Two electrical contacts      are secured in the inside of such sockets so that one contact engages with      the base or bottom of the light bulb inserted in the socket and the other      contact engages the side wall of the base of the light bulb. The      electrical contacts typically are connected to the socket by fasteners,      such as screws, and the sockets usually are made in more than one piece to      enable easy molding of the sockets and assist in assembling the contacts      within the socket. </PAR><PAR>  These existing light bulb sockets typically are made from a non-conductive      material, such as plastic, and can be utilized in a variety of lighting      situations including appliances such as refrigerators, stoves and similar      articles. An example of such a socket is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,783,435      which is assigned to the assignee of the present application. </PAR><PAR>  That patent discloses a molded plastic light bulb accommodating housing      formed of two symmetrical halves having electrical terminal members      projecting therethrough, one for contacting the light bulb base and the      other for contacting the base periphery. The electrical terminals are      placed in position within one of the two symmetrical halves which then are      welded together. The exterior surface of the housing includes engagement      members for mounting the socket to a panel, such as a panel which forms      the inner lining for a refrigerator. The socket is designed so that when      mounted in an aperture of a panel, the axis of the socket will be      positioned at a predetermined angle with respect to the plane of the      panel. </PAR><PAR>  Due to the large number of parts, these light bulb sockets and contacts are      difficult to assemble, especially when small contacts and corresponding      fasteners or fastening methods are utilized. Additionally, it is difficult      to position such contacts within the socket to maintain continuity between      the electrical contacts and the light bulb. </PAR><PAR>  These assembly and positioning problems are even more pronounced when a      socket is molded in one-piece. Typically, to mold a one-piece socket, the      mold core and corresponding machinery used to form the interior of the      socket and the interior threads are of a complex, expensive design which      usually include either a collapsible mold core or a mold core which is      unscrewed from the socket as it is removed after molding. These complex      mold cores are necessary to provide interior screw threads that      substantially match a desired thread standard corresponding to the threads      on the light bulb. </PAR><PAR>  An easier and less expensive way to form a one-piece socket is with a      simple non-collapsible mold core having exterior threads which form the      desired threads on the socket interior. Such a mold core merely is pulled      out or stripped from the socket after molding. As the mold core is pulled      out, however, the crests of the threads on the interior of the socket      become deformed as the crests on the threads of the mold core are passed      thereover. Typically, this deformation leaves the interior socket threads      with a thread profile that is outside the thread profile of the desired      thread standard. As a result, when a light bulb or thread testing gauge      later is threadingly inserted into the socket, the threads do not properly      match and binding occurs between the socket and bulb or gauge threads. </PAR><PAR>  It therefore is desirable to provide an electrical socket having threads      and electrical contacts which readily can be connected to the socket      without any additional fasteners and which maintain continuity between the      contacts and the light bulb, especially during vibration or extreme      tolerance conditions between the socket threads and the bulb threads, to      eliminate intermittent contact therebetween. </PAR><PAR>  It also would be desirable to provide a one-piece molded socket formed with      a simple mold core which merely can be pulled out of the socket after      molding and provides the socket threads with a thread profile which      closely matches the desired standard for proper threaded bulb engagement      while eliminating any thread binding. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The invention provides a molded receptacle including an interior wall      surface and screw threads formed on the interior wall surface by a mold      core. The threads have a predetermined thread profile including root radii      substantially corresponding to a desired thread standard and crest radii      which are smaller than the root radii. The crests of the threads are      deformable after molding to enable the mold core forming the threads to be      stripped from the receptacle in a direction substantially perpendicular to      the major axis of the threads to provide crests which are deformed from      their original molded shape yet dimensioned to fall within the desired      thread standard. </PAR><PAR>  The receptacle is utilized as a threaded socket having one or more      electrical contact members. The socket includes a housing which can be      formed as stated above including an interior side wall having the threads,      a first closed end, a second open end and a first aperture formed through      a portion of the housing. A first substantially flat electrical contact      member extends through the first aperture and includes a first portion      extending outwardly away from an exterior surface of the socket housing      and a second portion extending onto the interior of the socket housing.      The first contact member is fixed to the socket housing by manipulation of      the first contact member with respect to the socket housing and provides      resilient engagement between the second portion of the first contact      member and an article to be threadingly inserted within the socket      housing. </PAR><PAR>  The socket housing also can include a second aperture which accepts a      second substantially flat electrical contact member having first and      second portions similar to the first electrical contact member as well as      a resilient leg for retaining the second contact within the socket housing      and biasing the second contact toward the second open end of the socket      housing. Both the first and second contact members are inserted from the      exterior of the socket housing either through the side wall or the first      closed end of the socket housing and can include apertures to locate      bending thereof and barbs to restrict the amount of insertion. </PAR><PAR>  The socket housing can be connected to a panel, such as a panel of an      appliance, and can be positioned with the central axis of the socket      housing at a desired angle with respect to the plane of the panel. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a front partial perspective view of an embodiment of the light      socket device of the invention with a portion of the light socket housing      broken away to illustrate the light socket interior and electrical      contacts; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a longitudinal sectional view of the light socket device taken      along the line 2--2 of FIG. 1 in the direction indicated generally,      illustrating the light socket device connected to a panel and positioning      of the two electrical contacts through the side wall of the light socket      housing; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an enlarged view of a portion of the light socket of FIG. 2      illustrating bending of one of the electrical contacts with respect to the      side wall of the light socket housing; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3a is an enlarged front elevational view of the electrical contact of      FIG. 3; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a partial perspective view of another embodiment of the light      socket device of the invention with a portion of the light socket housing      broken away to illustrate the light socket interior and electrical      contacts; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a longitudinal sectional view of the light socket device taken      along the line 5--5 of FIG. 4 in the direction indicated generally,      illustrating the light socket device connected to a panel and positioning      of the two electrical contacts through the bottom of the light socket      housing; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is an enlarged elevational view of the interior bottom surface of      the light socket device of FIG. 4 illustrating the bottom electrical      contact in detail; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is an enlarged sectional view of the bottom electrical contact      within the light socket taken along the line 7--7 of FIG. 6 in the      direction indicated generally; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is an enlarged perspective view of the bottom electrical contact of      FIG. 7; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a portion of the side wall of      a light socket and the corresponding mold core utilized to form the      internal threads on the light socket illustrating the thread profile of      the invention; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is an enlarged cross-sectional view, similar to FIG. 9,      illustrating the mold core being pulled out of the light socket after      molding and deformation of the crests on the light socket threads; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is an enlarged cross-sectional view of a portion of the side wall      of the light socket and a thread test gauge illustrating the deformed      thread profile of the invention within the thread profile of the test      gauge. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  Referring to FIGS. 1 and 2, the light socket device of the invention is      designated generally by the reference numeral 10. The light socket 10      preferably only includes three separate parts: a socket housing 12; a top      electrical contact member 14 and a bottom electrical contact member 16. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 2 illustrates, the socket housing 12 generally is cylindrical in      shape having a first top open end 18 and a second bottom end 20 closed      with a bottom wall 22. The socket housing 12 can be utilized in      conjunction with a panel 24, such as a panel forming the wall of an      appliance or the like. The panel 24 includes an aperture 26 through which      a portion of the socket housing 12 is inserted. </PAR><PAR>  The socket housing 12 is designed so that when it is inserted into the      aperture 26 of the panel 24, the central axis of the socket housing 12 is      positioned at a predetermined angle with respect to the plane of the panel      24. Preferably, the socket housing 12 is designed so that its central axis      forms an angle of approximately thirty degrees with respect to the plane      of the panel 24, but can vary. </PAR><PAR>  To connect the socket housing 12 to the panel 24, the socket housing 12      preferably includes a flange 28 formed about its exterior and at a thirty      degree angle with respect to the central axis of the socket housing 12 to      overlie the aperture 26 of the panel 24 and provide the desired thirty      degree angle with respect to the panel 24. To locate and secure the socket      housing 12 to the panel 24, a back side 30 of the flange 28 includes a      locating leg member 32 on one end of the flange 28 adapted to interlock      with the margin of the aperture 26 and a resilient engagement prong member      34 on an opposite end of the flange 28. If desired, the back side 30 of      the flange 28 can include one or more additional locator legs (not      illustrated) to assist in alignment of the socket housing 12 within the      aperture 26 of the panel 24. </PAR><PAR>  Briefly, to install the socket housing 12 to the panel 24, the leg member      32 is inserted within the aperture 26 against the margin of the aperture      26 of the panel 24 and the socket housing 12 is rotated from right to left      with respect to FIG. 2. Continued rotation enables the resilient      engagement prong member 34 to flexibly seat within the aperture 26 against      the panel 24 and retain the socket housing 12 therein as FIG. 2      illustrates. This particular design of the socket housing 12 enables      installation from one side of the panel 24 without the need to access the      back side of the panel 24 or provide any additional fasteners. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be understood that the socket housing 12 can be utilized with or      without a panel 24 and corresponding aperture 26. Additionally, the      particular connection of the socket housing 12 to the panel 24 can vary      without departing from the teachings of the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  The socket housing 12 preferably is a one-piece plastic housing formed by      injection molding as will be described in detail below. To form the inside      of the socket, a noncollapsible mold core 36, illustrated in FIG. 9, is      utilized. To assist in removing the mold core 36, the second bottom end 20      of the socket housing 12 is tapered on an inside surface 38 and the first      top open end 18 includes an outward flared surface 40. The flared surface      40 also assists in insertion and seating of a light bulb (not illustrated)      within the interior of the socket housing 12. </PAR><PAR>  To threadingly engage the light bulb within the socket housing 12, an      interior wall surface 42 of the socket housing 12 includes threads 44      formed thereon. The threads 44 are specifically designed and dimensioned      so that the mold core 36 can be utilized and readily pulled out of the      socket housing 12 after molding without causing the threads 44 to bind      when the light bulb or a thread testing gauge 35 later is threadingly      inserted within the socket housing 12. The specific details of the threads      44 will be discussed below with regard to FIGS. 9-11. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 2 illustrates, the socket housing 12 includes a side wall 46 having      a first top aperture 48 and a second bottom aperture 50 formed      therethrough. The apertures 48 and 50 preferably are slotted apertures and      accept the flat top and bottom electrical contact members 14 and 16,      respectively. To assist in insertion of the contact members 14 and 16, the      side wall 46 is formed with sleeves 46a about the apertures 48 and 50      which include flared openings 46b. </PAR><PAR>  The top electrical contact member 14 is illustrated in detail in FIG. 3a      and is utilized for engagement with a side surface of the light bulb base      and provides the desired electrical contact between the contact member 14      and the light bulb base. Preferably, the contact member 14 is made from a      conductive metal to provide the desired electrical conduction as well as a      resilient spring force against the light bulb base, which typically is      tapered. The material and shape of the contact member 14, as well as the      contact member 16, can vary so long as the contacts 14 and 16 function a      described herein. </PAR><PAR>  To engage the light bulb base, the contact member 14, when in its final      assembled position illustrated in FIGS. 1-3, extends a predetermined      distance into the interior of the socket housing 12 and is bent to a      predetermined position toward the bottom wall 22 of the socket housing 12      to form a desired angle with respect to the internal wall surface 42. This      provides resilient engagement with the side surface of the light bulb base      when threaded therein, which in turn assists in proper engagement of the      light bulb base threads with the threads 44 and eliminates intermittent      contact between the contact 14 and the light bulb base. This is      particularly important during extreme temperature conditions and vibration      of the appliance or similar article utilized with the light socket 10 and      during extreme tolerance conditions between the threads 44 and the light      bulb threads. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 3a illustrates, the contact member 14 is a substantially flat,      elongate member having a first outside end 52, which remains on the      outside of the socket housing 12, and a second inside end 54, which      remains on the inside of the socket housing 12, after assembly. To assist      in engagement and alignment of the contact member 14 within the aperture      48 and resist removal of the contact member 14, each longitudinal side of      the contact member 14 includes one or more barbs 56. To further assist in      securing the contact member 14 within the aperture 48 and provide a stop      against further insertion of the contact member 14, an enlarged barb 58 is      formed on either longitudinal side of the contact member 14. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 2 illustrates, preferably, both ends 52 and 54 of the contact      member 14 are bent downward after insertion in the aperture 48 toward the      bottom wall 22 of the socket housing 12. In order to assist in precisely      locating the bend for each end 52 and 54, the contact member 14 includes      first and second apertures 60 and 62 for bending the first end 52 and the      second end 54, respectively, of the contact member 14. The apertures 60      and 62 enable easy bending only at these points and prevent deforming the      remaining flat portions of the contact member 14 from their flat or linear      shapes. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, for further ease of bending, the aperture 60 is oval in shape.      The particular size and shape of the aperture 60, as well as the aperture      62, however, can vary. </PAR><PAR>  The first outside end 52 of the contact member 14 is positioned for      connection to an electrical lead (not illustrated.) The lead can be      connected to the first outside end 52 in a variety of ways and is routed      to a power source within the appliance or similar article to which the      socket housing 12 is to be connected. </PAR><PAR>  The aperture 62 preferably is circular in shape and is positioned with      respect to the enlarged barbs 58 and the side wall 46 so that when the      inside end 54 of the contact member 14 is bent, it engages and grips the      interior wall surface 42 of the side wall 46 of the socket housing 12 and      pulls the contact member 14 toward the interior of the socket housing 12.      More specifically, as FIG. 3a illustrates, an inside bottom edge or corner      64 of the aperture 48 is slightly rounded to form an arc having a midpoint      substantially located at point 66. The contact member 14 will bend about a      midpoint 68 of the aperture 62. The midpoint 68 typically is aligned so      that when the inside end 54 is bent in the direction of arrow &quot;A&quot; from its      initial insertion position, illustrated in dotted outline, to its final      position proximate the side wall 46, the midpoint 68 of the aperture 62      aligns with the midpoint 66 of the inside bottom edge or corner 64 of the      aperture 48. The alignment of the midpoints 68 and 66 is not illustrated. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 3 illustrates, however, the midpoint 68 of the aperture 62 is      positioned so that it is slightly biased or offset toward the outside end      52 of the contact member 14 a slight distance &quot;b&quot;. Thus, due to the      relationship between the barbs 58, an outside point 70 (FIG. 2) which      abuts the barbs 58 and the inside bottom edge 64 of the aperture 48, the      midpoint 68 of the aperture 62 does not align with the midpoint 66 during      bending. With this design, the bending exerts an inward gripping and      pulling force on the contact member 14 to firmly seat the contact member      14 within the aperture 48 and restrict removal. </PAR><PAR>  The bottom contact member 16 is utilized for electrical contact with the      bottom of the light bulb base and, as FIG. 2 illustrates, likewise is a      substantially flat, elongate member having a first outside end 72, which      remains on the outside of the socket housing 12, and a second inside end      74, which remains on the inside of the socket housing 12. To assist in      engagement of the contact member 16 within the aperture 50, the contact      member 16 can include one or more barbs (not illustrated) similar to the      barbs 56 and 58 of the contact member 14. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, only the outside end 72 of the contact member 16 is bent      downward. Accordingly, to locate the bending point and prevent distortion      of the flat surfaces of the contact member 16, an aperture (not      illustrated), similar to the apertures 60 and 62 of the contact member 14,      can be formed in the contact member 16. As with the contact member 14, the      outside end 72 of the contact member 16 is designed for connection to an      electrical lead (not illustrated) for completing the electrical circuit      through the light bulb. </PAR><PAR>  As FIGS. 1 and 2 illustrate, to assist in engagement with the bottom      surface of the light bulb base, a top surface 76 of the inside end 74 of      the contact member 16 includes a raised dimple 78. Additionally, to      further assist in contact with the bottom surface of the light bulb base      to reduce intermittent electrical contact and take up any slack between      the threads 44 of the socket housing 12 and the threads of the light bulb      base, the inside end 74 of the contact member 16 can be angled upward away      from the bottom wall 22 of the socket housing 12. </PAR><PAR>  To provide the upward bending of the contact member 16, an inside bottom      edge 80 of the bottom aperture 50 includes an upward sloped ramp portion      82. Thus, upon insertion of the contact member 16 within the aperture 50,      the inside end 74 of the contact member 16 is deflected upward as      illustrated to a desired angle, which can vary. </PAR><PAR>  To assist in maintaining the inside end 74 of the contact member 16 in the      desired upward position, for providing a resilient spring force to the      contact member 16 and for restricting removal of the contact member 16      from the socket housing 12, a resilient leg 84 is struck substantially      along the center of a bottom side 86 of the contact member 16 and extends      downward toward the bottom wall 22 of the socket housing 12 when inserted      in the socket housing 12. Thus, upon insertion of the contact member 16      within the aperture 50 a predetermined distance defined by the positioning      of the enlarged barb (not illustrated) and corresponding outside insertion      point 70 of the aperture 50, the resilient leg 84 snaps over the end of      the ramp 82 to engage the ramp end 82a and bottom wall 22 and restricts      removal of the contact member 16 while providing the desired spring force      to the contact member 16. </PAR><PAR>  To assemble the light socket 10 illustrated in FIGS. 1-3a, the socket      housing 12 is provided with the threads 44, apertures 48 and 50 and ramp      82. Next, the contact members 14 and 16 are inserted, either separately or      simultaneously, into the respective apertures 48 and 50 until the enlarged      barbs 58 engage the outside points 70 of the apertures 48 and 50. At this      point, the resilient leg 84 of the contact member 16 seats behind the ramp      end 82a as illustrated in FIG. 2. Next a bending tool (not illustrated) is      inserted within the socket housing 12, engages the inside end 54 of the      contact member 14 and bends the contact member 14 about the biased      aperture 62 to grip the inside curved edge 64 of the aperture 48 and      connect and pull the contact member 14 inward. </PAR><PAR>  The socket housing 12 now is ready for connection to the electrical leads      and, if desired, installation in a panel 24 as described above. It is to      be noted that assembly of the socket housing 12 and the contact members 14      and 11 can be accomplished manually or can be fully automated.      Additionally, the electrical leads can be connected to the contact members      14 and 16 before or after installation with the panel. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 4-8 illustrate an alternate embodiment of the light socket 110 where      common elements are referred to by the same reference numerals. In this      embodiment, the socket housing 112 includes two contact members 114 and      116 which extend through the bottom wall 122 so that the socket housing      112 can be positioned approximately perpendicular with respect to the      panel 24. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 5 illustrates, to connect the socket housing 112 to an aperture 26      in a panel 24, the socket housing 112 includes a flange 128 positioned      about the outside periphery of the side wall 146 of the socket housing 112      as well as two resilient engagement prong members 134, one each on      opposite sides of the socket housing 112. Thus, similar to the embodiment      of FIGS. 1-3a, the socket housing 112 is inserted within the aperture 26      of the panel 24 and the resilient engagement prong members 134 engage the      margins of the aperture 26. If desired, additional locator arms (not      illustrated) can be positioned about the bottom side 130 of the flange 128      to assist in alignment of the socket housing 112 with the aperture 26 of      the panel 24. </PAR><PAR>  in this embodiment, the bottom 122 of the socket housing 112 includes      slotted apertures 148 and 150 for the flat contact members 114 and 116,      respectively. The contact member 114 extends through the aperture 148 and      along the interior wall surface 142 of the socket housing 112. To assist      in positioning of the contact member 114, the interior wall surface 142      can include a slot 142a for receiving the contact member 114 therein. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be noted that the positioning of the apertures 48/148 and 50/150      within the respective side wall 46/146 and bottom 22/122 of the socket      housing 12/112 can be interchanged so long as they function as described.      For example, the socket housing 12/112 can be formed with the aperture 48      in the side wall 46 for the contact member 14 and the aperture 150 in the      bottom 122 for the contact member 116 (not illustrated). </PAR><PAR>  The contact member 114 is a substantially flat, elongate member having a      first outside end 152, which remains on the outside of the socket housing      112, and a second inside end 154, which remains on the inside of the      socket housing 112. The inside end 154 of the contact member 114 is      designed for electrical contact with the side surface of the light bulb      base. To assist in such electrical contact and for proper thread      engagement of the threads 44 of the socket housing 112 and the threads on      the light bulb base, the contact member 114 can include a first resilient      leg member 114a which is struck from the surface of, or otherwise      connected to, the contact member 114 so that it extends into the interior      of the socket housing 112 when assembled. </PAR><PAR>  To restrict removal of the contact member 114 from the aperture 148, the      contact member 114 also includes a pair of second resilient leg members      114b which likewise are struck from the surface of the contact member 114      on opposite longitudinal sides of the contact member 114 so that they      extend into the interior of the socket housing 112 when assembled. The      second resilient leg members 114b function similar to the resilient leg 84      of the contact member 16 of the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3a. Thus, upon      insertion, the second resilient leg members 114b extend into the socket      housing 112 after they clear the aperture 148 and engage with the bottom      wall 122 to restrict removal of the contact member 114. </PAR><PAR>  To restrict further inward extension of the second resilient leg members      114b, the bottom surface 122 is formed with a pair of upstanding stops      121, one each for engagement with a respective second resilient leg member      114b. The stops 121 prevent inward displacement of the second resilient      leg members 114b along the bottom surface 122 which may occur if an      attempt is made to pull the contact member 114 out of the aperture 148. </PAR><PAR>  The contact member 116 likewise is a substantially flat, elongate member      having a first outside end 172 and a second inside end 174. As FIG. 8      illustrates, the contact member 116 includes barbs 156 and 158 as well as      a bending aperture 162 for locating a bend on the outside end 172, if      desired. </PAR><PAR>  To ensure proper insertion of the contact member 116 in the aperture 150,      the second inside end 174 is keyed with a leg 116a extending substantially      perpendicular to the plane of the contact member 116. Thus, as FIG. 6      illustrates, the aperture 150 includes a complementary keyway 150a through      which the leg 116a is inserted. If desired, the contact member 114, as      well as the contact members 14 and 16 of the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3a, can      be keyed in a similar manner. </PAR><PAR>  To retain the contact member 116 within the socket housing 112 and provide      the desired upward spring force to the contact member 116 against a light      bulb base, opposite longitudinal sides of the contact member 116 are      struck to form a pair of resilient leg members 116b, one each per side.      The leg members 116b function similar to the second resilient leg members      114b of contact member 114. </PAR><PAR>  After insertion of the contact member 116, however, the contact member 116      is bent substantially about the line c--c of FIG. 8 proximate the position      where the distal ends of the resilient leg members 116b were struck from      the contact member 116 leaving a reduced lateral portion of the contact      member 116. As FIGS. 4-6 illustrate, the contact member 116 is bent about      a raised ramp portion 123 formed on the bottom side 122 of the socket      housing 112 on the side of the aperture 150 facing the aperture 148. </PAR><PAR>  As the contact member 116 is bent, the resilient leg members 116b engage      stops 123a formed on the bottom 122 of the socket housing 112 along the      aperture 150 on the side of the aperture 150 opposite the ramp portion      123. Accordingly, the cooperation between the resilient leg members 116b,      stops 123a and bottom 122 restricts removal of the contact member 116.      This structure also provides an upward spring force to the contact member      116 to assist in engagement with the bottom of the light bulb base. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 5 illustrates, in order to provide a tighter fit within the      apertures 148 and 150, the contact members 114 and 116 include a raised      dimple 115. As FIG. 8 illustrates with regard to contact member 116, the      dimple 115 is formed substantially in the center of the contact member 116      between the distal ends of the resilient leg members 116b and the barbs      156. Thus, when positioned within the apertures 148 and 150, the dimples      115 engage the margins of the apertures 148 and 150 to provide the desired      tight fit. It is to be noted that the dimples 115 slightly compress the      margins of the apertures 148 and 150. </PAR><PAR>  To assist a machine or a user in gripping the contact members 114 and 116      during insertion, the first outside ends 152 and 172 can be formed with      one or more engagement ribs 152a and 172a. If desired, the contact members      14 and 16 of the embodiment of FIGS. 1-3a can include engagement ribs      similar to ribs 152a and 172a and dimples similar to dimples 115. </PAR><PAR>  To assemble the light socket 110, the socket housing 112 is provided with      the threads 44, apertures 148 and 150 as well as the stops 121 and 123a      and the ramp 123. Next, the contact members 114 and 116 are inserted,      either separately or simultaneously, within the corresponding apertures      148 and 150 until the barbs 158 engage the outside points 70 of the      apertures 148 and 150. At this point, the resilient leg members 114b      engage the bottom wall 122 and stops 121 to restrict removal of the      contact member 114. Next, a bending tool (not illustrated) is inserted      within the socket housing 112, engages the inside end 174 of the contact      member 116 and bends the contact member 116 about the line c--c to the      final assembly position with the resilient leg members 116b engaged with      the stops 123a to restrict removal of the contact member 116. If desired,      the first outside ends 152 and 172 of the contact members 114 and 116 can      be bent about apertures 160 and 162 and the socket housing 112 connected      to a panel 24 as described in the previous embodiment. </PAR><PAR>  The molding of the socket housing 112 now will be explained in detail with      reference to FIGS. 9-11. FIG. 9 illustrates a portion of the threads 44      formed on the interior wall surface 42 of the socket housing 12 engaged      with a portion of the mold core 36 utilized to form the interior threads      44 of the socket housing 12 or 112. The threads 44 are formed with crests      44a, roots 44b and slightly flat portions 44c between the roots 44b to a      specific profile. The flat portions 44c are utilized to maintain proper      spacing between crests 44a and the length of the flat portions 44c may      vary, or the flat portions 44c may not be necessary. The crests 44a, roots      44b and flat portions 44c are formed by corresponding roots 36a, crests      36b and slightly flat portions 36c between the crests 36b of the mold core      36. </PAR><PAR>  As discussed above, the easiest and least expensive way to mold the socket      housing 12 in one-piece is to provide a non-collapsible mold core 36.      After molding, the mold core 36 merely is pulled out or stripped from the      socket housing 12, typically while the socket housing 12 still is slightly      soft and retained in the remainder of the mold (not illustrated) forming      the outside surfaces of the socket housing 12. </PAR><PAR>  As FIG. 10 illustrates, however, as the mold core 36 is pulled out of the      socket housing 12 in the direction of arrow &quot;B&quot;, the crests 36b of the      mold core 36 must pass over the crests 44a of the threads 44. Thus, the      crests 44a of the threads 44 become slightly deformed from their initial      shape which is indicated in dotted outline in FIGS. 10 and 11. This      deformation provides a build up of material at 44d on the outside edge of      each thread 44 facing the top open end 18 of the socket housing 12.      Additionally, the crest 44a which is closest to the top open end 18 of the      socket housing 12 typically is deformed the most since several mold core      crests 36b pass thereover as the mold core 36 is pulled out. </PAR><PAR>  The material 44d typically provides threads 44 which fall outside the      thread profile of the desired standard and cause binding cf a test gauge      45, which simulates the thread size of the light bulb base to be inserted      later. Thus, a non-collapsible mold core 36 typically is not used,      especially when close thread tolerances must be maintained. </PAR><PAR>  The threads 44 of FIGS. 9-11, however, are dimensioned to eliminate any      binding. Specifically, as FIG. 9 illustrates, the crests 44a are formed      with a radius which is somewhat less than the radius of the roots 44b. The      radius of the roots 44b substantially are equal to the desired thread      standard and preferably are slightly greater than the desired thread      standard. </PAR><PAR>  Accordingly, as FIG. 11 illustrates, when the test gauge 45, having the      desired thread standard with the same crest and root radii, is threadingly      engaged with the socket housing 12, the deformed crests 44a and the excess      material 44d still fall within the desired thread profile represented by      the test gauge 45. This eliminates any binding between the threads 44 and      the threads on the test gauge 45 while still providing close thread      engagement without any excessive play. The different radii between the      crests 44a and roots 44b effectively provide a space within the thread      profile of the test gauge 45 which accommodates the excess material 44d. </PAR><PAR>  For example, if the desired thread standard is to be 0.046 inches (1.17      mm), it has been found that the radius of the roots 44b should be 0.047      inches (1.19 mm), andplus;/-0.004 inches (0.10 mm), while the radius of the      crests 44a should be 0.030 inches (0.76 mm), andplus;/-0.004 inches (0.10 mm). As      another example, if the desired thread standard is to be 0.030 inches      (0.76 mm), it has been found that the radius of the roots 44b should be      0.031 inches (0.79 mm), andplus;--0.004 inches (0.10 mm), and that the radius of      the crests 44a should be 0.025 inches (0.63 mm), andplus;/-0.004 inches (0.10      mm). </PAR><PAR>  Modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light      of the above teachings. It is therefore to be understood that within the      scope of the appended claims, the invention may be practiced otherwise      than as specifically described. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed and desired to be secured by Letters Patent of the United      States is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
