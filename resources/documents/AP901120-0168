Former Texas Court of Criminal Appeals Judge John Onion quashedthe misdemeanor perjury indictment in a hearing, a courtspokeswoman said, referring all other questions to AssistantDistrict Attorney Ted Steinke.   Steinke said the DA's office was drafting a new indictment thatwould be filed Wednesday. ``This happens every day in thecourthouse. It's not unusual at all,'' he said.   Vines said he was relieved the perjury charge was thrown out.   ``I hope and pray that ... the assistant district attorney andthe district attorney's office will see the wisdom in notrefiling,'' he said.   ``We'll review the new indictment, if they file, and see if it'sproperly done,'' said his attorney, Bill Boyd. ``If not we'll fileto quash, again. If they've done it right, we'll prepare fortrial.''   Vines was fired by Dallas City Manager Jan Hart on Sept. 12,hours after being indicted on the perjury charge. He is accused oflying to a special panel investigating the June 1989 firing ofofficer Patrick LeMaire, who fatally shot an unarmed man last year.LeMaire was reinstated in July by an administrative law judge butdeclined to return to the police force.   The perjury charge alleged that Vines lied to the panel about atelephone conversation he had with assistant police chief GregHolliday on Aug. 2, the night before Holliday was to testify beforethe panel. Holliday said Vines tried to influence his testimony.Vines has maintained his innocence.   Boyd said the indictment was quashed because ``the law in Texasrequires that if you allege perjury, you must first show thestatement that you allege to be false and then state what you claimthe truth to be.''   ``They made a general allegation in the indictment as to whatthey claimed to be false and they made no allegation as to whatthey claimed the truth to be,'' he said.   Tuesday's action was the latest setback in the districtattorney's prosecution of Vines, who had been police chief for twoyears.   Prosecutors initially filed the case in state district court,but were told last month that the court had no jurisdiction becauseofficial misconduct was not alleged.   The case was moved to Dallas County Criminal Court, where JudgeJohn McCall stepped aside and asked Onion to preside.   The city began a nationwide search for a new police chief afterVines' dismissal. Sixty-two candidates have applied for the job,including Acting Chief Sam Gonzales.</TEXT></DOC>
