The purpose is to gain experience inthe range of techniques available for characterizing SDHW systems andfor predicting their long-term performance. The fourteen methods summarizedcan be logically grouped into the following categories: system performancefor a range of weather conditions characterized by parameters determinedfrom individual component tests; system performance for a range of weatherconditions determined from measurements on the whole system; system performancefor a range of weather conditions determined from a combination of separately-measuredcomponent parameters and whole system measurements; system performancedetermined as a function of internal variables from measurements on thewhole system; and system performance determined for specific test conditionsonly. The methods have been designed to meet different specific requirements.An attempt has been made to describe the basic principles of the methods,to indicate the state of development, and to identify the advantagesand disadvantages of each approach. These test methods form the basisof a joint IEA Task III programme to develop common test procedures thatincorporate the best features of the individual methods. This reportis based on the work performed under Subtask E: Development of a Capabilityto Evaluate Domestic Hot Water System Performance Using Short-Term Methods.</TEXT></DOC>
