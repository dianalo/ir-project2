But most other corporate groups reported year-to-year gains, and securities analysts expect banks as well as other companies to do well in the second half of this year.    In the quarter ended June 30, after-tax earnings on continuing operations of 524 major corporations fell 20% from a year earlier, a Wall Street Journal survey finds. Net income dropped 21%, in contrast to a 13% increase in the first quarter.    The 21% drop is the biggest decline since a 30% plunge in the 1982 fourth period, the final quarter of the 1981-82 recession. But the 25 major banks in the Journal's compilation lost a total of $10.7 billion, and they aren't representative even of the banking industry. Because the increases in reserves were generally limited to major banks, such as those in the Journal table, the nation's other 14,000 banks, as a group, probably did better.    If the big banks are left out of the compilation, the other companies' net income rose 22% in the second quarter. Of the 37 corporate groups surveyed, 22 chalked up year-to-year profit gains, and four more moved from red ink to black.    In some industry groups, a huge loss-to-profit swing at one company produced a big percentage gain; such was the case with the instruments makers because of Eastman Kodak's resurgence to sizable earnings. Much the same occurred with the railroads, which were depressed in the 1986 second quarter by big write-offs. The effects of cost cutting and restructuring aided other industrial sectors, such as the chemicals and tires and rubber groups. The lower dollar also helped the chemicals, as well as the drug makers.    However, some groups, such as thrifts and oil companies, posted mixed results, and others, such as nonferrous metals, were dragged down by write-offs at one company. The oil-field-services group has only begun to recover, and securities firms took a beating in the bond market.    Strong profits in most industries, and the prospect of more to come, are helping support stock prices. &quot;The market is still being dominated by earnings-driven groups, and many of these performers -- steels, aluminum, metals and chemicals, as well as selected technology issues -- should continue to make good showings,&quot; A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons, a St. Louis investment firm, says in a recent analysis.    &quot;With the corporate tax rate dropping to 34% on July 1,&quot; says Lacy H. Hunt, the chief economist at Carroll, McEntee andamp; McGinley, &quot;corporate profits will bulge dramatically in the second half of this year.&quot;    And most analysts expect the profit gains to continue into 1988. However, they see the climb slowing, partly because the year-to-year comparisons will be against high 1987 numbers. A.G. Edwards expects the profit-growth momentum to peak &quot;near the end of this year.&quot;    The 51 analysts surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, have been generally raising their 1987 forecasts and now expect, on the average, an 11.6% gain. But they predict only a 7.2% increase next year.    The forecasts are based on an assumption that the economy will continue to expand through 1988, though at a moderate pace of less than 3%. Alexander P. Paris of Barrington Research Associates notes that companies in recent years have cut costs so aggressively that their break-even points have declined sharply. Thus, even modest gains in sales can produce substantial gains in profits. If business does accelerate, Mr. Paris adds, profits could soar.    Here are the second-quarter profits for various industry groups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter. When individual companies report for three-month periods other than calendar quarters, the nearest comparable periods are used. In all the tables, 000s have been omitted.    AEROSPACE   Aerospace earnings varied widely, as defense contractors continued to adjust to competition resulting from a leveling-off in Pentagon spending and new procurement regulations. One of the companies most affected was Northrop, which took a pretax charge of $124.3 million for increased costs on a research and development contract believed to be the Stealth bomber. Northrop also was hurt by lower margins on contracts for MX missile and F-15 jetfighter equipment. United Technologies' 1986 second quarter included a pretax provision of $155 million for estimated contract losses at its Norden Systems division, which has been having difficulty controlling costs on radar contracts. At Rohr, a two-week strike by machinists cut net by $5.3 million. Pension-accounting changes increased Rockwell's net income by $26.6 million and McDonnell Douglas's pretax earnings by $48.6 million. Fairchild Industries, which is restructuring, had an $8.5 million tax gain and $1.7 million in income from discontinued operations; the company also had nonrecurring items a year earlier. &quot;There continues to be pressure on military margins because of cost sharing,&quot; says Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. He expects United Technologies to benefit in the second half from an early-retirement program but sees Boeing's third-quarter earnings hurt by seasonally low delivery rates.                                 2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    13 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Boeing Co                   117,000    169,000     - 31    Fairchild Inds               18,780      3,832     +390    General Dynamics            125,100    103,500     + 21    Grumman Corp                 11,634     17,631     - 34    Lockheed Corp               100,000     96,000     +  4    Martin Marietta              71,581     57,325     + 25    McDonnell Doug               97,100     81,200     + 20    Northrop Corp               -15,400     23,100      ...

Trans World, reflecting its purchase of Ozark AirLines this year, reported net income of $52.8 million,against a year-earlier loss of $87 million due to a flightattendants' strike and a slump in international sales becauseof terrorism threats. Pan Am's trans-Atlantic trafficincreased 42% from the 1986 second quarter, and the carrierposted a $10.5 million profit, against a year-earlier loss.But net income of AMR Corp., American's parent, dropped 33%to $92.2 million, reflecting a one-time $50.3 million gain inthe year-earlier quarter. Texas Air, still digesting itsmerger of People Express into its Continental Airlines unit,had a $27 million net loss; its year-earlier deficit was$66.2 million.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    11 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Allegis Corp                 73,386     18,457     +298    AMR Corp                     92,167    137,979     - 33    Delta Air Lines              58,797     22,225     +165    NWA Inc                      50,647     23,894     +112    Pan Am Corp                  10,453   -152,379      ...

APPAREL   Earnings perked up, with some slightly exceedingexpectations. &quot;Business is okay, but we're not off to theraces,&quot; says Jay Meltzer, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. analyst.&quot;The strong companies, because of restructuring and costcutting, are doing all right,&quot; he adds, but the industry is&quot;feeling a moderate squeeze&quot; due to higher raw-material costsand the effect of the lower dollar on goods that thecompanies import. However, cost pressures are being offset bystronger sales and a lower tax rate. At Liz Claiborne, forexample, pretax profit margin was 18.6%, down from 19.3% ayear earlier, but the net margin rose to 10.3% from 9.9%, Mr.Meltzer says. For the industry in general, the second half&quot;will be positive but somewhat less positive than the secondquarter,&quot; he predicts. At VF Corp., Jerome Wiggins, the vicepresident of finance, says earnings were higher thanexpected, noting that &quot;the tax rate has helped.&quot; The recentlyacquired Blue Bell division, which makes Wrangler jeans,Jantzen sportswear and Red Cap uniforms, helpedsecond-quarter profit, Mr. Wiggins says. Munsingwear's losswas largely due to production-scheduling problems in itsmenswear and women's intimate-apparel divisions. LarryHorsch, the chairman, says, &quot;There were plenty of orders --the order rate is still very good -- but the merchandise wasnot produced on time.&quot;                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    11 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Brown Group                  10,030      7,833     + 28    Genesco Inc                  -2,897     -5,736      ...

The reasons:better-than-expected profits at General Motors and Chryslerand a second record quarter in a row at Ford. GM's net incomedropped only 3.7%, confounding analysts, who had expected a23% to 43% plunge. The company was helped by an income-taxrate of only 9.8%, compared with a more-normal 34.8% a yearbefore. But on a pretax basis, before the earnings ofnonconsolidated subsidiaries, the No. 1 auto maker's earningsdropped 40%; because of weak sales, GM made 17% fewer cars inthe quarter than a year earlier. Chrysler benefited fromhigher profit margins because of strong sales of trucks andminivans. Operating profit rose 20%, although net incomedropped 12% because the 1986 quarter included a gain fromChrysler's sale of its stake in Peugeot S.A. Ford's nettopped GM's for the fifth consecutive quarter, even thoughFord's sales are only two-thirds GM's. Analysts expect abetter third quarter than last year's because of strength atFord and Chrysler, but big uncertainties remain. A strikewhen the United Auto Workers contract expires Sept. 14 wouldhurt GM and Ford, and the major new buyer incentives to selloff 1987 models will reduce profits at all three companies.Analysts expect GM to make a depreciation-accounting changethat will bolster earnings, but David Healy of Drexel BurnhamLambert still thinks that the company will post an operatingloss.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    15 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    American Motors              30,230    -52,043      ...

Withoutexception, big banks copied Citicorp's May 19 move toincrease its loan-loss reserves by $3 billion. All told, theindustry added more than $14 billion to reserves and posted aquarterly loss exceeding $10 billion. Only some big regionalbanks were spared the carnage. Comparisons with 1986second-quarter results were further distorted bytax-equivalent adjustments on the value of certain securitiesbecause of lower federal income-tax rates. In accounting forincome from these securities, second-quarter net interestincome this year was lower than it would have been under lastyear's tax rates. The outlook for the rest of 1987 isconsiderably brighter. Banks are expected to post sharplyhigher earnings in future quarters, as they should be able toreduce their normal loan-loss provisions. Nevertheless, thesecond-quarter losses were so enormous that many large banksare expected to post losses for the year.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    25 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Bank of Boston              -83,700     53,300      ...

Stephen Albert ofKidder Peabody says interest rates, while slightly higherthan a year ago, &quot;are still low; they aren't at the pointwhere it shuts off activity.&quot; Vigorous cost cutting andhealthy demand aided second-quarter results. Although housingstarts fell about 14% from a year earlier, housingcompletions, a measure of ongoing activity, edged down only abit. Manville credited its higher earnings to cost cuttingand firm prices for its wood and paper products. AmericanStandard said its results in building products wereparticularly strong outside the U.S. Its net income included$6.2 million of losses on the sale of discontinuedoperations, and the 1986 quarter had a $40.8 million gain onthe sale of a discontinued line and an extraordinary loss of$4.7 million. Cement producers suffered from low prices,partly because of imports. In addition, USG said it was hurtby lower prices for domestic gypsum board. Certain-Teed's netwas hurt by a $6.4 million after-tax charge for plantclosings, and Owens-Corning had a $14.3 million charge forfees associated with a bank credit facility that will beterminated and refinanced on more favorable terms.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    16 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    American Standard            33,000     75,400     - 56    Armstrong World              41,100     35,100     + 17    Certain-Teed Corp            14,720     16,127     -  9    Corning Glass                53,300     57,300     -  7    Giant Group Ltd               3,689      3,639     +  1    Ideal Basic Inds              1,854     -5,001      ...

Profit margins approached 40% for products such aspolypropylene, which is used in appliances, cars andpackaging. Union Carbide's net fell 82% and W.R. Grace posteda 61% decline, even though both chalked up a surge in incomefrom continuing operations; a year earlier, the companies hadbig one-time gains from the sale of certain operations.International Minerals andamp; Chemical reported a small loss,compared with a $214.7 million deficit in its 1986 fiscalfourth quarter stemming mostly from charges for planneddispositions and restructuring. Similarly, NL Industriesreported a small profit, against a $293.6 million net loss ayear earlier due to restructuring moves. In the thirdquarter, chemical producers' profits should run 20% to 25%ahead of last year, says Charles Rose, an Oppenheimer andamp; Co.analyst. &quot;The industry will continue to try to raise prices,&quot;he says, adding that further profit gains may come from thecompanies' recent diversification into drugs, electronics andother businesses.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    22 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Air Pdts andamp; Chem              40,065    -78,639      ...

Neil Sweig ofPrudential-Bache Securities says foreign-currency gainscontributed about six percentage points to his calculation ofthe drug group's 22% average earnings-per-share gain.Analysts predict that earnings growth will flag slightly inthe second half as the dollar stabilizes. Merck and Squibbcharged ahead on sales of expensive, big-selling heart drugs,and Upjohn continued to gain from its new tranquilizer-typeproducts. Merck also benefited from other new drugs, forinfections, ulcers and animal-health problems, and Squibbfrom the 1986 sale of a low-profit medical-equipment company.Bristol-Myers posted a big gain partly because, in the 1986second quarter, it had incurred costs stemming from itswithdrawal from the capsule-products market. Warner-Lambert'sprofit drop was due to a one-time gain a year earlier;excluding that, earnings rose 11%.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    17 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Abbott Labs                 155,110    133,665     + 16    Am Home Pdts                195,876    181,292     +  8    Bristol-Myers               161,508    119,309     + 35    Eli Lilly andamp; Co              150,300    125,700     + 20    Johnson andamp; Johnson           224,400    189,800     + 18    Marion Labs                  28,727     14,674     + 96    Merck andamp; Co                  235,100    173,200     + 36    Pfizer Inc                  175,800    156,100     + 13    Robins A H Co                 7,736      8,318     -  7    Rorer Group                  10,879     12,619     - 14    Schering-Plough              82,500     71,800     + 15    SmithKline Beckman          132,100    123,400     +  7    Squibb Corp                  95,200     67,700     + 41    Sterling Drug                44,371     38,066     + 17    Syntex                       62,400     53,100     + 18    Upjohn Co                    78,608     64,714     + 21    Warner-Lambert               80,810    120,591     - 33    TOTAL                     1,921,425  1,654,048     + 16   ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT   Most companies continued to post stronger results, showingeither larger profits or a turnaround from year-earlierlosses. As in the first quarter, the biggest swings were atsemiconductor companies, such as Motorola and Intel, whichhave mostly broken out of a cyclical slump. Forelectrical-connector companies, such as AMP, &quot;the earningsare very positive, year over year,&quot; says Stephen J. Balog, ananalyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. However,electronic-instrument companies, such as Varian Associates,aren't showing a comparable upturn so far, but, on the basisof bookings, Mr. Balog sees one at hand. Penn Centralreported lower operating earnings, but the year-earlierfigures were inflated by pension-plan terminations and otherunusual items. Singer posted a loss because of a charge dueto development costs of three aerospace-electronics programs.TRW blamed higher interest costs and a higher tax rate forits lower earnings, but said it expects a double-digitpercentage rise in net for the year. Whirlpool attributed itsprofit drop to increased production costs as well as higherselling and administrative expenses. The industry's generalimprovement is expected to continue for at least anotherquarter and, barring a recession, through next year.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    27 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    AMP Inc                      62,510     42,288     + 48    AVX Corp                      3,800       -115      ...

Operating profits of NationalMedical Enterprises and Charter Medical reflected strongdemand for psychiatric and substance-abuse treatment.National Medical blamed its loss on a $72.8 million write-offof discontinued businesses. Nursing-home profits were hurt bydeclines in Medicare patients and higher operating expenses.Hospital chains' profits will continue to improve this year,with the aid of the 1986 restructurings as well as theoccupancy trend, says Margo L. Vignola, a Salomon Brothersanalyst. In the 1986 second quarter, American MedicalInternational's profit included an after-tax gain of $8.1million, mainly from sale of a hospital, and BaxterTravenol's included an after-tax gain of $13 million fromdiscontinued operations.

Fluor was hurt by $18.9 million in losses fromits Fluor Constructors operations and corporate tax expenseof $9.7 million; last year's second quarter included an $8.7million tax benefit that offset a $2.1 million loss fromdiscontinued operations. Fluor expects a much-improved secondhalf. Morrison-Knudsen blamed its profit slide on a drop-offin shipbuilding. Nonetheless, the contract backlog at June 30rose to $3.55 billion, a five-year high. Ameron posted a 157%profit increase in the fiscal second quarter, after a $5.8million gain from asset sales. Blount's operating income rose68% in its fiscal first quarter, aided by its WashingtonSteel unit, where increased shipping levels and manufacturingefficiencies contributed to a 64% surge in operating income.Dravo's second-quarter loss, which pushed it into technicaldefault on certain loan agreements, reflected a $22 millionpretax charge for losses on two waste-to-energy power-plantcontracts, a $17 million provision for staff-reduction costsand a $3.1 million item related to sales of discontinuedbusinesses.

The group's showing was bolsteredmainly by Deere's $35.3 million profit in its April 30quarter, against a year-earlier loss of $28.9 million. Deerecited an $11 million tax benefit as well as a 12% sales gainresulting partly from its efforts to catch up on productionafter a five-month strike. In addition, the 1986 secondquarter included a $32.2 million charge for staff cuts.Caterpillar's earnings fell 15% because of sharp inventoryreductions in the year-earlier quarter, which resulted in a$35 million accounting credit, compared with $1 million inthe latest period. A recapitalization lifted Colt's interestexpenses and thus accounted for its 49% earnings drop. &quot;Mostcompanies aren't seeing better margins yet due to the weakerdollar,&quot; says Mitchell Quain, an analyst at Wertheim Schroderandamp; Co.

Bourke, Reynolds Metals'chief executive. KaiserTech's aluminum operations, excludingone-time items, were profitable on an operating basis; itshuge loss, which depressed the whole group's figures, mostlyresulted from $354.5 million in pretax charges to write downaluminum mills. Alcoa's big second-quarter loss reflectedone-time items. It took after-tax charges of $141.8 millionfor closing operations and $23.9 million for retiringhigh-interest debt. Its results also included $12.7 millionin foreign-currency losses, compared with currency gains of$2.9 million a year earlier. The industry's current quarteris continuing strong. Customers are still rebuilding depletedinventories. In addition, a threatened strike at AlcanAluminium's Quebec smelter on Aug. 31 could further tightenthe market. At other nonferrous-metals producers, earningsrose largely because of corporate restructuring, which hasreduced U.S. companies' operating costs to world levels andhas shrunk inventories so much that modest increases indemand have raised prices. The third quarter looks&quot;exciting,&quot; says Peter Anker of First Boston Corp., becauseprice increases for aluminum, copper, lead, zinc and silvershould start lifting profits. Ron Shorr of Bear, Stearns andamp;Co. says recent price increases &quot;were just the tip of theiceberg&quot; compared with what's coming in the third quarter,but he warns that with demand rising, some copper producersare starting to reopen old, high-cost mines, a move thatcould hurt their profitability.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    11 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Aluminum Co Am              -91,200     53,300      ...

Continued increasesin prices and exploration work will permit more companies tobegin posting at least modest profits by the third or fourthquarter, analysts predict. Halliburton, whose 1986 secondquarter included $488.7 million in write-downs, said itsoperating losses in oil-field-service operations narrowedsubstantially. The company told shareholders that it expectsprofitable operations in the 1987 second half, a prelude to asustained improvement. Schlumberger's profit plunged, but thecompany noted that revenues in oil-field-service markets hadimproved from the first quarter. McDermott'sfiscal-fourth-quarter deficit included $195.9 million oflosses from discontinued operations.

PETROLEUM   Helped by higher petroleum prices, oil companies generallyreported second-quarter earnings gains, some stronger thanexpected. But weak natural-gas prices hurt profits of somecompanies, such as Phillips Petroleum and Sun, which posteddeclines. Occidental Petroleum's earnings rose, but it wouldhave had a loss without a gain from the sale of a Colombianoil property. And refiner profit margins remained underpressure as prices of petroleum products, though rising,continued to lag behind increases in crude-oil costs. Thiswas a key factor in Mobil's profit drop. For the thirdquarter, petroleum refiners expect improved profit margins,largely because of a strong gasoline market. Chemicalsearnings, which have been setting records for many oilcompanies, are likely to remain strong. And, if crude-oilprices hold near current levels, exploration and productionprofits will surge again. For the domestic integrated oilcompanies -- those with crude-oil production as well asrefining operations -- Bernard J. Picchi, Salomon Brothersoil analyst, forecasts &quot;60% to 70% improvement in earnings ona year-to-year basis in the third quarter.&quot;                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    22 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    Amerada Hess                 89,386     19,652     +355    American Petrofina           28,680      4,432     +547    Amoco Corp                  311,000    238,000     + 31    Ashland Oil Inc              39,959     82,380     - 51    Atlantic Richfield          330,000    150,000     +120    Chevron Corp                344,000    216,000     + 59    Crown Central P              -2,637      6,256      ...

One indication is thesecond-quarter reports by the two major retailers operatingon a calendar year: Profit rose 3% for the merchandise groupof Sears Roebuck and 36% to $19 million for Mobil'sMontgomery Ward unit. The strongest profit increases areexpected from discounters. Sharp gains are likely at WalMartStores, which used its tax savings to cut prices and bolstersales, and at K mart. Among mass merchandisers, strongapparel sales are expected to boost J.C. Penney's earnings.Dayton Hudson, which has been struggling to turn around itsailing Mervyn's chain, is the only major retailer likely toreport lower earnings. Dayton Hudson will be hurt by costs ofits acquisition and conversion of Gemco store sites, saysRichard Pyle, an analyst at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood.

Nevertheless, it was in theblack after one-time, after-tax gains of $124.5 million fromselling some real-estate and leasing operations. AmericanExpress posted a loss after adding $600 million to itsforeign banking unit's debt reserves. Some firms more thancompensated for tough trading markets with investment-bankinggains.

Hutton Group posted a profit with the aid of a$51.6 million after-tax gain on the sale of its insuranceunit, plus a $9.8 million tax-loss carry-forward. But oncontinuing operations, Hutton said it lost $17.3 million,mostly because of weak bond-trading revenue.

She adds that its overseas profitsurged 72% but that domestic results were &quot;as ho-hum asinternational profits were spectacular.&quot; Avon's internationalbeauty business also was brisk, with profit up 36%. Lookingahead, Avon Chairman Hicks Waldron says, &quot;We expect sales andnet income to increase in the second half, particularly inthe fourth quarter.&quot; At Colgate-Palmolive, the world-widelaunching of new products such as Colgate Tartar Controltoothpaste is aiding sales, says Brenda Landry of MorganStanley, though the benefits will begin to fade in the secondhalf. Colgate Chairman Reuben Mark says higher advertisingand marketing costs were offset by cost controls.

Armco was buoyed by gainstotaling $12 million from tax-loss carry-forwards and astock-for-debt exchange, plus a $14.7 million tax credit. Theyear-earlier quarter was blighted by $343 million in charges.Bethlehem reported a $32.5 million tax credit under a tax-lawprovision granting steelmakers a 50% cash rebate of unusedinvestment tax credits; the company had gains of $75 millionand charges of $55 million the year before. Steelmakerspushed through price increases with the aid of the fallingdollar, which has forced foreign producers to raise prices onexports to the U.S. But although prices have surged in spottransactions, they appear to have risen only modestly inlong-term contracts, which account for most orders. Theindustry should remain profitable through the currentquarter, but many executives are worrying about potentialcutbacks in auto-industry orders in the second half.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    9 Firms                       1987       1986       Chg    Armco Inc                    36,200   -384,700      ...

AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph posted higher-than-expected net becauseof strong earnings in long-distance operations and costcutting in its unprofitable business of selling phone andcomputer equipment to the public. MCI Communications, UnitedTelecommunications and GTE Corp. were hurt by the need tomatch ATandamp;T's price cuts in long-distance service. At United,which posted a loss, and at GTE, start-up costs of their USSprint joint venture were heavy, and the companies announceda $350 million pretax write-off for US Sprint to account fordepreciation and lease costs and uncollectible accounts.United said US Sprint's losses should narrow in the secondhalf. At the regional Bell companies, Bell Atlantic reportedhigher profits, but Pacific Telesis Group and BellSouthposted declines. Analysts say the Baby Bells are earningclose to their allowed rates of return and have wrung as muchcost out of their businesses as they can for the time being.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    12 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    American Info Tech          275,800    284,500     -  3    American Tel andamp; Tel          596,000    422,000     + 41    Bell Atlantic               326,100    307,400     +  6    BellSouth                   382,300    408,500     -  6    Contel Corp                  46,901     56,882     - 18    GTE Corp                    223,153    308,648     - 28    MCI Communic                  8,000     16,000     - 50    Nynex Corp                  322,756    310,800     +  4    Pacific Telesis             272,300    283,000     -  4    Southwestern Bell           248,800    279,200     - 11    U S West Inc                268,800    270,200     -  1    United Telecomm            -118,275     56,245      ...

However,some concerns reported a soft residential-carpeting market,and others were hurt by rising prices for cotton and otherraw materials. Cotton prices, instead of remaining low andlifting earnings as expected, have risen in response toincreased demand and short supplies. But this fall,manufacturers are expected to offset their higher costs byraising prices on bed and bath products and other goods.Fieldcrest Cannon, the exception to the generally higherprofits, largely blamed raw-materials costs for its 60%decline in net. The company also reported a $6 millioninventory-accounting charge reflecting the higher materialscosts, and it said profit was hurt by startup expensesrelated to introduction of stain-resistant residentialcarpeting. Though Burlington Industries' profit in its June27 third quarter rose 28%, the company said net income washeld down by a $10.9 million after-tax charge.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    6 Firms                       1987       1986       Chg    Belding Heminway              1,347        808     + 67    Burlington Indus             17,883     14,015     + 28    Fieldcrest Cannon             1,917      4,833     - 60    Springs Inds                 12,642      4,532     +179    Stevens J P andamp; Co             11,034      9,675     + 14    West Point-Pepperell         12,173      9,037     + 35    TOTAL                        56,996     42,900     + 33   THRIFT INSTITUTIONS   The group's total profits were sharply depressed by a bigloss at Financial Corp. of America, caused mostly by a $165.5million increase in its loan-loss reserves. In addition,thrifts that wrote off their investments in the insolventFederal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. generally reportedlower earnings; those that didn't take the write-off --instead awaiting a government recapitalization measure --reported modest gains. The FSLIC write-offs cost FinancialCorp. $23 million and Ahmanson $12.8 million after taxes; thewrite-offs depressed net of other thrifts by $5 million orless. Among the thrifts that declined to write off theirFSLIC investments, Great Western would have had its netreduced $27 million by such write-offs, CalFed by $8.9million, Great American by $4 million and Gibraltar by $3.9million. The group's profits also were held down by theabsence of big gains from the sale of loans andmortgage-backed securities, which had bolstered year-earlierprofits. Robert G. Hottensen Jr., a Goldman Sachs analyst,expects third-quarter profit to be &quot;flat to only nominallyup&quot; from year-earlier levels because of smaller gains on suchsales. CityFed took a $14.5 million write-down of mortgagesheld for sale in the latest quarter, while First Federal ofMichigan had a year-earlier charge of $13.8 million for earlyrepayment of Federal Home Loan Bank advances.                                2nd Qtr    2nd Qtr       %    13 Firms                      1987       1986       Chg    AhmansonHFandamp;Co                32,273     76,591     - 58    CalFed Inc                   48,200     44,500     +  8    CityFed Financial            -1,981     20,187      ...

Goodyear had a $13.6million after-tax gain from asset sales. But DayInternational's fiscal second quarter included an $8 millionpretax charge for restructuring costs. Modest increases intire prices seem to be holding. &quot;It's a firmer market than weexpected, the best in years,&quot; says James A. Bailey, executivevice president of Goodyear's North American tire division.Shipments of replacement light-truck and passenger tiresremain strong, and the weak dollar makes imports moreexpensive and raises overseas profits when translated intodollars.
