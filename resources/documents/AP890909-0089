Vic Fazio, D-Calif.``It is beginning to be seen in perspective now. People believe itwas overblown.''   ``It's an abstraction to most people,'' said Rep. Phil Crane,R-Ill. ``Who personally has ever witnessed a flag burning? ... Itdoes not have, except through some veterans' organizations, aspecific hard-core constituency.''   Even so, leadership aides in both parties predict lawmakers willmove quickly this fall to pass legislation to outlaw burning andother acts of flag desecration, if only to take the steam out ofPresident Bush's drive for constitutional amendment to do the samething.   Top Democratic leaders in both houses back the legislativeapproach, in part out of fear that outright opposition would leavethem vulnerable to criticism from Republicans in the 1990congressional elections.   The issue arose when the Supreme Court ruled June 21 that burningthe flag could be free speech protected by the First Amendment. Thattriggered a wave of outrage, including Bush's call for aconstitutional amendment. Many veterans groups, including theAmerican Legion, want the change written into the Bill of Rights tomake it safe from any future court ruling.   The House will be the first to address the issue when it takes upa bill on Tuesday that would impose fines and up to a year in prisonfor physically desecrating a flag, an approach supporters say shouldbe at least tried before seeking to amend the Constitution.   Lawmakers just back to work after a month at home agreed passionson the issue have cooled over the summer.   ``I did not have one single person bring it up,'' said Rep. BerylAnthony, D-Ark.   ``I think the momentum to build up to a constitutional amendmenthas diminished substantially,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., whoheld 63 meetings with constituents during August. ``A statute willsuffice. Even veterans' groups ... are telling me right now theythink a statute's sufficient.''   Rep. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, who supports the amendment, agreed.``If a statute can address the problem, that will take care of theissue,'' she said.   But Republicans are betting lawmakers will vote for any measurethat would protect the flag, fearing any ``no'' vote could be turnedby an opponent into a 30-second political attack ad.   ``I'm going to support whatever comes up,'' said Rep. ClaudeHarris, D-Ala. ``I'm not going to be in a situation of votingagainst anything that would punish someone for violating the flag,whether it be a statute or a constitutional amendment.''   ``My sense is that people are concerned that Republicans will usethe issue in the same unprincipled but politically effective way inwhich they used the Pledge'' of Allegiance against Democraticpresidential nominee Michael Dukakis last year, said Rep. Ted Weiss,D-N.Y.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, already haspromised a vote on legislation as well as the amendment in October.And late last week, House Democratic leaders were discussing asimilar agreement with Republicans.   Democratic sources said leaders in the majority were prepared toallow a House vote on a constitutional amendment sometime after theSenate acts on it if Republicans would support the statutory measurethat comes to the floor Tuesday.   The measure was tentatively scheduled to be brought up under anexpedited process normally reserved for non-controversial bills.That means it would require a two-thirds majority to pass.   Opponents of the constitutional amendment, including HouseSpeaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., apparently are gambling passage ofstatutory flag protection will defuse the issue _ and indeed, manylawmakers said that's exactly what they heard back home.   ``They (constituents) want to stop the burning of the Americanflag, and they don't care how we do it up there in Congress,'' saidRep. Sonny Montgomery, D-Miss., a primary sponsor of theconstitutional amendment.</TEXT></DOC>
