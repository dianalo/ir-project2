The Federal Aviation Administration said the order requiringaltitude signalling devices on all planes flying within 30 miles ofthe most congested airports ``should significantly reduce the dangerof midair collisions.'' The FAA rule took effect Saturday.   But pilots and small plane owners say it will clutter air trafficcontrol screens, effectively bar 40,000 planes from 1,200 airportsnear big cities, and do nothing to enhance safety.   Under the rule, only planes carrying Mode C transponders can flywithin 30 miles of the nation's 27 most congested airports. Mode Csends a signal telling air traffic controllers where the plane isand at what altitude.   The transponders have always been required for planes that usemajor airports, but they have not previously been required forlow-altitude flights past the airports or for access to smallergeneral aviation airports that fall within the 30-mile ``veils.''   Patricia Weil, spokeswoman for the 290,000-member Aircraft Ownersand Pilots Association, said the order will effectively putoff-limits to non-Mode C planes all the airports in the Los Angelesbasin, scores of public and private airports and helipads aroundWashington, D.C., and hundreds of airports near other cities thatserve vital business and medical air traffic.   ``We can no longer fly under the wedding cake,'' Ms. Weil said,referring to the air traffic control rules that previously allowedsmall planes to fly within progressively lower altitudes as they getnearer major airports, like flying under an inverted wedding cake.   Jerry Walbrun of the 125,000-member Experimental AircraftAssociation of Oshkosh, Wisc., said the rule will overburden airtraffic controllers.   ``It's a little bit like trying to use computers to controltraffic in downtown Washington,'' he said, adding that the trafficcontrol system is not geared to watch the scores of small planesflying well below the altitude of major airliners.   ``The FAA has imposed a situation that will not enhance safetyand put it into effect more quickly than their own system canhandle,'' he said.   Many pilots are faced with the prospect of either spending from$900 to $2,000 to equip their planes with Mode C or move theirairplanes to more-remote airports.   The FAA, in justifying the new rule, said it ``will have a majorpositive impact on safety by providing air traffic controllers withvital altitude information so potential conflicts between aircraftcan be safely resolved.''   But last week, 18 House members sent a letter to TransportationSecretary Samuel Skinner calling for him to delay implementation ofthe rule until provisions can be made for access to smaller airportsthat fall within the veils.   ``The fact is that safety does not require universal installmentof automatic altitude reporting transponders,'' the lawmakers said,adding that government should not impose unnecessary regulationsthat impose ``great cost on private individuals.''   The Congress members said that if the Mode C requirement werelimited to areas around major airports that are reached by radar,rather than the arbitrary 30-mile limit, it would open up 600 to 700smaller general aviation airports.   The FAA has exempted from the rule antique aircraft, balloons andother aircraft without electrical systems necessary to runtransponders.   The agency also acknowledged last week that many aircraft ownersmay have postponed purchase of Mode C units awaiting the outcome ofan aircraft owners' challenge to the rule, which the FAA rejectedonly two weeks ago.   To accommodate them, 90-day exemptions are being granted over thephone. Pilots who want to fly within a restricted area can call airtraffic control authorities at the individual airport to get theexemptions.   The FAA also indicated longer exemptions could be given for someoperators who regularly use airports on the fringes of the veil inareas without radar coverage or for aircraft that cannot be equippedto handle Mode C, but written requests are required.   The transponder rule is to be extended to 111 additional airportsat the end of next year.   Aviation maps printed by the Commerce Department already show theforbidden zones, so pilots have known for some time where they won'tbe able to fly.</TEXT></DOC>
