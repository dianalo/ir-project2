Retail sales rose 0.5% to $134.02 billion in July, with much of the growth coming from solid auto sales, the Commerce Department reported. Excluding the 1.9% growth in the auto sector, sales rose only 0.1%. The weakness came from declines in building materials and home furnishings as well as from slow sales of nondurable goods. July sales were up 5.5% from a year earlier.    &quot;The composition of economic growth is just what the Federal Reserve wants -- with the growth led by exports, but consumer spending growing slowly,&quot; said Joan Schneider, senior economist at Continental Illinois Bank, Chicago. The Fed has been concerned that strength in the economy from vigorous exports may translate into rapid rises in consumer spending and inflation. It raised interest rates this week to control that possibility.    Apparel specialty stores had a healthy 1.6% sales rise in July, their third consecutive increase after some months of sluggish growth.    &quot;I think the mismatch between what consumers wanted and what stores had anticipated (consumers would want) has been corrected,&quot; said Rosalind Wells of the National Retail Merchants Association. As more stores bring in the fall season's stock, retailers should see much stronger sales, she said.    Many economists have been concerned that recent data showing strong employment and rising wages may lead to a surge in consumer spending and an increase in inflationary pressures. The moderate sales increase for July, however, somewhat allays this fear, some economists said.    The rise in sales also appears likely to please those who have worried that consumer spending may be declining. Retail sales figures over the past three months, economists said, show consumer spending continuing at the same moderate pace as in the early months of this year.    The Commerce Department report doesn't reflect consumer spending on services, which continues to be strong. The sluggish growth in retail sales, therefore, isn't likely to translate into an increase in the personal savings rate. &quot;You are not going to see any improvement in the savings rate, and possibly some erosion,&quot; said David Hale, an economist at Kemper Financial Services.    The July sales increase follows a downward revision in the June increase to 0.4% from 0.5%. The May increase, initially reported at 0.1% and then revised to 0.3%, was revised again to 0.8%.    Sales of durables rose 0.7% in July, compared with a June increase of 0.6%. Nondurable goods saw a 0.4% increase in sales after a June increase of 0.3%. Durable goods generally are those intended to last three years or longer.    All the figures are adjusted for seasonal variations but not for inflation. </TEXT></DOC>
