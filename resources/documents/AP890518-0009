A State Department official told the committee that themonitoring and enforcement agreement represented an ``importantfirst step'' toward regulating the driftnet fishing fleets in theNorth Pacific.   But a Commerce Department official said he thought the treatywas inadequate and contained too many unanswered questions.   Japan, along with South Korea and Taiwan, faces possible tradesanctions on its fishery products imported into the United Statesif driftnet agreements aren't signed by June 29.   Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher will have to decide whetherthe treaty with the Japanese meets the requirements of the DriftnetAct passed by Congress in 1987 or whether the administration shouldpursue trade sanctions.   Lawmakers from Washington state, Alaska and Oregon have urgedthe administration to renegotiate the treaty, while the Northwestfishing industry and environmentalists have been highly critical ofthe agreement, which covers only one year.   An estimated 700 to 1,000 fishing vessels from Japan, SouthKorea and Taiwan use driftnets in the North Pacific, ostensibly tocatch squid. The monofilament, small-mesh nets, which can stretchmore than 30 miles in length, hang in the water snaring virtuallyany mammal, bird or fish that come in contact with them.   On any given day, the nets can cover more than 30,000 miles ofocean.   U.S. fishermen insist the driftnet fleets are intentionallycatching salmon under the guise of harvesting squid. Salmon runs inAlaska, Washington state and Oregon have dropped sharply as aresult of the illegal fishing, they say.   Environmentalists charge that driftnets kill thousands ofporpoises, seals, seabirds and other marine life annually.   The treaty would provide for 32 observers to be placed aboardthe 460 Japanese vessels that use driftnets, and increase from fourto five the number of Japanese patrol boats in the vast area wheredriftnet fishing is legal.   The Japanese refused to participate in a pilot program proposedby the United States to track their vessel locations by satellite,and indicated they were unilaterally expanding the legal driftnetfishing zone 120 miles north.   The legal zone was designed to keep the driftnet fleets wellaway from the traditional migration routes of North American salmon.   ``The driftnet agreement with Japan represents an importantfirst step in this process and, we hope, will be followed by theconclusion of driftnet monitoring and enforcement programs for thedriftnet fisheries of Korea and Taiwan as well,'' said RichardSmith, a principal deputy assistant secretary at the StateDepartment.   ``If that happens, the first body bag would carry the remains ofthe best monitoring agreement we've ever had,'' said Smith, addingthat while he was aware of the ``frustration and anger''surrounding the driftnet issue, the treaty was the ``path ofcooperation.''   State Department sources, who asked not to be named, saiddisagreement exists within the department over whether the treatyshould be signed to avoid a possible trade war or whether it wastime to get tough with the Japanese.   William Evans, a Commerce Department under secretary for oceansand atmosphere, told the committee he was not satisfied with thetreaty.   ``I believe it falls way short of the mark,'' said Evans.</TEXT></DOC>
