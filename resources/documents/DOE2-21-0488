The original intent of the programwas to integrate approaches in chemistry, ocean transport, and biologicaluptake to quantify the variables that regulate biological availabilityof energy-effluent materials. Initial work was focused on the fate andeffects of copper. In later research, the authors examined the basicenvironmental variables controlling the bioavailability of energy-relatedcontaminants. They investigated how factors such as dissolved organiccompounds, suspended particles, and sediment binding affected chemicalspeciation and how chemical speciation, in turn, influenced the availabilityof metals and radionuclides to marine invertebrates. They developed ahydrodynamic model to predict sediment and contaminant transport, andthey quantified the bioconcentration of synthetic-fuel residuals in plankton.</TEXT></DOC>
