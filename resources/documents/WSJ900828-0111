The reversal decision, issued May 2 by three members ofthe appeals court, essentially gutted two major laws used bythe Securities and Exchange Commission and the JusticeDepartment in fighting insider trading. The U.S. SecondCircuit Court of Appeals typically doesn't grant a fullreview of decisions by its three-judge panels.</LP><TEXT>   In asking the court to rehear the appeal, the SEC said,&quot;The panel decision, unless set aside, could undermine theability of {authorities} . . . to police insider trading,which has been one of the most important areas ofsecurities-law enforcement in recent years.&quot;   The U.S. attorney's office, which made the formal requestfor a rehearing, said in its brief that the panel's &quot;decisionmay well be viewed by the securities industry as providing asafe harbor within which to trade on inside information.&quot;   Richard A. Kirby, the SEC's senior litigation counsel,called the decision to rehear the case &quot;a positive step forthe SEC.&quot;   The decision reversing Mr. Chestman's conviction focusedon two areas: whether a fiduciary duty has to be violated foran insider-trading law to apply, and whether someone whotrades on a stock tip violates the law if the tipper didn'tspecifically say that the information was confidential.   The appeals court announced that a majority of its judgeshad voted to reconsider the decision. Oral arguments on theappeal will be heard by the court at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9. Thecourt could decide to uphold the panel's decision, whichresulted in Mr. Chestman's release from prison, or it couldrule that the conviction before the trial judge was proper.   The court said it will address issues raised regarding asecurities regulation called Rule 14e-3, which makes it acrime to trade on misappropriated information involving atender offer. The SEC commonly relies on Rule 14e-3 inpursuing insider-trading cases against defendants who aren'tcompany insiders.   The court also will look at Rule 10b-5, which makes it acrime to trade on a stock tip that is nonpublic information.Law-enforcement officials said the earlier decision wouldprohibit the use of circumstantial evidence in showing thatsomeone who received a tip knew or should have known that thestock information was confidential.   Already the appeals-court panel's reversal of the Chestmanconviction has been cited in at least one lower-courtdecision in a federal insider-trading case. And ThomasNewkirk, the SEC's chief litigation counsel, said the panel'sdecision is being cited by defense attorneys in cases acrossthe U.S. In its brief, the SEC said, &quot;The impact of the paneldecision is enhanced by the pre-eminent role of this circuitin the development of the law of insider trading.&quot;   &quot;The original decision was potentially very damaging for&quot;the SEC's law-enforcement division, Mr. Newkirk said. &quot;Thefact that this circuit is where all our good cases havehistorically originated makes it even more important.&quot;   The court's agreement to review the reversal means thedecision now is not binding on federal district judges in thecircuit.   Mr. Chestman's attorney couldn't be reached for comment.   Mr. Chestman, formerly a broker with Gruntal andamp; Co., wasfound guilty in March 1989 of 31 counts related to allegedinsider trading in Waldbaum Inc. stock just before thecompany's takeover in 1986 by Great Atlantic andamp; Pacific TeaCo.   The trading was based on information that Mr. Chestmanreceived fourth-hand, from an in-law of Waldbaum'sthen-president. The court reversed the conviction on theground that Mr. Chestman hadn't been told that theinformation was confidential.</TEXT></DOC>
