The Bahamian facility has a capacity of 5.2million barrels, according to International Dunraine Ltd. ofToronto, the current owner.   Officials of the Toronto company confirmed Friday thatBolanter Corp., an affiliate of Saudi Arabian Oil Co., orSaudi Aramco, signed a letter of intent Dec. 9 to purchasethe South Riding Point oil transhipment and storage facilityfor $51 million. The parties are now working on a definitivepurchase agreement with an expected March 31 closing.   The storage unit is on Grand Bahama Island. &quot;It is thebest strategic location for supplying the U.S. East or GulfCoasts,&quot; said Stephen R. Dattels, president of Dunraine.   Saudi Arabia already stores some of its oil in leasedspace in the Caribbean area. It currently leases some threemillion barrels of the capacity of the Bahamas facility.Additionally, it is understood to lease a total of aboutseven million barrels of storage space on the islands ofAruba and St. Lucia. And the kingdom frequently uses oiltankers for storage, parked near its major markets, althoughmuch of these floating inventories have been sold since theend of the Persian Gulf War.   Also, Saudi Arabia recently agreed to acquire land tankagein the Netherlands. It leases tanks in Egypt, and it is saidto be planning to lease huge storage facilities to be builtin South Korea. Until now, however, the Saudis have beenunsuccessful in their search for ownership of a major crudefacility near the U.S.   On several occasions, industry sources say, the Saudishave been in bidding wars for Caribbean storage space. Theylost out to Venezuela's national oil company in efforts tobuy the Bonaire terminal from Northville Industries and theBorco facility, which is also on Grand Bahama Island, fromChevron Corp. But they may have beaten out National IranianOil Co. in the bidding to acquire the Dunraine facility,according to the Energy Compass.   The Compass has been following Saudi efforts to acquireCaribbean storage. Such facilities close to markets areparticularly valuable for so-called long-haul Middle Eastexporters, it noted, because oil prices can changesignificantly during a 45-day to 60-day voyage. &quot;Theacquisition will bolster {the kingdom's} alreadywell-established marketing ploy of positioning crude oilclose to consumer markets -- in this case, to delivershort-haul cargoes to U.S. East Coast customers,&quot; theLondon-based publication added.   The high price the Saudis will pay for the Bahamas storage-- essentially $10 a barrel -- indicates the facility'sstrategic importance for the kingdom as competition for U.S.market share heats up among various Middle Eastern producers,according to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report. Itadded that sources said Saudi Arabia has plans to double thecapacity of the Bahamian terminal to about 10 millionbarrels.   In the wake of the Persian Gulf crisis, Saudi Arabia,which now produces some 8.5 million barrels a day, hasregained its former position as the leading oil supplier tothe U.S. The American Petroleum Institute will release itslatest figures this week on the breakout of sources of U.S.oil imports. The new figures will show that for theJanuary-September period, the latest months available, SaudiArabia was ranked No. 1, accounting for an average 1,830,000barrels a day, or 24%, of U.S. oil imports.</TEXT></DOC>
