The most recent has been the article by Michael Ledeen (&quot;How the Iran Initiative Went Wrong,&quot; editorial page, Aug. 10).    At the outset Mr. Ledeen is right. The objective of all those within the government who were involved was to determine whether there was anyone in Iran in authority with an interest in working for a more sensible post-Khomeini regime. The trouble was that our only channel through which to search for such an individual or group was through Mr. Ghorbanifar. Now it is true that Mr. Ghorbanifar presented a one-bodied, so-called moderate in the fall of 1985 to the Israelis and perhaps to Mr. Ledeen. In retrospect, this reported moderate was very likely bait and nothing more, for it is undeniable that when I stated to Mr. Ghorbanifar in my meeting with him in London in December 1985 that we were open to holding a meeting with the same so-called moderate but would not pay a price for it in arms or anything else, he refused and insisted that nothing could be done until more arms were produced. I broke off the talks, came home and recommended to the president that he have nothing more to do with Mr. Ghorbanifar. This has been corroborated by several other participants in the meeting.    There are two other curious facets to Mr. Ledeen's article. First, that contrary to his protestations of being against dealing in arms for hostages, it was Mr. Ledeen -- alone, no one else -- who consistently brought to me the most outrageous Iranian demands for arms. I consistently refused to consider them. Second, Mr. Ledeen acknowledged this fact -- that I was consistently against arms-for-hostages -- in a conversation with me last Nov. 21 at his home. Lt. Col. North was present and stated that his notes of the December 1985 meeting with Mr. Ghorbanifar confirmed this.    A sober look at the facts surrounding the Iranian initiative makes clear the following facts: It was worth a try to find out if there were any sensible Iranians in a position to influence change with whom we could cooperate. We tried, but the price was always arms, and after showing a little ankle, the &quot;moderate Iranians&quot; never showed up again. So it didn't work. Let's don't try to pretend otherwise.
