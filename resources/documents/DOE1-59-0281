Laboratorycircumstances, spall during thermal cycling. To date it has been difficultto identify active material originating from the oxidation product ofthe cladding alloy in the cooling circuit. In an attempt to solve thisproblem we have set out to characterise fully a sample of oxide fromthis source and work is in progress to obtain suitable oxide samplesfrom the surface of a 20%Cr/25%Ni/Nb stainless steel. In view of itshigh sensitivity and the ability to obtain chemical information fromrelatively small areas we have sought to use Secondary Ion Mass Spectroscopy(SIMS).</TEXT></DOC>
