The year-earlier loss was $14.2 million. Revenue rose to $49.3 million from $42.1 million. For the year ended Nov. 2, Intermedics had net income of $6.2 million, or 57 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $20 million a year ago. Revenue in the year climbed 8% to $178.3 million from $164.9 million a year earlier.    The year's results include profit from discontinued operations of $23.8 million, primarily from the sale of a unit. With the proceeds, Intermedics said it repaid most of its major debt and also received commitments for a secured credit line of as much as $30 million.    The medical products concern, which has been battered by heavy losses, reiterated that it expects to post a profit for fiscal 1987, largely because of corporate restructuring and the repayment of debt. The company said it has repaid $15 million of outstanding debt owed to closely held May Partnership, an Atlanta-based investment partnership.    Intermedics' fourth-quarter loss from continuing operations was $22.1 million, compared with a year-ago loss from continuing operations of $13.3 million.    For the year, Intermedics posted a loss from continuing operations of $17.7 million, compared with a loss from continuing lines of $19.6 million a year earlier.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Intermedics closed at $16.75 a share, up $1. </TEXT></DOC>
