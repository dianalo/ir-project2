A rally planned for Wednesday in support of the striking workersdid not take place. Demonstrations in Nicaragua are banned unlessthey have government approval.   Authorities told the leaders only that the police action was``to frustrate an attempt to violate the laws of the country,''Jaime Bonilla of the Independent Liberal Party said.   The Interior Ministry on Tuesday barred the privately ownedRadio Mundial and the Roman Catholic station Radio Catolica frombroadcasting news for eight days. It also closed Radio Corporacionfor 24 hours for airing ``false news'' about the strike.   Leaders from 14 opposition parties, ranging from the Communiststo the rightist Social Christians, had gathered at the office ofthe Social Democrat Party.   They were to go from there to the General Workers Federationbuilding a mile away, where more than 30 workers were staging ahunger strike for higher pay. The strike continued today for a 10thday.   As the leaders were about to leave, police in military andcivilian vehicles took them into custody, Lorena Obando, a memberof the Social Democrat Party, said.   Alma Morales, an Interior Ministry spokeswoman, said the group``was invited'' to meet with Commander Doris Tijerino, chief of theSandinista police.   Police grabbed two others _ Social Christian leaders AgustinJarquin Anaya and Armando Guadamuz _ near the federation buildingand pushed them into a police vehicle. Guadamuz had been speakingwith journalists a block from the building.   ``This is the repressive custom of the (Sandinista) Front,''Guadamuz said before police led him away. ``They are violent bytradition.''   Police cordoned off the federation building.   At a news conference late Wednesday, Bonilla said oppositionleaders who are in the National Assembly and have immunity fromprosecution were released before reaching a police station.   The rest, he said, ``were taken to a place called Palo Altowhere they asked us our complete names, home addresses, age,occupation and position in our political parties.   ``Some of us were taken to jails and others to interrogationrooms, which are more comfortable,'' Bonilla added.   Tijerino ordered them released, he said.   Javier Lopez, a high-ranking police official, was quoted innewspapers as saying the leaders were detained ``because they didnot have authorization to carry out that mobilization.''   It was unclear if he referred to the visit to the hungerstrikers or the planned rally.   Construction workers and car mechanics walked off their jobsFeb. 25 to demand higher salaries and better working conditions.The federation, a coalition of socialist unions, says 4,500 workersare striking. Interior Minister Tomas Borge has said there are only400 people off the job.   Erick Ramirez, leader of a faction of the Social ChristianParty, said the parties ``have been holding activities in favor ofthe workers on hunger strike because their demands are just andbecause of the difficult economic situation that the workers inthis country are living.''   Radio Catolica had been closed for almost two years for failingto broadcast Ortega's year-end message on Dec. 31, 1985. The onlyopposition newspaper, La Prensa, was closed June 26, 1986. Bothwere allowed to reopen last October.</TEXT></DOC>
