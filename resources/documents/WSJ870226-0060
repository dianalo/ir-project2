Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.) told SEC Chairman John Shad that he has received complaints that the agency will merely issue a report on its investigation rather than pursue &quot;members of the investment community&quot; involved in WPPSS bond offerings. &quot;If true,&quot; the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in a Feb. 10 letter, &quot;serious concerns are raised about the ability and willingness of the commission to vigorously enforce the federal securities laws.&quot;    The SEC's enforcement staff, meanwhile, appears to be leaning toward recommending that the five-member commission take some administrative action or file civil lawsuits. The staff has been reviewing the testimony of dozens of witnesses and drafting an investigative report on the 1983 financial fiasco, the biggest municipal bond default ever. The report is likely to be sent to Congress.    Last month, according to sources close to the investigation, SEC attorneys, including enforcement chief Gary Lynch, met with lawyers representing more than 30 potential defendants in the case. Some lawyers were asked to submit responses to possible allegations of securities fraud and other violations against their clients.    But it couldn't be determined which potential defendants received requests for so-called Wells submissions, or, in effect, rebuttal. Defendants in the case could include WPPSS bond underwriters, the bond-rating agencies, engineering and architectural firms, the supply system, its directors and its bond counsel.    Before the insider-trading scandal broke on Wall Street last year, Mr. Shad had called WPPSS &quot;the largest single investigation&quot; in the SEC's history. So far, the agency has only brought fraud charges against two minor bond houses.    Yesterday, William Kuehnle, the SEC attorney in charge of the investigation, was in Los Angeles and couldn't be reached. Mr. Lynch wouldn't comment on the status of the case or the likelihood of a staff recommendation for enforcement action.    The power system, often called Whoops, canceled its nuclear units No. 4 and No. 5 in early 1982. It defaulted on the bonds for the two units in mid-1983 after the Washington State Supreme Court ruled that participating utilities in the Pacific Northwest lacked legal authority to agree to repay the bonds.    But the SEC didn't limit its investigation to the bond offerings for units No. 4 and No. 5. In January 1984, Mr. Shad said the agency was looking at about 50 WPPSS bond offerings between 1973 and 1982, including those used to finance three other nuclear units. The agency issued subpoenas to six major Wall Street underwriters, several WPPSS officials and other participants in the nuclear projects.    The subpoenaed underwriters included Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner and Smith; Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co.; Goldman, Sachs and Co.; Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., First Boston Corp. and Salomon Brothers Inc. SEC officials said the subpoenas shouldn't be construed as a sign of any securities violations.    Whatever the commissioners' decision, it will have a strong bearing on the multibillion-dollar civil litigation pending in federal court in Seattle.    &quot;If they come down heavy on the defendants, it might help the psychology of the (bondholders') case,&quot; said Paul Bernstein, a New York attorney who represents a large bondholders group. SEC action might make WPPSS, underwriters and other defendants in the group's class-action suit more inclined to settle, he said. &quot;If the SEC doesn't find any wrongdoing, I believe they'll be in error,&quot; Mr. Bernstein asserted.    As of yesterday, proof-of-claim filings had been made by 26,809 investors in the defaulted bonds, a New York law firm representing plaintiffs said. The filings make the bondholders eligible for any settlement reached through the litigation.    In his letter to Mr. Shad, Rep. Dingell said &quot;serious questions&quot; have been raised about possible &quot;misrepresentations and omissions&quot; in WPPSS statements before the bond sales for units No. 4 and No. 5 and in credit analyses and other reports prepared by underwriters and other firms.    Rep. Dingell said research analysts at Merrill Lynch, the lead underwriter in three of the last five WPPSS bond sales for units No. 4 and No. 5, issued a &quot;critical&quot; report on the supply system in July 1981. &quot;But the firm's sales staff aggressively marketed the bonds, nonetheless,&quot; Rep. Dingell asserted in the letter.    In New York, Merrill Lynch spokesman James Flynn said the firm &quot;strongly denies any suggestion of impropriety or wrongdoing in connection with its actions regarding WPPSS bonds.&quot; He said the firm &quot;believes there is no basis for SEC action with respect to Merrill Lynch and other underwriters.&quot;    Even if the agency doesn't act, it is likely the SEC will report its findings to Congress, just as it did in 1975 after looking into New York City's financial crisis. That report chastised city officials and the city's bond counsel. The agency also issued a critical report on its investigation of the 1980 silver-market crisis, triggered by the speculation of the Hunt brothers.    Tomorrow is the last day that bondholders can join the lawsuit, which is pending in the federal district court of the Western district of Washington state. Trial is scheduled to begin Sept. 1, 1988.    The class consists of investors who purchased bonds for WPPSS's No. 4 and No. 5 units between Feb. 23, 1977, when they were first sold, and Jan. 22, 1982, when the projects were terminated.    To participate, investors must file the proof-of-claim forms with the action's sponsor, Supply System Securities Litigation Group, based in New York.    The suit names, among others, WPPSS, the Bonneville Power Administration, two credit-rating agencies, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. and Moody's Investors Service Inc.; the 88 utilities that participated in terminated projects, and WPPSS's financial advisers and investment bankers.    ---   Alexandra Peers in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
