<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0693 </DOCNO><TEXT>For realization of power consumption levelling, a control system is investigatedfor the practical applications, by which system consumer loads are collectedand controlled by a power company. The investigation is a three-yearscheme of 1986 to 1988, in 1986, and outline and a demonstration-systemfor the control system were designed. In the outline design, electricwater heaters and heat-storage type air conditioners exemplified as anapparatus to be load-collection controlled, were investigated or estimatedon the way that these apparatus are paractically used, and the usefulnessof the collection control system to these apparatus. Further, developmentsof the automation systems and concerned apparatus for consumers wereinvestigated. For multi-purpose utilization of the collection-controlsystem, i.e., for application of the system to control of dispersed powerplants, automatic control of distribution switches, automatic energydetection and so forth, it has been revealed that emploment of a bilateralcommunication system using optical fibers or coaxial cables should bepreferred. Based on the investigation results, an outline of the collection-operationsystem for a 320,000 consumers model-office was designed.</TEXT></DOC>
