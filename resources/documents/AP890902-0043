Alano said immigration agents arrested Robert Otto RosenthalFriday at a house on the outskirts of Opol, a town in MisamisOriental province, about 540 miles southeast of Manila.   Rosenthal, 51, was charged in the U.S. District Court of theeastern district of Missouri last March with transporting cocainefrom Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to St. Louis on five occasions betweenSeptember 1987 and November 1988, records showed.   The U.S. Embassy had canceled Rosenthal's passport and he was tobe deported today, Alano said.   The statement did not say how long Rosenthal had been in thePhilippines, and details about his hometown and state wereunavailable.   Alano said immigration agents will concentrate on arrestingforeigners belonging to syndicates involved in drugs, prostitution,gun smuggling and fake travel documents.   Rosenthal's arrest followed raids on the island of Cebu and inManila.   In Cebu island, two West Germans were arrested Friday on chargesthey were members of an international drug syndicate, said DaniloAlmeda, regional immigration chief.   Almeda said agents seized a half pound of marijuana from MarkosManfred Riedel, 26, and Wolfgang Christian Gerhard Kuhn, 32, duringa raid on a house in the village of Liloan, about 390 milessoutheast of Manila.   Riedel and Kuhn were to be flown to Manila to face deportationproceedings, authorities said.   Almeda said authorities were investigating whether yachts werebeing used to smuggle marijuana from Cebu to foreign countries. TheGermans arrived in Cebu by yacht last March, authorities said.
