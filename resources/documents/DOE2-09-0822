Air samples and general-work-practice evaluationswere made at four of ten garages during brake jobs on six different vehiclesto determine whether dust-control measures in use were sufficient tolimit the potential for exposure to asbestos dust to workers. A solventspray was used to suppress brake dust, being applied to all exposed surfacesafter the brake drum has been removed. In one garage a mechanic appliedthe solvent by the wet-brush method, while in the other garages the solventwas sprayed on the exposed surfaces. Asbestos concentrations in personalsamples for the five vehicles having brake drums less than or equal to12 inches in diameter was 0.046 fibers/cubic centimeter (f/cc). The greatestpotential exposure occurred during spraying of brake components and drums.The second-highest dust levels occurred during loosening and tighteningof lug bolts with a pneumatic air wrench. The study demonstrates theeffectiveness of the wet spray and wet brush methods for containing asbestosexposures.</TEXT></DOC>
