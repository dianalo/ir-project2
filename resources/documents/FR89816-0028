The final rule is published elsewhere in thisissue. The final rule was issued to satisfy the mandate of section 221which requires the FDIC to prescribe initial regulations under that sectionof the date of enactment of FIRRE. Because the FDIC acted under a statutorydeadline, the final rule established only those requirements that wereconsidered to be the minimum necessary to comply with FIRRE.The FDIC is considering additional amendments to its regulation regardingadvertisement of membership. More specifically, the FDIC is consideringrequiring each insured savings association to display a statement in itsadvertisements to the effect that its deposits are federally insured. Inthe alternative, the FDIC is considering eliminating its current regulationwhich requires an insured bank to display an official advertising statementin its advertisement. Comment is invited on the extension or the eliminationof this requirement. In addition, comment is invited on the need for regulationsimplementing section 222 of FIRRE. Section 222 of FIRRE provides that anysavings association, the deposits of which are not insured by the FDIC,shall disclose clearly and conspicuously in periodic statements of accountand in all advertising that the savings association's deposits are notfederally insured.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Comments must be submitted on or before October 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Send comments to Hoyle L.

Section 221 requires each insured savings associationto display at each place of business maintained by the association a prescribedsign notifying the public of deposit insurance coverage (``savings associationsign''). FIRRE provides that, not later than 30 days after the date ofenactment of FIRRE, each insured bank shall display at each place of businessmaintained by such bank a sign notifying the public of deposit insurancecoverage. Insured banks have the option of displaying the official sign(``bank sign'') required by FDIC regulation in effect on January 1, 1989,or the savings association.The FDIC is required to prescribe regulations to carry out the purposesof section 221 of FIRRE, including regulations governing the manner ofdisplay or use of such signs. Accordingly, the FDIC has issued a finalrule published elsewhere in this issue prescribing the sign insured savingsassociations must display and the locations where the sign must be displayed.The final rule provides that insured banks must display the official banksign or the official savings association sign prescribed for savings associations.Insured savings associations are not permitted to display the bank sign.<ITAG tagnum="84">Official Advertising Statement</ITAG>Prior to the enactment of FIRRE, section 18 of the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct specifically required an insured bank to include in advertisementsa statement to the effect that its deposits were insured by the FDIC. FIRREdoes not retain this specific requirement. It appears the FDIC has theauthority to retain its regulation requiring insured banks to include thecurrently prescribed statement in advertisements and to extend similarrequirements to insured saving associations. Since section 18 of the FederalDeposit Insurance Act as amended by FIRRE no longer mandates a statementof insurance coverage in advertisements, however, the FDIC believes itis appropriate at this time to review the benefits and costs of such arequirement. The FDIC therefore invites comments on the benefits of requiringinsured savings associations to display a notice of deposit insurance coveragein advertisements as insured banks are currently required to do by regulationor, in the alternative, eliminating the current requirement for insuredbanks.<ITAG tagnum="84">Advertisement of Uninsured Savings Associations</ITAG>Section 222 of FIRRE adds a new section 28 to the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct. Subsection (h) of section 28 provides that any savings associationthe deposits of which are not insured under the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct shall disclose clearly and conspicuously in periodic statements ofaccount and in all advertising that the savings association's depositsare not federally insured. Since the FDIC is considering the merits ofan official advertising statement of deposit insurance for insured depositoryinstitutions, it is appropriate to consider the need for regulations implementingsubsection 28(h). Comment is therefore solicited on the need for, and theproper scope of, regulations implementing subsection 28(h).<ITAG tagnum="20">(12 U.S.C. 1819; 12 U.S.C. 1828(a); sec. 222 of the Financial InstitutionsReform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By order of the Board of Directors.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Washington, DC, this ninth day of August, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Hoyle L.
