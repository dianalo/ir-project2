with44MB hard disk, monochrome monitor, DOS 3.3, $2,343; with VGA monitor,$2,899.andM;In Short: The Spear 386/16SX is very competitively priced and comesconfigured just about any way you want, with hand disk options up to 600MB.andO;It's highly expandable and sports better-than-average processor performance.andO;An overall smart buy.andP;  The Spear 386/16SX computer comes in just about anyconfiguration you could ask for, at a price that makes it one of the bestbuys around.andP;  The standard, stripped-down configuration is only $1,659, andwith VGA graphics and a 44MB hard disk it costs only $2,899.andP;  Add to this thegood processor performance, plus on-site service for only $45, and you have avery attractive system.andM;The Spear's case is somewhat smaller than a traditional IBM AT.andP;  It measuresonly 6.25 by 17 by 16.5 inches (HWD).andP;  The front panel allows access to twoof the three half-height drive bays, all stacked on the right side.andP;  You canget a large-chasis model of the computer--for $30 more--with five drive bays.andO;That model plumps out to 21.2 inches wide and stands almost half an inchtaller than the standard version.andP;  Right next to the drive bays on the frontis a pull-down door that protects the reset and speaker on/off buttons.andO;Having the reset button in a covered compartment is a good idea--you can'thit it by accident.andP;  On the other side of this compartment is the lock andthe LED lights.andP;  The bottom of the panel is used to vent the system'sinnards.andM;There isn't much excess room inside the Spear because of its compact design.andO;The ribbon cables connecting the hard and floppy disk drives to thecontroller are stuffed in between the drive bays and the 200-watt powersupply.andP;  In the model we tested, the controller, from Scientific MicroSystems, used an ST-506/412 MFM interface.andP;  The hard disk was from Toshibaand formatted to 44.7MB with a 23-milli-second random access time.andP;  The harddisk choices are hardly limiting; they range from 20MB all the way up to a600MB ESDI drive.andP;  The hard disk we tested cost $470, while a 160MBMicropolis costs $1,667 with the controller and the 600MB Maxtor costs $3,600with the controller.andM;The basic configuration for the Spear doesn't include a hard disk, althoughit does include an MFM floppy/hard disk controller with 1:1 interleave.andP;  Alsoabsent are a video controller and a monitor.andP;  For the $1,659 you get 1MB ofRAM, a 1.2MB 5-1/4-inch floppy disk drive, a serial and a parallel port, anEnhanced-style keyboard, and a clock/calendar.andP;  The processor runs at 16MHzor 8MHz, controlled by pressing Ctrl-Alt along with either the numeric Plusor Minus Key.andP;  The keyboard has a somewhat flat, unresponsive feel; it makesvery little sound when you type.andM;The Spear comes with eight expansion slots.andP;  Two are 8-bit, four are 16-bit,and two are high-speed, proprietary 16-bit slots.andP;  The high-speed slots canbe used for 8MB memory expansion cards that will bring the total memory ofthe system up to 18MB including the 2MB of RAM on the motherboard.andP;  Since thehigh-speed memory cards run at 16 MHz like the processor, they have zero waitstates.andP;  The motherboard RAM is arranged in two banks of 4-by-256-kilobit DIPchips that run at 80 nanoseconds with zero wait states as well.andP;  Another bankof 1-by-256-kilobit chips are there for parity.andP;  The Spear uses a pagemodememory scheme.andM;The motherboard used by Spear is a proprietary design by Everex.andP;  It uses oneVLSI for the basic system logic.andP;  The 80386SX processor is a square chipabout the size of a thumbnail.andP;  The rest of the board is populated withdiscrete logic chips, not too spread out because of the smaller footprint ofthe machine.andP;  A socket for the 80387SX math coprocessor resides in the middleof the board next to the processor.andM;Graphics is another matter of choice for the buyer.andP;  You can get a manochromemonitor for $79 or just about any other kind of monitor up to VGA.andP;  Thesystem we tested had a Tatung CM-1496 VGA monitor that goes for $428.andP;  Itsresolution is 640 by 480, and amber, green, white-on-blue, or white-on-blacktext can be selected from the front.andP;  The contrast and brightness controlshave a wide range of response.andP;  Unfortunately, they are not on the front ofthe monitor--you have to reach around to the left side toward the top.andP;  Theon/off switch is on the other side in about the same position.andM;The VGA card in our test model was an ATI Elan Plus 8-bit adapter with 512Kof video memory; it cost $270.andP;  It came in very slow on our benchmark tests:Direct to Screen access took 5.49 seconds, for example.andP;  But Spear alsocarries the much faster Paradise 16-bit VGA card for $367.andM;The Spear SX computer has a typical 1-year warranty.andP;  Fulfillment of thiswarranty can be through the mail, or by on-site service from NationalComputer Services, at a cost of $45 for the whole year.andP;  The convenience ofthis service is well worth the minimal fee.andM;In addition to the options already mentioned, Spear sells OS/2 or DOS, anumber of tape backup units (as high as 125MB), modems, a 150-watt powersupply, disk cache software, and more.andP;  With this wide selection of options,there is no such thing as a standard configuration--you can customize thecomputer to suit your needs.andP;  Given the excellent prices Spear offers, andthe respectable performance of the processor, there are quite a few reasonsto take a good look at this system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
