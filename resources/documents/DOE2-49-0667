Rooms within buildings are subject to IP 54 and IP 43 protectiondegrees, i.e. electrical installations in rooms (wiring, sockets, switches,electrical machines, resistors, measuring equipment etc.) must preventdust build-up, overheating and electric conductivity of dust. Work placesin open air are subject to a lower IP 4 X protection degree. The TGL34813 standard will also be applied for electrical installations in opencoal storage facilities. Diagrams for probability of brown coal dustignition are provided.</TEXT></DOC>
