A short-term cloud hangs over the stock as analysts wring their hands: Perhaps the company will reach an expensive labor settlement, signaling that top managers are wimps who can't cut costs. Or maybe the company's 2 1/2-week-long strike will drag on, eroding Nynex's already unimpressive earnings.    A few analysts, however, praise Nynex for not caving in to its unions. Its tough bargaining stance &quot;is a good sign, to the extent that management is taking a firmer hand in controlling costs,&quot; says Frank Governali of First Boston. Nynex managers filling in for strikers have accepted the tough-guy attitude, trading the latest wisecrack: &quot;Which holiday will you be taking off? Thanksgiving or Christmas?&quot;    Nynex shares finished yesterday at 79 3/8, little changed from the 79 5/8 of Friday, Aug. 4, two days before the walkout began. The bears say Nynex has the worst record of any Baby Bell for controlling costs at its phone company operations. Second-quarter per-share earnings fell to $1.42 from $1.64, prompting many analysts to lower their full-year estimates. Mr. Governali, who cut his yearly estimate by 50 cents, to $6.05, figures the bulk of the bad news has passed, but says he suspects it is &quot;still too early to be bottom fishing&quot; for Nynex shares.    Joel Gross of Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette is more enthusiastic. &quot;The stock is real cheap,&quot; he says, Nynex's management &quot;is willing to admit it has problems,&quot; and its big capital projects to upgrade its network are nearly behind it. Mr. Gross says he will be happy if the company comes up with a reasonable wage settlement, say, a total of 11% to 12% over three years, roughly in line with other Bells' agreements. But &quot;if the strike goes on for weeks or months,&quot; he says he might cool to the stock. Robert Morris of Goldman Sachs says the strike shouldn't have any effect on 1989 earnings if it ends by Oct. 1. While Nynex isn't for an investor with a six-month horizon, it offers a &quot;longer-term opportunity,&quot; he says.    At the heart of the strike is Nynex's effort to shift some health-care costs to workers. The Communications Workers of America believed it had neatly sidestepped the issue three years ago, when it agreed to a contract provision that postponed until this summer employee contributions to health care. The union believed that the cost-sharing wouldn't go into effect until the contract expired on Aug. 5, and that the provision thus was moot. Nynex argued successfully in court that the cost-sharing mechanism -- it ended up as a $10.27 weekly deduction from each union-represented employee's pay -- went into effect July 1. The matter is on appeal. Union members were angered by the dispute weeks before the strike began.    Other Bell companies have settled the health-care matter by agreeing to work with unions to set up &quot;preferred provider&quot; networks of physicians and hospitals that agree to limit cost increases, a step that Nynex appears to have nixed by insisting on the health-care cost-shifting plan in the 1986 contract. Nynex and its unions -- 40,000 employees are represented by the CWA and 20,000 more by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers -- seem intransigent. A brief meeting between company and CWA negotiators a week ago only managed to infuriate both sides.    A CWA picket in Westchester County, N.Y., died last week of injuries he suffered after falling off the front hood of a car as it slowly crossed the picket line. According to police, a car driven by an 18-year-old college student with a Nynex summer job may have bumped the picket, who then jumped onto the hood of her car, tried to bash in the windshield and lost his balance. The death was the first picket-line fatality for the 51-year-old union.    &quot;The longer the strike goes on, the greater the chance it could blow up in Nynex's face,&quot; says Jack Grubman of PaineWebber. Nynex, he says, needs politicians, regulators and consumer groups on its side to win a hoped-for rate increase. In early 1987, Nynex's New York Telephone unit began operating under an incentive regulation plan that removed a lid on profits but essentially required robust growth in the state economy and sharp cost-cutting at the phone company. Neither happened. New York Telephone has warned state regulators that it will ask them for a $900 million rate increase next February.    Nynex complains that the New York City area economy has been sluggish. It also frets that competition -- in the form of private, fiber-optic loops such as Teleport Communications -- is taking a significant bite out of Big Apple and Boston business. Mr. Grubman has little sympathy, saying: &quot;Southwestern Bell has been in a depression and has been able to eke out quarterly gains. Nynex ought to be able to do it, too.&quot;    Edward Greenberg of Morgan Stanley says he still finds Nynex attractive, because it has been selling at a relatively low multiple. Nynex recently has traded at around 13 times earnings, compared with 15 for Pacific Telesis and 14 for Southwestern Bell, Bell Atlantic and BellSouth. He dismisses talk of any long-term fallout from the strike. &quot;It's New York,&quot; he says. &quot;Labor relations are different here.&quot;    ---   Nynex    (NYSE; Symbol: NYN)    Business: Telecommunications    Year ended Dec. 31, 1988:    Revenue: $12.66 billion    Earnings: $1.32 billion    Second quarter, June 30, 1989:    Per-share earnings: $1.42 vs. $1.64    Average daily trading volume:    343,440 shares    Common shares outstanding: 197 million </TEXT></DOC>
