Documents subpoenaed from Koch Industries show that the companyconsistently ended the year with hundreds of thousands more barrelsof oil than it pays for, investigators told a special panel of theSenate Select Committee on Indian Affairs.   A woman at Koch's public relations office in Wichita said nobodywas available immediately to comment on the testimony.   Although measurement difficulties make it normal for oilcompanies to pay for less oil than they actually take _ even up to12,000 barrels a year _ Koch documents showed the firm ended 1986with 803,874 excess barrels, 1987 with 671,144 excess barrels and1988 with 474,281 more barrels than it paid for, witnesses said.   Chris Tucker, an independent oil and gas expert, said normalprocedure is for oil companies to compensate for ``overages'' byshorting themselves in future purchases.   The volumes for the three years shown in the Koch documents wereworth about $12.1 million, $11.9 million and $7.1 million,respectively.   Many of the Koch oil purchases were made on Indian lands withroyalties from the oil due to Indian tribes or individual Indians.   Chuck Norman, an accountant for the special committee, said itis easy to steal from the Indians because nobody watches thepurchasers, like Koch, take oil from the tanks at the well.   Furthermore, witnesses said, substantial confusion exists amongfederal agencies about who is supposed to police the taking of oilfrom Indian lands.   Tucker said Koch used various means to mismeasure oil. He showeda videotape he secretly made of a Koch employee taking oil at aNorthern Ute Indian oil field in Utah. He said it showed that theemployee did not follow all the procedures necessary to accuratelymeasure the oil.   Under questioning, Norman said evidence was being gathered onother companies as well and would be turned over to authorities.   ``We are not a grand jury,'' said Sen. Dennis DeConcini,D-Ariz., the panel's chairman. ``We are attempting to zero in onthe problem and how it happens.''   In an interview before the hearings began, DeConcini and Sen.John McCain, R-Ariz., said the committee's findings will be turnedover to the Justice Department which could seek indictments.   ``This thing is a mammoth problem,'' said DeConcini. ``If we'dhad another year we may have found more.''   He said investigators hid behind bushes in the oil fields andsaw companies ``mismeasure'' the amount of oil they took from wells.   Many of the areas are so remote that no one supervises theaction, he said.   The senators said none of the top seven oil corporations isinvolved, though the ones that are involved are multimillion-dollaroperations. They are mostly independent, ``middle-level''companies, they said.   Earl Ross, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, saidnone of the companies is a member of his organization, which is thelargest oil trade association in the country.   But he said the institute supplied the committee with technicalinformation on how to measure oil.   The hearings on oil companies this week and the Indian HealthService next week are the second segment of a series beingconducted by the special panel.   In February, the panel investigated contracting fraud, organizedcrime and child abuse on Indian reservations and among those doingbusiness with them.   The hearings on the health service are expected to reveal``gross mismanagement,'' said the senators.   ``It's a tragedy of all tragedies,'' said DeConcini, saying thehealth service provided care at ``less than the norm for thenation.''   McCain said the goal of the committee is to determine how wellthe federal government is fulfilling its responsibility to theIndians.   ``Our job is to review policies, programs and management so wecan recommend changes so problems won't happen again,'' he said.   DeConcini said he expected to have a report on all thecommittee's findings by October.</TEXT></DOC>
