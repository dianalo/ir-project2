<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0431 </DOCNO><TEXT>Like its predecessor, computed tomography (CT) magnetic resonance (MR)is a computer-based imaging technique that displays the body in thintomographic slices. However, unlike CT, which requires ionizing radiation,MR is based on an apparently safe interaction between radiowaves andhydrogen nuclei in the body in the presence of a strong magnetic field.Like CT, MRI provides exquisite anatomic detail with spatial resolutionof less than a millimeter. Unlike CT, MR allows imaging directly in threeorthogonal planes: transverse axial, sagittal, and coronal. In a comparisonof MR and CT in 400 consecutive cases of suspected disease in the brainand cervical cord, MR detected lesions missed on CT in 30 percent ofthe cases referred to a large community hospital over a 5-month period.For this reason, MR is rapidly being implemented at university medicalcenters, larger community hospitals, and free-standing clinics. In viewof the expected widespread use of these devices in the near future, itis incumbent on physicians to be familiar with the basic principles ofMRI and the technique's current clinical indications, particularly inthe central nervous system (CNS), where it is most useful. This chapterdescribes the fundamentals of interpreting the MR images and reviewsthe recognized non-neoplastic CNS applications for MRI at current levelsof technology.</TEXT></DOC>
