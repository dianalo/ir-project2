The National Highway Traffic Administration urged the recall``before the warmer summer vacation season begins'' in a letter to10 manufacturers even though the regulatory agency has notdetermined a safety problem exists.   A consumers group estimated up to 10,000 vehicles could berecalled. Precise figures on the number of vehicles wereunavailable.   The Center for Auto Safety, a consumers group often at odds withthe auto industry and regulators, said it has received 36 reportsof fuel spurting, resulting in seven fires, two injuries and onedeath, from motor homes built on modified P-30 chassis.   The spurting occurs when fuel leaks or sprays from the fillerneck, particularly after the gas cap is removed.   NHTSA's recall recommendation included motor homes built on 1984through 1986 GM P-30 chassis, equipped with a 454 V8 engine.   ``Our review of the available information indicates a potentialsafety defect exists in the fuel reservoir system'' of certainmotor homes, the NHTSA letter said.   The GM chassis had been modified in the fuel reservoir, exhaustsystem or vapor recovery system, the NHTSA letter said.   Dave McNitt, comptroller for Travelcraft, one of the companiessent the NHTSA letter, said the manufacturer believes its motorhomes are free from safety defects.   ``Basically, the only thing that is done to a unit isoccasionally the gas tank that comes with a unit is replaced by alarger tank,'' he said.   A study by the Center for Auto Safety concluded that 84 percentof fuel-spurting occurs between May 1 and October 1.   ``All motor home owners should be alert to the danger ofoverpressurized fuel and never remove the fuel cap if they hearhissing from the fuel tank,'' said Clarence Ditlow, the center'sdirector.   Robert Dewey of the center estimated 5,000 to 10,000 motor homescould be recalled, saying the number was imprecise because NHTSAwas in the early stages of its investigation.   NHTSA said the recall recommendation was sent to Travelcraft,Elkhart, Ind.; Holiday Rambler, Wakarusa, Ind.; Honey RV, Clifton,N.J.; Randamp;R Custom, South El Monte, Calif.; Tiffin Motorhomes Inc.,Red Bay, Ala.; Gulf Stream Coach Inc., Neppannee, Ind.; XplorerMotorhome Division of Frank Industries, Brown City, Mich.; MobileTraveler Inc., Junction City, Kan.; Coachmen Industries Inc.,Middlebury, Ind.; and Hawkins Motor Coach Inc., Ontario, Calif.</TEXT></DOC>
