The opposition Social Christians, one of the country'sbest-organized political groups, on Sunday nominated its leaderErick Ramirez as its candidate in the presidential election set forFebruary by the leftist Sandinista government.   But Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, director of La Prensa, has beenmentioned as a possible candidate and has said she would accept thenomination by the 12-party National Opposition Union if offered.   ``I would give up (my candidacy) and support her'' if the unionnominates her, Ramirez, a 45-year-old businessman, told TheAssociated Press by telephone.
