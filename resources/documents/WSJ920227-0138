While most countries have environmental agencies tomonitor trade in wildlife, Japan chose its chief businesspromoter, the Ministry of International Trade and Industryfor that role. &quot;Our thought was that we should coordinatebetween protecting endangered species and keeping enoughmaterial for the domestic industry,&quot; concedes TadashiSagisaka of MITI. But, &quot;we have gradually understood theimportance of protecting the environment,&quot; says Mr. Sagisaka,director of MITI's import division and one of Japan's pointmen on wildlife trade.</LP><TEXT>   Japan has recently toughened laws and slashed purchases.And to make sure the world recognizes that metamorphosis,Japan next week is to host the triennial conference of the112-nation Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies, which Japan refused to join when the group wasformed in 1975.   Environmentalists who long saw Japan as their biggestenemy now offer praise. In many ways, &quot;the situation seems tohave been ameliorated,&quot; says Hideomi Tokunaga, an activistworking on the endangered-species issue. &quot;The attitude of thegovernment officials has changed.&quot;   But there hasn't been a total shift in attitude.Government officials confess that their behavior marks less aconversion than a campaign by a country increasingly worriedabout being an international outcast. Though it's the host,Japan's main role at next week's conference in Kyoto isexpected to be backing a call by African countries to makesome ivory trade legal again, and opposing a cut inbluefin-tuna fishing. Japan still won't end its highlycontroversial whaling.   &quot;If you do something only as a result of pressure, theaction won't stay forever,&quot; says zoologist Hideo Obara, oneof the deans of Japanese environmentalism. &quot;I can'tunderstand why Japan is hosting this {conference}.&quot;   Whatever the motivation, the change comes amid a broaderenvironmental craze in Japan. Keidanren, Japan's mainbusiness organization, last year adopted an &quot;environmentalcharter,&quot; prompting many Japanese companies to create&quot;environmental departments.&quot; MITI is drawing up a &quot;New Earth21&quot; blueprint to try to vastly reduce Earth-warmingcarbon-dioxide emissions by the end of the next century, andthe agency is building a Research Institute of InnovativeTechnology for the Earth. The government has appointed an&quot;environmental ambassador&quot; and may dispatch &quot;greenpeacekeeping operations&quot; to help developing countries withenvironmental problems.   In the Group of Seven industrialized nations (the othersare the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Germany and Canada),Japan ranks near the top in atmosphere, energy, transporationand waste-disposal policies, according to a recent survey ofenvironmentalists. The Japanese say they already have thebest record on perhaps the world's most pressingenvironmental problem, the emission of carbon gases thatpromote the greenhouse effect. With high energy efficiencyand strict industrial-pollution controls, Japan releases lessthan half of such gases per capita than the U.S.   Still, many activists regard any aspirations by Japan toeco-leadership as laughable, particularly when it continuesto lead the world in such practices as whaling andrain-forest logging. The same survey of environmentalistsplaced Japan dead last among the major nations in &quot;land use&quot;and &quot;protection of species and habitat.&quot;   Despite the traditional Japanese love for nature, thecountry's postwar priority has been rapid economic growth,often at the expense of a long list of social concerns. AndJapanese society discourages grass roots political activism,which in other countries is the source of support for greenmovements; Japanese tax law discourages donating to suchgroups. The Nature Conservation Society of Japan recentlynoted in its 40th anniversary report that it has only 17,000members, compared with 5.5 million members in the U.S.   So foreign pressure is the main force for change. Suchpressure forced Japan into joining the endangered-speciesconvention in 1980, but it quickly became the group's biggestrenegade. The convention advocates a total moratorium ontrade in several hundred species it considers on the brink ofextinction. But the group's power is weak, and members areallowed to &quot;reserve&quot; species they want to continue buying. Bythe mid-1980s, Japan had 14 reservations, more than any othernation, ranging from Himalayan musk deer to desert monitorlizards. In addition, Japan didn't require permits forimports of wild plants and animals, making enforcement allbut impossible.   In 1984, a special Asian meeting of the convention inMalaysia condemned Japan's attitude, and a world-wideconference of the group in 1987 came close to doing the same.The severe foreign criticism &quot;was a great shock to theJapanese government,&quot; says Kunio Kikuchi, director of theEnvironment Agency's Wildlife Protection division.   In 1987, Japan enacted its first law regulating trade inendangered species. In 1989, it surprised environmentalistsby endorsing a world-wide ban on trading ivory tusks ofendangered African elephants. Last year, Japan agreed to stopfishing for squid with drift nets, called &quot;walls of death&quot;because they indiscriminately kill most marine life in theirpath, and to stop importing hawksbill turtle shells. But bothacts came only after the U.S. threatened economic sanctions.   Tokyo also soon hopes to enact tough legislation toprotect endangered species. In fact, Japan will soon haveeliminated all its endangered-species reservations except forsix species of whale. On this, the country remainsintransigent. It continues to kill more than 400 whales ayear as &quot;scientific research,&quot; and engages in battles withthe Greenpeace environmental group.   Japanese argue that whaling is part of their culture. Tostress the point, more than 300 government and businessleaders are expected to attend the Japan Whaling Associationbanquet in April, and feast on a variety of whale dishes. &quot;Westrongly believe the scientific evidence&quot; shows whales aren'tendangered, says Masayuki Komatsu, a deputy director of theFisheries Agency.</TEXT></DOC>
