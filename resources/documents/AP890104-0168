Under a U.N.-mediated agreement, Soviet soldiers began leavingAfghanistan on May 15, 1988, half were out by Aug. 15 and theremaining 50,000 are to be gone by Feb. 15. The guerrillas, notparties to the agreement, have continued the war.   Yuli Vorontsov, Soviet deputy foreign minister and ambassador toAfghanistan, told reporters when he arrived in Islamabad onWednesday:   ``If the cease-fire holds and there is no fighting inAfghanistan, then that's a very good situation for Soviet forces toleave.'' When asked what would happen to the withdrawal plans if theinsurgency continued, he said, ``We shall see, all of us. I don'tknow.''   Guerrillas have rejected the Soviet-backed government's offer ofa coalition and are ignoring a unilateral cease-fire it proclaimed,which began Jan. 1.   Vorontsov is expected to meet insurgent leaders Thursday inMoscow's search for a political solution to the civil war that beganafter a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiers enteredAfghanistan in December 1979 and totaled an estimated 115,000 whenthe withdrawal agreement was signed April 14 in Geneva.   The Soviet envoy held meetings in Saudi Arabia a month ago withguerrilla leaders based in Pakistan, and conferred in Tehran earlierthis week with others based in Iran.   About 5.5 million Afghans, one-third of the population, have fledsince the war began, nearly all to Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan'sneighbors on the east and west. Guerrillas use border towns andrefugee camps as bases and supply points.   Pakistan and the United States provide most of the insurgents'arms and financial support.   Guerrilla sources in Islamabad said representatives of fightersoperating from Iran were expected to arrive Thursday to join thetalks with Vorontsov.   Vorontsov said he was prepared to meet with the guerrillas, ``butthey were not ready yet before I came here.''   A guerrilla source said privately the resistance leaders fromIran and Pakistan probably would confer with each other beforemeeting Vorontsov and whether they would see him jointly orseparately had not been decided.   Vorontsov is trying to work out arrangements that will allow allSoviet forces to leave by the deadline without being attacked alongthe way. The Kremlin has acknowledged the loss of at least 13,300soldiers in the war.   He met with Foreign Minister Sahabzada Yaqub Khan soon afterarrival but would not reveal the substance. He told The AssociatedPress as he left the meeting, ``The talks were very interesting andvery useful,'' and when asked to elaborate said, ``We talked aboutoviet-Pakistan relations and Afghanistan.''   Humayun Khan of the Foreign Ministry told the AP: ``Both sidesare trying to work toward a political solution.''   Western diplomats said Tuesday that Soviet troops werewithdrawing from Shindand and Herat in western Afghanistan. Theyalso said Soviet civilian advisers were leaving Kabul en masse andquoted Afghan officials as saying the main Red Army departure fromthe capital would begin Jan. 15.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, who took over Jan. 1 as chairman of theseven-party guerrilla alliance based in Pakistan, told reportersTuesday he expected to meet Vorontsov on Friday, but guerrillasources say some alliance members want no more discussions with theSoviets.   Meeting with guerrilas is a tacit acknowledgment Moscow isexploring a non-communist alternative, but Vorontsov refused onWednesday to write off the Kremlin's allies in Kabul as participantsin a future government.   The ruling Marxists ``will survive by all means ... but they arewilling to participate in the creation of a broad-basedgovernment,'' he said. The government in Kabul is led by PresidentNajib.   Factions in the Pakistan-based guerrilla alliance are divided onmany issues, but agree Najib's regime cannot have a role in postwarAfghanistan.   They contend his government will collapse without Soviet militaryhelp, but Vorontsov called that ``a big mistake ... wishfulthinking.''   Mojaddidi announced Tuesday 400-member council would convenewithin three weeks with the task of forming a transitionalgovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
