LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain said Wednesday it will give specialresidence rights to an estimated 225,000 Hong Kong Chinese toprevent a crippling brain drain in the colony before it reverts toChina in 1997.   Right-wing legislators in the governing Conservative Partythreatened a parliamentary rebellion against what one called anappalling wave of immigration. The opposition Labor Party condemnedthe plan.   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons that amaximum of 50,000 key people in Hong Kong's public and privatesector would be given full British citizenship, along with theirfamilies. He estimated the total at 225,000 people.   Giving key people in government, business and the professionsthe right to live in Britain was essential to persuade them toremain in Hong Kong and ensure that it passes ``successfullythrough the final eight years of British rule,'' he said.   The confidence of Hong Kong's 6 million residents was ``at a lowebb'' and the ``hemorrhage of talent'' was increasing, putting thecompetitiveness of its economy at risk, Hurd said. This year,42,000 people left and 55,000 are expected to leave next year.   ``Many of those who are leaving would not do so if they couldobtain the assurance of right of abode in the United Kingdom,'' hesaid.   Britain therefore decided to offer full British citizenship to amaximum 50,000 key people from many walks of life who will beselected on a ``points system,'' Hurd said. An estimated 1,500families of Indian descent will be included.   ``The decisive criteria will be the value of the individual'sservice to Hong Kong and the extent to which people in theircategory of employment are emigrating,'' Hurd said.   He said long service with British institutions and knowledge ofEnglish would be taken into account.   About 3.25 million Hong Kong Chinese have British passports, butno residence rights.   Hurd said giving all of them the right to live in Britain wouldcreate ``unacceptable strains here'' while giving residency to justa few wouldn't solve Hong Kong's problem and might make it worse.   In Hong Kong, the government welcomed the package thoughGovernor Sir David Wilson. Several legislators said they would havepreferred full passports for all British nationals. Wilson said thepackage was not ``solely for the elite'' and would help create thestability the colony needed.   But former Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit, theringleader of an estimated 50 Tory rebels, icily told the foreignsecretary he disagreed ``with almost everything you said.''   He demanded: ``Does the pledge that we have given for the lastfour general elections that there would be no further large scaleimmigration still stand or not?''   Hurd retorted the aim was to persuade key people to stay in HongKong but even if many of them did emigrate, Britain would gainprofessional talent and expertise from one of the world's mostsuccessful societies.   ``This is the last main chapter in the story of this country'sempire. I am rather keen, and I'm sure you are rather keen, thatthe last chapter should not end in a shabby way,'' he said.   Conservative lawmaker Terry Dicks called the decision``appalling'' and a guaranteed vote-loser in the next election,which must be held by June 1992.   Fellow Conservative Tony Marlow said many people would neverforgive the government for opening the door to further immigrationin overcrowded Britain.   ``They feel a deep resentment after a generation that imposedimmigration into this country. I believe you will not beforgiven,'' he said.   Labor lawmaker Diane Abbott, the first black woman elected toParliament, accused Marlow of holding views similar to formerConservative legislator Enoch Powell who opposed black immigration.   ``Speaking in Mr Marlow's words as an `imposed immigrant' and anMP,'' she noted that ``people outside the House have listened withmounting incredulity while elements in the Tory backbenches haveout-bid each other with sub-Powellite rhetoric on this subject.''   She said Britain must withdraw from Hong Kong ``with honor, andnot in the shabby and shameful way some members are trying tocreate an issue of an imminent yellow peril.''   Labor's foreign affairs spokesman Gerald Kaufman called the plan``unreasonable, unworkable, invidious and divisive.''   Laborite Keith Vaz said the plan represented ``one law for therich and another for the poor.''</TEXT></DOC>
