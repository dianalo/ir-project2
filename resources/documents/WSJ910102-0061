Mr. Parretti had succeeded where another colorful foreigninvestor, Australian media mogul Christopher Skase, hadfailed. It was the two American entrepreneurs' misfortune tohave hitched their fate to Mr. Skase's, and now they wereauctioning off the pieces of their shipwrecked company as aresult.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We got put through a meat grinder,&quot; says Mr. Halmi.   Messrs. Lloyd and Halmi, each a principal at his own smallcompany, had simply wanted to expand their businesses. Whenthey agreed to merge, they knew a third party would gainnear-majority ownership.   But as often happens with entrepreneurs, the realizationthat they were losing control didn't really sink in. They saythey wound up as pawns in a larger game played by an outsiderthey didn't know well, and saw their businesses nearlydestroyed in the process.   Mr. Skase, whose Australian empire is now in receivership,couldn't be reached for comment. He didn't respond toquestions faxed to an intermediary in Australia.   When he met Mr. Skase in 1987, Mr. Lloyd was chieffinancial officer at Hal Roach Studios, atelevision-distribution company that owned a couple ofmiddle-market TV stations and the Hal Roach film library,which includes the Laurel andamp; Hardy comedies. Roach wanted someproduction presence, and through a partial stock swapaffiliated itself with another small publicly traded company,Robert Halmi Inc., a New York-based independent producer ofTV movies, run by Mr. Halmi and his father. The Halmis werepreparing to produce the miniseries &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; for CBS.   Roach and Halmi needed additional capital, but the marketfor public offerings in the entertainment industry was weak.Then Mr. Skase flew to Hollywood, looking like centralcasting's idea of a dashing young tycoon, according to Mr.Lloyd.   &quot;He was charismatic, energetic, and he appeared to havedone very well,&quot; Mr. Lloyd says. Mr. Skase had raised a $100million &quot;blind pool&quot; from institutional investors inAustralia to make U.S. acquisitions to add to his Australiantelevision-station-and-resort empire.   &quot;We were pitching&quot; at a meeting with the Australian, Mr.Lloyd concedes. It took Mr. Skase only a day to come up withan offer: He would supply $48 million in equity and a $50million credit line in a &quot;creeping&quot; deal that eventuallycould give him 60% of a new public company, QintexEntertainment Inc., parent of a merged Roach and Halmi. Mr.Skase never acquired more than 40%, but he was thecontrolling shareholder, and bankroller.   &quot;We knew we were selling control, that he'd be calling theshots, but we needed financing,&quot; says Mr. Lloyd. &quot;Maybe wethought he'd be a passive investor.&quot;   &quot;We looked at him as if he were a banker,&quot; echoes Mr.Halmi.   Mr. Skase turned out to be neither. He increased annualoverhead to $12 million from $2 million in three years,moving to 82 employees from 15 practically overnight, the twomen say. Mr. Skase installed a desk outfitted in LouisVuitton accessories, in a blue-marbled office that cost $1.5million to renovate and furnish with Greek statuary andHermes ashtrays emblazoned with a &quot;Q,&quot; the two men say.   Employees called it &quot;Graceland.&quot; Mr. Skase threwmillion-dollar Christmas bashes in Australia, flying guestsin first-class, Mr. Lloyd says.   Behind the glitzy front, executives began clashing overthe company's strategy for growth. U.S. executives say theywanted to move slowly by signing some talented producers ofhalf-hour comedies that could be sold to the networks.   Mr. Lloyd says Mr. Skase argued that &quot;a year is forever.&quot;A plan was hatched to buy programs already produced and bringthem to market right away. This had certain accountingadvantages, because anticipated revenue could be bookedimmediately.   The company split into Roach and Halmi factions. Mr. Halmisays Mr. Lloyd and Qintex Chairman David Evans didn't speakup early enough against Mr. Skase's plans. Mr. Lloyd felt theHalmis were more &quot;creative&quot; types than businesspeople, andthey were ousted as officers and given lucrative productiondeals, while remaining directors. In the end, both blame Mr.Skase. &quot;He created an environment where everyone was at eachother's throats,&quot; Mr. Halmi says.   When Qintex met its Waterloo, it came in the unlikely formof &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; TV series. Mr. Skase wantedto buy distribution rights to the sequel of the 1950s sitcom,which was being produced by MCA Inc., along with &quot;McHale'sNavy,&quot; the 1960s comedy that Qintex planned to colorize.   Yet MCA had its own huge distribution system, raising thequestion of why it would bother to farm out supposedly bigmoneymakers to relative unknowns. &quot;Alarm bells should havegone off&quot; about MCA's eagerness to make the deal, Mr. Lloydsays. Qintex agreed to pay about $40 million for the package.Mr. Lloyd estimates that to get a reasonable rate of return,Qintex would have had to peddle &quot;Beaver&quot; for about $350,000an episode; it got about $170,000.   Mr. Skase had, in the meantime, bought Australia's largestTV network. But when the initial Qintex payment to MCA of$5.5 million became due in January 1988, Mr. Skase threw uproadblocks, Messrs. Lloyd and Halmi say. &quot;We thought he justliked to delay until the last minute, but he was serious,&quot;Mr. Lloyd remembers. &quot;We went there and groveled&quot; until MCAagreed to a delay.   A few months later, top Qintex executives asked for ameeting with MCA's tough President Sidney Sheinberg to patchthings up, but it didn't go well. &quot;Skase showed up an hourand a half late,&quot; Mr. Lloyd says.   Then Mr. Skase, on his own, made two bids for MGM/UA,first $600 million for certain assets, then $1.5 billion forthe entire company, topping an offer from Rupert Murdoch'sNews Corp. Qintex &quot;got put into mothballs,&quot; as its chairman,Mr. Evans, went over to run MGM/UA on an interim basis, Mr.Lloyd says.   But the Skase bid for MGM/UA collapsed when he couldn'tcome up with an initial payment of $50 million. And Messrs.Lloyd and Halmi, pressured by MCA for payment and burdenedwith other debt, realized that they knew next to nothingabout Mr. Skase's assets, and that he couldn't be counted onto bail them out.   With the next MCA payment looming, an acrimoniousthree-day board meeting followed, with Mr. Skase and hisassociates arguing to reschedule the MCA debt. &quot;We thendecided to cut the cord with Australia,&quot; break with Mr. Skaseand file for creditor protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code, Mr. Lloyd says.   Mr. Lloyd, now president, fought off an attempt by anoutside investor to buy the company. And at an auction, theHalmis bought back their assets for $40 million. &quot;We got backwhat we'd built,&quot; plus the Roach library, Mr. Halmi says.   Through that sale, and the separate sale of Roach's TVstations, Mr. Lloyd has about $60 million left to pay banks,bondholders and producers, who are owed a total of about $100million.   &quot;We were just another building block to Skase,&quot; Mr. Halmisays. The lesson, he adds, is that &quot;you've got to know yourbride before you get married.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
