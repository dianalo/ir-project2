U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci approved a memorandum of understanding Friday covering the aircraft, called the FSX, which Japan will develop with General Dynamics Corp. Mr. Carlucci was here last week to brief Japan on the Moscow summit and discuss military issues.    The memorandum wraps up a three-year tussle over military-technology transfer. Mr. Carlucci's approval, a Japanese Defense Agency spokesman said, shows that the countries &quot;have effectively reached a final agreement.&quot; A senior U.S. defense official traveling with Mr. Carlucci said the agreement will formally be signed &quot;very soon.&quot;    The memorandum mirrors similar technology-transfer agreements that the U.S. has with European allies. The agreement could become a model by which Japan will acquire some of America's best military technologies, improve on them, and feed back new and refined technologies. &quot;It is a signpost for the future for both of us,&quot; said the U.S. defense official.    Japan planned to spend $6 billion to $7 billion to build as many as 130 FSX fighters for its air force. Japan's military and aerospace industry wanted to design and build the plane entirely. The U.S. Defense Department, Congress and aerospace interests wanted Japan to buy American.    The compromise is that Japan will base the design on General Dynamics' F-16 fighter but will heavily redesign the jet and build it in Japanese factories. There remain serious reservations over America's doling out some of its best technologies to Japan, which openly aspires to become a world-class aerospace power. Some U.S. aerospace executives here have suggested that Japan wants to obtain U.S. fighter technology for industrial-development goals more than for defense.    It is understood that the FSX memorandum contains two key points: guarantees that Japan will allow the U.S. to participate in development, and provisions for new technologies to flow back to the U.S.    The planes will be built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. Under the agreement, U.S. concerns will get 35% to 45% of the development and production work. Japan previously talked of conceding only 20% of the work and originally wanted more control over the technologies that flowed back to the U.S.    The memorandum provides for technology &quot;flowback&quot; in two ways. If the Japanese refine U.S. technologies already existing in the F-16, those technologies automatically will flow to the U.S. at no cost. But the U.S. must specially request and pay for original technologies that Japan develops for the plane -- a process outlined in a previous U.S.-Japan technology-transfer agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
