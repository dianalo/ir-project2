But late yesterday, GM said local union leaders wereasking members to return to their jobs in time for theevening shift. GM and the union were scheduled to begin talksto resolve the dispute, which flared after a local unionleader was suspended from his job.</LP><TEXT>   As of yesterday afternoon, GM said it had lost two shifts'worth of production Tuesday night and Wednesday morning atits Oshawa No. 1 car plant and its Oshawa truck assemblyfactory. The evening shift was canceled at the Oshawa No. 2car plant, but work resumed there yesterday morning, acompany spokesman said. Some 10,000 workers either walked offthe job or were sent home, he said.   The local union moved to halt the walkout late yesterdayafter a strong rebuke from CAW president Bob White. Mr.White, in a statement, called the shutdown &quot;absolutelyludicrous&quot; and a violation of union policy. GM had earliersaid the strike was illegal, and threatened to seekgovernment sanctions against the CAW.   The strike began about midday Tuesday when managerssuspended a CAW local official for two weeks. A GM spokesmanwouldn't elaborate on the reasons, but the union said theofficial was disciplined for remarks made to a GM manager.   Shortly after the suspension, a small group of workers ina key area of the Oshawa No. 1 car plant walked off the job,halting production of midsized Chevrolet Lumina and BuickRegal models. The CAW local then called its shop stewards offthe floor at all three Oshawa assembly facilities. Thatprecipitated a broader work stoppage that finally forced GMto cancel the evening shift Tuesday, the company said. Thework stoppages continued yesterday morning at two of thethree assembly plants at GM's Oshawa complex.   GM didn't say how many vehicles it lost because of thestrike. The two Oshawa car plants build about 400 vehicles aday, while the truck plant builds 480 vehicles a day.   Separately, GM confirmed that it will move production ofits Chevrolet Camaro and Pontiac Firebird models to its Ste.Therese, Quebec, plant. The move is expected sometime before1993, but GM didn't set a date. The company also didn'telaborate on the fate of the Van Nuys, Calif., plant thatcurrently builds the cars. But GM officials have said theyare &quot;optimistic&quot; that the Van Nuys plant will keep operatingproducing other models.   Still, Stephen P. Yokich, head of the United Auto Workersunion's GM department, denounced the move, saying suchannouncements &quot;are doing nothing to create a favorableenvironment for the difficult negotiating task we face&quot; whenthe UAW-GM contract expires this fall.</TEXT></DOC>
