Much of the improvement relates to higher productivity at deepmining operations; during the last 3.5 years, it has risen by 75%. However,British Coal is shackled by huge interest charges and restructuring costs,amounting to 215 million pounds for the half year; rises in interestrates mean that the chances of breaking even at the end of the financialyear are remote. The collapse in oil prices and fierce market competitionhas meant that British Coal has not been able to increase coal pricesto the CEGB. In addition, higher wage settlements than planned are expected.These, with the price freeze and interest payments will impose additionalcosts of 200 million pounds. Further pit closures and the loss of 8000non-industrial jobs are likely. Since the NUM strike of 1984-85, theworkforce has been reduced by 107,000 to 114,000 and the number of collieriesby 79 to 93. Productivity is now 6,500 t/week with some of the newerlongwall operations producing 50,000 t/week. Colliery operating costshave been reduced by 30%. Wage deals with the UDM are continuing; moreflexible working conditions are still to be agreed.</TEXT></DOC>
