(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An ordinance immediately banning the saleof military-style assault weapons in unincorporated areas ofAlameda County was passed Tuesday by the county Board ofSupervisors.   The 5-1 vote followed action by Gov. George Deukmejian and theLegislature restricting the sale of more than 50 kinds ofsemiautomatic assault weapons throughout California.   Supervisor Don Perata said the Alameda County ordinance closes aloophole in the state measure, which allows people to buysemiautomatic weapons until January and to apply for permits tokeep them after January.   The state law created a ``window of opportunity'' to buy theweapons, Perata said.   ``This ordinance intends to ban such sales immediately in thecounty to prevent those who would evade the law from stockpiling anarsenal while these weapons are still legally available,'' he said.   He said he was concerned about weapon stockpiling by drugdealers and others who have ``ravaged our communities.''</TEXT></DOC>
