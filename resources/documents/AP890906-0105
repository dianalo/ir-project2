Police fired tear gas to stop 5,000 workers in the port of Masanfrom marching from an export industrial complex to the streets, newsreports said.   Protesters accused the government of trying to suppress the labormovement. They demanded investigations into attacks on union officesin the industrial complex, according to Seoul's Chosun-Ilbonewspaper. Masan is 200 miles south of the capital.   In central Seoul, 1,500 gray-robed Buddhist monks gathered withtheir supporters at Chogyesa Temple shouting, ``Down with thegovernment which suppresses Buddhism!'   The monks issued a statement vowing ``to terminate theauthoritarian rule of Roh's government.''   They were protesting the arrest of Lee Ji-kwan, president ofSeoul's Buddhist-run Dongguk University, for allegedly sellingcollege places. Lee was freed, but Buddhists claim the governmenttrumped up the charge.   Students rallied in three cities today to demand the release of aradical student jailed for traveling illegally to North Korea.   ``Overthrow the Roh regime which suppresses the masses!'' anorganizer told the Seoul rally, which included students from morethan 30 schools.   ``Realize unification through struggles against the UnitedStates,'' said a student statement supporting unification withcommunist North Korea. Radicals, a small but vocal minority, feelthe presence of 43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea hindersunification.   In Pusan, 1,600 students from three colleges battled riot policewith firebombs and rocks to demand the ouster of the government andthe release of Im Su-kyong, a 20-year-old student who traveledillegally to North Korea to attend a youth festival in July, theofficial Yonhap news agency reported. Peaceful rallies were held atthree other Pusan schools, it said.   In Suwon, just south of Seoul, 700 students from eight schoolsclashed with riot police in an anti-government protest on a streetin front of Sunkyunkwan University, and eight students werearrested, Yonhap said.   The most violent scenes took place in the capital, where morethan 1,000 combat-clad riot police and four armored vehicles firingtear gas stormed onto Seoul National University campus to break up arally of 3,000 students.   ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!'' students screamed before they fled,coughing and choking in tear gas so thick campus buildings could notbe seen. They regrouped, pelting police with hundreds of large rocksand lunging at them with metal pipes. But the black-helmeted policeheld the campus gates.   Witnesses said two dozen cars in a campus parking lot weresmashed by rocks thrown by both sides. There were numerous injuries,but no arrests were made.</TEXT></DOC>
