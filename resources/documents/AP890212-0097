Leonard Thomas of Colonial Savings of Western Kansas, anexecutive who attended, told the Post he thought the session was a``secret meeting.'' Colonial, based in Liberal, Kan., was the onlyout-of-state thrift represented.   ``There was a general concern that if the regulators found outthat all the Sandamp;L guys got together they might misconstrue thesituation,'' Thomas said. ``In 1985, there were a lot of scaredpeople running around.''   The June 11, 1985, meeting was called by Continental SavingsPresident David Wylie and Chairman Carroll Kelly in a May 22, 1985,letter written on Continental Savings stationery. A copy of theletter was obtained by the Post.   Continental Savings, based in the Houston suburb of Bellaire,later failed.   ``We discovered the letter over a year ago,'' said RosemaryStewart, director of enforcement for the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, which regulates savings and loans. ``We turned it over to theDepartment of Justice as part of an ongoing criminal investigation.''   Sources who attended the meeting told the Post that severalissues were discussed, including how to evade loan limits to oneborrower and how to remove delinquent loans and foreclosed realestate from thrift books by selling them to other thrifts.   Industry sources familiar with the meeting said the effect ofthose actions would have been to move bad loans around to hide themfrom regulators and make the thrifts appear to be in betterfinancial shape than they were.   Ms. Stewart said such actions could be illegal, depending on theparticular circumstances.   ``Selling REO (real estate owned) can be perfectly lawful undercertain circumstances, but if they were selling REO (to fool theregulators), that would be a violation of Federal Home Loan BankBoard rules and very likely a criminal violation _ willfulmisstatement of the books and records,'' she said.   ``I remember them talking about selling REOs,'' said B.G. Wylie,former chairman of American Savings and Loan in Lake Jackson and thefather of David Wylie.   ``If something was done, it was after I left. I don't knowwhether any of them got together on the REOs,'' Wylie said.   Another source who attended said the sale of REOs was discussed,along with evasion of loan limits and growth limits. Wylie said hedidn't remember anyone at the meeting discussing loan limits to oneborrower.</TEXT></DOC>
