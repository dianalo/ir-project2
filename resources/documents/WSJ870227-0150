BrowningStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP BAAEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The French government signed a $550 million contract to buy three early-warning radar aircraft from Boeing Co., in another step toward greater defense cooperation with France's Western allies.    With the added costs of training, extra equipment and installations, French Defense Minister Andre Giraud said, the purchase will cost France the equivalent of $947 million. Delivery of the planes is scheduled to begin in late 1990. The contract with Boeing, a U.S. aerospace concern, also includes an option to buy two more Awacs planes within the next eight months.    In an effort to reduce costs, France negotiated the Awacs purchases together with Britain, which recently agreed to buy six of the craft.    Under a policy of independence begun nearly three decades ago during the presidency of the late Charles de Gaulle, France is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but doesn't participate in its military command. While France is still committed to such independence, the Awacs purchase is the latest in a series of quiet moves toward working more closely with other NATO countries.    &quot;There is still great resistance within the armed forces to a reintegration in NATO,&quot; said Jerome Paolini, a research associate at the French Institute for International Relations. &quot;But traditionally, France has tended to seek a strictly national, autonomous solution. Now there is more willingness to cooperate.&quot;    The Awacs contract comes after an agreement last year under which France bought a British radar system and Britain bought a French system of unmanned mine-detecting submarines. Mr. Giraud said France will discuss further cooperation when British Defense Secretary George Younger visits France early next month.    &quot;We hope our cooperation will develop in other defense areas,&quot; said Mr. Giraud. He added that &quot;the French Awacs will be able to work either independently, or inter-operably with the European and U.S. Awacs systems.&quot;    The French Awacs purchase will make it easier for France both to move closer to NATO and to assert its independence. France currently has no over-the-horizon radar, and thus little ability to track low-flying aircraft and cruise missiles.    But France's Awacs will also be capable of working closely with the U.S. Awacs fleet, as well as the NATO fleet based in West Germany, the British system and even that of Saudi Arabia. If France had developed its own system, as it once considered, such cooperation would have been difficult.    France, like Britain, is to benefit from a counterpurchase agreement under which Boeing over the next eight years is to buy French-made parts and equipment valued at 130% of the Awacs purchase price. </TEXT></DOC>
