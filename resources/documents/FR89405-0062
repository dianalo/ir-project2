OnNovember 28, 1980 (45 FR 79318), EPA announced the publication of 64 individualambient water quality criteria documents for pollutants listed as toxicunder Section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act. A criteria document for2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) was published on February 15,1984 (49 FR 5831), completing the coverage of the 65 toxic pollutants listedunder Section 307(a)(1).EPA issued nine individual water quality criteria documents on July 29,1985 (50 FR 30784) which updated or revised criteria previously publishedin the ``Red Book'' or in the 1980 water quality criteria documents. Arevised version of the National Guidelines for Deriving Numerical NationalWater Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and TheirUses was announced at the same time. A bacteriological ambient water qualitycriteria document was published on March 7, 1986 (51 FR 8012). A waterquality criteria document for dissolved oxygen was published on June 24,1986 (51 FR 22978). All of the publications cited above were summarizedin ``Quality Criteria for Water, 1986'' which was released by the Officeof Water Regulations and Standards on December 3, 1986 (51 FR 43665). Finalwater quality criteria documents for chlorpyrifos, nickel, pentachlorophenol,parathion, and toxaphene were issued by EPA on December 3, 1986 (51 FR43665). On March 2, 1987, (52 FR 6213), EPA announced the publication ofrevised ambient water quality criteria for selenium which updated criteriapreviously published in 1980. A final criteria document for chloride waspublished on May 26, 1988 (53 FR 19028) and for aluminum on August 30,1988 (53 FR 33177); no previous criteria were issued for these substances.Today EPA is announcing the availability of an ambient water quality criteriadocument for ammonia for the protection of saltwater aquatic organisms.A draft criteria document for saltwater ammonia was made available forpublic comment on October 8, 1987 (52 FR 37597). These final criteria werederived after consideration of all comments received, and following analysisof additional data received after the draft document was published.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Rebecca W. Hanmer,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Administrator for Water.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix A_Summary of Water Quality Criteria for Ammonia (Saltwater)</ITAG>The procedures described in the ``Guidelines for Deriving Numerical NationalWater Quality Criteria for the Protection of Aquatic Organisms and TheirUses'' indicate that, except possibly where a locally important speciesis very sensitive, saltwater aquatic organisms should not be affected unacceptablyif the four-day average concentration of un-ionized ammonia does not exceed0.035 mg/L more than once every three years on the average and if the one-houraverage concentration does not exceed 0.233 mg/L more than once every threeyears on the average. Because sensitive saltwater animals appear to havea narrow range of acute susceptibilities to ammonia, this criterion willprobably be as protective as intended only when the magnitudes and/or durationsof excursions are appropriately small.Criteria concentrations based on total ammonia for the pH range of 7.0to 9.0, temperature range of 0 to 35 anddegrees;C, and salinities of 10,20 and 30 g/kg are provided in Tables 1 and 2 below. These values werecalculated by Hampson's (1977) program of Whitfield's (1974) model forhydrolysis of ammonium ions in sea water.Three years is the Agency's best scientific judgment of the average amountof time aquatic ecosystems should be provided between excursions. The abilityof ecosystems to recover differ greatly.Site-specific criteria may be established if adequate justification isprovided. This site-specific criterion may include not only site-specificcriteria concentrations, and mixing zone considerations (U.S. EPA, 1983b),but also site-specific durations of averaging periods and site-specificfrequencies of allowed exceedences (U.S. EPA 1985b).Use of criteria for developing water quality-based permit limits and fordesigning waste treatment facilities requires the selection of an appropriatewasteload allocation model. Dynamic models are preferred for the applicationof these criteria (U.S. EPA 1985b). Limited data or other considerationsmight make their use impractical, in which case one should rely on a steady-tatemodel (U.S. EPA 1986).ImplementationWater quality standards for ammonia developed from these criteria shouldspecify use of environmental monitoring methods which are comparable tothe analytical methods employed to generate the toxicity data base. Totalammonia may be measured using an automated idophenol blue method, suchas described by Technicon Industrial Systems (1973) or U.S. EPA (1979)method 350.1. Un-ionized ammonia concentrations should be calculated usingthe dissociation model of Whitfield (1974) as programmed by Hampson (1977).This program was used to calculate most of the un-ionized values for saltwaterorganisms used in this document. Accurate measurement of sample pH is crucialin the calculation of the un-ionized ammonia fraction. The following equipmentand procedures were used by EPA in the ammonia toxicity studies to enhancethe precision of pH measurements in salt water. The pH meter reported twodecimal places. A Ross electrode with ceramic junction was used due toits rapid response time; an automatic temperature compensation probe providedtemperature correction. Note that the responsiveness of a new electrodemay be enhanced by holding it in sea water for several days prior to use.Two National Bureau of Standards buffer solutions for calibration preferredfor their stability were (1) potassium hydrogen phthalate (pH 4.00) and(2) disodium hydrogen phosphate (pH 7.4). For overnight or weekend storage,the electrode was held in salt water, leaving the fill hole open. For dailyuse, the outer half-cell was filled with electrolyte to the fill hole andthe electrode checked for stability. The electrode pair was calibratedonce daily prior to measuring pH of samples; it was never recelibrted duringa series of measurements. Following calibration, the electrode was soakedin sea water, of salinity similar to the sample, for at least 15 minutesto achieve chemical equilibrium and a steady state junction potential.When measuring pH, the sample was initially gently agitated or stirredto assure good mixing at the electrode tip, but without entraining airbubbles in the sample. Stirring was stopped to read the meter. The electrodewas allowed to equilibrate so the change in meter reading was less than0.02 pH unit/minute before recording. Following each measurement, the electrodewas rinsed with sea water and placed in fresh sea water for the temporarystorage between measurements. Additional suggestions to improve precisionof saltwater pH measurements may be found in Zirno (1975), Grasshoff (1983),and Butler et al. (1985).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Water Quality Criteria for Saltwater Aquatic Life Based onTotal Ammonia (mg/L) Criteria Maximum Concentrations</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Temperature

Documentfor Ammonia (Saltwater)</ITAG>After review of all the comments received during the public comment periodfollowing the announcement of their availability in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the agency has prepared the following response.A total of 3 respondents submitted comments, and except for a few redundantpoints, each comment has been answered individually. The references whichare cited appear at the end of this document.<T3>Comment: </T3>The chronic value from the mysid life-cycle test shouldbe raised from 0.1224 mg/L to 0.2323 mg/L because decreased length of femaleswithout a decrease in weight is not biologically significant.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees that a five percent decrease in length offemales, particularly in the absence of a decrease in lengths of malesand in weights of mysids of both sexes, is probably not biologically meaningful.Reproduction of mysids is related to size. Because a statistically significantdecrease in size is more readily detected than a decrease in reproduction,a decrease in length may be biologically important. In this experiment,no decrease in reproduction is evident.<T3>Comment: </T3>The chronic value from the silverside early life-stagetest should be raised from 0.061 mg/L to 0.289 mg/L because wet, and notdry, weights of fish were used to set the chronic values.<T3>Response: </T3>Early life-stage tests based on suvival and growth areconsidered surrogates in the National Guidelines for entire life-cycletests based on survival, growth and reproduction. Therefore, early life-stagetests with fishes must include measurements of growth if results are interpretedas concentrations protecting a fish throughout its life-cycle.EPA agrees with ASTM that dry weights are generally preferred over wetweights. Either procedure is acceptable by ASTM and both are required iffish are edematous. The important issue is not how size is measured, rather,it is whether size differences are a result of exposure to ammonia. Theevidence available indicates that reductions in growth of siversides arereal. Reductions in weights were concentration dependent; siversides exposedto 0.074 mg/L unionized ammonia weighed 84.6% of the weights of controlfish and fish exposed to 0.38 mg/L weighed 68.5% of controls. Fish in intermediateconcentrations of ammonia were similarly affected. Probably even more importantly,ammonia's chronic effect on growth is well-documented in early life-stageor life-cycle tests with mysids, stoneflys, pink salmon, rainbow trout,Atlantic salmon, fathead minnows, green sunfish, bluegill, smallmouth bass,and channel catfish.<T3>Comment: </T3>Chronic values from the silverside early life-stage (ELS)test are inappropriate for use because only acute-chronic ratios from studieswhere pH andCx.170;7.7 should be used as was the case in the freshwater criteriadocument.<T3>Response: </T3>The ELS test with <T3>Menidia beryllina </T3>is one of only two chronic tests with saltwaterspecies and, as such, should only be deleted for very good cause. Chronicdata from the smallmouth bass ELS tests, which represents the best chronicfreshwater data base, indicates that acute-chronic ratios at pH valuesof 7.2 and 6.6 are greater than those at pH values of 7.8 and 8.7. Thissuggests that somewhere between a pH of 7.2 and 7.8 the ratio is pH dependent.Although the fresh water document mentions the value of andCx.170;7.7, therange of pH values was considerably lower in tests actually used to calculatethe final acute chronic ratios in the freshwater document. For example,pH ranged from 7.3 to 7.6 for tests with rainbow trout and from 7.34 to7.95, 7.53 to 8.37 and 7.6 to 7.8 in three tests with channel catfish.In the <T3>Menidia </T3>ELS test, the pH values from critical concentrations;i.e., upper and lower chronic values, averaged 7.60 and 7.73. Therefore,data from the <T3>Menidia </T3>test is not unique relative to fresh water data and thetest should not be rejected based on pH. Finally, the role of pH in theacute toxicity of ammonia to saltwater species appears less than that forfreshwater species. This may also be true for the pH-chronic toxicity relationship.<T3>Comment: </T3>The acute-chronic ratio of 15 for catfish should notbe used because it is based on an acute value from a 24-hour test.<T3>Response: </T3>The presumed 96-hour LC50 (1.57 mg/L, extrapolated fromthe 24-hr LC50 of 2.42 mg/L) is in the lower range of LC50s for channelcatfish and to suggest that the 96-hour LC50 is much lower is unreasonablebased on existing information. The acute:chronic ratio is high not becausethe LC50 is too high, but because the chronic value is the lowest observedone. To ignore the fact that this chronic value indicates a higher acute-chronicratio would be irresponsible. Also, the lowest acute:chronic ratio forchannel catfish. (7.5) is based on a juvenile test, which can be arguedeven more to be of secondary importance. Also, an additional chronic testwhich had effects at the lowest tested concentration indicated that theacute:chronic ratio is probably 12 or greater, but this was not used becauseit was indeterminate. The average ratio used for catfish (10) is therefore,reasonable.<T3>Comment: </T3>The chronic value for the white sucker appears to beoverestimated. The decrease growth was neither biologically nor statisticallysignificant.<T3>Response: </T3>The author of this study is trying to locate the originaldata so that a complete analysis can be done. Interim analysis by EPA usingdata from the report has suggested that this chronic value is not likelyvalid. An analysis of variance using mean lengths within tanks indicatedno statistically significant effect. Furthermore, independent of any statisticalsignificance, there is little support for the opinion that the 5% reductionin length at 0.063 mg/L is actually an effect of ammonia, because (a) thiseffect is small, (b) there was little or no further effect at 0.101 and0.187 mg/L, and (c) there was no reduction in weight at any of these concentrations(in fact, weights were greatest at 0.063 mg/L). The percent swim-up at72 hours was also affected at 0.063 mg/L, but this was based on pairwisetests rather than multiple comparison tests and was not considered in ourdocument as establishing an appropriate chronic value. Until data fromthis experiment becomes available, the acute-chronic ratio for the whitesucker will not be used. <T3>Comment: </T3>Scientific justification is not provided for the useof only those acute:chronic ratios for freshwater fishes for which thechronic value was less than the median and for which the chronic test wasrun at pH 7.7 or above. <T3>Response: </T3>Justification of this approach is provided in the ammoniawater criteria document for fresh water (U.S. EPA, 1985). Available chronicdata for freshwater species suggest a greater effect of pH on chronic toxicitythan acute toxicity, leading to greater acute:chronic ratios at low pH.Chronic tests at pH 7.5 and below reflect this phenomenon; to use ratiosfrom these tests would produce too high a ratio for the higher pHs. A pHandgreater; 7.7 was selected for the average simply because in this range,no pH effects on ratios were evident. Criteria at lower pH are adjustedupward from this average, consistent with available data. Since total ammoniais not more restrictive at low pH, EPA does not believe this protocol representsany real hardship. By definition, the acute:chronic ratio should be appropriate for takingthe fifth percentile acute value and computing the fifth percentile chronicvalue. Thus, ratios for organisms at high percentile values are irrelevantto computing an appropriate ratio. Since there were nine acute:chronicratios in the accepted pH range, there was sufficient information on theapparent percentile range for the chronic values that it was not appropriateto use all ratios. By using the median as a breaking point, there werestill five ratios (more than the minimum needed) and it can be best arguedthat the organisms with chronic tolerance above the median are most irrelevantto regulating the criterion. Also, there was a good separation of sensitivitiesand ratios_the warm water fish with average chronic values andless;0.2 mg/Lhad ratios of 10 and above, while the invertebrates and fish with chronicvalues andgreater;0.3 mg/L had ratios of 6 and below. (ERL, Duluth response)<T3>Comment: </T3>The majority of the data used to derive the ammonia criteriaare results of bioassays which would probably not meet the EPA draft specificationsfor the exposure conditions during short-term tests, and hence are notsound scientific studies. Of concern is the reported variance in pH inthe ammonia test exposures. The mysid and sheepshead minnow data sets specificallyshould not be used since a majority of these tests did not meet the exposureconditions required by pH, temperature, and salinity specified in EPA draftshort-term methods. <T3>Response: </T3>The draft short-term methods referred to above are EPA'stests for rapidly evaluating the toxicity of effluents and receiving waters(Weber et al. 1988). These short-term tests have rather restrictive exposureconditions due to their particular application and are not acceptable forcalculation of criteria concentrations. The appropriate tests for derivationof the Final Acute and Chronic Values in Water Quality Criteria documentsare acute toxicity tests (96H in most cases) and early life stage or life-cycletoxicity tests. The ammonia criteria for salt water are based on theselatter types of tests which were conducted in a manner consistent withASTM standard practices and include tests at different pH, temperatureor salinity conditions to determine the effect of each on the toxicityof un-ionized ammonia. <T3>Comment: </T3>The conclusion that pH does not have a consistent influenceon ammonia acute toxicity would not be supported if the saltwater datawere interpreted in a manner consistent with the freshwater data. Therefore,it appears premature to dismiss pH dependency. <T3>Response: </T3>The ammonia water quality criteria for fresh water requireddata sets of at least six LC50 observations spread over at least four distinctpHs, with a range of at least 1.5 pH units, for critical evaluation ofpH dependency model fit. The empirical model for pH dependency was developedusing data sets for the three freshwater fishes and one fresh water invertebratewhich met these requirements. No saltwater data sets meet these requirementsif we limit our consideration to flow-through test results only. The flow-throughrestriction was adopted in light of the difficulty of controlling pH instatic ammonia toxicity tests in salt water, particularly at pHs beyondthe naturally buffered range of 7.8 to 8.2. The freshwater ammonia criteria states that its empirical model for pHdependency cannot be considered universally applicable. EPA has concludedthat there are insufficient saltwater data to support use of this modelwith ammonia criteria for saltwater biota. The saltwater flow-through datasets for individual species are too small to be tested statistically againstthe non-linear freshwater model. Pooling these data failed to produce amodel fit after 50 iterations using LC50s representing the pH range of7 to 9, nor for the 7 to 8 pH range alone. EPA excluded from these pooleddata sets <T3>Menidia beryllina </T3>values at low salinity and also the LC50 forpH 9 at 31 g/kg, since these results clearly do not fit the model. Themechanism of acute toxicity of ammonia in aquatic organisms is unknown,but it is possible that a freshwater model for ammonia toxicity may notbe applicable to saltwater biota. Freshwater and saltwater organisms areadapted to markedly different osmotic and ionic environments and theirphysiological responses to elevated concentrations of ammonia may differas well.A comparison of the general relationship between pH and acute ammonia toxicityin freshwater and saltwater animals shows certain similarities, but alsosome distinct differences. The primary similarity exists in the increasein NH<T2>3</T2> toxicity at pHs below 8, which is evident in mysids, prawn (notflow-through) and inland silverside when tested in full strength sea water.Above pH 8, mysids differ from most freshwater species, with acute toxicitycontinuing to decrease by a factor of 1.7 to 2 with a one pH unit increase.On the other hand, inland silverside tested in full strength sea waterdiffer from freshwater species with greater than a factor of 2 decreasein toxicity at pH 9 relative to pH 8. A marked departure from this freshwaterpattern also is evident with inland silversides tested at 11 g/kg, a typicalsalinity for this species, with a lower toxicity at pH 7 than at pH 8.In contrast to either of these species, static tests with Atlantic silversidesuggest little influence of pH on toxicity. In light of these differentresponses as well as the limited information available on pH influence,particularly for saltwater fishes, EPA concluded it is premature to adoptan ammonia criteria for salt water which is pH dependent. EPA encouragesthe development of data bases on water quality-toxicity relationships forsaltwater species for pH, temperature and other factors. Design of thisresearch should take into account acclimation history of tested species.<T3>Comment:</T3> EPA has not dealt properly with the issue of pH determinationin salt water in its analysis of the ammonia toxicity literature. Ratherthan accepting the un-ionized ammonia concentrations as reported, it isrecommended that the Agency determine whether low ionic strength standardbuffers were used in measuring pH by each author. These pH values shouldbe modified using the Davies approximation of the Debye-Huckel LimitingLaw and the revised values used to adjust reported un-ionized ammonia toxicityvalues.<T3>Response:</T3> None of the ammonia toxicity literature reviewed stateduse of TRIS seawater buffer standards, which are alternatives to low ionicstrength National Bureau of Standards (NBS) buffers for calibration. Itis reasonable to assume that only NBS standards have been employed, sincethese are the only standards which are commercially available to investigators.Millero (1986) has shown pH(NBS) produces a small overestimation of pHmeasured on the free hydrogen ion scale (pH(F)), which is the scale usedby Khoo et al. 1977 in their experimental determination of the thermodynamicsammonium ion dissociation in sea water. This difference is on the orderof 0.02 pH unit at 30 g/kg salinity and increases with a decrease in salinityto 0.075 pH unit at 10 g/kg salinity. Reported pH values also reflect variance(andplusmin; 0.03 pH unit) due to residual liquid junction potential (Whitfieldet al. 1985). Variability in reported pH values from these two sourceswas recognized by EPA and is considered to be small, well within the factorof 2 variance which may occur between laboratories conducting toxicitytests. Use of the Davies approximation to revise pH values and adjust NH<T2>3</T2> toxicity values would not be appropriate, as it is not applicablein natural water systems having electrolyte mixtures of unlike change types(Stumm and Morgan 1981, p. 134).<T3>Comment:</T3> The use of Hampson's (1977) computer program to calculatecriteria values for total ammonia is improper because this program is onlyvalid when using pH calibrated with a synthetic seawater buffer, not thepH(NBS) which is the scale approved by EPA for measuring pH.<T3>Response:</T3> The experimental verification by Khoo et al. (1977)of Whitfield's (1974) calculations of the hydrolysis of ammonium ions insea water shows that pH determination using the free hydrogen ion scale(pH(F)) produces values in close agreement with Whitfield's models. Useof the pH(f) scale in ammonia toxicity testing would be desirable froma thermodynamic standpoint. This is not practical, however, as seawaterbuffers are not commercially available and they are moderately difficultto prepare (Culberson, personal communication). Calibration of pH withNBS buffers does result in an overestimation of pH, relative to pH(F),but fortuitously the error is small (0.02 pH unit at 30 g/kg salinity and0.075 at 10 g/kg), presumably due to a compensation of residue liquid junctionpotential by changes in activity coefficients (Millero 1986). The use ofpH(NBS) in ammonia toxicity testing or in environmental monitoring doesnot invalidate use of Whitfield's models or Hampson's (1977) program tocalculate the un-ionized ammonia fraction.Consistent use of pH(NBS) in ammonia toxicity studies which support saltwaterammonia criteria and in water quality monitoring for ammonia will reducethe problems associated with use of low ionic strength standards when measuringpH in salt water. Residue liquid junction potential errors up to andplusmin;0.03 pH unit may still occur when using pH(NBS) in salt water (Whitfieldet al. 1985) and will result in some error in NH<T2>3</T2> calculations. In light of the importance of pH in this calculation,it is crucial to take steps to increase precision in pH measurements madefor these purposes, which is the intent of the implementation section ofthe saltwater ammonia criteria document.The EPA Environmental Monitoring and Support Laboratory, Cincinnati, Ohio,has been requested to investigate issues associated with accurate and precisemeasurement of pH in salt water. This will include evaluating the desirabilityof a new methods standardization for estuarine and ocean water pH.<T3>Comment:</T3> The saltwater ammonia document differs from the freshwater document in the treatment of the temperature dependence of the dissociationconstant for ammonia.<T3>Response:</T3> The relationship between the dissociation constant (pK<T2>a</T2>) and temperature used in the saltwater document, is of the form.<ITAG tagnum="26">pK*<T2>a</T2> = A + B + BT</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">as employed by Whitfield (1974, Eq. 19). In that paper, Whitfieldconcluded that this relationship was reasonable based on good agreementof the experimental and calculated values of pKa's available at that time(Table 9, Whitfield). Examining experimental measurements of Khoo et al.(1977), Whitfield (1978) subsequently noted that a more accurate representationof temperature variation of pK<T2>a</T2>'s is the form<ITAG tagnum="26">pK*<T2>a</T2> = A/T + B + CT</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">particularly at 35anddegrees;C or at 44.55 g/kg salinity (Table 6).However, across the temperature range of 5 to 25anddegrees;C at 20.31 and35 g/kg salinity, Whitfield's former relationship also corresponded wellwith the experimental measurements of Khoo et al. (1977).<ITAG tagnum="73">Reference Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Hampson, B.L. 1977. Relationship between total ammonia and free ammoniain terrestrial and ocean waters. J. Const. int. Explor.
