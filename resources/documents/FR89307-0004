Effective October 13, 1981,an official staff commentary (TIL-1, Supp. I to 12 CFR Part 226) was publishedto interpret the regulation. The commentary is designed to provide guidanceto creditors in applying the regulation to specific transactions and isupdated periodically to address significant questions that arise. Therehave been seven general updates and one limited update so far. This noticecontains the eighth general update. This update reflects material thatwas published in two proposed updates in 1988_a special update regardingdisclosures for adjustable-rate mortgages published at 53 FR 38018 (September29, 1988) and the proposed general update published at 53 FR 48925 (December5, 1988). Creditors are free to rely on the revised commentary as of February28, 1989, although they need not follow the revisions until October 1,1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">(2) Revisions. </ITAG>The following is a brief description of the revisions to the commentary:<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart A_General </ITAG>Section 226.2_Definitions and Rules of Construction <ITAG tagnum="81">2(a) Definitions </ITAG><T3>2(a)(25) ``Security Interest''. </T3>In the original proposal, comment23(b)-3 would have been revised to clarify that multiple security interestsin the same property need not be disclosed on rescission notices. The comment,for example, would have clarified that the disclosure that an interestis retained, as in form H-9, is adequate in a refinancing where a new mortgageis filed and a new advance is made. Several commenters suggested that thecommentary also provide guidance on the specificity required of the securityinterest disclosure under andSection;andSection;226.6, 226.15, and 226.18.In order to clarify that the same principle holds true in other requireddisclosures of security interests, the substance of the proposed commenthas been incorporated in new comment 2(a)(25)-6, instead of in comment23(b)-3. Section 226.4_Finance Charge <ITAG tagnum="81">4(a) Definition </ITAG>Comment 4(a)-3 is revised to clarify that charges imposed on the consumerby someone other than the creditor are finance charges if the creditorrequires the services of the third party. For example, if a consumer cannotobtain the same credit terms from the creditor without using a loan broker,a fee imposed by the broker is a finance charge. The revised comment doesnot affect existing rules regarding charges which are excluded from thefinance charge. <ITAG tagnum="81">4(b) Examples of Finance Charges </ITAG><T3>Paragraphs 4(b) (7) and (8)</T3>. Comment 4(b) (7) and (8)-2 is revisedto clarify that insurance ``written in connection with a credit transaction''does not include insurance written during an open-end credit plan if theinsurance is written because of the consumer's default or because the consumerrequests voluntary insurance after the opening of the plan. If insurancewritten during the term of the open-end plan is required by the creditornot as a result of the consumer's default, however, the insurance is writtenin connection with the plan. The final comment, which differs from theproposed comment, will provide identical rules for insurance written afterconsummation of a closed-end transaction and insurance written during thelife of an open-end plan. <ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart C_Closed-End Credit</ITAG>Section 226.17_General Disclosure Requirements<ITAG tagnum="81">17(a) Form of Disclosures</ITAG><T3>Paragraph 17(a)(1)</T3>. Comment 17(a)(1)-5 is revised to provide thatcreditors with variable-rate transactions subject to andSection; 226.18(f)(2)may also provide the information set forth in andSection; 226.18(f)(1) asinformation directly related to the required disclosures. <ITAG tagnum="81">17(c) Basis of Disclosures and Use of Estimates</ITAG><T3>Paragraph 17(c)(1). </T3>Comment 17(c)(1)-8 is revised to clarify thebasis of disclosure for variable-rate transactions with no initial discountedor premium rate. The comment explains that creditors should base theirdisclosures only on the initial rate and not on any potential rate increases.The comment also has been been reorganized for clarity, but is not differentin substance from the proposal.Comments 17(c)(1)-14 and 17(c)(1)-15 are renumbered as 17(c)(1)-15 and17(c)(1)-16, respectively. New comment 17(c)(1)-14 is added to clarifyhow lenders should provide disclosures for reverse mortgages. These mortgages,also known as reverse annuity or home equity conversion mortgages, typicallyinvolve the disbursement of monthly or other periodic advances to the consumerfor a fixed period or until the occurrence of an event such as the saleof the house by the consumer or the consumer's death. Repayment of theloan may be required at the end of the disbursement period or at a latertime; both accrued interest and principal generally are payable in onepayment.Some reverse ``term'' mortgages have a fixed term for the disbursementof funds to the consumer, but provide that the loan does not have to berepaid until a later time, such as when the consumer dies. The commentprovides that the creditor should assume repayment will occur at the timedisbursements are scheduled to end (or during a period following the dateof the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular intervalbetween disbursements). For example, in a transaction with monthly disbursementsscheduled for ten years, the creditor may assume that repayment will bemade in the 120th or 121st month.The new comment also provides guidance on how creditors should make disclosureswhen both the period for disbursements and the date for repayment are determinedsolely by reference to future events, including the consumer's death. Insuch cases, the creditor may assume that disbursements will end upon theconsumer's death (by using actuarial tables, for example). Alternatively,the creditor may assume that disbursements end upon the occurrence of theevent that the creditor estimates will be most likely to occur first. Ifterms will be determined by reference to future events which do not includethe consumer's death, the creditor must base the disclosures on the eventestimated to be most likely to occur first. The creditor must assume repaymentwill occur at the same time the disbursements end (or during a period followingthe final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval betweendisbursements).The comment also provides that, in making disclosures, creditors wouldassume that all disbursements and accrued interest must be paid by theconsumer. Thus, if a reverse mortgage has a ``nonrecourse'' provision providingthat the consumer is not obligated for an amount greater than the valueof the house, the comment explains that the disclosures must assume thatthe full amount disbursed will be repaid, although the creditor is permittedto explain that the consumer's contract may limit the amount that mustbe repaid.Finally, the comment addresses the disclosure of shared-appreciation featuresassociated with reverse mortgages. The commentary provides that the appreciationfeature should be disclosed in accordance with either andSection; 226.18(f)(1)or andSection; 226.19(b), as appropriate.Section 226.18_Content of Disclosures<ITAG tagnum="81">18(f) Variable Rate</ITAG><T3>Paragraph 18(f)(2). </T3>Comment 18(f)(2)-1 is revised by adding across-reference to the commentary to andSection; 226.17(a)(1) regarding thedisclosure of additional variable-rate information as directly relatedinformation.Section 226.19_Certain Residential Mortgage Transactions<ITAG tagnum="81">19(b) Certain Variable-Rate Transactions</ITAG>Comment 19(b)-1 is revised to clarify the disclosure of variable-rate constructionloans that may be permanently financed. Under the current rules in andSection;226.17(c)(6), a creditor may disclose the construction and permanent financingarrangements, under andSection; 226.18, as a single combined transactionor as separate transactions. Under revised comment 19(b)-1, a creditoris permitted to apply a similar analysis in determining the applicabilityof the variable-rate disclosure requirements of andSection; 226.19(b). Thus,the creditor may treat the construction phase as a separate transactionand, if the term is one year or less, disclosures under andSection; 226.19(b)are not required for the construction phase. The comment also makes clearthat a creditor may treat the construction and permanent phases as separateand distinct transactions for purposes of determining coverage under andSection;226.19(b), yet still provide a single andSection; 226.18 disclosure in accordancewith the rules in andSection; 226.17(c)(6). If the construction and permanentphases are treated as a single combined transaction with a term greaterthan one year, disclosures under andSection; 226.18(f)(2) would be required.As provided in comment 17(a)(1)-5, however, the creditor may describe thevariable-rate features of the combined transaction pursuant to andSection;226.18(f)(1).Comment 19(b)-1 also is revised to address the disclosure requirementsin assumptions of variable-rate transactions secured by the consumer'sprincipal dwelling with a term longer than one year. The comment explainsthat disclosures need not be provided under andSection; 226.18(f)(2)(ii)or 226.19(b). References to applicable sections and to particular partiesare deleted as unnecessary and in order to make the comment more concise.<T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2). </T3>Comment 19(b)(b)-1 is revised to omit referencesto the form of disclosures for ARM programs. New comment 19(b)(2)-3 hasbeen added to describe the manner in which creditors may make the disclosuresfor each ARM program they offer.Comment 19(b)(2)-1 also is revised to clarify the timing requirements fordisclosures provided in response to a subsequent expression of interestby the consumer. Editorial changes have been made to the original proposal.The final comment makes clear that if a consumer expresses an interestin a different program, or it the consumer and creditor decide on a programdifferent than that set forth in the disclosures that were first provided,disclosures for the new program must be provided as soon as reasonablypossible. In addressing the proposed revision to comment 19(b)(2)-1, several commentersalso requested clarification of the timing requirements in situations,such as private banking arrangements, where loan terms that are not generallyoffered to the public are individually negotiated with a consumer. Commentersindicated that in these instances, creditors do not know the loan programterms in advance and therefore cannot prepare program disclosures untilafter they conclude their negotiations with the consumer. They also expressedconcern that ``customized'' program disclosures might be needed to discloseeach individually negotiated program. Accordingly, an additional sentencehas been added to comment 19(b)(2)-1 to make clear that, in such cases,creditors may provide appropriate program disclosures as soon as reasonablypossible after the terms have been decided upon, but in no event laterthan the time a non-refundable fee is paid. Furthermore, with the flexibilityprovided in this commentary concerning disclosure of variations in loanmaturities, rate caps and frequencies of adjustments, the potential that``customized'' disclosures will need to be developed for each private bankingcustomer is significantly limited. Comment 19(b)(2)-2 has been revised to clarify that the term to maturityof an ARM loan does not constitute a program variation. This revision correspondsto the guidance provided in new comments 19(b)(2)(viii)-5 and 19(b)(2)(x)-2on the terms to maturity which may be used in calculating and disclosingthe historical example and the initial and maximum rates and payments.Comments 19(b)(2)-3 and -4 have been renumbered as comments 19(b)(2)-4and -5, respectively. Based upon public comment and to permit greater flexibilityfor compliance with the requirements, new comment 19(b)(2)-3 has been addedto describe the form for disclosures required under andSection; 226.19(b)(2).The Comment incorporates material previously contained in comment 19(b)(2)-1and includes new material which explains that a creditor may use eithera separate disclosure form to describe each ARM program it offers or adisclosure form which describes more than one available ARM program. Thecomment explains that the multiple program form must disclose if any programfeatures are available only in conjunction with certain other features.Finally, the new comment explains that multiple terms to maturity or multiplepayment amortizations may be illustrated in any program disclosure formwhether the form describes separate or multiple programs.<T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(iii). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(iii)-1 differs fromthe proposal in two respects. The use of the term ``balloon payment'' hasbeen replaced by a more specific reference to the type of transactionssubject to the disclosure provisions. The comment is revised to clarifythat, in transactions where paying the periodic payments will not fullyamortize the loan at the end of the loan term and where the final paymentwill equal the periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance, thecreditor must disclose that such a payment will be required. The creditor,however, need not reflect any irregular final payment in the historicalexample or in the disclosure of the initial and maximum rates and payments.(The exception for all irregular final payments is an expansion of theproposed comment, and would include final payments that differ in amountdue to the effect of rate changes.) <T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(v). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(v)-1 is revised to clarifythat consumer buydowns and third-party buydowns reflected in the consumer'scredit obligation should be disclosed in accordance with the rules fordiscounted variable-rate transactions. The revised comment also makes clearthat no additional disclosures relating to the buydown need be providedon the program disclosure. <T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vi). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1 is revised to addressthe disclosures for transactions in which the interval between consummationor closing and the initial adjustment is not known_for example, when ARMloans are grouped together for sale to a secondary mortgage market purchaser.In such cases, the comment explains that lenders may disclose the timingfor the first adjustment as a range of the minimum and maximum length oftime from consummation or closing until the first adjustment. <T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(vii). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 is revised toaddress the disclosures for transactions in which the overall limitationson rate increases (and decreases) vary_for example, based on the loan featuresthe consumer chooses or upon fluctuations in the pricing of the loan. Thefinal comment extends the alternative disclosure rule to periodic limitationsin addition to overall rate limitations. In such cases, the comment explainsthat the creditor may disclose the range of the lowest and highest periodicand overall rate limitations that may be applicable to the creditor's ARMtransactions, and must include a statement that the consumer ask aboutthe rate limitations that are currently applicable. <T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(viii). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(viii)-1 is revisedto clarify that, in transactions that end before the last year in the historicalexample, the example must illustrate all significant loan program termssuch as rate limitations that would have affected the interest rate forthe remaining years shown in the example. Comment 19(b)(2)(viii)-5 is added to describe the terms to maturity orpayment amortizations which may be used as a basis for the disclosuresin ARM transactions. Based upon public comment and further consideration,the proposed comment has been revised. Under the final comment, creditorswill be permitted to base the disclosures required under andSection; 226.19(b)(2)(viii)and (x) for ARM loans within certain ranges upon only three maturities_five,fifteen and thirty years. Thus, a creditor who offers ARM loans for anyterm over one year would be permitted to make the disclosures requiredunder these sections based on five-, fifteen- and thirty-year terms, andneed not illustrate every other maturity that is offered. The comment alsopermits creditors to use five-, fifteen- and thirty-year term assumptionsfor disclosing payments based on amortizations different than the actualloan term. (Disclosures based on fifteen- and thirty-year maturities shouldprovide payments that fairly approximate the payments for long-term ARMs.Disclosures based on a five-year maturity should provide payments thatfairly approximate the payments for most short-term ARMs. Finally, thecomment explains that the creditor would be required to state the term(or amortization) used in making the disclosures when using the three termsspecified in the comment.)  Comment 19(b)(2)(viii)-6 is added to explain that a creditor followingthe alternative rule for disclosing periodic and overall rate limitationsdescribed in revised comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 must base the historical exampleupon the highest rate limitation disclosed under andSection; 226.19(b)(2)(vii).In addition, such creditors must state the periodic or overall limitationused in the historical example.  Comment 19(b)(2)(viii)-7 also is added to explain the assumptions thatcan be made by a creditor following the alternative rule for disclosingthe frequency of rate and payment adjustments described in revised comment19(b)(2)(vi)-1. The comment explains that, in disclosing the historicalexample, the creditor may assume that the first adjustment occurred atthe end of the first year in which the adjustment could occur.  <T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(ix). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(ix)-1 states that a creditorshould base the example of how a consumer may calculate their actual paymentson the latest payment shown in the historical example. The comment is revisedto clarify that, in transactions where the latest payment shown in thehistorical example is not for the latest year of index values shown, acreditor may include additional examples that are based on the initialor maximum payments disclosed under andSection; 226.19(b)(2)(x). This revisiondiffers from the proposal in that it provides that creditors may providethe extra examples in addition to, but not as alternatives for, the examplebased on the last payment shown in the historical table. <T3>Paragraph 19(b)(2)(x). </T3>Comment 19(b)(2)(x)-2 is added to allowcreditors to base their calculations of the initial and maximum rates andpayments upon the terms to maturity stated in new comment 19(b)(2)(viii)-5.The comment explains that the term used for making disclosures under andSection;226.19(b)(2)(viii) also must be used in disclosing the initial and maximuminterest rates and payments.  Comment 19(b)(2)(x)-3 is added to describe how a creditor following thealternative rule for disclosing periodic and overall rate limitations describedin revised comment 19(b)(2)(vii)-1 would calculate the maximum interestrate and payment. In such cases, the comment explains that the creditormust base the disclosure of the maximum rate and payment upon the highestperiodic and overall rate limitation disclosed under andSection; 226.19(b)(2)(vii).The creditor would be further required to state the periodic and overallrate limitations used in calculating the maximum rate and payment.  Comment 19(b)(2)(x)-4 also is added to explain how to calculate the initialand maximum rates and payments if a creditor follows the alternative rulefor disclosing the timing of the first rate and payment adjustment describedin revised comment 19(b)(2)(vi)-1. The comment explains that the creditormust assume that the first adjustment occurs at the earliest time disclosedunder andSection; 226.19(b)(2)(vi). Section 226.20_Subsequent Disclosure Requirements <ITAG tagnum="81">20(b) Assumptions </ITAG>The proposed amendment to comment 20(b)-6 to add a cross reference to andSection;226.19(b) is deleted as unnecessary.<ITAG tagnum="81">20(c) Variable-Rate Adjustments</ITAG><T3>Paragraph 20(c)(4). </T3>Comment 20(c)(4)-1 differs from the proposalin that it replaces the term ``balloon payment'' with a more specific referenceto the type of transactions covered by the disclosure provisions. The commentis revised to clarify that the provisions of this paragraph apply to transactionsin which paying the periodic payments will not fully amortize the outstandingbalance at the end of the loan term and where the final payment will equalthe periodic payment plus the remaining unpaid balance. The comment explainsthat the creditor should disclose any change in such a payment that resultsfrom an interest rate adjustment.<T3>Paragraph 20(c)(5). </T3>Comment 20(c)(5)-1 is revised to clarify thatthe provisions of this paragraph apply only when negative amortizationoccurs in a transaction, and not merely because a payment is a non-amortizingor partially amortizing payment.Section 226.24_Advertising<ITAG tagnum="81">24(b) Advertisement of Rate of Finance Charge</ITAG>Although not reprinted in this notice, comment 24(b)-5 is revised to changethe references to comment 18(f)-8 to be comment 17(c)(1)-10. No substantivechange is intended.<ITAG tagnum="84">Subpart D_Miscellaneous</ITAG>Section 226.25_Record Retention<ITAG tagnum="81">25(a) General Rule</ITAG>Comment 25(a)-3 is added to address the record retention requirements forvariable-rate transactions that are subject to the disclosure requirementsof andSection; 226.19(b). The comment explains that maintaining written proceduresfor compliance with the disclosure provisions as well as retaining a sampledisclosure form for each loan program will be adequate evidence of compliance.The comment also states that creditors may rely on the methods for reconstructingthe required disclosures provided for under comment 25(a)-2.Section 226.30_Limitation on RatesComment 30-8 is revised to clarify that this paragraph applies to the mannerof stating the maximum interest rate in the credit contract only. Thisparagraph does not govern how interest rate ceilings should be stated inTruth in Lending disclosures. The disclosures are governed by provisionsfound elsewhere in the regulation and commentary.Comment 30-13, concerning footnote 50, is revised to clarify the requirementsof the regulation after October 1, 1988. For purposes of andSection; 226.30,the rate must be stated in the credit contract as prescribed in comment30-8. The disclosure requirements for limitations on rate increases aredescribed elsewhere in the regulation and commentary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix D_Multiple-Advance Construction Loans</ITAG>Although not reprinted in this notice, the first sentence of comment app.D-2 is revised to delete the word ``most'' and to change the referenceto andSection; 226.18(f)(4) to be andSection; 226.18(f)(1)(iv). No substantivechange is intended by either revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 226</ITAG>Advertising, Banks, Banking, Consumer protection, Credit, Federal ReserveSystem, Finance, Penalties, Rate limitations, Truth in lending.<ITAG tagnum="84">Text of Revisions</ITAG>Pursuant to authority granted in section 105 of the Truth in Lending Act(15 U.S.C. 1604 as amended) and section 1204 of the Competitive EqualityBanking Act, Pub.

For example, in a loan with an initial rateof 10 percent and a 5 percentage points rate cap, creditors should basethe disclosures on the initial rate and should not assume that this ratewill increase 5 percentage points. However, in a variable-rate transactionwith a seller buydown that is reflected in the credit contract, a consumerbuydown, or a discounted or preminum rate, disclosures should not be basedsolely on the initial terms. In those transactions, the disclosed annualpercentage rate should be a composite rate based on the rate in effectduring the initial period and the rate that is the basis of the variable-ratefeature for the remainder of the term. (See the commentary to andSection;226.17(c) for a discussion of buydown, discounted, and premium transactionsand the commentary to section 226.19(a)(2) for a discussion of the redisclosurein certain residential mortgage transactions with a variable-rate feature).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. <T3>Reverse mortgages.</T3> Reverse mortgages, also known as reverse annuityor home equity conversion mortgages, tpyically involve the disbursementof monthly advances to the consumer for a fixed period or until the occurrenceof an event such as the consumer's death. Repayment of the loan (generallya single payment of principal and accrued interest) may be required tobe made at the end of the disbursements or, for example, upon the deathof the consumer. In disclosing these transactions, creditors must applythe following rules, as applicable:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; If the reverse mortgage has a specified period for disbursementsbut repayment is due only upon the occurrence of a future event such asthe death of the consumer, the creditor must assume that disbursementswill be made until they are scheduled to end. The creditor must assumerepayment will occur when disbursements end (or within a period followingthe final disbursement which is not longer than the regular interval betweendisbursements). This assumption should be used even though repayment mayoccur before or after the disbursements are scheduled to end. In such cases,the creditor may include a statement such as ``The disclosures assume thatyou will repay the loan at the time our payments to you end. As providedin your agreement, your repayment may be required at a different time.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; If the reverse mortgage has neither a specified period fordisbursements nor a specified repayment date and these terms will be determinedsolely by reference to future events including the consumer's death, thecreditor may assume that the disbursements will end upon the consumer'sdeath (estimated by using actuarial tables, for example) and that repaymentwill be required at the same time (or within a period following the dateof the final disbursement which is not longer than the regular intervalfor disbursements). Alternatively, the creditor may base the disclosuresupon another future event it estimates will be most likely to occur first.(If terms will be determined by reference to future events which do notinclude the consumer's death, the creditor must base the disclosures uponthe occurence of the event estimated to be most likely to occur first.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; In making the disclosures, the creditor must assume thatall disbursements and accrued interest will be paid by the consumer. Forexample, if the the note has a nonrecourse provision providing that theconsumer is not obligated for an amount greater than the value of the house,the creditor must nonetheless assume that the full amount to be disbursedwill be repaid. In this case, however, the creditor may include a statementsuch as ``The disclosures assume full repayment of the amount advancedplus accured interest, although the amount you may be required to pay islimited by your agreement.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">andbullet; Some reverse mortgages provide that some or all of the appreciationin the value of the property will be shared between the consumer and thecreditor. Such loans are considered variable-rate mortgages, as describedin comment 17(c)(1)-11, and the appreciation feature must be disclosedin accordance with andSection; 226.18(f)(1). If the reverse mortgage hasa variable interest rate, is written for a term greater than one year,and is secured by the consumer's principal dwelling, the shared appreciationfeature must be described under andSection; 226.19(b)(2)(vii).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 226.18_Content of Disclosures</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">18(f) Variable Rate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Paragraph 18(f)(2)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Disclosure required. * * * </T3>(See the commentary to andSection; 226.17(a)(1)regarding the disclosure of certain directly related information in additionto the variable-rate disclosures required under andSection; 226.18(f)(2).)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section 226.19_Certain Residential Mortgage Transactions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">19(b) Certain Variable-Rate Transactions</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Coverage. * * * </T3>In determining whether a construction loan thatmay be permanently financed by the same creditor is covered under thissection, the creditor may treat the construction and the permanent phasesas separate transactions with distinct terms to maturity or as a singlecombined transaction.
