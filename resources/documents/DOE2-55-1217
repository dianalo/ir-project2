<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1217 </DOCNO><TEXT>X-ray images of a pair of active region loops are studied which show significant,short time-scale variability in the line fluxes of O VIII, Ne IX, andMg XI and in the 3.5-11.5 keV soft X-ray bands. Vector magnetograms andhigh-resolution UV images were used to model the three-dimensional characteristicsof the loops. X-ray light curves were generated spanning four consecutiveorbits for both loops individually, and light curves of the loop topsand brightest points were also generated. The largest variations involveflux changes of up to several hundred percent on time scales of 10 minutes.No significant H-alpha flare activity is reported, and loop temperaturesremain in the four to six million K range. The decay phases of the lightcurves indicate radiative cooling, inhibition of conduction, and sometype of continued heating due to ongoing, underlying activity at themicroflare level. 45 references.</TEXT></DOC>
