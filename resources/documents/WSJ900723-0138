Higher Education Assistance Foundation, a nonprofitcorporation based in Overland Park, Kan., last weekapproached the U.S. Department of Education and congressionalstaff, seeking approval for a federally-assisted takeover ofHEAF by another loan guarantor. People involved in the talkssay Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos has resisted approvinga merger because of concern about its costs to thegovernment.</LP><TEXT>   These people say HEAF could be forced to seek bankruptcyprotection unless it is allowed to merge or get some otherform of federal aid. HEAF's woes pose a threat of losses tobanks that made the loans it guarantees, to its creditors,and to the troubled student-loan program.   A failure by HEAF to meet its main obligation -- repayingbanks in the frequent cases of student defaults -- couldcause lenders to lose faith in other guarantors and stopextending credit. The student-loan program, with an estimated$13 billion in projected loans this year and $51 billion inloans outstanding, is the largest source of financial aid forpaying tuition.   HEAF declined to comment on its Washington negotiations orfinancial condition. The Education Department, in a writtenstatement, said HEAF &quot;is facing serious financial problems.&quot;The department also said it is &quot;closely monitoring&quot; HEAF, andadded, &quot;In the event HEAF is unable to solve its problems,the department is considering options, all of which willensure the availability of new loans and the continuation ofguarantees and claim payments on the loans.&quot; A departmentspokeswoman confirmed HEAF is seeking a combination withNebraska Student Loan Program Inc., which also declinedcomment.   The department said the situation &quot;will not affect theability of students to obtain loans, or of lenders to makethose loans.&quot; But others say that prediction's accuracydepends solely on whether the government comes to HEAF's aid.   &quot;The worry here is that banks will say, if HEAF can gobroke, all the other {guarantors can go broke, too,&quot; saidMark Wolfe, an analyst who has written reports on thestudent-loan program for state governments. If HEAF isn'taided, &quot;you will have lender reluctance settling in veryquickly,&quot; added one congressional aide who was briefed byHEAF last week. Banks have no direct claim on the federalgovernment for defaulted loans under the program.   One of HEAF's largest creditors is Student Loan MarketingAssociation, or Sallie Mae, a highly profitable company witha highflying stock. Sallie Mae, which extended an $865million credit line to HEAF last December, is one of thecountry's largest holders of student loans, which itpurchases wholesale from lenders.   Sallie Mae is also deeply involved in the negotiationswith the Education Department, according to student-loanofficials. Gisela Vallandingham, a spokeswoman for SallieMae, said, &quot;We ultimately expect the situation will beresolved so there is virtually no cost to Sallie Mae.&quot; Shedeclined to say how much HEAF currently owes Sallie Mae, orto answer further questions.   A spokesman for Citibank, the largest lender in theprogram, with about a 5% share, said the Citicorp unit hasn'thad problems receiving defaulted-loan reimbursements fromHEAF.   HEAF's troubles aren't new. It reported a deficit of $44.4million in the year ended last Sept. 30, and its chairman,Richard Hawk, has been struggling to reduce lending volume tostanch the red ink. Mr. Hawk's main problem is HEAF'sguarantee on a huge number of defaulted loans to students offor-profit trade schools.   Under the rules of the loan program, banks make loans tostudents that are guaranteed by HEAF and about 50 otherindependent guarantee agencies. When students default, thebanks submit claims to the agencies for reimbursement. Theagencies, in turn, are required to pay the banks and submitclaims to the Education Department for reimbursement.   HEAF's problem is that it has guaranteed so many loansthat are defaulting that it no longer qualifies for fullreimbursement. Once guarantors' default claims exceed 5% oftheir outstanding guarantees, they begin to receive onlypartial federal reimbursement. Thus HEAF is obligated to paybanks 100% of defaulted loan balances, but has lately beenreceiving only 80% of balances back from the government.   Net cash outflows at HEAF have hit $3 million a day,according to people involved in the Washington negotiations.HEAF told congressional staffers that it expects its cashshortfall in the next 12 months will be between $50 millionand $100 million, and about $300 million over time as claimsare made on all the problem paper on its books.   But people familiar with the loan program say no oneoutside of HEAF really knows how many defaulted loans it iscarrying or what its ultimate liability is. HEAF guaranteed$4.9 billion in what one of its own financial reports called&quot;high-risk trade school loans&quot; from 1986-1988, and many ofthese loans are now believed to be in default.   HEAF also told those it briefed last week that it hasunpaid claims outstanding with the federal government forabout $300 million. The federal government may also rejectclaims when it believes lenders haven't made sufficientefforts to collect. According to Education Department figuresreleased to lawmakers last week, HEAF's negative cashposition exceeded $60 million more than a year ago. A morerecent figure wasn't available.   HEAF wants a merger because Nebraska Student Loan Programreceives 100% repayment on defaulted loans, regardless of itsdefault volume. That's because Nebraska Student Loan is onlyfour years old, and federal law allows agencies to receive100% of default claims, with no conditions, for five years.   But Mr. Cavazos is said to be reluctant to extend theNebraska exemption to HEAF and its troubled guaranteeportfolio. HEAF's Mr. Hawk told congressional aides thatSallie Mae, as a major HEAF creditor, insisted on explicitEducation Department approval before agreeing to the Nebraskacombination.   Mr. Wolfe, the loan-program analyst, said that extendingthe Nebraska exemption to HEAF is legally questionable.&quot;That's a scam,&quot; said Mr. Wolfe. &quot;But of course, it makessense for HEAF.&quot;   The HEAF problems are likely to revive debate about theloan program, whose defaults are projected to grow to $2.3billion this year from about $1.4 billion in 1988. Mr.Cavazos must either back down from a get-tough Republicanpolicy toward defaults and accept an unknown bailout cost, orlet HEAF fend for itself and risk a loss of faith in the loanprogram.   The Education Department has said that lax practices bythe schools, banks and guarantors have led to the highdefaults. Democrats in Congress, meanwhile, say the EducationDepartment has been inept and unable to control fraudulenttrade schools who obtain loans for their students, thenprompt defaults by giving shoddy training or closing down.</TEXT></DOC>
