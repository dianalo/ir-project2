<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-88-0035 </DOCNO><TEXT>The GTA control system provides an environment in which the automationof a state-of-the-art accelerator can be developed. It makes use of commerciallyavailable computers, workstations, computer networks, industrial I/Oequipment, and software. This system has built-in supervisory control(like most accelerator control systems), tools to support continuouscontrol (like the process control industry), and sequential control forautomatic startup and fault recovery (like few other accelerator controlsystems). Several software tools support these levels of control: a real-timeoperating system (VxWorks) with a real-time kernel (VRTX), a configurationdatabase, a sequencer, and a graphics editor. VxWorks supports multitasking,fast context-switching, and preemptive scheduling. VxWorks/VRTX is anetwork-based development environment specifically designed to work inpartnership with the UNIX operating system. A database provides the interfaceto the accelerator components. It consists of a run time library anda database configuration and editing tool. A sequencer initiates andcontrols the operation of all sequence programs (expressed as state programs).A graphics editor gives the user the ability to create color graphicdisplays showing the state of the machine in either text or graphicsform. 11 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
