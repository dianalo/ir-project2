Coupled with $7.6 million in pay and stock optionsexercised in 1990, David O. Maxwell, 60 years old, receivedmore than $27 million on his departure, according to thecompany's proxy statement. A report of the payment appearedin the Washington Post yesterday.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It was the performance of the company from 1986 to 1989that generated the unusually high benefit,&quot; said Richard VanDusen, chairman of Fannie Mae's executive compensationcommittee. That benefit &quot;was based in very large measure onthe increase in the value of the stock.&quot;   When Mr. Maxwell took over the company in 1981, its stockwas trading at roughly $3 a share. It has since soared to ashigh as $48.50, and closed Wednesday at $47.875. During histenure, the market value of the company grew to $10.5 billionfrom $525 million.   Under his pension agreement, Mr. Maxwell was entitled toannual pension benefits equal to 60% of his averagecompensation during his three most highly compensated years.Part of his compensation during those years was tied to thevalue of the stock.   In the case of other senior Fannie Mae executives, the&quot;compensation&quot; figure used in the calculation is limited to150% of annual salary. But when Mr. Maxwell renogotiated hiscontract in 1986, that cap was lifted, allowing long-termincentive pay to be added to the base used in the formula.</TEXT></DOC>
