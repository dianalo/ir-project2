West German officials say the number of East Germans that havefled to the West since Hungary opened the floodgates on Sept. 11has surpassed 20,000.   As Communist East Germany nears its 40th anniversary, itsleaders say they are discussing reforms that could stop the flow ofrefugees to the West, a phenomenon that is draining the country'slabor pool.   The 77-year-old Honecker resumed some official duties Monday asabout 8,000 people demonstrated in Leipzig to protest hisgovernment's refusal Monday to grant legal status to apro-democracy group called New Forum.   Leipzig police arrested scores of demonstrators, many of whomsang ``We Shall Overcome,'' and shouted such slogans as ``Liberty,Equality, Fraternity!''   East Germany's state-run news agency ADN said Honecker, who hadnot been seen in public since Aug. 14, resumed some official dutieson Monday, meeting with the new ambassadors of Zimbabwe and Turkey.   East German Communist Party sources said the party chief wasexpected to fully resume his duties by Oct. 7, when the countrymarks its 40th anniversary. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachevis expected in East Berlin for the ceremonies.   After his mid-August surgery, some West German media reportssaid Honecker's condition may have been more serious than indicatedby East German officials and that he had lost the will to live.   The East German leadership has been hampered by Honecker'sprotracted recovery, leading one Communist Party official to callthe country a ``ship without a captain.''   West German media have said that some East German Communistleaders have accused Honecker of misjudging the meaning and scopeof the exodus to West Germany, which grants East Germans automaticcitizenship because its constitution does not recognize thedivision of Germany.   Honecker, a hard-line Communist who has led East Germany since1971, has staunchly resisted reforms sweeping much of the Sovietbloc.   As of early Monday, 20,130 East Germans had fled through Hungaryto West Germany since the channel to the West was opened, WestGerman border police said.   In addition, more than 1,200 East German refugees waited incramped West German Embassy compounds in Prague and Warsaw, hopinga diplomatic solution could be worked out to allow them to get tothe West.   East and West German officials spoke several times by telephoneMonday trying to reach a compromise on the embassy occupations,said Herbert Schmuelling, a West German government spokesman.   Bonn is hoping to find a quick solution and the talks are in a``highly sensitive phase,'' Schmuelling told reporters.   In Stuttgart, West Germany, the Communist Party chief for theEast German city of Dresden said he thinks changes are needed tostop East Germans from leaving their homeland.   Hans Modrow said he agreed with a recent remark by retired EastGerman intelligence chief Markus Wolf that the East Germangovernment must think over the causes of the East German exodus.   ``On this point I am of the same opinion as my friend MischaWolf,'' Modrow said on the first day of a four-day visit to WestGermany.   Modrow, however, refused to say what kind of reforms are neededin East Germany. ``This is something we have to discuss at home,not here,'' he said.   The number of East Germans occupying West German embassies inPrague, Czechoslovakia, and Warsaw, Poland, has nearly reached itssaturation point, West German government sources said.   About 980 East Germans have sought refuge inside the Praguecompound and 300 at the embassy in Warsaw, the sources said. Theirnumbers have grown by 50 to 100 per day over the past week.</TEXT></DOC>
