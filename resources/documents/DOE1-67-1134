Both are decisivelydependent on the relative response to the electromagnetic and the nonelectromagneticshower components, the e/h signal ratio, which should be equal to 1.0for optimal performance. The factors that determine the value of thisratio are examined. The calorimeter performance is crucially determinedby its response to the abundantly present soft neutrons in the shower.The presence of a considerable fraction of hydrogen atoms in the activemedium is essential for achieving the best possible results. Firstly,this allows one to tune e/h to the desired value by choosing the appropriatesampling fraction. And secondly, the efficient neutron detection viarecoil protons in the readout medium itself reduces considerably theeffect of fluctuations in binding energy losses at the nuclear level,which dominate the intrinsic energy resolution. Signal equalization,or compensation (e/h=1.0) does not seem to be a property unique to /sup238/U, but can also be achieved with lead and probably even iron absorbers.</TEXT></DOC>
