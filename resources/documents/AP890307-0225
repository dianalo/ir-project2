Not since former President Reagan fired 11,000 federal airtraffic controllers in an illegal strike in 1981 have the stakes ina strike been greater.   Reagan's action emboldened employers in the recession years of1981 and 1982 to demand wage concessions from workers and get them.Automatic inflation-indexed, cost-of-living adjustments that were afixture of labor contracts in previous decades disappeared from manysettlements in the '80s.   Steel, auto and rubber workers counting on $15 to $21 hourlywages took wage cuts, as did meatpackers and airline workers paidhalf as much.   Those who balked _ copper miners in Arizona, meatpackers inMinnesota or pilots and machinists at Continental Airlines afterFrank Lorenzo acquired it _ found themselves on the street, replacedby non-union workers often willing to work for half as much.   The return of national economic prosperity after the recessiondid not reverse the trend.   But through it all, two groups of union workers were able topreserve and in some cases even increase their wages relative toinflation: teachers and other state, county and municipal employees,and railroad workers.   The first group did it through a recognition that U.S.educational standards were falling, by using public sectorcollective bargaining laws enacted under President John F. Kennedy,and by demonstrating an ability to cut off vital public services.   Rail workers persevered largely through the 1926 National RailwayLabor Act, a law governing labor relations in both railroads andairlines and passed largely in an effort to stem union power throughgovernment intervention and maintain transportation vital tointerstate commerce.   Now, however, the labor movement is looking to the railway laborlaw it once vigorously opposed to lead it out of a decade in whichit lost more than a fourth of its members. Recent uses of the lawhave raised those union hopes.   The president and Congress have broad powers under the railwaylabor law to impose contract settlements on management and unionsthrough Presidential Emergency Boards. They lack those powers inother sectors of the economy.   Reagan used the mechanism several times, blocking threatenedrailroad strikes and effectively stifling management bids forconcessions.   And although the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act forbids striking unionmembers at one company from picketing another company, the SupremeCourt in 1987 upheld the legality of such secondary boycotts atrailroads and airlines.   Unions are counting on that combination to defeat EasternAirlines and Lorenzo, its principal owner, whom AFL-CIO PresidentLane Kirkland on Monday called the ``Typhoid Mary of union bustersin the transportation industry.''   It was Lorenzo who acquired Continental Airlines in 1981 and thendeclared bankruptcy two years later _ a move that allowed him tocancel all of the company's union contracts. Eventually all of theunion workers were replaced.   The Supreme Court later upheld Lorenzo's right to abrogateContinental's labor contracts under the bankruptcy statutes,creating a fear among labor leaders that the example could befollowed by any company.   The AFL-CIO spearheaded legislation passed by Congress in 1985changing the law, but ever since then Lorenzo has been at the top ofthe labor organization's enemies list.   Bringing an end to the favored tax treatment given debt-financedleveraged buyouts exemplified by Lorenzo's acquisition of Eastern in1986 has this year replaced trade at the top of labor's legislativeagenda.   Kirkland acknowledged the ``broad implications'' if Easternsucceeds in cutting the pay of its aircraft mechanics by $4,000 ayear and its ramp workers by $8,000 annually as demanded in thecompany's last offer before the strike Saturday.   ``There are no doubt those who are cheering him on in managementand certain circles in corporate America who want to see his tacticssucceed,'' he said Monday. ``This company is not in trouble becauseof the wages it pays _ labor costs at Eastern are lower than otherairlines operating profitably and efficiently.''   ``This company is in trouble because it's in hock to the bankssome $2.5 billion,'' Kirkland said. ``The interest cost on that debt... in excess of $800,000 a day ... is virtually equal to the amountthis company is losing.   ``This is not an atypical situation in American industry with thevast infection of leveraged buyouts and enormous debt loads thathave been saddled on otherwise good companies.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Matt Yancey covers Congress and was the AP'slabor writer from 1986 through 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
