Since detailed descriptions are available of reservoircharacteristics, field history before the inception of the CO/sub 2/project, planning and design, and facilities installations, these subjectsare reviewed only briefly here. The performance of the CO/sub 2/ projectitself since it began in Jan. 1972 is emphasized. In 1973, Chevron OilCo., SACROC Unit operator, conducted a 24-year history match of morethan 1,500 wells in Kelly-Snyder Field using a two-dimensional blackoil simulator. On the basis of this study, the estimated original oilin place in the SACROC Unit area was reduced to 2.113 billion STB (335.9Mm/sup 3/).</TEXT></DOC>
