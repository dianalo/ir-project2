Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell. &quot;With the exception of regulated companies, everything is fair game.&quot;    A few behemoths still seem too large for a takeover or buy-out; for example, there aren't any rumors about International Business Machines, which has a market value topping $73 billion.    But next to yesterday's $20 billion bid for RJR Nabisco, a lot of takeovers valued at $15 billion to $30 billion suddenly don't seem so preposterous.    Among the megadeal candidates bandied about by speculators yesterday were the giant retailers Sears, K mart and J.C. Penney, not to mention such familiar names as Chrysler, Mobil and Eastman Kodak. There was even talk floating around that American Telephone andamp; Telegraph might buy Digital Equipment.    &quot;I tell you, it's wild, all this stuff going on,&quot; says Frank Gallagher, research director at Phoenix Capital Markets, which does takeover analysis. &quot;There's never been a better period for arbitrage investment.&quot; He adds: &quot;It's also scary. Everybody's so euphoric, these transactions get me a little bit concerned.&quot;    Three companies have become more plausible as merger or buy-out candidates in the wake of last week's bidding, says Linda Zimbalist Smith, a Westport, Conn., valuation analyst. She puts leveraged buy-out values of $65 a share, or $26.8 billion, on Mobil; $70 a share, or $22.7 billion, on Eastman Kodak; and $42 a share, or $9 billion, on Chrysler. And the companies might fetch even more if they were acquired or merged, rather than going private in debt-financed management buy-outs.    The scale of possible takeovers took off when Philip Morris last week announced an $11.4 billion bid for Kraft. Less than three days later, RJR executives said they were exploring a $17 billion buy-out, a disclosure that sparked yesterday's $20 billion bid from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for RJR.    &quot;Times have indeed changed. People don't even pay attention to the price tag of a rumor anymore,&quot; says Robert Mittelman, head arbitrage trader at Oscar Gruss andamp; Son. While some market pros call the past seven days' bids a sign of speculative excess, Mr. Mittelman is willing to believe otherwise.    &quot;We're not talking about Irwin Jacobs maybe making a bid,&quot; he says, referring to the Minneapolis investor. &quot;These are blue-chip company managements making real bids for stock at a 50% premium. Instead of (being) at the end, we may be at the beginning of something.&quot;    Still, some traders cautioned against a euphoric feeling that the world has completely changed and that many big companies now will become takeover targets. &quot;This is the so-called heat of the moment. You make a projection of a trend,&quot; says Mr. Raiff of C.J. Lawrence.    He says that some surprise negative development, like a court setback for tobacco companies, could slow the takeover momentum. Mr. Raiff adds that takeover speculators are &quot;extremely vulnerable to bad news.&quot;    One common denominator among some takeover candidates is the perception that their managements can't profitably reinvest strong cash flow to build on a stable, established business.    If management keeps blowing big money on growth efforts that flop, acquirers start thinking they could use the same money to service takeover debt instead. Shareholders who reap gains from takeover bids can reinvest the money in companies with better growth prospects.    Take Polaroid, for example. Its management has spent lavishly to build on the instant-photo business. Some investors think that a lot of the money, for products such as instant movies, wasn't well spent. Time Inc. has become a takeover prospect because of questions about how it should reinvest cash from cable television and magazines.    One takeover specialist could be heard breathing heavily Monday, as he covetously described Procter andamp; Gamble, current market value $14.23 billion, as &quot;the fattest&quot; among big consumer products companies.    Sears, which has faltered in financial services, has seen its stock price rise on takeover or restructuring rumors, despite its market value of $16 billion. Over the past two months, its stock has risen to 42 5/8 from 35. Friday's volume was particularly heavy at 2.9 million shares.    Traders say talk about a buy-out of General Motors is still pretty far out. GM under Chairman Roger Smith has lost market share to its rivals and delivered subpar returns on billions spent on development and marketing.    While GM is huge by pre-RJR standards, with a current market value of almost $24 billion, that size isn't any longer unthinkable as a barrier. And as C.J. Lawrence's Mr. Raiff points out, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca said in his latest book that Chrysler and Allied-Signal once considered teaming up in a bid for GM.    Certain big companies might be somewhat protected by regulated segments of their businesses. Sears, ITT and Xerox, for example, have insurance subsidiaries that are regulated state by state. And GM bought Hughes Aircraft, a big defense contractor, in the mid-1980s.    As ITT Chairman Rand Araskog once acknowledged, some companies, including ITT, try to protect themselves by doling out investment banking business to many of the legions of merger advisers, in hopes of disqualifying them from a takeover advisory role, because of conflicts of interest.    Many buy-out candidates are characterized by stable, dependable cash flow that isn't likely to disappear in a recession. That is why companies in food, retailing and consumer goods pop up so often: Their customers still need food and clothing, even in a recession.    There are fewer takeover candidates among cyclical companies such as autos, steel, chemicals and paper products, because their results fluctuate more drastically with the economy. But some stocks sell at such low multiples of cash flow and earnings that they remain candidates.    Similar logic holds true for conglomerates with diverse businesses such as Allied-Signal and ITT, whose stocks trade at a below-average multiple of corporate earnings.    ---                       No Longer Too Big                    COMPANY (STOCK SYMBOL) SHARES                     PRICE            FIRM'S TOTAL OUTSTANDING             (at close)          MARKET VALUE                      General Motors (GM) 309.4 million              76 3/4           $23.74 billion                          Mobil (MOB) 411.5 million              45 5/8            18.77 billion                        Sears Roebuck (S) 379.3 million              42 5/8            16.17 billion                      Eastman Kodak (EK) 324.2 million              49 1/4            15.96 billion                     Procter andamp; Gamble (PG) 169.4 million              84                14.23 billion                          K mart (KM) 203.5 million              37 7/8             7.71 billion                         ITT (ITT) - 143.0 million              53 3/8             7.63 billion                      J.C.
