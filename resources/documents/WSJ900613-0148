Addressing the Soviet parliament, President MikhailGorbachev gave his broadest hint so far that Moscow couldenvisage certain conditions under which a united Germanycould be part of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Mr.Gorbachev repeated an earlier Soviet formula that Germanycould become an &quot;associate member&quot; of both NATO and theWarsaw Pact as long as this was done in conjunction with anoverhaul of the two military alliances as part of the Germanunification process.</LP><TEXT>   But in an apparent change from the earlier Sovietposition, Mr. Gorbachev dropped his insistence on EastGermany remaining part of the Warsaw Pact military structure.Instead, he said that during a transition period, the WestGerman army would be subordinated to NATO, while the EastGerman army would be subject to the new government of aunited Germany -- not to the Warsaw Pact. The new Germangovernment may well disband the East German army. However,Soviet troops would continue to be stationed on East Germansoil during the transition period, Mr. Gorbachev said.   His comments were presented in a hypothetical way anddon't constitute any major breakthrough in solving theproblem of a future security arrangement for Germany. TheSoviet leader previously has suggested that U.S. and Soviettroops should remain on German soil, and has frequentlycalled for major changes to the two military alliances.   But Soviet officials and Western diplomats said Mr.Gorbachev's comments are noteworthy because they signal astrong desire by the Kremlin to work with NATO in the searchof a face-saving security arrangement for Germany. As such,the comments represent a sharp turn from Moscow's tougherstance just a few weeks ago, when it rejected German NATOmembership and suggested that German neutrality was the onlyfeasible option.   &quot;It's important not to read too much into the content {ofMr. Gorbachev's remarks},&quot; said one German diplomat. &quot;But theSoviets are sending a signal to the world that serves its ownfunction.&quot;   In Washington, President Bush told reporters that the U.S.hadn't changed its position that a unified Germany should bein NATO with no conditions. In Brussels, NATO said in astatement that it would study Gorbachev's speech carefullybut that the idea of duel or associate membership &quot;does notseem promising.&quot;   The Soviet desire to reach a formula on German securitywas underscored at a meeting between Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze and his West German counterpart, Hans-DietrichGenscher, in the Soviet town of Brest on Monday. Details ofthe more than six hours of talks weren't disclosed. But Mr.Shevardnadze told a concluding news conference that, &quot;We seethe development of a very favorable setting for a mutuallyacceptable settlement of the military-political status of afuture united Germany.&quot;   Following the democratic revolution in East Germany lastfall, Moscow soon realized there was little it could do tostop German unification. But, as one of the four victoriousWorld War II powers, it could still drag its feet and disruptthe unification process. Many Soviet analysts say Moscowwould be unwise to do so because it would risk jeopardizingrelations with the new state from the start.   But Mr. Gorbachev has been under strong pressure fromhigh-level Soviet officials, both civilian and military, overhow to handle the security issue. Many say publicly that aunited Germany as part of NATO would be a severeforeign-policy blow, tantamount to &quot;losing&quot; East Germany.   &quot;There are numerous signs that NATO is using the newsituation on the continent to pursue its selfish aims,creating an imbalance of forces,&quot; Oleg Baklanov, a seniorCommunist Party official, told the Rabochaya Tribunanewspaper. &quot;Our Western partners would like to proceed frompremises that are advantageous only to them.&quot;   The U.S. and its allies have tried to take such concernsinto account. At a recent NATO meeting in Scotland, U.S.Secretary of State James Baker offered concessions that aredesigned to make German membership of NATO more palatable tothe Soviets. But many in Moscow say that these moves don't gofar enough, and they are seeking to use the German issue asleverage to bring about a fundamental change to the NATOalliance.   &quot;We need a more solid basis {for a future securityarrangement for Germany} than NATO, which is built onconfrontation with the Soviet Union,&quot; says Valentin Falin, aformer Soviet ambassador to West Germany who now plays animportant role in formulating Moscow's German policies. Hesays Mr. Baker's plans are &quot;generally positive, but so farthey are only ideas.&quot;   Mr. Gorbachev told parliament that, &quot;We can't accept thatthe West thinks movement should only come from our side.&quot;   The issue is immensely complicated by the Soviet Union'slove-hate relationship with Germany. Many Soviets are lookingto Germany to provide badly needed economic assistance. Thereare already strong rumors in Moscow and elsewhere that Bonnis considering offering large government credits to theSoviets, perhaps as the price for accepting East Germanmembership of NATO.   But hardliners in the Kremlin also have a potent argument:World War II, in which more than 20 million Soviets died.They use the war to warn of the dangers of an enlargedGermany and press home their arguments for tough termsconcerning a future security arrangement. &quot;We can understandthe Germans, who have waited 45 years {for unity},&quot; Mr. Falinsays. &quot;But we should be aware of worries that the expansionof Germany is linked with militarism. We must not forget thelessons of the past.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
