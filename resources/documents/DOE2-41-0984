Theworkshop presentations followed by discussion sessions addressed wetwaste minimization, installed radwaste equipment improvements, and dryactive waste volume reduction. Under wet waste minimization, the presentationsincluded bodyfeed addition to condensate polishing, root cause analysis,precoat filter optimization and evaluation of selective ion exchange.Installed radwaste equipment improvement lectures discussed project managementof radwaste retrofits, hollow fiber filters and the design and constructionof a solidification and dewatering facility at the Farley nuclear plantof Alabama Power Co. Reduction of dry active waste volume included presentationson alternative disposal of very low level radioactive waste, the wastesegregation program at River Bend, Florida Power and Light's radwasteminimization program and the radwaste minimization program at the H.B.Robinson station.
