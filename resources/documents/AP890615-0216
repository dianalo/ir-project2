West Germany's Mederer Corp., for example, makes Trolli Gummicandies in Iowa under a state program that reimburses a company upto 50 percent of a new worker's salary and benefits for on-the-jobtraining.   ``It was a major factor in locating the plant,'' manager GaryBuck says.   In the private sector, meanwhile, a new kind of democracy isemerging: a belief in lifelong self-improvement and a commitment tothe principle that anyone can have a good idea.   A potentially harmful counter-trend also is bubbling up, however.In the name of efficiency and uniformity, some companies are``de-skilling'' the jobs of fast-food laborers, reservation clerksand even bankers and social workers, removing their flexibility withrules concocted by centralized experts.   Yankee ingenuity is still admired around the globe. But thede-skilling movement is expanding too, fed by the management searchto exert control and avoid the vulnerability of relying onill-educated workers.   ``Extraordinary human ingenuity has been used to eliminate theneed for human ingenuity,'' author Barbara Garson writes in a 1988book, ``The Electronic Sweatshop.''   ``We call it cloning your best man,'' says George Keller,executive vice president of AFSM International, an association ofhigh-tech field service workers.   Keller says he likes the new systems, which allow generalists todo specialized repairs by following rules stored in a laptopcomputer. But he also worries people could become overly dependenton them.   ``People like to use crutches sometimes,'' he said.   There is no reason the knowledge economy must lead to drudgery.In fact, the assembly-line mentality catching on in some offices isdisappearing in the factories, where it began.   Respect for people's ideas at L-S Electrogalvanizing Co. inCleveland, for example, has led to a dramatic surge in pride amongthe company's workers, who make sheet steel for auto bodies.   Wes Humphrey, vice president of United Steelworkers Local 9126 atthe plant, says the esprit de corps there is so strong that ``now wewrap coils like it's Christmastime.''   Many managers recognize this lesson. ``If we don't work with ouremployees to make them happier and get more work out of them, we'reall doomed,'' says David Hoag, president of LTV Steel Co., one ofL-S's corporate parents, which got religion during its Chapter 11bankruptcy proceedings.   For companies that reject the de-skilling approach to survival,the alternative is shouldering more of the burden of education. Thatwill pinch smaller businesses that can't spare 18,000 people at atime, the number of IBMers who receive education or training on atypical day.   By the year 2000, 65 percent of all jobs will require sometraining or education beyond high school, compared with 54 percentnow, according to a study by the American Society for Training andDevelopment.   Many companies complain that their training will go to wastebecause newly trained workers will jump to jobs elsewhere. That isindeed a problem, since good training is so spotty. Still, trainingpays.   In a study for the National Academy of Engineering, Charles W.Hoover of New York's Polytechnic University concluded that educationoutlays for engineers are among the best investments, even in theshort term.   For workers, or those hoping to find jobs, the keys are lifelongeducation and flexibility.   ``Increasingly, we're in a more complex economy and that ismaking for more complex and more demanding jobs,'' says SamuelEhrenhalt, regional commissioner for the U.S. Bureau of LaborStatistics.   Unfortunately for those who want to adapt, it's getting tougher.American society is splintering into a small segment of overworkedtechnology wizards, a great mass of people who know just enough toget by, and another small but growing segment mired in permanentpoverty: the underclass.   Fourteen percent of American adults cannot locate the UnitedStates on a map. About one in five believes the sun revolves aroundthe Earth. Most young adults cannot decipher a bus schedule, aDepartment of Education survey found.   While American educators struggle to cultivate the seeds ofmodern knowledge in this country, foreign literacy is flourishing.   Japanese automakers that opened U.S. plants found they had tohire college graduates to fill assembly jobs that would have beenfilled by high school graduates in Japan.   Americans still win a disproportionate share of Nobel Prizes inscience, but by most other measures the top of the knowledge pyramidis eroding as badly as the base.   Last year, eight of the top 10 winners of U.S. patents wereforeign companies. Half the assistant professors of engineering atU.S. graduate schools are foreign.   As the U.S. economy becomes more closely tied to the global one,the winners will be those people whose services, for whateverreason, are in world demand. That includes movie stars, athletes,lawyers, and specialists like Michael Milken, the junk bond king.   Losers are those whose jobs can be done abroad. Data-entry jobsare moving to far-flung locales from Northern Ireland to China. Somecredit card and insurance companies have their billing statementsdone in the Caribbean. Boeing Co. has had programming done in thePhilippines.   Norman Bodek, executive director of the Data Entry ManagementAssociation of Stamford, Conn., was prophetic when he proclaimedthree years ago that eventually, ``An office in India will be nodifferent than next door.''   Perhaps the biggest direct threat to ordinary Americans is thatthe knowledge economy could permanently split the population andundermine any reason for the winners to help the losers. Thealienation and political consequences of that gulf are profound.   ``As our economic fates diverge,'' Harvard professor Robert Reichwrote recently, ``the top fifth may be losing the sense ofconnectedness with the bottom fifth, or even the bottom half, thatwould elicit such generosity.''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday June 25</NOTE></DOC>
