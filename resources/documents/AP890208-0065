(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A TV news editor hired away from his stationby a competitor has been charged with unlawfully entering thecomputer system of his former employer to gain access toconfidential information about news stories.   Using knowledge of the system to bypass a security shield hehelped create, Michael I. Shapiro examined and destroyed filesrelating to news stories at Tampa's WTVT, according to the chargesfiled Tuesday.   Telephone records seized during Shapiro's arrest in Clearwatershowed he made several calls last month to the computer line atWTVT, where he worked as assignment editor until joining competitorWTSP as an assistant news editor in October.   Shapiro, 33, was charged with 14 counts of computer-relatedcrimes grouped into three second-degree felony categories: offensesagainst intellectual property, offenses against computer equipmentand offenses against computer users. He was released on his ownrecognizance from Hillsborough County Jail.   If convicted, Shapiro could be sentenced to up to 15 years inprison and be fined $10,000 for each second-degree felony count.   Bob Franklin, WTVT's interim news director, said WTVT managementdiscovered several computer files missing on Jan. 12 and Shapiro wascalled to provide help. But Franklin said Shapiro claimed not toknow the cause of the problem.   ``Subsequent investigation has revealed that, at least sinceearly January, WTVT's newsroom computer system had been the subjectof repeated actual and attempted `break-ins.' The computers containhighly confidential information concerning the station's current andfuture news stories and the station's future story assignments,''Franklin said in a statement read at a news conference.   Franklin said Shapiro was one of two people who has hadresponsibility for daily operation and maintenance of the computersystem since it was installed about eight months ago.   ``The other is currently employed by us,'' Franklin said,referring to systems operation manager Cary Williams.   Terry Cole, news director at WTSP, said Shapiro has been placedon leave of absence from his job.   Shapiro did not respond to messages left at WTSP asking forcomment, and the station would not give out his home phone number.   Sam Jones, a spokesman for the Florida Department of LawEnforcement, said the agency's investigation determined that Shapirogained access to WTVT's computer on at least four occasions inJanuary by placing telephone calls from the rival station and fromhis Clearwater home, where a computer and WTVT's computer manualwere found during a search Tuesday.   ``There is no evidence or information to indicate that anyoneelse was involved other than Mr. Shapiro,'' Jones said.   Franklin said Shapiro, employed by WTVT from February 1986 toSeptember 1988, was not fired from the station but rather left toadvance his career at WTSP.   ``Mike was a very competent assignment editor,'' Franklin said.``He was very good at what he did. He left on good terms.''</TEXT></DOC>
