Patterson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ELE </IN><DATELINE> PARADISE VALLEY, Ariz.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The toughest traffic cop in these parts can write 20 speeding tickets a minute without chasing a car or even sounding a siren.    That's because the cop is a machine. Called photo-radar, the device is essentially a high-speed camera linked to a radar gun by a small computer. The camera snaps pictures of the speeding vehicles, and a few weeks later the owners get letters ordering them to pay up or show up in court. What makes the device particularly effective is that the gun, by shooting its beam across -- instead of along -- the highway, renders radar detectors useless.    Blasted by critics, who call it &quot;McTicket,&quot; photo-radar is just one new weapon in the escalating war between cops and speeders. Another weapon in the making uses infrared laser beams instead of radar. And some police forces are returning to old-fashioned, non-radar tactics.    The reason is that radar detectors have become such a roaring success. Makers estimate there are now about seven million of the devices in use across the country. And partly as a result, 43% of the vehicles on highways where the speed limit is 55 miles an hour are going faster than that, a federal study shows.    The detector industry has beaten back attempts to ban its products in all but three places -- Connecticut, Virginia and the District of Columbia. This has frustrated law-enforcement authorities to no end. &quot;Our membership strongly believes that the only purpose for radar detectors is to violate the law,&quot; says Ronald Sostkowski, a traffic specialist with the International Association of Chiefs of Police.    But the advent of photo-radar could mean high noon on the highways. The device has been used in Europe for more than a decade. Currently, only two U.S. communities are using it -- Pasadena, Calif., and Paradise Valley have had it for a year -- but about 100 other places are considering it, including King County, Wash.    Photo-radar is completely nondiscriminatory, says Manuel Fustes, president of Traffic Monitoring Technologies, the Friendswood, Texas, concern that leases the European-made device to users in the U.S. It photographs speeders without regard to race, sex or age -- or whether the vehicle is a jalopy or a flashy sports car.    Perhaps even more important, it's efficient. From January through August, the Paradise Valley unit issued 7,000 speeding tickets, twice as many as the town's 26-officer police force. Police officers like the system because it eliminates the need to approach a car that has been pulled over, a situation that always holds the potential for a deadly surprise.    However, it is precisely the lack of a traffic stop that makes the system illegal, its critics argue. Going after the owner of a speeding vehicle instead of the driver violates constitutional due process, contends Michael Malley, a Paradise Valley lawyer. &quot;It's illegal to drive a car too fast,&quot; he says, &quot;but it isn't illegal to own a car that is driven too fast.&quot;    Owners who weren't driving their vehicles at the time the photo-radar ticket was issued are supposed to go to court to identify the driver. But that doesn't always work, as illustrated when Mr. Malley represented the estate of a man who was issued a photo-radar ticket after he was dead (a relative had been driving the car). The judge dismissed that ticket, as he did in several subsequent cases Mr. Malley has challenged, without addressing the issue of constitutionality.    Lawyers aren't the only ones gearing up for an assault on the device. The detector industry's trade group -- Radio Association for Defending Airwaves Rights, or Radar -- has obtained its own photo-radar unit. The plan is to dissect the device and then figure out a way to beat it.    None of this deters the advocates of photo-radar, which Mr. Fustes insists is absolutely legal. &quot;It's a better mousetrap,&quot; he asserts. &quot;And the only people who don't like it are the mice.&quot;    The mice probably won't like having their speed checked by laser, either. International Measurement andamp; Control Co. will begin field-testing prototypes of its laser gun early next year, says David Williams, president of the Littleton, Colo., company. Radar detectors are useless against such a device because they don't detect lasers. Moreover, laser beams are far narrower than the waves emitted by radar guns.    To the detection industry, though, that means an opportunity to market an entirely new device. &quot;With electronics, anything they can do, we can undo,&quot; says Keith Urban, marketing manager for Cobra Consumer Electronics, a Dynascan Corp. division that makes radar detectors. Mr. Urban maintains that technology currently exists for a laser-detecting device.    Some law-enforcement officials are relying more on wits than on new technology. That's how Kentucky state police are slowing traffic on &quot;Death Hill,&quot; a stretch of northbound Interstate 75 that hurtles down into the Ohio River Valley. There they have installed modules that emit radar without police being present.    As drivers' radar detectors sound alarms, traffic slows. Police call it the &quot;halo effect,&quot; because drivers without detectors slow down as well. To keep the public honest, authorities periodically send officers to the area to write tickets.    Nor have police abandoned their older methods. Some police forces, for example, have stepped up use of a 20-year-old system called Vascar (Vehicle and Speed Computed and Recorded). Instead of radar, the system employs two odometers and two stopwatches; one set measures the police vehicle's speed, the other measures the suspect's. The Arizona Highway Patrol has 30 Vascar units on the road, three times as many as it did in 1980.    Amid all these options, police say the surest way of making a speeding citation stick is with the time-honored pace car method. That's where an officer follows a vehicle and estimates the driver's speed based on his own. Says Mr. Sostkowski, the traffic specialist, &quot;A policeman's testimony in court is still the best evidence.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
