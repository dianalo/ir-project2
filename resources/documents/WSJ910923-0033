Stertz   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/23/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A5</SO><CO>   F</CO><MS>CONSUMER CYCLICAL (CYC)</MS><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)</IN><RE>MICHIGAN (MI)NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   Ford Motor Co. backed off plans to boost base prices onmost 1992-model Ford Mustangs, and cut prices on optionalantilock braking systems to keep pace with a similar move byrival General Motors Corp.   The No. 2 U.S. auto maker, which is based in Dearborn,Mich., generally tinkered little with pre-introduction pricesset in July on 1992 models. The $14,980 introductory baseprice on the Ford Taurus L model, for example, is $1,628above the 1991-model's introductory base price. But it isonly $67 higher than the 1992 pre-introduction price Ford hadearlier given to dealers.</LP><TEXT>   Also, the $17,000 base price for the 1992 two-door,two-wheel-drive Ford Explorer Sport model increased $9 fromthe pre-introductory prices. The tentative price was $1,506,or 9.7% above the 1991 Explorer Sport model's introductoryprice. However, Ford did scale back price increasestentatively set for other 1992-model trucks. The base F150pickup truck will cost $10,928, or $847 below the 1992pre-introductory price; the 1992 Aerostar XL minivan willcost $13,739, or $262 less than the preliminary price.   The pre-introductory price Ford set on its base 1992Mustang LX cars were $566 above the $10,157 introductionprice on 1991 models. But the company pulled back from thoseplans and will offer the base Mustang LX model at the same$10,215 price the base model cost at the end of the 1991model year.   Ford also lowered the official 1992 prices on Lincoln TownCars as much as $336 from the pre-introduction prices,although those luxury models will still cost as much as$1,713 more than 1991 models.   Ford said the official 1992 prices will be effectiveThursday.   Ford's move to slash prices of optional anti-lock brakingsystems is a direct response to GM's plans to make the safetydevices standard equipment on some compact models and cutprices for the system it calls ABS VI on other cars.   On 1992-model Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable cars,anti-lock brakes will cost $595, down from the $985 price on1991 models. Prices for the braking systems on FordThunderbird and Mercury Cougar coupes will fall to $695 from$1,085 previously.</TEXT></DOC>
