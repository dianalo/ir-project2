Paul Sau-Ki Cheng and Edward Heath were convicted ofcharges related to Guaranty Federal's financing of a Floridaproperty owned by the two men's closely held company, PacificRealty Corp. Guaranty Federal was an affiliate of PacificRealty until the thrift failed in September 1988 with almost$2 billion in assets.</LP><TEXT>   Federal regulators attributed the thrift's failure torisky real estate ventures, such as the Florida deal, andMessrs. Cheng's and Heath's failed attempt to acquireHouston-based U.S. Home Corp. in 1986 through Pacific Realty.   The attempted takeover of U.S. Home resulted in about$68.5 million in losses at Guaranty Federal, according to acivil lawsuit pending against Messrs. Cheng and Heath andnow-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., which was U.S.Home's investment banker.   The lawsuit, filed in February in Dallas federal court bythe Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., also alleges thatMessrs. Cheng and Heath diverted profits from trading ingovernment securities to entities they controlled whilesaddling Guaranty Federal with losses from the trades.   The allegations in the civil lawsuit are unrelated to thecriminal charges on which Messrs. Cheng and Heath wereconvicted. The criminal charges included bank fraud,misapplication of thrift funds and wire fraud stemming fromGuaranty Federal's $10 million loan for the Florida property.   A portion of the charges dealt with false informationprovided by Messrs. Cheng and Heath in order to obtain aninflated appraisal of the Florida property to justify theloan. U.S. Justice Department prosecutor Robert Hauberg, ofthe Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force, said the convictions of thetwo men are significant because false-appraisal chargestypically are difficult to prove to a jury.   Mr. Cheng, 35 years old, was found guilty of 10 separatecharges and faces a maximum possible sentence of 70 years infederal prison. Edward Heath, 36, was convicted of 10 chargesand faces a maximum possible sentence of 80 years in federalprison.   Both men were acquitted of conspiracy and a handful ofother, lesser charges.   Guaranty Federal and two other failed Texas thrifts weresold in September 1988 to a joint venture led byTemple-Inland Inc. of Diboll, Texas. Temple-Inland has sincebought out its joint-venture partners and is sole owner ofthe thrift, now known as Guaranty Federal Savings Bank.</TEXT></DOC>
