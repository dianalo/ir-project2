Sterba's article about immigrants from India in the U.S. (page one, Jan. 27; letters, Feb. 5 and 18): There are two Indians in addition to Zubin Mehta who have made important contributions to the business and creative aspects of music in the U.S. One is Bhasker Menon, who, as chairman and chief executive of EMI-Music Worldwide, is directing the operations of one of the largest entertainment complexes in the world from his Hollywood office. The second is Ravi Shankar, who introduced Indian classical music to the West.    Many Indians of Punjabi origin settled on the American West Coast early in this century as a result of persecution by the British on account of their participation in a violent attempt to overthrow the British Raj. They became excellent farmers. It is ironic that, while these people left their homes to continue their fight for freedom of united India, today the most famous farmer of Indian origin in the U.S., Deedar Singh Baines, is actively advocating the cause of Khalistan and thereby indirectly helping the forces bent on disintegrating India.
