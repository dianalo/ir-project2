PoundStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDEST LATAMMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)AEROSPACE (ARO)EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Conservative activist Robert Owen testified that the Reagan administration gave him a role in its Nicaraguan &quot;humanitarian&quot; aid program from which he also assisted the secret Contra arms network overseen from within the White House.    Appearing before House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, Mr. Owen said he had been told an interagency group including representatives of the National Security Council, State Department and Central Intelligence Agency had made the decision to give him a State Department contract to work in the effort to provide so-called &quot;nonlethal&quot; aid to the Contras. At the time, Congress had prohibited U.S. military aid to the insurgents.    But Mr. Owen said that while under the contract, he continued to work for the arms network under directions from fired NSC aide Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, who was in close contact with then CIA director William Casey.    Mr. Owen testified he believed that &quot;Director Casey knew everything that Col. North was doing.&quot; He also said the former NSC aide had portrayed himself as the likely &quot;fall guy&quot; if the Contra operation was disclosed. Col. North was fired the day the administration announced that profits from secret U.S. arms sales to Iran had been diverted to the Contras.    From his position as a State Department contractor, Mr. Owen was able to travel frequently to Central America in 1985 and 1986. He said that on his trips he served as the &quot;eyes and ears&quot; of Col. North.    Mr. Owen's $50,675 State Department contract expanded his prior role as a private courier between Col. North and the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the dominant Contra group. But it also cast him in a difficult position between the often divided Contra political leadership and the private network operated by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.    Documents released yesterday by the committees reflect tensions between the Contras and their private suppliers. In a March 1986 memo to Col. North, Mr. Owen described complaints within the resistance about &quot;sweetheart deals&quot; and high prices charged by Gen. Secord's network.    The consultant himself was unsparing in his assessment of the Contra leadership. &quot;This war has become a business to many of them,&quot; he wrote. &quot;There is still a belief that the Marines are going to have to invade, so let's get set so we will automatically be the ones put into power.&quot;    In the same memo, Mr. Owen expressed concern about potential abuses within the humanitarian aid program, including unverified receipts and black-market currency transactions authorized by the FDN leadership.    Mr. Owen also had some criticism for the CIA. In a February 1986 message to Col. North, he complained that an airplane provided to the Contra supply operation by a private contractor linked to the agency had been involved in drug traffic in the past. &quot;Part of the crew had criminal records,&quot; Mr. Owen wrote. &quot;Nice group the Boys (CIA) choose . . . Incompetence reins.&quot;    In two days of testimony before the congressional committees, the fervent idealism of the young activist contrasted with the roles he was asked to perform. Mr. Owen laced his remarks with references ranging from Thomas Jefferson to David and Goliath, as he described making cash payments to Contra political leaders and running tens of thousands of dollars for Col. North and Gen. Secord from New York to Washington.    In the months before he obtained his State Department contract in October 1985, Mr. Owen was paid from accounts controlled by Adolfo Calero, the FDN leader. But throughout his involvement in the Contra aid effort, his principal supervisor appears to have been Col. North.    Mr. Owen testified that at the direction of the NSC aide, he made an estimated $30,000 in payments to between six and 10 political leaders in the Nicaraguan resistance. He also said he traveled three times to New York for Col. North and Gen. Secord to pick up money transferred by wire from abroad. At the time, Gen. Secord was using accounts in Switzerland for the covert Contra supply network.    Mr. Owens said he twice picked up envelopes of money at a New York bank. Though investigators are uncertain as to what bank was used, Gen. Secord's business partner, Albert Hakim, has had past dealings with Republic National Bank.    Mr. Owen said he delivered the funds in both those instances to Col. North. He said that on another occasion, when the banks were closed because of a Jewish holiday, he traveled to New York's lower west side to pick up money at an Oriental corner market. Following Gen. Secord's instructions -- including using a code name for who had sent him -- Mr. Owen said he was greeted by a person who went behind the counter and pulled a bunch of hundred dollar bills from his pantleg.    &quot;He gave the whole wad to me and he asked me if I wanted to count it,&quot; Mr. Owen testified, adding that the sum came to $9,500 -- a figure just below the level that would have to be reported to the government if deposited at a bank or brought into the country. Mr. Owen said he delivered those funds to Gen. Secord. Mr. Owen indicated too that he may unwittingly have carried money in 1984 and 1985 from Mr. Calero to Col. North.    Although Mr. Owen at times served both Col. North and Mr. Calero, the former NSC official was clearly the dominant force in Mr. Owen's activities.    Mr. Owen testified that he doubted the Contras could ever militarily defeat the Nicaraguan government. In one memo disclosed at the hearing he described Mr. Calero as a &quot;creation&quot; of the U.S. government and someone who has surrounded himself with people who are &quot;liars&quot; and motivated by &quot;greed.&quot; By comparison, he described Col. North as his &quot;Godfather.&quot; Among the nicknames he used for the Marine was &quot;Bandamp;G&quot; or &quot;Blood and Guts.&quot;    Mr. Owen got the endorsement of the Contra leadership, including Mr. Calero, for his effort to obtain his State Department contract, but he himself wrote the letter of endorsement. At the same time, Col. North was pushing behind the scenes for Mr. Owen to get the contract, and after first balking, State Department officials relented.    In a rare display of criticism, Mr. Owen accused people in the White House of attempting to discredit Col. North. Without naming anyone, he charged that they had leaked information on Col. North's medical record and had painted him as a &quot;cowboy.&quot; He said that &quot;slowly but surely&quot; it is emerging that others in government besides Col. North were involved in the Contra operation.    On another matter, Mr. Owen acknowledged that he had destroyed some papers relating to his work in support of the Contras. But once he received subpoenas from Congress and criminal investigators, he said, &quot;I didn't throw away anything.&quot;    Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), asked Mr. Owen why Col. North personally cashed some traveler's checks, which he received from Mr. Calero, at food stores and gas stations in the Washington area. Mr. Owen said he didn't believe that Col. North had used the money for personal expenses. Sen. Hatch also said that Col. North had used the checks to buy $1,000 in airline tickets and to give Mr. Owen $1,000 when Mr. Owen was married.    Col. North repeatedly has refused comment on the Iran-Contra affair. Investigators for the committees are trying to determine if he used any of the traveler's checks for his own benefit.    Mr. Owen testified that Col. North kept a ledger of his disbursements of traveler's checks. But investigators said the ledger wasn't found in Col. North's office, and could be one of the items destroyed in what has been described in earlier testimony as Col. North's &quot;shredding party.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
