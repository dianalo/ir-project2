Pickup 11th graf, `Scotland Yard...'</HEAD><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   British Airways promised today to punish thoseresponsible for letting a jumbo jet fly with explosives left onboard by a bomb-detection team during a drill.   The incident sparked a new controversy over airline securityafter the Dec. 21 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103.   A cleaning worker found the gelignite, which officials saidcould flare up but not explode, aboard the Boeing 747 on Monday atLondon's Heathrow Airport, said Independent Television News, whichbroke the story Wednesday night.   The flight had just returned from a flight to Toronto.   Police confirmed the incident, saying one of theirbomb-detection teams inadvertently left the explosives on boardafter using the aircraft in an exercise to train sniffer dogs.   The Department of Transport said today it has called for anurgent report. British Airways chairman Lord King promised ``a mostthorough and detailed investigation,'' saying: ``If heads fall,they fall.''   An airline spokesman, Derek Ross, said cleaners found thesubstance under a seat at the rear of the plane. ITN news said itwas left there for about two weeks, during which the Boeing 747made several journeys.   Today, airport sources said it was believed the package wasplaced in a seat pocket and then slipped through into theupholstery.   The latest controversy follows widespread charges that TranpsortSecretary Paul Channon was lax about sending airlines warningsabout a new type of radio cassette bomb before the Pan Am Flight103 disaster on Dec. 21 that killed 270 people.   Flight 103, which originated in Frankfurt, was blown up overLockerbie, Scotland, after taking off from Heathrow. Authoritiesbelieve a bomb was encased in a radio-cassette player.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has defended Channon, butspeculation remains that she will drop him from the Cabinet laterthis year.   Scotland Yard said police use British Airways planes forexplosive-search training from time to time.   Police Inspector Andrew Nielson said the explosive weighed lessthan a pound and measured about 4 inches by .8 inch.   He said the substance was incapable of exploding by itself and``at the very worst it could flare up if ignited by fire. Nobody atany time has been placed in any danger.''   But lawmaker David Wilshire, a member of the governingConservative Party and whose constituency includes the airport,said British Airways was responsible for the incident.   ``I'd say to BA ... there's evidence growing by the week thatyou aren't carrying out your responsibility properly,'' Wilshiresaid in a radio interview. ``The buck stops with BA on thisoccasion.''   ITN last week showed videotape taken by three youths who saidthey boarded an empty British Airways jumbo jet at Heathrow onMarch 20 without being challenged. The video included a shot of oneyouth sitting in the captain's seat.   British Airways said it regarded the incident as ``extremelyserious,'' but stressed it took place in a maintenance area and notthe operational area.   The opposition Labor Party's spokesman for transport, JohnPrescott, called for a new supervisory security body at Heathrowand accused the police of sloppiness. ``It's a breakdown yet againof simple procedures,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
