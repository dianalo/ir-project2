Mailing address: FAA, NorthwestMountain Region, 17900 Pacific Highway South, C-68966, Seattle, Washington98168.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>A proposal to amend Part 39 of theFederal Aviation Regulations to include an airworthiness directive, applicableto Boeing Model 737 series airplanes, which requires accomplishment ofa terminating modification on all lap splices and along Stringer 17, whichincludes installation of protruding head solid fasteners, was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on November 1, 1988 (53 FR 44163).Interested persons have been afforded an opportunity to participate inthe making of this amendment. Due consideration has been given to the commentsreceived.The Air Transport Association (ATA) of America, commenting on behalf ofits members, suggested that the proposal be withdrawn or the compliancetimes extended because the proposed short compliance times are not justifiedby one report by one operator of a 12-inch crack found in an area of aprevious repair. The FAA does not concur. Although the report of a 12-inchcrack in an area inspected 6 months prior to discovery further emphasizesthe FAA's determination that widespread cracking in lap splices cannotbe adequately maintained by inspection, the FAA's proposal is based primarilyon the numerous reports of cracking received. The FAA has determined thatrivet replacement will eliminate the risk of undetected cracks joining,which can result eventually in an uncontrolled decompression of the airplane.This AD action is, therefore, both justified and appropriate.As a result of extensive FAA efforts following the accident in Hawaii inApril 1988, which involved a Model 737 series airplane, it became apparentthat widespread, multi-site cracking was not being discovered to the degreeof assurance necessary to maintain safety of the aging transport airplanefleet. This, coupled with a better understanding of the human factors associatedwith numerous repetitive inspections, has caused the FAA to place lessemphasis on repetitive inspections and more emphasis on material replacement.Thus, as aircraft begin to show the signs of multi-site damage and otherindications of structural aging, the FAA has decided to require airplanemodifications necessary to remove the source of the particular aging phenomenon.This is in lieu of the previous position of continual inspection and repair/modificationon condition if cracks are found. This final rule is in consonance withthat policy decision.Two operators requested that the compliance time for accomplishment ofthe terminating modification in the area between body station (BS) 259and BS 360 be extended to 4 years or 80,000 flight cycles, whichever occursfirst, based on the minimal reports of cracking in this area and reducedload levels. The FAA concurs with the commenters and has determined that,because of the lesser loads in this area, the modification can be delayedwithout adversely impacting safety. Paragraph B. of the final rule hasbeen revised accordingly. The FAA has determined that this change willneither increase the economic burden on any operator nor expand the scopeof the AD.Two operators requested that the compliance time be extended so that themodification may be accomplished at the first heavy maintenance visit afterthe accumulation of 70,000 flight cycles. The FAA does not concur. In lightof the fact that there have been reports of multiple site cracking on airplaneswith as low as 45,000 flight cycles, the FAA has determined that extensionof the proposed compliance time for modification, as requested, cannotbe justified.One operator requested that the compliance time be extended so that themodification may be accomplished within 15 months following inspectionwith high frequency eddy current. The FAA does not concur. The FAA hasdetermined that, due to evidence of widespread cracking, the integrityof the lap splices cannot be assured by currently required inspection techniques,which have not been successful in some cases. For this reason, an aggressiveschedule to modify the splice configuration, regardless of inspectionspreviously accomplished, is necessary.One operator commented that the proposed rule should only apply to thelap splices at Stringers 4 and 10. The FAA does not concur with the commenter,since evidence of multiple site cracking has been reported at lap splicesother than at Stringers 4 and 10. Additionally, all splices have the potentialfor structural failure if widespread cracking is allowed to remain undetected.Transport Canada commented that the terminating modification has not beenshown to be adequate. The FAA does not agree with this commenter. The terminatingmodification will correct the basic design inadequacy of the lap jointsby removing the knife edge due to countersunk fastener installations. Further,the designed fail-safe capability will be verified by assurance of thetearstrap bond, as required by paragraphs A.1. and A.2.Transport Canada also questioned the rationale of the proposed schedule.The FAA chose a schedule that would aggressively minimize the potentialfor future structural failure or rapid decompression due to lap splicemultiple site cracking. The proposal requested comments on more appropriateschedules and received various comments. As noted above, the proposed schedulehas been revised due to one of the comments received on this subject.One operator commented that the problems associated with fairing clearanceand installation of protruding head fasteners need to be resolved. TheFAA has determined that the lap splice modification will not be compromiseddue to fairing interference. The manufacturer has developed fairing reworkinstructions to resolve this problem, and will revise its service bulletininstructions to add these instructions.One operator requested that any alternate means of compliance approvedfor the terminating modification of AD 88-22-11, Amendment 39-6059 (53FR 44163; November 1, 1988) should be approved for the proposed rule aswell. AD 88-22-11 requires external and internal inspections of the skinalong certain fuselage skin lap joints and bonded doublers; the terminatingaction provided for in that AD is identical to the modification requiredby the proposed rule. The FAA concurs and has revised paragraph E. of thefinal rule to specify that accomplishment of the requirements of this ADconstitutes terminating action for the requirements of AD 88-22-11, andthat any alternate means of compliance previously granted as terminatingaction for AD 88-22-11 is considered approved alternate means of compliancefor this AD as well.Paragraph A.2. of the final rule has been revised to clarify that the areawhere tearstraps must be assured to be functional is ``one bay above andbelow S-17;'' the Notice had inadvertently specified this area as ``twobays above and one bay below S-17.''Paragraph C. of the final rule has been clarified to specify the referencedsubparagraph of paragraph A. as ``A.1.''Paragraph D. of the Notice incorrectly referenced Boeing Service Bulletin737-53-1089, Revision 1, as one source for repair procedures for cracksfound in the skin along the lap joints. That reference has been deletedfrom this paragraph in the final rule.After careful review of the available data, including the comments notedabove, the FAA has determined that air safety and the public interest requirethe adoption of the rule, with the changes previously described. The FAAhas determined that these changes will neither increase the economic burdenon any operator, nor will they increase the scope of the AD.There are approximately 291 Model 737 series airplanes of the affecteddesign in the worldwide fleet. It is estimated that 100 airplanes of U.S.registry will be affected by this AD, that it will take approximately 2,016manhours per airplane to accomplish the required modifications, and thatthe average labor cost will be $40 per manhour. Based on these figures,the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $8,064,000.The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, the FAA has determined that this regulationis not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979); and it is further certified under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act that this rule will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities, becausefew, if any, Model 737 airplanes are operated by small entities. A finalevaluation has been prepared for this regulation and has been placed inthe docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Aviation safety, Aircraft.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection;39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 39.13) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
