Chemical proposed to acquire Texas Commerce for $36 a share, in cash and securities, but the final price will depend on the Houston-based company's financial performance over the next several years. And one feature of the transaction isolates some of the Texas banking company's nonperforming loans into a separate entity.    The announcement ends months of speculation about which money center bank would become the first to take advantage of a Texas law enacted in September that allows out-of-state takeovers of Texas banking companies. Texas banks have been hit with heavy loan losses as the sharp drop in energy prices has hurt businesses in the region.    While Texas Commerce's profits have been diminished by problems of the Texas economy, they haven't been hurt to the extent of other large Texas banks. For the first nine months of this year, Texas Commerce's $840 million in nonperforming loans represented an unhealthy 6.5% of total loans, and its net income fell 50% from a year earlier, to $41.2 million, or $1.25 a share. But despite its difficulties, Texas Commerce is still considered one of the best-managed banks in the Southwest. Ben Love, chairman and chief executive officer of the Texas bank, will be joining Chemical's board.    Based on current figures, the transaction would create the nation's fourth-largest banking company, with about $75 billion in assets, narrowly edging out J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Chemical New York currently is the nation's seventh-largest banking company, with $56 billion in assets, compared with Texas Commerce's holdings of $18.9 billion. The previous largest banking combination was the $1.08 billion acquisition in June of Crocker National Corp. by Wells Fargo andamp; Co., San Francisco.    The complex transaction, which banking experts say could be a model for similar mergers, was designed to protect Chemical shareholders from further deterioration in Texas Commerce's loan portfolio, while enabling Texas Commerce shareholders to benefit from possible improvements in the Houston-based company's earnings.    Mr. Love conceded that Texas Commerce had recently had a tough time competing with other banks because his bank's cost of funds was higher than the cost for large money-center banks. &quot;Texas banks have been, in essence, red-lined over the past two years,&quot; Mr. Love said. &quot;It has been painful to us, and inhibited us.&quot; As part of Chemical, however, he said the funding problem would evaporate. &quot;I think it's going to be one great marriage,&quot; he said. He said the separate class of stock tied to Texas Commerce earnings will be a &quot;tremendous incentive&quot; to improve the company's earnings.    Terms call for each Texas Commerce share to be exchanged for $7 in cash, 0.09 share of Chemical New York -- valued at about $4, one share of a new issue of Chemical adjustable preferred stock with a stated value of $12, and one share of a new issue of Chemical Class B common stock convertible into Chemical common, the value of which will depend on the Texas bank's financial performance from 1987 through 1991.    In addition, Texas Commerce holders will receive shares in a new entity that will have as its only assets about $300 million, or one-third, of Texas Commerce's nonperforming loans. Chemical estimates that the convertible stock ultimately will be valued at about $10 a share, while a share in the special entity will be valued at $3. Analysts, however, questioned whether the convertible common and the special entity shares would have that high a value.    James J. McDermott Jr., director of research at Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said, &quot;It gives Chemical an edge in one of the largest markets in the country. Whether their timing is appropriate will depend on how they've valued Texas Commerce's shares.&quot; Mr. McDermott estimated the value of the new Class B common at between $4 and $9 a share and the value of the special entity at about $2 a share.    Mark Alpert, bank analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., said, &quot;It's a risky acquisition that's part of Chemical's expansion strategy, but it's not as desirable in our opinion as expansion in the Northeast.&quot; He added that &quot;if Texas Commerce thought they had identified most of their problems and the worst was behind them, selling out at book value would be a low price.&quot; At Sept. 30, book value of Texas Commerce was $35.83 a share. Currently, about 33.3 million Texas Commerce shares are outstanding. He estimated that the transaction would dilute Chemical's per-share earnings by about 10% to 15% in the first year.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Texas Commerce shares, which had traded below $24 a share last Tuesday, closed at $27.25, up 75 cents, on 1.1 million shares. Chemical shares fell 87.5 cents to $43.50 in Big Board trading, on 1.7 million shares. On Friday, Texas Commerce surged $2.75 to close at $26.50 in heavy trading, apparently in response in rumors about a possible merger.    Chemical and Texas Commerce insist that the combination will produce immediate benefits, notably savings of at least 15 basis points, or 0.15 of a percentage point, on Texas Commerce's cost of funds. Because of uncertainties about their future prospects, Texas banks generally have been paying a premium for large certificates of deposit and other liabilities.    The savings in borrowing costs are expected to be realized because Chemical is a larger, stronger institution with wider access to global funding sources.    Moody's Investors Service Inc. said the agreement, if completed, could lead to a possible downgrading of ratings on Chemical's $1.3 billion of debt, and to a possible upgrading of ratings on Texas Commerce's $250 million of debt.    Chemical, known for its expertise in serving consumers and middle-market companies, expects to help Texas Commerce expand its retail banking operations, an area in which Texas Commerce isn't considered strong. Chemical's chairman, Walter V. Shipley, said, &quot;Our experience in product development on the consumer side is a major plus for them.&quot; Additionally, he said Texas Commerce would provide Chemical another outlet for such services as investment banking and cash management. Although the move into Texas appears to represent a departure from Chemical's often stated strategy of focusing its expansion efforts in the Northeast, analysts said the transaction is also consistent with Chemical's interest in making inroads into major markets with large deposit concentrations.    Mr. Shipley said that the two institutions began discussions involving the acquisition more than three months ago and that their boards approved the transaction over the weekend. A number of other major money-center banking companies are said to have held discussions with Texas Commerce in recent months. One of them, Chase Manhattan Corp., is understood to have dropped out of contention because of uncertainties about the Texas economy generally and Texas Commerce's portfolio in particular. Speaking from Houston, Mr. Shipley said, &quot;We see a two to three-year continued slowness here before recovery picks up.&quot;    Thomas Donovan, vice chairman of Marine Midland Banks, which has also moved to acquire banking companies outside New York, called the announcement &quot;a bit of a stunner. I would have expected Citicorp or Chase.&quot; But he added that &quot;Chemical got a good deal for one of the largest banks in the third-largest state in the Union.&quot; Mr. Donovan said that while Marine Midland was interested in a possible acquisition in Texas as recently as a year ago, it now is focusing on expanding its banking operations in the Northeast. Earlier this year it agreed to buy Philadelphia-based First Pennsylvania Corp. when banking laws permit.    The accord is a landmark in efforts by New York banks to expand out of state. New York banks have been blocked from making acquisitions in many states by regional banking compacts, which allow out-of-state acquisitions by banks in some states but not others. New York institutions such as Citicorp, Chase and Marine Midland have taken advantage of legislation in some states that opens the door to New York banks, as well as federal legislation that permits out-of-state takeovers of failing banks and thrifts. But the Chemical transaction so far is the largest of these moves.    It also marks the third major thrust by Chemical itself to acquire banking institutions out of state. In May, Chemical agreed to acquire Horizon Bancorp, New Jersey's fifth-largest banking company, as soon as banking laws permit. Also pending is a 1982 acquisition agreement with Jacksonville, Fla.-based Florida National Banks of Florida Inc. to merge when law permits. Although analysts said the Texas Commerce acquisition could limit Chemical's ability to make future investments, including out-of-state acquisitions, Mr. Shipley said, &quot;It doesn't impede our ongoing investments in the New York region or investment in building our capital markets strength.&quot; He said it wouldn't preclude a possible acquisition in California by 1991 when that state's law permits acquisitions by New York banking companies.    The transaction, which is expected to be completed in the 1987 second quarter, is subject to approval by bank regulators and shareholders of both companies. Holders will vote on the proposed combination at the companies' regularly scheduled annual meetings in April. Texas Commerce would retain its name, operating as an independent unit of Chemical New York Corp., the parent of Chemical Bank.    ---                   THE TWO BANKS         (For nine months ended Sept. 30)                      CHEMICAL    Net income                   $300 million    Earnings per share           $5.65    Return on assets             0.70%    Total assets                 $55.99 billion    Total deposits               $33.56 billion    Primary capital              $4.32 billion    Equity capital               $3.05 billion    Total nonperforming loans    $1.402 billion             TEXAS COMMERCE BANCSHARES    Net income                   $41.2 million    Earnings per share           $1.25    Return on assets             0.30%    Total assets                 $18.26 billion    Total deposits               $13.45 billiono    Primary capital              $1.50 billion    Equity capital               $1.19 billion    Total nonperforming loans    $840 million</TEXT></DOC>
