However, the main error of the passage lies in your repeatedly expressed penchant for one-man rule. (You once compared Mr. Reagan with a king surrounded by evil lords, as if the problem with kings is that they don't have enough power.) Congressmen individually may represent individual constituencies, but they don't act individually; they act in concert. As a whole, they represent the nation. That the president is one man means that large sections of society are left out (for instance, all Democrats). Only in Congress do all voices have a chance to be heard.    If the president, moreover, turns out to be a total disaster (and you will admit that some presidents have been, even if you don't think this one is), then there is nothing in the executive branch to stop him from doing great harm. It is unlikely that the people would elect 535 disasters to Congress.    Democracy is not to be able to choose one's dictator, but to be free from all dictators. In a democracy, one should be bound only by laws made by a body capable of reproducing the nation in small, and no one should, by virtue of his office, be considered above the law or beyond reproach.    Daniel A. Krasner   Berwyn, Pa.   ---   Maybe you're right! A superpower can't be run by a committee of 435 members. Maybe we need a presidential dictatorship like they have in Mexico in order to remain a superpower.    But I prefer the constitutional system of checks and balances set in place by our Founding Fathers as the best alternative to dictatorship and the best system to preserve individual rights and liberties.    If that part of the world that depends on our leadership to preserve its liberty doesn't like it, then so be it. The rest of the world can always elect to make the same sacrifices Americans willingly do to preserve their liberties rather than depend on America for a &quot;free ride.&quot;    Richard J.
