Measurements are performed on random assembliesof chemically coprecipitated barium ferrite powders. The magnetic stiffnessfor both minor and major loops of the hysteresis cycle is measured andcompared with calculated curves based on the model of coherent rotation.The discrepancies between theory and experiment are partly due to theeffect of magnetic interaction.</TEXT></DOC>
