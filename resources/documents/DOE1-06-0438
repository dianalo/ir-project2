The gamma rays aredetected at the body surface by a variety of instruments that convertthe invisible rays into visible patterns representing the distributionof the radionuclide in the body. The patterns, or images, obtained canbe interpreted to provide or to aid diagnoses, to follow the course ofdisease, and to monitor the management of various illnesses. Scanningis a sensitive technique, but its specificity may be low when interpretedalone. To be used most successfully, radionuclide scanning must be interpretedin conjunction with other techniques, such as bone radiographs with bonescans, chest radiographs with lung scans, and ultrasonic studies withthyroid scans. Interpretation is also enhanced by providing pertinentclinical information because the distribution of radiopharmaceuticalagents can be altered by drugs and by various procedures besides physiologicand pathologic conditions. Discussion of the patient with the radionuclidescanning specialist prior to the study and review of the results withthat specialist after the study are beneficial.</TEXT></DOC>
