Specificobjectives were: (1) Build a model that estimates how the level of effortsby the contractors in a basin will vary as physical properties, government'stax rate, and hydrocarbon prices vary. The basic assumption underlyingthe model is that a contractor adapts his efforts in an attempt to maximizehis discounted profit. (2) Use the model to analyze the impact of theGovernment's tax policy in each Indonesian basin. The model consistsof three submodels: discovery, development and economics. The main programuses these three submodels iteratively to determine optimum investment,which give maximum net revenue for the contractors, as a function oftax rate and hydrocarbon price for each basin in Indonesia. Remainingrecoverable reserves up to the contractors' economic limit and to government'seconomic limit were calculated for each of the 40 known basins in Indonesia.As expected, the following conditions cause calculated recoverables toincrease: (1) higher hydrocarbon prices; (2) higher fraction of discoveredgas developed and sold; (3) lower cost in a basin; (a) less remote area,(b) shallower sea, (c) shallower formation; (4) higher fraction of oilin a basin (oil is more profitable than gas).</TEXT></DOC>
