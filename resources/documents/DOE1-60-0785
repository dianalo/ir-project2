Their investigationshave been concerned with people of many different ethnic origins, coveringa wide geographical area, from India and Sri Lanka in the west, throughMalaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and New Guinea, to the central Pacificin the east. Population structures of the peoples studied range alsofrom small tribal enclaves within larger communities, or isolated islandpopulations through to populations with well defined social castes ofwide dispersal. The genetic variability is equally varied, and the geneticrelationships between these populations is complex, being a compoundof diversity of origins, migration and intermixture, and adaptation toparticular environments. Certainly they do not yet fully understand thiscomplexity, but they have unravelled some part of it, enough now to seewhat needs to be studied further. These studies have covered human populationsin the tropics. This does not mean that all live in a uniform environment.Their habitats vary from tropical rain-forest to desert, from sea levelto several thousand metres elevation. Their economic base likewise covershunter-gatherers, slash and burn cultivators, to settled agriculturalistsand urban dwellers. Sometimes ecological differences are broadly based,as in India and South-East Asia, sometimes they occur within a smallgeographic area.</TEXT></DOC>
