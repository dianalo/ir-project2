Talkabout, a telephone company service linking strangerstogether for chats in groups of up to 10 at a time, was forced tohang up permanently this week under a barrage of public criticism.   For British Telecom, the country's main telephone company,Talkabout was a gold mine. The company's privatization in 1984after decades of state ownership has made it far moreprofit-conscious and Talkabout earned it up to $17.5 million a year.   But parents complained Talkabout rang up huge phone bills.Members of Parliament claimed it had become a dating service anddrug exchange. Lurid tales circulated of girls being seduced byolder men and of young neo-Nazis pouring out racist hatred.   While the tabloid press highlighted the sensational aspects ofTalkabout, the Office of Telecommunications (OFTEL), the phonecompany's watchdog body, warned that British Telecom's monopolyprivileges would be reviewed unless customers could have Talkaboutblocked from their lines.   British Telecom said the cost would be prohibitive and on Mondayit stopped the service.   No one claims to have actually heard the service being seriouslyabused, and British Telecom hotly denies the seduction stories. Ifanything, say critics who called in to hear Talkabout forthemselves, the conversations generally were dull and witless.   Nonetheless, Terry Lewis, a lawmaker for the opposition LaborParty who campaigned against Talkabout, insisted ``the service isobscene, dangerous, addictive and costly.''   Costly, definitely. At up to 71 cents a minute at peak time,Talkabout cost eight times more than an ordinary call.   Addictive, perhaps. Youngsters calling in to a radio talk showsaid they sometimes spent up to four hours a day on Talkabout.   But obscene and dangerous? British Telecom says the serviceattracted 40 million calls but only 27 complaints since itsinception in 1983.   ``We provided a quite innocent and socially useful pastime tomany thousands of customers,'' the company said in a statementannouncing Talkabout's closure.   British Telecom says it was prepared for trouble from theoutset, and built in safeguards.   Conversations were limited to 10 minutes and separate servicesexisted for teen-agers and for adults.   A tape recording warned callers not to divulge surnames,addresses or phone numbers during conversation, and about 200monitors stood by at the 25 Talkabout exchanges around the country,ready to step in and cut off abusers.   ``None of that,'' a monitor would interject the moment aconversation looked like veering into smut or racism. ``You knowthe rules. If you won't behave I will cut you off.''   But conversation was often an unintelligible mish-mash ofcompeting voices. Even if an interesting conversation got going,the 10-minute rule soon guillotined it.   The notion of Talkabout as a battering ram against the fabledreserve of the British character was ``one of our theories,'' aBritish Telecom spokesman said, insisting on anonymity citingcompany rules.   ``People sit opposite each other on the train five days a weekgoing to work and never talk. Some of them would probably love ananonymous chat on Talkabout,'' he added.</TEXT></DOC>
