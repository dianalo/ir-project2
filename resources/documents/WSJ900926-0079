Nevertheless, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, in releasingthe department's annual review of the Soviet military, warnedthat the Soviet Union remains a military threat that must becountered.</LP><TEXT>   The ninth edition of Soviet Military Power reported a cutof between 6% and 7% in weapons procurement spending, ahalving of tank production to 1,700 from 3,500, and lessercuts in the output of fighter planes, bombers, artillery andother important weapons. It also disclosed a &quot;dramaticdecrease&quot; in Soviet space launches and predicted that Moscowwill scrap as many as 450 navy ships by 1996 and cut 80,000sailors from its navy.   The slick book still features photos of menacing Red Armyweapons, just as it has since it was first issued by theReagan administration to gather public support for themilitary buildup of the 1980s.   But this year, the book also included photos of Soviettroops leaving Eastern Europe, Soviet missiles beingdestroyed to comply with arms-control treaties, and Sovietbombers whose tails had been cut off to make them unusable.   The report, however, repeatedly noted that in some weaponscategories, especially strategic nuclear weapons, Moscow iscontinuing to build strength and that even reduced outputlevels for items such as tanks still top Western productionrates. It also stressed that the Soviets still field theworld's largest military force.   &quot;What it does not reveal, no matter how much we might wishit,&quot; said Mr. Cheney, &quot;is an eviscerated Soviet forcestructure and an evaporating threat . . . The Soviet Unionremains an enormous military superpower.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
