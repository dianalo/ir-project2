Dozens of parliamentarians have asked to speak on the report andseveral are likely to vote against it. However, governmentofficials and parliamentarians say it will probably be adoptedFriday.   The joint Gabcikovo-Nagymaros project has met considerableopposition in Hungary and dozens of independent environmental andother interest groups have publicly called for a halt inconstruction.   The groups claim it will cause irreparable ecological damage towetland and wildlife along the Danube and pollute large drinkingwater reserves.   Marothy, however, told Parliament the barrage system ``must bebuilt in keeping with the original concept.''   ``The government must take responsibility for society as awhole, even if the price of this is that it must act against theopinions of some groups,'' Marothy said.   Marothy argued the issue has become largely symbolic in Hungaryfor other social problems.   ``What has become superimposed on these disputes is the sum oftensions, social problems and contradictions emerging, ...including claims for remedying grievances that have nothing to dowith the dam,'' he said.   On Sept. 12, about 20,000 people gathered in front of Parliamentto protest the project, calling for democracy, a multiparty systemand a referendum.   Marothy rejected the conclusions of an ad hoc committee of theAcademy of Sciences which presented its findings to the governmentOct. 1, charging they were ``inaccurate.''   The Academy report, as quoted by Marothy, said stopping ordelaying construction posed a ``realistic alternative'' andpostponing work could reduce economic burdens and entail fewerenvironmental risks.   He said a total cost to Hungary of finishing the project wouldamount to about $700 million. Net revenue from the project by theyear 2015 would amount to the same, Marothy said.   Austria is financing part of the Hungarian side of the projectin return for electric power.   In another development, Hungary's foreign minister said at theUnited Nations on Thursday that Romania, its Warsaw Pact ally, isguilty of human rights violations, but said Moscow was not takingsides in the Hungarian-Romanian dispute.   The conflict revolves around Romania's ethnic Hungarianminority, which Hungary says is being systematically mistreated ina resettlement program.   Foreign Minister Peter Varkonyi avoided naming Romania in aspeech Tuesday to the General Assembly, limiting himself todecrying ``cultural oppression'' of minorities in ``neighboringcountries.''   But in an interview Thursday, he said: ``It is clear that ourproblem in this regard is with Romania.''</TEXT></DOC>
