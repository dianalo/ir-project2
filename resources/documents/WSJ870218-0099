But Channel Four Television, Britain's youngest national TV channel, has done just that, with a small budget. The films have gone on to critical and financial success in theaters. And now, they are the surprise hit of this year's Oscar nominations.    David Rose, senior editor, has chosen the station's dramatic offerings since it went on the air in 1982. A soft-spoken, professorial gentleman, he ranks today among Britain's most influential movie moguls. He has used Channel 4's modest drama budget to spur development of Britain's independent movie industry, funding talented young writers and directors. The result has been TV fare a cut considerably above the usual standard -- and more than a few box-office sleepers such as last year's &quot;My Beautiful Laundrette.&quot;    Channel 4 has backed more than 100 movies in the last five years. While Britain's established studios floundered with turkeys like &quot;Revolution&quot; and &quot;Absolute Beginners,&quot; first-time writers and directors made reputations and occasionally even money. Neil Jordan, a novelist, wrote and directed his first movie for Channel 4 a few years ago and went on to direct last year's &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; the gangster-and-love story with Bob Hoskins, who won an Oscar nomination for his performance, and Michael Caine.    Stephen Frears, who directed two earlier films for the channel, scored the channel's biggest hit yet with &quot;Laundrette,&quot; a love story about a Pakistani entrepreneur and a tough English punk. The movie, made on a $1-million budget that was modest even by Channel 4's standards, got theatrical distribution after an enthusiastic reception at the Edinburgh Festival two years ago. The screenplay by Hanif Kureishi is now up for an Oscar.    Another Channel 4-supported film, the Merchant-Ivory adaptation of E.M. Forster's &quot;A Room With a View,&quot; also did surprisingly well at U.S. box offices last year and has received eight Oscar nominations. The same team is now shooting Forster's &quot;Maurice,&quot; his gay novel that long went unpublished.    Other Channel 4 titles include Merchant-Ivory's &quot;Heat and Dust,&quot; &quot;Another Country,&quot; &quot;Wetherby,&quot; &quot;Letter to Brezhnev,&quot; &quot;Cal&quot; and &quot;The Sacrifice,&quot; a co-production with Sweden's Film Institute.    Channel 4 and the rise of Britain's independent-production sector are among the unsung successes of Thatcherite Britain. The station was chartered by Parliament to provide an alternative to Britain's existing commercial network and the publicly financed British Broadcasting Corp. It functions as a quirky but workable mix of public service and private enterprise. The money comes, no questions asked, from the other commercial channel, which sells ads on Channel 4 and pockets the proceeds.    The enterprise comes mostly from hundreds of small production outfits that have sprung up outside the heavily unionized, bureaucratic broadcasting establishment and that vie for Channel 4's money. Channel 4, though a nonprofit body owned by the government, keeps itself lean; spreading an annual budget of 10 million pounds ($15.3 million) among its 15 or so projects a year enforces stringent spending discipline. Most producers enlist partners, though the station pays for 100% of a few productions each year. Any film that can get theatrical distribution is permitted to take advantage of the offer, for as long as it lasts, before Channel 4 shows it.    Channel 4's offerings largely reflect the personal tastes of Mr. Rose, who spent 26 years producing series and TV plays for the BBC before leaving to join Channel 4. Mr. Rose and an assistant review some 2,500 scripts a year -- most but not all from British writers -- looking for 15 or so with promise. The station initially rejected &quot;Mona Lisa,&quot; in part because Mr. Jordan was already established, but then later bought the broadcast rights to the film as it neared completion.    Mr. Rose scrutinizes budgets carefully, cutting down on the number of limousines. Directors aren't allowed to spend more than five or six weeks shooting. &quot;We tell them they've just got to get on with it,&quot; Mr. Rose says.    Channel 4 has helped break down the barriers between film and television, tapping the reserves of British broadcasting and advertising talent. More of Britain's theatrical talents are crossing over, too. Mr. Rose says this year's most exciting movies include &quot;Hidden City,&quot; a mystery that marks the directing debut of Stephen Poliakoff and may carry Channel 4's banner at Cannes this spring. Mr. Poliakoff's latest play, &quot;Coming in to Land,&quot; opened at the National Theatre last month starring Maggie Smith.    Channel 4 the movie mogul has stayed largely in the background, satisfied by a brief mention in the credits. But at the U.S. Film Festival in Utah last month, the channel showcased four of its newest movies.    The only one of the four as yet released in Britain is &quot;Eat the Peach,&quot; a typically untypical example of Channel 4's tastes. The movie is one of the channel's occasional international projects, a co-production with Ireland's national film board.    The movie, directed by a TV veteran named Peter Ormrod, is set in the middle of a peat bog, not a very pretty place to make a movie. It concerns the efforts of two men to build a &quot;Tower of Death,&quot; a drum-shaped centrifuge designed for daredevil motorbiking. They get the idea out of an old Elvis Presley movie, and finance the project by smuggling beer and petrol across the Northern Irish border.    The picture isn't wildly hilarious, but it has a wacky sort of humor and a lovable nature. It is nice spending time with these characters, and visiting their obscure corner of the world. There's a humanity in it that's missing all too often from the British blockbuster, even a beautifully shot British blockbuster such as &quot;The Mission.&quot;    Fortunately, there appears to be no danger that Channel 4 will itself turn to blockbusters in the wake of its recent successes. &quot;We are in the low-budget film business,&quot; Mr. Rose says, &quot;not in the gambling business.&quot;    ---   Mr. Marcom is a reporter in the Journal's London bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
