Cutting capital-gains taxes and modifying catastrophic health care defy compromise. Differences on anti-drug spending add budget uncertainty. Indiana Rep. Hamilton calls the fiscal 1990 budget deliberations &quot;awful and deteriorating&quot; as lawmakers approach the Oct. 16 deadline that would trigger automatic spending cuts.    Probable amendments to legislation to raise the federal debt ceiling above $3 trillion by Oct. 31 compound budget worries. Texas Sen. Gramm wants to set deficit goals through fiscal 1999 and remove the Social Security surplus from the calculations after fiscal 1993. Budget chief Darman argues for reducing the deficit first and tinkering with the law later.    Meeting next fiscal year's deficit goal will be even tougher because of plans to expand Medicaid and build prisons.    BANK TROUBLES could follow the path of savings and loans, some experts warn.    The banking industry is shakier than regulators have let on, critics contend. The FDIC expects bank failures to total about 200 this year; it rescued 220 last year, when its bank-insurance fund registered the first loss ever -- more than $4 billion. Regulators have about 1,000 banks with $100 billion in assets on their &quot;problem&quot; list.    &quot;It is possible that losses in the commercial banking industry could eclipse those of the thrift industry,&quot; Robert Litan of Brookings Institution and Dan Brumbaugh of Stanford say in a paper. Regulators say that the fears are overstated and that problem banks are on the decline. The issue will be examined next week by a subcommittee headed by Rep. Annunzio.    BENTSEN BOOSTS his presidential hopes by seeking to sharply expand IRAs.    The Texas senator's call to increase the tax-deductible savings plans rather than cut the capital-gains tax wins praise. &quot;It's great politics,&quot; says Democratic consultant Greg Schneiders. IRAs would benefit more voters than a capital-gains tax cut mainly for the wealthy. The idea, predicts Democratic strategist Horace Busby, &quot;will help push Bentsen out front for 1992.&quot;    Bentsen's move gives Democrats an alternative to Bush's drive to cut the capital-gains tax. He still needs a victory on the plan to score big, but even a close defeat would be a political plus. &quot;Maybe, after all, the Democrats do have a triple-digit IQ,&quot; says GOP theorist Kevin Phillips.    Bentsen, who analysts think has decided to run for president, is scheduled to speak at a major political dinner next month in Iowa.    INTERNAL SQUABBLING slows two NATO proposals that the U.S. had hoped to present when conventional arms-reduction talks with the Soviets resumed last week. Greece balks at limits on troop movements that might interfere with its testy relationship with Turkey. Italy and France object that tight verification on arms plants might spill their foreign-trade secrets.    GUN CONTROLLERS intend to take a shot at helping fight the war on drugs by pressing gun restrictions. Advocates such as Ohio Sen. Metzenbaum consider cracking down harder on assault weapons. But the administration resists anti-gun moves.    FRUITFUL EXCHANGE? Israel nears an agreement to export fruit and vegetables to the Soviet Union. In return, Tel Aviv is expected to seek steps to encourage the direct emigration of Soviet Jews to Israel. Currently, most Jews who leave the Soviet Union don't end up in Israel.    DISEASE DEBATE? The nation's AIDS research chief, Anthony Fauci, worries about a possible &quot;backlash in funding&quot; for AIDS because of competing demands for cancer and heart research. The government will spend $1.31 billion this year to research AIDS, which will kill about 34,000 Americans, compared with $1.01 billion to study heart disease, which will kill about 778,000.    CONGRESS DIGS for more dirt in the HUD scandal as Kemp ponders reforms.    A House subcommittee explores contradictions to testimony by former HUD Secretary Pierce, who in an about-face canceled a planned appearance today. Democrats hope to show in later hearings that the Reagan White House had a hand in doling out funds to Republican faithful. The panel also will probe a former Denver HUD official, Michael Queenan, who donated $100,000 to the GOP last year after getting HUD subsidies for projects in which he had a stake.    HUD chief Kemp considers changes being debated internally: rental subsidies that would lead to home ownership, and creating nonprofit groups to generate federal mortgage insurance business in inner cities. Another idea: Encourage pension funds and insurance companies to invest $1 billion each in low- and moderate-income housing.    Those who believe &quot;the time has come for a major change in the direction of national housing policy,&quot; says one memo to Kemp, &quot;are waiting for a leader.&quot;    MINOR MEMOS: Recalling his Democratic Convention fiasco, Arkansas Gov. Clinton jokes that speeches by governors are being discouraged at Bush's education summit for fear &quot;I'm going to give the one I gave last year.&quot; . . . Rep. Lantos, who is probing the scandal at the Department of Housing and Urban Development, hits the speaker circuit with a speech he dubs &quot;The Long HUD Summer.&quot; . . . Begorra] Included in an interest group's list of Italian-Americans in Congress is Sen. Patrick Leahy; his mother was Italian. </TEXT></DOC>
