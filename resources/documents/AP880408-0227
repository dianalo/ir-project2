The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index rose 12.6points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,773.6 at midday.   Volume was light at 259.3 million shares at midday compared with261.9 million shares at the same time Thursday.   The commercial banks announced a cut in their base lending rateby half a percentage point to 8 percent, the lowest level in morethan a decade.   The banks cut the benchmark rate, effective Monday, after thecentral bank reduced its own money market rate by 0.375 percnet to8 percent, apparently to stem the British pound's advance.   ``That's what we want, some more good news like that,'' said onedealer, referring to the reduced interest rates. ``It should bejust the tonic the market needs'' to take it higher.   The dealer said the market had been sluggish all morning, heldback in part by major new share issues by Tate and Lyle PLC to helpfinance a tender offer for Staley Continental Inc. of the UnitedStates and a huge issue announced by Barclays Bank PLC on Thursday.   Other dealers were more wary of the benefits to equities fromthe interest rate cuts, saying the lower rates revive fears ofinflationary pressures on Britain's economy.   One dealer also noted that the pound failed to show markedreaction shortly after the rate cut was announced, dampening thepositive sentiment in the equity market.</TEXT></DOC>
