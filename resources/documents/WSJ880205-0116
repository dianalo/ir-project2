But the central bank also ruled that banks should treat the bonds as Mexican risk, even though the bonds are to be secured by 20-year, zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds.    The decision means British banks are likely to approve waivers letting Mexico proceed with the plan before a deadline set for today. But British bankers said the central bank's guidelines won't reduce their unwillingness to tender Mexican debt for bonds by another deadline of Feb. 19.    The Bank of England's guidelines &quot;are largely academic,&quot; one banker said, because the large discount the banks are expected to take when tendering their loans will discourage British banks, whose provisions against the loans aren't as large as those of some European and U.S. regional banks.    A banking official said British banks will be expected to make provisions against the bonds only if Mexico's ability to service them deteriorates. </TEXT></DOC>
