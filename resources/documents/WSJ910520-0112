I share that view andhave, in my brief tenure at General Dynamics, sought ways toturn the principle of &quot;pay for performance&quot; into realitythroughout our company.   In February, we implemented an incentive compensationplan, linking managers' compensation directly to corporateperformance. The purpose of this is to build a culture of&quot;shareholder partnering,&quot; joining the interests of inside andoutside shareholders.</LP><TEXT>   One element of the plan is a gain-sharing provision thatgives senior executives annual bonuses equal to their basesalaries, under one condition: that General Dynamics stocktrades for 10 consecutive days at a price at least $10 ashare above where it stood when the plan was adopted. On May6, that condition was met. Nineteen senior managers shared ina pool of roughly $5.1 million. To encourage long-termthinking, a large percentage of each senior manager's sharewill be held in a General Dynamics' account (tied to companyperformance) until he reaches age 65.   If we expected to be applauded for linking in such a boldand direct manner shareholder value with executivecompensation, we were mistaken. One securities analyst calledthe bonuses a &quot;windfall&quot; for senior management. Apparently,the naysayers are not impressed with the $580 millionincrease in General Dynamics' stock market value betweenmid-February, when a share stood at $25.50, and May 6. Theyoverlook the fact that this bonus package is less than 1% ofthat total increase in shareholder value. And they do notshare the view of nearly 80% of our shareholders, who votedon May 1 to support the incentive compensation plan.   Lost in the controversy is one simple fact: At least halfof each bonus paid as a direct result of increasingshareholder value must remain in a General Dynamics account,the value of which we intend to link directly to thecompany's long-term performance until the individualparticipant reaches age 65. In fact, all of my bonus and ourpresident's bonus have been held back and placed in thatcompany account. Consequently, every manager who is part ofgain-sharing has a continuing, tangible incentive to work toincrease shareholder value over the long term.   Although pay-for-performance compensation plans stand ontheir own merits, we implemented General Dynamics' plan aspart of a wider strategy to adapt to the wrenching changesaffecting the defense industry. We must motivate ouremployees to build shareholder value in the face of ashrinking market and employment decreases throughout ourindustry. That is no easy task, but that is precisely wherethe incentive compensation plan comes in. All of ouremployees must learn to think and act like shareholders. Ifwe can accomplish this, then the &quot;partnering&quot; of employee andshareholder interests will result in financial rewards forboth, rewards that are tied to the long-term success of thewhole organization.   Apart from the gain-sharing program mentioned for our topmanagers, we have begun to institute this kind of thinkingamong our next level of employees. Our new compensation planwill require the company's 1,000 top- and middle-levelmanagers to put at least 10% of their 1991 bonuses in aGeneral Dynamics tax-deferral plan. This will increase to 25%of their bonus packages in 1993. The long-term value of thisplan is based upon General Dynamics meeting specificcompanywide, long-term performance goals.   This encourages employees to take a long-term view, toremain with General Dynamics, and to continue working forshareholder value the entire time they are with us. Andrecent revisions to our savings- and stock-incentive plans,also as part of the incentive compensation plan, stimulatestock ownership among all employees so that they directlybenefit from increases in shareholder value.   I'm encouraged that, thus far, 42% of all employees haveelected to convert their investments in their savings- andstock-incentive plans into stock. One employee, ShirleyWilson, who works in quality assurance at our Air DefenseSystems division, hit the nail on the head when she recentlytold us: &quot;When we do a good job, the results show up in ourdepartments, divisions and the corporation by way ofhigh-quality, low-cost competitive products. As a result, thecompany becomes a more viable investment, which increasesshareholder value and the employee-SSIP shareholderbalances.&quot;   That our new culture of &quot;shareholder partnering&quot; willultimately benefit all our important constituents has yet tobe fully appreciated by all. But it was precisely because ofour belief in the overall benefits of &quot;shareholderpartnering&quot; that we took this approach to our business and toour compensation plans.   ---   Mr. Anders is chairman and CEO of General Dynamics.</TEXT></DOC>
