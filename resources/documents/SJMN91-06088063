His 10-year-old brother, Sitha, wasthe only boy to reach shore safely.;    The second body was found about 11:30a.m. today, about half a mile from where they entered the water. The grimsearch for the missing brothers continued today as their distraught mother,Siheang Lim, 31, watched from the river bank along with hundreds of othermembers of this town's Asian community.;    Some of the boys reportedly liveby the river and had walked to what was a favorite play spot for them, oneinvestigator said today.;    &quot;I see kids riding bikes down in this area allthe time,&quot; said local resident Diana Husted. &quot;Whenever you have a river, youhave kids nearby. What kids can stay away from the water?&quot;;    But swollen byrecent rains, the river was a treacherous place Wednesday.;    Reports wereconfusing as to how the youths entered the river.;    &quot;They either pushed eachother in or were swept away when one got caught up in the current,&quot; said Sgt.Michael Ries.;    Deputy Police Chief Ed Chavez was told that &quot;one boy losthis footing and pulled the others into the water.&quot;;    Chavez said the bodyfound today was spotted in the middle of the river near the University of thePacific campus.;    &quot;We were very much surprised,&quot; he said. &quot;That's quite adistance from where they went in.&quot;;    As news of the tragedy spread Wednesdaynight, a crowd quickly gathered along the shore as emergency teams searched.Lim clenched her hands together in anguish as she waited and talked withpolice.;    Officials identified her three children as Charles, a firstgrader; Danalee, a third grader; and Herbert, a fourth grader. They said thechildren's last name was Pich.;    &quot;There have been isolated drownings here,but never anything like this,&quot; Stockton Police Lt. Wayne Hose said.;    Thefive children, whose families are friends, entered the swiftly moving watersof the Calaveras River where it cuts through the heavily residential center ofthe city, Hose said.;    A witness interviewed Wednesday night on KTVU-TV (Ch.2) spoke of seeing the children bobbing up and down and yelling for help.;   A U.S. Coast Guard helicopter was in the air at dawn, and Coast Guard and SanJoaquin County search boats and divers also resumed the grim hunt at firstlight. But by mid-day, dogs had replaced the boats, as the water beingsearched was no more than a few feet deep.;    For the large Cambodianpopulation in Stockton, the new calamity added to their grief. On Jan. 17,1989, five children -- four of them Cambodian -- died, and 30 others wereinjured during a mass shooting at Cleveland Elementary School. The gunman,Patrick Purdy, then killed himself.;    As was done in the wake of theschoolyard massacre, counseling was being provided today for classmates.;   N.Z. Carol, spokeswoman for the Stockton Unified School District, said thatschool psychologists were going room-to-room talking with all students at theelementary schools attended by the victims.;    &quot;The major difference betweenthis and what happened at Cleveland is the element of shock and fear with therandomness of what happened at Cleveland elementary,&quot; she said.;    &quot;This wassad, a tragedy, but it also was an accident. That makes a very big differenceabout vulnerability. If something is random, it's something you feel you can'tcontrol, but with an accident, a parent can talk to the children and cautionthem&quot; about potential perils, she said.;    Wednesday's incident was thesecond since storms swept through Northern California this month.;    On March4, 6-year-old Amanda Shelton was swept into swollen Concow Creek in ButteCounty, north of Sacramento.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CATHIE CALVERT, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Stockton  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910328  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  749  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday March 28, 199100088063,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENGFRONT  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
