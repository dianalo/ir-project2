Pressure on the Mafia has cut its share of the American heroinmarket from one-third down to barely 10 percent, U.S. officialssay, but sales have been channeled instead to Western Europe.   Mafia wholesalers are pushing cocaine into new European markets.They exchange heroin directly for Colombian cocaine, eliminatingthe cash transfers that make them vulnerable.   A defector has implicated two recent cabinet ministers, echoingothers' statements that senior political figures protect the Mafia,but police say they have no proof to move against politicians.   ``Trials alone are not enough,'' said Giusto Sciacchitano, asenior prosecutor, interviewed in the concrete bunker where a teamof magistrates piece together evidence for continuing``maxi-trials.''   Under new laws, Italian authorities have seized $200 million insuspect earnings since 1982. In December, 338 Mafiosi were given2,665 years of sentences after the first maxi-trial.   In April, a joint U.S.-Italian operation disrupted the PizzaConnection, which markets Mafia heroin in America. Police arrestedEmanuele Adamita, a fugitive Sicilian drug lord, and 101 others.   But public fear, official corruption, lack of evidence, foreignrefuges and Italy's legal system were all obstacles, Sciacchitanosaid. ``The Mafia is very hard to beat. Very hard.''   After the maxi-trial verdicts were delivered, hit men on amotorscooter murdered Giuseppe Insalaco, a former Palermo mayor whofought corruption, as he sat at the wheel of his car in rush-hourtraffic.   In Italy, prosecutors cannot plea bargain, nor can policeinfiltrate. The law requires that all crimes be punished, even whencommitted by undercover officers or state's witnesses as part of aninvestigation.   Italy is ill-equipped to protect informers and their familiesfrom Mafia vengeance. Tommaso Buscetta, the Mafia boss-informerbehind the first maxi-trials, took refuge in the United States.   Buscetta helped convict Vito Ciancimino, ex-mayor of Palermo,but Sciacchitano said politicians were difficult to put on trial. Aparliamentary committee linked Ciancimino to the Mafia in 1976.   ``The Mafia has always been at the edges of power,'' saidAttilio Bolzoni, a journalist who was arrested recently afterreporting on an informer's confession that named two ministers. Hewas held six days, then released.   U.S. authorities say privately that although Italy has scoredimportant victories, little will change if public officials closeto the Mafia were not rooted out.   Apart from outright graft, diplomats say, some politicians courtthe vital Sicilian vote by going easy on the issue.   Italian authorities are divided on how far the Mafia reachesinto the state. Giuseppe Grassi, director of the Anti-CrimeDepartment of Italy's national police force, said:   ``We have no evidence. Of course, there is some officialcorruption. That is normal. But politicians belonging to the Mafia,I don't think so.''   Grassi contends that with uncounted billions of dollars in drugrevenue, with sanctuaries provided by Latin American governments,the Mafia no longer needs political protection.   Authorities have arrested 4,100 suspected Mafiosi since 1982, hesaid. ``But they can replace them overnight in Sicily, with all itsunemployment and poverty,'' he added.   For many Sicilians, going after the Mafia is tantamount totrying to suppress the weather.   ``Hah,'' snorted an entrepreneur named Napoli when asked if theMafia had been weakened. He drove his questioner by the leafypiazza where Joe Petrosino, a New York detective, was murdered in1902.   Petrosino, who was investigating the Mafia, was shot with asawed-off shotgun known as a lupara. Modern versions, submachineguns, more recently killed an average of one person a day inPalermo.   Italian and U.S. authorities agreed that Mafia families had madea strategic retreat to regroup, not only reorganizing their drugoperations but also concentrating more on extortion and ransom.   Such venerable dons as Michele Greco and Luciano Liggio,convicted in the maxi-trial, live lavishly in prison, with servantsbringing them champagne meals from Palermo's finest restaurants.   ``These guys can run a drug operation from inside prison just aswell as they can outside,'' a U.S. drug enforcement officerobserved.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
