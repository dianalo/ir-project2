And then tiny Lithuania,a Baltic state forcibly absorbed after the 1939 Nazi-Sovietpact, declared its independence.   The Soviet Union, after acquiescing in the dismembermentof its Eastern European empire, now wants to slow down thetrain of change. With the prospect of a Soviet blockadethreatening Lithuania's survival, President Bush has anunenviable choice: support for the Lithuanian peopleasserting a cherished American right of self-determination,or support for Soviet President Gorbachev and the agenda ofhistoric changes he seems willing to negotiate with the WhiteHouse.</LP><TEXT>   This agonizing dilemma turned more acute yesterday, whenLithuanian officials reported that the Soviets have followedthrough on their threats to shut off the supply of oil to theBaltic republic. The Soviets also have threatened to cut offnatural gas supplies. Last night, the administration wasscrambling to verify the report of the oil cutoff, but anofficial cautioned that even if it is confirmed, the U.S.won't necessarily retaliate immediately. He said the Sovietscould reverse themselves.   Lithuania has created deep tension between what Mr. Bushwants to do and what events might force him to do: Imposesanctions against the Kremlin for economically strangling theLithuanians. More than that, the issue pits some of theRepublican Party's most vocal conservatives against Mr. Bushand his moderate supporters, whose first priority is tosupport Mr. Gorbachev.   To a surprising degree, the American people seemoverwhelmingly on the side of Mr. Gorbachev and the Bushadministration's efforts to avoid a fight over Lithuania.Even if the Soviet Union violently suppresses Lithuania's bidfor independence, the American public opposes canceling nextmonth's planned summit talks between George Bush and SovietPresident Mikhail Gorbachev -- by a stunning 61% to 31%,according to a new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll.   A surprisingly similar number of Americans think Mr. Bush&quot;shouldn't get involved&quot; by recognizing Lithuania. They wouldrather the U.S. stay on good terms with Moscow than supportthe republic's bid to secede.   Nonetheless, Mr. Bush appears to feel he may be forced todo something to support the Lithuanians, even at the risk ofundermining Mr. Gorbachev and the chances for historic deals.If Mr. Gorbachev presses the fuel embargo even further, theadministration has reluctantly concluded it would have tohold up new trade pacts with the Soviets that Mr. Bushballyhooed at the Malta summit. And if the Soviets go so faras to use force in the breakaway republic, the summit or thearms control talks would probably be called off.   The Lithuania crisis seems to have forced Mr. Gorbachev tothe right on arms-control issues as well. The Soviet militaryapparently has forced an end to new concessions by Moscow inthe negotiations, at least for now. And if the new hard linecan't be overcome next month, when Secretary of State JamesBaker flies to Moscow for crucial pre-summit talks, theprospect of a summit deal could vanish.   &quot;Things have suddenly gotten much tougher,&quot; says MarshallGoldman of Harvard's Russian Research Center. &quot;Until now,George Bush has had nothing but good news from Moscow. He'sbeen like an outfielder who just sticks out his glove and theball falls in. Now he has to chase those balls hard to catchthem.&quot;   For now, the administration's goal is to keep focused onthe historic changes now within reach: deep arms cuts byMoscow and plans for German unity and Eastern Europeanindependence. The administration is determined not to allowLithuania to throw the process off track. So even if theadministration feels compelled to respond to a Sovietcrackdown by imposing sanctions, it will aim to make them asminimal and cosmetic as possible.   For instance, now that the Soviets have moved to cut offfuel supplies, the U.S. probably will apply sanctions only inthe trade and economic area, leaving intact the chance ofachieving more far-reaching agreements on arms and politicalreform of the Communist bloc. The trade pacts were injeopardy anyway because the Soviet government still hasn'tpassed a law liberalizing emigration, long a key U.S.condition for trade concessions.   Meanwhile, administration officials are campaigning onCapitol Hill and with reporters to convince people that thearms-control deals are advantageous to the U.S., andshouldn't be sacrificed to Lithuania. &quot;Our policy toward theSoviet Union is shaped by what is in the interest of theUnited States of America,&quot; Secretary of State James Bakertold Congress yesterday.   Moreover, America's European allies agree with Americanpublic sentiment on Lithuania. The allies are pushing Mr.Bush to keep broader superpower ties on schedule. Just thisweek, Mr. Bush met with a few senators just back from a visitto Moscow and hinted that he is getting pressure fromAmerica's allies not to let Baltic unrest push thesuperpowers off their track.   Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker sense no public pressure for themto do more, and they avidly follow poll readings on thesubject. The new Journal/NBC News survey will only reinforcethat feeling.   &quot;How do I account for the polls that suggest that weshould somehow not get involved in the question of theBaltics?&quot; Mr. Baker asks rhetorically. &quot;I suppose that someof it is a recognition on the part of the American peoplethat we have a lot of interests at stake here that are veryimportant to the United States of America.&quot;   Washington bureaucrats have grown accustomed to havingringside seats for wrangling between officials from the WhiteHouse and the State and Defense Departments over how tohandle basic superpower relations. But in this case, they aresurprised by the lack of debate. Administration officialsfrom often-combative agencies insist there isn't anyhigh-level internal challenge to their strategy of minimizingthe Lithuania issue.   When some hawkish midlevel Pentagon aides recentlysuggested that the administration should prepare to sendmaterial assistance -- petroleum products or hard currency --to Lithuania, the idea was slapped down. Indeed, someofficials felt the president went too far by publicly sayinglast weekend that the threat of a fuel cutoff left him&quot;deeply disturbed.&quot;   Such sentiments have produced a profound ambivalencewithin the administration about the Lithuanians' pursuit ofindependence from the Soviet Union, a cause the U.S.technically supports. Nowhere was that ambivalence moreapparent than a few days ago, when Mr. Bush met privatelywith leaders of the Baltic-American community.   The Baltic-Americans, who had been clamoring for weeks fora White House meeting, were delighted when Mr. Bush flatlydeclared at the outset Lithuanian independence is inevitable.&quot;I underline the word inevitable, because that is the wordthe president used,&quot; John Genys, a representative of theLithuanian American Council, says.   But that happiness ebbed when Mr. Bush was pressed torecognize Lithuania's government. The president respondedthat he needed to move carefully and &quot;sort out theinformation&quot; from Lithuania before taking such a step.   Mr. Bush has made it apparent that he wants to pursue hiscareful policy with discipline. Two weeks ago, without anyannouncement, he sent Mr. Gorbachev a signal that he wouldn'tlet the crisis in Lithuania block warmer ties, by immediatelyagreeing to Soviet observer status in world trade talks.Earlier, Mr. Bush had insisted that such status be denieduntil 1991.   The united moderate front has dismayed hard-liners. FrankGaffney, a former Reagan administration Pentagon aide whoheads the Center for Security Policy, says, &quot;I'm firmlyconvinced that nobody who matters is pressing inside theadministration to be tougher. The folks who brought you thepuerile sanctions against China are the same people who willtry to limit the response on Lithuania.&quot;   Mr. Gaffney's group has called the potential trade talkdelays &quot;Potemkin sanctions&quot; and proposed instead a muchharsher list of economic measures, including fuel aid forLithuania and a cutoff of existing energy cooperation withMoscow. But he admits that, on a recent speaking tour aroundthe country, he found that &quot;nobody is talking about thisissue.&quot; He adds that &quot;the American people have a tradition ofxenophobia, isolation and indifference&quot; to foreign events.   The real problem for the Bush White House lies inside theSoviet Union. There, Mr. Gorbachev is assuring visitors hewants to avoid a clash over Lithuania as much as Mr. Bushdoes. But he has shown little sign that he knows how to doso.   When a group of American politicians saw Mr. Gorbachev inthe Kremlin last week, the Soviet president hinted he'sprepared over time to deal with Lithuania's quest forindependence -- but only on his terms. &quot;He indicated that ifthe Lithuanians want a divorce that they are entitled toone,&quot; says Sen. Jim Sasser (D., Tenn.). But the Soviet leaderadded that &quot;even when you get a divorce, you're required togo to court for a settlement.&quot;   Behind that reasonable-sounding mien, the Americanvisitors sensed a seething anger. Mr. Gorbachev twice toldthe senators Lithuania's independence-minded leaders have puteveryone in a &quot;stupid situation.&quot; He mocked the Lithuanians'political skills.   That irritation is privately shared in the White House andState Department, where there is a widespread belief thatMoscow will eventually let Lithuania secede, and that thecurrent confrontation might have been avoided by defterhandling by leaders of the Baltic republic.   Still, if Moscow enforces draconian measures againstLithuania, some sanctions will be imposed. &quot;If you seevideotapes on TV of little children freezing or starving,this administration will turn on a dime,&quot; says a seniorofficial at State.   The administration could retaliate by cutting off talks onseveral economic issues, including trade, taxes, civilaviation, investments, and maritime transport. Officials hadhoped for agreements on the issues by the May 30 summit.   The White House portrays all those negotiations asprimarily beneficial to the Soviets, at least in the shortrun. In contrast, officials say, the talks on conventionaland nuclear arms, and on Germany, promise to seal a historicretreat of Soviet power and armed force in Europe, and aresquarely in the American interest.   While the current dilemma mainly stems from Soviet actionsand attitudes, Harvard's Mr. Goldman says, &quot;We could havemade things easier if we'd moved on trade months ago.&quot;   He says such a gesture then would have given Mr. Gorbacheva concession that might have helped damp both militarypressure and secessionist sentiment. &quot;If we'd helped himthen, it might have postponed these kinds of crises,&quot; hesays. &quot;Gestures at this point are very important to MikhailGorbachev.&quot;   ---                   Gorbachev vs. Lithuania                                                                                                          &quot;If the choice were between maintaining friendly ties withPresident Gorbachev or supporting the Lithuanians' effortsfor independence, which do you feel is more important?&quot;                                                                                                          Maintain friendly ties ............. 61%   Support Lithuania .................. 23%   Not sure ........................... 16%                                                                                                          THE WALL STREET JOURNAL/NBC NEWS POLL</TEXT></DOC>
