Hachette Chairman Jean-Luc Lagardere told a meeting ofshareholders that he has contacted several potentialpartners, including Andre Rousselet, chief executive officerof successful French pay-television company Canal Plus S.A.</LP><TEXT>   The aim is clear: to share the financial burden. &quot;We'llremain the operators of La Cinq,&quot; but &quot;we can't be asked torun risks which go beyond reason,&quot; Mr. Lagardere toldshareholders, who were meeting to approve an issue of 350million French francs ($64.9 million) of subordinateddebentures for the group. The issue will be used mainly toreduce debt in the U.S. after recent magazine anddistribution acquisitions.   Mr. Lagardere's comments on La Cinq indicated that some ofHachette's current partners, including Italian media magnateSilvio Berlusconi, may have lost patience with the venture.Mr. Berlusconi holds 25% of the channel, and banking alliesled by France's Credit Lyonnais control 35%.   Berlusconi aides in Italy weren't available for comment.   Canal Plus confirmed that Mr. Rousselet has been contactedby his counterpart at Hachette, but a Canal Plus spokeswomanstressed that a deal isn't in the works.   Analysts in Paris said Canal Plus, which has been afavored growth stock on the Bourse over the past year, isn'tlikely to be interested in sullying its reputation with LaCinq. Canal Plus enjoys a war chest of about one billionfrancs despite its brisk cable expansion throughout Europe.   Mr. Lagardere conceded that Hachette will have to use 975million francs of risk provisions it set aside last year tocover La Cinq's 1991 losses. That money originally wasexpected to offset the channel's deficits through 1992. Inaddition, Hachette will have to dole out 500 million francsthrough this year to cover the station's operating costs.Hachette operates the channel, although it owns only 25% --the legal limit under French media regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
