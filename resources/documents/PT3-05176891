More specifically, it      relates to making water soluble polyaluminosilicate microgels by      aluminating microgels of polysilicic acid. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is known that amorphorus, water insoluble polyaluminosilicates can be      formed by the reaction of alkali metal polysilicates with alkali metal      aluminates. Such polyaluminosilicates or synthetic zeolites have found use      as catalysts, catalyst supports and ion exchange materials. Also, it is      known that the particles in colloidal silica sols can be surface      aluminated by aluminate ions to form a coating of polyaluminosilicate as      disclosed in the book &quot;The Chemistry of Silica&quot; by Ralph K. Iler, John      Wiley andamp; Sons, NY, 1979, pp. 407-410. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,213,950 discloses an improved process for the preparation      of amorphous, water insoluble polyaluminosilicates by the reaction of      alkali metal aluminates with aqueous polysilicic acid at pH 2-4. The      disclosure stresses the use of true solutions of polysilicic acid not      appreciably crosslinked and distinguished from colloidal solutions,      suspensions, dispersions and gels. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is concerned with the preparation of new water      soluble polyaluminosilicate microgels having unique properties and      characteristics. The new materials are formed over a wide pH range of      2-10.5 by the reaction of aqueous solutions of partially gelled      polysilicic acid and an aqueous solution of an aluminum salt, preferably      an alkali metal aluminate, followed by dilution of the reaction mix before      gelation has occurred in order to stabilize the polyaluminosilicate      microgels in an active form. Alternatively, the water soluble      polyaluminosilicate microgels may be produced by dilution of the      polysilicic acid stock before mixing with the alkali metal aluminate. The      water soluble polyaluminosilicates so produced are distinct from the      amorphous polyaluminosilicates and polyaluminosilicate coated colloidal      silicas of the prior art in that they have a very high surface area,      typically 1000 meter.sup.2 /gram (m.sup.2 /g) or greater and surprisingly      a very high surface acidity, typically 1 milliequivalent/gram (meq/g) or      greater. The alumina/silica mole ratio or content is generally greater      than about 1/100 and preferably between about 1/25 and 1/4. Their physical      structure is believed to consist essentially of aggregates of very small      particles of silica, surface aluminated, formed into chains and      crosslinked into three-dimensional networks or microgels. Some colloidal      silica and colloidal alumina particles may be present with the      polyaluminosilicate microgels. </PAR><PAR>  The polyaluminosilicates of this invention are formed by the reaction of      polysilicic acid with an aluminum salt, preferably an alkali metal      aluminate. They consist of aggregates of very small particles having a      high surface area, typically about 1000 meters.sup.2 /gram (m.sup.2 /g) or      greater and an alumina/silica mole ratio or content greater than about      1/100 and preferably between about 1/25 and 1/4. Their physical structure      is believed to form particle chains and three dimensional networks. </PAR><PAR>  The polyaluminosilicates thus formed provide improved operating benefits      over the aluminated colloidal silicas of the prior art in papermaking, for      example. Such commercial aluminated colloidal silicas used in papermaking      consist of larger, non-aggregated particles with a surface area of about      500-550 m.sup.2 /g, a surface acidity of 0.66 meq/g or less, and an      alumina/silica mole content of about 1/60. </PAR><PAR>  The water soluble polyaluminosilicates of this invention are believed to      derive their structure from the polysilicic acid stock formed initially by      an appropriate deionization or acidification of a dilute alkali metal      polysilicate, for example Na.sub.2 O.3.2SiO.sub.2. Such polysilicic acid      stock, also known as &quot;active silica&quot; consists, according to Iler in the      above cited text, pp. 174 and 301-303, of very small 1-2 nanometer (nm)      primary particles which are aggregated into chains and three dimensional      networks. Such networks or microgels, when converted to aluminosilicates      by reaction with sodium aluminate exhibit a considerably greater      efficiency in flocculating fiber and filler fines than larger      non-aggregated aluminated silica particles particularly when employed with      a cationic polymer, such as cationic starch, cationic guar or cationic      polyacrylamide. The greater efficiency in flocculation is believed to      result from both the increased effectiveness of the microgel structure in      locking together or bridging pulp and filler fines and also from the high      surface acidity more effectively completing charge neutralization reaction      with the cationic components. </PAR><PAR>  The water soluble polyaluminosilicates have a wide range of application to      different papermaking stocks including those containing bleached kraft      pulp, groundwood pulp and thermomechanical pulp. They may also be used for      the clarification of white waters and the recovery of pulp and filler      components. They function well under both acid and alkaline papermaking      conditions, that is, over a pH range of about 4-9. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 2,217,466 describes the early use of polysilicic acid or      active silica as a coagulant aid in the treatment of raw water. The      article &quot;Activated Silica, a New Chemical Engineering Tool&quot; by Merrill and      Bolton, Chem. Eng. Progress 1 (1947), 27, summarizes the development and      application of anionic active silica and mentions its use as a coagulant      for paper mill white water and as a retention aid for fiber and filler      fines when added to the head box of a paper machine. No mention is made of      the co-use of anionic active silica together with cationic polymers. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,224,927 and 3,253,978 disclose the co-use of cationic      starch together with anionic colloidal silica as a binding agent for      inorganic fibers in refractory fiber bonding applications. The quantities      of colloidal silica used are considerably larger than in papermaking      applications, that is, 10-20 weight percent (wt. %) of the product for      fiber bonding versus about 1 wt. % of the product for paper applications.      Also, in fiber binding, conditions leading to flocculation are to be      avoided whereas in papermaking, flocculation is a desired result of the      additions. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,388,150 discloses a binder composition comprising colloidal      silicic acid and cationic starch for addition to papermaking stock to      improve retention of stock components or for addition to the white water      to reduce pollution problems and to recover stock component values. </PAR><PAR>  International Patent Publication WO86/00100 extends the application of      colloidal silicas in papermaking to more acid conditions by describing the      co-use of aluminated colloidal silica with cationic starches and cationic      guars. Alumination provides stronger acid sites on the surface of the      colloidal silica. As a consequence, anionic charge is maintained well into      the acid range. The preferred compositions are those containing      non-aggregated silica particles of relatively large 5-6nm diameter, low      surface area of 500 m.sup.2 /g and an alumina/silica mole content of about      1/60. </PAR><PAR>  International Patent Publication WO86/05826 describes the co-use of the      above aluminated colloidal silica and cationic polyacrylamides in      papermaking. </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Preparation of the polyaluminosilicates of the invention require the      initial preparation of polysilicic acid microgels otherwise known as      active silica. Methods for the preparation of active silica are well      described in the book &quot;Soluble Silicates,&quot; Vol. II, by James G. Vail and      published by Reinhold Publishing Co., NY, 1960. In general, the methods      all involve the partial acidification usually to about pH 8-9 of a dilute      solution of alkali metal silicate such as sodium polysilicate Na.sub.2      O.3.2SiO.sub.2. Acidification has been achieved using mineral acids, acid      exchange resins, acid salts and acid gases. The use of some neutral salts      as activators has also been described. </PAR><PAR>  For the purpose of practicing the present invention, acid deionization of a      dilute solution of sodium polysilicate, is preferred although the other      methods of activation reported in the literature may also be used. Iler,      in the above stated text at page 288, teaches that solutions containing up      to 12 wt. % SiO.sub.2 can be used in the formation of polysilicic acid,      the higher percentages requiring rigorous, tightly controlled operating      conditions. While the full range can be used in the practice of this      invention, SiO.sub.2 concentration in the range of 0.1-6 wt. % is      preferred. Acidification using any strong acid exchange resin known in the      art, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 2,244,325 is preferred since it      effectively removes the unwanted sodium value of the sodium silicate. If      this sodium value is not removed and sulfuric acid, say, is used for the      acidification considerable quantities of sodium sulfate are generated in      the product. This sodium sulfate can be burdensome in maintaining both      pollution and corrosion control standards. </PAR><PAR>  The deionization is preferably conducted into the acid range of pH 2.5-5      although the higher pH ranges of 5-10.5 may also be employed particularly      if higher sodium ion concentration can be tolerated. In the pH 2.5-5      range, the polysilicic acid is metastable and conditions are favorable for      aggregation of the very small, high-surface-area particles into the      desired chain and three dimensional networks described earlier. </PAR><PAR>  While the pH range 5-8 may be employed and the novel water soluble      polyaluminosilicates produced, the range is best avoided other than for      the acidification of the more dilute solutions of sodium polysilicate.      Over the pH range 5-8 polysilicic acid gels rapidly frequently leaving      insufficient time for the reaction with alkali metal aluminate. </PAR><PAR>  If the partial acidified range of pH 8-10.5 is to be employed acidification      using a mineral acid such as sulfuric acid is preferred. Acidification to      pH 8-10.5 by ion-exchange leads to incomplete removal of sodium value      (i.e., inorganic salt contamination) from the system and hence the use of      this more expensive system is hardly justified. Acidification using the      mineral acid is readily and easily conducted and the co-produced inorganic      salt facilitates the formation in the alkaline range of the desirable      polysilicic acid microgels while inhibiting the undesirable growth of the      small particles into discrete larger particles. </PAR><PAR>  The surface area of the polysilicic acids so formed generally exceeds from      about 1000 m.sup.2 /g, typically ranging to 1300 m.sup.2 /g, most often      about 1100 m.sup.2 /g. All have been found to be effective for the      formation of polyaluminosilicates. </PAR><PAR>  Silica concentrations in the range of 3-6 wt. % are generally preferred for      the formation of polysilicic acid stocks since at these concentrations      factors associated with product aging are at a minimum. However, the      metastability of the polysilicic acid to storage must also be considered.      The metastability of the polysilicic acid so formed has been found to vary      with the silica concentration and method of preparation. For example, at 3      wt. % SiO.sub.2 when prepared by batch deionization the stability at      ambient temperatures is less than a day before gelation occurs. When the      polysilicic acid is formed by column-deionization, stability at ambient      temperatures of greater than one day can be achieved even at 6 wt. %      SiO.sub.2. At 1 wt. % SiO.sub.2, however, stability at ambient      temperatures is excellent as measured by only small losses in surface area      and no visible signs of increased viscosity or gelation over a period of      three to four weeks. Further, at 1 wt. % SiO.sub.2 concentration, surface      area was found to decrease only slowly. One product with an initial      surface area of 990 m.sup.2 /g (as measured by the titration method of G.      W. Sears, Anal. Chem. 28 (1956), 1981), decreased in surface area by only      15% over a period of a month. It was also still an effective starting      material for forming polyaluminosilicates. </PAR><PAR>  While aging is not essential, it has been found that generally the      suitability of polysilicic acid as a precursor for the      polyaluminosilicates improves with aging so long as the time of aging is      less than the time it takes for the polysilicic acid to gel. That is,      polyaluminosilicates prepared from 1 wt. % polysilicic acid (polysilicic      acid containing 1 wt % SiO.sub.2), for example, that has been aged for 24      hours are frequently more effective flocculation agents than      polyaluminosilicates from the same polysilicic acid when freshly prepared.      The aging period has allowed time for more particle chain and three      dimensional network formation. </PAR><PAR>  It is important to stress the need for three dimensional network or      microgel formation in the polysilicic acid stock used. While the formation      of a total gel was evidenced by highly increased viscosity and water      insolubility is to be avoided, the formation of the microgel is extremely      important. The microgel or three dimensional network formation represents      the initial stages of the gelation process before any significant increase      in viscosity has occurred. Microgel formation is a function of time,      silica concentration, pH and the presence of neutral salts, and      significant differences can be observed in the performance of polysilicic      acid formed by different modes of deionization. For example, if the      deionization of a 1 wt. % SiO.sub.2 solution, as sodium polysilicate      (Na.sub.2 O.3.2SiO.sub.2) is conducted rapidly, that is in a batch mode      with a large excess of ion-exchange resin, the polysilicic acid product is      likely to have little three dimensional network or microgel formation and      will be less effective as a stock for polyaluminosilicate formation until      it has aged. On the other hand, if the deionization is conducted slowly      with successive small additions of ion-exchange resin and pH equilibration      at each stage, the resultant polysilicic acid will require no further      aging to produce polyaluminosilicates showing excellent performance. </PAR><PAR>  In practice a preferred mode of polysilicic acid stock preparation is to      acidify the more concentrated sodium polysilicate solutions (3-6 wt. %      SiO.sub.2) to facilitate microgel formation and then to dilute to 1 wt. %      SiO.sub.2 or less to stabilize. </PAR><PAR>  After the polysilicic acid has been prepared it is mixed with the required      amount of alkali metal aluminate to form the polyaluminosilicate having an      alumina/silica content greater than about 1/100 and preferably 1/25 to      1/4. Any water soluble aluminate is suitable for this purpose. Sodium      aluminates are the most readily available commercially and are therefore      preferred. Solid sodium aluminate generally contains a slightly lower      sodium/aluminum mole ratio than liquid sodium aluminate (that is, 1.1/1      for solid versus 1.25/1 for liquid). Lower sodium in the solid aluminate      is advantageous in minimizing cost and sodium content of the      polyaluminosilicates. Offsetting this advantage is the considerable      convenience of using the commercial liquid aluminate products. </PAR><PAR>  Dilute solutions of aluminate are preferred. For example, a sodium      aluminate solution containing about 2.5 wt. % Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 prepared by      diluting VSA 45, available from Vinings Chemical Co., Atlanta, Ga., is      suitable for this purpose. </PAR><PAR>  The alkali metal aluminate must be added before the polysilicic acid gels      and preferably at a time that is less than 80% of the time it would take      the polysilicic acid to gel. </PAR><PAR>  After formation, the polyaluminosilicates are diluted to whatever      concentration the end use requires. For example, dilution preferably to      the equivalance of 2.0 wt. % SiO.sub.2 or less and more preferably to 0.5      wt. % or less is appropriate for addition to the papermaking process. As      prepared, the polyaluminosilicates retain their high flocculation      characteristics for about 24 hours. </PAR><PAR>  Because of the metastability of the polyaluminosilicates and the      polysilicic acid precursor and the prohibitive cost of shipping stable,      but very dilute, solutions containing about 1 wt. % silica, a preferred      embodiment is to produce the polyaluminosilicate at the location of      intended use. </PAR><PAR>  The polyaluminosilicate made by the process of this invention is more      reactive and efficient in the papermaking process than the commercial      aluminated colloidal silicas that are currently used. They also are      cheaper, particularly if made at the location of intended use. The user's      unit cost of silica in sodium polysilicate (Na.sub.2 O.3.2SiO.sub.2) is      about one-tenth that of silica in commercial aluminated colloidal silicas. </PAR><PAR>  In the papermaking process, cationic polymers, derived from natural and      synthetic sources have been utilized together with the      polyaluminosilicates. These cationic polymers include cationic starches,      cationic guars and cationic polyacrylamides, the application of which to      papermaking has all been described in the prior art. </PAR><PAR>  Generally, cationic starches are to be preferred since these have the      advantages of low cost and of imparting dry strength to the paper. Where      paper strength is not a primary requirement, use of the other polymers may      be advantageous. </PAR><PAR>  The cationic starch used may be derived from any of the common starch      producing materials such as corn starch, potato starch and wheat starch,      although the potato starches generally yield superior cationized products      for the practice of this invention. Cationization is effected by      commercial manufacturers using agents such as      3-chloro-2-hydroxypropyltrimethylammonium chloride to obtain cationic      starches with degrees of nitrogen substitution varying between about 0.01      and 0.1 wt. % nitrogen. Any of these cationic starches may be used in      conjunction with the polyaluminosilicates of the invention. A cationic      potato starch with a nitrogen content of about 0.03 wt. % has been most      frequently employed. In use, the polyaluminosilicates are employed in      amounts ranging from about 0.01 to 1.0 wt. % (0.2 to 20 lb./ton) of the      dry weight of the paper furnish together with cationic polymer in amounts      ranging from about 0.01 to 2.0 wt. % (0.2 to 40 lb./ton) of the dry weight      of the paper furnish. Higher amounts of either component may be employed      but usually without a beneficial technical gain and with the penalty of      increased costs. Generally preferred addition rates are about 0.05 to 0.2      wt. % (1-4 lb./ton) for the polyaluminosilicates together with 0.5 to 1.0      wt. % (10-20 lb./ton) of cationic starch and 0.025 and 0.5 wt. % (0.5 to      10 lb./ton) for the cationic guars and cationic polyacrylamides. </PAR><PAC>  Characterization of Polyaluminosilicates </PAC><PAC>  Surface Acidity </PAC><PAR>  The polyaluminosilicates of the invention have an unexpectedly high surface      acidity. This surface acidity may be up to 6 times more per gram than the      surface acidity of a corresponding aluminated commercial colloidal silica      of high surface area. </PAR><PAR>  Table A lists the surface acidity in milliequivalents per gram (meq/g) of a      series of polyaluminosilicates prepared by the reaction of calculated      amounts of sodium aluminate with a 1-day old, 1 wt. % stock solution of      polysilicic acid with a surface area of 1147 m.sup.2 /g. Also, listed in      Table A are the surface acidities of a series of samples with      corresponding degrees of surface alumination but prepared from a      commercial colloidal silica with a surface area of 550 m.sup.2 /g. Surface      acidity was determined in all cases by colloid titration using 2 wt. %      cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as titrant. End point detection was the      point of zero charge determined using an Electrokinetic Sonic Amplitude      device supplied by Matec Instruments, Inc., Hopkinton, Mass. 01748. </PAR><PAR>  Included in Table A is an &quot;R&quot; Column which represents the ratio of surface      acidity for polyaluminosilicates to that for aluminated colloidal silica.      The value of &quot;R&quot; is always greater than 2.09 which value corresponds to      the ratio of the surface areas of the stock polysilicic acid and colloidal      silica (1147/550andequals;2.09). This shows that the increase in surface acidity of      polyaluminosilicates is not primarily a function of increased surface area      and establishes that these compounds have a different chemical composition      than conventional aluminated colloidal silicas. </PAR><PAC>  Surface Area </PAC><PAR>  Surface area determinations on polysilicic acids were conducted using the      titrimetric method of G.

After      conversion to polyaluminosilicates it was necessary to remove interfering      aluminum by digestion of the polyaluminosilicate with a strong acid resin      before conducting the titration. Tests indicated little difference in the      surface area of polysilicic acid stocks before and after alumination. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE A                                                          ______________________________________                                         ALUMINATED COLLOIDAL SILICA                                                    AND POLYSILICIC ACID SAMPLES                                                   (Acid Site Content, milliequivs./gm)                                           Surface                   Polysilicic                                          Alumination                                                                               Colloidal Silica                                                                              Acid      &quot;R&quot;                                        ______________________________________                                          1         --             0.63      --                                          2         0.38           0.92      2.42                                        4         0.45           1.19      2.64                                        6         0.51           1.60      3.14                                        8         0.56           1.98      3.54                                       10         0.59           2.17      3.68                                       12         0.59           2.45      4.15                                       14         0.57           2.78      4.88                                       16         0.57           2.83      4.96                                       18         0.57           2.95      5.18                                       20         0.55           3.04      5.52                                       25         --             3.19      --                                         ______________________________________                                     </TBL></BSUM><DETD> <PAC>  EXAMPLES </PAC><PAR>  For the purpose of demonstrating the significant superiority of the      polyaluminosilicates of the present invention over the aluminated      colloidal silicas of the prior art, comparison tests have been made using      the retention/drainage aid system marketed in the United States under the      trade name &quot;Compozil&quot; (Procomp, Marietta, Ga.). </PAR><PAR>  &quot;Compozil&quot; is a two-component system comprising BMB--a cationic potato      starch and BMA-9--an aluminated colloidal silica. The BMA-9 product      contains non-aggregated silica particles of surface area about 500 m.sup.2      /g with an alumina to silica mole ratio of about 1/60 and a surface      acidity of about 0.66 meq/g. </PAR><PAR>  In conducting the comparisons, both Canadian Standard Freeness measurements      for drainage and Britt Dynamic Drainage Jar measurements for fines      retention have been made. For both types of measurements mixing conditions      and order of addition of the components have been maintained. Optimum      results are usually obtained if the cationic polymer is added first to the      papermaking furnish followed by the polyaluminosilicate, although the      reverse order of addition can also be followed. </PAR><PAR>  Mixing in all examples was conducted in the Britt Jar at an agitator speed      of 800 rpm. For freeness measurements the treated furnish was then      transferred to the cup of the freeness tester. The following mixing times      were followed: (1) add furnish to Britt Jar and stir for 15 seconds, (2)      add cationic polymer and stir for 15 seconds, (3) add polyaluminosilicate      and stir for 15 seconds, and (4) drain for fines retention measurement or      transfer to freeness tester for freeness measurement. </PAR><PAC>  Preparation of Polyaluminosilicates </PAC><PAR>  Method A sodium polysilicate (Na.sub.2 O.3.2SO.sub.2) was diluted with      water to provide 500 grams of a solution containing 1 wt. % SiO.sub.2. To      this was added slowly, in stages about 100 grams of Dowex.RTM.      50W-X8(H.sup.andplus;), a strong sulfonic acid ion exchange resin in the acid      form. The mixture was well stirred and the pH followed until it had      reached a pH of about 3. The resin was removed from the polysilicic acid      by filtration. With no aging period of the polysilicic acid solution,      sufficient dilute sodium aluminate solution containing 2.5 wt. % Al.sub.2      O.sub.3 was added to form the polyaluminosilicate of the desired Al.sub.2      O.sub.3 /SiO.sub.2 ratio. The polyaluminosilicate was diluted to 0.5 wt. %      SiO.sub.2 or less for use in the following examples. </PAR><PAC>  Method B </PAC><PAR>  Commercial sodium polysilicate (Na.sub.2 O.3.2SiO.sub.2) was diluted with      water to provide 300 g of a solution containing 4 wt. % SiO.sub.2. To this      solution was added with good agitation, 19.0 ml of 1.98M sulfuric acid      over a period of about 1 minute. Following the acidification, portions of      the polysilicic acid were sampled over the next four hours and diluted to      200 g to give dilute solutions containing 0.125 wt. % SiO.sub.2. These      dilute solutions were converted to highly efficient polyaluminosilicate by      the addition of 2.5 g of 1.25 wt. % Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 solution (as sodium      aluminate). The stock polysilicic acid gelled overnight (18 hours). </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Comparisons </PAC><PAR>  In this example measurements were made of the drainage performance of      various polyaluminosilicate compositions of the invention when used in      combination with a commercial sample of &quot;Compozil&quot; cationic starch      component BMB, S-190. All tests were made at a constant starch loading of      20 lb./ton. Comparison tests were also made using a commercial sample of      &quot;Compozil&quot; aluminated silica component BMA-9. All polyaluminosilicates      used were freshly prepared. That is, just prior to the tests, fresh      polysilicic acid containing 1 wt. % SiO.sub.2 prepared by acid      deionization of sodium polysilicate, Na.sub.2 O.3.2SiO.sub.2) was mixed      with the desired amount of dilute sodium aluminate (2.5 wt. % Al.sub.2      O.sub.3) and the mixture was then diluted to 0.5 wt. % or less. </PAR><PAR>  The furnish used was a fine paper furnish containing 70% bleached kraft      pulp (70% hardwood, 30% softwood), 29% Kaolin clay and 1% calcium      carbonate. To this, 0.66 g/l of anhydrous sodium sulfate was added as      electrolyte and the pH was adjusted to 4.5 by the addition of sulfuric      acid. The furnish was made up at 0.5 wt. % consistency but diluted to 0.3      wt. % consistency for freeness measurements. </PAR><PAR>  The results are given in Table 1, from which it may be seen that the      polyaluminosilicates of the invention out-performed the commercial sample      of aluminated colloidal silica (BMA-9). The more preferred      polyaluminosilicates, namely those with Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 /SiO.sub.2 mole      ratios of 13/87 and 17/83 gave significantly higher drainage values even      when using considerably less material. For instance, BMA-9 at a typical      commercial loading of 4 lb./t gave a freeness of 385 ml whereas the 13/87      polyaluminosilicate gave an essentially equivalent freeness of 395 ml at a      loading of only 1 lb./t--a fourfold reduction in material use. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Comparisons </PAC><PAR>  In this example measurements were made of the drainage performance of the      13/87 polyaluminosilicate when used in conjunction with various cationic      starches. The polyaluminosilicate loading was held constant at 3 lb./t and      the starch loading varied between 0 and 40 lb./t. A comparison was also      made with the BMA-9/BMB combination of the commercial Compozil system      under the same variables. The furnish used was of the same composition to      that used in Example 1 and the pH was again 4.5. The starches used were: </PAR><PA0>  BMB S-190--a cationic potato starch imported from Europe for &quot;Compozil&quot;, </PA0><PA0>  Stalok.RTM. 400--a cationic potato starch manufactured in the U.S. by A. F.      Staley Co., Decatur, Ill., and </PA0><PA0>  Stalok.RTM. 324--a cationic waxy corn starch manufactured in the U.S. by A.      F. Staley Co., Decatur, Ill. </PA0><PAR>  The results in Table 2 show that the 13/87 polyaluminosilicate of the      invention when used in combination with either of the cationic potato      starches (BMB S-190 or </PAR><PA0>  Stalok.RTM. 400) clearly out-performed the commercial BMA-9/BMB system.      Larger drainage values were obtained at lower starch loadings - an economy      in papermaking operations where dry strength is not a primary requirement.      The performance of the cationic waxy corn starch (Stalok.RTM. 324) was      inferior as has been found to be the case generally with the lower      molecular weight starches. </PA0><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Comparisons </PAC><PAR>  In this example, drainage measurements have been made for the 13/87      polyaluminosilicate in an alkaline furnish at pH 8. The furnish was a      similar composition to that used in Example 1 except that precipitated      calcium carbonate replaced the clay as inorganic filler. All tests were      made at a constant cationic starch loading of 20 lb./t. The starch used      was BMB S-190. Comparison measurements were also made using aluminated      colloidal silica of the prior art (BMA-9), simple polysilicic acid      (non-aluminated) and also sodium aluminate alone. The results are given in      Table 3 and again show that the 13/87 polysilicoaluminate gives      significantly improved freeness at lower loadings compared to the prior      art sol. It may also be seen that the polysilicic acid alone and sodium      aluminate alone (but both used in conjunction with 20 lb./t cationic      starch) have no effect in improving freeness. It is their reaction      product, the polyaluminosilicate of the invention, that effects      improvements. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 4 </PAC><PAC>  Fines Retention </PAC><PAR>  In this example, measurements of fines retention were made using a Britt      Dynamic Drainage Jar. The furnish used was an alkaline furnish at pH 8 of      the same composition to that used in Example 3. The polysilicoaluminate      used was that containing the 13/87 mole ratio of Al.sub.2 O.sub.3      /SiO.sub.2 and comparison was again made to BMA-9 aluminated colloidal      silica. Sol loading was held constant in each case at 6 lb./t and the      starch loading varied between 4 and 20 lb./t. Results are in Table 4. </PAR><PAR>  Using the polyaluminosilicate of the invention very significant      improvements in fines retention were obtained at all starch loadings,      particularly in the common commercial range of 12-20 lb./t. Compared to      the prior art system, economies in paper manufacture could be obtained by      the need to use less starch to maintain the same level of fines retention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 5 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Test Using Stoneground Wood </PAC><PAR>  In order to demonstrate the wide applicability of the polyaluminosilicates      to papermaking pulp systems freeness measurements were made on a 0.3 wt. %      furnish comprising 100% stoneground wood (aspen) under very acid      conditions, pH 4.0. Stoneground wood represents the coarse end of pulp      systems, whereas bleached kraft pulp represents the fine end. Stoneground      wood is characterized by poor drainage (freeness) and high fines content.      The results recorded in Table 5 show how increasing the amounts of 13/87      polyaluminosilicate used in conjunction with 20 lb./t cationic starch (BMB      S-190) increased the freeness of the pulp system. Turbidity measurements      for the white water from the freeness tests are also recorded. Decreasing      turbidity is an indication of improved fines retention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 6 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Test </PAC><PAR>  In this example, a comparison was made of the drainage of      polyaluminosilicate/cationic guar combinations versus aluminated colloidal      silica/cationic guar combinations of the prior art. The      polyaluminosilicate was a freshly prepared 13/87, Al.sub.2 O.sub.3      /SiO.sub.2 mole ratio product, the aluminated silica sol was a commercial      BMA-9 sample and the cationic guar was Jaguar.RTM. C-13 (Stein, Hall andamp;      Co., NY, N.Y.). Comparisons were made using both a clay-filled furnish      similar to that of Example 1 at pH 4.5 and a calcium carbonate filled      furnish similar to that of Example 3 at pH 8.0. Results are given in Table      6. All tests were made at a constant guar addition of 4 lb./t (0.2 wt. %).      The superiority of the polyaluminosilicate/cationic guar combinations over      the prior art aluminated silica sol/cationic guar combinations is clearly      demonstrated. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 7 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Tests </PAC><PAR>  In this example a comparison is made of the drainage benefits of a      polyaluminosilicate/cationic polyacrylamide combination over an aluminated      silica sol/cationic polyacrylamide combination of the prior art. The      polyaluminosilicate was a freshly prepared 13/87 mole product, the      aluminated colloidal silica was a commercial sample of BMA-9 and the      cationic polyacrylamide was a sample of Hyperfloc.RTM. 605 (Hychem Inc.,      Tampa, Fla.) with a mol wt. of about 10 million (MM) and with a cationic      content of 20-30 wt. %. Table 7 lists the results obtained in a calcium      carbonate filled furnish at pH 8 similar to Example 3 and shows improved      drainage performance of the polysilicate/cationic polyacrylamide      combination over the prior art. All tests were made at 2 lb./t (0.1 wt. %)      of cationic polyacrylamide. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 8 </PAC><PAC>  Drainage Tests </PAC><PAR>  This example demonstrates the use of polyaluminosilicates formed from a      polysilicic acid stock prepared by the partial acidification of sodium      polysilicate as described in Method B, above. The effect of aging of the      polysilicic acid stock on performance is illustrated. </PAR><PAR>  After the acidification step of Method B, the resultant solution of      polysilicic acid containing 3.75 wt. % silica was allowed to stand. During      the next 4 hours the polysilicic acid was sampled at intervals and the      sample portion diluted to contain 0.125 wt. % silica. This was then      aluminated by reaction with an aqueous solution of sodium aluminate      containing 1.25 wt. % alumina to provide polyaluminosilicates with an      alumina/silica mole ratio of 1/14. Based on a surface area of 1163 m.sup.2      /g this degree of alumination corresponded to a surface coverage of about      16%. </PAR><PAR>  For the drainage tests, an alkaline fine paper furnish similar to that used      in Example 3 was used. All tests were conducted at loadings of 20 pounds      per ton (lb./t) BMB-S190 cationic starch and 4 lb./t polyaluminosilicate.      The results are give in Table 8 from which it may be seen that the      polysilicic acid produced the highest performing polyaluminosilicate after      about 40 minutes standing. All samples clearly out-performed the sample of      commercial aluminated colloidal silica (BMA-9). </PAR><PAR>  A determination of the surface acidity of a polyaluminosilicate formed      after about 3 hours aging of the polysilicic acid stock showed a surface      acidity of 1.84 meq/g which is significantly less than the value of 2.83      meq/g reported in Table A for 16% surface aluminated polysilicic acid.      However, sodium sulfate produced in the partial neutralization of sodium      polysilicate interferes with the surface acidity titration. A      redetermination of the surface acidity of a 16% surface aluminated      colloidal silica as included in Table A in the presence of an equivalent      amount of sodium sulfate showed that the surface acidity of this product      has fallen to 0.275 meq/g. Thus the &quot;R&quot; value of the two products in the      presence of sodium sulfate remains about the same, i.e., 6/1. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                         DRAINAGE COMPARISONS                                                           Polyaluminosilicate                                                                        Freeness, ml                                                       Al.sub.2 O.sub.3 /SiO.sub.2                                                                at Sol Loading of                                                  Mole Ratio  0 lb./t 1 lb./t  2 lb./t                                                                              4 lb./t                                                                              8 lb./t                               ______________________________________                                         2/98   (BMA-9)  330     330    345   385   420                                 4/96            330     365    374   340   --                                  7/93            330     415    435   385   380                                 9/91            330     375    425   445   425                                 13/87           330     398    460   505   465                                 17/83           330     395    475   500   --                                  ______________________________________                                     </TBL><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         DRAINAGE COMPARISONS                                                                     Freeness, ml                                                                   at Starch Loading of                                                 Starch  Sole    0            10         30                                     Used    Used    lb./t  5 lb./t                                                                              lb./t                                                                               20 lb./t                                                                             lb./t                                                                               40 lb./t                          ______________________________________                                         BMB S-190                                                                              BMA-9   310     0    340  365   345  345                               (Compozil)                                                                     BMB S-190                                                                              13/87   310    305   370  460   465  430                               Stalok 400                                                                             13/87   310    --    340  425   445  420                               Stalok 324                                                                             13/87   310    --    295  310   335  --                                ______________________________________                                          All test at 3 lb./t sol.                                                  </TBL><TBL>                TABLE 3                                                          ______________________________________                                         DRAINAGE COMPARISONS AT pH 8                                                              Freeness, ml                                                                   at Sol Loading of                                                   Sol used     0 lb./t 2 lb./t 4 lb./t                                                                              6 lb./t                                                                              8 lb./t                               ______________________________________                                         BMA-9        285     330     380   415   440                                   13/87        285     470     445   425   --                                    Polyaluminosilicate                                                            SiO.sub.2    285     295     285   --    285                                   Polysilicic Acid                                                               Al.sub.2 O.sub.3                                                                            285     275     280   --    280                                   Sodium Aluminate                                                               ______________________________________                                          All tests at 20 lb./t cationic starch.
