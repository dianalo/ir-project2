In Burlington, Vt., forklift dealer William Gonyeau says customers continue to ask for Japanese products despite recent price increases of more than 10%. &quot;They think the quality is there,&quot; he says.    In Amana, Iowa, where Raytheon Co. has invested millions of dollars to automate its Amana microwave-oven factory to stay competitive with imports, the ovens' electronic core, the magnetron, is still imported. No one makes magnetrons in the U.S.    And in Farmington, Conn., Emhart Corp. is pressing executives to scour Asia for low-cost parts. &quot;We're sourcing wheelbarrow tires in Taiwan,&quot; says Wally Werner, the director of purchasing. &quot;What's going to be the next viable tire source? It could be India. It could be China.&quot;    Imports have entered America's economic bloodstream, where they appear to thrive -- and remain stubbornly strong -- beyond the influence of economic theories holding that imports should fall as prices rise. Since the dollar peaked in the 1985 first quarter, the dollar value of U.S. imports has risen 33%, even after adjusting for higher prices, and is outstripping the surge in U.S. exports. Imported goods and services continue to consume a growing share of U.S. spending and now top 12.5%, a postwar high.    The growth of imports, which extend far beyond an American taste for foreign cars and couture, partly reflects the increasing internationalization of the U.S. economy. &quot;Our economy is more dependent both on imports and on exports than ever before. I think that's unlikely to change in the next five or 10 years,&quot; says Stephen Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.    In some cases, the U.S. lacks homegrown alternatives to imports. &quot;There are simply whole classes of products where we have imports we didn't have before or where domestic production has simply ceased,&quot; says Paul Krugman, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist. For example, all compact-disk players sold in the U.S. are imported.    When the Japanese prime minister posed for photos at the White House with President Reagan in January, an indiscreet Japanese interpreter needled Mr. Reagan about how many of the photographers were using Japanese cameras. The president could only laugh in reply. No U.S.-built 35mm cameras have been on the market for years, though Eastman Kodak Co. just began making one in Rochester, N.Y.    Both Raytheon and Litton Industries Inc. boast that they make their microwave ovens in the U.S. Yet neither can build a magnetron, which generates the microwaves that cook the food, for less than foreign makers charge. Despite the falling dollar, magnetron prices are actually falling as competition between Korea and Japan heats up.    So many imported parts have become lodged in U.S. companies' supply lines that many seemingly all-American products are laced with foreign components. For example, despite some move back to domestic suppliers, half the parts in Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh computer still come from abroad.    Recent signs that the U.S. trade deficit is beginning to narrow mainly reflect faster export growth. The monthly import tallies, such as the December numbers to be released Friday, will fluctuate widely, but few economists expect a substantial, sustained fall in the physical volume of imports -- the yards of cloth or the number of personal computers -- in the next few years. And as foreigners raise prices in the U.S. to reflect their strengthening currencies, the dollar value of U.S. imports will keep rising.    In time, many economists predict, demand for imports will soften. However, &quot;it's going to be more difficult to work down the import side of the equation than is generally appreciated,&quot; warns Jerry Jasinowski, the chief economist for the National Association of Manufacturers.    Of course, a slowdown in the U.S. economy -- or at least in consumer spending -- would help reduce imports. About a fifth of all U.S. imports are consumer products, and a drop in consumer spending usually hits imports harder than domestic goods. Consumer spending is falling, with no rebound in sight.    But not only consumers are hooked on imports; so is corporate America. Imports of capital goods, which account for another fifth of all U.S. imports, are up nearly 40% since 1985. Last year, more than half the machine tools purchased in the U.S. were foreign-made despite a flurry of price increases.    Richard Van Soosten, the president of Thomasville Plastics Corp. in Georgia, knows one reason. Last year, he set out to buy American plastic-injection molding machines -- partly on patriotic grounds, partly for fear that the falling dollar might push up spare-parts prices. But he ended up with $1.1 million of Japanese machinery for his new factory, which makes cases for compact disks. He says Cincinnati Milacron Inc. beat Kawaguchi Ltd.'s price but couldn't arrange the 100% financing that he got from the Japanese.    Mr. Van Soosten's experience also illustrates the persistence of foreign exporters, particularly Asian ones. After building market share, foreign companies are reluctant to pull back even though the dollar has fallen 50% against many major currencies in the past three years. As Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, notes: &quot;Many foreign firms have established extensive distribution and service networks here, and American consumers have developed loyalties to foreign brands.&quot;    Many foreign manufacturers, especially the Japanese, are opening U.S. factories to protect themselves from the falling dollar and possible trade-restricting legislation. Such moves should reduce U.S. imports, but not as much as popularly believed.    Japanese manufacturers favor Japanese-built machinery and often import many of their parts. Most of the machinery in Toyota Motor Corp.'s $800 million auto plant in Georgetown, Ky., came from Japan, for example, and Toyota spokesmen say that when the first cars roll off the assembly line this spring, 40% of the total value will be imported. The United Auto Workers estimates that a traditional U.S. auto plant creates 25,000 supplier jobs but that a foreign-owned plant adds only 6,700.    As foreigners reach into U.S. markets, big American manufacturers have spread their wings, opening factories abroad and cultivating foreign suppliers. In their quest for lower costs, these multinationals do eventually respond to changes in exchange rates; some are increasing domestic purchases because of the lower dollar.    But these companies don't move quickly. &quot;There's an enormous amount of inertia,&quot; says Adrian T. Dillon, an economist at Eaton Corp. in Cleveland. &quot;Is the drop in the dollar going to be sustained? If so, can you find any alternative sources of supply? You can't just find a hack supplier. It takes a long time.&quot;    The low dollar hasn't dissuaded Emhart from pressing its manufacturing divisions, which make products ranging from golf clubs to industrial fasteners, to find lowcost overseas suppliers.    Emhart began importing door locks from Taiwan two years ago when Fred Hollfelder, now the president of the hardware group, stumbled on the product on a trip to Australia. &quot;It was equally good if not better&quot; than the U.S.-built alternative at &quot;a price that was better,&quot; he says. The Taiwan supplier is increasing prices -- the U.S. dollar has fallen against the Taiwan dollar, though not nearly as much as against the Japanese yen -- but manufacturing costs abroad are so low that the imported lock remains &quot;very competitive,&quot; Mr. Hollfelder says.    Yet for all the angst about America's inability to compete on world markets, imports are so strong partly because the American economy is huge. The U.S., for instance, makes up half the world-wide market for consumer electronics and buys some 25% to 30% of all auto parts made in the world.    With European economies growing slowly and the Third World smothered with debt, the U.S. is the most promising market for many foreign companies, particularly those in export-dependent economies such as Germany, Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea.    &quot;It's the single best, most stable market,&quot; says Jason Benderly, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. economist. &quot;They think of it as their locomotive of growth.&quot;    (See: &quot;Corrections andamp; Amplifications: Keystone Camera Products Corp.&quot; -- WSJ Feb. 11, 1988)   ---                U.S. Merchandise Imports              (In billions of 1987 dollars) Consumer Goods .......................... $86.8 Capital Goods ........................... $86.5 Auto .................................... $85.5 Industrial Supplies ..................... $65.2 Oil ..................................... $43.0 Foods and Feeds ......................... $24.5 Other ................................... $19.1 Total ................................... $410.6 billion Source: Commerce Department</TEXT></DOC>
