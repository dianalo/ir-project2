That news from the International Energy Agency suggests afairly pronounced slowdown in growth of the economies of theworld's industrialized countries and is a further indicationthat oil-consuming nations are as ready as they'll ever be toweather any oil disruptions from a short-lived war in theMiddle East.</LP><TEXT>   The IEA reported yesterday that world oil consumption fell700,000 barrels a day in the 1990 fourth quarter to 53.7million barrels a day. Most of the declines were in Europeand North America, with the U.S. leading the way.   The Paris-based agency expects petroleum demand to staysomewhat sluggish over this year. For all of 1991, it saysworld oil consumption will average 52.9 million barrels aday, down slightly from the 1990 average of 53 millionbarrels a day.   Meanwhile, the IEA said, the rapid recovery in productionby the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in thewake of Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait resulted in a surgein OPEC's production to 23.5 million barrels a day inDecember and helped push the world's total petroleum outputin the fourth quarter to 53.9 million barrels a day. That wasdown slightly from a year earlier. Still, in December, worldoil output outside the so-called Centrally Planned Economies,such as the Soviet Union, reached 54.3 million barrels a day,the highest level for eight months, due to higher OPECoutput.   The supply and demand fundamentals, however, had littlevisible influence in trading on the New York MercantileExchange, where prices settled pennies higher yesterday aftera roller-coaster $7-a-barrel swing tied closely to PersianGulf talks in Geneva.   Because of the trend of lower demand and higherproduction, global oil inventories increased by 200,000barrels a day in the fourth quarter, the IEA reported. Oilinventories usually decline in the high-demand winter period,falling as much as 1.5 million barrels a day.   The IEA, which represents most of the 24 nationscomprising the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment, or OECD, had been estimating that the 1990fourth quarter would see much less of an inventory reductionthan usual. Still, only a month ago, it was projecting aglobal &quot;stockdraw&quot; of 500,000 barrels a day rather than the&quot;stockbuild&quot; that it has now reported.   In its monthly Oil Market Report issued yesterday, theagency not only revised its indications of inventory changesfor the fourth quarter but also estimated that the totalamounts of oil stored in the OECD countries had climbed to469 million tons, or some 3.28 billion barrels.   That total, the IEA reported, is &quot;the highestbeginning-of-year stock level since 1982.&quot; It's equal to 96days of consumption in the OECD countries, or four days morethan a year ago.   Also, the IEA said producer countries including SaudiArabia, Iran and Venezuela are believed to be holding around100 million barrels of unsold oil in storage or in tankers atsea. Normal storage wouldn't usually exceed 40 million to 50million barrels. &quot;Much of the `excess' 50 million to 60million barrels is being held as crude close to consumermarkets, especially Europe,&quot; the IEA said.   The IEA suggested a &quot;considerable potential&quot; to reduce thehigh level of inventories both ashore and afloat. But itadded: &quot;If there were to be a disruption of supplies from the{Persian} Gulf, the magnitude of the disruption that could beaccommodated while maintaining forecast levels of consumptionwould be highly sensitive to the reaction of both {inventory}holders and consumers.&quot;   The IEA's governing board meets again tomorrow in Paris toreview the oil supply situation in view of the Persian Gulfcrisis and to make certain that its member nations areprepared to respond to possible shortages if a war erupts inthe Middle East.</TEXT></DOC>
