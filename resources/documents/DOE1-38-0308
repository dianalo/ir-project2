The objective was to accomplish a three-fold purpose:(1) To determine whether or not the isolated increases of floor spectrain nonlinear MDOF structures could be attributed to problems in modelingor in numerical solution procedures, which have been proved accuratefor assessing structure forces and deformations but not for floor motions,(2) To examine the influence of various factors on floor response spectratowards obtaining an ability to predict qualitatively under what conditionswe expect nonlinear-structure floor response to exceed that for the correspondinglinear-structure case, and (3) To identify under what ground motion conditionswe might expect yield-level exceedance in either structures or equipmentwhich are designed in accordance with nuclear plant regulations (thus,pinpointing cases where these nonlinear responses issues are of interest).The following sections of this paper address the outline of the parameterstudy and how its results address each of these three issues.</TEXT></DOC>
