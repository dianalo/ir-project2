The cartel of 140 companies had bid on construction of the baseat Yokosuka, the Justice Department said Tuesday.   Japan's Fair Trade Commission, which administers that country'santitrust laws, earlier had fined 69 companies 1.5 percent of thevalue of each company's contract, for a total of $2.2 million, andhad warned 70 unsuccessful bidders not to continue in thebid-rigging arrangement.   Some companies offered to negotiate a settlement as a result ofthreats of a U.S. government lawsuit in the Japanese courts andalso in the U.S. courts against 26 companies also doing business inthe United States, the department said. The settlement, whichinvolved 99 firms, was negotiated in November, the agency said.   Japanese construction companies frequently collaborate on bidsin a system called ``dango'' where the bidders decide who gets thewinning bid. The 140 companies bidding for U.S. Navy contracts atYokosuka formed an association in 1984 that called itself``Seiyukai,'' or ``Friends of the Stars,'' a reference to theAmerican flag.   The association dissolved in 1987 when the companies becameaware that they were under investigation by the Navy.   Stuart M. Gerson, assistant attorney general in charge of thecivil division of the department, said the U.S. government wouldpursue ``available remedies,'' including possible lawsuits inJapan, the United States or both countries, against constructioncompanies that did not join the settlement.   ``We are pleased to have been able to reach a just resultthrough the Japanese legal process,'' Gerson said.</TEXT></DOC>
