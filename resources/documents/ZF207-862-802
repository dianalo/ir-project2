VAX/VMS minis and Wang Laboratories Inc. VS minis.andO;Later releases will let applications be recompiled for IBM AS/400minicomputers and a variety of Unix machines, Wild said.andM;Portability is critical to organizations eyeing the PC as a potentialdatabase-development platform, agreed Byron Baker, information resourcemanager and Dataserv, a computer-maintenance firm and commercial-softwaredeveloper in Eden Prairie, Minn.andM;&quot;We've been waiting for this product to come out for a long time,&quot; Bakersaid.andP;  A PC implementation of Natural is desirable, he said, to tap the PC'slower-cost processing power for applications development and to takeadvantage of new PC computer-aided software engineering tools.andM;As part of its long-term computing strategy, Dataserv plans to replaceseveral of its IBM system/36 minicomputers with six IBM Token-Ring networksthat connect 150 PCs and the company's 370 mainframes, Baker explained.andM;While Software AG pairs Natural OS/2 with its own database, the company alsoplans to market the language as a general development tool for otherdatabases, including Oracle Corp.'s Oracle and the database component ofIBM's OS/2 Extended Edition, Wild said.andM;Natural OS/2 can operate as a single-user system or be configured to run in avariety of network environments.andM;License fees for Natural OS/2 will range from $300 to $1,000, depending onthe configuration.andM;Sotware AG can be contacted at (703) 860-5050.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
