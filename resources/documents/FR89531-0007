The registrationwas made conditional since certain data were lacking. In order to evaluatethe effects of avermectin B<T2>1</T2> on fish, mammals, and aquatic invertebrates and evaluate theeffects in or on soil, several data requirements must be fulfilled duringthe period of conditional registration. Such requirements include a fishlife-cycle study (sec. 72-5) which must be submitted to the Agency by October1991; a simulated aquatic biological field study (sec. 72-7) which is dueby October 1991; a simulated mammalian field test (sec. 71-5) which isdue by October 1991; results of the analyses of the three remaining soilcore replicates (field dissipation study_sec. 164-1) which must be submittedby July 24, 1989; and an adsorption/desorption study (sec. 163-1) whichmust be submitted by June 1990.Due to the lack of these studies, the Agency is establishing the tolerancesfor this pesticide on cottonseed with an expiration date of March 31, 1993,to cover residues expected to be present during and for 1 year after theperiod of conditional registration. The data submitted in the petition and other relevant material have beenevaluated. The toxicology data considered in support of the tolerance includesa 12-month oral toxicity study in dogs with a no-observed-effect level(NOEL) of 0.25 milligram (mg)/kilogram (kg)/day; a 24-month rat chronicfeeding/oncogenicity study with a NOEL of 1. 5 mg/kg/day with no oncogeniceffects observed at dose levels up to and including 2.0 mg/kg/day, thehighest dose tested (HDT); a 22-month mouse chronic toxicity/oncogenicitystudy with a NOEL of 4 mg/kg/day with no oncogenic effects observed atdose levels up to and including 8 mg/kg/day (HDT); and a two-generationrat reproduction study with a NOEL of 0.12 mg/kg/day. At a dose level of0.40 mg/kg/day (HDT), the toxic effects observed in this study were increasednumber of dead pups at birth, decreased viability and lactation indices,decreased pup body weights, and retinal anomalies in some offspring. AvermectinB<T2>1</T2> was negative for mutagenic effects in the Ames assay, V-79 mammaliancell assay, <T3>in vitro</T3> chromosomal aberration assay in Chinese Hamster Ovarycells, and <T3>in vivo</T3> cytogenic assay in male mice. In a rat <T3>in vitro</T3> hepatocyte mutagenicity assay, avermectin B<T2>1</T2> at doses of 0.3 and 0.6 millimoles produced an increase in singlestrand DNA breaks. However, when the assay was carried out <T3>in vivo</T3> at 10.6 mg/kg, no mutagenic effects were observed in hepatocytesof rats. No teratogenic effects were observed in rats at dose levels upto and including 1.6 mg/kg/day (HDT). No teratogenic effects were observedin a rabbit teratology study with dose levels up to and including 1.0 mg/kg/day.However, in a series of developmental toxicity studies, avermectin B<T2>1</T2> produced maternaltoxicity (lethality) and developmental toxicity(cleft palate) in CF<T2>1</T2> mice. The NOEL for maternal-toxicity was 0.05 mg/kg/day, andfor developmental toxicity was 0.2 mg/kg/day. The delta-8,9-isomer of avermectin B<T2>1</T2> is a plant photodegradate which possesses avermectin-like toxicologicalactivity. Since this isomer is not produced in animals, additional toxicologystudies were conducted on this isomer. These studies included a seriesof developmental toxicity studies on rats and mice. The delta-8,9-isomerwas negative for teratogenicity in rats at doses up to and including 1.0mg/kg/day (HDT). However, in CF<T2>1</T2> mice the delta-8,9-isomer, like avermectin B<T2>1</T2>, produced maternaltoxicity (lethality) and developmental toxicity(cleft palate). The NOEL for maternaltoxicity was 0.10 mg/kg/day and theNOEL for developmental toxicity was 0.06 mg/kg/day. The delta-8,9-isomerdid not produce adverse reproductive effects in a one-generation rat reproductionstudy at doses up to and including 0.4 mg/kg/day (HDT) and was also negativein the Ames mutagenicity assay at doses up to 3,000 andCx.18;g/plate. Because of the developmental effects seen in animal studies the Agencyused the rat reproduction study with a safety factor of 300 to assess chronicdietary exposure and establish an acceptable daily intake (ADI). The 300fold safety factor was employed to account for (1) inter- and intra-speciesdifferences (2) pup death observed in the reproductions study (3) maternaltoxicity(lethality) NOEL = 0.05 mg/kg/day, and (4) cleft palate in the mouse teratologystudy with the isomer, NOEL = 0.06 mg/kg. The ADI, based on a NOEL of 0.12mg/kg/day from a 2-generation rat reproduction study and a safety factorof 300, is 0.0004 mg/kg/body weight (bwt)/day. The theoretical maximumresidue contribution (TMRC) from this tolerance as well as pending toleranceson celery, pears, and tomatoes and temporary tolerances on citrus withsecondary residues in meat and milk in 0.000052 mg/kg/bwt/day. This isequivalent to about 13 percent of the ADI. This analysis used tolerancelevel residues and 100 percent crop treated. The two most highly exposedpopulation subgroups, nonursing infants and children aged 1 to 6, haveestimated TMRCs of 0.000151 mg/kg body weight/day (38% of the ADI) and0.000118 mg/kg body weight/day (29% of the ADI), respectively. Since aruminant metabolism study indicated no accumulation of avermectin in tissuesor milk and no measurable residues (andless; 2 ppb) occurred in cottonseedeven after treatment at exaggerated application rates no tolerances forsecondary residues in meat and milk nor processing data are required. Thusthe proposed tolerance on cotton results in an exposure of less than 0.000001mg/kg body weight/day, representing less than 0.1% of the ADI. Additionally, a dietary <T3>acute</T3> exposure analysis for this tolerance and pending tolerancesfor this chemical was conducted using the NOEL of 0.06 mg/kg/day for developmentaltoxicity in CF<T2>1</T2> mice for the delta-8,9-isomer. The Tolerance Assessment System(TAS) subgroup of interest in this analysis is women aged 13 and above,which is the TAS subgroup most closely approximating women of child-bearingage. The margins of safety for the average woman of child-bearing age wascalculated to be 1,579; none of the target population is expected to havea MOS of less than 250. Non-dietary margins of safety for these effects (maternaltoxicity and developmentaltoxicity) were also calculated for persons engaged in the application ofavermectin to cotton (mixers/loaders/applicators and harvesters) and werefound to exceed 100 in all instances.  The metabolism of the chemical in plants for this cottonseed use is adequatelyunderstood. An analytical method (gas liquid chromatography with an electroncapture detector) is available for enforcement. Prior to its publicationin the ``Pesticide <T3>Analytical Manual'', </T3>Vol. II, the enforcement methodology is beingmade available in the interim to anyone who is interested in pesticideenforcement when requested from: By mail:<ITAG tagnum="15">Public Docket and Freedom of Information Section (H-7506C), </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Field Operations Division, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office of Pesticide Programs,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Environmental Protection Agency, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Arlington, VA 22202,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(703)-557-3262.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">401 M Street SW., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Washington, DC 20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office location and telephone number:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Rm. 246, CMandplusmin;2,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">1921 Jefferson Davis Highway.</ITAG>The tolerances established by amending 40 CFR Part 180 will be adequateto cover residues in or on cottonseed. There are currently no actions pending against the registration of thisproduct. This pesticide is considered useful for the purpose for whichthe tolerances are sought. Based on the above information and data considered, the Agency concludesthat the tolerances would protect the public health. Therefore, the tolerancesare established as set forth below with an expiration date of February28, 1994. After receipt and evaluation of the data required to supportthe conditional registration of avermectin B<T2>1</T2> and its delta-8,9-isomer, the Agency will consider establishingpermanent tolerances without an expiration date for residues of the chemicaland its metabolite. Any person adversely affected by this regulation may, within 30 days afterthe date of publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, file written objections with the Hearing Clerk(address above). Such objections should be submitted in quintuplicate andspecify the provisions of the regulation deemed objectionable and the groundsfor the objections. If a hearing is requested, the objections must statethe issues for the hearing. A hearing will be granted if the objectionsare legally sufficient to justify the relief sought. The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291. Pursuant to the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L.96-354, 94 Stat. 1164 (5 U.S.C. 601-612)), the Administrator has determinedthat regulations establishing new tolerances or raising tolerance levelsor establishing exemptions from the tolerance requirements do not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.A certification statement to this effect was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of May 4, 1981 (46 FR 24950). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 180</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Agricultural commodities, Pesticidesand pests, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 22, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Douglas D.
