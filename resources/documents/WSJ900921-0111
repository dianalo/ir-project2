Greenberger and Michel McQueen   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/21/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A16</SO><CO>   MDEST</CO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)CONGRESS (CNG)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Is President Bush willing to impose a deathsentence on Americans held hostage by Saddam Hussein?   Mr. Bush insists the Iraqi dictator's threats to use U.S.citizens as shields against an American attack, or even tostarve them, won't weaken his demand that Iraq withdraw fromKuwait. He feels that a preoccupation with hostages' safetywrecked Jimmy Carter's presidency and nearly derailed RonaldReagan's. &quot;Our hearts go out to the hostages and theirfamilies. But our policy cannot change. And it will notchange,&quot; the president told Congress last week.</LP><TEXT>   So far, the president's tough stance against SaddamHussein wins public support. A Wall Street Journal/NBC Newspoll taken earlier this week found that 53% of the registeredvoters responding would favor the U.S. taking military actionagainst Iraq while there are still American hostages in Iraqand Kuwait, while 34% would oppose such action. &quot;At thisstage, the public is saying, `We're playing for keeps,'&quot; saypollsters Robert Teeter and Peter Hart, who conducted thesurvey. &quot;The idea that the hostages may get harmed isaccepted.&quot;   But if the Persian Gulf crisis drags on, public pressureagainst jeopardizing hostages' lives could mount, posing atough test of Mr. Bush's determination to break a 10-yearpattern of manipulation of the U.S. by hostage-takers.   &quot;There's a big distinction between the short-term, whenpeople are rallying around the president and the flag, andwhat happens month after month when either there's a deadlockor a very bad turn in the military situation,&quot; warns JamesMcGregor Burns, a Williams College political scientist and anauthority on the presidency.   Indeed, as Mr. Bush spoke last week, there were some faintsounds of discontent. &quot;The president's statement came acrosslike a death sentence,&quot; says Michael Saba, an Illinoisbusinessman who founded Coming Home, a group that isorganizing hostage-family members to push for the release ofAmericans trapped by Iraq's invasion, now estimated at 1,350citizens. &quot;Our people are saying that there just have to beother ways to meet the president's objectives.&quot;   Mr. Saba, who was in Baghdad when Iraq invaded Kuwait butescaped seven days later, says the 500 family members he hascontacted are upset that Mr. Bush lists freeing the hostageslast after his other goals of forcing Iraq to withdraw,restoring Kuwait's government and ensuring regional security.&quot;Does the fourth goal have a lower value than the otherthree?&quot; he asks. The group plans to focus its attention onCongress, he says.   For now, most lawmakers strongly support Mr. Bush'spolicy. The hostages &quot;are in our prayers but they cannotdominate our planning,&quot; said Sen. Sam Nunn (D., Ga.),chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as he led acongressional delegation on a visit to Saudi Arabia recently.&quot;You can't run a foreign policy on hostages,&quot; agreed GOP Sen.Jake Garn of Utah.   Senior Bush administration officials say that from thebeginning of the Gulf crisis there was little debate over howto handle the hostage issue. While everything possible wouldbe done to safeguard the hostages, says a senior official, itwas understood that if they got caught in harm's way, thatwould be a necessary consequence of dealing with thesituation created by Saddam Hussein.   Mr. Bush's views on dealing with hostage situations wereformed when he was vice president and chaired a task force oncombatting terrorism, says Marlin Fitzwater, the White Housespokesman. &quot;The hostage position is so well known andstrongly felt&quot; following the experiences in Iran and Lebanon,says Mr. Fitzwater, that &quot;it's just not a matter that's beenopen to negotiations&quot; during the current crisis.   The 1986 task force report stressed that the U.S.shouldn't make concessions to terrorists -- a mistake thatwas being made by the Reagan administration, which wastrading arms to Iran for hostages, even as the report wasbeing written. According to a member of the task force, theclassified version of the report referred more specificallyto hostage-holding. It concluded that &quot;there are so manyAmericans wandering around the world, that if you makeconcessions to win someone's release, the terrorists caneasily take another,&quot; the task force member said.   From the beginning of the Gulf crisis, the administrationplayed down the hostage aspect, referring to the Americanstrapped in Iraq and Kuwait as &quot;detainees.&quot; When asked aboutthe status of these U.S. citizens on Aug. 14, Mr. Bush said:&quot;The status is inconvenienced people who want to get out.&quot; Hewaited until Aug. 20, during a speech to the Veterans ofForeign Wars, to use the word &quot;hostage.&quot;   Despite his tough stance, however, President Bush at timesviolates his own rules about maintaining a low public profileon the hostage issue. Long before the Persian Gulf troubles,when the focus was on Lebanon, a decision had been made tonot greet freed hostages at the White House, according to anadministration official. But last April, when hostage-takersin Lebanon released Robert Polhill, Mr. Bush invited him fora visit.   And Vice President Dan Quayle said in an interview earlierthis week that &quot;not a day goes by without an inquiry aboutthe hostages. They're very much on {Mr. Bush's} mind. We'rein constant contact with the families.&quot;   Mr. Fitzwater insists that 10 years of agonizing overhostages has taught officials and the public valuable lessonsabout dealing with the problem. He said Mr. Bush isn'tgetting the kind of pressure from hostage families that hedid when, as vice president, he was the Reaganadministration's liaison to the families of U.S. hostagesheld in Lebanon. &quot;People understand the policy,&quot; Mr.Fitzwater asserts, adding that some hostage families nowrealize that negotiations for some hostages only prolongscaptivity for everybody else.   But Noel Koch, who headed the Pentagon's counter-terrorismeffort from 1981 to 1986, warns that this could be the calmbefore a storm. &quot;It's still early in the game. Until thisthing becomes protracted and the suffering sets in or peoplestart getting killed, there will be a tendency on the part ofthe families to keep quiet. But that could change abruptly.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;...But Relatives of Captives inKuwait and Iraq Despair Over U.S. Belligerence&quot; -- WSJ Sept.21, 1990)   ---   &quot;Would you favor or oppose the U.S. taking military actionagainst Iraq while there are still U.S. hostages in Iraq andKuwait?&quot;                                                                                                          FAVOR                              53%   OPPOSE                             34%   NOT SURE                           13%                                                                                                          The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</TEXT></DOC>
