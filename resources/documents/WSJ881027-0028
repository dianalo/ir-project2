Mr. Wang's sentence ranks among the stiffest ever for insider-trading offenders. Former takeover speculator Ivan F. Boesky, who settled Securities and Exchange Commission charges by paying a record $100 million, also got a three-year sentence. And Dennis B. Levine, the former investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who implicated Mr. Boesky, was sentenced to two years in prison.    The 24-year-old Mr. Wang pleaded guilty last month to charges of mail, wire and securities fraud in a scheme that allegedly rang up a total of over $19 million in illicit trading profits.    According to the government's complaint filed in September, Mr. Wang passed confidential information about at least 14 Morgan Stanley investment banking deals to Fred C. Lee, a Taiwanese businessman who was then an investor in a Morgan Stanley leveraged buy-out fund.    From about June 1987 through July 1988, Mr. Lee, using more than 30 accounts, traded in stock and options of the 14 or so companies. It was Mr. Lee who reaped the $19 million profit, according to the government. He paid Mr. Wang about $200,000, including a $50,000 cash down-payment when the young analyst, then only 22 years old, agreed to provide the information, the government said. Mr. Wang's salary was reported to have been about $30,000. Ira Sorkin, Mr. Wang's attorney, said that the net amount Mr. Wang gained in the scheme was $125,000.    U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a written statement that Mr. Wang's stiff sentence was appropriate because the crimes took place after the government's actions against Mr. Levine and Mr. Boesky were widely publicized. &quot;It should send a clear message that if you trade on inside information you run a substantial risk of going to prison,&quot; he said.    Federal District Judge Kevin T. Duffy told Mr. Wang it was &quot;too bad. You had a brilliant future and you blew it.&quot;    Some defense attorneys specializing in white-collar crime viewed the sentence as too severe, comparing Mr. Wang's relatively meager gains with the many millions reaped by Mr. Boesky.    &quot;The public's hyping of this conduct, plus their love of attacking people on Wall Street, has made insider trading into a more serious crime than it should be,&quot; said Stanley Arkin, a New York defense attorney.    Other attorneys pointed out that it could have been worse for the young Wall Street professional, who faced a maximum sentence of 15 years and a potential fine of $750,000. Judge Duffy did not fine Mr. Wang, noting that his assets were &quot;worth zero.&quot;    Messrs. Wang and Lee also face a related civil SEC suit that seeks the disgorgement of the $19 million in illegal profits plus three times that amount in penalties under the Insider Trading Act. Assistant U.S. Attorney John McEnany declined to say whether criminal charges would be filed against Mr. Lee.    In a related development late yesterday, U.S. District Judge Richard Owen denied Mr. Lee's motion to set aside the entry of default judgment in the SEC's civil case against him. Judge Owen also slapped Mr. Lee with a penalty in an amount equal to any disgorgement of illegal profit.    Mr. Lee's attorneys couldn't be reached for comment.    A default judgment is issued when a defendant fails to respond to a plaintiff's action. When Mr. Lee failed to answer the SEC's suit, the U.S. District Court in Manhattan preliminarily enjoined him from transferring or suing for his assets. At the time, Mr. Lee had nearly $12.5 million in a bank account at Standard andamp; Chartered Bank, which has offices in Hong Kong and New York.    Mr. Lee filed suit in Hong Kong for those funds, which, at the SEC's urging, Judge Owen ordered to be deposited in the U.S. court's registry. Once Standard andamp; Chartered complied with the judge's order, the Hong Kong court denied Mr. Lee's suit and Mr. Lee then turned to the U.S. court for relief.    In his decision, Judge Owen said that Mr. Lee's affidavit &quot;contains not a single denial of the evidence of insider trading.&quot; In enacting the penalty, Judge Owen wrote, the purpose was &quot;to make an insider trader not just surrender his ill-gotten gains, but face severe penalties.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
