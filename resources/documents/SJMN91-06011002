It has long had a reputation for creating scores of youngmillionaire developers who started by earning salaries as low as $18,000 inhopes of working their way up to partner so they would be given equity in thecompany's projects.;    But after its reorganization, Trammell Crow will adopta more traditional corporate and compensation structure. Senior partners andlower-level workers will now receive a salary and bonuses depending onprofitability.;    In addition, the company will reduce its organizationalsprawl by cutting its geographical operating units from 15 to six and byparing two of its five management layers, officials said.;    &quot;We arestreamlining to get down to our right size,&quot; said J. McDonald Williams, themanaging partner who will become its chief executive.;    Each of the sixregional companies will have its own chief executive who will report toWilliams in Dallas. The six regions will be the Pacific Northwest, SouthernCalifornia, the Midwest, the Southwest the Northeast and Texas.;    Many smallregional offices will be closed, a process that has been going on for months,and many of the company's thousands of workers and salespeople will bedismissed. No partners, however, are expected to lose their jobs.;    Theramifications for Bay Area employees and holdings were unclear late Thursday.Allen Meredith, regional partner for the commercial real estate arm, could notbe reached for comment. And Will Thompson, a partner of North Bay Arearesidential division said, &quot;This is news to me.&quot;;    Last June, TrammellCrow's residential arm and Haseko (California) Inc. of San Francisco brokeground on a $130 million residential project that would be Santa ClaraCounty's biggest. Called The Mark, the project's plans call for more than 600apartments, 32 townhouses and a 21-story condominium tower that would be thethird-tallest high-rise in the valley. Construction is scheduled to befinished by 1993.;    Trammell Crow's commercial arm has been sellingproperties recently. Last August, for instance, it sold four Silicon Valleyindustrial buildings and four warehouses to raise cash for the acquisition ofanother developer's portfolio in Washington and Southern California and the$40 million renovation of a San Francisco office tower. The company agreed tomanage the Silicon Valley properties for a fee, an increasingly common move bythe company and developers nationwide.;    &quot;They're just being hammered inthese tough times, like all real estate developers,&quot; said Hamid Moghadam, apartner at AMB  Investments, a San Francisco-based firm that bought severalcommercial properties outside the Bay Area last year.;    In recent years,Trammell Crow's partners have faced several large crises that have threatenedto bankrupt the company. In addition, it has been dogged the past year byrumors it would default on some of its large bank loans.;    The company,which just two years ago had about 230 partners and 5,000 employees, hasdrastically slowed its commercial and residential development and isconcentrating on property sales and the management of other companies' realestate portfolios.;    &quot;The 1986 tax act eliminated the tax desirability ofreal estate partnerships,&quot; Williams said in an interview, referring to the taxact's elimination of deductions on certain real estate losses.;    &quot;More andmore of our business has been fee business. We will move our future businesstoward using a corporate structure rather than a partnership structure.&quot;;   The company was founded in 1946 by Trammell Crow, now 76, a real estatedeveloper in Dallas, who is still a partner. He saw his company through somevery rough times in the 1970s. At one now-legendary meeting with creditors inthe mid-1970s, Crow put the keys and deeds of several troubled properties on atable and told creditors that they could either agree to his plan forrescheduling payments on millions of dollars in loans or they could leave withthe keys and the deeds. His plan was accepted.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910111  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  794  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, January 11, 199100011002,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
