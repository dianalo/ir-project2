(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Discovery's astronauts, safely inorbit Monday after a weather-delayed launch, set free a $100 millionsatellite to complete a globe-spanning network that will let futurespacefarers call Mission Control at almost any time.   The 2{-ton Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, its doubleparasol-like antennae folded, slipped clear of Discovery's cargo bayat 4:10 p.m. EST and floated into space.   ``We had a good deploy, on time,'' said Discovery missionspecialist Robert C. Springer.   At a critical moment in the deployment, an unexplained electronicsignal momentarily jammed a computer used to deploy the satellite,but then, just as mysteriously, the machine cleared up and appearednormal.   ``We didn't get any (more) of those spurious signals,'' Springersaid.   Mission control confirmed that data on the ground showed that thecomputer was functioning normally.   An hour after the deployment, TDRS's powerful first-stage rocketfired and sent the craft toward a new, higher orbit.   Kathy Sullivan, an astronaut acting as Mission Controlcommunicator with Discovery, told the crew the rocket firing was soaccurate that a ``trim burn,'' used to correct errors, was notrequired.   ``Fantastic news,'' came the reply from Discovery. ``Thanks alot.''   At 10:23 p.m. EST, a second-stage rocket fired, and within 30minutes the satellite reached its work station 22,300 miles over theAtlantic Ocean.   ``It was a good burn of normal duration,'' Mission Controlannounced.   Putting TDRS in place was the major goal of the nation's 28thspace shuttle flight. The rest of the five-day mission will bedevoted to a group of science experiments, ranging from a study ofhow bones heal in space to a test of a spacecraft radiator system.   Deployment of the satellite came 6 hours, 12 minutes afterDiscovery leaped from its seaside launch pad and raced out of viewacross a clear Florida sky in a launch that marked a successfulbeginning to NASA's plan to fly seven shuttles this year.   Discovery, its rockets firing flawlessly, charged smoothly intoorbit with five astronauts, the communications satellite and a cargoof experiments that includes four rats with clipped bones, and 32chicken eggs.   ``It's a great start to a long launch season,'' launch directorBob Sieck told a news conference at the Kennedy Space Center.   The 9:57 a.m. EST liftoff was an hour and 50 minutes later thanplanned. Early-morning fog _ so dense it obscured the launch padfrom just a short distance away _ caused some delay, but the majorproblem was winds five miles overhead. Officials feared powerfulshear forces could tear the spacecraft apart as it raced upwardfaster than the speed of sound.   To compensate for the winds, a computer aboard Discovery wasquickly reprogrammed to adjust the ship's flight angle. The stalledcountdown clock was restarted and then ticked without hesitation toliftoff.   Mission commander Michael L. Coats, a 43-year-old Navy captain,leads a crew that includes Air Force Col. John E. Blaha, 46, themission pilot; Springer, 46, a Marine colonel; Dr. James. M. Bagian,37, a physician, and Marine Col. James F. Buchli, 43.   Once in place, TDRS will become the third and final link in acommunications constellation that is vital to NASA's future spaceplans.   By using the satellite network, the space agency will be able toexchange radio messages with the shuttle and other satellites atleast 85 percent of the time they are in orbit. A small sliver overthe Indian Ocean is the only part of the shuttle orbit blocked fromcontact.   Before TDRS, NASA depended on ground stations, outposts with hugedish antennae sprinkled at points around the globe. Shuttleastronauts could speak to Mission Control only as they overflew theground stations, a link that covered only about 15 percent of eachmission. NASA will soon close six ground stations at a savings of $3million a month.   Establishing the TDRS network has been a struggle for NASA.   TDRS-1 was placed into orbit in 1983, but a rocket stage failedand the agency was forced to use small attitude control jets tomaneuver the satellite into place, a process that took many weeksand burned most of the precious control fuel.   The second TDRS was destroyed, along with seven astronauts, inthe explosion of space shuttle Challenger in 1986.   NASA considered the communications network so important that themain goal of the first mission following Challenger last Septemberwas to put a new TDRS in place. The satellite was launched smoothlyand now hangs high over the Pacific Ocean.   TDRS-1, now ailing and old, will become a spare once the thirdsatellite delivered by Discovery is in place.   Sharing the shuttle cabin with Coats and his crew are four rats,32 fertilized chicken eggs and a small garden of plants.   The rats are part of an experiment to test how injured boneswould heal in the weightlessness of orbit. Before they were loadedinto cages on Discovery, small chips of bones were clipped from eachof the rodents. When the rats are returned to Earth, the healing oftheir bones will be compared the healing experienced by similar ratson the ground.   The eggs are developing embryos at the same time as a group ofeggs left on Earth. The growth rate of the two groups of eggs willbe compared after the mission.   A similar comparative study is being conducted with two types ofplants being grown aboard Discovery.</TEXT></DOC>
