DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic Rep. Robert Garcia today became thesecond U.S. congressman to be indicted in the Wedtech corruptionscandal.   A federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Garcia, a six-termDemocrat; his wife, Jane Lee Garcia; and a San Juan, Puerto Rico,attorney, Ralph Vallone Jr. on bribe-related conspiracy charges.   The indictment was released by the office of U.S. AttorneyRudolph Giuliani. The prosecutor said today that the Wedtechinvestigation is continuing.   Garcia was the 18th person to be indicted in the past decade tobe indicted on criminal charges while serving in Congress.   Garcia, 55, a Democrat from the South Bronx, easily turned awayprimary and general election challenges to win a sixth term earlierthis month.   Through his spokesman, Bill Danvers, Garcia said he was innocentand vowed to fight the charges ``with all of my God-given strength.''   ``I am grateful that this period of trial by grand jury leaks isfinally over,'' the statement said. He said the charges stemmed from``the preposterous allegations of Mario Moreno, one of the mostnotorious felons of the 20th century.''   Moreno was one of four Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty tobribing government authorities and cooperated with prosecutors. Hehad testified that Garcia and his wife had received money andjewelry as bribes for their work on behalf of the now bankruptdefense contractor.   Garcia, who was born in New York, was the second person of PuertoRican descent to be elected to Congress. Former Rep. Herman Badillo,also of New York, was the first.   On Friday, former U.S. Rep. Mario Biaggi, another Bronx Democrat,was sentenced to eight years in prison for his part in the Wedtechscandal.   He and several others were convicted in August of turningWedtech, a now-defunct defense contractor, into a cash cow thatproduced millions of dollars in bribes and kickbacks.   Wedtech was a tiny South Bronx machine shop that grew into amultimillion-dollar-a-year defense contractor through a SmallBusiness Administration program that allowed minority-owned firms toobtain government contracts without competitive bidding.   But allegations of bribery, influence-peddling and otherwrongdoing, enmeshed Wedtech in a series of federal and stateinvestigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings inDecember 1986.   To date, at least 19 people caught up in the Wedtech scandal havebeen convicted of crimes ranging from racketeering to illegallobbying.   They include former White House aide Lyn Nofziger, who wasconvicted of illegal lobbying, and two former Maryland statesenators, convicted of taking $50,000 in bribes from Wedtech.   Two one-time associates of former U.S. Attorney General EdwinMeese III have also been indicted on Wedtech-related racketeeringcharges and are scheduled to go on trial early next year. Meese wasnever indicted, although a special prosecutor questioned the formerattorney general's ethics after a lengthy investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
