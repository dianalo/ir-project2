SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Atlantic Richfield Co. said Wednesday itwould sell its Arco Solar subsidiary, which the oil giant had spent12 years and $200 million building into the largest such operationin the world.   The sale to West Germany's Siemens AG, which has teamed up withArco in a joint solar venture since 1987, was expected to becompleted this fall, Arco and Siemens said. Terms of the dealweren't announced.   Arco Solar, a pet project of former Arco Chairman RobertAnderson, had never turned a profit. But the company and solarindustry observers said the small, quickly evolving solar industrycontinues to show great promise.   They interpreted the sale as part of a back-to-basics trend inthe U.S. oil industry, and said Siemens, with itstelecommunications, power generation, electronics and otherbusinesses, can better exploit solar technology than can Arco.   ``It is a better fit in the Siemens scheme of things ... acompany that is into so many related industries,'' Arco spokesmanAlbert Greenstein said. ``Our core business is oil, gas andpetrochemicals, and we feel that Arco Solar is just not part of ourlong-term strategy for energy development.''   Siemens said the Arco operation will help the conglomeratedevelop solar energy worldwide as the technology is usedincreasingly in isolated areas without power from utilities.   The solar industry boomed by 35 percent in 1988 to about $185million in sales worldwide, said solar energy consultant BobJohnson. ``At the present time the producers of power modules can'tkeep up with demand.''   Arco Solar had about $30 million of those sales _ a big chunk ofthe solar market, but a paltry fraction of the $18.8 billiongenerated by Arco, the nation's seventh-largest oil company.   Arco Solar's devices have ranged from small battery chargers topower modules for cars, boats, rooftops and mountain communicationsrelay stations.   It also operates two solar power ``farms'' in California, a1-megawatt facility in San Bernardino County and a 6.5-megawattfacility in San Luis Obispo County. Siemens did not buy those, andArco is seeking a buyer, Greenstein said.   ``I think it's singular how long Arco has maintained interest insolar,'' said consultant Johnson, of Strategies Unlimited, aMountain View, Calif., market research firm that studies solarelectric conversions.   ``Since 1974 there have been a total of eight U.S. petroleumcompanies involved in commercial or research and development ofsolar electric. At this present time there remain just two _ Amocoand Mobil.''   Amoco's solar subsidiary is Solarex Corp., the second-largestU.S. solar company with sales Johnson estimated at $18 million lastyear. Christopher Pope, a spokesman for the Rockville, Md.,company, said he remained optimistic about the industry.   ``The technology has improved dramatically in the last fiveyears,'' Pope said. ``We've seen about a halving of our prices andmanufacturing volumes are up dramatically.''   Arco's and Solarex's main products are the panels or ``modules''that can be wired together in various ways and can be seen atopmany roofs. They also power communications relay stations atop theRockies and Andes and ice plants for Egyptian fishermen whose catchwould otherwise rot in the sun, Pope noted.   Pope said he expects the next market for solar power to be insmall power tools, appliances, outdoor lights and the like, just assolar-powered hand calculators and watches have become common.   ``The fact that Siemens is getting into it _ another blue-chipcompany _ it's an indication of the viability of the business,''Pope said.   Arco Solar, which employs about 400 people, is based inCamarillo, about 50 miles northwest of downtown Los Angeles. Arcosaid Siemens would retain Arco Solar's management and staff,continue operations in Camarillo and honor all distributormarketing agreements.   Since 1987, Arco Solar and Siemens Solar have operated PVElectric GmbH, making and selling solar products mainly to the autoindustry based on thin film silicon technology licensed from ArcoSolar. The joint venture has a factory in Munich and conductsresearch on solar technology.   Arco chairman and chief executive officer Lodwrick M. Cook said,``Every effort was made to find a buyer with the management depth,financial resources, commitment to solar energy and willingness toretain the current management, staff and facilities. Siemens metthose criteria.''</TEXT></DOC>
