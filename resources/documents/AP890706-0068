The girl's mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, had sued the heartthrobactor under a Georgia law involving the seduction of a minordaughter, and she also alleged that Lowe intentionally inflictedemotional distress on her family.   U.S. District Judge G. Ernest Tidwell, who heard arguments lastweek on Lowe's request that the lawsuit be thrown out, agreed todismiss the claim of emotional distress, saying the suit did notoffer enough facts to warrant the allegation.   But the judge refused to dismiss the claim for damages forseduction.   The lawsuit stems from a videotape Lowe purportedly made in hishotel suite while in Atlanta last summer for the Democratic NationalConvention.   The tape _ widely circulated on Atlanta's party circuit and shownelectronically censored on TV news _ apparently shows Lowe, Ms.Wilson's daughter, Jan Parsons, and another woman in sexualescapades.   In May, Ms. Wilson sued, contending Lowe enticed her daughter,then 16, into having sex with another woman while Lowe videotapedthem.   Edgar Neely III, an attorney for Lowe, had argued that thelawsuit should be dismissed because only a custodial parent may sueunder Georgia law. Neely said the girl's parents are divorced, andher father has custody.   But J. Hue Henry, Ms. Wilson's attorney, said that Miss Parsonswas living with her mother at the time and that the tape humiliatedthe family and strained Ms. Wilson's relationship with her daughter.   Lowe, 25, is the star of such films as ``St. Elmo's Fire'' and``About Last Night.''</TEXT></DOC>
