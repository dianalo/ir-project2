Since the behavior of such netscan be represented by probabilistic &quot;state&quot; graphs, stationary probabilitiesof states can be obtained by standard techniques used for analysis ofcontinuous-time homogeneous Markov chains. An immediate application ofsuch a model is performance analysis of queueing systems with exponentially(hyper- and hypo-exponentially) distributed service and interarrivaltimes, and in particular distributed computer systems. Places of Petrinets model systems queues, transitions represent servers, inhibitor arcsare used to model priorities of simultaneous events, and interrupt arcsprovide preemption of servers. Simple models of multiprocessor systemsare used as an illustration of modelling and performance evaluation.</TEXT></DOC>
