Some conservatives had hoped that the high court would usethe Michigan case as an opportunity to expand companies'ability to attack a wide range of state regulations asviolating the Constitution's protection of contractobligations. But the justices refused to use the occasion torein in regulators.                                                                                                          In a separate defeat for economic-rights advocates, theSupreme Court yesterday dismissed a case in which a developerhad claimed that its constitutional rights were violatedbecause Puerto Rico officials refused to issue it aconstruction permit for a hotel. The justices asserted in aone-sentence order that they had agreed to hear the case&quot;improvidently.&quot;   It was apparent from the oral argument of the Puerto Ricocase last month that some of the justices didn't think thedispute presented a substantial question of constitutionallaw. The federal appeals court in Boston had ruled that evenif the developer, PFZ Properties Inc., had been denied apermit arbitrarily, its claim didn't rise to the level of aviolation of the 14th Amendment guarantee of &quot;due process oflaw.&quot; (PFZ Properties Inc. vs. Rodriguez)   &quot;Notions of a major jurisprudential revolution&quot; rollingback regulation of economic rights &quot;may have been premature,&quot;conceded Clint Bolick of the Institute for Justice, aWashington group that advocates such a change in legalthinking. &quot;The court does not appear to have as strong anideological agenda as it appeared to have from the cases&quot; itagreed to consider this term, Mr. Bolick added.   The Michigan case involved a challenge by GM and Ford of a1987 amendment to a 1981 state workers' compensation law. In1981, Michigan said that employers could reduce theirworkers' compensation payments by deducting the amounts theywere paying in other employee benefits. The aim was to ensurethat injured workers wouldn't receive more in benefits thantheir salary would have been if they were still working. TheMichigan Supreme Court subsequently interpreted the 1981 lawto apply to all disability payments after March 1982, whenthe law took effect, even if the injury occurred before thelaw was passed.   Based on that interpretation, the auto companies reducedworkers' compensation payments for accidents that occurredprior to March 1982.   In 1987, the Michigan Legislature reversed course and saidthat the state court's interpretation was wrong and that the1981 law was never meant to apply to accidents that occurredbefore the law was passed. The Legislature ordered employersto refund with interest the amount that was deducted forother benefits for accidents that happened before the 1981law took effect.   The two auto makers challenged the 1987 law, saying itcould cost them a total of almost $25 million. The companiescontended the law violated a constitutional provision thatbars states from passing laws &quot;impairing the obligation ofcontracts.&quot; In a strongly worded opinion written by JusticeSandra O'Connor, the Supreme Court said it didn't have toconsider the issue of impairment because &quot;there was nocontractual agreement regarding the specific workers'compensation terms allegedly at issue.&quot;   Justice O'Connor stressed that the employment contractshad been formed before the 1981 law was enacted and that thecontracts don't mention workers' compensation benefits. Thehigh court rejected the auto makers' argument that theworkers' compensation law was an &quot;implied term&quot; of thecontracts because the parties had bargained for othercompensation with the injury benefits in mind. Such anargument, extended to apply generally, &quot;would severely limitthe ability of state legislatures to amend their regulatorylegislation,&quot; the court said.   Moreover, the justices concluded, there wasn't anyindication that the parties had contemplated limits on injurybenefits as part of their contract negotiations. (GeneralMotors Corp. vs. Romein)                                                                                                          Term Limits                                                                                                          Separately, the Supreme Court declined to hear a challengeto California's limits on the number of terms that statelegislators may serve. Although the high court's actiondoesn't indicate formal approval of the California measure,it will likely encourage other states to consider similaranti-incumbent provisions.   The justices let stand a decision by the California statesupreme court upholding a 1990 voter initiative, whichlimited the number of times state lawmakers, the governor andother officials may stand for office. Only the legislativelimits were challenged before the U.S. Supreme Court.   Fueled by resentment of Congress and politiciansgenerally, a movement for term limits for both state andfederal politicians has swept across the country. Term-limitmeasures are expected to be on the ballot in at least ninestates this November, according to U.S. Term Limits, aWashington, D.C., group. Like California, both Oklahoma andColorado passed state legislative term limits in 1990; theColorado law covers the state's congressional delegation, aswell. A provision that would have applied to members ofCongress failed in Washington state last year.   State efforts to restrict the tenure of federal lawmakersraise separate constitutional questions not addressed in thecase the Supreme Court declined to hear yesterday but likelyto produce litigation in the future.   The California measure partook of the generalanti-incumbent spirit and was promoted as a way to &quot;end thereign&quot; of influential legislative leaders, including AssemblySpeaker Willie Brown, a Democrat first elected in 1964. Theinitiative barred state senators from serving more than twofour-year terms, and assemblymen from serving more than threetwo-year terms.   Last year, members of the California Legislature and someof their supporters sued, arguing that the term limitsimpinged on incumbents' constitutional right to run foroffice and citizens' right to vote for the candidates oftheir choice. The challengers also claimed that theterm-limit initiative amounted to an unconstitutional &quot;billof attainder,&quot; a law designed to punish particular people --in this instance, veteran politicians.   The California Supreme Court rejected the challenge,concluding that the interests favoring limits outweighed anyinfringement of constitutional rights. The court said thatthe initiative doesn't &quot;affect speech interests&quot; protected bythe First Amendment and &quot;impacts all political parties on anequal basis.&quot;   In addition, the California court noted that theinitiative allows people to stay in office for a &quot;significantperiod&quot; and that at the end of their terms, incumbents mayrun for other public offices. The court said that termlimits, among other things, would encourage more competitiveelections and eliminate &quot;unfair incumbent advantages,&quot; suchas greater visibility and the use of their public staff forre-election campaigns. California lawmakers appealed thatdecision, but the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear thecase.(Legislature of California vs. Eu)                                                                                                          Commercial Speech                                                                                                          In a separate case, the justices agreed to consider theconstitutionality of a Cincinnati ordinance prohibiting thedistribution of commercial handbills on public property.   The local law effectively allows newspaper distributors tomaintain news racks on public sidewalks but denies the sameaccess to distributors of handbills advertising such thingsas real estate and educational programs. Two lower federalcourts had ruled that the ordinance violated the FirstAmendment's guarantee of free speech, which applies in manyinstances to commercial speech. The city of Cincinnatiappealed to the Supreme Court. (Cincinnati vs. DiscoveryNetwork Inc.)</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
