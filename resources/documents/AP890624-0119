(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   West Virginia Gov. Gaston Caperton sayshe will continue his efforts to end a 2{-month-old strike of thePittston Coal Group, despite the company's decision to reject hisoffer to help.   Caperton on Friday offered to mediate negotiations between UnitedMine Workers President Richard Trumka and Pittston Co. chairman PaulDouglas.   Douglas declined, saying federal mediators would be better suitedto handle negotiations. Federal mediators had been meeting with bothsides before the union dropped out of the talks on June 7.   ``I'm deeply disappointed that Pittston Coal has decided not toaccept our offer to assist in seeking a solution to the coalstrike,'' Caperton said in a statement issued late Friday.   ``But I am not ready to discontinue my efforts to end theconflict between Pittston and the Unite Mine Workers. It has toofar-reaching an effect on too many families and communities for meto give up.''   Trumka had agreed to the meeting before Douglas turned down theoffer.   Union miners went on strike at Pittston operations in Virginiaand West Virginia on April 5. Last week, the UMW also began a strikeat the company's Kentucky holdings.   At issue are wages and benefits the 1,900 striking miners contendare unfair.   Pittston is one of the relatively few mining companies that doesnot currently have a UMW contract.   Caperton's offer also was aimed at ending wildcat walkouts by44,000 miners in 10 states, at companies that do have UMW contracts.Those strikes, which the union says it has not sanctioned, havespurred sporadic incidents of violence though the situation Saturdaywas generally calm.   Many mining companies shut down for two weeks in the summer aspart of their contract with workers. One vacation period beganSaturday morning and ends July 9. Two other vacation periods are tofollow. Companies chose one of the three periods.   Vacation shutdowns mean wildcat strikers will get a break, since``there won't be anyone working at the mines to picket,'' saidDistrict 17 field representative Harold Porter.   Pittston has staggered vacations, so its mines continue running,he said.   The estimated number of miners involved in wildcat strikes,according to union and industry officials, are: West Virginia,16,000; Illinois, 8,500; Pennsylvania, 6,900; Alabama, 5,000; Ohio,2,560; Kentucky, 2,325; Indiana, 1,750; Virginia, 755; Missouri,350; and Tennessee, 200.</TEXT></DOC>
