That action enabled the last holdout (against a guilty verdictfor first-degree manslaughter) to participate more fully in thedeliberations. That person and I had had some friction, someconflict and another person's assumption of the chair enabled theholdout to participate without dealing with me.   The timing for this action was right. It could not have been doneany sooner.   I knew before the testimony was half over that there was enormouspotential for a hung jury. I could sense it in the people.   I thought there would be a hung jury. This was because of thecomplexity of the case and the circumstantial nature of the evidence.   It was clear from the beginning that the only possibility ofarriving at a verdict was to keep everyone talking, avoid for a timethe areas of greatest conflict, and try to find things we couldagree on.   We did not take a vote right away when we began deliberations. Animmediate vote would have made the jurors feel locked into aposition. I felt that we should start with as many facts that seemedto have significance that we could agree on.   There were unmistakable indications at the beginning of ourdeliberations that we were almost hopelessly divided.   There were three who indicated that it was more probable thatHedda (Nussbaum, Steinberg's live-in lover) had done it (fatallyinjured Lisa) than that Joel had done it.   But they were not putting forth their case. They never made anyeffort to convince anyone of their point of view. They thought itwas enough that they had this point of view. Essentially, theirposition was, ``I don't think Joel did it and that's it.'' Theydidn't understand how a jury works and comes to a consensus.   There were two other groups who were generally willing to arguetheir positions. There were four in the Joel-is-guilty group. Andabout five were in what basically is a middle group that wasundecided. They always felt they should try to convince the otherpeople of the positions they were holding.   The defense strategy changed several times during the trial andthat internal inconsistency weakened their case.   Only two people could have killed Lisa. If Joel knows Hedda didit, then what's all this stuff about Reye's syndrome (which thedefense at one point contended was the cause of death). I could haveeasily entertained a defense of insanity. And there was anotherjuror who was in the Joel-is-guilty camp who said she would havebeen open to an insanity defense. He left the child on the bathroomfloor when he went out to dinner. Then he comes home and usescocaine. There was some casual speculation by us about why theydidn't put on an insanity defense.   The people who believed Hedda had done it used Marilyn Walton'stestimony (who said she saw Ms. Nussbaum slap Lisa) in their ownarguments. They were taking it into account in support of their case.   Eventually, we voted unanimously a ``not guilty'' verdict on themurder count. This was a very difficult vote for several jurors whomay have done so in order to avoid a hung jury.   There were hundreds of times when tension was relieved by joking.There were only about four times when people almost came to blows.   I think that if I look deeply into my heart, I would say therewere people (jurors) I did not trust and some I did not hold ingreat respect. Over time, I came to change my opinion about some ofthe people.   In the final analysis, everything we accomplished was as a resultof the two things we had in common, a sense of humor and a greatwillingness to work together. One of the court officers said that wewere the loudest and funniest jury he had ever observed. The noise,the running jokes, and the laughter were our way of letting offsteam during and after our many long tense emotional deliberations.   There was an enormous amount of affection in that jury room _ Iwould say a form of love.   This jury was an extraordinarily diverse group of people. I thinkit's fair to say that despite all of our differences of backgroundand of opinion, we became a family _ so much so that we are planninga reunion in March.</TEXT></DOC>
