A Nimrod defeat won't harm the basic financial strength of GEC (which isn't related to General Electric Co. of the U.S.), while a victory would have added only a percentage point or two to profit. But the affair tarnishes the image of what only a few years ago was one of Britain's most admired companies. Nimrod, for which British taxpayers have already spent $1.42 billion, is the kind of sophisticated high-technology project that is increasingly critical to GEC's future. And the stormy debate, focusing national attention on the project's failings, has subjected GEC to the kind of spotlight any company dreads.    In Parliament this week, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher rejected calls for an independent, nongovernment evaluation of the two planes. And in a rebuff to GEC's chairman, James Prior -- who was standing only a few feet away in the Conservative benches -- she refused to show GEC the government's evaluations of the systems.    &quot;The opinions of those responsible for the defense of this country will not be subordinated.&quot; Mrs. Thatcher said. &quot;Defense requirements must be paramount in this decision, and they will not be subordinated to any political expediency.&quot;    Nimrod is only the latest in a string of clashes between Britain's largest heavy manufacturer and the government, GEC's largest customer. British Telecommunications PLC, only recently sold off by the government, and state-owned British Rail lately have distanced themselves from their longtime supplier. Earlier this year, the government turned down GEC's bid for Plessey Co. on antitrust grounds, rejecting GEC's argument that a merger of the two would make Britain a stronger international competitor.    A British decision to buy Awacs will also hurt GEC's chances with the French, who are expected to decide next year between the GEC and Boeing aircraft.    Critics say GEC's managing director, Lord Weinstock, the architect of the 100-year-old company's resurgence in the 1970s, is too much of a numbers man and not enough of a strategist. They say he has squirreled away profits rather than invested them for growth. And his choice of political allies hasn't helped relations with the government.    &quot;What that firm lacks is a kind of creative, exploring spirit,&quot; says Norman Strauss, a management consultant and former adviser to the prime minister. &quot;To me, it's a sleepy disaster without leadership.&quot;    A few years ago, GEC indisputably ranked among Britain's all-too-rare success stories. Lord Weinstock, 62 years old, joined GEC three decades ago when it bought his family's television business. In a few years he was in control. He began to acquire troubled manufacturers, instituting tough management and cost controls and saving much of Britain's heavy electrical industry.    GEC's structure is radically lean. A headquarters staff of about 100 in London monitors more than 100 operating companies employing 165,000 people. They make &quot;everything electrical,&quot; to quote GEC's turn-of-the-century slogan. As long as each unit reports satisfactory results, Lord Weinstock and his few lieutenants don't interfere. Officials weren't available for interviews.    GEC's efficiency yielded handsome profits, dazzling investors in years when the rest of British industry staggered. Pre-tax profit, the barometer analysts watch in Britain, surged to the equivalent of $961.1 million in the year ended March 31, 1983, converting the pound at its current rate, nearly 2 1/2 times the level six years before. By then, the company was sitting on a mountain of more than $1.86 billion in cash.    But growth has tailed off. Bill Dixon, a London-based analyst at PaineWebber Inc., expects pre-tax profit in the year ending March 31, 1987, to show the second consecutive annual decline, to $985.5 million. In the year ended March 31, GEC had pre-tax profit of $1.01 billion, or $649.8 million after taxes, on sales of $7.53 billion.    The pile of cash is still there -- $2.19 billion as of March 31 -- leading analysts and industry executives to fault GEC for failing to put such immense resources to work. Several bold gestures -- merger overtures to British Aerospace PLC and AEG AG of West Germany, a bid for Sperry Corp.'s aerospace unit and the attempt to acquire Plessey -- have failed in recent years. Lord Weinstock, ever cost-conscious, says he won't overpay just for the sake of buying something.    But the autonomy granted the company's units frustrates attempts to weave the technological strengths it already owns to move into new areas that might benefit from such combinations. Individual units often perform well; for instance, analysts praise the way GEC's Avery unit, a maker of grocery-store scales, has taken advantage of electronic technology to sell complete supermarket check-out systems. Another unit is a leading supplier world-wide of aircraft cockpit systems. But critics say the whole of GEC isn't greater than the sum of the parts.    &quot;When you look at the total, it isn't the performance of a large, vertically integrated corporation with a massive strategy,&quot; says a British electronics industry executive. &quot;What you have is the amalgamation of a lot of companies. It's almost like people -- unless you do something magic, what you come out with is average performance.&quot;    The executive adds: &quot;Weinstock is principally an accountant; he isn't interested in strategy, he isn't interested in technology, he isn't interested in leadership. All he is interested in is building a strong financial performance. The only time a manager ever hears from him is if something's gone wrong on return on assets or that month's profit.&quot;    In the case of Nimrod, it isn't clear that a stronger or more involved head office would have averted disaster. Last weekend, Mr. Prior, the GEC chairman, said the country's military experts preferred Boeing's plane to Nimrod, which needs a further $700 million of work to become operational.    To defuse concern about the lost jobs and quell British protectionism, Boeing has promised contracts to British industry over the next eight years worth 130% of the value of the Awacs contracts. But British politicians are nonetheless decrying the government's apparent inclination to buy American.    The government, under the ruling Conservative Party's push for efficiency and competition, has become a tougher customer for industry, upsetting the web of cozy relationships that long helped companies like GEC. GEC's friends in high places aren't quite as friendly as they used to be, some analysts and observers say. Lord Weinstock didn't help when a few years ago he denounced in the House of Lords the sale to the public of state-owned British Telecom, considered by Mrs. Thatcher's government to be one of its major achievements.    Mr. Prior is a Conservative member of Parliament and a former member of Mrs. Thatcher's cabinet, but he is regarded as an out-of-favor liberal. GEC's other principal Tory ally is Cecil Parkinson, a member of Parliament who resigned from the cabinet in 1983 after confirming that he had fathered his secretary's child.    The opposition Labor Party is embracing GEC's cause with zeal. Labor's bent for state ownership and huge national investment programs may suit GEC fine. GEC &quot;has first-class knowledge of the civil-service machine,&quot; says Miles Saltiel, a Prudential-Bache stock analyst and former GEC employee. He recently advised investment clients who fear Labor damage to the British economy that &quot;if you are worried about the election, GEC is a first-class hedge against a Labor victory.&quot;    ---                     GEC's Pre-Tax Profits       (Years ending March 31, in millions of dollars*)                   1978............ $  466.20                   1979............... 542.20                   1980............... 596.80                   1981............... 682.80                   1982............... 837.80                   1983............... 961.10                   1984............... 962.60                   1985............. 1,040.02                   1986............. 1,005.59                   1987**............. 985.50   *Pound converted at curent rate   **Estimated by PaineWebber Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
