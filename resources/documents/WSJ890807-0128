Spokesmen for Space Commerce Corp., a Houston company, said they have a marketing agreement with Technobribor, a group of Soviet industries that manufactured SS-20 rockets and rocket launchers.    Art Dula, president of Space Commerce, said he believes it is the first contact between a U.S. company and the Soviet military-industrial complex. He said the goal is a &quot;derivative space-launch vehicle&quot; that could be used by private companies and universities to launch scientific satellites from a mobile platform.    Under the terms of the company's agreement, the Soviet vehicles can't be sold, but could be used to launch a customer's satellite. The Soviet government would retain ownership of the rocket and launcher.    The commercial evolution of the SS-20, a missile with a 3,100 mile range, which was banned by the recent Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces treaty, will be closely watched by the U.S. Under the treaty, Russia has agreed to destroy its entire inventory of 509 SS-20 launchers and all of its SS-20 rockets.    According to State Department experts, the treaty would permit a modified version of the launcher to be used with one of the Soviet Union's rockets that carry commercial satellites into orbit.    Mr. Dula said the rocket launcher and rockets would be &quot;totally new from the ground up&quot; but would use some SS-20 parts, such as its guidance system. He said the effort is part of a larger move by Soviet officials to find commercial applications for defense plants that would otherwise have to close.    He said he expects tests on the reborn commercial version of the SS-20 to begin in 18 months. &quot;I would hope to launch a couple of tests from the U.S.,&quot; he said, adding that Space Commerce is seeking U.S clients who would be interested in launching satellites with Soviet rockets. </TEXT></DOC>
