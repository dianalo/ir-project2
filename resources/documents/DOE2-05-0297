Graphite tilesof 25x25x1.0 mm/sup 3/ were irradiated by an electron beam in an areaof 18 mm diameter. The electron beam used was of low energy and highcurrent, namely 40-50 V and 100-200 A, to simulate the near-surface depositionof energy. The beam was also defocussed to flatten the energy depositionprofile through the irradiation area of 18 mm diameter. A computer simulationtechnique using the finite-element method was conducted to analyze theexperimental results. Experimental results show that one sample whichhas some anisotropy revealed excellent resistance against high heat flux.Other graphite samples endured heat fluxed of 1-1.5 kW/cm/sup 2/, irrespectiveof variation of their properties. Experimental results suggest that theash content, the thermal expansion coefficient, and the mechanical strengthmay affect the resistance against the heat flux.</TEXT></DOC>
