(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The president of Dartmouth College onMonday accused The Review, a conservative off-campus weeklynewspaper, of ``poisoning the intellectual environment of ourcampus.''   ``What the Review has done on this campus has not been decent.What it has done has been irresponsible, mean-spirited, cruel andugly,'' President James Freedman said at a faculty meeting.   He called staff members of the independent newspaper``ideological provocateurs posing as journalists.''   Chris Whitman, editor of The Review, did not immediately returna message for comment.   The Review has been at the center of controversy since it wasfounded in 1980.   It has been attacked as anti-minority, anti-women andanti-homosexual and has been championed by such conservatives asWilliam F. Buckley Jr. and former White House communications chiefPatrick Buchanan.   Freedman's public criticism of the Review, the strongest to dateby any high-ranking Dartmouth official, came weeks after threeReview staffers were suspended and a fourth was put on probationfor their role in an angry confrontation with a black professordescribed by the Review as incompetent.   The college also announced Monday that Dean Edward Shanahan haddenied the students' request for reconsideration of their cases.   In addtion, Review staffers in 1986 were involved in a nighttimesledgehammer attack on symbolic anti-apartheid shanties on thecollege green.   Freedman, who left the University of Iowa to become president ofthe Ivy League school eight months ago, said: ``It is time for meto speak out ... because I now see that the Review is dangerouslyaffecting _ in fact, poisoning _ the intellectual environment ofour campus.''   The college, Freedman added, ``must not stand by silently when anewspaper maliciously engages in bullying tactics that seemvirtually designed to have the effect of discouraging women andmembers of minority groups from joining our faculty or enrolling asstudents.''   The college charged that The Review has referred to homosexualsas ``fairies'' and written that ``some Negroes prefer beingslaves.''   Freedman disputed claims that The Review is under attack becauseit is politically conservative, and he insisted that issues posedby the Review have ``nothing whatsoever to do with freedom ofexpression.''   He said that the Review represents ``a perversely provocativestyle of journalism that vulgarizes responsible conservativethought and is, in fact, an affront to it.''</TEXT></DOC>
