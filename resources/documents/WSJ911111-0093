Electronic bulletin boards, which can be reached bycomputer over the phone, offer a way for people with commoninterests to share ideas. But in rare cases, bulletin boardoperators offer illegal copies of popular computer programsfor sale. Callers can buy the programs for a fraction of thenormal price.   Software companies aren't sure how much they're losing tothis kind of piracy, but some aren't waiting for hardfigures. Novell employs two people who regularly log on tobulletin boards without truthfully identifying themselves.This fall, the Provo, Utah, company obtained court orders toshut down two bulletin boards, accusing their operators oftrafficking in stolen copies of Novell software.   Other firms also monitor bulletin boards. &quot;When I seesomething for sale that looks like ours, I try to download itand verify it is our copyrighted work,&quot; says Lynn Williams, aMicrosoft legal assistant. &quot;If it's our product, I tell themto please stop. We've had good results that way.&quot;   Company attorneys say they aren't violating the privacy ofbulletin board users, since these electronic forums generallywelcome all comers. Privacy advocates agree, though they sayit is less clear whether the companies are free to infiltratebulletin boards that try to exclude unwanted callers, as somedo.   Some software companies prefer to focus on other kinds ofcopycats. Spencer Layton, a senior vice president of BorlandInternational, says his company doesn't believebulletin-board piracy is enough of a problem to warrantspying. &quot;Our paranoia level isn't that high,&quot; he says.                                                                                                          Computer Viruses May   Win Military Role                                                                                                          THE Army is looking for a few good computer viruses.   Computer viruses, rogue programs that &quot;infect&quot; a networkand render machines inoperative, are most often dispatched bypranksters with a flair for programming who consider it asport to gum up a computer system. With computers playing agrowing role in battle, the Army wants to know whetherviruses can attack war-fighting hardware.   Myron Cramer, a specialist in electronic warfare at BoozAllen andamp; Hamilton, thinks the answer is yes. Not only shouldviruses -- already a staple in science fiction warfare -- beseen as weapons, he says, but the U.S. military should devisea defense against them.   The Army says it is studying the matter. One classifiedreport, completed this year by Sparta, a McLean, Va.,consulting firm, examines ways to use radio waves to injectrogue programs into enemy computer systems.   Russell Brand, a computer security specialist in PaloAlto, Calif., says radio techniques are &quot;still too primitive&quot;to insert a disabling virus into an enemy computer system.But he says computers are &quot;a logical target&quot; and viruses aplausible means to knock out enemy electronics.   The big unknown, says Mr. Brand: &quot;How to trigger a virusjust at the right time.&quot;                                                                                                          Computer Data Overload   Limits Productivity Gains                                                                                                          MAYBE more information isn't always better.   Two new economic studies provide fresh evidence that,contrary to expectations, computers don't increaseproductivity -- at least partly because the added datadelivered to workers don't lead to better decisions.   Catherine Morrison and Ernst Berndt, economists at TuftsUniversity and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology,respectively, studied the performance of 20 U.S. industriesfrom 1968 to 1986. They found computerization tended toreduce productivity growth and, as an investment, was lessefficient than other capital spending.   Gary Loveman, an economics professor at Harvard BusinessSchool, saw a similar pattern when examining the operations,from 1978 to 1984, of 70 large manufacturers based in WesternEurope and the U.S.   The studies lend credence to fears that organizationsoften incur a heavy burden when adjusting to new computerequipment. They come at a time when many corporate customersare complaining that computer makers don't pay enoughattention to the issue of worker productivity.   Mr. Loveman faults computer buyers for having too muchfaith in the value of information. Employees compound theproblem, he says, by larding pedestrian memos with factsgleaned from costly computer searches and spending hoursplaying with spreadsheet graphics or preening word-processingdocuments. &quot;We don't have a good way to make decisions abouthow much {information} is enough,&quot; he says, &quot;so people devotetoo much time to further analysis.&quot;   Computers also have a limited impact on the productivityof service companies, Mr. Berndt says, because their benefitsin service fields often are qualitative rather thanquantitative.   Moreover, computers seldom confer a competitive advantagebecause rivals &quot;end up doing the same thing,&quot; Mr. Lovemansays. &quot;So computers simply raise the ante for playing in amarket.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          BABYNAMER, a computer program to help parents name theirnewborns, is available from StudyWare. . . . Wyse Technologyis the first U.S. computer-display maker to deliver modelsthat it says meet Sweden's newest limits on radiationemissions. The displays, being marketed for thehealth-conscious in the U.S. and elsewhere, have specialpicture tubes and extra radiation shielding.</TEXT></DOC>
