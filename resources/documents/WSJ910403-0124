First Nationwide currently meets regulatory capitalrequirements, but will have to raise additional money to meetthe tougher requirements of 1994. First Nationwide has untillate June to outline its capital raising plan, &quot;including anycontributions that will be made by its parent company,&quot;according to a supervisory agreement the thrift reached lastweek with federal regulators.</LP><TEXT>   However, a First Nationwide spokesman said the savings andloan should be able to meet the tougher capital requirementswithout tapping Ford for more cash. In the fourth quarter oflast year, Ford injected $250 million in new capital to shoreup the institution.   &quot;We have a whole array of options and three years to playthem out,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;We don't see any need to goto Ford for additional capital.&quot;   Some analysts are skeptical. &quot;Clearly the need to improvetheir capital adequacy ratios is going to require an infusionof cash from the parent company.&quot; said Thomas Galvin of C.J.Lawrence Inc.   Capital levels are but one of the many issues addressed inthe 12-page supervisory agreement. Federal regulators alsowant First Nationwide to reduce its number of problem loans,tighten management controls over new lending, and providedocumentation of past transactions between subsidiaries, suchas charges for data-processing services.   Regulators plan to fine First Nationwide for failing toproperly document transactions among its subsidiaries, Forddisclosed last week in a 10-K filing with the Securities andExchange Commission.   First Nationwide's reserves did not keep pace with sharpincreases in non-performing assets in 1990, according to the10-K filing. Nonperforming assets, including nonaccrual loansand foreclosed property, rose to $839 million at year-end1990, up from $380 million a year ago.   Reserves, meanwhile, stood at $305 million, up from $177million a year ago. That means that just 36% of nonperformingassets are covered by loss provisions. That relatively lowlevel is down from 46% last year. Nonperformers represent4.1% of total assets.</TEXT></DOC>
