Dorfman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AMAT WMX HLT XCEL </CO><IN> STK </IN><TEXT>   Three insiders at Applied Materials Inc. found the escape hatch in time to miss a good part of the slide that's taken the stock down 37% since June.    The selling saved some fortunate insiders a bundle. Applied Materials shares closed at $22.50 a share yesterday. About four months ago, they were worth $35.50 apiece. The Santa Clara, Calif., company makes specialized products for the semiconductor and computer industries. Stocks related to those industries have been hard hit in the latest quarter.    Here's a chronology of some recent events:   In June, the stock peaked at $35.50. Gerald Taylor, chief financial officer, sold all of his 15,040 shares that month at $33.375 a share, realizing $500,625. That's about $163,000 more than he would have on paper if he still owned the shares. Mr. Taylor said that he &quot;wanted to diversify into something other than stock,&quot; primarily bonds, because of their lower volatility. He says he still has options to purchase a large number of company shares and has &quot;a lot of faith in the company.&quot; He views the holdings as &quot;kind of a retirement program.&quot;    In August, the company reported sharply increased earnings for its fiscal third quarter, ended July 30. A week later, John G. Stewart, a vice president, sold all of his 9,642 shares at $28.25 each. Mr. Stewart didn't return a phone call seeking comment yesterday.    In September, Tetsuo Iwasaki, a vice president who heads the company's Japanese operations, sold all of his 21,866 shares at about $27 a share. Mr. Iwasaki couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.    ---   BUZZZZZZZZ: In September, when Code Alarm Inc. got big orders from Ford and General Motors dealers for its remote-control auto security products, it was a major coup for the little company from Madison Heights, Mich.    The stock doubled in a month, sprinting from $7.125 a share at the end of August to $14.625 a share in late September. Then it gave up some of the gains, partly because of the dilutive effect of a new stock offering. Yesterday it closed at $10.125.    Some insiders have been lightening their holdings a bit during all the excitement. Marshall J. Mueller, executive vice president, sold 4% of his holding for $199,760 in August and September. Kenneth M. Mueller, a director and spokesman for the company, sold 15% of his holding for $156,020 between June and September. And Geoffrey M. Dixon, a vice president, sold 8% of his holding in September for $125,825.    Kenneth Mueller said that the company can't legally comment on the sales because of the pending stock offering.    ---   GLASS HALF FULL? Waste Management Inc. officials disagree with the statement in this column last week that there had been &quot;slightly more than the usual amount of insider selling&quot; in Waste Management shares.    James Koenig, vice president and treasurer, says that from Jan. 1 through Oct. 27, insiders increased their ownership of company shares 16%, to 7.8 million shares. Much of that increase came through exercising options.    Mr. Koenig doesn't dispute that the number of shares sold in the recent eight-week period was slightly higher than the eight-week average during the previous three years. But he said that was merely because the pool of insider-held shares is expanding; the percentage of shares sold hasn't risen. He also said that Peter Vardy, a vice president who sold 30,464 shares recently, was preparing to retire.    ---   BACK AT THE TABLE: John V. Giovenco, head of gambling operations for Hilton Hotels Corp., whose Sept. 21 purchase of 10,000 Hilton shares was discussed in this space two weeks ago, bought more shares in October.    On Oct. 19, crash anniversary day, Mr. Giovenco bought another 10,000 Hilton shares for $495,650, at an average price of $49.56 a share. That's up $4.31 a share from the price he paid a month earlier.    Back in January, Mr. Giovenco had sold his entire holding of 21,000 Hilton shares, accumulated through options exercises from 1983 to 1987. He said last month that those sales were to finance a house and tax liabilities, but he wouldn't comment on his purchases. Yesterday he couldn't be reached for comment.    ---   NEW CREW MEMBERS: Recent insider buying at Excel Bancorp in Quincy, Mass., stems from the bank's July acquisition of Lincoln Trust Co. in Hingham, Mass. Lincoln executives are expressing their faith in their new parent, says an Excel spokesman. The biggest purchase was 10,000 Excel shares bought for $107,500 by Thomas E. Curtis, Lincoln's chairman. </TEXT></DOC>
