A Congress-controlled government alone won't bringstability to India at a time when it badly needs it. Theparty hasn't even decided how to transfer the Gandhi mantleto a new leader. So while many Indians are breathing a sighof relief over the election results, they are also wonderingif the Congress is up to the challenge without a Gandhi atits helm.</LP><TEXT>   Full returns from the staggered general elections --heldin May and June and delayed by Mr. Gandhi's assassination onMay 21 -- won't be known for more than a week. But by lateMonday the Congress was outstripping its main competitors andseemed likely to govern with only the support of a smallparty or a group of defectors from other parties.   Congress's victory allays the widespread fear that Indiawould have another weak minority government. Two suchgovernments collapsed in the past seven months, bringingeconomic and political instability that was sharplyintensified by Mr. Gandhi's slaying.   By Monday night, with 362 districts declared, Congress hadwon 183 seats, the right-wing Hindu Bharatiya Janata Partywon 82 and the Janata Dal won 28. Congress lost heavily,however, in the two largest states of Uttar Pradesh andBihar, the partial results showed.   Overall, computer projections showed Congress and itssmall-party allies winning about 235 of the 511 contestedparliament seats, about 20 seats short of a majority.(Elections in several constituencies were postponed becauseof election violence; the state of Punjab goes to the pollsJune 22.)   If the projection proves accurate, Congress may be able torustle up a slim majority with the help of small groups ofunattached members of parliament, or it could go into a moresubstantial coalition with India's two Communist parties orwith the Janata Dal party of former prime minister V.P.Singh.   No one knows what will happen to Mr. Gandhi's boldcampaign platform now that he is dead. The platform laid outa timetable for major liberalizations of the Indian economy.If the Congress forms a coalition government with theCommunists or the Janata Dal, it would be forced to have &quot;acertain amount of policy flexibility,&quot; says political analystPran Chopra.   Analysts say it isn't clear whether the Congress benefitedfrom a sympathy vote after Mr. Gandhi's assassination. Evenbefore Mr. Gandhi's death, the Congress was expected to winthe largest number of votes.   A Congress-controlled government will be able to deal withshort-term problems, such as passing a long-delayed budgetand dealing with international lenders on badly needed loans.But it has to solve its own leadership problems before it canattack the country's long-term woes, which include poverty,illiteracy, a lumbering, state-controlled economy that hadbeen only partially liberalized by Mr. Gandhi from 1985 to1989, and bloody separatist movements in Punjab, Kashmir andAssam.   Congress workers want internal party elections, whichhaven't been held since 1972. The wheeler-dealers at the topwant to choose a leader from among themselves. A stalematecould saddle the party with a weak, compromise candidate. Thecurrent leader, 69-year-old P.V. Narasimha Rao, is just sucha figure and many expect him to become prime minister.   Without internal elections, there is little hope ofrevitalizing a party organization that deteriorated underformer Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and the late Mr. Gandhi.But if elections are held, two veteran members of theCongress Party could rise to the top position: Sharad Pawar,a politician in Maharashtra state, or N.D. Tiwari, a formerfinance minister with a political base in Uttar Pradeshstate. Mr. Pawar seems in a stronger position because theCongress triumphed in Maharashtra in this election.   But party elections aren't a certainty. They would end thecareers of many veteran Congress members, which is whatstopped Rajiv Gandhi from holding them, even though he vowedto.   Some analysts expect a bitter leadership struggle thatcould fracture the Congress, which has split several times inthe past, or entrench weak, compromise candidates in toppositions. That would further complicate the domesticpolitical scene.   The Hindu-chauvinist BJP seems to have failed in itsattempt to gain power in this election, although is wasestimated to have won about 23% of the popular vote, morethan double its 1989 performance. Most likely, it will bewaiting in the wings, with its complicated campaign pitch.Aside from raising the specter of a new era of Hindufundamentalism in India, the BJP promised a disciplined,uncorrupt party. That amounts to a frontal attack on theCongress, which has gained a reputation over the years forcorruption at almost all levels.</TEXT></DOC>
