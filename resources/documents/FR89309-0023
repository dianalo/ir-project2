Subsection (b) of section 7 is the provision that requires the Commissionto engage in conciliation, conference, and persuasion efforts before itcan institute court action under the ADEA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Section 6 of the Portal-to-Portal Act is made applicableby section 7(e)(1) of the ADEA to all litigation under the Act whetherbrought by the Commission or by private individuals. After considering the language of the statutory provision, overall statutoryscheme favoring voluntary compliance, its legislative background, and thecourt discussions on the subject of tolling, the Commission believes thatCongress neither required nor intended that the one year tolling periodprovided by section 7(e)(2) be applied only to suits brought by the government.It is the view of the Commission that once section 7(b) conciliation, conference,and persuasion have been commenced by the Commission, the period of tollingapplies regardless of whether the EEOC or a private party files an ADEAsuit after the attempt at informal resolution fails. This view of tolling is consistent with Congress' express preference inthe ADEA for voluntary settlement of age discrimination claims as wellas the experienced reality that unsuccessful section 7(b) conciliation,even of an allegation deemed meritorious by the government, may not alwaysresult in the Commission bringing suit. Thus, limiting tolling during section7(b) conciliation to the government's right of action encourages chargingparties to file protective suits, thereby derailing the voluntary settlementprocess, and may also reward employers for not engaging in prompt or seriousconciliation efforts.\2\<NOTE/> An interpretation applying section 7(e)(2) tolling to privateas well as government actions is fully consistent with the ADEA's statutoryscheme. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ For example, there may be persons with meritorious claimswho, at some point beyond the applicable statute of limitations but withinthe 1 year tolling period, learn that the government is not going to litigateon their behalf. It would not be in keeping with simple notions of fairness,nor with the concept that aggrieved individuals act as ``private attorneysgeneral'' under the ADEA, to interpret section 7(e) as tolling the timeframes solely for government suits. There is nothing in the statutory language of section 7(e)(2) or its legislativehistory which would contradict or prohibit an interpretation applying tollingto private litigants. The Conference Committee report stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Senate amendment amends section 7(e) of the act to provide thatthe statute of limitations as provided in section 6 of the Portal-to-PortalAct of 1947 shall be tolled (for a period not exceeding 2 years [conferenceagreement substituted 1 year]) during the period in which the Secretaryof Labor [now EEOC] is attempting to effect voluntary compliance pursuantto section 7(b). This amendment does not apply to conciliation requiredby section 7(d). House Conf. Report No. 95-950, supra, p. 13, 1978 U.S.Code Cong. and Admin. News, p. 534.</ITAG>This discussion does not limit the benefits of section 7(b) tolling exclusivelyto an action filed by the enforcement agency, it simply requires 7(b),as opposed to 7(d), conciliation efforts as a prerequisite for tolling.\3\<NOTE/> As was articulated as dictum in <T3>Fulton v. NCR Corp., </T3> 472 F. Supp. 377, 382 (W.D. Va. 1979):<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Section 7(d) conciliation simply requires the EEOC, uponreceiving a charge, to promptly notify all persons named as prospectivedefendants and to promptly seek to eliminate any alleged unlawful practiceby informal methods of conciliation, conference and persuasion. It is theinformal, predetermination action that promptly follows the filing of acharge and in no event can delay a private suit by more than 60 days.<ITAG tagnum="28">Section 7(b) conciliation follows written notice from the EEOC toprospective defendant(s) that it is prepared to commence conciliation pursuantto that section of the Act and is required before the Commission itselfcan file suit. Commission regulations provide that section 7(b) conciliationmay be commenced whenever the Commission has a reasonable basis to concludethat a violation of the ADEA has occurred or will occur (ordinarily issuedin the form of a Letter of Determination). 29 CFR 1626.15(b). </ITAG><T3>See also</T3> H.R.

(Emphasis in original).\4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Two other courts have stated in <T3>dicta</T3> in private ADEA actions that tolling under section 7(e)(2)was available for the time spent in conciliation. <T3>See Miller v. International Telephone and Telegraph Co.,</T3> 755 F.2d20, 24 (2d Cir. 1985), <T3>cert. denied,</T3> 474 U.S. 1015 (1985); and <T3>Vuksta v. Bethlehem Steel Corp.,</T3> 540 F. Supp. 1276, 1280 n. 13(E.D. Pa. 1982), <T3>aff'd without opinion,</T3> 707 F.2d 1405 (3d Cir. 1983), <T3> cert. denied,</T3> 464 U.S. 835 (1983).Three courts, including one court of appeals, have reached a differentconclusion, albeit without a thorough analysis of the question. In <T3>Heiar v. Crawford County,</T3> 746 F.2d 1190, 1196 (7th Cir. 1984),<T3>cert. denied,</T3> 472 U.S. 1027 (1985), the court, in an opinion byJudge Posner, stated, in <T3>dictum:</T3><ITAG tagnum="21">The conciliation referred to [in section 7(e)(2)]_conciliation undersection [7](b)_is that preceding suits by the EEOC. Conciliation in privateactions is provided for separately in section [7](d) * * *. The point isnot that there are different forms of conciliation; it is that only theEEOC can use the period of conciliation to toll the statute of limitations.</ITAG>In <T3>Leite v. Kennecott Copper Corp.,</T3> 558 F. Supp. 1170, 1172-73 (D.Mass.), <T3>aff'd without opinion,</T3> 720 F. 2d 658 (1st Cir. 1983), the courtheld that, notwithstanding the Commission's advice that its conciliationefforts would extend the statute of limitations for a charging party'sprivate suit, tolling was inapplicable. According to the court, the Commission'sadvice ``misstate[d] the law'' because sec. 7(e)(2)'s ``reference to [sec.7](b) makes clear [that] this tolling provision applies only to the conciliationefforts preceding the institution of legal action by the [government],not to those that might precede a private civil action.'' 558 F. Supp.1173 andamp; n. 1. Finally, in <T3>Hovey v. Lutheran Medical Center,</T3> 516 F. Supp. 554, 556 (E.D.N.Y.1981), the court, in holding that tolling was not available in a privatesuit, stated that ``the tolling provision of [sec. 7](e)(2) applies onlyto the conciliatory efforts required by [sec. 7](b) preceding the institutionof legal action by the Secretary [; it] does not refer to conciliationbefore a private civil action.,'' \5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ <T3>Hovey</T3> and <T3>Leite</T3> cite to and erroneously rely upon the decision in <T3>Fulton v. NCR Corp.,</T3> discussed earlier, which supports the oppositeview, <T3>i.e.,</T3> that tolling is available in a private action.The Commission believes that these decisions are unpersuasive and incorrecton the issue of tolling.\6\<NOTE/> The decisions discussed the issue, largely in dicta, onlyin a brief and conclusory manner without articulated reasoning and usingas authority the same legislative history discussed above that clearlydoes not mandate that tolling only applies to government actions. To thecontrary, the Commission views the legislative history and general structureof the ADEA enforcement scheme as evidencing Congress' understanding thatsection 7(b) conciliation and section 7(e)(2) tolling may occur in caseswhere the Commission does not ultimately bring suit. A clear indicationof this fact is the statement in the Conference Committee Report that tollingunder section 7(e)(2) ``begin[s] when the Department of Labor [now EEOC]states, in a letter to the prospective defendant(s), that it is preparedto commence conciliation pursuant to section 7(b) of the act.'' H.R. Conf.Rep. No. 950, 95 Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1978). Had Congress intended section7(e)(2) tolling to be limited to the government, it could easily have saidso. Instead of such a limitation, Congress stated in that section that``the statute of limitations,'' which applies to both private and governmentactions, ``shall be tolled.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ By letter dated February 26, 1979, the Department of Labor,then responsible for ADEA enforcement, expressed the view that sec. 7(e)tolling was limited to the government's right of action. For the reasonsdiscussed in the text, the Commission rejects this view.Therefore, the Commission believes that it is in the best interest of effectiveand efficient enforcement of the ADEA that the one-year tolling periodprovided by section 7(e)(2) be interpreted to apply to both Commissionand private litigation. In order to make this purpose clear, the Commissionhereby provides notice that it intends to modify its procedural regulationat 29 CFR 1626.15(b) to add the following statement at the conclusion ofthis subsection:<ITAG tagnum="21">This tolling period pursuant to section 7(e)(2) is applicable to bothCommission and private party litigation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Impact Analysis_Classification-Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The proposed rule in this document is not classified as a ``major rule''under Executive Order 12291 on Federal Regulations, because it is not likelyto result in (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Accordingly, no regulatory impact analysis is required.Similarly, the Chairman of the EEOC certifies under 5 U.S.C. Sec. 605(b),enacted by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), that this amendmentwill not result in a significant impact on a substantial number of smallemployers.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 1626</ITAG>Aged, Equal employment opportunity.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to amend 29 CFR 1626.15(b) as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1626_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
