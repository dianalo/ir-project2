Texaco shares closed Friday at $35.50, up $1.875, on Big Board volume of more than 7.2 million shares.    The oil company was rumored to be borrowing $2 billion from its banks Friday, possibly for a settlement of its legal battle with Houston-based Pennzoil Co. But late Friday afternoon, Texaco defused those rumors, announcing that it was merely discussing a proposed financing facility with the creditors committee in its bankruptcy law case.    Texaco filed April 12 for court protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code to forestall enforcement of a $10.3 billion judgment against it awarded to Pennzoil by a Texas court.    The company said the facility it was discussing with creditors was needed simply for working capital for routine operations.    Some traders had also attributed the action in Texaco stock to rumors that Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court may join forces with T. Boone Pickens Jr., the Texas oilman, to acquire Texaco. Both Mr. Holmes a Court and Mr. Pickens are believed to have bought Texaco shares for investment purposes.    But a source familiar with Mr. Holmes a Court and Mr. Pickens dismissed any such alliance, saying the rumors were &quot;absolutely untrue.&quot;    Mr. Holmes a Court is believed to have done some buying on Friday, however. Merrill Lynch Capital Markets crossed a one million-share block. Market sources said they believed that part of the block was bought for the Australian investor. As previously reported, he has said his Bell Resources Ltd. has credit lines of $7.04 billion available for takeovers. But one source warned that Mr. Holmes a Court &quot;is probably just playing the stock&quot; right now.    Mr. Holmes a Court couldn't be reached for comment over the weekend.    Several major institutional holders are also believed to have been heavy sellers on Friday. One trader selling for an institution said he didn't believe that Texaco was close to a settlement, and that the stock had shot up to a level higher than it had been in weeks. </TEXT></DOC>
