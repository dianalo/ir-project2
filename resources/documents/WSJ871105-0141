The imposition of stringent new settlement rules follows indications that a few Swedish firms may have been hurt significantly in the market's downturn, which has dragged the Affarsvarlden index down 30% since Oct. 15.    So far, two firms -- Oestgoeta Enskilda Banken and Civic Fondkommission AB -- have acknowledged big losses stemming from options trading last month. Civic was shut down by authorities Monday for unrelated securities-law violations. But no Swedish firms have closed as a direct consequence of the crash.    Nevertheless, in the past few days at least four major banks have implemented new settlement procedures in stock and bond trading with independent, or non-bank, brokerages. The banks -- Svenska Handelsbanken, Post andamp; Kreditbanken, Goetabanken and Foersta SparBanken, a savings bank -- are among the biggest players on Sweden's financial markets.    Spokesmen for the four banks confirmed that their securities and money market divisions now insist on cash or certified bank-draft payments from independent brokerages.    However, officials at other banks, including Sweden's biggest commercial bank, Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, said they haven't seen a need yet to change settlement requirements. </TEXT></DOC>
