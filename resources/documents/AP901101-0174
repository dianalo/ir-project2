The announcement, made in a speech to the House of Commons, camefour months after the failure of the Meech Lake accord, which wasaimed at winning the signature of French-speaking Quebec on the1982 constitution.   Mulroney also spoke five days before a Quebec commission is tobegin its own work reconsidering the ties that bind Quebec toCanada.   ``The situation is urgent ... the problem is serious,'' Mulroneysaid.   He said the new federal forum is made up of Canadians from allwalks of life, though none is a politician. Its mandate will be toseek consensus on what people want from Canada and what they wantCanada to be.   ``The idea is to have people who are not `tainted' bypartisanship,'' said Harvie Andre, House leader of the governingConservatives.   The new forum is to report back to the government by July 1,Canada's national holiday.   The Meech Lake accord failed in June, when the legislatures ofManitoba and Newfoundland decided against ratifying it.   Their refusal to sign angered many of the 6.7 million Quebecersand touched off huge protests across Quebec. Some demonstratorsdemanded that Quebec separate from Canada.   Recent polls show that 60 percent of Quebecers favor a newstatus for Quebec, with options ranging from greater autonomy tofull independence.   French-speaking Quebecers, known as Quebecois, are a minorityamong Canada's 26 million people. They have long felt treated assecond-class citizens by English-speaking Canada. The French fearthat without special measures and privileges, their culture will beoverwhelmed by English Canada.   The Meech Lake agreement would have designated Quebec as a``distinct society'' and given it and the other provinces morepower in such areas as Supreme Court appointments and Senatereform. The ``distinct society'' clause did little more thanacknowledge the obvious, but it was of tremendous symbolicimportance to the French speakers.   ``It's time we all did some soul searching,'' Mulroney said,acknowledging that finding a consensus will not be easy.   In a country where all citizens are legally equal, how can thespecial needs of the French-speaking minority as well as nativesand residents of the poor Atlantic provinces be accmmodated, theprime minister asked.   It seems clear there will be some change in the relationshipbetween Quebec and the rest of Canada after the failure of MeechLake. The only question seems to be how far down the road tosovereignty the Quebecois want to go.   Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa clearly does not want separation.   Justice Minister Gil Remillard said recently that both thestatus quo and total independence are out of the question.   In any case, it's unlikely that most Quebecois will be tooexcited about Mulroney's commission.   ``They are not hanging on the results of this exercise,'' saidRichard French, a former Quebec minister. ``They are hanging on the(findings of the Quebec) commission,'' he said.   That 36-member group, known as the Commission on the Politicaland Constitutional Future of Quebec, is to issue its report inMarch.   Richard Spicer, the former head of the Canadian Radio,Television and Telecommunications Commission, is heading thegovernment forum.   ``The assignment is awesome,'' he said. ``The procedures areill-defined and completely untested. The outcome is entirelydubious, and there is a very high potential for fiasco.''   But he added, ``We all think that Canada deserves anotherchance.''   ``We are cordially inviting the politicians to keep their nosesout of this; they are not welcome,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
