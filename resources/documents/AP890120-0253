The dollar finished at 128.05 yen, down 1.15 yen from Thursday's129.20-yen close. The currency, which opened at 128.25 yen, moved ina range of 128.00-128.65 yen.   The currency opened lower following a round of central bankintervention in European countries and the United States, said adealer with a major commercial bank in Tokyo, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   But the dollar's downward move is likely to be a temporary trend,he added.   Finance Minister Tatsuo Murayama told a press conference todaythat currency rates ``didn't move much,'' and have already returnedto their level before the joint intervention.   But Murayama hinted the United States could move to raise its owninterest rates due to inflation worries.   Other dealers said trading was not active ahead ofPresident-elect Bush's inauguration speech later today, as investorswere concerned Bush might indicate a new monetary policy.   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which shed 43.15 points theprevious day, lost another 141.02 points, or 0.45 percent, to fallfurther to 31,170.37. The index, which lost 233.16 points at the endof the morning trading, could not erase the loss although it startedto recover during the afternoon session.   Volume traded on the first section was estimated at 1.1 billionshares.   Following a 0.5 percentage-point interest rate hike in severalEuropean nations including West Germany, Switzerland and France, theindex quickly plunged as investors moved to the sidelines or soldfor profit- taking, said a Nikko Securities dealer.   ``Now investors are mainly concerned how the U.S. monetaryauthorities would react. But the majority think that the U.S.central bank would maintain current discount rates even if it raisesthe prime lending rate,'' the dealer said.</TEXT></DOC>
