Applicability area of the observed IR-radiationis demonstrated, which includes works related to IR-radiation detectorcalibration; radiation materials science works on measuring the materialcharacteristics in IR-region (transmission and reflection coefficients);works connected with investigation into semiconducting material streucture,photoconductivity process study. Collective accelerator electron ringsmay also serve as an effective raiation source in the vacuum ultravioletspectral region. 9 refs.; 4 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
