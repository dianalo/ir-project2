As a new mother, Iagonized over the decision to go back to work when mydaughter was only 2 1/2 months old. When I read your articleI realized how fortunate I am that my job requires me to beaway from her for only eight or nine hours a day. I cannotimagine having to leave her for months at a time. Leavingyour child in order to defend your country is truly an act ofbravery. I am very sorry they had to go, but very gratefulthat they were willing to do so.
