The Commerce Department said the trade deficit rose to $10.9billion in May from a revised $10.3 billion in April, but thenumber was still the second smallest in almost three years and wellwithin economists' expectations.   Imports rose 3.4 percent to about $37.6 billion, but theincrease was offset by a 2.3 percent increase in exports, whichrose to about $26.6 billion, very close to the record level forexports set in March.   The Labor Department said wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.4percent in June, despite a searing drought that sent prices for rawfood soaring at their steepest pace in more than 2{ years.   In other reports released today, the Federal Reserve said Juneindustrial production rose 0.4 percent, largely because of higherelectricity output, and the Commerce Department said May businessinventories rose 0.6 percent, which suggested a slight slowdown insales.   But those reports weren't watched as closely as the news ontrade and inflation, which was better than many thought and sentmoney traders scrambling to buy dollars. The currency's strongadvance prompted some central banks to sell dollars in the marketto stem the rise, traders reported.   In New York, the dollar surged over 1.8750 marks in hectictrading, compared with 1.8507 late Thursday, and 135.10 Japaneseyen compared with 133.18 late Thursday. The British pound fell to$1.662 from $1.689.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials roseabout 7 points to the 2,121 level in early trading, but retreatedby late morning. In the bond market, the Treasury's key 30-yearissue also rose on the trade and inflation news but fell back laterand was little changed by late morning.   On Thursday, the markets reacted indifferently to a hike in theprime rate by major banks from 9 percent to 9.5 percent, thehighest in more than two years. Stocks and the dollar rose slightlyand bonds were mixed.   The banks' hike in the prime rate, which had been widelyexpected in the financial markets, reflected a rise in their ownborrowing costs and signaled more expensive loans for consumers andbusinesses.   The move marked the second time this year the nation's bankshave raised the prime, which is used to calculate a range offixed-and adjustable-rate corporate and consumer loans.   Economists had been expecting such a move because of evidencethat the Federal Reserve has tightened credit over the past fewmonths in an attempt to curb inflation.   The rate increase came one day after the central bank'schairman, Alan Greenspan, told Congress that the Fed had beentightening and that holding down inflation remained his keypriority. Some economists saw a significant connection between hisremarks and the banks' action.
