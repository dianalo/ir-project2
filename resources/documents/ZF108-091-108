 And slides are static; you can't use them todemonstrate programs or present animated sequences.andM;In this article and the one that follows, we will explore two ways that youcan get your desktop presentations onto the big screen.andP;  Here, we look at LCDpanels, the low-cost and portable solutions to the problem.andM;THE TECHNOLOGYandM;An LCD panel is simple in concept.andP;  Though there is some variation in designamong models and manufacturers, all the systems are quite similar.andO;Basically, they are notebook-size panels that are placed on the projectionstage of a standard overhead projector.andP;  A rectangular window in the middleof the unit holds a clear panel, and sandwiched between layers of glass (orplastic) is a liquid crystal display (LCD), much like those used in portablecomputers.andP;  (See the sidebar &quot;A Closer Look at LCD Panel Technology.&quot;)andM;These panels do not work with all overhead projectors; some of the new,lighter-weight projectors; designs sport a light mounted above the projectionstage, relying on reflected light.andP;  This type of projector won't work withmost LCD panels since they sit too high off the stage, and the angled lightcan produce a blurred or doubled image.andM;The LACD panels do function with projectors where the light is located in thebottom.andP;  The light from the overhead projector shines up through the paneland is displayed on a screen.andM;THE ADVANTAGESandM;LCD panels can be rather light, typically weighing in at less than 10 pounds,including an external power supply.andP;  This is because almost all the heavycomponents are part of the overhead projector: large cooling fans, lenses,mirrors, and sturdy housing.andM;Another advantage is that most offices, conference centers, and hotelsalready have overhead projectors on hand.andP;  This means that you can travelwith just your LCD panel and be fairly certain you will have what you need atyour destination.andP;  If you want to be absolutely certain, there are a numberof overhead porjectors--from companies like 3M, Eastman Kodak, and Buhl--thatfold into a briefcase-size carrying case.andP;  With one of these, your LCD panel,and a laptop computer, you have all you need to stage your show.andM;Overhead projectors are relatively bright compared with some othertechnologies, and you can often use an LCD panel in a room with most of thelights on.andP;  In fact, if you are stuck without a projector screen, these LCDpanels are usually bright enough to stage a display on a blank wall.andM;Since the panel hooks up directly to your computer, you can display yourdesktop presentation images directly on the screen.andP;  You can also demonstrateprograms interactively, which is excellent for training purposes.andP;  There isno complicated setup or focusing involved, which means you can move yourequipment from room to room and still be ready to go in just a few minutes.andM;Perhaps best of all, the relatively simple technology used in LCD panelsmakes them attractive values.andP;  The models tested the range in price from $895to $4,995, far less than large monitors such as the 37-inch MitsubishiDiamond Scan, which lists for a cool $7,599.andM;All these advantages have made LCD panels the projection technology of choicefor many users.andP;  Teachers in schools and corporate trainers can mix textslides and live program demonstrations with ease.andP;  Sales representatives cancarry their presentations with them and even work out bids or proposalson-screen as the client watches.andP;  And many users appreciate the fact thatthey can make changes in their presentations right up until the last moment.andM;SOME PROBLEMSandM;LCD panels are not the perfect answer to the presentation dilemma, however.andO;They have their problems, largely as a result of the limits of theirtechnology.andM;One major problem for some of these products is their resolution.andP;  The firstpanels were strictly limited to CGA resolution; despite their courser images,some of these products still survive, in large part because many laptops arestill not capable of higher-resolution images.andP;  (If you have a laptop thatyou intend to use with an LCD panel, make sure to match the panel'scapabilities with the signal your portable can produce.)andP;  Fortunately, amongthe high-end panels, you will now find various models that support VGA andMacintosh high-resolution modes.andM;Another problem is that most panels don't show true color.andP;  In fact, in thisreview, you'll read about the first LCD color panel.andP;  All the others arevariations on a monochrome theme: older panel designs often project a blueimage on a yellow background, or magenta and blue images on a yellowbackground.andP;  Newer designs have color-compensated LCDs, and these produce ablack-on-white image.andM;Since these panels are all essentially monochrome displays, they must rely ondifferent techniques to represent colors.andP;  The better designs can displayeight or more shades of gray, which are then mapped to different colors.andO;Others use a dithering method in which patterns represent different shades.andO;Some panels offer a choice between these two approaches, while others usecombinations of gray shades and patterns.andP;  No matter what method is used,most panels offer some way to change the color-mapping so as to produce themost legible display for different combinations of colors.andM;A pair of related factors--brightness and contrast--also affect the qualityof the projected image.andP;  Since the panels rely on the light of the overheadprojector, brightness depends on how much of this light passes through thepanel to end up on the screen.andP;  Contast refers to the degree of differencebetween the light and dark parts of the image.andP;  As it turns out, panels thathave good contrast tend to transmit less light overall, so they produce animage that is sharper but not as bright as other designs.andM;One other problem that affects the image quality is the fact that overheadprojectors tend to produce a fair amount of heat.andP;  As the LCD layer in apanel gets hot, the light transmission qualities of the panel change.andP;  If theheat is evenly distributed, you can simply adjust the contrast control andmaintain a high-quality image.andP;  If the heating is uneven, the changes will beuneven: adjusting one portion of the screen to optimal contrast may mean thatthe other portions of the screen become illegible.andM;This heat effect is called blooming, and panel manufacturers have devised anumber of solutions.andP;  Most panels have internal fans to cool the LCD layer,and some even have special infrared-absorbing layers to help dissipate theheat from the projector.andP;  As you will see in the reviews, some projectors aremore successful at keeping cool than others.andM;THE DIFFERENCESandM;Since many of these panels are made by one manufacturer but sold underdifferent labels, you will find some striking similarities among thesesystems.andP;  You will also, however, find a number of differences that couldaffect your buying decision.andP;  Keep in mind the following points when decidingon the LCD panel that's best for you.andM;First and foremost, be careful in your evaluation of our performance testresults.andP;  Since many of the measurements rely on the subjective adjustment ofthe panels to what appeared to be the best contrast setting, there isconsiderable room for experimental error.andP;  Comparing the results foridentical panels from different vendors indicates that this margin can be aslarge as 10 percent.andP;  Therefore, you should discount differences betweenpanels where the results are within this band of uncertainty.andM;The major performance differences are in transmissivity and contrast; asmentioned earlier, you often have to sacrifice one to get the other.andP;  Duringthe testing, we found that we preferred the panels with higher contrast overthose with greater transmissivity, but the extra brightness of the latter maybe more important in some applications.andM;Other differences lie in the features and options.andP;  Most units have controlpanels that permit adjustments such as contrast settings and color-mappingpalette selections.andP;  Some of the panels provide controls that are easier tofind and more intuitive than the competition's.andP;  Many panels we tested alsocome with infrared remote controls that make it possible to activate theseadjustments from a distance.andM;Some panels have provisions that permit you to hook up a monitor--in additionto the panel--adjacent to your overhead projector.andP;  Others have a monitorconnector located on the computer end of the cable; this may indicate thatthe monitor needs to be some distance from the overhead.andP;  Still others haveno provision for a monitor connection at all, although most of these panelmanufacturers offered the required cables or connectors as an extra-costoption.andM;On-screen help information guides you through the different controls on somesystems.andP;  A number of other units include slide-show programs.andP;  One paneleven offers an optional tablet that you can use to write on the screenelectronically--perfect for all those budding Coach Maddens who long for away to scribble over pass-pattern diagrams.andM;All in all, there is something here for nearly every taste, every budget, andevery need.andP;  Keep in mind that we asked for only two panels from eachvendor--usually the top and bottom models from their product lines.andP;  Manycompanies offer other models with different capabilities, something you maywant to keep in mind if you don't see what you need right away.andP;  If you alsoneed a projector, you may be interested in the companies that will sell youan LCD panel and overhead projector in a single package.andM;An LCD panel make make your desktop presentation that much more graceful, notto mention visible.andP;  Just pop your portable into its tote bag, grab somedisks with your favorite graphics or slide-show software, pick up your panel,and head out the door.andP;  You|re ready to take your snow on the road!andM;A CHECKLIST OF DESKTOPandM;PRESENTATION TECHNOLOGIESandM;In addition to LCD panels and data projectors (the two PC presentation toolswe review in this issue), numerous other options are available to bring yourdesktop-computer presentations to bigger screens.andP;  Of course, the choicesvary in terms of cost and benefits.andP;  Listed below are some of the mainalternatives, presented in order of overall cost.andM;OVERHEAD TRANSPARENCIES FROMandM;PLOTTERS OR PRINTERSandM;PORTABILITY: Light, but transparencies can get scrambled if dropped.andM;FLEXIBILITY: Easy to create (though plotters can be slow); easy toresequence.andM;REQUIREMENTS: An overhead projector (common in most meeting rooms).andP;  Screenpreferred but dispensable in a pinch.andP;  Room need not be darkened much.andM;IMAGE QUALITY: Fair to good, Remember that laser printer output is only blackand white, and plotters can produce uneven quality.andM;INVESTMENT: Price of plotter or printer (if you don't already own one).andM;PER-IMAGE COST: About $0.60 and up per sheet.andM;35MM SLIDES PREPARED BYandM;SERVICE BUREAUandM;PORTABILITY: Loaded in a carousel, slides are easy to carry and they stay insequence.andM;FLEXIBILITY: At least a few days' lead time to create them, but once they aremade, they are relatively easy to resequence.andM;REQUIREMENTS: A slide projector and screen, and a fairly dark room.andM;IMAGE QUALITY: Good to excellent.andM;INVESTMENT: None.andM;PER-IMAGE COST: About $10 and up per slide.andM;LCD PANELSandM;PORTABILITY: Fairly light but bulky; the weight at lest doubles if you bringalong a laptop computer.andM;FLEXIBILITY: Using graphics and slideshow shotware, you can change sequenceand edit images right up to the last minute; you can also run live programson-screen.andM;REQUIREMENTS: An overhead projector and a slightly darker room than withstandard overheads; screen preferred but not absolutely necessary.andM;IMAGE QUALITY: Poor to fair, depending on panel in use; most are monochrome,which is not nearly as good as vivid, full-color images.andM;INVESTMENT: About $895 to $4,995, plus cost of laptop if necessary.andM;PER-IMAGE COST: No extra cost.andM;IN-HOUSE 33MM SLIDESandM;PORTABILITY: Same as that of slides from a service bureau.andM;FLEXIBILITY: Shorter production time with in-house equipment.andM;REQUIREMENTS: Film recorder, slide projector, and screen; room must be fairlydark.andM;IMAGE QUALITY: Good to excellent.andM;INVESTMENT: $2,000 to more than $200,000.andM;PER-IMAGE COST: About $1 per slide.andM;LARGE CRT MONITORSandM;(35- TO 37-INCH)andM;PORTABILITY: Can be moved from room to room but are heavy.andM;FLEXIBILITY: They can hook directly to computer or VCR units, and they havethe same last minute-changed capability as LCD panels.andM;REQUIREMENTS: Room need not be darkened much, if any.andM;IMAGE QUALITY: Excellent.andM;INVESTMENT: Approximately $8,00.andM;PER-IMAGE COST: No extra cost.andM;DATA PROJECTORSandM;PORTABILITY: Typically mounted permanently; must be readjusted if moved.andM;FLEXIBILITY: They can hook directly to computer or VCR units, and they havethe same last-minute-change capability as LCD panels.andM;REQUIREMENTS: Room must be dark.andM;IMAGE QUALITY: Good to excellent.andM;INVESTMENT: From $2,500 (projectors with CGA resolution) to more than$150,000 (high-quality light-valve projectors); VGA three-beam models rangefrom $8,500 to more than $15,000.andM;PER-IMAGE COST: No extra cost.andM;THE LITTLEST LCD PANELandM;Not all LCD panels designed for overhead projectors are built to connect toPCs--some have computers built right in.andP;  In addition, there's one that youcan slip into your pocket.andM;It may be hard to believe, but the Casio FX-7000G/OHP is just such a machine.andO;A $79.95 calculator, it actually serves double duty as an LCD display panelfor overhead projectors.andM;Like many standard calculators, the FX-7000G/OHP uses an LCD window todisplay results; it can show eight lines of 16 characters.andP;  It also comescomplete with dedicated keys for a variety of mathematical functions (as domany other calculators), such as trigonometric calculations and regressionanalysis.andP;  And, like others of its ilk, it is even programmable.andM;Some calculators can display graphics and the FX-7000G/OHP is one of them.andO;Enter an equation, punch a button, and you get a graph drawn in a 96- by64-pixel display.andM;The FX-7000G/OHP, however, truly steps out of the crowd the moment you lay iton an overhead projector; the projector light shines through a window in theback so that the image can be seen on the screen.andM;Admittedly, it would be tough to design a presentation that would come closeto anything you might create with a laptop, a simple slide show program, anda full-size LCD panel.andP;  The FX-7000G/OHP was designed primarily for theschoolroom, aimed at science and math classes where the teacher wants todemonstrate calculations or graph results.andM;While it may be a far more informal presentation tool that a PC-based system,the FX-7000G/OHP can't be beat for portability and ease-of-use.andP;  It might bejust the ticket for those departmental budget meetings, or for working outhow to split the lunch bill so that everyone can see the numbers.andM;LCD PANELS: HIGH-CONTRAST IMAGESandM;AT HIGH RESOLUTIONSandM;While early LCD panel designs were limited to CGA resolution andblue-on-yellow images, the latest models offer VGA resolution andhigh-contrast black-and-white images.andP;  The best systems produce images witheasy-to-read characters on a uniform background--in color, to boot--like thisone created with nVIEW's ViewFrame II+2.andP;  The image is good, although itstill does not equal the display on the VGA color monitor pictured next toit.andM;But while the first color LCD panel has now arrived on the market, it looksas if we will have to wait a little longer before we see reasonably priceddisplays with both a wide range of color and a good image.andM;NVIEW'S VIEWFRAME II + 2andM;The best of the LCD panels help you make the most of your presentations byoffering support for high-resolution modes and eight or more levels of gray,as well as excellent contrast and elegant controls.andM;The ViewFrame II + 2 LCD panel meets all these requirements producing animage with excellent contrast and sharp focus.andP;  Its gray scale of eightshades lets you represent eight colors so they can be clearly discerned onthe screen.andM;The controls on the panel are quite good.andP;  You can make very fine adjustmentsto the levels of red, green, and blue being translated into shades of gray.andO;The contrast knob gives you a full range of control.andM;nVIEW built the ViewFrame II + 2 to withstand the rigors of traveling fromone presentation to the next.andP;  The housing around the double supertwistnematic panel is metal rather than plastic.andP;  for even better protection nVIEWprovides an American Tourister hard-shell carrying case as part of thestandard system.andM;Other standard accessories are three Y cables that connect a CGA/EGA, VGA, orMacintosh system and a very useful utility disk that makes adjusting thepanel's gray scale quite easy.andP;  With the Y cable you can run a monitor andthe panel at the same time.andM;Even though the panel costs $1,995 you get a lot of value for your money.andO;Given the very good image, sturdy design, and nice accessories, the ViewFrameII + 2 is hard to beat.andM;Honorable mention goes to In Focus Systems' 480C PC Viewer.andP;  This VGAresolution system heralds a new generation of true color LCD panels.andP;  Itseight colors are stunning, its clear image provides great contrast, and bloomproblems are nonexistent.andP;  Unevently weighted text was a problem, but if youneed color the $4,995 system is a worthwhile albeit expensive answer.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
