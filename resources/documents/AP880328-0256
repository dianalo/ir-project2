However, Furr's must hold the stores separately pending thefinal sale of 12 Safeways in New Mexico and Texas to Jaynes GroupInc., according to the FTC.   The Jaynes Group is a newly formed corporation organized byformer Safeway employees. Both it and Lubbock-based Furr's areprivately held and did not disclose the amount of the transactions.   Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. of New York acquired Safeway in1986 in a $4.3 billion leveraged buyout to fend off a hostiletakeover by the Dart Group of Maryland. It has been selling offwhole divisions to pay off its debt.   During the four-month FTC review period, Furr's operated the 59stores as an autonomous division.   Furr's now operates 154 retail grocery stores in Texas and NewMexico. It also operates two distribution centers and severalsupport offices.   The FTC's only objection to Furr's purchase of Safeway's El Pasodivision was that it would have a monopoly in 12 New Mexico andTexas cities.   Furr's reached an agreement with the Jayne's Group to buy thestores, which are in the Texas cities of Pecos and Fort Stocktonand the New Mexico cities of Alamogordo, Artesia, Clovis, Espanola,Hobbs, Las Vegas, Lovington, Portales, Roswell and Silver City.</TEXT></DOC>
