<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-09-1104 </DOCNO><TEXT>The differential diagnosis of pain in the leg has to be made very carefullyin the period of growth in order to avoid non-detection of severe disease.The diagnosis 'growing-pain' is a dangerous, unsupported diagnosis, asthe pain is taken to be somewhat normal and is not taken seriously, atleast not seriously enough to induce careful observation. The contributionin hand discusses all aspects very carefully, starting with the compilationof the case history and the clinical examination of patients complainingabout pain in the leg. From the variety of probable diseases, the authordiscusses in particular the chondropathies and aseptic bone necrosesin the lower extremity, the separation of the epiphysis or apophysis,traumata, arthritic diseases, osteitic diseases, bone tumors, and theeffects of an axis shift or deformation. Exact clinical and radiologicalexaminations in most of the cases will allow a proper diagnosis. In caseof diagnostic uncertainties, blood chemistry or bone scintigraphy areuseful tools for making a clear diagnosis. In no case, however, uncertaincauses of pain should be covered with the diagnosis of growing-pain,but instead require frequent follow-up examination of the patient.</TEXT></DOC>
