This week, U.S. Transportation Secretary SamSkinner boxed the British in when he rejected BritishAirways' plan to slash trans-Atlantic fares this summer.British Air, now privately owned, is in a financial nose diveand needs to sell seats. Some U.S. carriers matched thosecuts.   The controversy stems from a complex series of grievancesboth sides have against the other. Mr. Skinner wants theBritish government to allow the transfer of existing U.S.landing rights at Heathrow Airport to United Airlines andAmerican Airlines. The British say the current airlineagreement for congested Heathrow stipulates that only Pan Amand TWA may land there. Both Pan Am and TWA say they may notsurvive unless they can complete the sale of their Heathrowlanding rights.</LP><TEXT>   The British say they are willing to allow the switch, butin return they want permission for British carriers to carrypassengers from one U.S. city to another -- from, say,Detroit to catch a connecting flight to London. Britishairlines also want to be able to own larger portions of U.S.carriers than current law allows.   U.S. negotiators say the British are unfairly using theirleverage over capacity-controlled Heathrow, and that it isthe U.S. side that wants an open-skies policy. &quot;The Britishwant to cut fares now, but last year they rejected over 400requests from U.S. carriers for fare changes,&quot; RichardIkland, a transportation economist, told us.   The root cause of all these disputes is that air servicebetween the two countries is set by an obsolete agreementthat gives either government the right to reject new,innovative services or fares. The U.S. wants to scrap theagreement and allow the airlines to do what they do best,anticipate demand and set fares accordingly. The Britishresponse has been to mumble some platitudes about &quot;nationalsovereignty.&quot;   The solution to all this, as in so much of economicpolicy, is to follow the set of policies that benefitconsumers most. That means allowing the British, andeventually other carriers, to fly U.S. domestic routes. Itmeans having the British open up Heathrow and Gatwickairports to more competition by auctioning off landingrights. And it means letting consumers take advantage ofprice cuts any time an airline wants to offer them. Those arealso the kinds of policies that are most likely to helpcreate a genuinely global economy, benefiting all buyers ofthe world's products. The costs of not pursuing such policiesare large: This week an aviation consulting firm reportedthat limits on air travel between the U.S. and Canada costboth nations $9.5 billion a year in lost economic activity.   Mr. Skinner's refusal to permit British Airways to cutfares is a restraint of free trade. If nothing else it servesto finally make clear the folly of having a government nannypolice the economics of North Atlantic airline routes. Withboth nations fighting an aggressor in the Persian Gulf, nowis hardly the time for them to be engaged in an unseemly turfrow over an airline industry that needs all the freedom ofoperation it can get to survive financially.</TEXT></DOC>
