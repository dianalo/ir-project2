This rule makes a number of revisions to ExportControl Commodity Number (ECCN) 1565A of the CCL, which controls electroniccomputers and related equipment. These revisions have resulted from a reviewof strategic controls maintained by the U.S. and certain allied countriesin cooperation with the Coordinating Committee (COCOM). Such multilateralcontrols restrict the availability of strategic items to controlled countries.These revisions are made pursuant to the provisions of section 5 of theExport Administration Act of 1979, as amended.In addition, ECCN 6565G, which covers personal computers excepted fromexport controls under ECCN 1565A, is amended to reflect that the personalcomputers removed from 1565A remain subject to validated license requirementsfor exports to destinations in Country Group S or Z and to certain consigneesin South Africa and Namibia.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Effective Date:</T2> This rule is effective August 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For further information contact:</T2> Joseph Young, Computer SystemsTechnology Center, Bureau of Export Administration, Telephone: (202) 377-2279.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Bureau of Export Administration (BXA) maintains the Commodity ControlList (CCL), which identifies those items subject to Department of Commerceexport controls. Export Control Commodity Number (ECCN) 1565A of the CCLcontrols electronic computers and related equipment.On July 18, 1989, BXA issued an interim rule amending ECCN 1565A, in accordancewith a determination of foreign availability under section 5(f) of theExport Administration Act of 1979, as amended. Under that rule, validatedlicensing requirements were removed for exports to most Western countriesof certain personal computers (those with characteristics specified inthe <T3>Validated License Required</T3> paragraph of ECCN 1565A).This final rule removes national security based validated licensing requirementson exports of certain personal computers to all destinations and supersedesthe interim rule published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 18, 1989 (54 FR 30011). BXA is issuingthis final rule based on a review of strategic controls maintained by theU.S. and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Committee (COCOM).Comments are invited on a continuing basis, including comments on the interimrule of July 18. However, the Department does not at this time anticipatemaking additional changes because this decontrol is based on multilateralagreement.COCOM's latest review of strategic controls has resulted in agreement todecontrol certain types of personal computers. Those personal computersdescribed in a new paragraph (h)(2)(vii) of ECCN 1565A now require a validatedlicense for foreign policy reasons for exports to destinations in CountryGroups S and Z and to certain consignees in South Africa and Namibia. TheDepartment of Commerce has determined that this rule is consistent withthe provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended.Pursuant to multilateral agreement, this rule also amends three ECCN 1565AAdvisory Notes:(a) Advisory Note 7 is amended to clarify that ``minimum quantities'' means``a reasonable quantity not exceeding a 6-month supply'' for purposes ofshipping certain electronic computer spare parts;(b) Advisory Note 9 is amended to extend eligibility to certain digitalcomputers or related equipment with 16 bit systems that are portable orruggedized; and(c) Advisory Note 16 is amended to reflect the removal of certain personalcomputers from control under ECCN 1565A, by defining ``personal computer.''ECCN 6565G, which covers controls on personal computers excepted from exportcontrols under ECCN 1565A, is amended to reflect that validated licensescontinue to be required for exports of personal computers removed fromECCN 1565A to destinations in Country Groups S and Z and to certain consigneesin South Africa and Namibia.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule involves a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). The effect will be to reduce the paperwork burden onexporters of these personal computers. This collection has been approvedby the Office of Management and Budget under control number 0694-0005.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared.5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. Section 13(b) of theEAA does not require that this rule be published in proposed form becausethis rule does not impose a new control. Further, no other law requiresthat a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for public commentbe given for this rule.Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, comments from thepublic are always welcome. Comments should be submitted to Patricia Muldonian,Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, Bureau of Export Administration,Department of Commerce, P.O.
