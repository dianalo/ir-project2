Polymer injection commenced inFebruary, 1986 at a concentration of 1500 ppm. Due to lower than expectedviscosity with produced brine, injection was switched to lower salinityBelly River source water. This change has improved viscosity withoutaffecting injectivity and enabled a decrease in polymer concentrationto 1100 ppm. Infill drilling approximately doubled production to 80 m/sup3/ OPD in 1985. A response to the polymerflood is indicated by a decreasingwater/oil ration and increasing oil production trend. Polymer breakthroughhas occurred in several wells but has remained at a very low concentration.3 refs., 4 tabs., 10 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
