(learning to be a programmer has becomemuch more difficult) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>May, Jules.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>The growing power and complexity of computers are making it verydifficult to become a programmer.andP;  It was much easier in the earlydays of microcomputers, when BASIC was the standard programminglanguage in schools, there were few off-the-shelf applications andsophisticated games, the minimal gap between the programmer andthe system enabled the programmer to see how the code worked andcompanies provided the 'correct' training environment.andO;Unfortunately, a lot of schools are still teaching BASIC, whichhas little applicability with the sophistication of currentcomputers and arcade games.andP;  Colleges do not know what to teachbecause the field is changing so fast.andP;  The programming knowledgeand skills a programmer picks up in school are no guarantee of ajob, because a programmer will have little relevant background toshow that they will be good at their work.andP;  A new programmer willfind it difficult to enter a programming operation because of theimmense libraries of code that must be understood and the manylayers of insulation between the programmer and the system.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     ProgrammersProgramming InstructionComputer LiteracyEducationTrainingTrendsAnalysis.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>While poking around in my loft the other day, I found my first computer.andP;  Itwas pretty pathetic today's standards, but it was not bad for its time.andP;  Ibuilt it myself, because in those deays that was the only way to get acomputer one could play with.andM;It had 128-bytes of RAM.andP;  It wasn't a lot, but it was enough to do usefulthings in.andP;  Back then, computing was regarded as a branch of electronics, andit was taken for granted that one worked close to the metal.andP;  Indeed, therewas not even a word to distinguish between this kind of work and theabstractions we use today.andP;  In common with all the programmers I knew then, Iknew the entire instruction set by heart, programmed in hex, and could readpaper tape.andP;  Thinking back, I can't even remember what I did with it, sodivorced was it from today's machines.andM;As I left school, computers were just being put in.andP;  Schools werestandardising on BASIC, not because it was a productive way to work, butbecause it was easy to teach.andP;  As a result, a whole generation of teenagersgraduated from school thinking they could program.andP;  Off-the-shelfapplications were very thin on the ground, and were expensive - games evenmore so - so few pupils got the chance to see what commercial software lookedlike, (and few teachers as well, if truth be told).andP;  A lot of smallbusinessmen had nasty experiences with computers that had been programmed forthem by these whizz-kids.andM;Putting computers into schools was not a bad idea, although it could havebeen done much better.andP;  Once someone understood what a program was, and howit did its work, the colleges and universities had a much easier job teachinghim to write real programs, on real machines.andP;  Some institutions even rose tothis challenge and did teach these things!andP;  But the real learning came on thejob - a wannabe would get employment with a company which would immerse himin the correct environment, and he would pick up concepts like defensiveprogramming, complexity, and idle-time processing from people who wereconversant with such ideas (even though, back in those days, such ideas stillhad not been named).andP;  The gap between the programmers and the machine was notthat great - perhaps one layer of compilation, and a library or two - so thetrainee could easily get the feel of how his code was working.andM;I feel very lucky, because I became aware of computers while they were stillvery young, and comparatively little real work had been done.andP;  I have beenwell placed to follow the developments in computer technology, because i havehad time to understand one development before the next one came along.andP;  Forsomeone coming into the field now, the story is very different - computersare not so sophisticated it is barely possible to follow this track.andP;  Pupilsat school see arcade games in cafes, they see computer games at home, andthere is no way to connect that kind of thing with what is being taught tothem.andP;  How can you program something like 'F16' in BASIC?andP;  Modern software isfast, pretty and largely mode-less, and none of the established teachingmethods can cope with that, being (as they are) almost entirelygoal-oriented.andM;So how do you teach people to write programs?andP;  Our wannabes have decided theywant to be programmers, and they have been taught BASIC instead, so they goto college to learn the next step.andP;  The problem now is that the collegesdon't know what the next step is either - the field is moving so fast that bythe time something has been crystallised into a course, it is already out ofdate.andP;  All the stuff that used to be learned on the job is there, and that iscertainly useful, but the students still are no nearer to being able to writecommercial software.andM;The next step (for those people who still want to program for a living) is toget a job.andP;  From everyone's point of view, this is the hardest step of all.andO;Now, more than ever, giving a job to a graduate is buying a pig in a poke -the employer can have very little idea whether the applicant is going to beany good at the job, because the applicant is unlikely to have anythingremotely relevant to show him.andP;  From the applicant's point of view, to bepart of a programming team, no matter how small a part, there is so much hehas to know.andP;  The computers are immensely complicated (and few companiesprogram for just one machine now), there are layers and layers of insulationbetween the programmer and the machine, and huge libraries which have to beunderstood before any work at all can start.andP;  The only way to learn all thisis to do the job, but you can't do the job until you know it.andP;  How doesanyone learn to program these days?andM;I do know a few people who have completed (or have nearly completed) a formaleducation, and are now very good programmers.andP;  In every case, though, theyare good not because of anything they have been taught, but because they havean instinctive feel for what is going on, and their education has filled ingaps rather than provided the foundation.andP;  As time goes on, and computers getmore complex still, there will be fewer and fewer such people.andM;Jules May, among other things, teaches programming and computer animation toart students at a film school, few of whom are interested in logic ormachinery.andP;  Because of the advances in computers, the job gets harder everyterm (for him and for his students).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
