Following the diagnostic workup, 61 patientswere diagnosed as having possible, probable, or definite MS. The remaining39 were thought to have some other disease process, not MS. In these39 patients, MR detected abnormalities in 17. Because MR is highly sensitive,but not specific, positive findings on MR studies must be consideredcritically in patients with suspected MS. If the MR findings are notconsidered in conjunction with the neurologic examination and other diagnosticstudies, the incorrect diagnosis of MS may be made.</TEXT></DOC>
