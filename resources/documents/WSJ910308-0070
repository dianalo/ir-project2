An Iraqi T-72 tank materialized and cracked off a shot.The shell sliced into their Bradley Fighting Vehicle,shattering the inside of it and ripping into the fiveAmericans.</LP><TEXT>   The blast hit Pvt. Bradish in the groin and blew threefingers off his left hand. But he emerged from the smokingBradley lugging one of his buddies. Then he went back insidefor the others, pulling them out one by one and laying themon the sand a safe distance away.   He found a flare to call the medics, but he couldn't openit with his hands, so he bit off the top.   When other members of the Army unit came on the scene,Pvt. Bradish was back inside the Bradley, trying to drag outheavy belts of machine-gun bullets lest they explode andshoot up his mates. &quot;They had to pull him out of there,&quot; saysLt. Col. John Kalb, his commander. &quot;Only then did he lookdown and notice he was covered with blood.&quot;   Pvt. Bradish, a 21-year-old from Pocatello, Idaho, islisted in stable condition in a hospital in Germany.   Historians will remember the Gulf War as a rout won withhigh-technology weaponry that caused stunningly few alliedcasualties. Already there is a popular image of the war as aromp in which U.S. troops hardly broke a sweat as they sat intheir trenches, watched the air war from afar and thengreeted hordes of surrendering shell-shocked Iraqis.   But many of the U.S. soldiers, sailors, Marines and pilotswho were here will bring home memories of episodes of terrorand bravery. Navy Lt. Eddie Vince, 31, of New York City,battled surface-to-air missiles the size of telephone polesto drop bombs from his A-6 Intruder -- and then, on one run,lost an engine while returning to base. He had to land on anaircraft carrier at night with one engine -- something no onecan train for. He did it.   One morning at 4:30 a.m., an Iraqi mine blew an enormoushole in the keel of the USS Tripoli, throwing Lt. Cmdr. SteveSenk, 42, out of his bunk and slamming him into the wall.Water surged into the ship. The blast ruptured two tanks ofhelicopter fuel, and the oil was riding up on top of thewater. It also ripped open the ship's paint locker, andclouds of extremely flammable paint thinner were waftingthrough the ship. At that point a spark would have detonatedthe ship, which was carrying 1,375 Marines.   Cmdr. Senk, of San Diego, the ship's engineer, went downinto the fume-filled damaged area without an oxygen mask. Forfour hours, several times nearly overcome with paint fumes,he directed the effort to seal off the ship. The Tripoli sankthree feet lower in the water. But it stayed afloat. Later,while enjoying a cigar, Cmdr. Senk thought about what he hadjust gone through-and then his knees began to shake.   No one knows, going into battle, who will be a hero. InPocatello, Pvt. Bradish was always very quiet, an averagestudent and unspectacular member of the wrestling team. Infact, as a youngster in his own family, &quot;he was the leastnoticed of all the six kids,&quot; says a relative, Lyn Denham.   But there are two things everyone remembers about him.&quot;Frank was the type who knew he was going to be in themilitary from the time he could walk,&quot; says Sgt. First ClassWilliam Foster at the Pocatello recruiting office. He woremilitary fatigues to school for years, read a lot ofmagazines about Army gear and signed up in his senior year.He idolized his brother Bart, 22, a Marine with an amphibiousunit in the Persian Gulf.   The other remarkable thing about Pvt. Bradish: &quot;He wasfascinated by the mountain man, the Old West and the heroimage,&quot; says teacher Sally Lynne May, who says Pvt. Bradish&quot;loved&quot; her classes on the literature of the West and theAmerican Indian.   &quot;He liked people who did things on their own and withtheir own strength,&quot; she adds. &quot;He used to talk a lot aboutjoining the military. That was just about as close to the OldWest as he could get.&quot;   His father, Joseph, used to take his children hunting andfishing and &quot;he taught them survival,&quot; says Mrs. Denham.Eight years ago, Joseph Bradish was injured in an industrialaccident and has been institutionalized since with severebrain damage. Pvt. Bradish's mother, Rae, raised four boysand two girls on Social Security payments alone. &quot;It was ahard time,&quot; says his mother, but she says the children helpeda lot -- especially Frank, whom she calls &quot;one of the personsI depend on in my life.&quot;   The family grew up &quot;looking out for each other,&quot; she says,&quot;because of the tragedy of losing support.&quot;   Pvt. Bradish enlisted in February 1989, graduated in Juneand began basic training in August. Stationed thereafter inGermany, he was with the First Brigade of the Third ArmoredDivison, the storied &quot;Spearhead Division&quot; that led the Alliedcharge through Europe in World War II. He arrived in SaudiArabia in December 1990.   His unit was among those that conducted the vauntedwestern flanking maneuver that in three days went fromnorthern Saudia Arabia toward Basra, Iraq, to attack thewestern flank of the Republican Guard.   The fight came after a long day of maneuvering. The FirstBrigade of the Third Armored Division had been moving norththrough the Iraqi desert. Suddenly, there was a change ofplans and the division turned sharply eastward, headingtoward northern Kuwait, with the First Brigade out front. Itwas supposed to be chasing Iraq's 52nd Division.   The 52nd seemed to be a phantom outfit, moving backward soquickly that the Third Division tried twice that afternoon toset up its artillery, but each time it did the 52nd retreatedout of range. At dusk that day the sky toward the east wasvery black, with big thunderheads looming.   The spearhead of the brigade was Pvt. Bradish's unit --called the &quot;Red Lions Battalion.&quot; It was moving ahead towardthe darkness, feeling its way. The soldiers knew they werecoming toward the Republican Guard.   Pvt. Bradish had got his wish: He was performing thecavalry function for the First Brigade. In the Indian wars,the cavalrymen were the scouts, moving ahead of the main bodyof troops, trying to see where the enemy was. That is whatPvt. Bradish and the others in the Bradley Fighting Vehiclewere doing.   But somehow, in what proved to be a very black night, theyran into the T-72 tanks of the Republican Guard.   One of them fired at the Bradley from 200 yards --point-blank range for a tank -- before the Bradley could fireits wire-guided TOW missile. The tank shell pierced the thinaluminum hull of the Bradley. Pieces of it caromed around thecramped interior of the vehicle, causing mayhem among thecrew.   A second Bradley destroyed the enemy tank with a TOW.Soon, all hell broke loose all over the battlefield. ThirdDivision commanders called in A-10 bombers, Apachehelicopters, artillery and rocket launchers to rain fire onthe Iraqis. Even from two miles away, the result was afrightening light show.   Amid all havoc, Pvt. Bradish, who had turned 21 threeweeks before, was saving the lives of three of his buddies.The fourth died.   &quot;He cared about people,&quot; says his teacher, Mrs. May. &quot;I'mnot surprised he did these things. I always knew he was avery compassionate person.&quot;   Mrs. Denham, his relative, agrees. &quot;If he was almostdead,&quot; she says, &quot;he would have still pulled all of themout.&quot;   ---   Mark Anderson contributed to this story.</TEXT></DOC>
