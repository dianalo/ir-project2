The media concern had net income of $5.3 million, or 50cents a share, off from the year-earlier $5.6 million, or 54cents a share. Revenue fell to $104.1 million from $105.8million.</LP><TEXT>   A $3.9 million charge to write down good will and otherintangibles at the company's Lerner Newspapers unit trimmedper-share earnings by 35 cents in the latest quarter; thatwas largely offset by a tax-reserve adjustment, from afavorable tax ruling, which effectively added 34 cents ashare in the period.   The latest quarter also included about $700,000 inincentive and severance payments related to work forcereductions in the newspaper group, which trimmed pershareearnings by about two cents. For the year, such payments havetotaled $4.8 million.   Pulitzer said the company's &quot;emphasis on cost control,productivity and debt reduction served us well in a year inwhich advertising demand continued to be very disappointing.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
