(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   British nobility joined American cowboys andother Northern Plains states descendants Saturday to dedicate FortUnion, once the frontier's fur trading headquarters, and to marktwo neighboring states' centennials.   The fort _ which played host to visitors ranging from PrinceMaximilian of Germany to naturalist James J. Audubon in the 1800s _has been rebuilt to highlight the centennials of North Dakota andneighboring Montana.   An estimated 15,000 people were expected to attend the two-daydedication of the four-year, multimillion-dollar restorationproject by the National Park Service.   ``The National Park Service and everyone else associated with itshould be proud of their effort,'' said Lord John Jacob Astor VIII,a direct descendant of John Jacob Astor, the founder of thepowerful American Fur Trading Co. that built Fort Union in 1829.   Located near the North Dakota-Montana border at the confluenceof the Yellowstone and Missouri rivers, Fort Union was aheadquarters for fur traders and Indians of the mid-1800s.   The area now is dominated by hulking oil rigs, farms andranches. A few buffalo also can be found, remnants of the herdsthat once roamed the prairie.   ``This is a piece of American history,'' said Peter Abram, avacationing Barrie, Ontario, resident who toured the fort Saturdaywith his wife, Irma. ``It's hard not to think of the poor buggerswho built this originally, the hardships they endured.''   Fort Union dominated the economy of the Northern Plains untilthe Army dismantled it more than a century ago when the AmericanFur Trading Co. went out of business.   The Army used some of the doors, windows and wood from thecivilian fort to build its Fort Buford just east of the tradingpost.   Nothing was left of the original trading post and reconstructiondepended on diaries, paintings and photographs for design anddetail, said Paul Hedren, superintendent of the 430-acre park.   ``We've been faithful to the fort's original design as much aspossible,'' Hedren said. ``The fort you see today, we feel, is whatfur traders on the Missouri saw in the mid-1800s.''   The centerpiece of the fort is the colorful Bourgeois House.Finished in 1987, it now contains museum exhibits andadministrative offices.   The whitewashed walls of the fort began going up this pastspring and were completed just in time for the dedication. Twobastions housing cannons sit at two corners of the facility.   Modern-day ``buckskinners'' dressed in clothing of the periodrelived the past Saturday by peddling buffalo hides, beaver peltsand beadwork at a tepee encampment near the fort.   Joining in the festivities was a contingent of Royal CanadianMounted Police officers from Manitoba and Saskatchewan who appearedin the distinctive garb of their 1870s predecessors.   ``I'm a history nut, a buckskin nut, an Indian nut,'' said JimBill Henderson of Jefferson City, Mo., who took part in ``livinghistory'' activities at the fort Saturday.   Henderson, a Teddy Roosevelt look-alike who is working thissummer at Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, attended the dedicationin a replica of the uniform Roosevelt wore in the Spanish-AmericanWar.   Nearly $4 million has gone into the reconstruction of the fort.About $3.3 million came from the federal government and about$500,000 was provided by local supporters called Friends of FortUnion.</TEXT></DOC>
