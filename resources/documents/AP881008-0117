(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democratic vice presidential candidateLloyd Bentsen promised Saturday to make George Bush ``face themusic'' for choosing Dan Quayle for the Republican ticket.   Bentsen, contending his debate with the Indiana senatorWednesday night was ``the turning point'' for the Democrats, saidat a Houston news conference that ``the Republicans have now triedto turn the subject away from the debate, to not talk about DanQuayle.''   ``In fact, I'm beginning to wonder, where is Dan Quayle? Did heleave a forwarding address when he left Omaha?'' asked Sen.Bentsen, who was wrapping up a three-day swing through his homestate on Saturday.   Later in the day, making a quick trip to the Navajo Nation inneighboring New Mexico, Bentsen continued to brag about his debateperformance.   ``Dan Quayle has a different perspective than he had lastWednesday night,'' he said.   Bentsen, with Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., stood waving on thetailgate of a Secret Service van as he rode into Shiprock along atwo and one-half mile parade route for the town's 65th annual fair.Tens of thousands of people were there for the parade, and some ranup to grab Bentsen's hand when they found out who he was.   He watched an Indian dance demonstration and met with triballeaders. He told the crowd that the Democrats stood for more andbetter rural health, education and development programs, and thatthe Republicans had cut such programs back.   The Democrats are hoping a strong vote from the reservationswill help them win New Mexico in November.   From New Mexico, Bentsen was returning to Texas to end his tripwith a pair of appearances in El Paso, on the far western end ofthe state.   ``George Bush may try to run away from his running mate, but hereally can't hide,'' Bentsen said at his Houston news conference.   ``While the Republicans are running from the issues, and runningfrom Dan Quayle, we don't intend to let them change the tune; we'regoing to see that they face the music,'' Bentsen said.   Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis has been facingthe music in Texas on the issues of crime and gun control in abarrage of Republican ads portraying him as a coddler of criminalswho wants to disarm honest citizens. Bentsen attacked what he saidwere distortions of Dukakis' record, and said Texas would seethrough them.   ``Texans won't buy a bill of goods on gun control from a man whowanted to sell Hawk missiles to the ayatollah,'' he said.   Bentsen denied Republican assertions that the Democrats hadgiven up on winning the South.   ``That is obviously not true. It sounds like some of hiscomments during the debate. Not true at all,'' he said.   ``I was in North Carolina the other day and they tell me we'reahead there. I was in Tennessee, they said that's a dead heat. Ithink we're ahead in Arkansas. We've seen a nice improvement herein Texas (where) the momentum is back in our direction,'' he said,citing a recent poll showing the ticket only five points behind.   Bentsen also discussed his relationship with the late PresidentJohn F. Kennedy, which some have questioned since Bentsen said thatthey were friends. He said that during the debate just beforetelling Quayle he was ``no Jack Kennedy.''   Bentsen, who served in the House with Kennedy, said he was theMassachusetts senator's finance chairman in Houston when Kennedyran for president. He also said he received from Kennedy aninscribed copy of his Pulitzer Prize-winning book, ``Profiles inCourage.''   Kennedy invited him to his wedding, Bentsen said, but he wasalready scheduled to make a speech in south Texas and missed it.   ``If I had known he was going to be president, I'd have gone,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
