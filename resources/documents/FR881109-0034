Theestimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice. We also preliminarily determine that critical circumstancesexist with respect to imports of certain classes or kinds of AFBs fromJapan, as outlined in the ``Critical Circumstances'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since the notice of initiation (53 FR 15076, April 27, 1988), the followingevents have occurred. On May 17, 1988, the ITC determined that there isreasonable indication that U.S. industries are materially injured by reasonof imports of the subject merchandise from Japan (53 FR 18909, May 25,1988). On May 31, 1988, the Department presented Section A of the antidumpingduty questionnaires to Koyo Seiko Co., Ltd. (Koyo); Minebea Co., Ltd. (Minebea);Nachi-Fujikoshi Corp. (Nachi); Nippon Seiko K.K. (NSK); and NTN Toyo Bearing,Co., Ltd. (NTN). These companies account for a substantial portion of exportsof the subject merchandise from Japan to the United States during the periodof investigation. The remaining sections of the questionnaire were issuedon June 15, 1988. Responses to Section A were due on June 14, 1988, andresponses to the remaining sections were due on July 15, 1988. On July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandum stating that the subjectmerchandise constitutes five classes or kinds of merchandise (<T3>see</T3>, ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice.)In light of this decision, the Department re-examined the sufficiency ofpetitioner's less than fair value (LTFV) allegations for each class orkind of merchandise from Japan. the Department afforded petitioner an opportunityto provide additional information in support of its LTFV allegations forparticular classes or kinds of merchandise where needed. On August 1, 2,and 29, 1988, petitioner submitted additional data. We determined thatpetitioner provided sufficient information in support of the LTFV allegationsfor each class or kind of merchandise from Japan. On July 15, 1988, the Department determined that these investigations areextraordinarily complicated in accordance with section 733(c)(1)(B)(i)of the Act, and postponed the preliminary determinations until no laterthan October 27, 1988 (53 FR 27738, July 22, 1988). On August 8, 1988, we issued revised reporting requirements based on ourdecision to simplify these investigations (<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Accordingly, response deadlines were extended several times, with the finaldue date for response being no later than September 6, 1988. A number ofsupplemental questionnaires were issued subsequent to that date. Supplementalresponses were received from the respondents prior to these preliminarydeterminations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>During the period April 27 through September 29, 1988, we received numeroussubmissions from parties challenging The Torrington Company's standingto file the petition and requesting dismissal of the petition on the groundsthat it was not filed by ``an interested party'' ``on behalf of'' the UnitedStates industry as required by section 732(b)(1) of the Act. Section 771(9)(c)of the Act defines ``interested party'' to include ``a manufacturer, producer,or wholesaler in the United States of a like product.'' With the exceptionof an additional category for ``other antifriction devices,'' the ITC categorizationof the subject merchandise into six like products is identical to the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise subject to these investigations. Torringtonhas demonstrated that it produces all five classes or kinds of the subjectmerchandise. Therefore, Torrington is a manufacturer, producer or wholesalerin the United States of the like products under investigation, and is an``interested party'' with standing to file this petition. The statutory provision that governs the standing of parties to bring petitionsrequires the commencement of an investigation ``whenever an interestedparty * * * files a petition * * * on behalf of an industry.'' Section732(b)(1) of the Act. As we have stated in prior cases (<T3>see, e.g., Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination; CertainStainless Steel Hollow Products from Sweden</T3> (52 FR 5794, February28, 1987) and <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations; Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Malaysia</T3> (50 FR 9852, March 12, 1985),the Department relies upon the petitioner's representations that it hasfiled ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry until it is shown that a majorityof the domestic industry affirmatively opposes the peition. The Departmentbases this position on the fact that neither the Act nor its legislativehistory restricts access to the unfair trade laws by requiring that partiespetitioning for relief under these laws establish affirmatively that amajority of the members of the relevant industry support the petition.The only requirement is that the party filing the petition act as the representativeof the domestic industry. When a member of the domestic industry challenges the assertion of thepetitioner that it has filed ``on behalf of'' the domestic industry, theburden is on the opponent to establish that the petitioner does not havethe support of a majority of the domestic industry. To meet this requirement,the opponent must provide evidence that at least a majority of the domesticindustry affirmatively opposes the petition. Where domestic industry members opposing a petition provide a clear indicationthat there are grounds to doubt a petitioner's standing, the Departmentwill evaluate the opposition to determine whether the opposing partiesdo, in fact, represent a major proportion of the domestic industry.In order to determine whether a major proportion of the domestic industryopposes the petition, on October 14, 1988, we issued a questionnaire tothose parties challenging the standing of The Torrington Company. Responsesto the standing questionnaires are due on October 28, 1988. We will continueto examine the standing issue for purposes of the final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules will be fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule</T3> (HTS) and all the merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date willbe classified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Untilthat time, however, the Department will be providing both the appropriate<T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3> (TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions. aswith the TSUSA, the HTS item numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The Department's written description of the products under investigationremains dispositive as to the scope of the product coverage.We are requesting petitioners to include the appropriate HTS item number(s)as well as the TSUSA item number(s) in all petitions filed with the Departmentthrough the end of this year. A reference copy of the HTS is availablefor consultation in the Central Records Unit, Room B-099, U.S. Departmentof Commerce, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.Additionally, all U.S. Customs offices have reference copies, and petitionersmay contact the import specialist at their local Customs office to consultthe schedule.For a complete description of the products subject to these investigations,see Appendix I attached to this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise</ITAG>In our notice of initiation (53 Fr 15076, April 27, 1988), we treated thesubject merchandise as one ``class or kind of merchandise.'' Subsequentto initiation, we receive numerous comments from petitioner, respondents,and other interested parties in these investigations on whether the subjectmerchandise constitutes one or more classes or kinds of merchandise. Aftercareful consideration of all views expressed, and based on our discussionswith product experts at the U.S. Customs Service, the ITC, and within theDepartment, we issued a decision memorandum on July 13, 1988, stating thatthe subject merchandise constitutes five separate classes or kinds of merchandise,as follows:1. Ball Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (Ball Bearings).2. Spherical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (SphericalRoller Bearings).3. Cylindrical Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, an Parts Thereof(Cylindrical Roller Bearings).4. Needle Roller Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, and Parts Thereof (NeedleRoller Bearings).5. Plain Bearings, Mounted or Unmounted, an Parts Thereof (Plain Bearings).This July 13, 1988 decision memorandum is on file in the Central RecordsUnit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Alternative Reporting Requirements</ITAG>Pursuant to 19 CFR 353.38, the Department ``normally will examine at least60 percent of the dollar volume of exports to the United States from anycountry subject to an antidumping investigation.'' Due to the enormousvolume of sales by respondents during the period of investigation and thecomplexity of identifying similar merchandise, we have attempted to reducethe reporting requirements for respondents while maintaining a reasonablebasis for our analysis. Accordingly, on July 15, 1988, we issued a letterto all interested parties requesting comments on two alternatives to ourstandard methodology. One alternative was to select at random a certainnumber of products sold in the United States and to compare the U.S. pricesfor those products with the home market prices of identical or similarmerchandise, as appropriate.The second alternative was as follows: if at least 33 percent by volumeof the respondent's U.S. sales could be compared to home market sales ofidentical products, then fair value comparisons would be limited to identicalcomparisons. If a respondent failed to reach the 33 percent requirementwith identical matches, then, in addition to identical comparisons, wewould compare the largest volume products sold in the United States tosimilar products sold in the home market within each class or kind categoryuntil the 33 percent threshold was met.After reviewing comments from interested parties on this issue, we selectedthe second alternative. The August 5, 1988 memorandum explaining the proceduresoutlined above is on file in the Central Records Unit.<ITAG tagnum="84">Cost of Production Allegations</ITAG>Based on information presented in the petition and supplemental submissions,on April 20, 1988, we initiated an investigation of sales at LTFV fromJapan. At that time, we also initiated an investigation of whether salesin the home market were being made at prices below the cost of production(COP). As stated above, on July 13, 1988, we issued a decision memorandumstating that the products under investigation constitute five separateclasses or kinds of merchandise. (<T3>See,</T3> ``Class or Kind of Merchandise'' section of this notice.)Accordingly, on July 22, 1988, the Department requested that petitionersubmit evidence of sales at below the COP for each class or kind of merchandiseunder investigation for which sufficient information had not been provided.In addition, several respondents objected to the Department's decisionto initiate COP investigations. Citing <T3>Al Tech Specialty Steel Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States,</T3> 575 F. Supp. 1277 (CIT 1983) (<T3>Al Tech</T3>), these respondents argued that petitioner's sales belowcost allegations were deficient because they were based on country-wide,rather than company-specific home market pricing data. After review ofthese comments, the <T3>Al Tech</T3> decision, and Section 773(b), on August 22, 1988, we discontinuedthe COP investigations, but allowed petitioner additional time to submitcompany-specific home market price information to substantiate its allegationsof sales at below the COP. The August 22, 1988 decision memorandum outliningour analysis of this issue is on file in the Central Records Unit. Petitionersubmitted such new allegations of home market sales below the COP.After analyzing petitioner's new allegations and the numerous supplementsthereto, we have determined that sufficient company-specific allegationshave been provided with respect to the following:I. Ball BearingsA. Koyo.B. Nachi.C. NSK.D. NTN.II. Spherical Roller BearingsA. Koyo.B. Nachi.C. NSK.D. NTN.III. Cylindrical Roller BearingsA. NSK.B. NTN.IV. Needle Roller BearingsA. NTN.Therefore, the Department has reinstated COP investigations for these companieson the classes or kinds of AFBs listed above. <ITAG tagnum="84">Voluntary Respondents</ITAG>On July 15, 1988, we issued questionnaires to four companies which hadexpressed an interest in submitting a voluntary responses in these investigations.However, we received no voluntary responses, and none has been consideredfor the purposes of these investigations.<ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation</ITAG>The period of investigation is October 1, 1987 through March 31, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="84">Such or Similar Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether there are sufficient sales of the subject merchandisein the home market to serve as the basis for calculating foreign marketvalue, we normally compare the volume of home market sales to the volumeof sales to third countries within each respective such or similar category.In developing criteria for such or similar comparisons, we reviewed thematching criteria for such or similar comparisons, we reviewed the matchingcriteria set forth in <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished and Unfinished, from Japan </T3>(52FR 30790, August 17, 1987). In addition, we sought and considered commentsfrom interested parties and consulted product experts at the U.S. CustomsService, the ITC, and the Department. Given the enormous number of productssold and the numerous physical permutations among bearing types, it wouldhave been virtually impossible to determine home market viability basedon such or similar categories within each class or kind of merchandise.Therefore, home market viability was calculated based on home market andthird country sales of each class or kind of merchandise.Pursuant to our alternative reporting requirements, where 33 percent ormore of U.S. sales by volume were identical in all physical respects tohome markets products, comparisons of similar merchandise were unnecessary(<T3>see, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).In those instances where similar comparisons were necessary for a givenclass or kind of merchandise, we instructed respondents first to narrowthe pool of possible product comparisons by matching each of the followingcriteria: (1) Number of rows of rolling elements, (2) load direction, (3)bearing design, and (4) precision rating. Respondents were then to applya ten percent deviation test to each bearing in this pool of possible productcomparisons based on the (a) outside diameter, (b) inside diameter, (c)width, and (d) dynamic load rating to determine the most similar home marketcomparison.<ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons</ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from Japan to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. In accordance withsection 776(c) of the Act, where a company has failed to respond to ourquestionnaire, has submitted a response which we consider to be substantiallydeficient, or has submitted information too late to be considered for purposesof these preliminary determinations, we relied on best information available.Those instances where we used best information available are fully describedbelow.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>For those sales made directly to unrelated parties prior to importationinto the United States, we based the United States price on purchase price,in accordance with section 772(b) of the Act.In those cases where sales were made through a related sales agent in theUnited States to an unrelated purchaser prior to the date of importation,we also used purchase price as the basis for determining United Statesprice. For these sales, the Department determined that purchase price wasthe most appropriate determinant of United States price based on the followingelements:1. The merchandise in question was shipped directly from the manufacturerto the unrelated buyer, without being introduced into the inventory ofa related selling agent;2. This was a customary commercial channel for sales of this merchandisebetween the parties involved; and3. The related selling agent located in the United States acted only asa processor of sales-related documentation and a communication link withthe unrelated U.S. buyer.Where all the above elements are met, we regard the routine selling functionsof the exporter as merely having been relocated geographically from thecountry of exportation to the United States, where the sales agent performsthem. Whether these functions take place in the United States or abroaddoes not change the substance of the transactions or the functions themselves.Where the sale to the first unrelated purchaser took place after importationinto the United States, we based United States price on exporter's salesprice (ESP), in accordance with section 772(c) of the Act.The calculation of United States price for each class or kind of merchandisefor each respondent is detailed below.I. Ball BearingsA. <T3>Koyo: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent (<T3>see, </T3>``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice),Koyo has to report both identical and similar home market matches and constructedvalue for certain products with no home market matches. However, for certainU.S. sales, it made comparisons to identical or similar home market productswhich were only sold to related parties in the home market. Since Koyohad no sales of these products to unrelated parties in Japan (<T3>see </T3>discussion of sales to related and unrelated parties in the``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice), and did not provide constructedvalue information in sufficient time to analyze for these preliminary determinations,we had to use best information available to calculate the margins for thoseU.S. sales. As best information available, we used the highest margin allegedin the petition for this class or kind of merchandise.For those U.S. sales where we had identical or similar home market salesto unrelated parties, we calculated ESP based on the packed, c.i.f. anddelivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We made deductionsfrom USP, where appropriate, for foreign inland freight, export brokerage,ocean freight, marine insurance, import brokerage, U.S. duty, and U.S.inland freight, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We alsomade deductions, where appropriate, for discounts and rebates. We madefurther deductions, where appropriate, for commissions, credit expenses,inspection fees, quality control expenses, repackaging in the U.S., warranties,and all indirect selling expenses pursuant to section 772(e) (1) and (2)of the Act.Koyo incorrectly allocated certain movement charges on the basis of salesvalue, rather than weight. For the preliminary determinations, we are usingthe reported charges as best information available.Because the quantity of the subject merchandise sold as purchase pricesales constituted a minimal percentage of Koyo's total sales to the UnitedStates, we are disregarding these sales for purposes of these determinations.To calculate the estimated weighted-average margin listed in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice, we weighted the margin calculatedusing Koyo's home market sales to unrelated parties with the margin allegedby petitioner until we reached 33 percent coverage of U.S. sales by volume.B. <T3>Minebea: </T3>Because Minebea failed to submit a response with respectto ball bearings, we used best information available in accordance withsection 776(c) of the Act. For purposes of these preliminary determinations,best information available is the highest rate alleged in the petitionfor ball bearings from Japan.c. <T3>Nachi: </T3>Nachi reported that more than 33 percent by volume of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market (<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated purchase price and ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. We madedeductions from purchase price and ESP, where appropriate, for foreigninland freight (which included inland insurance), export brokerage (whichincluded containerization), ocean freight, air freight, marine and airinsurance, import brokerage, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland freight (whichincluded inland insurance), in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of theAct. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts. We madefurther deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for credit expenses, advertising,inspection fees, commissions, technical services (expenses incurred intesting bearings), and all indirect selling expenses, pursuant to section772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act.D. <T3>NSK: </T3>NSK reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market (<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice).Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matchesin our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forforeign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, export brokerage, oceanfreight, marine insurance, U.S. brokerage, U.S. duty, and U.S. inland frieght,in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We also made deductions,where appropriate, for discounts and rebates. We made further deductions,where appropriate, for credit expenses, inspection fees, and all indirectselling expenses, pursuant to section 772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act.NSK omitted its product liability premium expenses for U.S. sales on thecomputer tape used for these preliminary determinations. Based on informationcontained in a revised narrative response, we included this expense inour calculation of U.S. price. for certain of its sales, NSK failed toreport inventory carrying costs. Where this expense was omitted, we calculatedinventory carrying costs based on the other information in the response.NSK incorrectly reported charges incurred in yen by converting these chargesto U.S. dollar amounts. Certain movement charges were also incorrectlyallocated on the basis of sales values, rather than weight. For the preliminarydeterminations, we are using the reported charges as best information available.Because the quantity of the subject merchandise sold as purchase pricesales constituted a minimal percentage of NSK's total sales to the UnitedStates, we are disregarding these sales for purposes of these determinations.E. <T3>NTN: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent (<T3>see</T3>, ``Alternative Reporting Requirements'' section of this notice),NTN had to report both identical and similar home market matches whichwe used in our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate,for foreign inland freight, foreign inland insurance, brokerage and handling,ocean freight, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight, and U.S.inland insurance, in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act. We madefurther deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for credit expenses, inspectionfees, commissions, and all indirect selling expenses pursuant to sections772(e) (1) and (2) of the Act.NTN omitted the Japan Bearing Inspection Fee from the sales tape used forthese preliminary determinations. Based on information submitted in a narrativeresponse, we have included that expense in our calculation of U.S. price.NTN also failed to report an amount for U.S. duty on certain sales; forsuch sales we have calculated an amount for U.S. duty.NTN incorrectly reported charges incurred in yen by converting these chargesinto U.S. dollar amounts. Certain movement charges were also incorrectlyallocated on the basis of sales value, rather than weight. For these preliminarydeterminations, we are using the reported charges as best information available.Because the quantity of the subject merchandise sold as purchase pricesales constituted a minimal percentage of NSK's total sales to the UnitedStates, we are disregarding these sales for purposes of these determinations.II. Spherical Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo: </T3>With respect to the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, Koyo reported U.S. sales with identical home market matches. However,as described above for ball bearings, certain of the home market productswere sold only to related parties. Therefore, as described above for ballbearings, we had to use both best information available and price-to-pricecomparisons for purposes of calculating the estimated weighted-averagemargin.For the U.S. sales used in price-to-price comparisons, we calculated ESPbased on the packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings.B. <T3>Nachi: </T3>Nachi reported that more than 33 percent by volume of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Thereforewe have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons.We calculated purchase price and ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., c.i.f.,and delivered prices to unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustmentswere identical to those described above for ball bearings.C. <T3>NSK: </T3>In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, NSK reported identical home market matches. However, for certainU.S. sales, it made comparisons to identical home market product whichwere only sold to related parties in the home market. Since NSK reportedno sales of these products to unrelated parties in Japan (<T3>see</T3> discussion of sales to related and unrelated parties in the``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice), we had to use best informationavailable to calculate the margins for those U.S. sales. As best informationavailable, we used the highest margin alleged in the petition for sphericalroller bearings.For those U.S. sales where we had identical home market sales to unrelatedparties, we calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings.To calculate the estimated weighted-average margin listed in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice, we weighted the margin calculatedusing NSK's home market sales to unrelated parties with the margin usingdata alleged by petitioner until we reached 33 percent coverage of U.S.sales by volume.D. <T3>NTN: </T3>NTN reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings.III. Cylindrical Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo: </T3>With respect to the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, Koyo had to report both identical and similar home market matches.With respect to these home market sales, the same circumstances exist forcylindrical roller bearings as for ball bearings described above. Therefore,as described above for ball bearings, we had to use both best informationavailable and price-to-price comparisons for purposes of calculating theestimated weighted dumping margin. For best information available, we usedthe margin calculated in the price-to-price comparisons since this marginwas higher than the margin alleged in the petition.We calculated ESP based on the packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices tounrelated customers in the United States. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>Nachi: </T3>Nachi reported that more than 33 percent by volume of itsU.S. sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Thereforewe have used all U.S. sales with identical home market matches in our price-to-pricecomparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., c.i.f., and delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the United States. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings, except that there were no purchaseprice sales of cylindrical roller bearings.C. <T3>NSK: </T3>NSK reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used these sales in our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings.D. <T3>NTN:</T3> NTN reported that more than 33 percent by volume of its U.S.sales were identical to products sold in the home market. Therefore, wehave used these sales in our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball barings.Because of the quantity of the subject merchandise sold as purchase pricesales constituted a minimal percentage of NTN's total sales to the UnitedStates, we are disregarding these sales for purpose of these determinations.IV. Needle Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo:</T3> With respect to the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, Koyo reported U.S. sales with identical home market matches. However,as described above for ball bearings, certain of the home market productswere sold only to related parties (<T3>see</T3> discussion of sales to related and unrelated parties in the``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice). In addition, Koyo reportedthat there were no similar home market matches for a significant percentageof U.S. sales, nor did Koyo provide constructed value information in sufficienttime to be analyzed for these preliminary determinations. Therefore, asdescribed above for ball bearings, we had to use both best informationavailable and price-to-price comparisons for purposes of calculating theestimated weighted-average dumping margin.For the sales used in our price-to-price comparisons, we calculated ESPbased on the packed, c.i.f., and delivered prices to unrelated customersin the United States. The adjustments were identical to those describedabove for ball bearings.B. <T3>NTN:</T3> In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of 33percent, NTN had to report both identical and similar home market matcheswhich we used in our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b., and delivered price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings. We also used purchase price sales inour calculation of U.S. price since the volume of such sales were a significantamount of total U.S. sales of needle roller bearings. We calculated purchaseprice based on the packed, f.o.b., Japanese warehouse price to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. We made deductions from purchase price,where appropriate, for foreign inland freight and foreign inland insurance,in accordance with section 772(d)(2) of the Act.V. Plain BearingsA. <T3>Minebea:</T3> In order to meet the minimum reporting requirement of33 percent, Minebea had to report both identical and similar home marketmatches. However, in the response submitted on September 6, 1988, Minebeafailed to follow the instructions outlined in the questionnaire to makeits selection of most similar home market comparisons to U.S. sales (<T3> see</T3>, ``Such or Similar Comparisons'' section of this notice).In the amended response submitted on October 7, 1988, Minebea correctedits product matches. However, because this information was submitted solate in these investigations, it was not possible to fully analyze theOctober 7, 1988 narrative responses and the information provided on computertape for purposes of these preliminary determinations. Therefore, for thoseU.S. sales involving similar matches, we have used, as best informationavailable in accordance with section 776(c) of the Act, the highest marginalleged in the petition for plain bearings from Japan.For the U.S. sales with identical home market matches, we based our analysison price-to-price comparisons. For these sales, we calculated ESP basedon the packed, f.o.b. U.S. shipping point prices to unrelated customersin the United States. We made deductions from ESP, where appropriate, forfreight forwarding expenses, marine insurance, U.S. duty, U.S. inland freight,and U.S. brokerage and handling expenses, in accordance with section 772(d)(2)of the Act. We also made deductions, where appropriate, for discounts.We made further deductions from ESP, where appropriate, for advertising,U.S. credit expenses, technical service expenses, warranty expenses, andall indirect selling expenses pursuant to sections 772(e) (1) and (2) ofthe Act.The narrative response submitted on October 7, 1988, contained revisedinformation on discounts, freight forwarding expenses, inventory carryingcosts, home market credit expenses, and new information on U.S. indirectselling expenses incurred in Japan. As stated above, the October 7, 1988computer tapes were not submitted in time to be used for purposes of thesepreliminary determinations; however, based on the narrative response, weincorporated the new and revised information on certain charges and adjustmentswherever possible for purposes of our analysis.To calculate the estimated weighted-average margin listed in the ``Suspensionof Liquidation'' section of this notice, we weighted the margin calculatedusing Minebea's sales information with the margin using data alleged bypetitioner until we reached 33 percent coverage of U.S. sales by volume.B. <T3>NTN:</T3> For plain bearings, NTN reported that more than 33 percentby volume of its U.S. sales were identical to products sole in the homemarket. Therefore, we have used all U.S. sales with home market identicalmatches in our price-to-price comparisons.We calculated ESP based on the packed, f.o.b. and delivered prices to unrelatedcustomers in the United States. The adjustments were identical to thosedescribed above for ball bearings.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value</ITAG>In accordance with section 773(a) of the Act, we calculated foreign marketvalue based on home market sales to unrelated parties and, where necessary,best information available. The calculation of foreign market value foreach respondent is detailed below.Koyo, Nachi, NSK, and NTN have reported sales to both unrelated and relatedparties in the home market in making comparisons to U.S. sales. Nachi wasthe only respondent to notify the Department of its intent to report bothunrelated and related party sales and to request that the Department usethe related sales in making fair value comparisons. We informed Nachi that,if they chose to report related party sales, such sales would be used indetermining foreign market value only if we were satisfied that ``suchsales are demonstrated * * * to be at prices comparable to those at whichsuch or similar merchandise is sold to persons unrelated to the seller,''pursuant to 19 CFR 353.22(b). Furthermore, we informed Nachi that, wherehome market sales of a comparison product were made only to related parties,the first sale to an unrelated party in the home market had to be reported.We first learned that Koyo, NSK, and NTN were reporting related party saleswhen they filed their responses to Section B of our questionnaire. In supplementalquestionnaries, we issued the same instructions to these companies as weissued to Nachi.Nachi, NSK, and NTN have argued that sales to related parties are madeat arm's length and that the prices charged to related parties are comparableto those charged to unrelated parties. Koyo has implicitly made this argumentsince, in its response, Koyo compared U.S. products to the identical orsimilar products sold in the home market only to related parties. Noneof the companies, except Nachi, has submitted detailed analyses, on a product-by-productbasis, comparing prices (less discounts, rebates, and credit expenses)of bearings sold in the home market to both related and unrelated parties.Nachi's submission analyzing this issue was received on October 24, 1988,too late to be used for these preliminary determinations. Therefore, forall respondents, we have used only sales in the home market to unrelatedparties for the purposes of determining foreign market value.I. Ball Bearings.A. <T3>Koyo: </T3>For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight and home marketpacking. Since U.S. price is based on ESP, we made further deductions fromhome market price, were appropriate, for home market credit expenses, warranties,and commissions, and we made an adjustment to the home market price forindirect selling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). We addedU.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1)of the Act. We made further adjustments, where applicable, to the homemarket price to account for differences in the physical characteristicsof the merchandise, in accordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.Koyo claimed rebates paid on home market sales as a direct selling expense;however, Koyo allocated the rebates over all home market sales. Since therebates were allocated over all sales rather than just those sales on whichthe rebates were paid, we are treating the rebates as indirect sellingexpenses.Koyo also incorrectly allocated inland freight by sales value rather thanby weight. For the preliminary determinations, we are using the reportedcharges as best information available.B. <T3>Minebea: </T3>As described in the ``United States Price'' section ofthis notice, we used best information available in accordance with section776(c) of the Act as the basis for our preliminary determination with respectto ball bearings.C. <T3>Nachi</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for rebates, inland freight, andhome market packing. We added U.S. packing to the home market price, inaccordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act.For comparisons involving purchase price sales, we made adjustments tothe home market price, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses,inspection fees, technical services, and advertising, pursuant to 19 CFR353.15. For comparisons involving ESP transactions, we made further deductionsfrom the home market price, where appropriate, for home market credit expenses,technical services (expenses incurred in testing bearings), and advertising,and we made an adjustment to the home market price for indirect sellingexpenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). Since all home market productsused in fair value comparisons are identical to the products sold in theUnited States, no adjustments for physical differences in merchandise wererequired.Nachi made a claim that it incurred direct advertising expenses on itssales to original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). We are treating theseexpenses as indirect selling expenses since Nachi did not provide sufficientinformation to demonstrate that the advertising in question is directedto the OEMs' customers.Nachi claimed personnel expenses incurred when rendering technical servicesas a direct selling expense. Employee salaries are nonvariable expensesand, as such, are not allowable as direct selling expenses. Therefore,we have treated these personnel expenses as indirect selling expenses.Nachi made a claim for warehousing expenses. We are treating these expensesas indirect selling expenses rather than as direct expenses since the warehousingexpenses were incurred before the date of sale reported by Nachi in itsresponses.Nachi also claimed an adjustment for exchange gains or losses on certainpurchase price sales. For the preliminary determinations, we are not allowingthis adjustment since it appears that the dollar price charged to the U.S.customer under a dollar-denominated contract is not affected. Based onthe responses, it appears that only the amount of yen received by Nachion the sale may change.D. <T3>NSK</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight, inland insurance,and home market packing. Since U.S. price is based on ESP, we made furtherdeductions from home market price, where appropriate, for home market creditexpenses and commissions, and we made an adjustment to the home marketprice for indirect selling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c).We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act. Since all home market products used in fair valuecomparisons are identical to the products sold in the United States, noadjustments for physical differences in merchandise were required.NSK claimed rebates and discounts paid on home market sales as a directselling expense; however, NSK allocated the rebates and discounts overall home market sales. Since these were allocated over all sales ratherthan only those sales on which the rebates and discounts were incurred,we are treating the rebates and discounts as indirect selling expenses.NSK also incorrectly allocated inland freight by sales value rather thanby weight. For the preliminary determinations, we are using the reportedcharges as best information available.E. <T3>NTN</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions from thehome market price, where appropriate, for discounts, inland freight andinsurance, and home market packing. Since U.S. price is based on ESP, wemade further deductions from the home market price, where appropriate,for home market credit expenses, commissions, and royalty expenses, andwe made an adjustment to the home market price for indirect selling expenses,in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c). We added U.S. packing to the homemarket price, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act. We madefurther adjustments to the home market price, where applicable, to accountfor differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandise, inaccordance with section 773(a)(4)(C) of the Act.NTN incorrectly allocated inland freight by sales value rather than byweight. For these preliminary determinations, we are using the reportedcharges as best information available.NTN made a claim for warehousing expenses. We are treating these expensesas indirect selling expenses rather than as direct expenses since the warehousingexpenses were incurred before the date of sale reported by NTN in its response.II. Spherical Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings except that no adjustment wasmade for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandisesince we used only identical product comparisons.B. <T3>Nachi</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings.C. <T3>NSK</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings.D. <T3>NTN</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings except that no adjustment wasmade for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandisesince we used only identical product comparisons.III. Cylindrical Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings.B. <T3>Nachi</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings when foreign market value wascompared to ESP. There were no comparisons to purchase price because therewere no purchase price sales of cylindrical roller bearings.C. <T3>NSK</T3>: For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were indenticalto those described above for ball bearings.D. <T3>NTN. </T3>For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings except that no adjustment wasmade for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandisesince we used only identical product comparisons.IV. Needle Roller BearingsA. <T3>Koyo: </T3>For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings except that no adjustment wasmade for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandisesince we used only identical product comparisons.B. <T3>NTN: </T3>For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings except that for comparisonsinvolving purchase price sales, we made adjustments to the home marketprice, where appropriate, for differences in credit expenses and inspectionfees, pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15.We did not make an adjustment for home market commissions when comparingforeign market value to purchase price sales. NTN did not provide indirectselling expenses incurred on purchase price sales and, therefore, no adjustmentcould be made pursuant to 19 CFR 353.15(c).V. Plain BearingsA. <T3>Minebea: </T3>For those home market sales used in our price-to-pricecomparisons, we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, deliveredprices to unrelated customers in the home market. We made deductions fromhome market price, where appropriate, for inland freight and home marketpacking.We made further deductions from home market price, where appropriate, forhome market credit expenses, and we made an adjustment to the home marketprice for indirect selling expenses, in accordance with 19 CFR 353.15(c).We added U.S. packing to the home market price, in accordance with section773(a)(1) of the Act.For purposes of these preliminary determinations, we have treated the advertisingexpense as an indirect expense in the home market, as respondent did notprovide sufficient information to demonstrate that the expense is a directselling expense incurred on behalf of its customer's customers.B. <T3>NTN:</T3> For those home market sales used in price-to-price comparisons,we calculated foreign market value based on the packed, delivered pricesto unrelated customers in the home market. The adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings except that no adjustment wasmade for differences in the physical characteristics of the merchandisesince we used only identical product comparisons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion</ITAG>For comparisons involving purchase price transactions, we made currencyconversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). For comparisons involvingESP transactions, we used the official exchange rates in effect on thedates of U.S. sales, in accordance with section 773(a)(1) of the Act, asamended by section 615 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. All currencyconversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal Reserve Bank.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Japan. Section733(e)(1) fo the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determinethat there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 733(e)(1)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) the volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.We have determined in past investigations whether imports have been massiveby examining the Department's import data. However, because the Department'simport data pertaining to the subject merchandise are based on basket TSUSAcategories, we determined in these investigations that company-specificdata on shipments of the subject merchandise are the most appropriate basisfor our preliminary determinations of critical circumstances. Furthermore,we believe that company-specific critical circumstances determinationsbetter fulfill the objective of the critical circumstances provisions ofdeterring specific companies that may try to increase imports massivelyprior to the suspension of liquidation.Therefore, we have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigationsto supply monthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the presentin order for the Department to base the critical cricumstances determinationson company-specific data. Because Minebea failed to submit monthly shipmentdata on ball bearings, we preliminarily determine, as best informationavailable, that Minebea's imports of ball bearings have been massive overa relatively short period of time.Based on our analysis of the monthly shipment data submitted by the otherrespondents in these investigations, we have preliminarily found that thereis a reasonable basis to believe or suspect that imports of the followingclasses or kinds of merchandise from the companies listed below have beenmassive over a relatively short period of time.I. Ball Bearings<ITAG tagnum="15">A. Minebea</ITAG>II. Spherical Roller Bearings<ITAG tagnum="25">A. Koyo</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">B. Nachi</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">C. NSK</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">D.

NTN</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(B) aremet for the above companies and classes or kinds of merchandise. For the companies and classes of merchandise listed above, we then examinedrecent antidumping duty cases and found that there are currently no findingsof dumping of the subject merchandise by Japanese manufacturers, producers,or exporters in the United States. We also reviewed the antidumping actionsof other countries made available to us through the Antidumping Code Committeeof the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. On July 19, 1984, as setforth in Council Regulation No. 2089/84, the European Economic Community(EEC) imposed antidumping duties on ball bearings with a greatest externaldiameter of not more than 30 millimeters from Japan. On June 24, 1985,as set forth in Council Regulation No. 1739/85, the EEC imposed antidumpingduties on ball bearings with a greatest external diameter of more than30 millimeters from Japan. On February 5, 1987, as set forth in CouncilRegulation No. 374/87, the EEC imposed antidumping duties on cast or pressedsteel housings fitted with ball bearings from Japan. As this constitutesa history of dumping of ball bearings from Japan, we find that the requirementsof section 733(e)(1)(A) are met with respect to ball bearings. With respect to the remaining four classes or kinds of merchandise, itis our standard practice to impute knowledge of dumping under section 733(e)(1)(A)of the Act when the estimated margins in our determinations are of sucha magnitude that the importer should realize that dumping exists with regardto the subject merchandise. Normally, we consider estimated margins of25 percent or greater to be sufficient. [<T3>See, e.g., Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value; TaperedRoller Bearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, from Italy </T3>(52FR 24198, June 29, 1987).] However, in cases where the foreign manufacturersells in the United States through a related company, we consider thatlower margins may be sufficient. Given the preliminary margins found forKoyo with respect to sales of spherical roller bearings and needle rollerbearings, and for NTN with respect to sales of plain bearings, and thefact that these companies sell in the United States through related companies,we find that the requirements of section 733(e)(1)(A) are met for thesecompanies with respect to those classes or kinds of merchandise. The following chart sets forth our company-specific preliminary determinationswith respect to the existence of critical circumstances for each companyand each class or kind of merchandise from Japan. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p6,8/9,g1,t1,s50,xs36</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Critical circumstances</H1>Ball bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Minebea <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nachi <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NSK <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All Others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Spherical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nachi <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NSK <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Cylinderical roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Nachi <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NSK <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Needle roller bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Koyo <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No. </D></ITAG>Plain bearings: <ITAG tagnum="2">Minebea <D>No. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NTN <D>Yes. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>No.</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We will verify the information used in making our final determinationsin accordance with section 776(b) of this Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(d) of the Act, we are directing the U.S.Customs Service to suspend liquidation of all entries of the subject merchandisefrom Japan, as defined in the ``Scope of Investigations'' section of thisnotice, that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after the date of publication of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, in accordance with section 733(d)(1) of theAct.
