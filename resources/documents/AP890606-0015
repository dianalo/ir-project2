RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Civil rights advocates are accusing theSupreme Court of abandoning the nation's 25-year-old commitment tofair treatment in the workplace for minorities and women.   They expressed alarm and dismay over a ruling Monday they saidundercuts the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and will make it far moredifficult for workers to prove with statistical evidence that theyare victims of racial or gender bias.   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciarysubcommittee on civil and constitutional rights, said, ``If thecourt continues down this path, the civil rights laws will be justan empty shell.''   But Edwards did not predict any immediate action in Congress toreverse the 5-4 court ruling.   ``It's a major step backwards,'' said Patrick Patterson of theNAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ``The court has made itmuch more difficult for (plaintiffs) to win and at the same timehas made it easier for employers to defend themselves.''   Barry Goldstein, also with the fund, predicted civil rightslawyers now will concentrate on cases where they can proveintentional discrimination and seek big money damages to punishemployers who discriminate.   ``It is going to make litigation a lot tougher and a lotnastier,'' he said. ``It means fewer cases and bigger awards.''   But business leaders hailed the ruling and said most employerswill remain committed to affirmative action even if the threat oflosing lawsuits is reduced.   Stephen Bokat of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said, ``I'm reallypleased. It went much further than I thought the court would go.This means fewer specious cases will be brought. Employers aregoing to be able to defend these cases more easily,'' he said.   Monday's ruling focused on so-called ``disparate impact'' caseswhere allegations of bias are based on statistics showingunder-representation for minorities rather than deliberatediscrimination.   The decision divided the high court sharply and prompted bitterremarks from the dissenting justices.   ``One wonders whether the majority still believes that racediscrimination _ or, more accurately, race discrimination againstnon-whites _ is a problem in our society, or even remembers that itever was,'' said Justice Harry A. Blackmun in a dissenting opinion.   The court overturned a lower court ruling that had favoredFilipinos, Alaska natives and Asians employed during the summer atAlaska salmon canneries. The minority groups said they have beenrelegated to the lower-paying jobs there.   The justices sent the case back to the lower courts withinstructions to use the high court's new guidelines making it moredifficult for the minority groups to win their lawsuit.   Justice Byron R. White, writing for the court, said that whenminorities use statistics to show they are bias victims, employersonly must produce evidence that there is a legitimate reason forapparently neutral business practices.   The burden of proving the practices are non-discriminatory _ ofpersuading a jury there is no bias _ does not shift to theemployer, White said.   He added that the workers must suggest alternative practicesthat do not have an unfair impact on minorities, but said employerscannot be forced to adopt the alternatives if they are more costly.   The court also limited the statistical evidence that minoritiescan use to prove discrimination.   For example, White said a lack of minority group members inskilled jobs is not evidence of bias if the absence reflects ``adearth of qualified non-white applicants for reasons that are not(the employer's) fault.''   He said the minority groups must show that anyunder-representation in skilled jobs is tied directly to specificbusiness practices under attack.   White said that without such protection for employers their onlyrecourse to eliminate racial imbalance in their work forces wouldbe unlawful quotas.   In other action, the court:   _Ruled, 5-2, that the main method used by the Church ofScientology to receive money from members does not entitle them tofederal income tax deductions.   _Handed artists and authors a victory by unanimously ruling thata homeless-rights group in the nation's capital does not holdexclusive copyright to a sculpture it commissioned an artist tocreate.   _Cleared the way for trial of a government lawsuit against junkbond specialist Michael Milken and removed a major obstacle to a$650 million payment by his former employer to investors and thefederal treasury.   _Rejected an appeal by Medicare patients who want to use theirown money to pay for an assistant surgeon in eye cataractoperations.</TEXT></DOC>
