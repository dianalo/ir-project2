Shamir, arriving on an overnight flight from Tel Aviv, indicatedin his statement at Andrews Air Force Base that he will give theReagan Administration a qualified reply to the U.S. proposal tohold peace talks by May 1.   Secretary of State George P. Shultz escorted Shamir to his hotelin downtown Washington and talked with him for a half-hour overcoffee. Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci is making a similarcourtesy call later in the day.   In his arrival statement, Shamir appealed for understanding.``In our search for peace,'' he said, ``the United States hasalways been helpful, open and indispensable.''   He said ``violence, terrorism and war are endemic'' in theMiddle East and the area ``is littered with broken agreements.''   Shamir said the Camp David agreement, which led to a peacetreaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979 but failed to resolve thePalestinian issue, ``should serve as our guide'' in the currentsearch for a negotiating formula.   He said if past accords were ignored ``future agreements will bemeaningless.'' The Camp David agreement called for self-rule forthe 1.5 million Palestinian Arabs who live on the Israeli-held WestBank and in Jordan. Jordan and the Palestinians did not participatein the talks, which ended in failure in 1981.   Under that agreement, a temporary arrangement would last fiveyears, setting the stage for negotiations on an overallArab-Israeli settlement in which all options, including statehood,would be open.   Shultz has proposed a three-year interim arrangement, with thefinal negotiations to begin by the end of this year.   ``We are always open to new and constructive proposdals, withour positive reaction to your useful ideas,'' Shamir told hisAmerican hosts.   The Israeli leader made no mention of the international peaceconference Shultz also proposed. His statement suggested he willattempt, during four days of talks here, to persuade Shultz to makesome changes in the proposal Shultz also has presented to Jordan.   The U.S. position is that Israel should relinquish at least someof the land it captured from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 Six-DayWar in exchange for Arab recognition.   Shamir is committed to Palestinian autonomy under the 1978 CampDavid agreement signed by the United States, Egypt and Israel, buthe is reluctant to cede the lands on which 1.5 million PalestinianArabs live under Israeli control.   Before leaving for the United States, Shamir said Sunday that hewould not call for a government vote until after his trip.   ``After I come back with a summation of my talks withrepresentatives of the American government, the Cabinet will meetimmediately and I think we'll have a decision on this subject,''Shamir said on Israeli radio. ``It's a matter of about a week.''   Shultz urged Shamir last week to consider the ``tickingdemographic time bomb'' of the rapidly growing Palestinianpopulation. At a congressional hearing, Shultz suggested Israel hadmuch to gain by territorial compromise.   He did not say who would take over the land _ the Palestiniansor Jordan, which occupied the West Bank from 1950 to 1967. Egyptheld Gaza during the same period.   The Palestine Liberation Organization, designated by the Arabcountries as the Palestinians' sole legitimate representative, hasvowed to dismantle Israel as a Jewish state.   Shultz and Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci planned separatecourtesy calls today on Shamir after his overnight flight fromIsrael. The tough bargaining begins Tuesday with Shultz andcontinues Wednesday with President Reagan at the White House.   The trip was planned before Palestinians on the West Bank and inGaza began staging protest demonstrations. As of Sunday, 91 hadbeen killed in three months of bloody clashes with Israeli forces.   Shamir wrote Shultz in January offering to grant Palestiniansliving in the territories self-rule on all matters except securityand foreign affairs. In a letter last week to critical U.S.senators, Shamir reaffirmed his commitment to the Camp Davidformula.   It provides for negotiations on an overall settlement after fiveyears of Palestinian autonomy. All options, including statehood,would be open.   ``We have sought peace relentlessly, but our Arab neighbors,except Egypt, still have to prove in deeds that they are willing tonegotiate peace with us,'' Shamir said.   Shultz proposed his plan for negotiations to Shamir and IsraeliForeign Minister Shimon Peres, to King Hussein of Jordan, and toPresidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Hosni Mubarak of Egypt. So far,none of the governments has responded formally.   However, Shamir was quoted last week as saying the U.S. proposalwas ``fraught with danger'' and incapable of bring peace to theregion.   ``The only word I agree with in the U.S. plan is the nameShultz,'' Shamir said, according to an account Friday in theIsraeli daily newspaper Haaretz.   Shultz has requested a decision by all sides by about mid-March.His ``deadline'' coincided with Shamir's visit.   Israelis supporting and opposing the U.S. plan staged separatedemonstrations over the weekend, with an estimated 40,000 turningout to back the American proposal and some 200,000 demonstratingagainst it.</TEXT></DOC>
