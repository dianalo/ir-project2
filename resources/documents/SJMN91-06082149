That's what this stuff tastes like.&quot;  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  P.A. GETS ANOTHER TASTE OF WELL WATER  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Indeed, Palo Altans may notice a difference in the water flowing out oftheir taps. As of Wednesday, the city had turned on two of its four wells tohelp meet its strict water allocation mandated by the San Francisco WaterDepartment.;    Already, the utilities department has been bombarded with 50to 100 calls from customers complaining about discolored, chlorine-smellingwater.;    But city officials say the number of calls pale in comparison tothose received in 1988 when the city also turned on its wells. Back then,about 1,000 calls flooded the department about the sediment-filled water.;   &quot;We're telling people to give it a few days to see if the problem they may behaving settles,&quot; said Debbie Katz, energy services manager. &quot;If it persists,they should let us know. There may be adjustments we can make.&quot;;    Since1988, new valves have been installed that open and close slowly to reduceturbulence.;    Because the water from the wells flows differently from thenormal Hetch Hetchy supply, it still may stir up sediment and rust at thebottom of the city's aging cast iron pipes. The higher mineral content of thewater also will give it a flat taste, reduce soap suds and leave whitish ringson coffeepots and bathtubs. But Katz assured residents the water is safe todrink.;    The other two wells have not been turned on because they are notyet needed, Katz said. The city, required to cut its water consumption by 27percent from 1987 levels, is 37 percent below its normal use this monthbecause of the recent wet weather.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CAROLYN JUNG, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Peninsula/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910322  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  308  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday March 22, 199100082149,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
