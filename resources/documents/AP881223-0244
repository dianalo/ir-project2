Sources who spoke on condition they not be identified said thepact was structured to minimize the investment giant's exposure toprivate civil lawsuits and put the staggering securities fraud casebehind it for good.   But few specifics of the settlement could be learned, and by lateFriday no formal document had been filed by the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office. Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said it wasunclear when details would be released.   Drexel agreed to settle the biggest fraud case in Wall Streethistory Wednesday by paying a record $650 million in fines andrestitution to the government and pleading guilty to six felonycounts.   The New York Times, quoting unidentified Drexel employees,reported Friday that the six counts would concern allegedmanipulations of stock in Stone Container Corp., Fischbach Corp.,MCA Inc. and C.O.M.B. Co., as well as ``stock parking'' violationsin Phillips Petroleum Co. and Harris Graphics Corp.   Stock parking involves hiding ownership of stock in someoneelse's name to avoid Securities and Exchange Commission disclosurerequirements.   Five of the transactions mentioned by the Times involved Drexel'srelationship with Ivan F. Boesky, the now-imprisoned inside traderwho implicated the firm and its high-yield bond financier MichaelMilken when Boesky himself was exposed more than two years ago.   The C.O.M.B. transaction was said to involve Drexel'srelationship with Princeton Newport Partners, a small New Jerseysecurities concern that was dissolved earlier this month because ofracketeering and fraud charges against five of its principals and aformer Drexel bond trader.   Pleading guilty to manipulation and parking charges is consideredless serious than insider trading, which is the use of nonpublicinformation to profit in securities dealings.   Lawyers said these pleas likely would lessen Drexel'svulnerability to multiple lawsuits by private investors, since it isdifficult to prove financial losses resulted from such wrongdoing.   The Times asserted that none of the charges would specificallyname any people who committed wrongdoing, which could furtherinsulate the firm and the individuals from civil litigation.   But sources reached by The Associated Press said it wasn't clearwhether individuals would be named, suggesting this was still anunresolved matter.   The plea agreement capped an investigation of the Wall Streetgiant that snowballed into the biggest securities fraud probe everand raised disturbing questions about the extent of greed andconflicts of interest among the big dealers in the investmentbanking business.   The agreement still requires approval from the Justice Departmentand SEC, which has accused Drexel, Milken and other employees of farmore widespread and insidious charges in a civil suit filed nearlyfour months ago.   There was no word Friday on whether the SEC would seek additionalsanctions against Drexel before consenting to the plea agreement anddropping the suit.   But there was widespread speculation that the enforcement agencywould require the expulsion of Milken from the securities businessand would likely impose stiff restraints on the operations ofDrexel's West Coast high-yield bond department, which Milkencurrently heads.   Drexel's agreement to cooperate in the government investigationgreatly increases pressure on Milken himself to settle as-yetunfiled charges against him, which reportedly include racketeeringcounts that carry enormous fines and lengthy prison terms if he isconvicted.   But spokesmen for Milken said Friday that he was stillmaintaining his innocence, and if indicted he would vindicatehimself in court.</TEXT></DOC>
