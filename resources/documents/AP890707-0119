The funeral for Kadar, who died Thursday, comes less than onemonth after an elaborate reburial ceremony for Imre Nagy, the leaderof the failed 1956 uprising who was executed on charges of hightreason under Kadar's leadership in 1958.   Kadar will be interred at the Imre Mezoe cemetery in Budapest,where senior communist leaders traditionally are buried. The radiogave no other details.   According to a medical report issued by MTI state news agencyFriday, Kadar died of respiratory and circulatory failure aftersuffering increasing respiratory difficulties for 15 years.   Only a few hours after Kadar died, the Hungarian Supreme Courtdeclared Nagy innocent of all the charges against him.   Hundreds of thousands of Hungarians turned out for Nagy's funeralJune 16 _the 31st anniversary of his execution.   It was seen as the end of Kadar's era _ a period marked byrelative prosperity in the 1970s, fostered by cautions economicreforms Kadar endorsed, and ensuing stagnation as the reforms werestalled and foreign debt mounted.   Many people stopped on Budapest streets seemed relieved at hispassing.   The Communist Party daily Nepszabadsag carried interviews Fridaywith the four members of the ruling Communist Party presidium who ina leadership reshuffle in May 1988 removed Kadar from the post hehad held for 32 years and embarked on wide-ranging political andeconomic reforms.   Karoly Grosz described Kadar as ``a man of extraordinarydecency,'' and said he continued to consult the former leader dailyfor months after he took over from him as party general secretarylast year.   Imre Pozsgay, the party's leading reformer, told the newspaperthat Kadar had done what he could under the circumstances, a clearreference to the orthodox Kremlin leadership of Leonid Brezhnev.   ``It was the constraint of the given circumstances thatunavoidably led to Kadar's weakness showing as he continued to servethe cause of the nation,'' Pozsgay said.</TEXT></DOC>
