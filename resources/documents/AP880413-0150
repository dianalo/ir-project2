Ciriaco De Mita said he will present his government toParliament next week for approval.   Giovanni Goria, a fellow Christian Democrat, resigned as premierMarch 11 after eight turbulent months in office. The alliance,which has figured in nearly all the governments this decade, alsoincluded the Socialists, Republicans, Social Democrats and Liberals.   Also remaining the same are many of the faces in the Cabinet,including Foreign Minister Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat,and Defense Minister Valerio Zanone, a Liberal.   Asked if the new government would last through the end of thelegislative term in 1992, De Mita's rival, former Socialist PremierBettino Craxi, said Tuesday: ``It would be a miracle.''   De Mita, after announcing the government on Wednesday, was askedabout Craxi's comment. ``Men don't produce miracles,'' De Mita said.   The new premier will have to grapple with some of the samecomplex and sticky issues that bedeviled Goria. They include thefuture of Italy's energy policy and how to reform a cumbersomelaw-making process and bureaucracy.   In negotiations leading to De Mita's announcement that he hadsucceeded in forming a government, the parties put off a decisionon whether to complete a nuclear plant north of Rome.   President Francesco Cossiga on March 16 asked De Mita to try toput together a government. Factional fighting among ChristianDemocrats, Goria's own party, had beleagured the Goria government,hastening its demise.   The final straw for Goria was strong Socialist objections to agovernment decision to go ahead with construction on the powerplant, despite a voter referendum which effectively called for amoratorium on nuclear development.   Right after De Mita's announcement of the Cabinet, some SocialDemocrats said they were unhappy with the two members of theirparty chosen for the Cabinet.   However, they said they would support the government.   De Mita, 60, has been leader of the Christian Democrats since1982. The party, regularly winning about one-third of the votes, isItaly's largest ballot-getter, and its leadership is considered thecountry's most powerful political seat.   De Mita is the first Christian Democrat to hold both thepremiership and the party helm in 29 years. Christian Democratswill decide if they like that novelty in the fall, when the partyconvention is expected to be held.   The new premier has said that also holding the party post giveshim the authority to govern effectively.   The son of a tailor, De Mita was born in Nusco, a poor mountainvillage east of Naples. His bald pate delights political satirists.   He was first elected to Parliament in 1963 and has held Cabinetposts, none of them key ones.   For the first time there is more than one woman minister, withcultural affairs joining special affairs as ministries headed bywomen.</TEXT></DOC>
