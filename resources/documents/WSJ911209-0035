His chief competitoris the federal penitentiary in Memphis, Tenn.   Mr. Heller contends that unfair competition fromprison-made products is forcing him to shut down HiltronicsCorp., the family-owned company he founded 21 years ago inStony Point, N.Y. Hiltronics makes only one product: audiocable used in Navy and Marine Corps airplanes andhelicopters.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Heller says that in the past four years, nearly all ofthe company's contracts have been snatched away by FederalPrison Industries Inc., a government corporation operatingunder the trade name, Unicor. It acts as the marketing armfor a growing array of products made by federal prisoninmates. Hiltronics' military orders contracts have droppedto one from two dozen four years ago, and the company hasslashed its work force to five from 45 in the period. Mr.Heller says he will padlock the plant doors in January, whenthe final job order is finished.   &quot;I'm closing down because Unicor has put us out ofbusiness,&quot; says Mr. Heller, 69 years old, in a telephone callfrom his new retirement home in Boca Raton, Fla. &quot;Instead ofoperating an electronics plant, I'll be on the golf course.&quot;   Richard Seiter, Unicor's chief executive, says he'sunfamiliar with Mr. Heller's complaint. But he says a marketstudy ordered by Congress and conducted by the accountingfirm DeLoitte andamp; Touche found Unicor's impact on the privatesector to be &quot;insignificant.&quot;   Mr. Seiter says the Defense Department often urges prisonindustries to produce a product that may be made by a singleprivate vendor to ensure a source of supply. &quot;The militaryknows we're going to be there,&quot; Mr. Seiter says.   But small companies find plenty to worry about. Unicor'ssales in the year ended Sept. 30, 1990 totaled $343 million,down 5% from the previous year -- but up 44% from $239million in 1985. As prison populations have soared in recentyears, both federal and state prisons have sharplyaccelerated efforts to keep inmates busy, partly to offsetthe effects of overcrowding.   This expansion has pushed prison industries into acollision course with small businesses. Government contractsplay a crucial role in launching and sustaining many smallcompanies. Congress has even decreed that certain federalsupply areas be &quot;set aside&quot; exclusively for small businesses.But government contracts are Unicor's sole fodder.   Under the law, Unicor can sell only to the federalgovernment. But its products have &quot;super preference&quot; in theprocurement system, meaning that government customers such asthe Pentagon are required to buy from the prison catalog,provided the prison products meet specification and pricingrules, even if it means dropping longtime private suppliers.   This has helped Unicor grow far beyond any traditionalprison-shop operation stamping out license plates. Itsprofessional-looking catalog lists 150 products in 46industries, from office furniture and pajamas, to wiring forguided missile systems and computer data entry services.Small businesses contend the prison industries increasinglypoach on their territory and enjoy unfair advantages doingso.   Thomas W. Raftery Inc., a drapery manufacturer inHartford, Conn., saw its government sales drop from $1.5million in 1985 to $750,000 last year after Unicor beganbidding on government drapery orders. The prison bidsprevailed even though draperies had been granted set-asidestatus for small business. &quot;We became pretty dependent on thefederal market, {and} they simply took the customers awayfrom us,&quot; says Gary Rigoletti, Raftery's president.   Small business is lobbying for a change. Says LeslieAubin, a legislative representative with the Washington-basedNational Federation of Independent Business: &quot;It's fine forprisoners to have factories. It's a noble cause. We're justasking for a level playing field.&quot;   Responding to such complaints, Congress is starting to getinvolved. The industrial machine staffed by prison labor &quot;hasbeen served up the federal market on a silver platter,&quot; saysSen. Alan Dixon. The Illinois Democrat is sponsoring a billthat would limit Unicor's expansion into new markets and endits super-preference marketing advantage.   But industrial jobs are &quot;the key factor in combating theadverse impact of crowding in prison setting,&quot; said J.Michael Quinlan, the federal prison director.   &quot;We're not in the business of making money. We're in thebusiness of employing inmates,&quot; Mr. Quinlan said. &quot;Wefeatherbed like crazy. We look for the least efficient way todo it.&quot;   Mr. Quinlan raises additional fear among small businessowners when he cites prison industries' expansion goal: 30new prison factories to be added to the current 80 work sitesby 1998.   Gary Folino says he was surprised when his Franklin, Ohio,printing company lost a contract to print 1990 temporary autolicense tags for Tennessee. His firm had won the contractfour of the previous five years. The winning bid of $63,600,or $4,400 under Mr. Folino's, was submitted by Pride, theindependent training organization for Florida's prisonsystem.   Mr. Folino says prison industries earmark opportunities bycombing lists of government contracts and then biddingslightly less than the winning bid of the previous year.Prisons can do this, Mr. Folio says, because they aren'tsubject to minimum wage requirements and other businessoverhead costs.   Pamela Jo Davis, Pride's president, says prison industriesrespond to opportunities in business-like fashion.   To which Mr. Folio grumbles: &quot;If I paid my employees 35cents an hour, I would be shut down. A prison company canunderbid anybody, except maybe another state prison.&quot;   Florida's penal system pays its inmates 45 cents to 55cents an hour in direct wages, Ms. Davis says.</TEXT></DOC>
