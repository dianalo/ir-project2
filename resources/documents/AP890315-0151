Anderson,longest-held of the 15 Western hostages in Lebanon, begins his fifthyear of captivity Thursday with no sign that he will be freed soon.   In the last message his captors allowed him to send _ a briefvideotape Oct. 31 four days after his 41st birthday _ Anderson said:``I find it difficult to keep my hopes and my courage high.''   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was returing home from a tennis game March 16, 1985, whengunmen seized him in Moslem west Beirut.   His captors belong to Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslemgroup whose name means Islamic Holy War. It is believed to be partof the fundamentalist Shiite militia Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Islamic Jihad also holds Thomas Sutherland, 57, an American bornin Scotland who was acting dean of agriculture at the AmericanUniversity of Beirut when he was abducted June 9, 1985.   Shiites also hold most of the other Western hostages: sevenAmericans, three Britons, an Italian, a Belgian and an Irishman.   Among them is Church of England envoy Terry Waite, 48. He droppedfrom sight Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beirut hotel tonegotiate with Islamic Jihad on behalf of Anderson and Sutherlandreleased.   Six organizations of Western journalists observed Anderson'sanniversary by asking the world's media to disseminate a``solidarity with Anderson'' statement they issued.   It urges President Bush and his administration ``to use everypossible means at their disposal to bring Terry Anderson and otherhostages home.''   The International Press Institute said: ``We appeal togovernments throughout the free world to continue with their effortsto obtain Mr. Anderson's release.''   Some hope had arisen that so-called pragmatists in Iran wouldhelp free the captives. It was crushed by the new revolutionaryradicalism accompanying Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's order that hisfollowers kill Salman Rushdie as a blasphemer of Islam for writing``The Satanic Verses.''   ``The doors have been slammed shut again,'' said the Rev.Lawrence Jenco, an American Roman Catholic priest kidnapped byIslamic Jihad on Jan. 8, 1985.   He shared a cell with Anderson for several months and was freedJuly 26, 1986, one of three American hostages released in PresidentRonald Reagan's arms-for-hostages deal with Iran.   Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who leads the campaign for hisrelease, said ``the situation has fallen apart again'' because ofthe furor over Rushdie.   Islamic Jihad has demanded that Kuwait free pro-Iranianextremists convicted for the December 1983 bombings of the U.S. andFrench embassies in the Persian Gulf emirate.   Kuwait refused. Two of the 17 bombers were released earlier thisyear after serving their five-year sentences, but they were notconsidered key figures.   One of the men Islamic Jihad wants most is believed to beMustapha Youssef Badreddin, a cousin and brother-in-law of ImadMugniyeh. Lebanese and Western intelligence agencies say Mugniyeh isIslamic Jihad's leader and a senior figure in Hezbollah.   Badreddin and two other bombers were sentenced to death but havenot been executed.   Among those serving life sentences is Hassan Youssed Musawi, acousin of Hussein Musawi, who leads another pro-Iranian Shiitefaction in Lebanon.   Most of the Western hostages are believed held in undergroundcells in Beirut's teeming southern slums, a Shiite stronghold.   The last communication from Anderson's captors was a blurredinstant photograph of him with a cake, released Nov. 4, eight daysafter his 41st birthday.   An accompanying statement accused the Reagan administration ofavoiding steps that would free the hostages and said thejournalist's release could be achieved only by ``the implementationof our just demands.''   Anderson has never seen his 3-year-old daughter Sulome, bornthree months after his abduction. Her mother, Madeleine, who isLebanese and lives in Cyprus, sent a letter to Beirut newspapers inthe hope his captors would let him read it.   ``I would like to wake up and find you by my side ready foranother day together, but I know this is not going to happen at thismoment and today is four years since we last saw each other,'' shewrote.   ``I should be heartbroken, sad and depressed today. ... I am notthat at all because ... what's gone is only days of the many yearsthat await us, and our daughter is a constant reminder of that.   ``She is everything I know you want her to be. She needs you, weboth need you very much, our need is becoming the source of ourstrength and patience.'' Tragedy has struck Anderson's family sincehe was kidnapped, but fellow hostages who have been freed say hedoes not know it.   His father, Glenn R. Anderson, died of cancer on Feb. 15, 1986,at age 69. His elder brother Glenn Richard Jr. died of cancer onJune 7 of that year, aged 46, four days after making a videotape onwhich he pleaded with Islamic Jihad from his sickbed to free Terry.   Anderson probably is unaware of one other death: Ali Ayub, whosources say led the kidnap gang, was killed in a Beirut shootoutwith rival militiamen later in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
