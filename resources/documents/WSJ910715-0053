Across a wide range of issues, from trade to foreign aidto interest rates, the U.S. and Europe increasingly findthemselves at odds. And the Europeans, confident in thestrength of a unified European economy and freed from theSoviet threat, are less willing than ever to bend to U.S.pressure.</LP><TEXT>   Listen, for instance, to German Chancellor Helmut Kohl,speaking to a group of business students in Switzerland.&quot;Europe's return to its original unity means that the '90swill be the decade of Europe, not Japan,&quot; he said in a recent45-minute speech, which made only one brief reference to theU.S. &quot;This is what we've all dreamed about. This is Europe'shour.&quot;   Or listen to new French Prime Minister Edith Cresson atlast month's Paris Air Show, defiantly criticizing U.S.efforts to end subsidies for Airbus Industrie. &quot;United with afaultless solidarity, we Europeans will not let our civilianaviation industry be dismantled.&quot;   The U.S.-Europe relationship remains a close one. The twoeconomic titans sell nearly $100 billion of goods andservices each year to each other. And for the moment, thebalance of trade is in the U.S.'s favor. The U.S. hasrecently been running surpluses in its trade with theEuropean Community.   The recent Gulf War showed that in times of emergency theAtlantic alliance still stays strong. Britain and Franceprovided significant military help, and Germany gave billionsin financial aid.   But scratch the surface of almost any issue beingdiscussed at this week's economic summit in London, and youare likely to find a U.S.-European spat.   The U.S. blames the Europeans for undermining theso-called Uruguay round of global trade talks by refusing todismantle its massive farm subsidy system. And administrationofficials acknowledged last week that they don't expect anybreakthroughs from the Europeans at this week's economicsummit of the Group of Seven industrialized nations. TheEuropeans &quot;seem to have a degree of myopia that isastonishing,&quot; complains former Trade Representative BillBrock. &quot;In effect, they seem to be saying they aren'tinterested in the rest of the world. So why should the restof the world be interested in them?&quot;   As for interest rates, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradycontinues his campaign to get the Germans to abandon theirtough anti-inflation policy and bring down interest rates tospur growth, but German officials are disdainful. &quot;Bradywants us to cut our rates for political reasons, so Bush canget re-elected,&quot; opines a top Bundesbank official. &quot;Bush isgoing to get re-elected anyway, and we'll cut our rates whenwe want to.&quot;   The U.S. fears that a united Europe will increasingly usegovernment subsidies and industrial policy to further itseconomic aims. That's why the row over Airbus, built by aEuropean consortium with government support, has become sohot.   In a letter sent to President Bush on Friday, Sen. JohnDanforth, a Republican from Missouri, headquarters ofMcDonnell-Douglas, and five of his Senate colleagues urgedthe President &quot;to express in the strongest possible terms atthe economic summit in London the concerns of the U.S.government about the continuing huge subsidization of AirbusIndustrie by a number of European governments.&quot; Mrs. Cressonsays simply that she doesn't understand the &quot;recent attack onAirbus.&quot;   Meanwhile, the U.S. has completed work on a package ofmeasures to ease restrictions on imports of steel andtextiles from the new democracies in Eastern Europe,according to Treasury Secretary Brady. Some officials say thereal purpose of the package is to put pressure on theEuropean Community -- the most important market for thosecountries -- to do the same. U.S. officials say the Europeanshave been stingy in opening up to imports of steel, textilesand farm products from their Eastern neighbors. &quot;Our firstintention is to do the most the U.S. can do,&quot; Mr. Brady saidFriday. &quot;If that provides an incentive for the Europeans todo as much or better, that's all to the good.&quot;   A rash of other trade disputes, over products ranging fromtelecommunications to oilseeds, continues to fester, withlittle progress in sight. Earlier this year, 59 U.S. senatorscalled for trade retaliation against the European Communitybecause of its failure to comply with GATT findings on itsbarriers to soybean imports. U.S. producers estimate they arelosing $2 billion of sales because of these prohibitions.&quot;The U.S. has waited long enough for action by the EuropeanCommunity to meet its obligations,&quot; Sen. Danforth said.   The question of how to defend Europe in the future is alsoputting strain on the relationship. A flap recently emerged,for instance, over plans for a rapid action force that wouldgroup soldiers from various nations under a single command.The U.S. and the United Kingdom want a force organized underthe North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which includes theU.S., to be mobilized within Europe against threats from theoutside. The French, however, favor a European force thatcould also be sent to other parts of the world.   &quot;It is evident that the U.S. is disengaging from Europe,&quot;says Mrs. Cresson. &quot;But it can't leave and at the same timeask us Europeans not to have a defense of our own. This isobviously illogical, but is what seems to be being forced onus.&quot;   The subject of Soviet aid is also contentious. GermanChancellor Kohl has taken the lead in pushing for an aidpackage for the Soviets, while the U.S. and Japan haveresisted. But even in Europe, the support for a big aidpackage is limited. &quot;At the moment we can offer cooperation,&quot;says Mrs. Cresson, &quot;but as for aid, the needs of the SovietUnion seem limitless, so that makes it a very hard questionto answer.&quot;   Some officials play down the long list of disagreementsbetween the two continents. &quot;I'm not sure there's anincrease&quot; in trade disputes, Frans Andriessen, the EuropeanCommunity's top trade negotiator, told reporters recently.&quot;We have of course some problems with the United States, butwhen you look at the volume of trade between the U.S. andEuropean Community, the trade covered by frictions is rathersmall.&quot;   And U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills blames thebackup in unresolved issues on the delays in completing theglobal trade talks. She says she doesn't &quot;think suddenly therelationship between the U.S. and the EC has soured.&quot;   But most observers recognize that the problem is growing.A recent draft report prepared for the Trilateral Commission,for instance, warns that Europe's increasingself-preoccupation &quot;pushes American concerns to the backburner,&quot; which in turn fuels resentment against Europe in theU.S. Congress and elsewhere.   Underlying the new level of tension are the growing moveson both continents toward regional economic integration.Europe continues its effort to build an integrated marketwith uniform tax and business regulation by 1992, and is alsocutting bilateral trade deals with some East Europeannations. The U.S., for its part, has already negotiated afree-trade agreement with Canada and is pushing ahead on anagreement with Mexico.   The result is a new competition in oneupmanship. PresidentBush wrote Congress in May that his proposed North Americanfree-trade agreement, covering about 360 million people,&quot;offers an historic opportunity to create the largest marketin the world.&quot; That sounds startlingly like the claims madeby European Community President Jacques Delors, whofrequently reminds listeners that his 12-nation group, with atotal population of 340 million, will be &quot;the largest marketin the world.&quot;   And the regional blocs may be expanding. In Europe,there's the possibility that Austria, Sweden, Norway,Switzerland, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia couldeventually join the community. President Bush, in themeantime, is making overtures to all of Latin America, andhas already signed framework trade and investment agreementswith 14 of those nations.   On both sides of the Atlantic, fears are rising that theseregional trading blocs will be formed in a way that excludesoutsiders. Ambassador Hills, for instance, worries that tradeagreements cut by the Europeans tend to &quot;pick and choose&quot;which trade sectors to liberalize, and encourage increasedtariffs on outsiders. &quot;That's not liberalization, and itwon't be the motor of economic growth,&quot; she warns.   The U.S. has been pushing hard for a more formal role inthe effort to unify European markets. But the U.S. entreatieshave been brushed off in Brussels, where officials say theyaren't about to give the U.S. &quot;a 13th seat&quot; at thecommunity's negotiating table. As a result, according to theTrilateral Commission draft report, &quot;the prospects forfriction seem to be increasing.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
