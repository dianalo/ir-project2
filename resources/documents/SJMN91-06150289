Merchants are struggling to bringmore life back to Los Gatos' downtown after the October, 1989 earthquakedevastated much of the business district.;    The downtown is almost entirelyrebuilt now, but the merchants say they could use additional funds to dothings like promoting downtown sales events and cultural happenings and hiringa consultant to research small-town retail trends. The district has not yetbeen formed.;    Assistant Town Manager Mark Linder calculated that the townwould lose about $57,000 in new business tax money from the original estimateof $200,200 if merchants in the town's central business district were to jointhe improvement district. He said there are about 700 business in the downtownarea, out of 2,793 townwide.;    Business taxes are based on gross receipts.For instance, a retail business that earns $500,000 a year currently paysabout $300 in annual business taxes. Under the new proposal, which goes intoeffect July 1, a business earning that amount would pay $450.;    Linder saidbusiness taxes were last increased in 1983. He said Los Gatos' business tax ishigh compared with other communities its size in the county, but some of theother cities also levy a utility tax to raise income. Los Gatos does not.;   Council members decided to pass on the idea of imposing a utility tax orraising other taxes in favor of what they called a &quot;modest&quot; increase in thebusiness tax.;    Because of possible legal problems over raising the taxwithout voter approval, town officials will seek an opinion from the courts onthe validity of the new taxes.;    In addition to the business tax increase,the council recently approved higher prices for a wide range of town services,from building fees to late library charges, that are expected to add moreincome to the 1992 budget.;    The town's finances have suffered dramaticallysince the 1989 quake and subsequent falling sales tax revenues took a big biteout the general fund budget.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  CONNIE SKIPITARES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910529  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  432  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 29, 199100150289,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
