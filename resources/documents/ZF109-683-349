 The important features of the CD-ROM are its caactivity, permanence, fast production process, and low per-unit productioncost.andP;  CD-ROMs are ideal for data that is not expected to change soon, orinformation that needs to be distributed to a large number of users.andM;The ideal applications for the CD-ROM include:andM;* Providing software manuals for computer systemsandM;* Providing a large reference document, such as a dictionary or anencyclopediaandM;* Providing a training package including reading materials, graphics, andtestsandM;* Providing large-scale software distribution.andM;The HP Series 6100 Model 600/A HP-IB CD-ROM drive can support softwaredistribution, on-line data or documentation retrieval, computer-basedtraining, and other multimedia applications.andP;  Special software securityfeatures are designed into the Model 600/A to provide data protection andsoftware distribution security.andP;  The capacity of CD-ROMs allows a wholeoperating system and other software subsystems to be stored on one disk.andO;Since customers may not purchase all the subsystem software, the softwareprotection scheme ensures that customers have access only to the subsystemsthey purchased.andP;  The article on page 49 describes the software protectionscheme employed by the Model 600/A.andM;The Model 600/A uses HP Command Set 80 (CS-80) protocol to communicate withthe host computer over the HP-IB interface.andP;  Command Set 80 defines a set ofcommands that enable communication between an HP disk and the host computer.andO;For HP 9000 users, the CD-ROM reader can be used to read non-HP CD-ROMsprovided they are created in the ISO 9660 High Sierra standard file format.andO;The article on page 54 describes the ISO 9660 support.andM;The rest of this article presents an overview of CD-ROM technology and theModel 600/A controller board.andM;CD-ROM TechnologyandM;CD-ROM is an optical storage technology.andP;  Data is read from the disk using alaser beam.andP;  The CD-ROM is a platter 120 mm in diameter that has pits (holes)and lands (material between holes) on one surface, arranged in a continuousspiral (see Fig.andP;  1).andP;  The pits and lands represent the information (ones andzeros) stored on the disc.andP;  A one is represented by a transition from a pitto a land or from a land to a pit, and the length of the land or pitrepresents the number of zeros (see Fig.andP;  2).andP;  The pits and lands form atrack that is 0.6 micrometers wide (track pitch = 1.6  Am) which yields atrack density of 15,875 tracks per inch.andP;  A combination of a pit and a landthat follows it can run from 0.9 to 3.3 [micro-m] in length.andP;  To put thesenumbers in perspective, the total length of the groove on a CD-ROM disk isapproximately three miles and the total number of pits is almost two billion.andO;A CD-ROM disk can store up to 600 megabytes of computer data.andM;Data is not written on the CD-ROM by the user's computer.andP;  Data must bemastered using a specialized publishing process.andP;  Subsequent disks can beinexpensively made from the master.andP;  There are three steps to making aCD-ROM: data conversion, premastering, and mastering.andP;  In the data conversionphase, the data is organized and formatted.andP;  Premastering adds the errorcodes and indexes needed for efficient CD-ROM use.andP;  The master, used to stampthe pits in the production discs, is finally created in the mastering phase.andO;A new master must be made every time a new disk is published.andP;  However, oncethe initial cost of publishing the master is done, the cost of reproducingcopies is very low.andM;Recording FormatandM;The format of how data is formatted on a compact disc is specified in twostandards called the red book and the yellow book.&quot;' The red book was thefirst standard and it specifies the format for digital audio data.andP;  Theyellow book is an extension to the red book and it specifies the format forother forms of digital data, particularly computer data.andM;Data is recorded on the disk using a code called EFM (eight-to-fourteenmodulation).andP;  The recording circuits use a lookup table to convert each eightbits of data to 14 channel bits.andP;  Three merge bits are inserted after each14-bit symbol to ensure that the symbol ends do not violate the rules of theEFM code and to equalize the total lengths of pits and lands on the disk (seeFig.andP;  3).andP;  The smallest size of an information unit on the CD-ROM is called aframe.andP;  The contents of a frame are shown in Fig.andP;  4.andP;  The frame is thesynchronization element for CD audio and the object of error correctionencoding for computer data.andM;The synchronization pattern of channel bits identifies the beginning of eachframe and does not participate in the EFM coding.andP;  The control subcodeprovides some information about the data in a frame such as the presence ofCD audio or data symbols.andP;  The data symbols represent the information contentof the frame.andP;  These symbols can represent audio, user data, or a third levelof error correction coding.andP;  The last eight bytes are parity bytes used forerror correction.andP;  The 24 bytes of information represented by 588 channelbits are combined with other frames of 24 bytes of information into sectorsof 98 frames.andP;  Sectors occur 75 times per second making the transfer ratefrom the disk 176,400 bytes/s (98 frames/sector x 24 bytes/frame x 75sectors/second).andP;  The organization of the bytes in a disk sector is shown inFig.andP;  5.andM;Error Correction CodeandM;The mode byte shown in Fig.andP;  5 describes the nature of the data contained inthe data field of the CD-ROM.andP;  The yellow book standard defines two modes forcomputer data.andP;  In mode 1, the CD-ROM can store up to 553 Mbytes ofinformation on a 60-minute disk.andP;  Mode 1 uses the 288 EDC/ECC (errordetection coding and error correction coding) bytes to improve the data errorrate.andP;  In mode 2 the CD-ROM can store up to 630 Mbytes because all the bytesare used for data (including the 288 EDC/ECC bytes).andP;  Mode 2 can be used forapplications in which error rates are not critical such as the storage ofgraphical information.andM;For the model 600/A there are three levels of error correction.andP;  The firsttwo levels, CIRC1 and CIRC2 (CIRC stands for cross interleaved Reed-Solomoncode), are provided by the CD audio standard.andP;  The third level of errorcorrection encoding is provided for mode 1 data by a Reed-Solomonproduct-like code, using the EDC/ECC bytes.andP;  The error correction data isplaced on the disk when it is mastered.andP;  The first two levels of errorcorrection are done on all data fields and are decoded in real time by theCD-ROM drive.andP;  The third level is decoded by the CD-ROM controller.andP;  See thearticle on page 42 for more information about error correction on the Model600/A.andM;Disk AddressingandM;On a CD-ROM disk, the groove is divided into a lead-in portion that containsa table of contents, a program area that contains user data, and a lead-outarea that contains all zeros.andP;  The table of contents resides in CD-ROM area0:0:0 to 0:1:74  O minutes, 1 second, 74th frame).andP;  The table of contentscontains the absolute address for each existing track (from 0 to 99 minutes).andO;Each track can contain only one mode of data storage.andP;  Audio tracks anddigital tracks have buffer areas between them.andP;  The start of the user areastarts at frame location 0:2:0 (logical address  :0:0).andP;  If present, thesystem area directory resides in the program area starting at location 0:2:0.andO;The system area data files, which can exist anywhere on the disk, containinformation used by the drive or host computer, such as disk securityinformation, logical sector size, CS-80 volume boundaries, and the CD-ROMrevision number.andP;  The Model 600/A looks for a constant in the system area todetermine whether a disc is an HP CD-ROM.andM;The Controller BoardandM;The Model 600/A controller board provides the interface between the nativeCD-ROM drive and the host computer.andP;  It has three sections: the controller,the disk interface, and the audio section (see Fig.andP;  6).andP;  The controllerprovides the intelligence on the board and is responsible for:andM;* Communicating with the host computer via the HP-IB interfaceandM;* Controlling the CD-ROM drive through the 19.2-kbit/s UARTandM;*  Accessing the software protection information in the EEPROMandM;*  Providing the software protection keys to the unscramblerandM;*  Programming the 4-Mbyte/s DMA controller for DMA transfers to the host viathe HP-IB.andM;The unscrambler circuit is responsible for decoding the data on the disk thatis scrambled (encoded) for software security.andP;  It operates at a transfer rateof 154 kbytes/s and is capable of unscrambling data from the media or fromthe host.andP;  If the CD-ROM in the drive is not an HP disk, the controllerswitches the unscrambler out of the inbound path of CD-ROM data.andP;  Thecontroller uses the keyword information in the EEPROM and the passwordinformation from the host to determine the key for the unscrambler.andM;The disk interface provides the entry point for CD-ROM data.andP;  Data arrivesfrom the disk in bursts of 16 bits at 2.1 Mbits/s.andP;  These bursts occur onceevery 11.36 microseconds giving an overall transfer rate of 176.4 kbytes/s.andO;The CDROM data is in serial format so it must be deserialized before beingsent to the unscrambler or directly to the HP-IB interface.andM;The Model 600/A can also play audio information recorded on a CD or a CD-ROM.andO;The CD-ROM standard divides all data into groups of 100 tracks and each trackcan be either audio or digital.andP;  Audio information from the drive is serialand arrives at a data rate of 44,100 16-bit samples/s on each channel.andP;  Thesamples alternate between left and right channels.andP;  Audio data reconstructionis accomplished with a 4 x oversampling digital filter with errorinterpolation, and a digital-to-analog converter (DAC) that operates at176,400 stereo 16-bit samples/s.andP;  The oversampling filter interpolatesbetween samples and outputs data at the rate of the DAC.andP;  The filter is usedto deal with aliasing.andP;  When a sampled signal is reconstructed, a Fouriertransform of the resultant signal shows a baseband signal and a modulatedcarrier at the sampling frequency.andP;  If the audio rate at 44,100 16-bitsamples/s signal is reconstructed and the sampled signal is frequency limitedto 20 kHz (top end of the audio band), the quiet zone, which is the rangebetween the recreated baseband signal and its alias, is only 4.1 kHz wide.andO;To filter out the alias effectively requires a very steep low-pass filter(most implementations use a seven-pole Chebychev filter).andP;  It's not practicalto build such a filter without creating some phase distortion in thehigh-frequency end of the the baseband signal.andP;  By digitally recreatingsamples between each recorded sample oversampling) the signal can bereconstructed at a higher sampling frequency, thus increasing the width ofthe quiet zone and decreasing the demand on the low-pass filter.andP;  Followingthe DAC is a low-pass filter that attenuates most of the alias signal.andO;Finally, the signal is routed to the backplane preamplifier and to thepotentiometer for the volume control, which drives an all-pass amplifier thatdrives the headphones.andM;ConclusionandM;Compact disk technology started as a technological advancement in noisereduction for the musical recording distribution industry.andP;  It has become avaluable tool in the computer industry for the distribution of information,manuals, and software.andP;  The HP Series 6100 Model 600/A HP-IB CD-ROM drive,which has complete industry-standard compatibility, full error correctionsupport, software security, and CD audio support, provides the full spectrumof CD-ROM technology to HP's computer systems.andM;ReferencesandM;1.andP;
