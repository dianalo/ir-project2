The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Thursday it was loaning$1 billion to banks owned by First RepublicBank Corp. of Dallas forsix months in a move to reassure depositors worried about thebanks' shaky real estate loans.   The infusion represents only about 5 percent of the FDIC'sinsurance fund, which backs deposits of $100,000 and less at 13,600banks. But bank analysts believe it could turn out to be the firstbig hit of a bad year for the fund.   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman isn't saying how much hebelieves his agency ultimately may have to spend to rescue the$33.2 billion holding company, the largest in Texas and the 13thbiggest in the country.   The analysts, however, are suggesting that the FirstRepublicBank loan is, in effect, a down payment on a $2 billion to$4 billion problem.   First RepublicBank is about the same size that ContinentalIllinois Corp. was in 1984 when it required the largest-evergovernment bank bailout of $4.5 billion.   And more bad news is likely from other banks, particularly inTexas, where Mcorp, a $21 billion, money-losing bank holdingcompany, has been exploring restructuring options.   But Seidman says the situations of Continental and FirstRepublicBank are not the same and he points with hope to FDICconversations with private investors and to signs that Texas'economy is rebounding.   He notes his fund's survival during 1987, the worst year forcommercial banking since the Great Depression, both in terms of lowprofits and the number of bank failures.   Despite the rescue of First City Bancorporation of Houston andthe failure of 184 banks in 1987, the FDIC fund still managed amodest increase to $18.3 billion.   ``Therefore, we don't see anything that we are going to do thisyear that is going to cause a substantial decline in the fund. Imean by substantial, 25 percent,'' he said.   However, Bert Ely, an Alexandria, Va., financial consultant,said, ``My sense is they are going to lose money.''   The fund's income from interest and from premiums paid by memberbanks _ $3.3 billion last year _ is increasing at a slower ratethan deposits, he said. The ratio of FDIC assets to insureddeposits has fallen from more than $1.20 per $100 in 1981 to closeto $1.10.   Still, the FDIC fund is in far better shape than its sister fundfor the thrift industry, the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. Unlike FSLIC, the FDIC probably would still be in the blackafter accounting for all of the problems suffered by its memberinstitutions, Ely said.   Industry experts are skeptical of the chances for FDIC's effortsto attract private investors to take on some of the risks ofoperating a restructured First RepublicBank.   ``I'm sure there probably are people who are kicking the tiresand have expressed an interest to the FDIC,'' said Stephen Skaggs,a senior analyst for Sheshunoff andamp; Co., an Austin, Texas, consultingfirm.   ``But I just don't see that there's any great appetite forinvestments (like First RepublicBank) unless the FDIC is willing toassume substantially all of the risk.''   According to Sandy Flannigan, an analyst with Paine Webber Inc.in Houston, the search for private capital for First RepublicBankdoes not improve the chances for other Texas banks such as Mcorp toattract new investors.   First City, which is getting $500 million from a privateinvestment group in addition to the FDIC money, ``was first to thewell,'' she said. ``They are in far better shape than those whofollow. There isn't an infinite number of investors interested inTexas banks.''   Ironically, the deepening bank crisis comes amid signs thatTexas' economy is improving.   ``The whole thing is just a very sad situation,'' said PaulGetman, senior financial economist of The Wefa Group, aPhiladelphia-area consulting firm. ``Just when people thought thesituation in Texas might turn around, it has in fact worsened. ...The overall economic situation ... has picked up a bit, it has justnot improved fast enough to help these banks. ... It's just toolittle too late.''   ``The scary thing ... is that if right now these banks are doingso poorly with an economy that is doing fairly well nationally,what will happen to them if the national growth turns sluggish forthe next few years?'' he asked.</TEXT></DOC>
