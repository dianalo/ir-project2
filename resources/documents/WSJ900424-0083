Withdiminishing Soviet support, and with the pullback of the EastGermans and the Romanians, Syria is now more vulnerable thanit was.   Within the context of a post-Khomeini Iran, moderates doexist. The Ayatollah took hostages in part to empty the Arabworld of Westerners. He was uninterested in economics, or ineconomic benefits that come with Western activity. But hissuccessor, President Hashemi Rafsanjani, knows that domesticturmoil is probable if he can't reverse Iran's economicslide.</LP><TEXT>   With inflation about 60% and a 25% unemployment level,Iran is engaged in a process of economic reform. Mr.Rafsanjani has imposed domestic austerity, trying to restoremonetary discipline that was lost during the Iran-Iraq war.Last October, Mr. Rafsanjani announced that Iran wouldencourage foreign trade, and would embark on at least alimited privatization campaign. Efforts to sell state-ownedmines have faltered, mostly because buyers can't be sure ofreliable electricity supplies. But private Iranian firms nowhave permission to strike deals with Western counterparts.   Iran's interest is foreign exchange, without which anation today simply disintegrates. Mr. Rafsanjani has saidthat the country will likely borrow $27 billion as part of aneffort to boost non-oil sectors. The success of that effortdepends on Western predilections. Western nations need notbetray the bedrock no-deal-with-terrorists policy to advancewhatever inclinations exist inside Iran to establish a modusvivendi with the West. If Iran's moderation is genuine, thehostages will be released, though it could take time.   Any progress with Iran also might have a bracing effect onIraq, which has emerged as one of the world's more dangerousnations. This is a country willing to use poison gas on itsopponents, and as reports in recent days indicate, Iraq hasbeen trying to develop a &quot;super gun&quot; capable of throwingchemical or nuclear warheads at its neighbors.   These seem to be days when decades of steadfastness arepaying off. Western anti-communism has paid dividends inEastern Europe, but also in the Middle East, where thecollapse of bankrolling Communist governments may force theSyrians to moderate. A steadfast unwillingness to do businesswith terrorists means that nations that practice hostagetaking will have to change if they expect Western economiccooperation.   As always, politics are treacherous in the Middle East,and progress may be quickly reversed. But Mr. Polhill'srelease is reason to hope that the politics of Iran may yetbe headed in the right direction.</TEXT></DOC>
