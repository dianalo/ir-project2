It is sitedon the periphery of a dark cloud and, although bipolar in appearance,probably does not have the same structure as typical bipolar nebulaeassociated with PMS stars. (ii) Object number 14(NS14) is an unusualcombination of emission and reflection nebulosity with a single centralsource that illuminates and excites two inner bright lobes of nebulosityand creates a more distant reflection nebula. The inner dust disc thatappears to produce the bipolar structure contains aligned grains.</TEXT></DOC>
