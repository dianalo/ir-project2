Derrick Gregory, a 39-year-old painter from Middlesex, had hisappeal for clemency denied last week by the Penang state pardonboard, said his lawyer, Rasiah Rajasingam.   ``After this, there are no more avenues for appeal. It is up tothe prison authorities to set the date for the hanging, normallybetween two to six weeks,'' Rajasingam said in a telephone interviewfrom Penang, 180 miles northwest of Kuala Lumpur.   Gregory was convicted in March 1987 of possessing 20 ounces ofheroin, which was found hidden in his boots and underwear at Penangairport in 1982. Since a law was passed in 1975 mandating the deathsentence for drug trafficking, 221 people have been sentenced todeath. Of these, 80 have been hanged.</TEXT></DOC>
