The attorney general, flanked by U.S. attorneys from New York,Chicago and Kansas City, announced plans to create six securitiesand commodities fraud units in those cities as well as Los Angeles,Denver, and San Francisco.   The announcement came just weeks after disclosure that federalinvestigators in Chicago had been conducting a two-year undercoveroperation that has turned up widespread evidence of fraud bycommodities futures traders at the Chicago Board of Trade and theChicago Mercantile Exchange.   Thornburgh said 15 federal prosecutors with experienceinvestigating insider trading, stock manipulation and othersophisticated financial crimes would be assigned to work exclusivelyin this area along with law enforcement agents.   The units will ``combat what can aptly be called crime in thesuites,'' Thornburgh said, ``the kind of criminal activity that'scarried out under the guise of respectability in the major financialmarkets.''   ``All of these investigations are difficult and require thesophisticated efforts of experienced prosecutors. They are not madeby breaking down the door and seizing the evidence,'' saidThornburgh, himself a former U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh.   The task force idea was first pressed in 1987 by federalprosecutors, including Rudolph Giuliani, the outgoing U.S. attorneyin New York who spearheaded the successful prosecution of insidertrading on Wall Street.   Thornburgh hinted that the creation of task forces in Denver, SanFrancisco, Los Angeles and Kansas City would result in criminalindictments.   ``Stay tuned,'' the attorney general told reporters.   Selection of those cities for task forces was based on ``what thehistory had been, what the pending investigation caseload was,'' hesaid.   ``The problem is bad enough that we want to undertake some extrasteps to deal with it,'' Thornburgh said.   ``The record speaks for itself in the prosecutions that have beenundertaken ... to indicate we want to bring this additionalfirepower to bear on behalf of investors who otherwise might run therisk of being defrauded and might lose their confidence in theintegrity of these markets,'' he said.   Thornburgh defended Chicago U.S. Attorney Anton Valukas, who hasbeen accused by defense attorneys of using ``strong-arm'' tactics topressure commodities traders into cooperating with the investigation.   ``Mr. Valukas has kept the department fully apprised of anysignificant investigations that he has undertaken and they have beenapproved at the appropriate levels,'' Thornburgh said.   The attorney general said the 15 new positions would be takenfrom extra slots in U.S. attorneys offices provided for in the newdrug bill and other legislation. The experienced prosecutors wouldbe replaced with new hires, he said.   Another 15 investigators and some clerical support staffers wouldbe assigned to the task forces, which would number between 30 and 40people, department officials said.   Agents from the U.S. Postal Service, the Internal RevenueService, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the CommodityFutures Trading Commission, would also be permanently assigned tothe task forces.</TEXT></DOC>
