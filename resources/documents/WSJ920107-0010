After weathering 15 days of artillery attacks by armedopposition forces on his bunker in the presidential office inTbilisi, Mr. Gamsakhurdia and his family left governmentheadquarters and piled into a Mercedes that sped across theborder, via Azerbaijian, to the neighboring republic ofArmenia. It wasn't clear if Armenia would grant Mr.Gamsakhurdia political asylum or accede to Georgianopposition demands for his repatriation.</LP><TEXT>   Leaders of the Military Council, as the leaders of thecoup d'etat refer to themselves, quickly named as head of aprovisional government opposition leader Tengiz Sigua, whohad been sacked as Georgian prime minister in August by Mr.Gamsakhurdia. Mr. Sigua said the council would remain inpower only until new parliamentary elections could be held.   Mr. Sigua, in a broadcast last night carried on Russiannational television, denied that the opposition had carriedout a coup, declaring that &quot;not only military forcesparticipated but, most importantly, the people rebelledagainst the dictatorial regime of Gamsakhurdia.&quot; Mr.Gamsakhurdia was elected to the presidency in April with morethan 85% of the popular vote. His critics charged that hequickly became a dictator. They contended that themustachioed president, a former dissident, became ruthlessafter ascending to power, jailing his most outspoken critics,closing newspapers and taking over the television station.When Mr. Gamsakhurdia refused to step down, the oppositionlaunched armed attacks to oust him.   Analysts in Moscow caution that, despite Mr.Gamsakhurdia's departure, the opposition itself remainsdivided between two main factions. Nonetheless, they notethat although the situation in Tbilisi remains murky, thingsare likely to calm down considerably after two weeks offighting that left at least 200 people dead. Mr.Gamsakhurdia's exit also should calm fears that the Russianarmy, which earlier withdrew to avoid the fighting inTbilisi, might get dragged back into fighting on Georgiansoil.   The independent news agency Interfax described jubilantcelebrations on the streets of the capital last night, aspeople cheered news of Mr. Gamsakhurdia's departure.According to Russian press reports, the opposition forcesallowed Mr. Gamsakhurdia to make his way peacefully out ofthe government headquarters to avoid a bloody siege.   With Mr. Gamsakhurdia gone, analysts said, Georgia islikely to be admitted into the Commonwealth of IndependentStates, the union that, with the exception of the threeBaltic republics, encompasses the other former Sovietrepublics. There are conflicting explanations as to whyGeorgia isn't already a member. By some accounts, thefiercely nationalistic Mr. Gamsakhurdia decided againstjoining the commonwealth, apparently fearing Russiandomination. But by other accounts, the other republicanleaders blocked Georgia's entry because of Mr. Gamsakhurdia'sundemocratic practices. Whatever the truth, the oppositionhas called for Georgia to become the commonwealth's 12thmember following Mr. Gamsakhurdia's ouster.   Mr. Gamsakhurdia's exit also bodes well for Georgia'sability to adopt economic reforms, which Russia and tovarying degrees the other former Soviet republics arepursuing. Among their many criticisms, opponents charged thatMr. Gamsakhurdia had blocked attempts to liberalize Georgia'splanned economy.   His departure also could help resolve the bloody civil warin Georgia's South Ossetian region. The Ossetians, an ethnicminority in the mountainous Transcaucasian republic, havecalled for unification with their brethren in North Ossetia,which is located across the border in Russia. Mr.Gamsakhurdia had responded to such calls by canceling theregion's autonomy and stepping up military attacks on theOssetians, which left hundreds dead and tens of thousandsdisplaced.   Tass, the official Russian news agency, said fighting inthe Ossetian region already had eased in recent days, and Mr.Sigua earlier promised to respect the autonomy of Georgia'sminority regions.</TEXT></DOC>
