The rival measure, strongly backed by Majority Leader George J.Mitchell, D-Maine, significantly alters he Bush approach toautomobile pollution but takes a similar approach to settingclean-up timetables for smog-choked cities.   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., the bill's chief sponsor, said the Bushplan ``won't get us across the finish line'' in improving airquality, and predicted the rival proposal would ``cut auto emissionsby 50 percent by the year 2000.''   Sen. John H. Chafee, R-R.I., the chief sponsor of the Bushlegislation in the Senate, also is co-sponsoring the Baucusanti-smog measure.   In all, eight Democrats and five Republicans are sponsoring therival measure.   Asked why he's backing two bills with conflicting provisions,Chafee said he agrees with the Baucus approach. But he sponsored theBush legislation, Chafee said, because he agrees with many of itsprovisions, and wanted to support the ``first effort anadministration has made in eight years'' to tackle the nation's airquality problem.   Former President Reagan did not propose a comprehensive revisionto the 1977 clean-air law during his eight years in office.   The proposal introduced Friday covers only urban smog proposals,but any clean-air legislation will also include provisions onairborne toxic chemicals and acid rain. The Bush proposal, whichcovers all three areas, is now under consideration by the HouseEnergy and Commerce environment subcommittee.   Smog is air pollution generated by motor vehicles, industry, andother sources in urban areas. A major component is ozone, which atground level is produced by the combination of hydrocarbons andnitrogen oxides _ both given off by tailpipes _ in the presence ofsunlight and heat.   Since 90 percent of the ozone breathed into the lungs is neverexhaled, with ozone molecules reacting with sensitive lung tissue tocause a number of health consequences. These include chest pains,shortness of breath, coughing, nausea, throat irritatiion andincreased susceptibility to respiratory infections.   The automobile section of the Baucus bill would, like the Bushmeasure, would tighten current tailpipe anti-pollution requirementsbut would not include two key elements of the president's proposal _a forced switch from today's gasoline to clean-burning motor fuelsin severely polluted cities and permission for automakers to averageemissions by engine category to comply with anti-pollutionrequirements.   Instead, the Senate measure would require each model to meet theemissions standards, as under current law, and would allowautomakers to choose whether to build cars using alternative fuelsor reduce pollution in other ways.   The legislation, like the Bush measure, would set deadlinesranging from five years to 20 years for cities to clean up theirsmog problems. But the placement of cities in the various categorieswould be different.   The Bush bill would give Los Angeles, New York, Houston andChicago-Gary, Ind., 20 years to sharply reduce ozone levels inreturn for adopting severe anti-pollution measures. The Baucuslegislation would place only Los Angeles in the 20-year category andwould give the other three areas 15 years.   In all, 101 geographical areas have failed to meet thenow-expired ozone cleanup timetables under current law.   Baucus, explaining the lack of an alternative fuels requirementin his bill, said, ``I don't think it's wise to mandate change inthe marketplace so that certain users have to use certain kinds ofcars.''   He also called the requirement a ``heavy-handed intrusion intothe marketplace.''   The Bush administration, on the other hand, calls its clean fuelsrequirement ``the most innovative and far-reaching component'' ofits ozone-cutting proposals.   The president would force a portion of the car fleet in the mostseriously polluted cities to operate on clean-burning fuels such asmethanol, ethanol, natural gas, electricity, propane or reformulatedgasoline.   The president wants a schedule for such vehicles, beginning with500,000 cars sold nationally in the 1995 model year, and going up toone million cars in the model years 1997 through 2004.   ``I'm not sure how you get people to buy that number of cars,''Chafee said.</TEXT></DOC>
