DB2's still selling like hotcakes.andP;  And a whole newsoftware support industry is rising up to help you keep up with IBM's fixes.andM;With nearly 6,000 licenses worldwide now, IBM'S DB2 relational databasemanagement software has all but driven competing products from the field andis fast emerging as the industry-standard relational database for largesystems.andM;An even more telling indication of DB2's success is that it is starting tosee full production use at many is shops.andP;  Two years ago, before IBM startedrolling out its regular cycle of DB2 upgrades, the average DB2 license holderwas doing little more than experimenting with the product-rolling some IMSfiles into DB2 and running a few queries against the data.andP;  But IBM has beenworking hard to upgrade the product to full production capability, and justlast month the company announced yet another revision.andM;As a result, DB2 is now running production-mode applications in as many asone-third of the of the shops where it's installed, say analysts who followthe market.andP;  That proportion is projected to jump to one-half or better bymid-1991.andM;Many users and analysts look for IBM to push new releases out even faster, asit endeavors to move DB2 to a distributed environment across its variousSystems Application Architecture (SAA) hardware platforms.andP;  If it does, endusers may be able to solve some of their production and installation problemsin advance.andP;  But life could become difficult for a growing number ofindependent software vendors who have been having a field day selling DB2add-on products to support-hungry customers.andM;&quot;Vendors' abilities to keep up with IBM is a concern to companies like us,who got into DB2 early and= up with a lot of different products,&quot; says TerryMason, database products manager at the Bank of Montreal.andP;  It's a concernthat spills over to  include tools for other database management software,too.andP;  &quot;We're starting to see some pretty complex DB2 environments, withvendors like Sybase [Inc.andP;  of Emeryville, Calif.] and Oracle [Corp.andP;  ofBelmont, Calif.] producing gateways into DB2.andP;  But many of those products areearly releases or beta versions and will take a while to shake down.andP;  In themeantime, will they be able to maintain pace with IBM?&quot;andM;Vendors, Take Your MarkandM;The question of vendor viability will likely become a concern to more usersas IBM continues to up the DB2 ante in coming years.andP;  &quot;Not only is IBM movingfast with DB2, it's basing other key strategies like CASE and SAA on DB2,&quot;says Howard Fosdick, vice president of the International DB2 Users Group(IDUG), headquartered in Chicago.andP;  &quot;Any product written to work with DB2 mayhave to be broadened to fit with all the other agendas that IBM iscopackaging with DB2.andP;  That's going to pose a challenge to all but thestrongest vendors.&quot;andM;But as more and more users begin to bring DB2 up to production mode withlarger applications, they should brace themselves for a mild surprise: Thisphenomenal successful database product is, by itself, currently inadequatefor handling all he tasks of managing corporate data.andP;  &quot;I doubt if there's asingle shop running production applications that's getting by on DB2 alone orwith the DB2 tools IBM sells,&quot; says Fosdick, who also works as a consultantin Villa Park, 111.andP;  &quot;DB2 is a good kernel.andP;  But in any productionenvironment you need a lot more than it gives you.andP;  &quot;andM;The &quot;more than&quot; to which Fosdick refers is the myriad of software tools thatwork with DB2.andP;  These tools fall into four broad categories: on-lineperformance monitors, which, among other things, prevent poorly writtenStructured Query Language (SQL) queries from bringing a system to its knees;tools that automate the tasks of database administrators, such as editing andchanging DB2 tables; end-user access tools, such as DB2-specificfourth-generation languages; and numerous systems utilities, such as dataloaders and compressors, direct access storage device (DASD) managers and soforth.andM;But even if DB2 is, by itself, inadequate to do the job, users can takeheart.andP;  There exists today-apparently with IBM's blessing-a thriving marketof independent software vendors selling DB2 tools.andP;  By some estimates, themarket comprises upward of 75 vendors selling more than 125 DB2 add-ons.andP;  Thedownside is that users, once they have installed DB2, face an additionalround of product evaluation and selection.andP;  They can also look forward to anot altogether insignificant investment in additional software: anywhere from$200,000 for a bare-minimum starter kit to $500,000 or more for a sizable DB2toolset.andM;So far, most users seem to be bearing this burden without undue squawking.andO;&quot;Even a company as big as IBM can't provide all the pieces,&quot; says Chris Dahl,database software manager for First Boston Inc., a New York City-basedinternational investment banking firm.andP;  &quot;I think the independent softwarevendors have done an excellent job.&quot; Dahl says he can't imagine doing his jobwithout the tools that the independents provide.andM;First Boston has been using DB2 for nearly six years and today has severalmajor systems in production applications, including a customer accountsdatabase and an application that monitors stock and bond prices.andP;  Over time,Dahl has built up an extensive DB2 toolset that includes 15 differentsoftware products from eight vendors at a total additional cost of some$600,000.andM;Dahl singles out a product called Workbench, from CDB Software Inc. ofHouston, as an example of how add-on tools help him do what he can't do withDB2 alone, and which he could do only with some difficulty using IBM'slimited set of DB2 tools.andP;  &quot;Without a data dictionary, the DB2 catalog is theonly place you can go for descriptive information about the database.andP;  Butthe catalog is a heavily used file; anything you do to the database willimpact it,&quot; explains Dahl.andP;  &quot;In a shop like ours, with a lot of developmentwork going on, a query to the catalog could take five minutes.&quot; Instead, Dahluses Workbench to extract al I of the information in the catalog nightly andcross-reference it against a partitioned data set.andM;These days, a number of vendors offer Workbench-like products for DB2.andP;  Theyall offer users an organized presentation Of DB2 files and indexes, somethingIBM does not yet offer.andP;  Workbench also walks a user through the creation ofa table.andP;  &quot;With Workbench, you don't have to be an ace DB2 programmer,&quot; saysDahl.andP;  &quot;It's a real work saver.andP;  &quot;andM;Those Exploding Add-OnsandM;With more Is shops putting DB2 applications into production, the market forDB2 software tools and utilities is projected to explode.andP;  &quot;Most DB2 users have been very casual up to now,&quot; says Bill McNee, director of softwaremanagement strategies and services for the Gartner Group Inc. in Stamford,Conn.andP;  &quot;Only when users start to build mission-critical applications from theground up do they realize the limitations of DB2.andP;  Then they turn to theindependent software vendors for a more robust solution.&quot;andM;McNee estimates that users turned to independents to the tune of $170 millionin sales of DB2 tools last year.andP;  By 1992 that figure will jump to $600million a year, he predicts.andM;Today only one-fifth of DB2 shops have any kind of tools strategy, reckonsMcNee.andP;  By 1993 more than half of all DB2 shops will have identified the needfor a toolset that includes a performance monitor, a number of catalog anddatabase administration tools and one or more end-user access tools.andM;And not only will users be spending more dollars on DB2 tools-about $100,000per year for medium-sized is shops and up to $200,000 for large shops-theywill be more organized in their acquisition strategies.andP;  For many of them, akey element of their tools acquisition strategy will be to use a singlevendor, as much as possible.andM;Dow jones and Co. Inc. in New York City for example, is looking for a singlevendor and plans to spend about three times its DB2 license fee on tools anduser training for a new DB2 installation.andP;  The tools portion alone will costclose to $200,000, estimates Anne Stout, DB2 installation project manager forDow Jones.andM;Having worked in a DB2 shop, I have a pretty good idea of what types of toolswe need as a starter kit,&quot; says Stout.andP;  In order to simplify the process,Stout hopes to buy an integrated set of tools and to deal with only onevendor.andP;  &quot;Of course, that depends on finding a vendor who offers all thetools we need and whether that vendor will be willing to negotiate a packagedeal,&quot; she says.andM;But simplification is not the only reason many shops are looking to thesingle-vendor approach.andP;  Analysts such as the Gartner Group's McNee arecounseling clients to meet as many of their needs as possible from one offive leading vendors in anticipation of a possible shakeout among the smallerones.andP;  Vendors that appear on many consultants' short lists include BMCSoftware Inc. of Sugar Land, Texas; Legent Corp. of Vienna, Va.; OnLineSoftware International Inc. of Fort Lee, N.J.; Platinum Technology Inc. ofLombard, Ill.; Systems Center Inc. of Reston, Va., and Los Angeles-basedCandie Corp. along with its new development partner, CDB Software.andM;The sense of an impending shakeout is putting users in an even strongerbargaining position.andP;  &quot;The market is seeing a lot of  negotiating and a lotof creative financing as vendors try to win business,&quot; says Howard Buehler,project manager for database administration' at Union Pacific Technology, asubsidiary of Union Pacific Corp., in St. Louis.andP;  &quot;Software companies realizethey're running a sweepstakes to be the vendor of choice,&quot; he adds.andM;Does the strong push by independent software vendors into the DB2 marketbother IBM? Not at all.andP;  Says Norris van den Berg, manager of strategicmarket planning for DB2, IMS and AD/cycle at IBM's Santa Teresa Laboratory inSan jose: &quot;Our strategy is to make sure DB2 is an industrial-strength engineand leave the tools to independent vendors.andP;  DB2 is such a rich databasesystem, the range of things users could conceivably want is so great, there'sno way we could address the potential market ourselves.&quot;andM;And it's no accident that independent software vendors are prospering in theDB2 market, says van den Berg.andP;  Six years ago, when launching SystemsApplications Architecture (SAA) and DB2, IBM made a conscious decision towork with independent vendors.andP;  &quot;We proactively recruited them, conductingseminars and Qandamp;A sessions, making product information available, even settingup a special vendor's hot line,&quot; says van den Berg.andP;  Today, IBM is countingheavily on independent software vendors, with whom it currently has more than100 business partnerships.andP;  &quot;This is a good arrangement for us and will onlyget stronger,&quot; asserts van den Berg.andP;  &quot;This is going to be business as usualfor us in the future.andP;  &quot;andM;That's not to say IBM won't offer a few DB2 products of its own, such as itsQuery Management Facility (QMF) for DB2, says van den Berg, or that it won'ttry to work more closely with a few select vendors to develop DB2 tools fortasks IBM feels are particularly critical.andP;  Among the latter are performancemonitoring and conversion of applications from other database systems to DB2.andM;Nevertheless, DB2 tools vendors are not exactly shivering in dread of IBM'simminent entry into their market.andP;  &quot;The market is just so enormous in termsof all the things that can be done to enhance a product as complex as DB2,&quot;says Andrew Filipowski, president of Platinum Technology.andP;  Ultimately wecould be looking at 150, 200 separate niche tools.andP;  I think IBM is veryconscious that it just can't fill all the holes.&quot;andM;&quot;We've been selling IMS utilities for 10 years and IBM hasn't felt the needto make its IMS products particularly competitive,&quot; says joe Backer, seniorvice president of sales and marketing for BMC Software.andP;  &quot;I don't see themdoing anything different for DB2.&quot;andM;DB2 Support: Take Your Pick of Products Who's helping to make DB2 workbetter?

incarnation.andP;  The problemstems from the way relational data base management systems-includingDB2--physically store and manage data.andP;  And it's a problem that gets moreacute as a relational database grows in size or complexity.andM;Virtually every organization needs to store data about persons, places andrelated information-the &quot;entities&quot; of  database management.andP;  In RDBs theseentities are expressed in tables.andP;  An employee, for example, is an entity andthe database would have an employee table.andP;  Each table is a combination ofvertical columns and horizontal rows-millions of rows in some caws.andP;  At thehead of each column is a named property or characteristic of an entity, knownas an attribute.andP;  Thus, if  employee&quot; is the entity, then attributes, orcolumn names, could be such things as ID number, name, salary and so on.andP;  Therows are occurrences of each attribute: for example, 1083, Abbott FB,$55,000.andM;For operational efficiency reasons, and to simplify the process of updatingor modifying data RDBMSs like DB2 aren't structured to permit taabales tocontain multiple occurrences of  an attribute in the same row.andP;  An examplefrom an employee  table might  be the attribute &quot;languages spoken.&quot;andP;  If aparticular employee listed in the table speaks French, German and Italian,then the names of those three languages-a &quot;repeating group&quot;-logically shouldgo in the same row.andP;  But RDBMSs do not support such repeating  groups.andM;Repeating groups are defined in such cases as &quot;denormalized&quot; data.andO;Relational database management systems require that all denormalized data gothrough a process  of  &quot;normalization.&quot; Database administrators (DBAS) mustbreak this repeating data into a separate table called, for example,languages spoken, as part of the normalization process.andM;In practice, DBAS create many normalized tables when developing newrelational databases.andP;  They also create indexes that join one table or entityto another table or entity and provide a navigational path through all thenormalized data.andM;This works fine when tables are small, say 50,000 rows.andP;  A query or updaterequest can hop quickly from table to table and through the whole database.andO;But with table sizes of 500,000 rows and larger, so-called large databaseeffects set in.andP;  Each transaction begins  to consume large amounts of CPUtime and disk I/O.andP;  And when tables grow to include millions of rows, RDBMSsbecome resource hogs.andP;  A single application in some cases can require adedicated 309X mainframe in order to run efficientandM;Result: RDBMS trailblazers who thought they had bought a panacea to theirgrowing problems in managing databases were quickly disillusioned.andP;  Says Robert Lulis, database administrator at Hanover Insurance Inc., in Worcester,Mass., an early DB2 installation site,  We followed IBM's lead and normalizedour data.andP;  We created many tables.andP;  Our plan was to standardize on DB2throughout the company.&quot;andM;Lulis discovered that with Hanover's big 10-million-row tables, performanceby the company's  early version of IBM's DB2 was appalling.andP;  &quot;It was so badthat  we had to denormalize our tables to get the performance we  needed,&quot; heexplains.andP;  Lulis ended up creating smaller 2.5 million-row summary tablesthat were an aggregate of data drawn from the  large normalized data pool.andO;Technicians achieved  this by writing COBOL program that could extractinformation  from normalized tables, denormalize the data and place it intonew external files.andM;&quot;We improved performance by 50% with tricks like this,&quot; says Lulis.andP;  &quot;Butbased on our experience with DB2's performance [in the earlier versions] ...andO;transforming a normalized schema into a denormalized schema will be costly.&quot;andO;Lulis adds that once a company has denormalized all its data to help speed upearly-version DB2's performance, the cost of recoding and renormalizing thedatabase system in order to bring up IBM's most recent improved version ofDB2-which apparently solves many of the problems Lulis cites-could beprohibitive.andM;&quot;Once IBM resolves the DB2 performance problems and normalization is a viablealternative,&quot; he says, &quot;a renormalization procedure will have an estimatedmillion-dollar-plus [added cost] within our corporation.&quot;andM;Many of IBM's early DB2 customers think they may have signed on to the newRDBMS too soon and are still waiting for all the problems to be solved.andO;&quot;Caution is the watchword,&quot; says Sue Herman, data administrator at BlueCross/Blue Shield  of Michigan, based in Detroit.andP;  &quot;We've had DB2 in housefor five years and we haven't yet figured out an affordable or efficient wayto implement a complex, high-volume (i.e., millions of rows) claims querysystem on it, she adds.andM;Queries that access data from numerous table rows at once, called setqueries, are becoming important in the '90s as companies build marketingapplications that allow top executives to ask the database for information.andM;DB2 won't become the high-performance solution IBM says it can be if it can'troutinely handle set queries without missing a beat, say customers.andP;  At thisstage, at least, relational database management systems have not built astrong track record of handling these types of queries easily andefficiently.andP;  Whether IBM's latest version of DB2 holds a solution to thisdesign weakness remains to be seen.andM;Citing its own benchmark figures.andP;  IBM continues to insist that DB2 isimproving rapidly.andP;  &quot;We're satisfied that DB2 can handle almost any type ofapplication, everything from simple and complex queries to full-bodiedproduction work,&quot; says Bob McIvor, senior planner at IBM's Strategy andMarket Planning organization in the Santa Teresa labs in San Jose, DB2'sbirthplace.andP;  &quot;Our strategy is to do well  in everything.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
