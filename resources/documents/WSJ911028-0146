The agreement, which was approved by the union'smembership Wednesday, is the first negotiated train crewreductions since a congressionally appointed special boardmade final recommendations on rail labor issues over thesummer.</LP><TEXT>   Transportation industry analysts say the recommendations,once implemented throughout the industry, would eliminatemost of the remaining work-rule restrictions, reduce railroadlabor costs by more than $1 billion a year, and make railsmore competitive with trucks.   James Dagnon, senior vice president, human resources, ofthe Fort Worth, Texas, transportation company, said theagreement could lead to the elimination of 1,650 of the 5,000UTU employees in the southern part of the railroad. Thesouthern tier extends south from the Denver area to the TexasGulf Coast and east to a number of Midwest cities andcontains much of the company's coal and grain traffic.   However, Mr. Dagnon said Burlington Northern expects toinvoke arbitration to settle crew size issues on the northernpart of its railroad, which extends from Seattle toMinneapolis and has been marked by larger crew sizes and moreconfrontational relations between management and labor.   The special board had urged railroads and the UTU to dotheir best to negotiate crew size agreements voluntarily, butallowed the parties to invoke arbitration after Thursday tosettle disputes.   Burlington Northern said it expects to implement theagreement on its southern lines within 30 days. Uponimplementation, the railroad will be able to operate most ofits trains on the southern two-thirds of its rail system withtwo crew members. Currently, most of its trains operate withthree or four employees.   The company will pay a $1,000 signing bonus to each UTUmember affected by the agreement and will offer one-timeseparation payments of $60,000 to surplus train crew memberswho decide to leave the company. Surplus train crew memberswho elect to stay with the railroad would be put on a reserveboard that entitles them to full health and welfare benefitsand 75% of their pay.   Other railroads, including the rail units of NorfolkSouthern Corp., Norfolk, Va., and Union Pacific Corp.,Bethlehem, Pa., said they are continuing to negotiate withthe UTU over crew size reductions but plan to invokearbitration if they haven't reached agreements by week's end.   &quot;Hopefully, they will remove forevermore one of theongoing thorns in the sides of rail management and labor,&quot;said William Rennicke, vice president of Temple, Barker andamp;Sloane, a management consulting firm in Lexington, Mass. &quot;Andhopefully, they will address the mutual competitive threat,which is the motor carrier.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
