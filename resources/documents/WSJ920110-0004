Bob Kerrey of Nebraska ismarketing his idea for shrinking the federal government. Sen.Tom Harkin of Iowa is promoting civil-rights advances for thedisabled. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas has big ideas aboutoverhauling welfare. And they're all for preserving the rightto abortion.   With no single social issue dominating the nationaldebate, the five Democratic presidential contenders havebecome political free-stylers, pursuing a wide array oftopics. It isn't so much that they hugely disagree with oneanother; rather, they are each choosing to emphasizedifferent matters.</LP><TEXT>   Besides the broader issues of macroeconomics, trade,government-business relations and health care, the candidateshope these disparate issues will help define them for anaudience of voters who have only a fuzzy notion of the menwho would unseat President Bush.   &quot;They're so new at this that they're sticking to familiarterritory,&quot; says Robert Craig, a political scientist at theUniversity of New Hampshire. &quot;The debate is fairly narrownow, but it's giving us a general idea of who thesecandidates are.&quot;   Mr. Clinton, for instance, is using his notions aboutreinventing welfare as a metaphor for his views towardgovernment in general. In trumpeting what he calls a &quot;NewCovenant&quot; on welfare and other questions, Mr. Clinton callsfor more government-sponsored opportunities but also for morepersonal responsibility. The governor boasts that he can &quot;putan end to welfare as we know it,&quot; and he offers a simpledeal: The government will help poor people for as long as twoyears, but after that they've got to work.   &quot;The New Covenant will say to people on welfare: `We'regoing to provide the training and education and health careyou need, but if you can work, you've got to go to work,because you can no longer stay on welfare forever,'&quot; says Mr.Clinton.   Mr. Clinton has tried many of these ideas out already inArkansas and is eager to take them national, especially someof his concepts of personal responsibility: no driver'slicenses for high school dropouts or most students withaverages below a C; tougher child-support enforcement,including income withholding for children's health-carecoverage and reporting overdue child-support payments toconsumer credit agencies; fines of as much as $50 for missinga parent conference at school.   Other candidates have welfare-reform plans -- Mr. Kerrey,who served as governor during the worst economic downturnNebraska faced since the Great Depression, established ajob-support program that moved thousands off welfare intopaying jobs -- but Mr. Clinton's is by far the bestdeveloped.   Yet the Clinton approach has received only mixed reviewsthus far. &quot;The idea of personal responsibility is important,but I worry that there are not enough carrots in thisprogram,&quot; says Amitai Etzioni, a George Washington Universitysociologist. Robert Greenstein, director of the Center onBudget and Policy Priorities, adds: &quot;Some people in the`welfare community' see Clinton's plans as an attack onwelfare in general and on welfare recipients. But it'spossible to see it as a creative way -- politically andsubstantively -- to handle these problems. It could presagesome very major changes in approach and direction.&quot;   No less far-reaching is Mr. Kerrey's plan forrestructuring the federal government. As governor, he enjoyedtinkering with government structure, consolidating 89 countywelfare offices into a statewide system, and now he wants tocut the number of federal cabinet positions to seven.   The Kerrey plan calls for three giant new departments,Human Resources (with the current Labor, Health and HumanServices, Housing and Urban Development and Education);Natural Resources (Agriculture, Energy and Interior); andEconomic Policy (Commerce and Transportation). The savingsfrom all of this, he says, would be used to reduce totalfederal nonentitlement expenditures 25%. And though hisproposal raises questions about the separation of powers,Sen. Kerrey also pledges to cut the number of congressionalcommittees and subcommittees 75% and reduce the size ofcongressional staffs 30%.   &quot;This plan is not going to change much,&quot; says Sar Levitan,director of the Center for Social Policy Studies at GeorgeWashington University. &quot;Nixon tried to do it once and nothingcame of it. The problem is not with the number ofdepartments, but how the government is going to be run, andthat's not being addressed here.&quot;   Nor is it addressed in Mr. Clinton's owngovernment-reorganization scheme. The Arkansas governor sayshe would insist on 3% across-the-board cuts in theadministrative costs of the federal bureaucracy.   The two men, meanwhile, have sparred over national-serviceplans. Mr. Clinton calls for a &quot;domestic GI Bill&quot; thatincludes a college-education trust fund that Americans candraw from if they pay it back as a small percentage of theirincome over time or with a few years of national service. Mr.Kerrey, however, regards the plan as a gussied-up bribe.   Sen. Harkin's campaign, meanwhile, is stressingcivil-rights issues and portraying the candidate as acivil-rights groundbreaker with his work as the chief sponsorof the Americans with Disabilities Act, which insures equalopportunities for people with disabilities and moreaccessible public accommodations, services,telecommunications and transportation.   Mr. Harkin, whose brother is deaf and whose nephew isquadriplegic, is conversant in sign langauge and is trying tomold the disabled into a formidable political force.Activists in wheelchairs plastered with Harkin stickers werea visible presence at the Florida Democratic Party conventionin Orlando last month.   &quot;He is the only candidate that has been visible ondisability rights, and people remember that,&quot; says DianeColeman, an organizer with Adapt, a disabilities civil-rightsgroup. &quot;The disabled can be an important constituency --Congress says there are 43 million of us -- and though wehaven't worked as a cohesive force in the past, that may bechanging now as we develop our civil-rights movement.&quot;   Disabled-rights activists last month signaled that theyintend to be a force in the election, with several of themchaining wheelchairs together in Mr. Clinton's gubernatorialoffice in Little Rock to protest Medicaid funding cuts.   All of the candidates have taken strong positions oneducation, arguing that higher standards and better teacherpay are investments in the nation's economy and well-being.Former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts argues that part ofthe &quot;peace dividend&quot; resulting from the collapse of theSoviet Union should be used to underwrite education programs.The candidates all support full funding for Head Start andthe use of federal funds for preschool and for child-careprograms both before and after regular school hours.   &quot;It's surprising how similar these Democrats are,&quot; saysDenis Doyle, education-research fellow at the HudsonInstitute. &quot;They're supporting all the right slogans butwithout a lot of specificity. They're cautious and safe.&quot;   Mr. Harkin was the only Democratic contender to agree withthe National Education Association in all 25 elements of thepolicy questionnaire it distributed to candidates. Mr. Harkinis &quot;the cheerleader of the unions and labor's delight,&quot;charges former New Jersey education commissioner SaulCooperman, chairman of the education advisory panel of NewAmerican School Development Corp., a private foundationestablished at President Bush's request to help support hisown education initiative.   The five Democrats favor outlawing discrimination againstgays and support the civil-rights bill enacted by Congresslast year. Mr. Clinton has spoken out against race-norming,the process of adjusting government job-test scores by raceor ethnicity.   All the Democrats but Mr. Clinton generally countthemselves as opponents of capital punishment. Former Gov.Jerry Brown of California repeatedly has defended his choiceof Rose Bird, an opponent of capital punishment, as chiefjustice of the state Supreme Court even though she waseventually kicked out by the voters, largely on that issue.Mr. Tsongas and Mr. Kerrey support capital punishment only inspecific instances, such as crimes committed by drugkingpins.   Though abortion has been one of the most contentiousissues in U.S. politics, its effect in the Democraticpresidential primaries has been muted thus far. In principle,all five candidates count themselves as supporters ofabortion rights, and Mr. Harkin used it as the centerpiece ofhis re-election battle in 1990. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Kerrey,who have sometimes had strained relations withabortion-rights forces, now have mended fences with them. Mr.Clinton has shifted his position slightly, now saying hewould sign a bill allowing public funding of abortions. Andleaders of the National Abortion Rights Action League, whichwouldn't support Mr. Kerrey in his 1988 Senate race, now saythey are pleased that his health-care plan includes fundingfor abortion.   The issue may become more prominent in the spring, withthe prospect that the Supreme Court might re-examine Roe vs.Wade, the 1973 decision that established abortion rights.Kate Michelman, executive director of the National AbortionRights Action League, says she has so far been &quot;disappointedand surprised&quot; that the candidates haven't spent more timedealing with the issue. &quot;But we'll pressure them every way wecan,&quot; she adds.</TEXT></DOC>
