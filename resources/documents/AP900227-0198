Robert Beevers, a consultant who spent 14 years as a tankercaptain, said the worst move Hazelwood made on March 24 was leavingthe ship's bridge in the hands of a third mate during a hazardouspassage into Prince William Sound.   ``He created the risk of grounding, of losing the vessel, offire, explosion and death to his crew and of pollution thatoccurred,'' said Beevers, who testified as a prosecution expert.   Soon after Hazelwood left the bridge, the Exxon Valdez impaleditself on Bligh Reef, causing the nation's worst oil spill.   ``In my opinion, it was bad judgment to leave the bridge ... atthat location, at that time,'' Beevers said. ``Whether it was oneminute or 20 minutes, it was bad judgment.''   In another development Tuesday, a federal grand jury inAnchorage indicted Exxon Corp. and its shipping subsidiary on fivecounts in the spill.   If convicted of the two felonies and three misdemeanors in theindictment, the company could be fined up to $1.6 million, U.S.Attorney General Dick Thornburgh told a Washington news conference.   The government could also seek as much as $700 million moreunder federal laws allowing recovery of twice the amount of theproven loss caused by the spill, U.S. Attorney Mark Davis of Alaskasaid at the news conference.   Hazelwood attorney Michael Chalos criticized the timing of theindictment.   ``It's interesting that it should be happening now just as we'refinishing the Hazelwood trial,'' Chalos said. ``They waited thislong, why couldn't they wait two weeks longer?'' The trial isexpected to last about two more weeks.   Nearly 11 million gallons of oil were dumped into the pristinesound, killing countless birds, fish and other wildlife andblackening hundreds of miles of rocky shore.   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged withsecond-degree criminal mischief, a felony, and three misdemeanors:reckless endangerment, operating a vessel while intoxicated andnegligent discharge of oil. If convicted on all counts, he could besentenced to up to 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.   In the trial's fourth week, Beevers offered the most directcriticism yet of Hazelwood, giving him bad marks on such actions ashis last-minute arrival before sailing, a hasty decision to divertthe tanker from shipping lanes to avoid ice and transferringcontrol to the third mate shortly before the ship rammed the reef.   Hazelwood's attorneys objected repeatedly to the testimony,saying he is not charged with exercising bad judgment and thatBeevers' opinions were irrelevant. But Superior Court Judge KarlJohnstone allowed the testimony to continue and reprimandedHazelwood lawyer Dick Madson after a pointed exchange with Beevers.   Madson rose from his chair to cross-examine Beevers anddeclared, ``Am I standing here before the eyes of God?''   ``Mr. Beevers, you're not perfect, are you?'' Madson askedBeevers.   ``No, I'm not,'' Beevers responded.   ``And have you ever had someone hired to say you exercised badjudgment?'' said Madson.   ``No,'' said Beevers.   Beevers, who spent four hours on the witness stand and was tocontinue Wednesday, said he is being paid $35,000 for helping inthe case. He retired from the merchant marine in 1987.   Beevers was especially critical of Hazelwood's decision to leavethird mate Gregory Cousins alone on the bridge with a helmsman.   The witness portrayed Cousins as a mate far too inexperienced tobe left with such a task, noting that he had only 13 months of seaexperience on his license.   ``He was heading into a dangerous situation, a situation thatneeded someone with experience to maneuver it, a situation that wasbeyond what you would expect a relatively inexperienced third mateto do on his own,'' Beevers said.   He also criticized Hazelwood for leaving at the wheel a helmsmanwho had problems with steering.</TEXT></DOC>
