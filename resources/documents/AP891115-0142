Gorbachev on Wednesdayrejected claims that reform in Eastern Europe spell the demise ofsocialism and insisted the Communist Revolution ``was not amistake.''   Speaking to a national student conference in Moscow, Gorbachevalso said the existence of two Germanys ``has been recognized bythe world community'' since the end of World War II and even talkabout reunification constitutes interference in the affairs of thetwo countries.   The Soviet Union in the past week has flatly opposed anysuggestion that East and West Germany should be rejoined.   ``Noting that certain forces in the West try to create theimpression that profound changes in socialist countries signify thefailure of socialist ideas, Gorbachev said that this was wishfulthinking,'' according to the official news agency Tass. It did notspecify which forces Gorbachev had in mind.   In a televised speech that ran almost two hours, Gorbachevhammered home to students who he seemed to suspect believedotherwise that ``the October revolution was not a mistake.''   Using a persuasive, emotional tone, Gorbachev extolled theideology behind the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution and condemned``people who are trying to find the roots of our troubles not inthe distortions of socialism that took place, but in its verynature and principles.''   ``We cannot allow dissatisfaction with ourselves, with how welive now, to be transformed into attempts to question ourindisputable, universally recognized achievements and the choice ofsocialism itself,'' he said.   That Gorbachev felt the need to come to the defense of the mostbasic ideological postulates of Soviet society indicated that theyare coming under ever wider attack as the country struggles througheconomic crisis and sees East bloc neighbors moving towardmultiparty systems.   In his remarks about East Germany, which were carried by Tassbut not shown on television, Gorbachev expressed for the second dayin a row concern over Western powers' response to the democraticupheaval in Eastern Europe.   At a meeting Tuesday with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumashe denounced calls for ``exporting capitalism'' to Eastern Europeand said it was ``useless to clamor about victory in the Cold War,about the disintegration of some or another social system,'' Tassreported.   The White House said Wednesday it had ``no apologies'' forextolling capitalism as a remedy for the economic woes of EasternEurope and said the U.S. position should not be offensive toGorbachev.   Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush views thefree-market economy of the United States as the ``pride of theworld and as a good way to reform the economic problems that theyare facing.   ``We certainly are proud of the capitalist system and therewards that it has offered,'' he added. ``We hold it up as anexample to all but we have not tried to dictate it to any of thesecountries.''   Nevertheless, Fitzwater said, all the actions taken by theUnited States ``have been appropriate and not been offensive andhave had the desired effect of offering our support withoutinciting revolution or other actions that would take the processbackward ... We have no apologies or concern with anything thatwe've done at this point.''   As for the reunification of East and West Germany, Gorbachevsaid it ``is not a matter of topical politics. Talking aboutreunification would mean interference in the affairs'' of the twocountries, according to Tass.   Poland and Hungary moved away from single-party Communist ruleearlier this year. East Germany reshuffled its leadership thismonth and, in the most striking reform, opened up the Berlin Walland allowed its citizens free exit. Czechoslovakia also liberalizedits travel restrictions.   Other top Soviet officials joined their president in condemningWestern attempts to interpret the instability in the East bloc assignifying the failure of socialism.   In Tokyo, Gorbachev adviser Alexander Yakovlev said he wassurprised by Western commentators who interpret the tumult in theregion as demonstrating the failure of socialism and Soviet policy.   ``This is an obsolete, archaic way of thinking,'' the Politburomember told a news conference Wednesday. ``We would like to have acommon European house based on freedom. If someone interferes inthat process, we might go back to the time of the Cold War.''   Gorbachev's speech to the students touched on the widespreadalienation from the Communist Party among Soviet youth and theirslack support for the Kremlin's reforms.   His statements appeared at least in part to be a response to arecent poll published in the state-controlled press that found 17percent of Soviet students thought the October Revolution was amistake.   He reprimanded students for ``sleeping through'' the electionsto the Congress of People's Deputies this spring, and warned themthat allowing their youthful energy to lead them into pushing formore radical reform could lead to disaster.   Despite his support for East Germany's changes, rumors thatGorbachev would travel to Berlin to participate in demolition ofthe Berlin Wall are false, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
