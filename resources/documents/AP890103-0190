Even therespected Humane Society of the United States has taken on the verysymbol of consumerism, American Express.</TEXT><TEXT/><NOTE>By KAY BARTLETT</NOTE><NOTE>AP Newsfeatures Writer</NOTE><TEXT>   ROCKVILLE, Md. _ The Humane Society of the United States isurging people to cut up their American Express cards because thecredit institution mailed a fur coat catalog announcing: ``Fur _Because winter is long and life is short.''   ``Follow your heart. Drop your American Express,'' theWashington-based Humane Society told its 830,000 members.   That is but one more confrontation in a burgeoning animal rights,animal welfare and animal liberation movement that has beengathering strength across the nation.   It is by no means monolithic or even united: The majority wouldnot agree with some of the direct action resulting in burnedbuildings, theft of records and research animals, and death threats.   There are large differences about philosophy and tactics. Many,for example, are unprepared to espouse vegetarianism, while othersgo so far as to feed a meatless diet to their dogs and cats to sparethe suffering of a farm animal. It also has closed down someresearch projects, caused one company to drop its cosmetics line,and improved conditions for some research animals.   Consider the following:   _More than 2,000 protesters, led by Bob Barker, walked upManhattan's Fifth Avenue the day after Thanksgiving _ ``Fur FreeFriday.'' There were smaller demonstrations in 66 other Americancities.   _A research scientist at New York University's prestigiousCornell Medical College made research history when she or theuniversity, or both, yielded to demonstrations and a letter-writingcampaign and returned a $530,000 grant to the National Institute ofDrug Abuse for a study of barbituate withdrawal in cats.   _In England, a few days before Christmas, the Animal LiberationFront claimed responsibility for firebomb attacks on five ofBritain's leading department stores, causing millions of dollars ofdamage in retaliation for selling fur. Dingles, the largest store inPlymouth, was gutted.   _President-elect George Bush drew flack for hunting quail on avacation in Texas.   _Police in Norwalk, Conn., are holding animal rights activistFran Stephanie Trutt, 33, of Queens, N.Y., on $500,000 bail as sheawaits trial on charges of attempted murder and possession of pipebombs. Trutt was arrested on Nov. 11 outside the United StatesSurgical Corp., a firm that experiments with dogs and has been afrequent target of demonstrators.   _In December, ``Bloom County,'' a political comic strip, ran aweek of satire on testing rabbits for cosmetics.   _And in Huntington, N.Y., on Long Island, a tray of vegetariandog and cat biscuits, Wow-Bow and Wow-Meow, are baked by anentrepreneurial activist.   The radical side of the movement dates back to theanti-vivisectionism of Victorian England, but interest was rekindledby a 1978 book, ``Animal Liberation,'' by Australian philosopherPeter Singer.   ``At last we're starting to look like a movement, but I thinkanimal rights is in its early stages,'' says Ingrid Newkirk, chiefstrategist and director of People for the Ethical Treatment ofAnimals (PETA), the most radical of an estimated 3,000 to 7,000groups involved in animal welfare.   A PETA spokeswoman estimates that 10 million Americans areinvolved and guesses that the operating budgets of the myriad groupscome to about $50 million. That's not counting the money held inendowments by the established giants, who tend to be less militant.   While businessmen and scientists say they are worried, activistsclaim they have never hurt a human nor an animal. Alex Pacheco, aco-founder of PETA, says arson, property destruction, burglary ortheft are ``acceptable crimes when they directly alleviate the painand suffering of an animal.'' The same goes for sit-ins, disruptionsat stockholder meetings in attempts to pass resolutions to banproduct testing on animals.   Animal rights people say the experiments are the real crime andthat 40 percent of all research animals are used for cosmetic andproduct testing, often as insurance against a theoretical lawsuit,not as safety measures.   ``Do we really need the 48th brand of oven cleaner?'' Newkirkasks.   The blitz against wearing fur is the most visible campaign. Thereare ads atop taxis, on billboards, in subways and buses. Celebritiessuch as Rue McClanahan and Loretta Swit have participated. EvenPrincess Di was commended for her refusal to wear fur.   The fur industry tries to keep the activists off the air.   Richard Parsons, executive director of the Fur RetailersInformation Council, says furriers have been asked not to giveinterviews because they tend to ``shoot themselves in the foot.''Like the time one told a reporter that all American furs arefarm-raised. Not true.   ``We can't threaten to pull our ads, because that's how we sellour furs,'' Parsons says. ``But we're big advertisers and sometimeswe get a pretty good response. Sometimes we can keep them off theair. We try.   ``We don't debate them. We don't dignify them. We don't need todefend the use of fur. It's a matter of personal freedom. This isstill a capitalistic society, and it is supposed to be a tolerantone.''   Sales have not been affected, Parsons says, although the industryis looking to increase the international levy at auction houses toincrease its war chest to combat the anti-fur forces.   ``The American fur industry has had locks jammed, arson, bombthreats and windows smashed,'' Parsons says. ``Giving this movementcredibility gives in to more violence.''   Dan Mathews, a 24-year-old PETA member in charge of the anti-furcampaign, says, ``The fur industry will be the first domino to fall.We are not asking you to change your life, just give up cruelty.''   Besides the furriers, the cosmetic industry, research scientists,and producers of livestock, eggs, chickens, and milk _ ``factoryfarmers'' as the activists call them _ are under attack.   ``So what if we put a few businesses under,'' Mathews says. ``Theslave traders lost an industry, too.''   The anti-vivisectionist faction believes that man has evolved toa point where he can live without any animal products _ meat, milk,leather, fur, wool, etc. They feel that neither the cosmeticindustry nor medical researchers have the right to experiment onanimals; that zoos, rodeos, race tracks, even the household pet isan exploitation of the animal kingdom.   ``We are not saying animals have the same rights as man,'' saysGeorge Cave of Trans-Species Unlimited. ``Sometimes, we have to makechoices.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
