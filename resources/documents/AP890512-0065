Dissident groups have charged LeeChol-kyu was tortured and killed by police.   Police have denied the charges and Roh has ordered a thoroughinvestigation of the case. About 30 students visited the hospitalmorgue today where Lee's body laid, cut their fingers and wrote``Punish Roh Tae-woo'' in blood on placards.   About 4,000 radical student representatives from across SouthKorea attended a meeting of the National Council of Students inTaejon to discuss strategy and prepare for anti-government protests.   Authorities mobilized 4,000 riot police for the studentdemonstration at Chungnam University, but troopers did notintervene.   Student leaders denounced the Roh government, charging it wasplotting to impose authoritarian rule. Leaders called fornationwide protests later this month to topple Roh.   ``We must oust the Roh regime,'' said one leader as protesterscheered and beat drums and brass gongs.   South Korea has been hit by a wave of violent protests and laborstrikes in recent months as radical groups have tried to weaken thegovernment. But the radicals are not seen as a serious threat tothe government despite their violent tactics.   Student leaders in Taejon, 84 miles south of Seoul, called forthe expulsion of the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea basedunder a mutual defense treaty. They charged Washington and the Rohgovernment were imposing colonial rule on the country.   Other speakers charged the United States was keeping troops inSouth Korea to block reunification with communist North Korea. Theycalled for immediate reunification with the north.   ``Let's inflict an irrevocable defeat on U.S. imperialism andadvance the unification of our fatherland,'' said student leader ImChong-suk.   Cheering students chanted, ``Punish Yankee imperialism'' and``Yankees go home.''   Leaders denounced a proposal to relocate some U.S. militaryunits from Seoul to Taejon. They charged American soldiers wouldspread AIDS among the local population.   Speakers ridiculed American soldiers as the ``AIDS legion.''   The radical leaders said they would continue to try to avoidviolent protests, but vowed never to give up their drive to topplethe Roh government.   Some radical students have said they would halt violent protestsafter six riot policemen were killed and 10 others criticallyinjured May 3 in a clash with students in Pusan.   The Roh government ordered a major crackdown on dissident groupsafter the deaths. Many South Koreans, angered by the deaths, havecalled for an end to a recent wave of violent anti-governmentprotests and labor strikes.   Radical students claim Roh is a front for military rule andWashington helps control the Seoul government.   U.S. officials have agreed to a plan to relocate some militaryunits from Seoul to Taejon to free up needed land in the capitaland to reduce the visibility of the American military presence.   South Korean and U.S. officials say American troops are neededin the south to defend against possible threats from communistNorth Korea. U.S. forces have been in the south since interveningin 1950 to help stop the North Korean invasion that started thethree-year Korean War.</TEXT></DOC>
