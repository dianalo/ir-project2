The U.S. currency was quoted at 150.25 yen in late New York trading, up from 148.90 yen Monday. The dollar's 0.9% rise against the Japanese currency yesterday was aided by a sense of relief among market participants after Lt. Col. Oliver North's first day of Congressional testimony. The former White House aide didn't implicate President Reagan in the diversion of Iranian arms sales profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 150.40 yen.    Dealers said the dollar also benefited from Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's statement in Tokyo that he sees no need for the Bank of Japan to act to halt the dollar's recent rise against the yen.    The 150-yen level has long been an important psychological barrier for dollar trading. It also has been a key exchange rate for technical analysts who use charts of the dollar's trading patterns to forecast future moves.    Now that the dollar &quot;has broken 150, the technical people, the chartists, view it as a very bullish (chart) formation,&quot; said Carmine J. Rotondo, vice president and chief corporate dealer at Security Pacific National Bank in New York.    &quot;Now the objective is 152. We could see that in the next week and a half.&quot;    Conversely, when the dollar fell below 150 yen late last March, many traders viewed the move as a bad sign for the U.S. currency. The dollar went on to fall to a succession of 39-year lows against the Japanese currency, hitting the lowest point April 27 at 137.25 yen.    Yesterday's level marked a 9.5% recovery from that low.    The dollar also gained against most other major currencies yesterday. It firmed to 1.8438 West German marks from 1.8373. The British pound eased to $1.6163 from $1.6238.    Traders said the testimony of former White House National Security Council aide Lt. Col. North strengthened the dollar yesterday by relieving some concern that he might implicate President Reagan in the possibly illegal diversion of profits from Iranian arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels. Traders reasoned that the dollar's value would quickly reflect any further damage to the administration and its ability to govern.    &quot;The trend for the dollar is up. The only lid that could be kept on the dollar was the (North) testimony,&quot; said Albert Soria, vice president and foreign exchange manager at Swiss Bank Corp.'s New York branch.    The dollar, however, will remain &quot;susceptible to any negative statements&quot; from the rest of Lt. Col. North's testimony, Mr. Soria said.    The dollar was also bolstered by remarks in Tokyo by Japan's finance minister.    At a news conference following a cabinet meeting in Tokyo, Mr. Miyazawa said immediate intervention in the currency markets by Japan's central bank was unnecessary to check the dollar's recent rise against the yen.    The comment dispelled some concern that Japan and other major Western economic powers might act to halt the dollar's rebound. Several nations, including Japan, the U.S., and West Germany, pledged earlier this year to maintain stable exchange rates.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4.20 an ounce to $443.80 in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 2.6 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $443.15 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, July 7, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
