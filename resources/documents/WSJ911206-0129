Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warns of anotherhardline Putsch, Leningrad Mayor Anatoli Sobchak worriesabout a fascist takeover, and respected analysts saydisgruntled soldiers may take to the streets.</LP><TEXT>   To some extent, the warnings are a display of a nationalflair for the dramatic, a penchant for the cataclysmic. Andfrom some sources, the warnings are politically motivated:Supporters of a central government and a strong union hope tothwart independence drives in the remaining Soviet republicsand discredit Russia's radical economic reform policy.   But other warnings reflect the concern that the currenteconomic mess may provoke mass uprisings, leaving only themilitary able to take control.   &quot;It would be a mass movement by layers of society -- thelumpen masses -- and groups like the old party members orconservative parts of the army could play a role,&quot; MoscowMayor Gavriil Popov said in sketching one such scenario at anews conference yesterday.   Before the three-day coup attempt by hardline officials inAugust, liberals repeatedly warned of the possibility of suchaction to try to unify democratic opposition to it. Now, mostpredictions of an anti-government uprising say it will startfrom below, rather than among those near the top. Withhyperinflation, rising unemployment and continued shortages,food riots could turn into havoc. Military officers furiousover spending cuts and soldiers who returned from EasternEurope to find no work and no apartments then could join in.   &quot;When the people reach the limit of despair, the army --if it is not destroyed by that time -- will have its say,&quot;said sociologist Tatyana Koryagina in an interview inWednesday's issue of the official military daily, Red Star.   Defense Ministry spokesman Ivan Skrilnik said that Ms.Koryagina was expressing a personal opinion and that theministry &quot;doesn't think it necessary to comment.&quot; Someexperts say the Soviet military is in such disarray that itcouldn't lead a coup if it wanted to.   &quot;It would be rather easy to use the armed forces nowbecause a lot of people in them are not satisfied,&quot; saysVladimir Kumachov, a military analyst specializing in thePacific region. &quot;But someone else must push them to it; theywon't start it themselves.&quot;   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev this week used thethreat of another coup to bolster his pleas to republics tostick with the union. Mr. Shevardnadze, who also has a stakein a strong central government, warned that only a stronghand will satisfy the people if chaos ensues.   &quot;The `strong hand' can be opposed only by a strong,organized executive power,&quot; he told the weeklyMegapolis-Express this week. &quot;But that is precisely what wedon't have.&quot;   Others worry that if the situation is chaotic enough,neo-fascists would step in to assert control. Mr. Sobchak,who has just published &quot;For a New Russia,&quot; the story of hisown role in building democracy, said that minimum livingstandards must be maintained to keep people off the streets.Otherwise, he said, &quot;Communists are completely discredited,democrats are also fairly discredited, so the road will beopen for national fascists and national socialists.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
