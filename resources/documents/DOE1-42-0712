The Long Valley caldera, oneof the world's best studied Pleistocene silicic volcanic features, isa prime candidate site and it has been studied extensively by industryand in research programs. A proposed site for this hole near the centerof the resurgent dome is based on geophysical anomalies interpreted asindicative of a melt zone at a depth of about 6 km. Another candidatedrill site is in the western part of the caldera, and is planned to probethe expected heat source there which drives the hydrothermal system andto investigate the thermal role of Mammoth mountain. Because of the wideinterest in the site, LBL was authorized to coordinate and expedite theprocessing and interpretation of outstanding data sets, to integrategeological, geophysical and hydrological data, and to organize a majorsymposium in early 1987, with the purpose of reviewing the state of scientificknowledge on the caldera in light of deep drilling objectives of allpotential participating agencies. The Long Valley Symposium was heldat LBL on 17-18 March 1987 to review results of the recent studies, topresent and discuss models for the present-day magmatic-hydrothermalsystems, and to discuss possible drill sites. Approximately 100 people(scientists, geothermal developers, and federal, state, and local officials)attended the Symposium.</TEXT></DOC>
