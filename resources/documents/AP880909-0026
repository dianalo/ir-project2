In just the last three weeks the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,which regulates the nation's 3,000 Sandamp;Ls, has pledged more than $12billion to prevent the failures of 48 savings institutions, most ofthem in the oil-dependent Southwest.   Half of that assistance was in interest-paying promissory notes,bringing the total of notes issued by the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp. to $10.7 billion.   Members of the House Banking Committee have expressed fear thatregulators will pile up so much debt that a taxpayer bailout of theFSLIC, which gets its money through an assessment on the industry,will be inevitable.   ``It was never the intent of Congress to give an open checkbookto any governmental agency,'' said Rep. Toby Roth, R-Wis., whovowed never to vote for tax money to bail out the industry.   Rep. Stan Parris, R-Va., complained that other types ofassistance offered by the bank board, including various guaranteesagainst loss, are too open-ended.   ``It's like giving my kids my credit card,'' he said.   However, bank board chairman M. Danny Wall told the committeeThursday that the notes are the most cost-effective way ofassisting insolvent institutions. They are tax-free and thus thebank board has to pay less interest than on its other borrowings,he said.   ``These are costs that will have to be paid by someonesomehow,'' he said. ``A couple of months ago we were beingcriticized for not being fast enough.''   Wall was backed by Rep. Richard H. Lehman, D-Calif., who said,``I think you find yourself here today somewhat in a `damned if youdo, damned if you don't' type of situation.''   Other members of the committee accused the regulators of tryingto postpone the resolution of the savings and loan crisis untilafter Reagan administration officials have left office.   The plan ``seems to be nothing more than a massive shell game,''said Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y. ``Many of these institutionswill ultimately have to be bailed out again at even greater cost tothe taxpayer.''   Schumer said the strategy would only ``postpone the day on whichthe bill for this crisis becomes due until long after the membersof the current administration have left Washington and are sittingon a beach somewhere.''   Rep. Fernand St Germain, D-R.I., chairman of the committee, andRep. Henry Gonzalez, D-Texas, criticized Treasury UndersecretaryGeorge D. Gould, in particular, for maintaining that the FSLICneeds no new money, at least through next year.   Gould bristled at the criticism and noted that when theadministration in early 1986 proposed a plan to bring $25 billioninto FSLIC from the industry, Congress delayed action and finallyallowed less than had been requested.   Wall has estimated the cost of cleaning up the savings industryat $31 billion, well within FSLIC revenue projections of $42billion over 10 years.   However, Wall said Thursday that the bank board in the next 30days to 45 days would be increasing its estimate of cleaning upproblems in Texas, where most of the industry's problems areconcentrated. As of the end of last year, it estimated the cost at$7 billion, but since has increased that to $15.2 billion.   Wall is asking Congress to put the full faith and credit of theU.S. government behind the FSLIC notes. He maintains that hisagency has the legal right to issue as many notes as it wants, buthe said it would not issue more than $16 billion.   He also indicated that before the end of the month, the bankboard will issue more notes. In September, he said, the bank boardintends to resolve the cases of another 65 insolvent institutions,bringing the agency's case resolutions to about 100 between Aug. 15and Sept. 30.   Congress since 1982 has extended full government backing tosavings and loan deposits. Wall wants Congress to extend thatbacking to FSLIC notes.</TEXT></DOC>
