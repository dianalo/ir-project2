The giant Hyundai group agreed to let workers at one of its main companies form their own union. But despite the government-inspired settlement of a wildcat strike by 40,000 Hyundai workers earlier this week, the number of disputes in South Korea continued to grow.    The Labor Ministry said strikes were under way at 439 work places by the end of yesterday, with protesters involved in stone throwing, vandalism and beatings. Workers are demanding higher wages, better working conditions and free unions.    Police in the central city of Taejon fired tear gas to break up a mob of 350 striking taxi drivers who stoned government buildings and attacked cars. Police said 47 cab drivers were detained and seven charged with crimes.    Other reports said police also fired tear gas on about 500 students who were demonstrating in support of the drivers. The students fought back with stones, and about 20 were arrested, according to the reports.    In Taechon, 70 miles south of the capital, about 400 coal miners reoccupied a railroad station and smashed windows in station offices and a parked train, newspapers reported. The miners had left the site earlier after occupying it Tuesday night. The Chosun Ilbo newspaper said some miners had beaten a government labor inspector sent to mediate their dispute. At a nearby highway, 400 miners were dispersed by police.    And in Inchon, a port city west of the capital, about 1,000 shipyard workers, some driving cranes and forklifts, clashed with police in the streets, Chosun reported. More than 10 workers and policemen were reported injured.    &quot;Police forces will be used to stop promptly any violent protests taking place outside workplaces, and all those involved will be arrested,&quot; National Police Director Kwon Bok Kyung said in a statement.    Mr. Kwon said police also will step up efforts to identify &quot;outside forces&quot; trying to instigate labor disputes. Police have accused anti-government groups of encouraging labor strife for political purposes.    The unrest started last month, not long after President Chun Doo Hwan agreed on June 30 to accept sweeping democratic reforms, including more labor freedom.    On Monday, as many as 30,000 Hyundai workers in Ulsan clashed with riot police in the sharpest confrontation to date. The next day, the government agreed to mediate and persuaded the strikers to return to their jobs today.    Hyundai management yesterday bowed to a major labor demand and recognized the Democratic Labor Union of Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. The union had been elected by workers Friday but was rejected by the company as illegal.    Hyundai officials said Chung Ju Yong, the founder and long-time chairman of the Hyundai empire who retired earlier this year but continues to control the group, made the concession in an emotional two-hour meeting with union representatives. They said Mr. Chung was pressured into acquiescing by government officials, who wanted a quick solution to the dispute.    One official complained that the Labor Ministry had &quot;severely twisted the arm&quot; of Mr. Chung. But another senior executive denied that Hyundai boss had caved in to goverment pressure.    In any case, the agreement appeared to clear the major obstacle from the path of settlement of a dispute that prompted officials of six Hyundai Group companies to lock workers out on their plants on Monday. The lockout was defended by Hyundai officials as necessary to protect company property and prevent violence. </TEXT></DOC>
