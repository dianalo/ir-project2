Pete Wilson's $7 billion dollar tax increase packageand the &quot;follow the leader, forget the public&quot; attitude of our statelegislators.;    Experts tell us the worst medicine one could prescribe forour ailing California economy is a gigantic permanent tax increase. Equallyunacceptable is targeting the middle class for that tax increase. Wilson isdoing so principally through making the sales tax about one fifth (or $4billion) bigger than it is now. That's $187.50 extra on a $15,000 new car or25 cents extra on a poor kid's $20 pair of shoes. That's also lots more pinkslips for workers.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  The Letters Page  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE BUDGET SQUEEZEBIG TAX INCREASE NOW WOULD BE BIG MISTAKE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     The people I've talked with think the governor's medicine must not beswallowed. Further, they can't fathom why the state legislators who have todecide on the governor's tax ideas are not advocating temporary spending cutsinstead of massive tax increases. Business owners can't understand why ourstate representatives, including our Assemblyman, Chuck Quackenbush, are notunshakably opposing the imposition of permanent tax increases to solve thestate's temporary cash problem.;    Failure to heed the will of the peoplecould cost the governor his re-election and Quackenbush his hoped-for seat inthe U.S. Congress.;    -- Ernest L. Konnyu; Saratoga; IT'S ONLY FAIR TO CUTEXPENSES IN SCHOOLS; Education must share in the economic problems facingCalifornia.;    There is no basis for the belief that the quality of educationis directly related to the cost. The picture of Abraham Lincoln studying by alog fire and writing his lessons on wood shavings because paper was scarceshould not be forgotten. In fact, there are indications that the quality ofeducation declined during the high spending '60s and '70s. There are manyopportunities to reduce expenditures while improving the quality ofeducation.;    Education can be improved without costing money. During thelast decade there have been reports on inner-city schools which improved bychanging their approaches, not the expense. Generally, they did thefollowing:;    (check) Stop truancy and tardiness to extend class time andreduce disruption.;    (check) Stop classroom disruptions by removingdisruptive students.;    (check) Assign homework to extend learning time.;   These actions do not cost money. They can't hurt, and they may improvelearning. Reducing disruption may make it easier to teach in a large classroomand reduce teacher's legitimate complaints about working conditions.;    Thereare ample opportunities to reduce education costs by a fair share. Reducingnon-classroom and administrative expenses can probably provide an 8 percentcut in overall expenses while shifting the emphasis to classroom teaching.;   At the elementary level this would cause little difficulty. There is no reasonthe elementary schools should teach instrumental music. This is an experiencebest provided by parents. Music by use of voice is an important part ofeducation, but this can be taught by classroom teachers. Similarly, art can betaught by the classroom teacher.;    Increasing taxes will not help theschools. The United States has developed an economy dependent on foreigninvestors for growth. Increasing taxes reduces savings and thereby reducesearnings as, meanwhile, interest and profits go overseas.;    Californiansmust begin to live within their means. This includes me, you, and theschools.;    -- Bill Stone; San Jose; HEY, HERE'S A WAY TO SAVE SOME MONEY;The whole budget exercise is one of total futility, based on the erroneousassumption that there is something different about income in the statevis-a-vis income to the feds.;    The first step to take is to abolishcompletely the whole state income taxing structure as it now stands, andrelease all employees in the Franchise Tax Board who deal with audits, andanything else except receiving checks and depositing them.;    The second stepis to arrange with the Internal Revenue Service to receive notice of any taxdeficiencies disclosed by audits.;    The actual tax to be charged should bedetermined by the Legislature and the governor, and the revenue established bysimply taking a percentage of the federal net taxable income.;    This wouldabolish all the paperwork connected with state income tax collection,permitting us poor downtrodden taxpayers to prepare only one return each year,sending the state a copy.;    Of course, this would deprive all the politicos'friends of useless jobs, and we may have to place them on welfare. But thatwould be a small price to pay for simplifying the state taxing structure. Ican't see why it wouldn't work equally well for business. The federalregulations are complicated enough to suit even a personal injury attorney, sothey would certainly satisfy Willie Brown and his cohorts.;    All theLegislature would have to do would be to pass a resolution: &quot;This year the taxwill be 9 percent of the adjusted taxable income shown on the federal return.&quot;How excruciatingly simple and, therefore, how completely impossible for apolitician to understand!;    -- R.E.
