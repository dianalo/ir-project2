In theMassachusetts Constitution of 1780, the Declaration of Rightsestablished it to be the &quot;right as well as duty of all men inSociety, publicly, and at stated seasons, to worship theSupreme Being, the great creator, and preserver of theuniverse.&quot; Although every man was free to worship in his own&quot;season,&quot; still -- worship he must. The intent of thelegislature was clear: to promote Christian reverence andpiety among their constituents.   Amid the proliferating trends of the 1990s, there aresigns that the crusade to reinstate the church into publiclife is making a quiet, insidious comeback. Chief among thesuspect symptoms is the Supreme Court's willingness to hear acase potentially challenging the way in which boundaries ofour secular autonomy are defined. In Lee v. Weisman, heard bythe court this fall, the nine justices were asked todetermine whether the invocation of God's name at apublic-school commencement exercise violated a student'sFirst Amendment right to be free of state-establishedreligion.</LP><TEXT>   The court has not handed down its decision yet -- and maynot until as late as next summer. But some already fear thatthe reasoning governing the decision will portend thebeginning of the end of religious noninterference.   Since 1971, when the court decided Lemon v. Kurtzman,judges have been using the same test to determine whether theintent of the Founders of the Constitution to have Congress&quot;make no laws establishing religion or prohibiting the freeexercise thereof,&quot; was being respected. The Lemon test, as ithas come to be known, mandates a three-pronged investigationto discern whether a publicly ordained practice has alegitimate secular purpose, advances or inhibits religion asits principal primary effect, or fosters an excessivegovernmental-religious entanglement. For more than 20 years,the Lemon test has protected school children from chantingprayers, atheists from taking religious vows, Seventh-DayAdventists from working on the Sabbath, Christian Scientistsfrom receiving unwanted medical treatment, and non-Christiansfrom seeing creches spring out of their town halls.   While not asking the court to overturn any of theselandmark decisions, the Bush administration did call onjustices to abandon the Lemon test, and reintroduce a &quot;civicacknowledgement of religion in public life.&quot; Under this newtest, religious practices would be allowed to proceed absentproof of direct or indirect governmental coercion ofreligious non-adherents. Some minor entanglements of churchand state, such as having the word of God (&quot;in whom wetrust,&quot;) appear on our coins, or an ordained chaplain invokethe name of God in his opening prayer to Congress, have longbeen accepted as relatively innocuous departures from theformal proscription against establishment.   But while such &quot;deeply embedded practices&quot; (as they weredescribed by the Supreme Court in Marsh v. Chambers in 1983)may serve the legitimately secular purpose of &quot;solemnizingpublic occasions&quot; (as decided in 1989, County of Allegheny v.ACLU), having school children at publicly funded commencementservices suffer through unwanted religious benedictionsserves no such end.   If the Supreme Court rules to adopt such a test, it alonecannot be blamed for infusing a newly religious tone into itsrulemaking. Some citizens are intent on inducing Solomonicdecisions from the justices on the most ethically fraught,spiritually sensitive issues of the times. The conservativesweep among religious fundamentalists, the sectarian wrath ofpro-choice lobbyists, even the mounting appeal of suchradical politicians as David Duke, all speak in favor of onething: substituting the voice of spiritual guide, or God, asit were, for that of law.   What explains this hunger for officially sanctionedspiritual guidance? A look to the Puritanic past of thecountry reveals clues. Then, as now, there was a burgeoningsense of religiousness in the land. Just as people today arespread out, often too diverse in cultural backgrounds toshare a common understanding of ethos, then too theproliferation of hostile sects prevented a holistic communityfrom developing. As a result, local boards in effect becamemoral surrogates for the people. These boards provided notonly positive spiritual guidance but also an atmosphere ofmoralizing paranoia that ultimately lent legitimacy to thepractice of witch hunts.   At the famous trial of Anne Hutchinson, the suspectedheretic, in 1637, the threat of nonconformism raised by hernovel interpretations of the faith-works controversy evenspurred the governor of Massachusetts to interfere. Althoughhe acknowledged the difference between civil and church law,the governor nonetheless insisted that his right to intercederested on the state's having established the religion towhich Hutchinson was now expected to conform. He alignedhimself with the reigning Puritan minister of the community,who preached the virtues of the &quot;Covenant of Works&quot; as theonly sure means of salvation. The governor claimed that Godhad willed him to use civil means to effect church ways, andsubsequently voted to banish and excommunicate Hutchinsonfrom the Massachusetts colony. Much like the abortion-seekersof tomorrow, Hutchinson was consigned to pursue freedomacross the state lines.   While we have certainly improved in erecting a moreimpermeable divide between church and state since Colonialtimes, there are signs that government's efforts to infuse areligious tone into the reading of our Constitution'sestablishment clause are becoming more open, more aggressive.   In the midst of a newly awakened movement toward religiousgovernance, the public has shown itself passivelyacquiescent. Perhaps, contrary to the days of Puritanism, itis the dearth of spiritual guidance in their own homes thatexplains the compliance. Soaring poverty rates, the advent ofworking mothers, increased racial and ethnic polarization ofneighborhoods and the fading autonomy of the local churchhave all contributed to a lack of moral influence in thehome, especially for children. Pathetically, lawsestablishing religious parameters of conduct may become thenew moral surrogate for some families in the 1990s.   Exactly what may come of this misguided substitution ofassigned roles -- jurist as spiritual mentor, legislator asitinerant preacher -- is yet unknown. Lee v. Weisman could bethe harbinger of a phenomenon whereby citizens defer toofficials the role of religious guide and spiritual mentor.As in the Colonial era, deciding when government crosses theproper lineand doing something about it -- could pose thebiggest challenge to our democracy in the 21st century.   ---   Judge Kaufman is judge on the Second Circuit Court ofAppeals (New York, Connecticut and Vermont), where hehasserved as chief judge.</TEXT></DOC>
