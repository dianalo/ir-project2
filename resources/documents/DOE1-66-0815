Renewable energy should be considereddifferent from resource energy, and it may be wrong to think the formeras a substitute for the latter. Biomas may rank in the first place insolar energy applications. It is an excellent way of utilization of solarenergy since the amount is the largest and it can be stored for a longperiod. In the field of solar thermal energy application, solar waterheaters, passive solar houses, absorption chillers, etc. are being studied.Photochemical application of sunbeams is an interest subject from thepoint of energy storage. Its final target is to generate hydrogen bydecomposing water with the energy of sunbeams. Another field to be notedis the development of wind power turbines. As regards the applicationof ocean energy, ocean salinity gradient power generation seems to bepromising. There exists no high efficient durable system yet, and itremains a problem for the 21st century. (1 fig, 2 tabs, 4 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
