Results obtained are in good agreement with the reported behaviourof swelling under high voltage electron microscope (HVEM) irradiationconditions. Important features are the decrease in the influence of Tion swelling above 0.05% Ti, increase in swelling with cold-work and decreasein the influence of Ti on suppressing swelling at high doses.</TEXT></DOC>
