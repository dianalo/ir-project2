Innovi and Genentech immediately filed a lawsuit in federal court in Delaware charging Wellcome Foundation Ltd. of the U.K. and its U.S. collaborator Genetics Institute Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., with patent infringement of TPA, or tissue plasminogen activator.    Genentech, as Innovi's licensee, won Food and Drug Administration approval last November to sell TPA for emergency heart-attack treatment under the brand name Activase. The product currently is stocked by 4,000 of the 6,000 hospitals in the U.S., and sales between the approval and the end of May topped $100 million.    The patent award, while expected, gave a boost to Genentech stock yesterday. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, the shares rose $1.125 to close at $27.50. In national over-the-counter trading, Genetics Institute shares fell 75 cents to close at $17.75.    In South San Francisco, Genentech's founder and chief executive officer, Robert Swanson, hailed the patent as &quot;the first in a series of major patents that we expect to protect our pioneering work with (TPA).&quot; Innovi, a Belgian technology-patent firm, bases its patent on the original scientific work by Belgian researcher Dr. Desire Collen.    Stephen Raines, Genentech's vice president, patents, said, &quot;We view the patent broadly,&quot; adding that the biotechnology company expects to seek injunctions to block Wellcome and its partner from making or selling TPA in the U.S. He added the patent should &quot;help sales and help maintain our exclusivity in the marketplace.&quot;    Securities analysts were largely in agreement that Genentech could defend its patent position in court, but less sure on whether it could take the patent to the bank -- as insurance of a dominant, long-term sales position in the increasingly competitive field.    The patent &quot;is precisely what we expected,&quot; said Viren Mehta, an analyst with S.G. Warburg in New York. But he added that it won't be legal issues that determine a commanding market position, but &quot;more clinically relevant issues&quot; such as physician acceptance of the product, short-term competition from combination therapies with streptokinase and aspirin and longterm challenges from second-generation products such as Beecham Group PLC's Eminase, which now is awaiting FDA approval.    Sarah Gordon, an analyst with Hambrecht andamp; Quist Inc. in New York, said the patent &quot;is quite clearly against Wellcome,&quot; which expects to file for FDA approval of its TPA product late this year, she said. This should give Genentech some legal standing against Wellcome, against which it lost a round last year in British patent court. An appeal is currently under way in London.    Ms. Gordon added that Wellcome has said previously that it has a $1 million war chest to fight TPA claims around the world. She predicted that &quot;it will be at least two years&quot; before there is any resolution of the disputed claims. Wellcome couldn't be reached for comment on the patent award or the lawsuit, and a Genetics Institute spokesman declined to comment on the lawsuit pending a review.    Also an open question is whether Genentech's patent will cover the second-generation TPA products that are being developed. Ms. Gordon said the patent &quot;doesn't appear to cover second-generation (TPA).&quot; But Genentech's Mr. Raines wouldn't dismiss the possibility of such long-range protection, saying &quot;it depends on the structure of the second-generation products.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
