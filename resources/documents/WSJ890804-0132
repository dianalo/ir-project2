The program is expected to reach $2.6 billion this fiscal year, up about 8% from last year and up a whopping 70% from 1982, when the nation was in a deep recession and the Reagan administration was trying to kill the entire SBA.    The agency and Congress are scrambling, and sometimes squabbling, over ways to find more funds. But lenders and experts in Washington predict that even efforts to raise the program to $2.9 billion next year still would fall far short of loan demand, which is expected to go as high as $3.5 billion or more.    Behind the soaring demand are people such as Edward Rossi of Morgan Hill, Calif. The 32-year-old entrepreneur found banks closed to him a year or so ago when he wanted to start his California Kitchen Cabinet Door Co. He ended up at First Capitol Corp., seeking -- and getting -- a $300,000 loan with an SBA guarantee.    &quot;I was shocked at how smoothly it went,&quot; says Mr. Rossi, who had expected lots of red tape. He says he paid off the loan within seven months and his 70-employee company now has $7 million in annual sales.    Under the program, the SBA encourages financial institutions to make small-business loans by guaranteeing 75% to 85% of the loan's principal amount. The loans are supposed to go to businesses unable to obtain private loans. &quot;No lender would even listen to me; in fact they sneered,&quot; says Ron Shirley, who got an SBA loan in 1981 to start what has become a successful Pontiac, Buick and GMC dealership in Stillwater, Okla.    During the early Reagan years, former budget director David Stockman tried to abolish the SBA, arguing that only about 1% of all small businesses ever used the agency's programs. While demand for guaranteed loans declined in the early '80s from the Carter-administration years, the SBA survived. And loan demand has been rising since 1982.    Ironically, the loan-guarantee program now is short of money partly because lenders are confident that the Bush administration will keep the SBA. In addition, Congress increased the loan limit to $750,000 from $500,000. And under a new program, companies engaged in foreign trade can borrow as much as $1.25 million with a government guarantee.    Because of the program's growing popularity, the SBA ran out of funding last December, forcing the agency to temporarily close its loan-guarantee window. In March, the agency transferred $200 million to the program from other, under-used loan funds. The trick now is to find more funds for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 without violating government-wide budget restraints.    To be able to back $2.9 billion in loans, administration officials have proposed adding about $500 million in guarantees by taking funds from other SBA programs, such as direct loans for veterans and the disabled. They argue that direct-loan recipients could then get guaranteed loans.    &quot;We believe we get better use of our funds with the guarantee program,&quot; says Edwin Holloway, who recently retired as the SBA's associate administrator for finance and investment. &quot;On the great majority of them, we never lay out any money.&quot; According to the SBA, the net loss rate, or the amount written off as a percentage of loans outstanding, is 3.7% for guaranteed loans. That is lower than the 5.3% rate for direct SBA loans though it's higher than about a 1.27% rate on private loans.    But lawmakers argue that dropping direct loans wouldn't save much money and that disadvantaged entrepreneurs would have a hard time competing for the guaranteed loans. &quot;People are waiting in line for those loans. A handicapped person can't roll his wheelchair into a bank and get much respect,&quot; says an aide to the Senate Small Business Committee. (The SBA also makes direct loans to victims of natural disasters, both businesses and homeowners, under a separate program that's not likely to be cut.)    There is, however, wide support in Congress for increased funding. &quot;I'm fairly confident that the Senate will provide $2.9 billion for the loan program,&quot; says Sen. Dale Bumpers, (D. Ark.), chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. &quot;If the demand for loans exceeds this figure, we may have to pursue additional funding&quot; later, he says.    The House so far has proposed a loan-guarantee budget of only $2.4 billion, but backers are pressing for more. &quot;Haven't we already gone overboard in SBA budget cuts?&quot; Rep. John LaFalce, chairman of the House Small Business Committee, said at a recent hearing on the problem.    Over the long term, he suggests establishing a special secondary market to link institutional investors with small-business borrowers in a way that wouldn't require full-fledged government guarantees. Currently, lenders sell about half of all SBA-guaranteed loans to institutional investors in the secondary market. Rep. LaFalce plans to introduce a bill that would create a federally chartered entity, independent of the government, to deal in small-business loans.    &quot;Over the short term, we'll have to scratch wherever we can,&quot; says Rep. LaFalce in his pleas for more funding. &quot;It'll be difficult, if not impossible, to meet the current demand.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
