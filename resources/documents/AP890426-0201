(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New York's highest court waded into adispute over what is a family Wednesday as it heard a homosexualman's appeal to keep the rent-controlled apartment he shared for adecade with his late lover.   The case being argued before the state Court of Appeals revolvesaround New York City's tight and pricy housing market and thequestion of whether people in non-traditional living arrangements _homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexuals _ have the sameprotection as married couples and relatives.   When Leslie Blanchard died in 1986, his name was on the lease tothe apartment he and Miguel Braschi shared on Manhattan's East Side.   Braschi says he deserves to keep the apartment, with itsgovernment-controlled rent, because he and Blanchard consideredeach other spouses. Their friends considered the apartment the homeof ``any happily married couple,'' according to court papers.   Braschi, 33, said the men exchanged bracelets in 1977 as asymbol of their commitment. He now wears both. Blanchard was about10 years older than Braschi.   Blanchard, who had hired Braschi to run his successful Manhattanbeauty salon, left his lover $5 million.   Since Blanchard's death, Braschi has been fighting eviction. Thelandlord, Stahl Associates Co., maintains Braschi wasn't a memberof Blanchard's ``traditional family unit ... those related byblood, marriage or adoption.''   Under New York City's rent-control law, leases can pass fromparent to child or spouse to spouse.   Braschi has argued that as a ``family member'' he should haveautomatic rights to the apartment even though his name wasn't onthe lease.   ``What we're talking about is a family member,'' WilliamRubenstein, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representingBraschi, told New York's top court. ``What we're asking for is nodifferent from what any other family member would get.''   But lawyers for the landlord said no provisions were in the rentcontrol law to protect ``surviving gay life partners'' fromeviction.   ``His (Braschi's) grievance is really with the law, whichprohibited him and Mr. Blanchard from marrying,'' Dean Yuzek,Stahl's lawyer, told the court.   If Braschi were evicted, Stahl could raise the rentsignificantly for the apartment to ``fair market value.''   Braschi pays about $700 a month for the one-bedroom apartmentnear the East River on East 54th Street, according to his lawyers.Actual market value in that section of Manhattan could be hundredsof dollars higher.   Braschi's departure also would make it easier for the landlordto convert the building into more lucrative cooperatives.   ``We're talking about the right to charge fair market rent foran apartment that is currently occupied by a person who has justinherited $5 million,'' Yuzek said after Wednesday's court hearing.   If Braschi is allowed to stay, his rent increases would berestricted to 6 percent annually on a one-year lease or 9 percenton a two-year lease by the city's rent-control law.   Stahl's lawyers have accused Braschi of trying to turn the caseinto a referendum on homosexual rights.   But ACLU attorney Nan Hunter said the landlord wanted to createthat impression ``to prejudice the atmosphere'' and that the caseis simply about family rights.   New York's lower courts have disagreed on the case. Atrial-level judge halted the eviction, citing the ``time, love andcommitment given by Braschi to Blanchard.'' But the judge wasoverturned on appeal.   Braschi has been allowed to stay in the apartment while the casemakes its way through the courts.   Gay rights activists have called the case the most important inthe nation dealing with non-traditional living arrangements.   ``The case is about individuals who live in families that varyfrom the Ozzie and Harriet mold,'' said Thomas Stoddard, executivedirector of the Lambda Legal Defense Fund, a national gay rightsorganization.   Stoddard said the Court of Appeals' decision _ not expecteduntil June _ could be applied to numerous other social areas wherethe term ``family'' is crucial, such things as group healthinsurance, hospital visitation and inheritances.   New York's Court of Appeals ruled in 1984 that one member of ahomosexual couple couldn't adopt the other to keep from beingevicted from an apartment that only allowed family members to livetogether.</TEXT></DOC>
