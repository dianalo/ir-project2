The soybean case, one of the main American disputes with the12-nation European trade bloc, had been portrayed as a test ofwhether EC agricultural subsidies generally violate internationaltrade rules.   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said a panel set up underthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) had ruled thatthe EC soybean subsidies violate GATT rules and impede trade.   ``The GATT panel was correct,'' Hills said. ``We look forward tothe EC correcting the problems that have been identified.''   A GATT spokeswoman confirmed the panel had submitted a report onthe dispute and said the parties had 10 days to react. Another GATTsource confirmed the report, which was not released publicly, wasfavorable to the United States.   American soybean producers and exporters complained in 1987 thatEC subsidies nullified or impaired concessions contained in a 1962trade agreement. Under that pact, the EC allowed duty-free importsof soybeans and other oilseeds in exchange for U.S. tariffconcessions.   The American Soybean Association has claimed that $1.5 billionin U.S. exports have been affected by the EC subsidies policies.   EC officials were not immediately available for comment.   Hills also criticized aspects of an EC proposal to reformagricultural trade under the latest round of GATT trade talks.   She said the EC proposal to ``rebalance'' its agriculturalsubsidies by reducing them on some products but increasing them onothers ``would not prevent trade distortions, and could reinforcethem.''   The U.S. has proposed replacing agricultural subsidies with morevisible and more easily removed tariffs that gradually could bereduced under GATT rules. The EC has said it would accept sometariffs but oppose eliminating subsidies entirely.   Hills is in Brussels to participate in two days of talks led bySecretary of State James Baker. The EC is the United States'largest trade partner, with $190 billion in two-way trade in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
