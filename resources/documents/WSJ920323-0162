The frightening news story raises thepossibility of &quot;exposing people and plant life to higherlevels of harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun.&quot; Within48 hours of widespread news reports on the NASA warning, theWhite House sent out EPA chief William Reilly to announcethat &quot;President Bush is very concerned&quot; and that theadministration would likely move up the date to phase outchlorofluorocarbons. This triggered a quick 96-0 Senate voteto ban the chemicals as soon as possible.   Does it make any difference if NASA was wrong? Or at theleast, if the others jumped the gun on the agency's tentativeconclusions?</LP><TEXT>   In the course of doing reporting yesterday on the &quot;EarthSummit&quot; scheduled for June in Rio de Janiero, we learned thatNASA is expected to put out a second ozone report any daynow. Joe Waters at Cal Tech, one of the principalinvestigators in the ozone study, told us that the levels ofchlorine monoxide monitored by satellite in January have gonedown significantly. Where the original NASA press releasereported the &quot;highest levels of chlorine monoxide -- 1.5parts per billion by volume -- ever measured,&quot; more recentcitings are down to 0.5 parts per billion. Mike Kurylo, ascientist who supervises NASA's monitoring of ozone byairplane, wouldn't give a precise update on airplane figures,but did say his results corresponded to the satellite work.Mr. Waters warns that in his view &quot;this does not diminish thedanger,&quot; but he also predicts that &quot;there won't be a largeozone hole this year.&quot;   This is a reversal, in tone if not in words, of what wasrepresented as the &quot;alarming&quot; release that NASA first put outon February 3. Indeed, if you read deep enough into theoriginal release, you find NASA saying &quot;the mission is notcomplete&quot; and a &quot;more complete description of all thefindings&quot; will be available in March. But NASA didn't objectto anyone reporting that the sky is falling or to someone inthe Bush White House believing that the sky was falling.   But is it? We ourselves are not prepared to dismiss thetheory of ozone depletion. But the problem hasn't beenignored: An international agreement known as the MontrealProtocol already ensures that these ozone-threateningchemicals won't be produced 10 years from now, a scheduleintended to minimize the cost and disruption of the change.If federal policy makers are going to ask the American peoplefor a crash project at huge expense, as they did with theClean Air Act, they'd better have their science nailed down.The press-release ozone decision doesn't look as if itqualifies.   To understand the degree to which these ozone ChickenLittles are panicking it helps to review the scant evidencethat set them in motion after the NASA press releaseappeared.   As NASA has been the first to acknowledge, the report isnot finished. The famous 1.5-per-billion rating is based onthe flight of one converted ER-2 airplane Jan. 20. Butchlorine rates in the atmosphere are known to fluctuatewildly over the year. Arguing the destruction of the ozonelayer on the basis of one day's, or a few weeks', data is abit like announcing the comeback of retail on evidence thattakes Neiman-Marcus's receipts from the day before Christmasand annualizes them.   Other factors also could have affected the situation. TheNASA release's message doesn't take into full account whatweather conditions prevailed that day, a factor crucial indetermining whether that rate of chlorine would indeeddeplete ozone. As observers have noted, Mount Pinatubo, thePhilippine volcano, was active this winter. Natural phenomenalike volcano eruptions dump gases and aerosols into theenvironment at a rate that dwarfs the damage ofairconditioners or deodorant spray. NASA argues thatPinatubo's chlorine didn't enter the stratosphere.   Skeptics in the scientific community also note that a newreport out of Belgium's Meteorological Institute, acceptedfor publication by the Journal of Geophysical Research,raises further questions. (Its subtitle includes the word&quot;fictitious.&quot;) The authors claim that changes in sulfurdioxide pollution levels have interfered with ozonemeasurements.   To those of us who think NASA's participation in settingscience policy via press releases is a bad idea, a questionarises of just what is going on here. We find it difficult toseparate this incident from NASA's recent problems over itsmission within the Bush administration.   After Richard Truly left his job as NASA head, he told anaudience at the National Space Club that NASA's space programwas &quot;in jeopardy.&quot; Transforming itself into an arbiter of theprobably endless debate over environmental policy would beone way to get the agency out of the dog house and back onthe upside of the funding cycle.   &quot;The reason we went ahead,&quot; says Brian Dunbar of NASA, &quot;isbecause there's so much public interest.&quot; In his view thesystem &quot;worked the way it was supposed to -- we provide theinformation and the policy makers made their decision.&quot;   We just can't buy thisnobody-here-but-us-disinterested-scientists argument.Environmental science has become an arena fraught withpolitical pressures. It is simply not clear to us that realscience drives policy in this area. NASA's Mike Kurylohimself noted that a recent Time magazine cover story on thesubject &quot;played on sensationalism&quot; and that &quot;scientists havemixed feelings&quot; about press releases.   Before agreeing that the sky is falling, we'd like to seemore time spent on the data, starting with the likelihoodthat NASA now believes there won't be any ozone hole thisyear.
