Rick L. Gates is already serving a five-year prison sentence ona state charge of manslaughter by locomotive. The federal termordered Friday by U.S. District Judge Norman Ramsey will be servedconsecutively.   Gates drove three linked Conrail engines through a closed trackswitch and into the path of a high-speed Amtrak passenger trainnear Chase, Md., in January 1987. The accident also left 175 peopleinjured.   Gates, 34, of suburban Essex was charged April 1 in federalcourt with four counts, including conspiracy, obstruction of anagency investigation and two counts of making false statements toinvestigators from the National Transportation Safety Board.   Gates pleaded guilty in May to conspiracy for lying to NTSBinvestigators about following safety procedures and smokingmarijuana with his brakeman before the crash. Prosecutors agreed todismiss the other charges.   The brakeman, Edward Cromwell, was granted immunity from federaland state prosecutors for his cooperation in the case.   The prosecution sought the maximum sentence, five years inprison. Gates' attorney had requested that Gates be sentenced totwo or three years in prison, with all but six months suspended,and supervised probation after he is released.   Relatives of victims said Gates' sentence was not as importantas federal legislation to mandate drug and alcohol testing oftransportation workers.   ``I don't want to be Mr. Gates' judge. I think we need to focuson finding the next 10 or 20 Ricky Gates out there before they killpeople,'' said Roger Horn of Baltimore, whose 16-year-old daughterwas killed in the crash.</TEXT></DOC>
