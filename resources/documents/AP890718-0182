Leaders of the South-West Africa People's Organization told anews conference that Louis Pienaar, administrator-general ofNamibia, told foreign diplomats Friday that 1,900 armed SWAPOguerrillas were in Angola near Namibia's northern border andappeared prepared to launch an incursion. Namibia also is known asSouth-West Africa.   SWAPO's international liaison officer, Theo-Ben Gurirab, saidsmall infiltrations by SWAPO members may be taking place.   ``It is possible that there could be individuals or very smallgroups of two or three in southern Angola or northern Namibia,'' hesaid. ``It is possible. We are dealing with humans. But all ...fighters have been instructed to return north of the 16th parallel''in Angola.   The dispute over possible guerrilla movements came as U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar arrived for three days ofmeetings to assess progress of the U.N.-supervised independence planin Africa's last colony, ruled by South Africa for 74 years.   ``Today (U.N.) Resolution 435 is being implemented in earnest,''Perez de Cuellar said of the independence plan.   ``I want to ensure that there will conditions for the holding offree and fair elections,'' he said in a brief statement upon arrivalat the Windhoek airport from Lisbon, Portugal.   He said ``critical problems remain'' but did not elaborate.   Perez de Cuellar did not mention the allegations that SWAPO mightbe planning to invade Namibia or Gurirab's accusation that Pienaarwas creating war hysteria.   Jacobus Venter, of Namibia's Foreign Affairs Department, saidmilitary intelligence indicated SWAPO guerrillas, in groups rangingfrom 80 to 480, were massed in more than a dozen locations justnorth of the Namibian-Angolan border.   In a letter Friday to the top United Nations official in Namibia,Martti Ahtisaari, Venter said the groups ``were armed, wearinguniforms, and had taken their rucksacks and equipment with them.''   A copy of the letter also was sent to several foreign observermissions in Namibia, including the United States, the Soviet Union,France, West Germany and Britain.   A joint SWAPO-U.N. delegation, with Angolan and Tanzanianobservers, traveled to northern Namibia on Saturday to investigatethe allegations. U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard reported Monday noevidence was found of infiltrations or large-scale concentrations ofSWAPO fighters.   Pienaar also said in a statement issued Monday that ``thesituation was calm and under full control on both sides of theborder.''   Gurirab denied there was an impending invasion and called thereport an attempt by the administration to malign SWAPO.   ``As a result of this war hysteria, several heads of state andgovernment were awakened to be informed of an imminent crisis facingthe Namibian independence process,'' he told the news conference.   Under the U.N. independence plan for Namibia, SWAPO guerrillasare allowed to return as unarmed refugees to take part in theNovember elections, which SWAPO is favored to win after fighting a23-year guerrilla war against South African forces.   However, armed guerrillas are to remain at SWAPO bases north ofthe 16th parallel, about 100 miles north of the Namibian border.   Namibia's South African administration claims SWAPO guerrillasare south of that line but SWAPO's statement said, ``There is noSWAPO military presence south of the 16th parallel or in thenorthern part of this country.''</TEXT></DOC>
