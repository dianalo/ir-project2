(General Electric)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Rucker, David.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>General Electric Aircraft Engines (GEAE) is working on thedevelopment of flexible manufacturing systems that will makefactory-floor debugging processes a thing of the past.andP;  GEAE isemploying advanced factory simulation technology while alsoreducing the financial risk inherent in the development of newsystems.andP;  The company is also speeding the design andimplementation of new plants and processes and advancing thescience of manufacturing simulation itself.andP;  Engineers use acomputer-program model of a proposed manufacturing system todetermine how the system will act under different operatingconditions.andP;  The company's flexible manufacturing systems (FMS)group does simulation analyses for everything from single-processmachines to completely integrated factories, resulting in betterdecisions.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   General Electric Co.
