The official, Allan Wendt of the State Department, said a series of consultations in several European capitals has convinced him of the need for a political meeting to hone the effectiveness of the Paris-based Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. His visit to Norway, where a scandal has erupted over illicit exports by a state-owned company, Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS, was the last leg of his tour.    Mr. Wendt said that his trip was only the start of multilateral consultations on export restrictions that he hoped would lead to a formal meeting, possibly this year. &quot;It's no secret that the United States is much interested in the revitalization of Cocom,&quot; he said. &quot;We think that Cocom collectively can do a better job than it has been doing.&quot;    According to another U.S. diplomat, such a meeting probably would involve officials just a step below ministerial level. Topics for discussion would include ways of strengthening enforcement of Cocom rules, a review of what technology should be restricted and the need for building domestic political support for the restrictions.    &quot;Partly, we need to plug the holes and make sure we're still protecting what needs to be protected,&quot; the diplomat said. </TEXT></DOC>
