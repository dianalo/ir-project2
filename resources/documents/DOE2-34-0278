These simulations were performed to aid in the understandingand interpretation of recent picosecond experimental investigations onmodel chemical reaction systems. From these calculations, it was foundthat geminate recombination occurs primarily within a few picosecondsat all densities considered. This is in agreement with previous moleculardynamics simulations with significantly smaller systems, and with thecurrent interpretation of experimental results. Simulated iodine groundelectronic state vibrational relaxation times range from about 1 ns atthe lowest density to approximately 250 ps at the highest density reportedhere. In addition, the functional form of the decay of the average iodinevibrational energy was observed to be nearly independent of density.This result is discussed in terms of simple gas phase isolated binarycollision models. Various force correlation functions projected ontothe iodine vibrational coordinate were also examined, and indicate thatthe iodine molecule significantly perturbs the local solvent environment.These force correlation functions may be helpful when assessing the usefulnessof liquid phase theories of vibrational relaxation of highly excitedmolecules. Finally, the simulation results on iodine vibrational relaxationare compared with the available experimental data. These comparisonsindicate that the molecular dynamics calculations overestimate the rateof vibrational relaxation over the lower third of the iodine ground electronicstate potential surface, and that the efficiency of V--TR transfer, relativeto V--V transfer, may have been underestimated. The sensitivity of theseresults to several system parameters are analyzed.</TEXT></DOC>
