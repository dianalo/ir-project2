Following the issue of that report,significant changes were made in the scope and experimental protocolof the proposed study and a reanalysis of the design criteria was thereforeundertaken. This showed that substantial changes in the design of theexposure apparatus would be required. The revised study protocol anddesign criteria for a modified magnetic-field exposure apparatus aredescribed in this report. The designs based on minimizing the space andenergy requirements are outlined.</TEXT></DOC>
