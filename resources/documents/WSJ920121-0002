Crude-oil futures prices dropped between 10 cents and 31cents a barrel on the International Petroleum Exchange inLondon. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Februarycrude-oil contract, which expires today, settled 27 centslower at $18.89 a barrel.</LP><TEXT>   But some traders and analysts said the declines were atechnical correction after last week's price run-up. Theysaid the voluntary production cuts -- by five of OPEC's 13members so far -- could help to hold a floor under pricesuntil the oil ministers meet next month. As a result, theysaid, a short-term pricing bottom may be near.   The ministers will meet Feb. 12 in Geneva to decide on aproduction level for the second quarter, which usually bringsa seasonal decline in oil demand. There is a growing sense --further supported by the latest cuts -- that the meeting willbring an across-the-board reduction in total OPEC output,which recently exceeded 24 million barrels a day.   &quot;It looks like OPEC will cut 5% of production,&quot; said JohnHill, a vice president with the Merrill Lynch energy tradingdesk, &quot;and traders don't want to be short.&quot;   Iran and Algeria announced yesterday that they will reduceproduction this week by 50,000 and 20,000 barrels a day,respectively, to prop up prices until the Feb. 12 meeting.That brought OPEC's total voluntary cuts so far to 200,000barrels a day.   That is much less than the volume of cuts generallybelieved necessary for oil prices to hold firm through thesecond quarter. &quot;These symbolic cuts will have to be deeper,more sustained and at least matched by fellow OPEC members ifthe organization is to prevent a slide in prices,&quot; reportedthe Weekly Petroleum Argus.   Even though the cuts to date are modest, the accumulationof them is intended to put added pressure on Saudi Arabia,the OPEC kingpin, to reduce its huge output, recently 8.5million barrels a day. Saudi officials previously havesuggested they would consider reducing second-quarter volumesif across-the-board cuts permitted Saudi Arabia to maintainits current percentage of OPEC output.   Also, there was word yesterday from another Persian Gulfproducer, the United Arab Emirates, that it supportsacross-the-board reductions. According to Dow JonesInternational Petroleum Report, an oil ministry official saidthe United Arab Emirates is ready to cut its own output,currently averaging about 2.5 million barrels a day, to helpOPEC stabilize the market in the second quarter. &quot;The marketis really deteriorating,&quot; the ministry official said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Soybean futures prices fell asprospects improved for Argentina's soybean crop, coupled withperceptions that the U.S. soybean crop also will be largethis year. Argentina's soybean-growing regions, ravaged byrecent flooding, got relief from the rain over the weekend.Traders, who had bid up soybean prices last week, took theimproving weather as an indication that Argentina's cropmight not be as badly damaged as expected, said RichardLoewy, president of AgResource Co., Chicago. In addition,traders are increasingly aware of the gradual shift of U.S.soybean-growing acreage out of the Southeast and Mississippidelta areas, which traditionally are low-yielding regions, tohigher-yielding areas in the northern Plains and Great Lakesregions. This means that over the long term, U.S. soybeanproduction is likely to increase. The price of the soybeancontract for March delivery fell 5 1/4 cents to $5.7375 abushel.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold took its turn in the spotlight,rising sharply on technical factors early in the day, thenbackpedaling to end just modestly higher. After trading ashigh as $361.50, gold for February delivery ended $3.70 anounce higher at $358.20. March silver lost 1.3 cents an ounceto finish at $4.277. George Milling-Stanley, precious-metalsanalyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, attributed gold's riseto technical factors, such as short-covering in Europe.Traders cover short positions, or bets that the price willfall, by buying offsetting contracts. &quot;Local&quot; floor tradersin New York also helped push prices up to levels where theybelieved large, standing buy orders from commodity fundswould be triggered, he added. Stephen Platt, vice presidentof Dean Witter in Chicago, added that yesterday'sprecious-metals activity also reflected traders' sellingsilver and buying gold to unwind their long-silver-short-goldspreads -- bets that silver will rise and gold fall.Prospects of improved gold demand and reduced supply thisyear call for higher prices, Mr. Milling-Stanley said.Silver's fundamentals, however, don't justify its currenthigh price, he said. Although speculative activity sentsilver prices soaring last week, there isn't enough of it tokeep the rally going, he said, predicting a correction.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices continued to fall sharply.Juice for March delivery ended at $1.4505 a pound, down 4.1cents. Orange juice prices have fallen more than 13 cents inthe past week. Prices had run up on the possibility of aFlorida freeze, but because temperatures didn't fall enoughto damage the orange crop, traders liquidated their longpositions by selling offsetting contracts, said Mr. Platt ofDean Witter. Also contributing to the weakness have beenreports from processors that indicate the orange harvest isexceeding government forecasts, he added. Prices at currentlevels could begin to receive some support from buying byprocessors, he predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
