Host government regulation was able to attract entries byMNCs and reduce their level of direct contractual costs for transfers,but also encouraged more unregulated internal transmission within MNCorganizations. The internalization of imperfect markets for intangiblemarketing and technological advantages avoided stricter host regulations,but simultaneously increased policy conflicts with governments. The processof technology transfer by MNCs became more politicized and negotiablein the industry during the 1970s. The costs of transfers were determinedmore by organizational and bargaining power factors than by economicprocesses. Government regulation reduced royalty payments and restrictivebusiness practices in technology licensing agreements, but host nationswere still dependent on imports and new products from MNCs. The bargainingposition of host governments improved as competition among oligopolisticMNCs increased and pharmaceutical technology matured. More investmentsin local raw material manufacturing were stimulated, and internal transferpricing manipulation was reduced by government regulations.</TEXT></DOC>
