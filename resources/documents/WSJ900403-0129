The 101stCongress is the one that now gets to clean up the messproduced by the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration &quot;reform&quot; of 1986.   A good place to start would be to repeal the bill'sprovision for &quot;employer sanctions,&quot; which is, we are nowlearning, a synonym for harassment. This is the law thatfines employers up to $10,000 and six months in jail forhiring an &quot;illegal&quot; alien. Last week the General AccountingOffice released a study concluding that the provision hadcaused &quot;widespread discrimination&quot; against workers,especially Hispanics. Rather than play immigrant cop, manyemployers avoid the hassle and refuse to hireSpanish-sounding or -looking Americans. This echoes similarfindings by studies in New York and California.   In defending the law, Senator Alan Simpson says there maybe discrimination but denies it is &quot;widespread.&quot; We'd like tosee him parse that distinction for Hispanics needing a job.As an arm of Congress, the GAO tends to go easy on theMembers' handiwork, but in this case it couldn't ignore thefacts.   The GAO surveyed a random sample of 9,491 employers andestimated that 19% began to discriminate as a result ofSimpson-Mazzoli. About 10% discriminated on the basis ofphysical appearance or accent, and another 9% were onlyhiring native-born citizens. The GAO extrapolates that891,000 employers &quot;of the 4.6 million in the populationsurveyed reported beginning discriminatory practices becauseof the law.&quot; Sure sounds &quot;widespread&quot; to us.   Yet this probably understates any discrimination, since noone likes to admit to prejudice. Worse, the discriminationwas most pronounced in areas with the largest Hispanic andAsian populations -- 29% of employers in Los Angeles, forexample. So the law does its worst precisely where racialcomity is most important.   The law was already notorious for harassing employers. Bylast September, the U.S. Immigration Service had assessed $17million in fines for 3,500 cases of hiring illegals and36,000 cases of failing to fill out INS paperwork. Albertoand Estela Fernandez have been fined $18,000 for not fillingout INS forms for their San Antonio maid service. &quot;I feellike I'm living in a communist country where the governmentis constantly looking over my shoulder,&quot; Mr. Fernandez toldthe Journal's Alfredo Corchado recently.   Incredibly, in light of this record, Mr. Simpson says hewon't work to repeal the sanctions. Instead, he wants toimpose another layer of watchman government -- specifically,to &quot;improve our present document system.&quot; That means anational identity card. Mr. Simpson understands the Orwellianovertones, so he doesn't call it that. But what else to calla card that would be required before anyone could be hired?In floating the same idea recently, INS Commissioner GeneMcNary didn't shrink from calling it a national I.D.   The Social Security card has expressly never been allowedas an I.D. for civil-liberties reasons. Yet Mr. Simpson wantsto create a new national citizens catalog that bureaucratswill always find more uses for. Anyone who spoke with anaccent or looked swarthy would be advised to carry this&quot;passcard&quot; everywhere, just in case the immigrant policedoubted his citizenship. Are we so threatened by Mexicanmaids now that we want to tolerate such illiberal means?   Anyone who visits the 1,990-mile U.S.-Mexican border knowsthat blocking illegal immigration is a practicalimpossibility. The only real solution is to promote economicgrowth in Mexico. One way to do that is to endorse theSalinas government's brave decision to work toward aU.S.-Mexican free-trade agreement. Unlike our experiment withemployer sanctions, free trade violates neither human dignitynor the admirable American spirit of tolerance.</TEXT></DOC>
