First, consider the good that the commission iscapable of performing on this subject.   Yesterday, special rapporteur on Iraqi human rights Maxvan der Stoel, a Dutchman, presented what could be thestrongest report of human-rights violations in the history ofthis commission. He concludes &quot;that the violations of humanrights which have occurred are so grave and of such a massivenature that since the Second World War few parallels can befound.&quot; Saddam's men poured toxic materials on torturewounds; the Ba'ath Party's modus operandi, the report notes,includes rape.</LP><TEXT>   Against this stark reporting, now consider how thecommission itself is conducting its affairs. Before thissession the commission completed one &quot;reform&quot; that the NewYork-based Security Council has been asked to contemplate:Despite a &quot;no&quot; vote from America's beleagueredrepresentative, Morris Abram, the group expanded its numbersto 53 from 43 to give Third World countries more of a say onatrocities (most of which they commit). They in turn aretaking up an agenda that includes evaluating the human-rightsstatus of Cuba, Burma, Iran and of course Iraq. Their firstact was to name Iran as the group's vice-chair.   The program includes a day in which the commission reviews&quot;detention or imprisonment, torture and disappearance.&quot; Butthe member nations that provide judges to preside over thisreview include: Iraq, where Ba'athist soldiers are kickingShia heads into the dirt in the country's southernmarshlands; Iran, which is persecuting its Baha'i minority;and Cuba, which earlier this year shot and wounded childrenfleeing through the cactus fields in an attempt to defect tothe U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay. China is also on this board,despite its Tiananmen prisoners.   Chinese Ambassador Fan Guoxiang contributed to themeeting's tone by saying that &quot;it is not proper for anycountry to figure itself as a world judge in theinternational human-rights field.&quot;   One can write off the commission as a mere debatingsociety. But it is obviously also capable of bringing theworld important news.   All the more necessary, then, that the body return to asounder course. The commission derives its prestige from thesupport of powers such as Japan, Germany and the U.S. Itspotential is great. The new leadership of East Europeancountries, such as Czechoslovakia or Bulgaria, come to Genevato see what world standards are for right and wrong treatmentof its citizens. Instead, items such as the &quot;Right toDevelopment&quot; take up much of the Geneva agenda.   Yesterday's horrifying report on Iraq suggests that thereis indeed a need for what the commission purports to be. Butif the U.N. is to be taken seriously, agencies with the highvisibility of the Human Rights Commission will have to make amuch greater effort to act seriously.</TEXT></DOC>
