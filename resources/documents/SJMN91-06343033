The Warriors made itinteresting by playing the last four minutes as if their hands had just comeout of cold storage, but they had enough to hold off the Sacramento Kings124-120.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  OWENS HURTS KINGSWARRIORS DEFEAT RICHMOND'S TEAM  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     Yes, this was the first game for Richmond as an opponent of the Warriors.He didn't play in the contest Nov. 2, the day after the shocker trade when theKings lost 153-91. With 29 points, Richmond wasn't totally responsible for the58-point improvement, although Warriors Coach Don Nelson seemed to advancethat theory.;   &quot;The game boiled down to what a great trade this was for bothteams,&quot; Nelson gushed. &quot;Isn't that the way it's supposed to be.;   &quot;Mitch wasright. It's good to get this over with. What a great game he played tonight.He made shots. He was special.;   &quot;The second terrific player was Billy Owens.We get real used to watching Tim (Hardaway) and Chris (Mullin) play so well,but Billy has taken that next step and is beginning to blossom.&quot;;   Owens, therookie obtained in the trade for Richmond, enjoyed his best game as a pro. Hereally enjoyed it. Season highs with 17 points, eight field goals, 14rebounds, five assists and 39 minutes. During one span, Owens made sevenstraight shots.;   &quot;I think that ovation was very good,&quot; Owens said. &quot;I gavehim a couple of claps myself.;   &quot;I'm glad I came out and played a decentgame. If I came out and played bad, that might have bothered me.&quot;;   Mullin,with 35 points, and Hardaway with 28 points and a season-high 14 assists, alsoplayed a decent game. Well, more than decent.;   Nelson used everyone exceptGen. Schwarzkopf and the Light Brigade against Richmond. Mario Elie was thefirst to confront his former teammate defensively. Then came SarunasMarciulionis. And Vincent Askew. Finally, in the fourth quarter with a16-point lead dissipating by the second, the 6-foot Hardaway took over onRichmond, who is 6-5.;   &quot;I took him to the paint (for a basket) right away,&quot;Richmond said. &quot;I told him I was going to score off him. He was talking noiseon me. He told me it was tough down there. I said, 'Yeah, for you.' &quot;;  Richmond's baby hook brought the Kings to within 116-110 with 3:56 to go. AndLionel Simmons cut it to 116-112 with a layup over Marciulionis, who hadmissed a shot on the other end.;   Mullin countered by following his ownmissed shot, the Warriors' first field goal in 5 1/2 minutes. And, afterRichmond missed a jumper forced over the smaller Hardaway, Mullin convertedtwo free throws for a 120-112 lead with 2:43 to go.;   Try as they might, andthey tried mightily by hitting 17 of their 22 shots in the fourth quarter, theKings couldn't make up that deficit That's why they remain last in the PacificDivision, which is currently topped by the Warriors.;   &quot;They just ran out oftime,&quot; Nelson said. &quot;I was worried there.&quot;; SACRAMENTO    (120);       MinFG/AT/ARAPFTPSimmons         43 10-20 2-2 9 5 2 22; Tisdale         4313-18 1-2 6 0 3 27; Causwell        20   0-1 1-2 7 0 1 1; Richmond        4713-21 1-2 5 7 5 29; Webb            37  9-15 2-2 3 6 0 22; Bonner          32 8-12 3-3 5 1 5 19; Hopson          7    0-1 0-0 1 0 0 0; Les             11  0-0 0-0 1 6 2 0; Totals         240 53-88 10-13 37 25 18 120; ...; GOLDENSTATE  (124);        MinFG/AT/AR APFTPElie            10   0-3 0 0-1  1 2 0;Mullin          42 14-21 6-6 6  3 1 35; Hill            17   4-9 0-0 4  1 2 8;Hardaway        45 12-22 2-2 1 14 1 28; Owens           39  8-12 1-4 14 5 217; Marciulionis    36  6-14 9-9 6  3 3 21; Higgins         18   3-9 1-2 6  11 7; Askew           14   1-5 2-2 4  0 0 4; Tolbert         12   2-4 0-0 3  02 4; Alexander       7    0-1 0-0 1  0 2 0; Totals         240 50-100 21-25 4628 16 124; Sacramento  30 19 35 36 --120; Golden St.  35 27 32 30 --124;     FG %  --    GS  GS  .500.
