The role of Grace Kelly, who after some hesitation threw her support behind the town's only courageous man, is being played by the American public. It has just spent the last week watching and admiring Lt. Col. North as he single-handedly stood up for the Constitution against the commander in chief pretenders of Congress.    What part is Ronald Reagan playing? Gary Cooper tried without success to round up deputies for help. He went to the church, where the townspeople were gathered. The mayor told them the marshal was a &quot;mighty brave man, a good man.&quot; Then the mayor left town, leaving Gary Cooper to face the outlaws alone. Mr. Reagan also has ducked the duties of his office. That duty was to stand up to overbearing congressional meddling in his foreign-affairs power. He just cut out. Lt. Col. North noted in his opening statement that &quot;the president has not asserted his prerogatives and you have been permitted to make the rules.&quot; Col. North was left to face his inquisitors without support from the administration.    Lt. Col. North has said many wise things about separation of powers and foreign policy, though it's too bad that President Reagan didn't say them from the first. The liberals are now admitting that Lt. Col. North has great stage presence but are arguing that the public supports the man but not his policies -- where have we heard that before? His message struck a chord because some understanding of the unconstitutional usurpation by Congress of the executive's foreign-policy powers is necessary to explain the Iran-Contra &quot;scandal.&quot;    Lt. Col. North suggested that Congress should investigate itself. &quot;There is not much chance that you will conclude at the end of these hearings that the Boland amendments and your frequent policy changes were unwise, or that your restrictions should not have been imposed on the executive branch.    &quot;It is also difficult to comprehend that my work at the NSC -- all of which was approved and carried out in the best interests of our country -- has led to two massive parallel investigations staffed by more than 200 people. It is mind-boggling to me that one of those investigations is criminal and that you have attempted to criminalize policy differences between co-equal branches of government and the executive's conduct of foreign affairs.&quot;    Without trying to justify the Iranian arms-for-hostages debacle, Lt. Col. North explained how Congress drove the executive branch to run the Contra operations out of basement offices and commercial intermediaries. We are as dubious as anyone else of a secret fund managed by the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, but how did this happen?    The Boland amendments said that the Pentagon and CIA no longer could use any appropriated funds to aid the Contras. So if the president wanted to keep the Contras alive until congressional funding resumed, it's no surprise that an overworked National Security Council staffer was left to do the work that would have kept much of the CIA busy. &quot;Plain and simple,&quot; Lt. Col. North told the congressmen, &quot;you are to blame because of the fickle, vacillating, unpredictable, on-again, off-again policy toward the Nicaraguan democratic resistance.&quot;    President Reagan should have said from the beginning exactly what Lt. Col. North has been saying the past week. By now it is obvious that President Reagan yielded too much to Congress when he accepted the vaguely worded Boland amendments. If he had vetoed Boland, we might have got the constitutional showdown several years ago that Lt. Col. North describes nearby. Instead, the battle between the executive and legislature was not joined by the executive branch until last week by a Marine seconded to the NSC. Lt. Col. North is paying for President Reagan's lapse; Lawrence Walsh may try to extract the next pound of flesh in a criminal court.    The points Lt. Col. North scored about separation of powers are something for the next president to remember. For now, Ronald Reagan's task is to repair the office. He could start by realizing that it is not enough to say, as he told Lt. Col. North, &quot;I just didn't know&quot; about the diversion. What President Reagan should have said then and should say now is that even though he didn't know about the diversion, he will stand behind his staff.    Instead, Mr. Reagan is trying to save his own skin, just like the mayor in &quot;High Noon.&quot; President Reagan has bigger responsibilities than this. It's time he started thinking about them. </TEXT></DOC>
