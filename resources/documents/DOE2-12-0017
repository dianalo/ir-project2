Supernatant is electron-beam irradiatedafter microbiologically treated, and then treated microbiologically again.Based this method, by irradiation of 10 kGy, chemical oxygen demand (COD)in supernatant can be decreased lower than 30 ppm. Moreover, electron-beamirradiation induces remarkable decolorization and deodorization.</TEXT></DOC>
