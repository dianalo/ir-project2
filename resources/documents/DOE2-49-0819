These patterns display thevariation of the diffracted-beam intensity as a function of the angleof the incident electrons. The conditions of the experiments are thoseof reflection high-energy electron diffraction at near grazing incidence.The techniques are: surface convergent-beam diffraction, a surface analogueof the Tanaka method and a modified double-rocking scheme. Experimentalresults are presented for diffraction from surfaces of MgO and MoS{sub2}. The authors anticipate that surface zone-axis patterns (surface ZAPs)will become established as an important tool for surface characterization,especially when used in conjunction with high-resolution surface imagingand surface energy loss spectroscopy; surface ZAPs may be expected toplay, in surface analysis, a role analogous to that played by convergent-beamdiffraction in normal transmission electron microscopy. 24 references,16 figures.</TEXT></DOC>
