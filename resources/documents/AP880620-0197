Asim Nasser-Zia, with the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan,said saturation bombing began Sunday on Afghan resistance positionsaround the Zabul provincial capital of Kalat, about 210 miles southof the Afghan capital of Kabul.   A rebel report reaching Islamabad on Monday claims theguerrillas repulsed Afghan government attempts to reinforce lessthan 400 troops in a fort on the outskirts of Kalat, which lies onthe strategic highway linking Kabul with Kandahar, the country'ssecond-largest city.   The guerrillas said they took Kalat over the weekend, scoringtheir first urban victory of the 8-year-old war.   In other developments, a Pakistani journalist traveling withAfghan guerrillas died in fighting with Marxist government troopsnear Afghanistan's second-largest city, the reporter's family saidMonday.   There also were reports of a U.S. congressman's foray across theborder and an exchange of Soviet prisoners of war for Afghanguerrillas.   U.S. Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, a staunch supporter of theguerrillas, slipped into Afghanistan during the first week of Juneto pose for CBS News' 60 Minutes, said an informed source oncondition he not be identified.   Wilson's one-day foray took him less than 12 miles into easternAfghanistan. He also spent four days in the region in February 1987.   Irshad Ahmed, a 25-year-old Pakistani reporter for theEnglish-language opposition daily The Muslim, died Saturday nearKandahar, a family member confirmed.   He is the first Pakistani journalist to die covering the war. Atleast seven Western journalists have been killed.   Ahmed reportedly was killed when Afghan troops opened fire onguerrillas near Kandahar Airport, southeast of the city, saidMushtaq Ahmed, an assistant editor for the Muslim. He is notrelated to the reporter.   Kandahar, about 310 miles southwest of Kabul, the capital, hasbeen under siege by the Moslem rebels for the past four weeks.Western diplomats said fierce fighting delayed a planned withdrawalof Soviet troops from that city earlier this month under terms ofthe April 14 accord signed in Geneva.   A guerrilla group reported swapping a Soviet lieutenant Fridaynear Kandahar for seven guerrillas, including a commander and afighter from an unidentified Arab country who was captured fiveyears ago.   Sulamain Shah, with the Ittehad-i-Islami, a fundamentalist groupwithin the seven-party rebel alliance, said the Soviet officer wascaptured this year. The Soviet Union claims 311 of its soldiers aremissing in Afghanistan.   Earlier, the alliance said Soviet prisoners would remain inguerrilla hands to be used in future negotiations should AfghanPresident Najib or other high-ranking Afghan government membersseek asylum in East Bloc countries.   Resistance leaders seeking to establish a government insideAfghanistan announced their 14-member Cabinet on Sunday, whichcontained both moderates and fundamentalists.

The vice president, Dr. Zabihullah Mojadiddi, is agraduate of the University of Hawaii and a member of the moderateNational Liberation Front.
