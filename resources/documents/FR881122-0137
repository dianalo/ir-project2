Write to the appropriateSystem Manager below for a list of current locations.categories of individuals covered by the system:Individuals covered by this system are those who provide information oropinions that are useful in evaluating programs or activities of the NIH,other persons who have participated in or benefited from NIH programs oractivities; or other persons included in evaluation studies for purposesof comparison. Such individuals may include (1) participants in researchstudies; (2) applicants for and recipients of grants, fellowships, traineeshipsor other awards; (3) employees, experts and consultants; (4) members ofadvisory committees; (5) other researchers, health care professionals,or individuals who have or are at risk of developing diseases or conditionsstudied by NIH; (6) persons who provide feedback about the value or usefulnessof information they receive about NIH programs, activities or researchresults; (7) persons who have received Doctorate level degrees from U.S.institutions.categories of records in the system:This umbrella system of records covers a varying number of separate setsof records used in different evaluation studies. The categories of recordsin each set depend on the type of program being evaluated and the specificpurpose of the evaluation. In general, the records contain two types ofinformation: (1) Information identifying subject individuals, and (2) informationwhich enables NIH to evaluate its programs and services. (1) Identifying information usually consists of a name and address, butit might also include a patient identification number, grant number, SocialSecurity Number, or other identifying number as appropriate to the particulargroup included in an evaluation study, or (2) Information used for evaluation varies according to the program evaluated.Categories of evaluative information include personal data and medicaldata on participants in clinical and research programs; personal data,publications, professional achievements and career history of researchers;and opinions and other information received directly from individuals inevaluation surveys and studies of NIH programs. The system does not include any master list, index or other central meansof identifying all individuals whose records are included in the varioussets of records covered by the system.authority for maintenance of the system:Authority for this system comes from the following general authoritiesregarding the establishment of the National Institutes of Health, its generalauthority to conduct and fund research and to provide training assistance,and its general authority to maintain records in connection with theseand its other functions (42 U.S.C. 203, 241, 2891-1 and 44 U.S.C. 3101).purpose of the system: This system supports evaluation of the policies, programs, organization,methods, materials, activities or services used by NIH in fulfilling itslegislated mandate for (1) conduct and support of biomedical research intothe causes, prevention and cure of diseases; (2) support for training ofresearch investigators; (3) communication of biomedical information.This system is not used to make any determination affecting the rights,benefits or privileges of any individual. routine uses of records maintained in the system, including categoriesof users and the purposes of such uses:1. Disclosure may be made to HHS contractors and collaborating researchers,organizations, and State and local officials for the purpose of conductingevaluation studies or collecting, aggregating, processing or analyzingrecords used in evaluation studies. The recipients are required to protectthe confidentiality of such records. 2. Disclosure may be made to organizations deemed qualified by the Secretaryto carry out quality assessments, medical audits or utilization review.3. Disclosure may be made to a congressional office from the record ofan individual in response to an inquiry from the congressional office madeat the request of that individual.policies and practices for storing, retrieving, accessing, retaining, anddisposing of records in the system:storage:Data may be stored in file folders, bound notebooks, or computer-accessiblemedia (e.g., magnetic tapes or discs).retrievability:Information is retrieved by name and/or participant identification numberwithin each evaluation study. There is no central collection of recordsin this system, and no central means of identifying individuals whose recordsare included in the separate sets of records that are maintained for particularevaluation studies. safeguards:A variety of safeguards is implemented for the various sets of recordsin this system according to the sensitivity of the data each set contains.Information already in the public domain, such as titles and dates of publications,is not restricted. However, sensitive information, such as personal ormedical history or individually identified opinions, is protected accordingto its level of sensitivity. Records derived from other systems of recordswill be safeguarded at a level at least as stringent as that required inthe original systems. Minimal safeguards for the protection of informationwhich is not available to the general public include the following: 1. Authorized Users: Regular access to information in a given set of recordsis limited to NIH or to contractor employees who are conducting, reviewingor contributing to a specific evaluation study. Other access is grantedonly on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the restrictions requiredby the Privacy Act (e.g., when disclosure is required by the Freedom ofInformation Act), as authorized by the system manager or designated responsibleofficial. 2. Physical Safeguards: Records are stored in closed or locked containers,in areas which are not accessible to unauthorized users, and in facilitieswhich are locked when not in use. Records collected in each evaluationproject are maintained separately from those of other projects. Sensitiverecords are not left exposed to unauthorized persons at any time. Sensitivedata in machine-readable form may be encrypted. 3. Procedural Safeguards: Access to records is controlled by responsibleemployees and is granted only to authorized individuals whose identitiesare properly verified. Data stored in computers is accessed only throughthe use of keywords known only to authorized personnel. Contracts for operationof this system of records require protection of the records in accordancewith these safeguards; NIH project and contracting officers monitor contractorcompliance. These practices are in compliance with the standards of chapter 45-13 ofthe HHS General Administration Manual, supplementary chapter PHS hf: 45-13,and Part 6, Systems Security, of the HHS ADP Systems Manual.retention and disposal:Studies, analyses, reports, and statistical compilations created or collectedin evaluation of NIH mission-related activities are scheduled for permanentretention by the National Archives as part of the historical record ofthe NIH, as provided by the NIH Records Control Schedule, section 1100-C-2.Working papers, extra copies, or records not used in evaluations of majorprograms of the NIH or any of its Bureaus, Institutes or Divisions aredestroyed no later than 5 years after completion of the evaluation study(NIH Records Control Schedule, items 1100-C-12d, 1100-C-14b, 1100-C-15b).Policy Coordination for this system is provided by: Associate Directorfor Science, Policy and Legislation, National Institutes of Health, Building1, Room 137, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892.system managers and addresses:See Appendix 1.notification procedure:To determine if a record exists, write to the official of the organizationresponsible for the evaluation, as listed in Appendix 2.
