Traders said this prompted Canada's central bank to intervene in defense of its currency.    The sell-off of the Canadian currency, which began in Asian trading, coincided with a partial pullout from the Canadian government bond market by Japanese investors, traders said. Japanese investors had been attracted to Canadian bonds because of their relatively high yields.    In late New York trading yesterday, the Canadian dollar stood at 74.93 U.S. cents, down 0.7% from 75.46 U.S. cents Tuesday. Against the Japanese currency, the Canadian unit fell 0.9% to 106.54 yen from 107.48.    Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was narrowly mixed in light activity as traders awaited today's report on first-quarter U.S. economic growth. Traders said the dollar's recent exchange rates reflect expectations that the U.S. economy grew at an annual pace of between 3% and 3 1/2%.    A little more than a week ago, the Canadian dollar rebounded to nearly 77 U.S. cents, its highest point in about 2 1/2 years. Japanese investors were the main buyers, drawn by yields of 9 1/4% or more on long-term Canadian bonds. That compared with the 8% yield then available on long-term U.S. Treasurys and 3 1/2% on 10-year Japanese bonds.    Japanese investors &quot;have been diversifying out of U.S. dollars and into Canadian dollars lately,&quot; Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief currency trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd. in New York, said.    Those investors decided yesterday to take profits on the Canadian currency's rise and, to a lesser extent, capital gains on Canadian bonds, Mr. Miyamori said.    Mr. Miyamori said most of the proceeds from Japanese sales of Canadian-dollar assets are headed back to Japan, mainly to the booming Tokyo stock market, or to Europe.    &quot;So far, they aren't considering investing in the U.S., because of the foreign exchange risk and the falling prices of bonds,&quot; he said. In Japan, he said, &quot;everybody's expecting higher stock prices.&quot;    The Bank of Canada intervened in yesterday's trading to buy its currency against the U.S. dollar, but to little avail, dealers said.    The central bank was buying &quot;aggressively,&quot; John I. Shupe, a trader at Royal Bank of Canada in New York, said, &quot;but there appears to be too much (selling) on the other side.&quot;    Some traders speculated that the Japanese pullout from Canada is a short-term rather than a strategic move. Mr. Miyamori predicted that if the Canadian dollar falls much closer to 74 U.S. cents, Japanese investors &quot;will buy it back again.&quot;    In other foreign exchange activity, the Bank of England intervened in European trading, selling British pounds to counter the currency's rise. In late New York trading, the pound eased to $1.6283 from $1.6343. The pound was unchanged against the West German currency at 2.97 marks.    The U.S. currency was little changed against most other major currencies. It dipped fractionally to 142.18 yen from 142.43 and firmed to 1.8245 marks from 1.8180.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 142.10 yen.    The dollar was supported by cautious trading strategies ahead of today's Commerce Department report on first-quarter growth. The currency also was helped by rumors, many of them from Tokyo, that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board will soon tighten credit to bolster the dollar.    Long-term sentiment on the dollar remains predominantly bearish, traders said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.80 an ounce to $449.40 in brisk trading. Estimated volume was five million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $451.25 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Wednesday, April 22, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
