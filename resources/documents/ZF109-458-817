And now they call me a visionary.&quot;andM;More laughter, led by Gore.andM;At issue here is a bill introduced by Gore to formulate long-rangeinformation technology policy, including federal investment in a nationalcomputer network 50,000 times faster than the current network, linkingU.S.-funded supercomputer centers at academic institutions across the nation.andO;The proposed 1-gigabit network, endorsed by the Bush administration, isexpected to set standards through the 1990s for high-bandwidthcommunications, including information systems connected to offices and homes.andO;Several witnesses at the hearing compare the high-bandwidth computer networkto the interstate highway system built with federal funds-as necessary forinterstate commerce, as a way of keeping the Japanese at bay, as American asapple pie.andM;Only Nelson manages to sound a paean to private enterprise while suggestingthat the network proposal may not be sufficient: &quot;We're not looking for ahandout.... We believe that the capacities of the information providers ofthis nation are going to absorb your bandwidth in three months or so of whenit opens.andM;&quot;It's like the first Xerox machines.... I was in various committee meetingswhere they were trying to decide whether a university could use a whole Xeroxmachine.... And so, within a week, of course, the entire capability wassopped up.andP;  Similarly for open hypertext publishing....&quot;andM;After a plug for Xanadu, Nelson concludes, &quot;Now we look on you to give us thepathways, the superhighways for information to carry this stuff, but we thinkthe private sector may be able to do a lot more than you think for thedigital libraries of tomorrow.&quot;andM;With Gore vigorously agreeing and saluting private enterprise, this is one ofNelson's finest moments-in his own immodest estimation.andP;  Then again, he hastrouble remembering his other finest moments.andM;The Purple Prophet at Big BlueandM;Ted Nelson suffers from chronic forgetfulness (as did 19th-century Englishpoet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who, when awakened from an exotic dream ofXanadu, struggled to recreate it in his poem Kubla Khan).andP;  One reason thatNelson envisioned hypertext and Xanadu was to find a way to computerize andcross-reference the millions of cards and pages of notes he accumulates (onethought or idea per page) so he wouldn't forget.andP;  He stored piles of hisboxed, handwritten notes in warehouses in Poughkeepsie, New York, and in SanAntonio, Texas, where they accumulated storage charges for years before beingtransferred to a warehouse near his home in California's Marin County.andM;If Nelson had his notes on Xanadu right now, he might recall another scene,just four days before his Senate appearance, when he addressed a small butavid audience at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center.andP;  Much of hisreputation as a curmudgeon arose from his unrelenting criticism of IBM; henoted, for instance, in Computer Lib/ Dream Machines that &quot;IBM is, to my wayof thinking, the way the Soviet Union would be if the Soviet Union worked.&quot;andM;Nelson, still predicting IBM's demise while recognizing such positiveaccomplishments as the PC, is the last person you'd expect to see at IBM.andM;Yet here he is in an office building in Westchester County, north of New YorkCity, pacing before and addressing two dozen casually dressed IBM researchersin a small seminar room at one of Big Blue's most prestigious labs.andP;  Sportinghis sartorial trademark-purple shirt and purple socks-along with aconservative suit, his belt laden with pens and other paraphernalia, Nelsonbrings to mind a scholarly combination of Robin Hood and Cyrano de Bergerac,two of his childhood heroes.andP;  &quot;I always carry pens like swords in ascabbard,&quot; Nelson explains later.andP;  &quot;I'm like a swordsman with words, alwaysready for a fight.&quot;andM;Instead of a fight, Nelson is greeted with sympathetic smiles.andP;  &quot;This is notmy profession; this is my religion,&quot; he declares, launching into afreewheeling description of Xanadu.andP;  The room seems filled with willingconverts.andP;  &quot;I believe this represents the next stage in civilization, andit's absolutely imperative if there's to be any chance of human survival....&quot;andM;Nelson's theology is simple: We've been living in an informational Babel ofincompatible formats and protocols, with worldwide catastrophe looming.andP;  Tosave the planet, we must assure the availability of computerized documentsthat can be compiled, compared, footnoted and commented upon.andP;  With all thenecessary links and inclusions, this universal literary system will promotean orderly controversy of ideas, resolving misunderstandings and beckoning anew millennium.andM;Ultimately, all publishing of magazines, books, movies, music and the likewill be done with his open hypertext system &quot;in that great computer in thesky, the storage repository, be it mainframe or network, to which we will allhave access.&quot;andM;For many years, those of little faith have argued that computer storage istoo expensive to accommodate the massive memory needed to put every publisheddocument on earth online.andP;  The explosive growth of computer memory andresulting plunge in costs have brought Nelson's vision to the realm ofpossibility.andM;Still, his dogma's sticking point has been the problem that plagues allcurrent databases: the proportionally greater lag in access time when thesize and complexity of a data pool increase.andP;  But Xanadu, of course, is notjust another database; programming breakthroughs assure the system's goal ofunlimited growth, with storage and retrieval algorithms that keep increasedaccess time to a logarithmic curve-nearly flat for a large information base.andM;Inveighing Against SubstitutesandM;With the promised land in view, Nelson warns against the false prophets ofcurrent hypertext implementations.andP;  &quot;They just lead to balkanization andchaos,&quot; he says of systems like Apple's HyperCard program, bundled with everyMacintosh (&quot;What if you want to add comments?&quot;), and the much-touted charmsof CD-ROM (&quot;The good news is you can have 400MB on your desk; the bad news isyou can have only 400MB.andP;  What good are 400MB? I want everything.&quot;).andP;  OnlyXanadu, he says, has the potential to unify the complete realm of humanknowledge.andM;For the true believer, authentic hypertext capability will begin with theimminent release of the Xanadu Hypermedia Information Server.andP;  Still, afteryears of waiting for Xanadu to materialize (a prototype was completed in 1988but was put aside to add more features in the new design), how can even thefaithful be certain that the product isn't yet another mirage?andM;&quot;For the first time Xanadu has offices, salaries, PERT charts, professionalsoftware development managers.andP;  It's a whole new organization.andP;  They willdefinitely deliver the products they're talking about.&quot; So says Eric Drexler,author of the acclaimed Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology(Anchor Press, Doubleday, 1986) and a key contributor to Xanadu's softwarecoding.andP;  Drexler, chief programmer Mark Miller and keeper of the flame RogerGregory are among the talented band of scientists and programmers attractedto Nelson's dream over the last decade, often contributing their time andability during scarce leisure periods &quot;in an atmosphere somewhere betweenCamelot and the Manhattan Project,&quot; as Nelson likes to describe it.andM;Today's Xanadu Operating Company came into being in April 1988, when Autodeskpurchased an 80 percent interest in the firm (see &quot;One Company Stakes ItsFuture on Innovation,&quot; PC/Computing, September 1989, page 86).andP;  As a result,the current president of Xanadu, Ron McElhaney, is Autodesk's vice presidentof engineering.andP;  And though Nelson is the originator, prophet, guru,propagandist and conscience of Xanadu, his current status does not include anofficial role in the Xanadu Operating Company.andM;As a Distinguished Fellow at Autodesk, which is headquartered in Sausalito,California, Nelson does get the wherewithal and time to travel extensively,spreading the word as he's doing at IBM (a week before, he was in Finland).andO;According to Nelson, &quot;I make these speeches about the great world repository,and it makes it sound as though the Xanadu Operating Company's contribution,a piece of software that you will be able to buy, is just some footnote.andO;Whereas, in fact, it's what runs the whole thing.&quot;andM;In charge of software administration for Xanadu is Marc Stiegler, whocautions that the realities of bringing a product to market may cast adifferent light on some of Nelson's statements about upcoming programs.andO;Already the relation of the software to Nelson's gospel, as set out in hisself-published Literary Machines (Mindful Press, 1981; 3020 Bridgeway, #295,Sausalito, Calif.andP;  94965, $25), is a matter of dispute.andP;  As Stiegler puts it:&quot;Whatever Ted says that is true, we say that's true; whatever Ted says iswrong, we say that's Ted.&quot;andM;All parties agree that within months the Xanadu Hypermedia Information Serverwill offer the first document filing system software to support all forms ofdigital data (text, graphics, video and audio) with two-way hypertext linksfor branching to and from points of interest (also flexible &quot;span-links&quot;between groups of links) and the inclusion of documents within any otherdocument without having to copy the entire text into it (&quot;transclusion,&quot;which keeps all versions current).andM;In database vernacular, the server software is a &quot;back end,&quot; meant tomaintain the links between documents but too complex in its demands for theuser seeking to retrieve a document and related materials to access directly.andM;For that, third-party firms are expected to offer application programs, or&quot;front ends.&quot; The company will issue its own &quot;exemplar front end&quot; packagesfor IBM PC and Macintosh computers to provide generic capability to edit,save and retrieve hypermedia and &quot;do for Xanadu what MacPaint and MacDraw didfor the Macintosh,&quot; according to Stiegler.andP;  &quot;But there's no right way todesign a front end.andP;  We expect as many front-end programs as there arespecialized informational needs.&quot; Obvious candidates for Xanadu front endsare legal, academic and CAD/CAM file retrieval applications.andM;In order to keep the core software as universal as possible, the Xanadu teamis concentrating on back-end issues.andP;  A standard joke: &quot;How many Xanadupeople does it take to screw in a light bulb? None.andP;  That's a front-endproblem.&quot;andM;At the heart of Xanadu software is a new data structure invented by EricDrexler and implemented by the programming group.andP;  The structure allowsaccess to as little as a single byte of data or the entire Xaniverse ofavailable documents.andM;Thanks to this data structure, documents stored and referenced on one networkcan quickly be integrated into or accessed by any other computer systemrunning Xanadu.andP;  The identifier should not be confused with anotherXanaword-xandle.andP;  Like a handle on CB radio, a xandle is a unique identifyingname for each user.andP;  Special xandles are already being reserved for a $100fee by the company.andP;  Among the xandles reserved by Nelson are Generalistimoand Strategic Hamlet.andP;  For Nelson's plans to promote public access to Xanadu,see &quot;The MeDonald's of Information,&quot; page 203.)andM;Back to the futureandM;The Xanadu dream dates to the fall of 1960 and Nelson's term project for agraduate course at Harvard on computers in the social sciences.andP;  Theinspiration for Xanadu extends back another two decades, with an article byVannevar Bush titled &quot;How We May Thank&quot; in the July 1945 issue of TheAtlantic Monthly.andP;  Anticipating the information overload of today, Bushargued for the creation of a device he named a &quot;Memex,&quot; an electronic deskthat provides access to any text on any subject in seconds.andP;  Realizing thatsuch a system would require capabilities similar to paperbased literature andpublishing, including citation, historical backtrack and attribution forroyalty payments, Nelson devised a wish list for Xanadu.andP;  Then he set aboutto make it a reality, writing thousands of lines of code in the early '60s.andO;Since then, he has concentrated on design, leaving the actual coding toothers.andM;In 1964, Nelson came up with the term hypertext for the nonsequential writingwith free user movement made possible by Xanadu.andP;  Using the prefix hyper-from mathematics, where it means &quot;extended&quot; or, as in hyperspace, &quot;havingmore than three dimensions,&quot; be coined a word he was certain would catch onlike wildfire.andP;  When it did, more than 20 years later, it reminded people ofthe use of hyper- in psychology and medicine, where it denotes somethingextreme or pathological.andM;&quot;There is this awkward tension of terminology,&quot; Nelson admits.andP;  The tensionis hardly alleviated by such clumsy usage as the announcement forScholastic's new HyperScreen, &quot;The revolutionary program that bringshyperpower to everyone's classroom computer.&quot;andM;To many computer users, hypertext was an incomprehensible notion until 1987,when Apple Computer ace programmer Bill Atkinson created a popularnotecard-style software implementation of hypertext, the infamous HyperCard.andM;Bundled with every Macintosh sold since then, HyperCard's hot buttons havebecome available to over 1 million users, but its hypertext capabilities areas limited in comparison with Xanadu's as Microsoft BASIC (still bundled withvirtually every MS-DOS computer sold) is when compared with an efficient,structured programming language such as C. (For more on HyperCard and similarprograms for the PC, see &quot;Other Hypertext Products&quot; on page 209.)andM;During HyperCard's development, Apple gave Ted Nelson short shrift, invitinghim to its Cupertino, California, headquarters, picking his brain at variouslevels of the company, from President John Sculley on down.andP;  Nonetheless,Nelson remains sanguine: &quot;I don't feel I was exploited by Apple.andP;  Theirbringing out HyperCard gave me a lot of notoriety.&quot;andM;In fact, Nelson's notoriety within the computer industry began in 1974, whenhe published his oversize-format Computer Lib/Dream Machines, credited as thefirst personal computer book.andP;  A humanist's-eye view of computers and theculture surrounding them, Nelson's individualistic tome influenced many ofpersonal computing's soon-to-be successful entrepreneurs.andP;  As Bill Gates,chairman of Microsoft, once recalled for journalist Howard Rheingold, &quot;I cameacross Ted Nelson's book when I was in college, not long before I foundedMicrosoft.andP;  And Nelson's vision of what personal computers could become wascertainly inspiring to me.&quot;andM;In 1987, Gates's Microsoft Press published a revised edition of ComputerLib/Dream Machines.andP;  [Editor's Note: The author of this article was the agentfor Nelson's book contract with Microsoft Press but no longer has a financialinterest in any of Nelson's projects.] The new edition includes someself-congratulatory remarks by the author, printed in italics.andP;  For example:&quot;In going through this material again, I am amazed to see most of theimportant world issues of today clearly foreseen.andP;  Starvation-filled lands,pie-in-the-sky defensive systems, and freedom of information will remainissues, unfortunately, for the indefinite future.&quot;andM;For all of his prescience, some of Nelson's revisions to Computer Libacknowledge that he was wrong about certain things, like the TRAC languagehaving a big impact: &quot;It didn't.andP;  (I even tried to argue Bill Gates out ofBASIC, I think it may have been in '76.andP;  That's funny enough to admit.) Ialso thought the Apple II, with no lower case, had no future.&quot;andM;Once Xanadu is up and running on a large enough system, Nelson wants topursue his other interests, which include filmmaking.andP;  He may even takeadvantage of one of the rewards of his notoriety-a standing offer to use thehigh-tech editing facilities at Lucasfilm.andM;&quot;I still think of myself as a philosopher and filmmaker, primarily,&quot; remarksthis computer prophet.andP;  &quot;There's more to Ted Nelson than hypertext-and moreto hypertext than anyone has seen.&quot;andM;Steve Ditlea, a frequent contributor to PC/Computing, has been coveringpersonal computer technology for 10 years.andP;  He lives in Armonk, New York.andM;The McDonald's of informationandM;The Xanadu vision will remain incomplete until one important development, theimplementation of which Ted Nelson has reserved for himself as sole licenseeof Xanadu software for publishing with royalties.andP;  His name for thisapplication is Public Access Xanadu, a &quot;licensed and franchised storage andforwarding service run along the lines of McDonald's.&quot; Though the date mayslip, Nelson predicts that Public Access Xanadu, or PAX, will begin operationin August 1991.andM;PAX will not deal with the public directly but will license franchises to&quot;storage vendors,&quot; who will actually provide the licensed services andmaintain the necessary support equipment.andM;Nelson envisions PAX-franchised Silverstands, information stands that are theequivalent of McDonald's, where billions of documents are served.andP;  instead ofthe golden arches, Silverstands will be marked by the sign of the Flaming X,a PAX trademark-the torch of freedom burning forever.andM;Inside will be cheerful personnel in Star Trek-like uniforms signing up andassisting new PAX users, who con then access or publish documents at aworkstation in the stand or telecommunicate with Xanadu from home or office.andO;A monthly bill from a Silverstand would consist of charges for connect time,storage, transmisson time, publication fees, publication registration feesand delivery, minus any credits for royalties from others reading the user'spublished words and/or images and sound.andM;As McDonald's does, Nelson expects to recruit, with at least $400,000 incash, hard-working, well-financed franchisees willing to be trained inoperations at Xanadu Central, patterned along the lines of HamburgerUniversity.andP;  To give franchisees &quot;the feeling of belonging to something morethan a brokerage firm,&quot; PAX will have a traveling core of generalists andscholars who will set the corporate culture and tone for the stands.andM;Nelson says of PAX: &quot;This is an ideology.andP;  This is something to believe in.&quot;andM;Other Hypertext ProductsandM;In the jargon of industry press releases and product announcements, the termhypertext, unmoored from the initial vision of its creator, describes a widevariety of products.andP;  And according to Danny Goodman, a HyperCard developerand the author of The Complete HyperCard Handbook, users are confused.andP;  &quot;Thename [HyperCard) is unfortunate,&quot; says Goodman.andP;  &quot;In ideal hypertext,anything-any bit of art, text or music-can become a `button.' In HyperCard,that's just not possible.andP;  You can't really create buttons on the fly.&quot;andM;Hypertext has, however, inspired a number of useful products for the PC.andO;Although none of these delivers the power and flexibility of Nelson's idealsystem, all of them can help you organize information into cards and stacksand establish links between related entries.andM;LinkWay 2.0andM;Targeted for educational markets,andM;LinkWay organizes information into pages and foldersandM;and includes support forandM;videodiscs and other multimediaandM;peripherals.andM;LIST PRICE.andP;  $98, single; $686,andM;network.andM;REQUIRES:andM;512K RAM, DOS 2.1 or later.andM;IBM Educational SystemsandM;P.O.andP;  Box 2150andM;Atlanta, Ga.andP;  30055andM;(800) 627-0920andM;Folio Views 2.0andM;An information managementandM;system that lets you compressandM;large text files into a customizedandM;&quot;infobase&quot; and createandM;cross-referencing links.andM;LIST PRICE: $495andM;REQUIRES:andM;512K RAM, DOS 2.0.andM;Folio Corp.andM;2155 N.
