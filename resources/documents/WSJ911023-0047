Grain prices are also climbing on speculation that theWhite House is contemplating a bigger-than-expected food aidpackage to the Soviet Union.</LP><TEXT>   The Agriculture Department's quarterly 13-state survey offeedlots, which fatten livestock for meatpackers, showed that15% fewer young cattle were placed onto feedlots during July,August and September compared with the year-ago period.   September placements were the lowest for that month since1981. Most of the cattle put onto feedlots last month will beheavy enough for slaughter this winter.   The report, which was in line with analysts' expectations,was released after the close of trading yesterday at theChicago Mercantile Exchange. The cattle contract for Decemberdelivery slipped 0.22 cent a pound to settle at 76.42 cents apound.   Some analysts said the quarterly survey shows that U.S.ranchers reacted to an unexpectedly sharp drop in cattleprices this summer by keeping a tight lid on their herds. Asa result, cattle prices could hold between 75 cents a poundand 77 cents a pound during the 1992 first quarter, said JohnNalivka, executive vice president of Sterling Marketing Inc.,Lenexa, Kan.   The Agriculture Department also reported that feedlots inits 13-state thirdquarter survey sold 4% more cattle tomeatpackers than in the 1990 quarter. Cattle on feedlots onOct. 1 was 6% lower than a year earlier.   A sudden burst of grain export news pushed up prices ofwheat, corn and soybean futures contracts. As expected, theSoviet Union began bidding for 1.1 million metric tons ofsubsidized U.S. wheat. Egypt and Morocco, among others, alsoplaced combined orders for about 400,000 metric tons of U.S.wheat.   The price of some wheat futures contracts touchedlife-of-contract highs during the trading session. At theChicago Board of Trade, the wheat contract for Decemberdelivery hit $3.63 a bushel before settling at $3.6075   Moscow responded swiftly to the Agriculture Department'soffer on Friday to subsidize the sale of three million metrictons of U.S. wheat to the Soviet Union. Under a programdesigned to boost U.S. exports, the department compensatesexporters that ship discount-priced U.S. farm commodities tocertain nations such as China and the Soviet Union.   U.S. grain analysts had been speculating that thefinancially strapped Soviet Union would be able to arrangeenough Western bank loans to immediately buy slightly morethan one million metric tons of the subsidized wheat. To getthe loans, Moscow probably used the last of the export creditguarantees it had from the U.S.   How quickly the Soviets buy the rest of thediscount-priced wheat hinges on when it receives additionalexport credit guarantees from the White House. Many graintraders have been speculating for several weeks that the Bushadministration will soon offer to guarantee payment on up to$2.5 billion in short-term loans that the Soviets can arrangeto buy U.S. food through September 1992. Traders arrived atthe figure because the administration has already awardedabout half of the $5 billion export credit guarantee programto other nations for fiscal 1992.   U.S. crop prices rose in part because of signs that theadministration is mulling whether to change the math.Administration officials indicated yesterday that PresidentBush might make an announcement on export credit guaranteesin time for his meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev in Spain next week, and that the administrationdidn't feel limited by the $5 billion spending cap.   Soviet officials have requested at least $3.5 billion inexport credit guarantees from the White House, and it iswidely rumored that Moscow has calculated that it could useup to $5 billion in guarantees to arrange food-buying loans.   According to Warren King, senior analyst at CargillInvestor Services Inc., Chicago, many U.S. grain traders arespeculating that additional export credit guarantees wouldallow the Soviets to buy between 10 million metric tons and12 million metric tons of U.S. corn by next fall.   Moscow bought about 8.5 million metric tons of U.S. cornduring the marketing year ended Sept. 30, analysts said.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          ENERGY: Petroleum prices fell in what market participantsgenerally called a correction after the runup of recentweeks. The biggest decline was in the futures price of crudeoil for November delivery. It dropped 56 cents to settle at$23.48 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Butyesterday's trading marked the expiration of the Novembercrude contract, adding to the volatility. December crudedeclined 28 cents to settle at $23.65 a barrel. Heating oiland gasoline futures also were lower. But few oil analystsexpect yesterday's downturn to gain momentum today. Althoughoil inventories are ample, the American Petroleum Institutereported after futures trading had ended yesterday that U.S.stocks of crude oil, heating oil and gasoline declined lastweek. The biggest drop was in distillates, which includeheating oil. Distillate inventories decreased by 1.9 millionbarrels to 135.4 million barrels last week.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices rose. Sugar for March delivery rose0.28 cent a pound to 8.95 cents. Sandra Kaul, an analyst atShearson Lehman Brothers, attributed the rise to buying by alarge commodity fund in a relatively thin market. She wasskeptical of vague rumors that physical buying was pushing upprices, noting there were no details or confirmation. Infact, said William O'Neill, senior futures strategist atMerrill Lynch, there has been very little trading in physicalsugar lately. He tied the rise in sugar prices yesterday tothe possibility of the Soviets receiving more creditguarantees than expected to buy grains, which in turn couldfree up more funds to buy sugar. In a recent report, E.D. andamp;F. Man Sugar said anticipation of credit arrangements thatwould facilitate Soviet sugar purchases has been the onlyfactor keeping sugar prices from falling. But looking ahead,the report said, an expected increase in raw sugar suppliesthis year and the possibility of more Cuban sugar flowinginto the world market should depress prices.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Platinum prices fell. Platinum forOctober delivery ended at $369.40 an ounce, down $3.80; theactively traded January contract also fell $3.80 to $371.40.Japanese selling in Tokyo for currency-related reasons causedplatinum prices to weaken, analysts said. But John Brimelow,who follows platinum and gold at BV Capital Markets, abrokerage firm in New York, said platinum prices shouldstrengthen in the weeks ahead. Worsening labor and politicalproblems at a major South African mine and reduced shipmentsfrom the Soviet Union could create &quot;an exciting time&quot; inplatinum over the next six to eight weeks, with pricespossibly rising to $400, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
