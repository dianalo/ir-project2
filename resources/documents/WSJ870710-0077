Later, the Senate also voted to allow the president to prevent the imposition of import restraints designed to protect a battered domestic industry, if he finds that such controls would &quot;disproportionately burden the poor.&quot; That addition to the trade bill would soften the tough stance taken by the Senate earlier this week to limit the president's leeway in deciding on import relief.    In a big victory for labor, lawmakers rejected, 60-40, an attempt to remove the controversial provision from the trade package. Under the provision, which thus survived, companies that close plants to consolidate work forces or to relocate to another region would be required to notify workers 60 days in advance.    Business groups immediately attacked the provision, and said they won't support the trade bill if Congress keeps the notification measure. &quot;We would oppose the trade bill now, that's for sure,&quot; said Renee Reymond, a lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers. &quot;But the fight isn't over. We will do everything we can to delete it in conference and then support a veto if it remains.&quot;    The House didn't approve a similar measure in its version of the bill, so a House-Senate conference committee would have to decide whether to leave the provision in the bill that ultimately is to be sent to the president.    &quot;I don't have much doubt that the House will accept this provision,&quot; said Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio), sponsor of the notification measure. &quot;The basic issue of right-to-notice has been enunciated loudly and clearly . . . and we won by a larger margin that we had anticipated.&quot;    But Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.), who led the opposition to the provision, noted that its adoption undercut business backing for the trade bill and predicted that President Reagan will veto the measure. He said the goal of the union-backed measure was &quot;to stop plants from being closed.&quot;    Seeking to ease business concerns, Democrats on Wednesday agreed to exempt from the mandatory-notice requirement &quot;faltering&quot; companies that are seeking new capital or business in an attempt to avert a shutdown, &quot;and who reasonably believe that giving notice will preclude them from maintaining operations.&quot;    The bill also would require prior notice of layoffs that are for more than six months or of indefinite duration, if they involve at least one-third of a given work force. Plant closings affecting fewer than 100 people, or layoffs affecting fewer than 50 people, wouldn't be covered. Seasonal and part-time employees also wouldn't be covered.    Sen. Metzenbaum said advance notice would save millions of dollars a year in unemployment benefits because workers targeted for layoffs could begin seeking and training for new jobs earlier.    Under the provision, an employer who doesn't provide advance notice will be liable to each aggrieved employee for back pay and the cost of certain fringe benefits. Employers also would be liable to local governments for civil penalties.    The Senate action came as U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter again warned that President Reagan would veto the Senate bill in its present form.    &quot;There's no chance whatsoever of the president signing the trade bill as it presently exists in the Senate version,&quot; Mr. Yeutter told reporters.    He asserted that members of Congress are losing their &quot;sense of direction,&quot; and pressing for protectionist laws that could make the nation a &quot;minor-league&quot; player in world trade. However, he said the administration would continue to work for trade legislation it would find acceptable.    One of the Reagan administration's biggest objections to the trade bill involves a provision sharply limiting the president's discretion in deciding whether to grant import relief -- typically import quotas or tariffs -- to domestic industries. On Tuesday, the Senate had voted to require the president to order such protection, except in narrow circumstances, if recommended by the International Trade Commission. But the amendment approved yesterday, which would allow the president to reject import relief if it would hurt the poor, would restore much of the president's discretion.    &quot;I'm delighted with this,&quot; said Sen. Bob Packwood (R., Ore.), who led the fight Tuesday to weaken the import-relief provision. He said the amendment would enable the president to deny relief in &quot;99% of the cases&quot; involving import relief.    Under the amendment, the president would be able to reject tariffs or quotas if they would increase the price of consumer goods purchased by poor people. &quot;All import relief disproportionately burdens the poor,&quot; Sen. Packwood said, because most imports are cheap products purchased by the poor.    Sen. Bill Bradley (D., N.J.), sponsor of the amendment, acknowledged that it was designed to &quot;restore some discretion to the president&quot; in deciding import-relief cases.    The Senate then approved another amendment that would allow the president to reject import relief to domestic industry when such relief would &quot;disproportionately burden&quot; American agriculture with respect to exports, jobs and income.    Meanwhile, the Senate yesterday also voted 61-38 to reject an amendment to the trade bill that would have barred all trade between the U.S. and Angola. Rebels supported by the U.S. are fighting that country's Marxist government. Angola supplies about 4% of the America's imported oil.    As the Senate continued to debate the trade bill, some Republicans and Democrats were working to craft a compromise on another controversial pending amendment, which would force foreign countries to reduce their huge trade surpluses with the U.S. or face retaliation.    One alternative under discussion would direct the president to identify specific countries with &quot;consistent patterns&quot; of trade barriers and to negotiate or retaliate an end to those barriers. But unlike a similar amendment that was sponsored by Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.) and adopted by the House, the possible Senate compromise version wouldn't specify what retaliatory steps the president would have to take. Nor would it specify how much the trade surplus with countries such as Japan would have to be reduced. </TEXT></DOC>
