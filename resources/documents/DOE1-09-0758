The author's are using antennaeof NASA's Deep Space Network/sup c/ to detect the /sup 3/He/sup +/F =0-1 hyperfine emission line at {lambda}= 3.46 cm from Galactic H II regions.Their observations of W3 give a /sup 3/He/H number ratio of 1 x 10/sup-4/, which is significantly smaller than the ratio measured by otherinvestigators. They confirm that W3, despite its large galactocentricdistance, has been enriched in /sup 3/He. They failed to detect /sup3/He/sup +/ in the planetary nebula NGC 6853 to a limit of /sup 3/He/Handless; 2 x 10/sup -4/. This number ratio suggests that PNs are not a majorsource of Galactic /sup 3/He. Present /sup 3/He measurements place onlyweak constraints on models of early-universe nucleosynthesis.</TEXT></DOC>
