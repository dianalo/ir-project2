Vice Foreign Minister Liu Huaqiu lodged a strongly wordedprotest with U.S. Ambassador James Lilley over the bill, whichCongress has sent to President Bush for signing, a U.S. diplomatsaid.   Liu, who is responsible for North American affairs, told Lilleythat China regards the bill as interference in its internal affairs``and hopes the U.S. government will take action to stop it,'' saidthe diplomat, who declined to be further identified.   The bill was drafted to protest the Chinese army's violentattack on the unarmed protesters June 3-4. It crushed a movementthat had demanded democratic, educational and other social reforms.   The Chinese government called the demonstrations``counterrevolutionary turmoil'' instigated with help fromoverseas. It said they sought to overthrow China's Communist regime.   ``Since the Chinese government put down the counterrevolutionaryrebellion ... in accordance with the Chinese constitution and laws,the U.S. Congress has meddled in China's internal affairs andstirred up an anti-China wave by adopting one resolution afteranother on this matter which is purely the internal affairs ofChina,'' Liu was quoted as saying by state-run television and theXinhua News Agency.   ``The U.S. Congress still goes ahead with the adoption of aresolution against China, basing itself on false reports andrumors, and thus gravely damaging the Sino-U.S. relations andhurting the national feelings of the Chinese people,'' Liu wasquoted as saying.   The bill, which Bush could veto, imposes two years of tradesanctions including suspension of trade assistance, halts riskinsurance for American firms doing business in China, and freezesexports of satellites, controlled munitions such as helicopters andcertain nuclear material and components.   The bill condemns what it calls the ``unprovoked, brutal andindiscriminate assault'' on the protesters and unarmed civilians,which it said left 700 dead.   China has said some 300 people died, but western intelligenceestimates put the number as high as 3,000.   In Dhaka, Bangladesh, Chinese Premier Li Peng said Sunday thatWestern trade sanctions against China because of its crackdown ondissent would backfire and hurt the countries imposing therestrictions.   ``These sanctions are causing considerable strains on thedevelopment process,'' Li said. ``Western investment is not onlybeneficial to China but also to those who have invested.''</TEXT></DOC>
