The funds are being held in aninterest-bearing escrow account pending distribution by the DOE.The OHA has decided to distributed these funds in accordance with the DOE'sModified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude Oil Overcharges,51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986). Under the Modified Policy, crude oil overchargemonies are divided among the states, the federal government, and injuredpurchasers of refined products. Refunds to the states will be distributedin proportion to each state's consumption of petroleum products duringthe period of price controls. Refunds to eligible purchasers will be basedon the number of gallons of petroleum products which they purchased andthe extent to which they can demonstrate injury.Applications for refund must be filed by June 30, 1988, and should be sentto the address set forth at the beginning of this notice.

These procedures are used to refund monies to those injuredby actual or alleged violations of the DOE price regulations.  The ERA has filed 111 Petitions for the Implementation of Special RefundProcedures for crude oil overcharge funds obtained from the 111 firms whosenames and OHA case numbers appear in Appendix B to this Decision.\1\<NOTE/> To date, these 111 firms have remitted a total of $130.5million to the DOE pursuant to court-approved settlements, DOE consentorders or remedial order.\2\<NOTE/> An addtional $71.3 million in interest has accrued on thatamount as of December 31, 1987. This Decision and Order establishes proceduresfor distributing those funds.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Of those 111 Petitions, 94 were the subject of Final Decisionsand Orders that were issued by the OHA prior to the implementation of theDOE's Modified Statement of Restitutionary Policy Concerning Crude OilOvercharges, 51 FR 27899 (August 4, 1986) (hereinafter referred to as the``MSRP''). The MSRP represents a major change in the Department's handlingof crude oil overcharge cases. Accordingly, as discussed below, we areestablishing revised procedures, pursuant to the MSRP, to distribute thecrude oil violation amounts involved in those cases. In addition, we areincluding in this determination four ERA Petitions for which procedureswere proposed but never finalized. Finally, we are also including 13 ERAPetitions on which no action had been taken prior to the Allerkamp PDandamp;O.52 FR 39987 (October 26, 1987).  <ITAG tagnum="28">In 17 of the cases consolidated in this Decision, as noted in AppendixB, the alleged regulatory violations involved the sale of both crude oiland refined petroleum products. The moneys remitted were divided into twopools_one for crude oil and one for refined products. Here we are institutingprocedures to distribute only the crude oil pools established in thosecases. The procedures previously proposed or developed to distribute therefined product pools are unaffected by this Decision.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\As noted in Appendix B, eight firms have outstanding liabilitiesto the DOE. These funds, as they are remitted to the Department, will alsobe disbursed pursuant to the procedures established in this Decision. TheDOE will give notice when such additional funds are received.  The general guidelines which the OHA may use to formulate and implementa plan to distribute refunds are set forth in 10 CFR Part 205, SubpartV. The Subpart V process may be used in situations where the DOE cannotreadily identify the person who may have been injured as a result of actualor alleged violations of the regulations or ascertain the amount of therefund each person should receive. For a more detailed discussion of SubpartV and the authority of the OHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds,see <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE andpara;82,508 (1981), and <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara;82,597 (1981). We have consideredthe ERA's requests to implement Subpart V procedures with respect to themonies received from the 111 firms listed in Appendix B and have determinedthat such procedures are appropriate. I. BackgroundA majority of the refund matters which are consolidated in the presentDecision and Order were included in three previous decisons issued by theOHA in 1982 and 1984. <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE <T2>andpara;</T2>82,521 (1982) (<T3>Alkek</T3>); <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>9 DOE <T2>andpara;</T2>82,553 (1982) (<T3>Adams</T3>); and <T3>A. Johnson andamp; Co., Inc., </T3> 12 DOE <T2>andpara;</T2>85,102 (1984) (<T3>A. Johnson</T3>). A number of other cases were intitiated as the resultof ``global'' consent orders resolving alleged overcharges by firms intheir sales of both crude oil and refined petroleum products. <T3>See, e.g., Standard Oil Co., </T3>(<T3>Indiana</T3>), 10 DOE <T2>andpara;</T2>85,048 (1982). In those early Subpart V decisions, the DOEpermitted injured persons to file claims and proposed to divide any unclaimedcrude oil overcharge funds among the states for indirect restitution, basedon their proportionate consumption of refined petroleum products. We recognizedin those decisions that the effects of crude oil pricing violations weregenerally spread by the Entitlements Program among all domestic refiners.<T3>See, e.g., Alkek, </T3> 9 DOE at 85,133. A major question remained,however, concerning the extent to which refiners absorbed or passed throughto their customers the increased costs associated with these violations.As a result of this uncertainty, claims from end-users were never consideredin those proceedings, and the more than 60 claims that were filed, mostlyby refiners, were held in abeyance. Due to the Final Settlement Agreementin <T3>The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation, </T3>M.D.L.No. 378 (D. Kan.), which led to the MSRP, we are now in a position to considercrude oil refund claims on their merits.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For a dicussion of the developments that culminated inthe Settlement Agreement, <T3>see</T3> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986);<T3>see also</T3> Notice Discussing Comments, 52 FR 11737 (April 10, 1987).The OHA has been applying the MSRP in all Subpart V proceedings involvingalleged crude oil violations. <T3>See</T3> Order Implementing the MSRP, 51 FR 29689 (August 20, 1986).That Order provided a period of 30 days for the filing of any objectionsto the application of the MSRP, and solicited comments concerning the appropriateprocedures to follow in processing refund applications in crude oil refundproceedings.On April 10, 1987, the OHA issued a Notice analyzing the numerous commentswhich it received in response to the August 1986 Order. 52 FR 11737. TheNotice set forth generalized procedures and provided guidance to assistclaimants that wish to file refund applications for crude oil money underthe Subpart V regulations. All applicants for refund would be requiredto document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the periodof price controls and to prove that they were injured by the alleged overcharges.The Notice indicated that end-users of petroleum products whose businessesare unrelated to the petroleum industry will be presumed to have absorbedthe crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any further proof of injuryto receive a refund. Finally, we stated that refunds would be calculatedon the basis of a per gallon refund amount derived by dividing crude oilviolation amounts by the total consumption of petroleum products in theUnited States during the period of price controls. The numerator wouldinclude the crude oil overcharge moneys that were in the DOE's escrow accountat the time of the settlement and a portion of the funds in the MDL 378escrow at the time of the settlement.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ On April 15, 1987, we issued a Decision establishing refundprocedures for 42 cases involving $373 million in crude oil violation amounts.A<T3>. Tarricone, Inc.,</T3> 15 DOE <T2>andpara;</T2>85,495 (1987). Those procedures conformed to the generalizedprocedures discussed in the April 10, 1987 Notice.These procedures have been approved by the United States District Courtfor the District of Kansas. Various States had filed a Motion with thatCourt, claiming that the OHA violated the Settlement Agreement by employingpresumptions of injury for end-users and by improperly calculating therefund amount to be used in those proceedings. On August 17, 1987, JudgeTheis issued an Opinion and Order denying the States' Motion in its entirety.The court concluded that the Settlement Agreement ``does not bar OHA frompermitting claimants to employ reasonable presumptions in affirmativelydemonstrating injury entitling them to a refund.'' <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>M.D.L. No. 378, 3 Fed. Energy Guidelines <T2>andpara;</T2>26,587 at 26,826 (D. Kan. 1987). The court also ruled that,as specified in the April 1987 Notice, the OHA could calculate refundsbased on a portion of the MDL 378 overcharges. <T3>Id. </T3>at 26,827. The States have appealed the latter ruling. <T3>In Re: The Department of Energy Stripper Well Exemption Litigation,</T3>No. 10-76 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. filed Nov. 5, 1987).II. The Proposed Decisions and OrdersOn October 19, 1987, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDandamp;O)establishing tentative procedures to distribute the alleged crude oil violationamounts involved in 109 cases. <T3>Ernest A. Allerkamp, </T3>52 FR 39987 (October 26, 1987). Proposedrefund procedures for two cases involving split pool accounts had alreadybeen set forth in separate PDandamp;Os issued earlier: <T3>Exxon Corp.,</T3> 52 FR 35313 (September 18, 1987); and <T3>Total Petroluem Inc.,</T3> 52 FR 18443 (May 15, 1987). The procedurestentatively established to distribute the crude oil pools in those twocases were similar to the proposed procedures in <T3>Allerkamp.</T3> Since the issues are the same, we are combining allthree proposed determinations into the present final Decision and Order.The OHA tentatively concluded in the three PDandamp;Os that the monies inthose cases should be distributed in accordance with the MSRP and the April10, 1987 Notice. Pursuant to the MSRP, the OHA proposed to reserve initially20 percent of the alleged crude oil violation amounts for direct restitutionto applicants who claim that they were injured by the alleged crude oilviolations. The remaining 80 percent of the funds would be distributedto the state and federal governments for indirect restitution. After allvalid claims are paid, any remaining funds in the claims reserve also wouldbe divided between the state and federal governments. The federal government'sshare ultimately would be deposited into the general fund of the Treasuryof the United States.In the three PDandamp;Os, the OHA proposed to require applicants for refundto document their purchase volumes of petroleum products during the periodof price controls and to prove that they were injured by the alleged crudeoil overcharges. The PDandamp;Os stated that end-users of petroleum productswhose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industry could use a presumptionthat they absorbed the crude oil overcharges, and need not submit any furtherproof of injury to receive a refund. The OHA also proposed to calculaterefunds on the basis of a per gallon refund amount derived by dividingcrude oil violation amounts (``the numerator'') by the total consumptionof petroleum products in the United States during the period of price controls(``the denominator''). In <T3>Allerkamp,</T3> the OHA proposed, on the basis of the conclusions reachedin the April 10, 1987 Notice to add $985 million to the numerator in additionto the $119 million in principal from the cases included in that PDandamp;O.Finally, the OHA also proposed in <T3>Allerkamp</T3> to combine all of the volumetric refund amounts obtainedin each crude oil refund proceeding implemented to date under the MSRP.Comments were solicited regarding the tentative distribution process setforth in the PDandamp;Os.III. Discussion of the Comments ReceivedIn response to the three PDandamp;Os, the OHA received comments from thefollowing: a group of 30 States and Territories of the United States; agroup of 43 ocean carriers and foreign air carriers; and Philip P. Kalodneras counsel for six electric utilities, 14 shipping companies and five pulpand paper manufacturers. Both the ocean and air carriers and Mr. Kalodner'sclients are potential recipients of crude oil refunds. They will be referredto collectively as the ``claimant commenters.'' In general, the commentersaddressed two issues: the presumption of injury for end-users and the calculationof refund amounts in crude oil cases.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. The Presumption of Injury for End-Users</ITAG>Two commenters expressed opinions concerning the nature and effect of ourpresumption of injury for end-users. Mr. Kalodner claims that, based onDOE policy and practice, this presumption ``must necessarily be irrebuttable.''Kalodner comments at 5. This claim is erroneous. The DOE has never statedthat the end-user presumption is irrebuttable. In fact, we have indicatedthat any interested party will have the opportunity to prove that a particularend-user applicant suffered no compensable injury. <T3>Berry Holding Co.,</T3> 16 DOE andpara; 85,495 at 88,797 (1987).At the opposite end of the spectrum, the States claim in their commentsthat the presumption of injury can be rebutted merely by the presentationof any evidence which bears upon the presumption. This contention is alsoerroneous. The claimants' burden of proof is eased by the presumption.If an interested party submits evidence to rebut the presumption of injury,we must first determine whether the evidence submitted is relevant to theissue. If the evidenced is relevant and sufficient to rebut the presumption,the claimant has the burden of coming forward with further evidence ofinjury. However, if we find the evidence submitted to rebut the presumptionto be insufficient, a refund to the end-user can be approved, based uponthe weight of the presumption, without requiring the end-user to submitfurther evidence of injury.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Calculation of Refunds</ITAG>The States continue to claim that it is erroneous to add $985 million tothe numerator of the volumetric formula. They also argue that paymentsto end-users should be further reduced to reflect an estimation of theamount of crude oil overcharges that were absorbed by refiners, resellersand retailers. In contrast, the claimant commenters fully support the additionof $985 million to the numerator. In fact, they contend that various additionalamounts should be included in the numerator. We will address each party'scontentions in turn.The States maintain that the addition of $985 million to the numeratorof the volumetric formula violates the terms of the Settlement Agreement.According to the States, the DOE has no authority to employ in its calculationof the volumetric any of the MDL 378 funds already distributed pursuantto the settlement. This argument has been rejected. According to the UnitedStates District Court for the District of Kansas, ``[n]either the SettlementAgreement nor the Subpart V regulations specifies a particular formulaDOE must employ in granting refunds. * * * DOE has not violated any provisionof the Settlement Agreement by factoring in a portion of other M.D.L. 378overcharges in compensating Subpart V claimants.'' 3 Fed. Energy Guidelinesandpara; 26,587 at 26,826-27. As we explained in the April 10, 1987 Notice,the inclusion of $985 million in the numerator ``compensates refund recipientsin MDL 378 and in Subpart V proceedings on an equal footing and most fairlyand equitably effectuates restitution for the injury they suffered as aresult of crude oil overcharges.'' 52 F. R. at 11741. We have consideredand rejected the States' contention to the contrary in the past, and ourposition has been approved by the District Court in Kansas.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In their comments, the States suggest that we ``refrainfrom distributing any of the 20% of overcharge funds reserved for SubpartV crude oil refunds'' until their appeal of the District Court's decisionin this matter is completed. States' comments at 9. We are certainly notrequired to delay granting refunds to qualified claimants while the States,who already have obtained sizeable payments of crude oil violation amountsunder Subpart V, carry on a potentially lengthy appellate process.The States also contend that any refunds to end-users should be reducedby the percentage of alleged crude oil overcharges that were absorbed byrefiners, resellers and retailers. In order to calculate this reduction,the States claim that the OHA should use the econometric evidence developedduring the evidentiary hearing conducted by the OHA during the StripperWell Exemption Litigation. That hearing, which lasted 22 days and produceda record of nearly 13,000 pages of written and oral testimony, resultedin a determination that domestic refiners as a class absorbed between 2.7and 8.1 percent of the crude oil overcharges. The remainder of the overchargeswere passed on to the national petroleum distribution network and to consumersof petroleum products. <T3>See </T3>52 FR at 11738. The States maintain that the amount of crudeoil overcharges absorbed by resellers and retailers could similarly becalculated by the use of econometric evidence and further evidentiary hearings.An end-user's refund, according to the States' plan, could then be reducedby the percentage of crude oil overcharges that were absorbed by thoseintermediaries in the crude oil distribution chain.This plan would unnecessarily delay the Subpart V refund process for anextended period of time and needlessly complicate the calculation of refunds.We adopted the ``full parity'' approach precisely because of its virtues,including the elimination of any ``need to consider nettlesome questionsof `upstream' overcharge absorption by middlemen in the oil distributionchain.'' 52 FR at 11741. Under the full parity approach, only $985 millionof the $1.4 billion in the MDL 378 escrow at the time of the SettlementAgreement is to be added to the numerator. The $415 million refunded torefiners, resellers and retailers is not included, and represents the totalamount of upstream absorption for all crude oil overcharges. Thus, thenumerator excludes the amount of injury attributed to those intermediariesin the distribution chain. We will adopt this approach as being the mostbalanced and fairest to all concerned.The claimant commenters endorse and approve of the use of the full parityapproach to calculating crude oil refunds. However, these commenters suggestthat various amounts should be added to the numerator of the volumetricformula in order to increase the size of refunds. The funds which the claimantcommenters would add to the numerator would come from four sources.First, the ocean and air carriers contend that all interest which has accruedon the crude oil violation amounts should be included in the numeratorof the volumetric formula. According to the carriers, including accruedinterest in the numerator is necessary ``if claimants are to be made whole''and are to be compensated ``for the lost time value of their money.'' Oceanand air carriers' comments at 3. In fact, there is no material differencebetween the OHA's proposed course of action and the position advocatedby these commenters. An appropriate amount of interest will be paid toall successful refund applicants. It is simply irrelevant whether the interestis added to the numerator or is calculated in some other manner.Second, the claimant commenters suggest that we should include in the numeratorthe $100 million in crude oil overcharge funds distributed to the statesand territories by the DOE in February 1983 pursuant to Section 155 ofthe Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 1982, Pub. L. No. 99-377 (theWarner Amendment). This suggestion goes too far. Both the Settlement Agreementand the MSRP by their terms apply only to the funds in escrow with thecourt or the DOE at the time of the court's approval of the settlementand to amounts received in the future. Thus the numerator to the volumetricformula also should include only those funds. Since the Warner Amendmentfunds were distributed prior to that time, the Settlement Agreement andthe MSRP clearly could not apply to them. They were therefore correctlyexcluded from the numerator of the volumetric formula.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ A list of the cases that were the source of the WarnerAmendment disbursement was published at 51 FR 26745 (July 25, 1986). ThatNotice explains the accounting adjustments made to account for the actualdisbursement of funds, which occurred much earlier. In two of those cases,the firms made additional payments to the DOE after the Settlement Agreementand the MSRP. This Decision applies to those payments. <T3>See </T3>Appendix B, notes 1 and 10.The same rationale holds true for the third suggested source of funds tobe added to the numerator. Mr. Kalodner contends that the numerator shouldinclude other crude oil violation amounts previously recovered by the UnitedStates, even if those funds had been distributed to the federal governmentprior to the Settlement Agreement. Mr. Kalodner would include in the numerator:(1) An estimated $100 million of funds that have been paid directly intothe United States Treasury prior to the Settlement Agreement by variousfirms in settlement of alleged crude oil violations; (2) ``additional amounts[that] have been paid to the benefit of the U.S. Treasury through contributionsto the Strategic Petroleum Reserve;'' and (3) $100 million ``constructivelyreceived'' by the United States government in settlement of claims regardingthe violation of crude oil regulations in the matter of <T3>Marc Rich andamp; Co., </T3>No. 83-579 (S.D.N.Y. 1984). Kalodner commentsat 13-16. Indirect restitution to citizens through payments to the UnitedStates Treasury was a remedy for crude oil overcharges that was entirelywithin the DOE's broad remedial discretion and it has been upheld by thecourts. <T3>See, e.g., Pennzoil, Co. </T3>v. <T3>DOE, </T3>Fed. Energy Guidelines (Court Decision 1981-1984) andpara;26,415(D. Del.), <T3>Aff'd on other gounds sub. nom., Cities Service Co. </T3><T3>v. </T3>DOE, 715 F.2d 572 (Temp. Emer. Ct. App. 1983). <T3>See also </T3>Ruling 1984-1, 49 FR 22063 (May 25, 1984). Subsequently,the DOE promulgated the MSRP, which specified the process to be used forrestitution of alleged crude oil violation amounts. As previously stated,both the MSRP and the Settlement Agreement apply prospectively only. Allof the funds outlined above were distributed prior to the court's approvalof the Settlement Agreement and the promulgation of the MSRP, and theyshould not be included in the numerator of the volumetric formula.Finally, Mr. Kalodner maintains that the numerator should include $100million in crude oil overcharge funds distributed to the states and federalgovernment pursuant to the stipulation and order of dismissal in <T3>Diamond Shamrock Refining andamp; Marketing Co. v. Standard Oil Co.,</T3>No. C2-84-1482 (D. Ohio May 30, 1986). According to Mr. Kalodner,these funds were part of the Settlement Agreement and should be treatedin an indentical manner. We do not agree. The Diamond Shamrock litigationwas entirely separate from the <T3>Stripper Well Exemption Litigation. </T3>The remedy fashioned in <T3>Diamond Shamrock </T3>was distinct from that embodied in the SettlementAgreement, as was the judgment rendered in <T3>United States v. Exxon Corp., </T3>561 F. Supp. 816 (D.D.C. 1983).Just like the overcharges recovered from <T3>Exxon, </T3>which was distributed to the state governments for thebenefits of all consumers, the funds disbursed in <T3>Diamond Shamrock </T3>should not be included in the numerator of thevolumetric formula.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ Mr. Kalodner also contends that any additional funds thatare deposited into the MDL 378 escrow account subsequent to the SettlementAgreement should be added to the numerator. These ``deficiency payments,''Mr. Kalodner argues, are ``part and parcel'' of the Settlement Agreementand must be included in calculating any Subpart V crude oil refunds inorder to maintain ``full parity'' between Subpart V claimants and the MDL378 parties. Kalodner comments at 7-8. The addition of these funds to thenumerator was not suggested in the three PDandamp;Os, and this Decision isnot the proper proceeding in which to make such additions. <T3>See </T3>Tarricone, 15 DOE at 88, 896-97, n.9.After reviewing all of the suggestions of the commenters, we conclude thatin order to maintain ``full parity'' between claimants in MDL 378 and inSubpart V, only $985 million should be added to the numerator of the volumetricformula, in addition to the crude oil violation amounts included in thisDecision.IV. The Refund Procedures<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Refund Claims</ITAG>After considering the comments received, we have concluded that the $130.5million in alleged crude oil violation amounts covered by this Decision,plus the $71.3 million in interest which has accrued on that amount asof December 31, 1987, should be distributed in accordance with the crudeoil refund procedures previously discussed. As noted in the PDandamp;Os,we have decided to reserve initially the full 20 percent of the allegedcrude oil violation amounts, or $26.1 million plus interest, for directrefunds to claimants, in order to ensure that sufficient funds will beavailable for refunds to injured persons. \8\<NOTE/> The amount of the reserve may be adjusted downward laterif circumstances warrant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ As explained below, in certain cases included herein wehave previously distributed 80 percent of the alleged violation amountsto the states and federal government. The remaining 20 percent in thosecases has already been reserved for direct refunds to claimants.The process which the OHA will use to evaluate claims based on allegedcrude oil violations will be modeled after the process the OHA has usedto evaluate claims based on alleged refined product overcharges pursuantto Subpart V. <T3>MAPCO Inc., </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,097 (1986); <T3>Mountain Fuel Supply Co., </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,475 (1986). As in non-crudeoil cases, applicants will be required to document their purchase volumesand demonstrate that they were injured. <T3>See id. </T3>Following Subpart V precedent, reasonable estimates ofpurchase volumes may be submitted. <T3>Greater Richmond Transit Co., </T3>15 DOE andpara; 85,028 (1986). Generally,it is not necessary for applicants to identify their suppliers of petroleumproducts in order to receive a refund. End-users or ultimate consumersof petroleum products whose businesses are unrelated to the petroleum industryand who were not subject to the DOE price regulations are presumed to haveabsorbed rather than passed on alleged crude oil overcharges. In orderto receive a refund, end-users, need not submit any further evidence ofinjury beyond volumes of product purchased in the distribution scheme inwhich the overcharges occurred. <T3>Id. </T3>The end-user presumption of injury is rebuttable, however.<T3>Berry Holding Co., </T3>16 DOE at 88,797. If an interested party submitsevidence which is of sufficient weight to rebut the end-user presumption,the applicant will be required to produce further evidence of injury.Resellers and retailers of petroleum products must submit detailed evidenceof injury, and may not use presumptions of injury established by the OHAin refund cases involving refined petroleum products. They can, however,use ecconometric evidence of the type employed in the OHA Report to theDistrict Court in the Stripper Well Litigation, Fed. Energy Guidelinesandpara;90,507 (June 19, 1985), and the OHA intends to utilize the finaland April 1, 1985 draft reports in evaluating refund applications submittedunder Supart V. <T3>See</T3> Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and Restitution Act of 1986,Pub. L. No. 99-509, Section 3003(b)(2). The presumption used in refinedproduct cases that spot purchasers were not injured by their purchaseswill not be used in the crude oil overchange area. <T3>Tarricone,</T3> 15 DOE at 88,897 (1987).

No. 378 (D. Kan. opinion issued December 7, 1987).Refunds to eligible claimants who purchased refined petroleum productswill be calculated on the basis of a volumetric refund amount derived bydividing the crude oil violation amounts (``the numerator'') by the totalconsumption of petroleum products in the Unted States during the periodof price controls (``the denominator'').\9\<NOTE/> For the reasons discussed above and in the April 10, 1987Notice, henceforth we will include $985 million in the numerator of thevolumetric calculation, in addition to the $130.5 million in principalfrom the cases included in this Decision. This yields a volumetric refundamount of $0.000552 per gallon. In paying claims, we will combine all ofthe volumetric refund amounts obtained in each crude oil refund proceedingimplemented to date under the MSRP, to yield a total per gallon refundamount of $0.0007634, plus interest on that amount.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ We will use the estimate that 2,020,997,335,000 gallonsof petroleum products were consumed in the United States during the periodAugust 1973 through January 1981. <T3>Mountain Fuel, </T3>14 DOE at 88,868 n.4 (1986).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The following per gallon volumetric refund amountswere obtained in prior crude oil refund proceedings:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,6/7,i1,s25,2.10</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Mountain Fuel Supply Co.,</T3> 14 DOE 85,475 (1986) <D>$0.0000004536</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>MAPCO, Inc., </T3> 15 DOE 85,097 (1986) <D>0.000000089</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>Kent Oil andamp; Trading Co.,</T3> 15 DOE 85,100 (1986)<D>0.0000000069</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"><T3>A.

Applicantsclaiming a refund based on a volume of 300,000 gallons or more should submitall of the information in the suggested format of Appendix C and includeall of the information outlined below:(1) Identifying information including the applicant's name, address, andsocial security number of employer number, an indication whether the applicantis a corporation, the name and telephone number of a person to contactfor any additional information, and the name and address to the personwho should receive the refund check;(2) A short description of the applicant's business and how it used petroleumproducts. If the applicant did business under more than one name, or adifferent name during the period of price controls, the applicant shouldlist these names;(3) If the applicant's firm is owned by another company, or owns othercompanies, a list of those other companies' names and their relationshipsto the applicant's firm;(4) A statement identifying the petroleum products which the applicantpurchased during the period August 19, 1973, through January 27, 1981,the number of gallons of each product purchased, and the total number ofgallons for all products purchased on which the applicant bases its claim;(5) An explanation of how the applicant obtained the volume figures above,and an explanation of its method of estimation if the applicant used estimatesto determine its purchase volumes;(6) A statement that neither the applicant, its parent firm, affiliates,subsidiaries, successors nor assigns has wavied any right it may have toreceive a refund in these cases (i.e. that if has not filed for a refundfrom any of the escrow accounts established pursuant to the SettlementAgreement);(7) If the applicant is not an end-user whose business is unrelated tothe petroleum industry, a showing that the applicant was injured by thealleged overcharges (i.e. that the applicant did not pass the overchargesthrough to its own customers); and (8) If the applicant is a regulated utility, a certification that it willnotify the state utility commission of any refund received and that itwill pass on the entirety of its refund to its retail customers.All applications should be typed or printed, clearly labelled ``Applicationfor Crude Oil Refund,'' and mailed to the following address: Subpart VCrude Oil Overcharge Refunds, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Departmentof Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.The volumetric refund amount will be increased as additional crude oilviolation amounts are received in the future. Applicants may be requiredto submit additional information to document their refund claims for presentor future amounts. Notice of additional amounts available in the futurewill be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.B. Payments to the States and Federal GovernmentUnder the terms of the MSRP, the remaining 80 percent of the $130.5 millionplus interest in alleged crude oil violation amounts subject to this Decision,or $104.4 million plus interest, should be disbursed equally to the statesand federal government for indirect restitution. In August 1986, the DOEpaid out $59.3 million of those funds to the states and federal government.\11\<NOTE/> Therefore, $45.1 million of principal remains to be disbursedto those entities. To that amount will be added $17.3 million in interest.\12\<NOTE/> The total amount to be disbursed to the states and federalgovernment pursuant to this determination is therefore $62.4 million ($45.1million in principal plus $17.3 million in interest).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ <T3>See Stripper Well Exemption Litigation</T3>, 14 DOE andpara; 85,382 (1986).In that determination, the OHA ordered, pursuant to paragraph IV.B.7 ofthe Settlement Agreement, the disbursement to the states and federal governmentof 80 percent of the funds in 59 of the subaccounts consolidated in thisDecision. For each subaccount from which an August 1986 payment was made,with one exception noted below, no further refund to the states and federalgovernment is appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ There were 52 accounts from which no advance paymentwas made to the states and federal government in August 1986. The totalinterest which accrued on those accounts, as of December 31, 1987, was$20.9 million. Since the states and federal government will receive 80percent of the principal in those accounts, 80 percent of the interest,or $16.72 million, should also be disbursed to them. To that amount willbe added $582,000 in interest which is available for disbursement to thestates and federal government from the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) subaccount.<T3>See </T3>Appendix B, note 14. The total amount of interest to be disbursedto the states and federal government is therefore $17.3 million ($16.72million plus $582,000).Accordingly, we will direct the DOE's Office of the Controller to segregatethe $62.4 million available for disbursement to the states and federalgovernment and transfer one-half of that amount, or $31.2 million, intoan interest-bearing subaccount for the states, and one-half into an interest-bearingsubaccount for the federal government. In the near future, we will issuea Decision and Order directing the DOE's Office of Controller to make theappropriate disbursements to the individual states from their respectivesubaccount. This future Order is necessary to improve our ability to trackthe various disbursements to the states. Each individual state's percentageshare of the funds to be disbursed is set forth in Exhibit H to the SettlementAgreement and is based on each state's consumption of petroleum productsduring the period of price controls. When disbursed, these funds will besubject to the same use limitations and reporting requirements as all othercrude oil moneys received by the states under the Settlement Agreement.It is therefore ordered that:(1) Applications for Refund from the alleged crude oil overcharge fundsremitted by the firms identified in Appendix B to this Decision and Ordermay now be filed.(2) All applications submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) above must befiled no later than June 30, 1988.(3) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll, Office of DepartmentalAccounting and Financial Systems Development, Office of the Controller,Department of Energy, shall take all steps necessary to transfer, as providedin paragraphs (4) and (5) below, the following amounts:(a) Eighty percent of the total current net equity as of December 31, 1987,from each of the subaccounts (within the Deposit Fund Escrow Account maintainedby the DOE at the Treasury of the United States) listed in Appendix B tothis Decision and Order which are not split pool accounts (split pool accountsare noted with an asterisk) and for which no August 1986 payment is indicated;(b) Eighty percent of the crude oil principal listed in Appendix B, plusthe interest which has accrued on that portion of the crude oil principalthrough December 31, 1987, from each of the subaccounts listed in AppendixB to this Decision and Order which are split pool accounts, except forthe Standard Oil (Indiana) subaccount; and(c) $581,912.13 in interest from the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana) subaccount,Consent Order Number RAMA00010Y.(4) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $31,214,837.17of the funds obtained pursuant to paragraph (3) above, plus interest whichaccrues from January 1, 1988 to the date of disbursement, into the subaccountdenominated ``Crude Tracking-States,'' Number 999DOE003W.(5) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer $31,214,837.17of the funds obtained pursuant to paragraph (3) above, plus interest whichaccrues from January 1, 1988 to the date of disbursement, into the subaccountdenominated ``Crude Tracking-Federal,'' Number 999DOE002W.(6) The Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer into thesubaccount denominated ``Crude Tracking-Claimants,'' Number 999DOE007Z,all of the funds remaining, after the transfers indicated in paragraphs(4) and (5) above, in each of the subaccounts listed in Appendix B to thisDecision, except for those subaccounts which are split pool accounts. Foreach of the split pool accounts, except for the Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)subaccount, the Director of Special Accounts and Payroll shall transfer20 percent of the crude oil principal noted in Appendix B, plus the interestwhich has accrued on that portion of the crude oil principal through thedate of the transfer, into the ``Crude Tracking-Claimants'' subaccount.For the Standard Oil Co.
