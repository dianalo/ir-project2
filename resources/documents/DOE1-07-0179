A 36-year-old man sufferedfrom steady, boring pain behind the left eye for one year. On admissionhe complained of diplopia on the right lateral gaze and hypesthesea ofthe first and second divisions of the left trigeminal nerve. A CT scandemonstrated a slightly high-density lesion, which was homogeneouslyenhanced, in the left cavernous portion and the superior orbital fissure.Carotid angiograms demonstrated no abnormal finding, and the cavernoussinus venography revealed no filling of the left cavernous sinus. A leftfront-temporal craniotomy was performed for the purpose of biopsy. Ahistological examination revealed non-specific focal granulomatous pachymeningitis.He responded dramatically to systemic steroid therapy, and he becamepain-free by the fourth post-operative day. This diagnosis of the Tolosa-Huntsyndrome was confirmed both clinically and etiologically; however, theCT scan after the treatment demonstrated no definitive change in thelesion. The CT scan is useful for the diagnosis of this syndrome. Consideringthe stage of the illness, it is possible that the high-resolution CTscan can demonstrate this lesion with an advanced technique. The clinicaldiagnosis is almost easy, and surgical exploration is not always necessaryif there is a prompt remission upon systemic steroid therapy. However,this syndrome should be differentiated from the other causes by appropriateexaminations. Some cases similar to ours, especially suspected tumors,need surgical exploration because these angiographic findings are notspecific.</TEXT></DOC>
