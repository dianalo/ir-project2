The panel said the ITC's finding relied heavily on&quot;questionable&quot; statistics of increased Canadian porkproduction.</LP><TEXT>   The ITC ruled last year that subsidized exports ofCanadian fresh, chilled and frozen pork threatened to injureU.S. pig producers and meat packers. As a result of theruling, the U.S. put in place countervailing duties of 3.6Canadian cents per pound of processed pork.   The U.S.-Canada panel said the appearance of a bigincrease in Canadian pork production in 1988 was caused by achange in the method of counting and reporting porkproduction by the Canadian government. It said that Canadianpork production grew 8.4% in 1988 from 1986 and not 31% asthought by the ITC. The panel noted that the 8.4% increasewas less than U.S. production growth in the same period.   Martin Rice, executive secretary of the Canadian PorkCouncil, said pork exports to the U.S. are expected todecline this year to about $300 million Canadian dollars(US$265.8 million) from about C$400 million in 1989 becauseof falling production. Canadian pork exports currently makeup less than 3% of the U.S. market.   Mr. Rice said he was &quot;encouraged&quot; by the panel's decisionbecause, he said, it could lead to the removal ofcountervailing duties on Canadian pork exports and boostCanadian production.   The panel instructed the ITC to reconsider the impact ofCanadian subsidies on U.S. pork production taking the smallerproduction statistics into consideration. The ITC has 60 daysto respond to the panel's ruling.   The trade panel was established under the disputesettlement provisions of the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreementwhich went into effect Jan. 1, 1989. The panel included threeCanadian and two U.S. members.   The U.S. government investigation of Canadian pork exportsoriginated from complaints filed by the U.S. National PorkProducers Council which had argued that Canadian packersbenefited from Canadian government subsidies to hog farmers.   The governments of Canada, Alberta, Ontario and Quebec andseveral Canadian industry groups have requested a separateU.S.-Canada panel to review the method used by the U.S. todetermine the level of subsidy to hog farmers.   The Canadian government also has requested a review of thesubsidy issue by a panel of the General Agreement on Tarrifsand Trade, a Geneva organization that regulates trade betweenmost non-socialist countries. According to news reports, theGATT panel has found that the U.S. violated GATT rules inimposing countervailing duties on imports of processed porkto offset government subsidies to pig farmers.   A meeting of the full GATT council is expected to be heldOct. 3 where it will decide to accept or reject the panel'sdecision.</TEXT></DOC>
