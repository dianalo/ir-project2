Scientists from Johns Hopkins University here and AuburnUniversity in Alabama inserted a gene from rainbow trout into carpeggs, creating a fish that grows more quickly.   ``The potential of doing this in other fish could mean billionsof dollars worldwide,'' Dennis Powers, chairman of the biologydepartment at Johns Hopkins University, said Thursday. ``If you canget organisms to grow faster and improve efficiency it will bringdown the price to the consumer.''   The technique could eventually be applied to catfish, a $300million-a-year industry in the South, Powers said.   However, a leading critic of genetic engineering,Washington-based lobbyist Jeremy Rifkin, said if the carp are putinto the natural environment ``that could dramatically change anddisrupt marine life.''   If the altered genes are transmitted to other generations ``theycould overtake the environment,'' said Rikfin, president of theFoundation on Economic Trends.   But Powers said the fact that the fish need substantially morefood means they would likely starve if released into theenvironment rather than being raised at a fish farm.   Powers cautioned that the experiment is just a ``preliminarystudy'' and said he and his colleagues have not yet determinedwhether the altered gene can be passed on to future generations ofcarp.   The scientists injected a gene from the pituitary gland ofrainbow trout into carp eggs. The gene produces additional growthhormone, which regulates the growth of the fish.   The technique for putting the gene into the carp eggs is stillimprecise, with only 20 successes in 10,000 attempts. Thescientists hope to produce more altered carp before publishing astudy.   Rex Dunham, a fisheries geneticist at Auburn University, saidthere was no particular reason for choosing a donor gene fromtrout, except that it was more interesting to try a gene from adifferent species. He said he thought the same result could havebeen achieved by inserting an extra carp growth hormone gene.   Powers and the two other scientists involved in the experiment,Dunham and Thomas Chen, a molecular biologist at the Center ofMarine Biotechnology at John Hopkins, have asked the U.S.Department of Agriculture to allow them to release the carp intoexperimental ponds to see how the fish fare outdoors.   Powers said the fish would be isolated and would not allowed toescape from the holding ponds to lakes and streams, but Rifkin saidthere is not enough assurance of that and wants the petition denied.   Chinese scientists last year proved that genes from otheranimals can change the physical and chemical processes in fish.   Scientists have also successfully mixed genes from differentspecies in warm-blooded animals, such as rodents and livestock, andmicrobes and plants.</TEXT></DOC>
