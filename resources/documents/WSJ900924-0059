Such an arrangement, with top Saudi and U.S. officersessentially becoming vice commanders and sharing power undera central structure, would have important symbolic andmilitary implications.</LP><TEXT>   In addition to the top tier, other countries with troopsin Saudi Arabia presumably would be represented in this newarrangement, giving them a larger political stake and achance to participate more formally in important decisions,these officials said. Proponents also contend there would beimproved coordination and more clear-cut control overBritish, French and Arab troops.   Senior U.S. and Saudi officials haven't agreed on aspecific plan, and any decision is probably weeks away. Butthe issue became the focus of renewed attention over theweekend in the wake of complaints by British and Americanofficers about the current makeshift command arrangements.   Regardless of the outcome, American forces are certain toremain under the direct control of the U.S. In the same way,Saudi leaders have insisted from the beginning of the Gulfcrisis that they must maintain command over their ownsoldiers. But with more than 50,000 additional troops slatedto arrive soon from Britain, France, Egypt and Syria, theproposals under discussion could significantly improve theoverall readiness of the multinational forces.   Meanwhile, Saudi military and government leaders havestepped up private messages urging the Bush administration totake military action against Iraq if economic sanctions don'tproduce clear-cut results in the next few weeks. Some Saudileaders, according to one government official, weeks agocalled on Western countries to cut off commercial and mailservice to Iraq. They also warned the White House that thefragile Arab coalition opposing Iraq may begin to erode ifthe standoff stretches into next year, this official said.   The sensitive question of who is in charge of the growinginternational strike force became public after Britishdefense chief Tom King highlighted the issue during a meetinglast week with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Mr. King agreedthat British forces would be under day-to-day Americancontrol in most combat situations, but he also suggested thata broader arrangement may be in the works that would put aBritish officer &quot;in the overall command structure&quot; in SaudiArabia.   French Defense Minister Jean Pierre Chenvenement, on theother hand, before leaving for a visit to the Middle Eastsaid last week that his government will retain &quot;autonomy ofdecision and autonomy of action&quot; regarding almost 5,000specially trained desert fighters France is sending to SaudiArabia.   If fighting breaks out, a single chain of command may beessential to transform this hodgepodge of soldiers, tanks andaircraft from at least 11 countries into an effectivefighting force. &quot;The British have prompted a lot moreattention to the whole question of a unified command,&quot; onesenior military official said, adding: &quot;But it's still in theearly talking stages.&quot;   In the meantime, Saudi and U.S. commanders have assignedtheir ground forces to defend specific sections of thenortheastern border with Kuwait, and the two countries areconducting separate but coordinated 24-hour patrols byfighter jets to guard against Iraqi air attacks. Britishpilots are flying their own missions alongside the two otherair forces.   A number of U.S. and British pilots, however, havecomplained to reporters that existing procedures may beunworkable in combat because it would take too long for themto receive authorization from U.S. and Saudi groundcommanders to fire on hostile planes.   American naval commanders have tried for weeks, apparentlywith only limited success to obtain European approval of adetailed plan outlining how Western warships can work moreclosely together to interdict Iraqi shipping in the Gulf.   Without creating a single, well-defined command structure,&quot;missions will be duplicated and {some of the vessels} willbe at risk for the lack of an organized defense againstpossible Iraqi attacks,&quot; according to a report released lastweek by a European parliamentary group.   Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the commander in chief of U.S.forces in the region, has said, &quot;there isn't one supremecommander&quot; in Saudi Arabia &quot;and there doesn't need to beone.&quot; But other U.S. and Saudi officials stressed that hisSaudi counterpart, Gen. Khaled bin Sultan, the top Arabcommander, only recently assembled a full-fledged staff tohelp him deal with the complex problems of coordinatingforeign troops.   While emphasizing that the current system is working well,Mr. Cheney told reporters earlier this month that &quot;if itbecomes necessary in this instance&quot; to set up a unifiedcommand, &quot;I'm certain we could work something out.&quot;   In Washington, a spokesman for Gen. Colin Powell, chairmanof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said, &quot;I don't sense that thereis any movement at this end&quot; to change the currentarrangements. But like Mr. Cheney, he left the door open forpossible changes as the military situation evolves.</TEXT></DOC>
