The Agreement on Cooperation in Science and Technology will beendorsed when President Reagan and Japanese Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita meet privately at the seven-nation economic summit June20 in Toronto, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Yoshifumi Matsuda.   U.S. and Japanese officials finished 10 months of negotiationswith a new five-year agreement to replace a pact that wastemporarily renewed five times since it expired in 1985.   Under the new agreement, Japan will open up its public andprivate laboratories to American researchers and increase fundingfor scientists and engineers coming to Japan.   Private industry accounts for 80 percent of the funds Japaninvests in research and development, compared to 50 percent in theUnited States. As a result, the U.S. government has been pushingfor more access to private laboratories where the bulk of Japaneseresearch takes place.   U.S. negotiators also won a major concession in talks to renewthe pact when Japan agreed to restrict publication of sensitivematerial on jointly developed technology.   The Japanese government has come under attack for what criticssay are lax controls on exports of sensitive technology tocommunist nations in violation of a Western accord.   Last year, U.S. officials disclosed that Toshiba Machine Co., asubsidiary of the major Japanese electronics maker Toshiba Corp.,had been exporting submarine-silencing equipment to the SovietUnion.   Under the new pact, due to take effect when the currentthree-month extension ends this month, both countries also agree toprotect intellectual rights and determine rights to patents arisingfrom joint research before the start of laboratory work.</TEXT></DOC>
