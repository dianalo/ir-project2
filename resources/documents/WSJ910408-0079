Yet the coming pullout of American forces also is creatinganother difficult refugee problem for the Bushadministration, U.S. officials acknowledge. The U.S. forcesoccupying part of southern Iraq have been giving haven tosome 40,000 Iraqis who have fled the violent uprisingsagainst Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, and the administrationis scrambling to devise a plan for protecting those refugeesfrom reprisals by the Iraqi government once U.S. troopsleave.</LP><TEXT>   Iraq declared in a letter to the U.N. Security Council onSaturday that it intends to accept the long and complexcease-fire resolution passed last week by the SecurityCouncil. Iraq complained bitterly about terms of theresolution, which calls for an indefinite arms embargo onIraq, destruction of its most lethal weapons, and a diversionof future oil revenue to pay war reparations.   The Security Council could possibly decide that thelengthy complaints Iraq made in its letter of acceptanceamount to unacceptable conditions and that the letter will berejected. Brent Scowcroft, President Bush's national securityadviser, said on NBC's &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that &quot;whether some ofthe complaints are conditions or not will have to be workedout.&quot; The Security Council is to meet soon to decide theissue.   But Iraq's letter seems very likely to be judged as theformal acceptance required to complete the cease-fire. Mr.Scowcroft said that Iraq declared at the end of its lengthyletter that it hasn't any choice but to accept theresolution.   In the short term, U.S. officials say, they consider thecease-fire resolution most important because it will allowAmerican troops to withdraw rapidly from southern Iraq. TheBush administration is eager to move soldiers away from theinternal strife there, partly to ease pressure and complaintsfrom critics who charge that the U.S. should be using itsmilitary muscle in the region to help Shiite and Kurdish foesof Saddam Hussein, who have been savagely beaten back by theIraqi army.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on ABC's &quot;This Week WithDavid Brinkley,&quot; defended the administration's position notto take action. &quot;For us to get American military personnelinvolved in a civil war inside Iraq would literally be aquagmire.&quot; He added that &quot;it makes no sense&quot; for Americanforces to take casualties in an effort to take over a countrythat the U.S. isn't prepared to reorganize politically orotherwise.   In a reflection of his eagerness to get soldiers out ofIraq, President Bush said over the weekend that thewithdrawal would be a matter &quot;of days, not a matter of monthsor weeks or anything of that nature.&quot; Some American soldiersalready have been pulled out of Iraq, and the rest will leaveas soon as a U.N. observer force of about 300 officers and1,000 or so troops arrives.   A small number of U.S. officers might be included in theobserver force, Mr. Bush said. The other permanent members ofthe Security Council also are considering contributingofficers to the force, though the bulk of the soldiers arelikely to come from smaller countries and Arab nations.   Yet it remains unclear who will protect the refugees insouthern Iraq, many of them Shiite Muslims. The Bushadministration, already smarting from charges that it hasabandoned Kurdish rebels in the north, can ill afford to openitself to charges that it is leaving another group ofdissident Iraqis in the lurch.   Mr. Scowcroft declared that Iraqi refugees in the south&quot;will not be abandoned.&quot; But he said it still isn't clearwhat will be done to protect the refugees, though hesuggested they might be moved into the region along theIraq-Kuwait border to be patrolled by the U.N. observerforce. That region is to extend about six miles into Iraq andthree miles into Kuwait.   In response to criticism that the U.S. was ignoring itsresponsibility for the Kurds in the north, President Bushannounced Friday an emergency aid package. He said that AirForce transport planes are beginning to drop emergencysupplies such as blankets and tents to Kurdish refugees, andthat the administration would release emergency relief fundsfor more assistance, contribute to the Red Cross for avaccination drive and perhaps send medical teams to helpKurds fleeing to Turkey.   Turkish President Turgut Ozal said over the weekend thatTurkey had let between 150,000 and 200,000 Kurdish refugeesfrom Iraq cross into Turkey. But he said Turkey won'tresettle them in camps deep inside the country, as it hasalready done for 40,000 Kurds who had fled Iraq in previousyears. &quot;The problem is there are rugged mountains on theTurkish side of the border, so {there is} very limited spacefor camps,&quot; he said.   The reopening of Iraq's economy will be a process thatproceeds much more slowly than either the militarydisengagement or assistance to refugees.   Under terms of the cease-fire resolution, it will takeweeks for Iraq to begin selling its oil and importing mostcivilian merchandise. Even then, Iraq's ability to resumecommerce will depend on its behavior in meeting U.N. demandsfor destroying its weapons and funneling oil revenue to warreparations.   Over the next month or so, the resolution states, Iraqmust provide an inventory of its chemical and biologicalweapons and nuclear arms materials, and the U.N. is to set upa commission to supervise seizure of those materials. At thesame time, the U.N. secretary-general is to set a plan fordiverting a portion of Iraq's oil revenue to pay for wardamages.   Only after Iraq has cooperated in both the cataloging anddestruction of the weapons and the plan for diverting oilrevenue is the general U.N. embargo on purchases of Iraqi oilto be lifted. Some small sales of oil might be permitted inthe meantime to finance purchases of food and medicine.   In about two months, the Security Council will review thegeneral embargo on shipments of nonessential civilian goodsto Iraq. And even after that, the cease-fire resolution laysout a procedure for the Security Council to lift the ban onshipments to Iraq in slow stages.   Meanwhile, Mr. Scowcroft deflected suggestions that theBush administration should become more assertive in pushingfor democratic reforms in the Kuwaiti state. In histelevision appearance, he suggested the administration hastold Kuwaiti leaders of their desire for free elections butwants to have the Kuwaitis &quot;put their own house in orderrather than have Uncle Sam stage-manage&quot; changes in thecountry.   Yesterday, in his first public address since the alliesousted Iraq from Kuwait, the emir of Kuwait pledged torestore parliamentary democracy and to hold elections by theend of next year. Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, in anationally broadcast speech, also said he would consider thepossibility of giving political rights to women.</TEXT></DOC>
