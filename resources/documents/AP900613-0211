In recent years, he's seen a soil-parching drought that witheredcrops in the field, and rains that left farm land a muddy mess,delaying planting and cutting yields.   He has watched friends lose their farms, and helped comforttheir families while their possessions were sold at auction.   Through such uncertainty, Smith and his family find strengththrough Jesus and ``The Way of the Cross for Those in Rural Life,''a 32-page religious pamphlet written by farmers and others involvedin agriculture.   ``We make mistakes and we fall. Jesus fell three times on hisway to the cross and every time he fell he got back up. That's theway we look at trouble we've having on the farm. You have to pickyourself back up when you fall,'' the 39-year-old father of twosaid in an interview.   This is the second year the pamphlet has been published by theRoman Catholic Diocese of Toledo's Rural Life Ministries, anorganization that helps farmers and migrant farm workers.   Sister Christine Pratt, ministries' director, said the bookletis popular with people engaged in agriculture. It is used in manyrural parishes for devotional services.   ``It is a spiritual walk with Jesus along the traditionalstations of Jesus' trial, sufferings, death and resurrection, butincludes meditations written by growers, dairy people, and otherswho are sensitive to the dependence on the growing cycles ofnature,'' Sister Pratt said.   The idea of publishing the pamphlet came to her in the summer of1988 when a drought threatened the livelihoods of many farmers.   Farm couples or individuals involved in food issues and migrantfarm workers were asked to write their feelings, based on Scriptureinvolving Jesus' walk to his crucifixion.   The booklet is popular with farmers because the passages arewritten by people who understand the pain they go through, she said.   ``They are written by our brothers, our sisters, our neighbors,our friends _ people who have been able to help us see how we cantake the passion of Jesus and identify with it in a way that isclose to our own experience,'' she said.   ``I have given them to individual farmers, whether they beCatholic or Protestant. Many of them are in the middle offoreclosures and I give it to them to pray over, so they know thatsomeone else is sharing what they're going through,'' she said.   Smith and his wife, Jane, 37, wrote a passage for the booklet,based on when Jesus starts on his way to Calvary.   ``Jesus silently accepted the rough wooden cross, though he hadcommitted no wrong. Consider the farmer and the farm family whodepend on variables out of their control. The weather,international trade and government policies have all affected thefarmer,'' the Smiths wrote.   ``As a result, many farmers or their spouses have been forced tofind work off the farm to supplement their income. In dealing withthis stress, some farmers withdraw from family and friends and facethe loneliness that Jesus must have felt when betrayed by Peter.''   Mrs. Smith, 37, recalls when she and her husband wrote thepassage.   ``It was during the drought, when farmers were having so muchtrouble through a variety of things. I saw several friendsexperience anguish. I sat down and prayed about it, and this iswhat I thought of and decided to contribute,'' she said.   Whenever the Smiths feel depressed about problems on their800-acre dairy farm, they take solace in the pamphlet.   ``It's beautiful because of the contributions from so manypeople. It helps us pray to the Lord. We can all associate with thesufferings of Christ,'' she said.   Farmers in the past decade contended with foreclosures, landdepreciation, inflation, low commodity prices, bad weather andshrinking markets.   Agricultural experts say conditions should improve in the 1990s,but more for commercial farmers than the small part time or familyfarmer.   ``It's rough for many farmers,'' Smith said. ``Some don't thinkthings will get much better. But you always have to have hope. Whenyou fall, you have to get up.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs June 15.</NOTE></DOC>
