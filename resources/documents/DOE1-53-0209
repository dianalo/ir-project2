The value of {gamma} ( = C/T) in 24 T is 350 mJ/mol K{sup2}. The slope of the C/T-vs-T{sup 2} data, proportional to the Debyetemperature, in 24 T is the same as that for LaCu{sub 6} in zero field,with no low-temperature upturn in the C/T data in 24 T observed. Thesedata indicate that we achieve complete suppression of the heavy-fermionground state in CeCu{sub 6} with this high applied magnetic field. Theseresults are in sharp contrast with results on uranium systems, indicatinga fundamental difference in the heavy-fermion ground state. Implicationsfor de Haas-van Alphen experiments are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
