Hillside shantytowns known as ``ranchos'' never vanished _ infact, they multiplied _ as oil gushed up and dollars rushed in. Butmansions of the wealthy became more sumptuous and their inhabitantsmore frivolous.   Not only did they import Scotch whisky, they also imported waterfrom the Scottish Highlands to go with it.   And so, on Feb. 27, 11 days after newspapers ran accounts ofCaracas' ``Wedding of the Century'' _ a reception for 3,500 guests,200 of them flown in at their hosts' expense from as far away asTahiti _ the ranchos exploded.   Their protests of increases in bus fares and the prices ofgasoline and other basics turned into the bloodiest civil unrest inVenezuela's recent history. By official count, at least 256 peoplewere killed and 2,000 wounded. Other quarters say the death tollmight have exceeded 300.   ``The luxury of the few has become an insult to the misery of themasses,'' said a post-riot document of the Roman Catholic Church,among the most conservative in Latin America.   President Carlos Andres Perez, who returned to office in Januaryafter a term in 1974-79, called the five days of violence a struggleof ``the poor against the rich.''   He later modified his remark, but the original intent remainedillustrative of what went wrong: Venezuela's oil wealth had notfiltered down to the masses.   Resentment among the poor grew stronger as real wages steadilyshrank by as much as 30 percent since 1980, putting health care andhousing out of reach of the poor. An estimated 41 percent ofVenezuela's 18 million people live in slums.   But for the rich, life did not change as the economy weakenedwith the collapse of oil prices.   The wedding of Mariela Cisneros, daughter of Oswaldo Cisneros,president of Pepsi-Cola's Venezuelan subsidiary, and GonzaloFernandez, from a prosperous business family, reflected high-classlife in Venezuela. Guests were served imported Scotch, vintageFrench wines and the finest delicacies from abroad.   Perez's own inauguration, called ``the coronation'' to whichdozens of world leaders, including Vice President Dan Quayle andFidel Castro, were invited, gave the illusion of a return of thatthe happy days of affluence, which reached a high point during hisfirst administration.   ``Overwhelmed by wholesale promises during last year's electioncampaign, people expected nothing but bonanza,'' said Anibal Romero,professor of political science at Simon Bolivar University inCaracas. ``It has been a sudden and bitter awakening for all ofthem,''   As the world's eighth-largest oil producer, Venezuela for yearsprovided its people with Latin America's highest standard of living,subsidizing everything from eggs to limousines. Oil allowedgovernment after government to conceal the ills of a developingnation.   ``We were falsifying the economy because oil allowed us to doso,'' the novelist and essayist Arturo Uslar Pietri was quoted astelling the Caracas newspaper El Universal. ``It led people tobelieve prices wouldn't go up, that the government would subsidizethem.''   A lifestyle supported by oil wealth made possible all kinds ofeconomic eccentricities.   Until early this decade, Venezuela imported most of its food,including potato chips, pears and cherries from the United States.   But the poor did not benefit significantly from those affluentyears. According to official figures, as of last year four out of 10Venezuelans lived in the adobe and brick ranchos on the slopesringing Caracas and other major cities.   ``An accusatory crown of thorns,'' the Roman Catholic Churchcalled them in a housing study published before the riots.   In the church's post-riot document, published March 9, ArchbishopJose Ali Lebrun and 20 other priests assailed what they called ``thewidening gap between poor and rich'' and said Venezuela's $33billion foreign debt should not be the burden of the poor.   ``We remind economic and political leaders that they have a dutyto give examples of austerity and honesty ... so that the terribleburden of sacrifices the country must make because of its foreigndebt will not be borne by weak and poor sectors alone,'' thedocument said.   Nearly half of Caracas' 4 million people live in ranchos. Mostmigrated from rural areas and neighboring Colombia seeking a betterlife, as a result of economic policies that for years neglected thecountryside in favor of urban and industrial growth subsidized byoil.   Perez's remarks blaming the riots on a class struggle stirredfurious protests from the private sector.   ``You ... who are leading the nation for the second time shouldbe proud that there still are rich people,'' said Fedecamaras, abusiness association, in an unusually harsh letter to Perez. ``Itwould be incomprehensible to have only poor people after thegigantic resources oil has provided us.''   ``It is dangerous to defy poverty,'' Perez responded.   But it was his government's economic measures that led to thedisorders. On Feb. 16, Perez had announced an austerity program thatincluded the end of subsidies on basic food items, public servicesand gasoline. The government action increased bus fares by 30percent but private owners raised theirs 100 to 200 percent. Perezsaid the measures were necessary to keep the country from headinginto an inflationary spiral.   As the Caracas upheaval spread across the nation, people livingin the wealthy east side of Caracas formed armed defense brigades.An Associated Press reporter saw some members of the brigadescarrying sub-machine guns, rifles, pistols and machetes.   Until the outbursts, it had been commonplace to hear Venezuelanscomment that ``some day'' the people of the ranchos would descend onthe city in rage. But few imagined it would be so bad.   ``Now the rich will no longer flaunt their opulence so easily,''said political scientist Romero.   Others think the time has come to leave the country, which justfew years ago was attracting thousands from Italy, Spain, Portugalother South American nations.   ``I am afraid we're going to have social turbulence for awhile,'' said Manuel del Canto, a transport executive. ``I don'twant to stay here for the next explosion.''   But he added: ``We Venezuelans are too late to join theimmigration currents to the U.S. or Europe. The Argentines,Brazilians, Chileans or Mexicans are already filling the quotas.''   Indeed, at least one travel agency anticipates an outward rush.It ran an advertisement in newspapers offering ``Chileans,Argentines, Uruguayans, Portuguese, Italians, Spanish'' a special``operation return'' to their home countries.   ``We have received numerous calls asking for information aboutour return plan,'' said an official of the Chasqui travel agency inCaracas.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, March 19</NOTE></DOC>
