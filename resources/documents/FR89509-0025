L. 100-430,102 Stat. 1619, 1625 (approved September 13, 1988)). Section 817 provides,among other things, that the Secretary may utilize the services of responsibleState and local agencies in the enforcement of the Fair Housing laws, and``may reimburse such agencies and their employees for services renderedto assist him in carrying out'' the Fair Housing Act.The Federal-State-local approach to eliminating housing discriminationis further enhanced by section 810(f)(3)(A). Section 810(f)(3)(A) providesthat ``The Secretary may certify an agency [for the referral of complaintsof discriminatory housing practices] * * * if the Secretary determinesthat:(i) The substantive rights protected by such agency in the jurisdictionwith respect to which certification is to be made;(ii) The procedures followed by such agency;(iii) The remedies available to such agency; and(iv) The availability of judicial review of such agency's action;are substantially equivalent to those created by and under [Title VIII].Since promulgation of the proposed rule on September 7, 1988, the FairHousing Amendments Act of 1988 was adopted, adding two new protected classesto the prohibitions on discrimination contained in Title VIII. The newlegislation makes it unlawful to discriminate in the sale, rental or financingof housing because of handicap or familial status. Title VIII previouslyoutlawed discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or nationalorigin. This rule now reflects the inclusion of ``handicap'' and ``familialstatus'' as additional protected classes. See andSection; 111.115(a)(6).<ITAG tagnum="84">The proposed rule</ITAG>The Department published a proposed rule (53 FR 34668, September 7, 1988)that discussed the need for revision of the existing FHAP and that described,among other things, the new funding approach to be adopted. The rule invitedpublic comment on the proposed revisions. Ten comments were received_sevenfrom State agencies, two from local agencies, and one from an associationrepresenting human rights agencies. These comments and the Department'sresponses are summarized below.Public Comments<ITAG tagnum="81">General</ITAG>One commenter made the general observation that the current system of competitiveand non-competitive funding has worked well, rewarding with Type II fundingthose agencies that have operated an ``excellent program.'' The commenterargued that the rationale advanced for revising the FHAP is flawed in manyways. Especially troubling to the commenter is the possibility that theability of successful programs to continue carrying out effective antidiscriminationprograms would be seriously affected. The commenter's fear is that fundingmay be reduced for programs as a result of the rule's creating the requirementto divide up the ``pool of money'' among more agencies, regardless of merit.The Department has carefully considered this commenter's arguments, butremains persuaded that the success of fair housing enforcement effortswould be better served by the comprehensive funding approach adopted inthis rule, and discussed at length in the preamble to the proposed rule.See 53 FR 34668. Further, the Department believes that the additional eligibilitycriteria in andSection; 111.113 estabished for all otherwise eligible agenciesin the incentive component decrease the likelihood of fostering any disproportionateweight which might be due to ``grantsmanship''.Three other comments generally supported the need for revising the FHAPto make it a non-competitive program. One commenter questioned whetherthe ``FHAP will be improved administratively except at the headquarterslevel,'' fearing ``lengthy applications for funds and time-consuming reportingregarding overall fund usage.'' The Department does not view the rule'srequirements as imposing unnecessarily burdensome requirements on agencies.However, responsible management of Federal funds requires that HUD is fullyapprised of the intended and actual use of funds disbursed to local andState agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Training funds</ITAG>Several of the commenters took issue with the provision (andSection; 111.105(b)(1))relating to training funds. Proposed andSection; 111.105(b)(1) provided that``All contributions agencies will receive the same amount of financialsupport for HUD-sponsored or HUD-approved fair housing training subjectto a demonstration of need.'' Commenters contended that it would be inequitableto give all agencies, regardless of size, the same amount of training funds.In their view, training funds should be awarded based on, among other things,the number of personnel assigned to process housing discrimination complaintsand the complexity of the complaints investigated by an agency. A furthercomment in this regard was that HUD should adopt a broader approach tothe use of training funds to include any activity that would further the``administration of justice.'' Another commenter urged HUD to allow trainingfunds to be used not only for HUD-sponsored training, but for any publicor private training that increases an agency's ability to enforce its fairhousing laws. In a final note, a commenter proposed a formula for awardingtraining funds based on the amount of incentive funds received by an agency.The Department recognizes that these comments offer attractive policy choices,but after due consideration HUD has decided to retain the proposed languageof andSection; 111.105(a)(1). In HUD's view, any formula that is developedto apportion training funds among the various agencies will result in largeragencies receiving an increased share while at the same time decreasingthe share that goes to smaller agencies. More particularly, the Departmentviews its provision of training funds as intended to <T3>support </T3>agencies' training efforts, not subsidize their totaltraining costs. This provision is consistent with HUD's current policyof supporting, without subsidizing in full, local agency efforts to improvethe efficiency of their fair housing enforcement personnel.The requirement to train a certain number of persons now found in andSection;111.105(b)(1) will ensure that only agencies that achieve a required levelof participation in HUD-sponsored training will receive the training funds.To promote clarity in the rule, the phrase ``subject to a demonstrationof need'' in proposed andSection; <T3>111.105(b)(1) has been replaced by this new requirement.</T3>Finally, the necessity for HUD approval of the expenditure of FHAP fundsfor any training other than HUD-sponsored training will ensure that expendituresare better accounted for, and will decrease the potential for misuse offunds. HUD's approval of other training will be based on the Department'sconcurrence with the agency's need for training. As in the past, all approvedtraining must relate to the administration of an agency's fair housingprogram.<ITAG tagnum="84">Incentive funds</ITAG>Several comments were received on andSection; 111.105(b)(3) relating to ``Incentivefunds.'' One commenter was concerned that the census data that HUD woulduse may be outdated, and thus inaccurate. Another commenter argued thatlocal and State government funding should be the only non-federal fundingfor enforcement of fair housing laws. The commenter pointed out that fundingis seldom earmarked specifically for fair housing law enforcement, butrather for salaries, rent, etc., thus making it difficult to determinethe portion that is specifically budgeted for fair housing activities.These factors, along with the fact that often a State or local governmentcontribution is in-kind, and not in cash, make it difficult to developand implement a fair matching funds formula. This commenter also urgedHUD to consider, besides population, the size and relative amount of fairhousing enforcement activity of different jurisdictions in determiningfunding levels.Another commenter found the matching concept in andSection; 111.105(b)(3)to be a ``mystery'', because each agency was proposed to be paid a fixedamount, notwithstanding the rule's reference to population size and numberof cases processed. This commenter also expressed skepticism about whetherthe new funding approach actually would be non-competitive, pointing tothe rule's allowing ``cash contributions from non-Federal sources'' aspromoting competition and divisiveness among agencies for State and localfunds. The commenter's final criticism of the matching formula was thatit implicitly countenanced the raising of private funds by agencies which,in the commenter's view, is not ``an appropriate action [for] a publicagency.''In response to these comments, the Department would underscore that proposedandSection; 111.105(b)(3) added parenthetically that ``HUD will use the most<T3>recent </T3>census data to determine a jurisdiction's population.''(Emphasis supplied.) To allay the commenter's misgivings, the cited sentencehas been revised to read, in relevant part, ``the most recent availableU.S. census data.'' It should be emphasized that the phrase ``the mostrecent available U.S. census data'' is not limited to the decennial census,but contemplates the latest updated population figures, thereby allowingHUD to calculate the incentive component more accurately.Because of the several infirmities raised by commenters with respect tothe matching formula, the rule has been revised to remove the provisionrelating to ``HUD's matching of the cash contributions generated from non-Federalsources.'' Also removed is the language that indicated HUD would providea formula to be used to distribute matching incentive funds. Instead ofa formula, the rule now provides that an applicant for incentive fundsmust certify, on the basis of the supporting documentation submitted, thatthe agency qualifies for incentive funds because a minimum percentage offunds expended by the agency for fair housing activities during the agency'smost recently concluded fiscal year was from non-Federal sources. The minimumpercentage will be set forth in the annual Notice of Funding Availability(NOFA). This provision was removed from andSection; 111.105(b)(3) of theproposed rule and now more appropriately appears, as revised, in a newparagraph (e)(3) of andSection; 111.111 of this final rule.HUD is unsure of the point of the comment that allowing contributions fromnon-Federal sources would promote competition and divisiveness among agencies.If the commenter means that this provision would encourage competitionamong fair housing agencies for non-Federal dollars, HUD disagrees. Ifthe commenter means that fair housing agencies will be competing with otherState and local agencies for non-Federal (<T3>i.e., </T3>State and local) funds, HUD would respond that such ``competition''is a necessary function of the budget process in virtually every Stateand locality. The rule's reference to ``non-Federal'' funds contemplatedfunds appropriated from a public source, as opposed to funding from private(<T3>i.e., </T3>non-governmental) sources. (Except that, for purposes ofthis rule, Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds used to supportfair housing activities will be treated as non-Federal funds.)In the Department's view, using private funds to assist in the enforcementof fair housing laws is not an inappropriate action for a public agency,if such action is permissible under the relevant laws of the agency's jurisdiction.Nothing in this rule discourages private citizens from donating, and Statesand localities from accepting, funds to support fair housing activities.A commenter speculated that ``State and local agencies in those stateswith both kinds of agencies [<T3>i.e., </T3>State and local fair housing agencies] will receive proportionatelymore money than those states having only a state level enforcement agency.''The commenter sought assurance that HUD will ensure that incentive ``fundsare not provided to two or three agencies at different levels for the samepopulation.''To the extent there are two or more fair housing agencies within a largerpolitical jurisdiction which itself has smaller political jurisdictionseach with its own fair housing agency, HUD will award incentive funds basedon the population of each local jurisdiction served by the respective fairhousing agencies.<ITAG tagnum="84">Complaint processing funds</ITAG>On the issue of ``Complaint processing funds'' (andSection;111.105(b)(2)),a commenter pointed out that the rule does not provide for an additionalcontribution if an agency processed more dual-filed cases in a contractyear than in the previous year on which the funding was based.HUD acknowledges that, because of budgetary constraints, additional contributionsmay not be forthcoming within a contract year although, as the commenterobserved, more dual-filed cases may have been processed in that year. Thefollowing fiscal year, an agency's contributions portion could increaseproportionately, reflecting the previous year's caseload. The Departmentwould add that the intent of this section is to advise participating agenciesof the period to be used in calculating case processing levels. Also, HUDhas determined that, for administrative convenience, it would be betterto use HUD's fiscal year as the period of reference for determining theamount of complaint processing funds. Section 111.105(b)(2) now reflectsthat change.<ITAG tagnum="84">Funding of capacity building agencies</ITAG>Section 111.105(a), ``Funding of capacity building agencies,'' has beenrevised, and now provides that an application for funds from a capacitybuilding agency must state the objectives and activities to be carriedout by the applicant. These activities must include participation in HUD-sponsoredtraining, complaint monitoring and reporting systems (CMRS), and case processing.The application also must show any other activities proposed to be undertakenby the applicant. This revision will ensure that HUD is fully apprisedof the intended use of funds given to these agencies, as it is with theother agencies the Department funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applications</ITAG>Commenters contended that the application process in andSection;111.111(a)would be unwieldly and expensive, consuming more resources than the grantitself. Complaint was voiced in particular with reference to the requirementof preapplication citizen comments and alternative project proposals. Itis the agencies that are charged with monitoring fair housing matters,the commenters argued, not citizens. Thus, if the proposed provision remains,it could result in citizens' and organizations' dictating to agencies aboutthe structure and development of their fair housing programs.In the Department's view, citizen participation in the development of afair housing program would be beneficial to all. However, the Departmentis mindful also that agencies with expert knowledge and relevant experienceshould be instrumental in designing the programs that they have ultimateresponsibility for enforcing. To achieve these two complementary goals,the rule has been revised by removing the last sentence in proposed andSection;111.111(a),and substituting the following language: ``Eligible agencies must, uponrequest by a responsible party, make available a copy of the applicationsubmission.''A new paragraph (e)(3) is added in andSection;111.111 to state that an applicantfor incentive funds must certify, on the basis of the supporting documentationsubmitted, that the agency qualifies for incentive funds because a minimumpercentage of funds spent by the agency for fair housing activities inthe agency's most recently concluded fiscal year was from non-Federal sources.Also in andSection;111.111, paragraph (f)(2) has been revised to includelanguage that more clearly spells out current practice with respect tothe awarding of funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Additional eligibility criteria</ITAG>A comment suggested that since the rule did not specify, in proposed andSection;111.113(a)(1),``a stated number of dual-filed complaints,'' and since, in the commenter'sview, it would be inappropriate to do so in a NOFA, HUD should publisha proposed rule setting forth the minimum number of complaints that wouldbe acceptable. Another commenter recommended that both received and initiatedcomplaints be accepted and counted towards a minimum number of ten casesthat, in the commenter's view, would be necessary for an agency to qualifyfor funding under andSection;111.113(a)(1). Proposed andSection;111.113(a)(1)provided that:(a) In addition to the criteria set forth in andSection;111.107, applicantsfor incentive funds must demonstrate that they have, during a 12 consecutivemonth period designated by HUD in the NOFA_(1) Processed a stated minimum number of dual-filed complaints. The numberof complaints (which will be based on separate minimums for States andfor localities) will be set forth in the NOFA. To be considered a processedcomplaint, a complaint must have been filed in accordance with 24 CFR 105.15-105.17and accepted for closure by the Regional Office;HUD does not believe that the absence of a stated minimum in the proposedrule requires publication of another proposed rule announcing the minimum.The proposed rule clearly gave notice that agencies would have to processa minimum, though unstated, number of complaints. Since agencies were soinformed, they were thus free to comment on, or suggest (as one commenterdid) a figure that they believed should be an acceptable minimum. Onlyone commenter chose to do so, and its suggestion was limited to a minimumfor local agencies only, not for State agencies. More importantly, whilethe Department would have considered any suggested minimums, the Departmentwould not have bound itself to accept any, because the task of settinga minimum in this regard is one that is fully committed to this Department'sdiscretion in its position as administrator of the FHAP.  There is a further reason not to include a stated minimum in this rule.HUD's experience is that there is wide fluctuation from year to year inthe number of dual-filed complaints processed. Consequently, HUD believesthat the minimum number of dual-filed complaints should not be fixed ina regulation, thus eliminating the costly requirement of annually revisingthe regulation to accommodate the changing minimums. The annual minimumwill be discussed with all fair housing agencies at the annual FHAP policyconference, and HUD's determination will be based on the amount of fundsappropriated. The announcement of the minimum will be made in the NOFA. Both received and initiated complaints may count towards the minimum ifthey otherwise meet the processing requirements of the rule. The finalrule will continue to count only ``processed complaints'' because supportof the complaint processing activities of State and local agencies is theprimary purpose of the FHAP. Receipt of a complaint does not mean thatprocessing will occur. In fact, some received complaints are waived toHUD for HUD processing.  HUD is suspending application of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) in andSection;111.113during the first year of effectiveness of this rule_that is, otherwiseeligible applicants for incentive funds will not have to comply with theseprovisions during the first year of this rule's implementation. This actionis being taken as a transitional move to allow both the Regional Officesand fair housing agencies time to adjust to these new requirements, andto ensure that all Regional Offices apply the same criteria in evaluatingagencies' performance with respect to these provisions.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous  </ITAG>New language in andSection;111.107(a) now states that agencies entering intoagreements with HUD as interim agencies <T3>after </T3>the enactment of the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988are eligible for capacity building funds only. As revised, andSection;111.107(a)now conforms to andSection;115.11, as amended by the final rule implementingthe Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 published on January 23, 1989 (54FR 3232, 3316). Section 115.11 provides, among other things, that ``Inno event shall this period [<T3>i.e., </T3>the period designating an agency as an ``interim agency''for the referral of housing discrimination complaints] extend more thantwo years beyond the date of entry into the agreement for interim referralsor other utilization of services.''  Paragraph (b) of proposed andSection;111.115 has been removed in this finalrule because, in the Department's view, it was too prescriptive.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Other matters  </ITAG>The collection of information requirements contained in this rule havebeen submitted to OMB for review under section 3504(h) of the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and have been assigned OMB Control Number 2529-0005.Sections 111.105, 111.107, 111.111, 111.117, and 111.123 of this rule havebeen determined by the Department to contain collection of informationrequirements.

TheFinding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspection duringregular business hours in the Office of the Rules Docket Clerk, Officeof the General Counsel, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Room10276, 451 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20410. This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), theundersigned hereby certifies that this rule does not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. The rule providesfor the award of Federal funds to State and local government fair housingagencies; it does not impose any economic burdens on small entities.<T3>Executive Order 12606, the Family. </T3>The General Counsel, as theDesignated Official under Executive Order 12606, <T3>the Family, </T3>has determined that this rule will not have potentialsignificant impact on family formation, maintenance, and general well-being,and, therefore, is not subject to review under the Order. The rule implementsa statutory provision that is intended to promote cooperation between theFederal government and State and local fair housing enforcement agenciesin their attempt to eliminate unlawful discriminatory housing practices;any effect on families thus would be a salutary one.<T3>Executive Order 12612, Federalism. </T3>The General Counsel, as theDesignated Official under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, <T3>Federalism, </T3>has determined that this rule will not have substantial,direct effects on States, on their political subdivisions, or on theirrelationship with the Federal government, or on the distribution of powerand responsibilities between them and other levels of government. Thusrule is intended to promote a cooperative effort between the Federal governmentand State and local governments with respect to eliminating discriminationin housing. The Federal government will provide financial assistance, andcooperation is voluntary on the part of State and local governments, butsuch cooperation will not result in diminution of the sovereign powersof cooperating States and their political subdivisions.This rule is listed as Item No. 1007 in the Department's Semiannual Agendaof Regulations published on April 24, 1989 (54 FR 16708, 16738) under ExecutiveOrder 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility Act.The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.401.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 111</ITAG>Fair housing; Cooperative agreements; Grant programs: housing and communitydevelopment.Accordingly, the Department revises 24 CFR Part 111 to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 111_FAIR HOUSING ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.101 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.103 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.105 Funding.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.107 Agency threshold eligibility criteria.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.109 Program administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.111 Application for participation in the FHAP.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.113 Additional agency eligibility criteria for the incentive component.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.115 Eligible activities under the capacity building and incentivecomponents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.117 Standards for annual program review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.119 Uncommitted funds.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.121 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">111.123 Corrective and remedial action.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-20); Sec. 7(d), Departmentof Housing and Urban Development Act (42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 111.101 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>As used in this Part, the following terms have the meaning indicated: ``Agency'' means a State or local fair housing enforcement agency whichis certified (or considered to be certified) as a substantially equivalentagency under 24 CFR Part 115 (including any agency which is a party toan agreement for interim referrals under andSection; 115.11).``Assistant Secretary'' means the Assistant Secretary for Fair Housingand Equal Opportunity.``Capacity building agency'' means an agency that is in its first or secondyear of participation in the FHAP.``Capacity building funds'' are funds that HUD will provide to an agencyduring the agency's first two years of participation in the FHAP to supportdevelopment or enhancement of the agency's fair housing enforcement program,including the agency's complaint processing, training, technical assistance,complaint monitoring and reporting systems, and educational and outreachactivities.``Complaint processing funds'' means funds provided to an agency to supportthe processing of housing discrimination complaints.``Contributions agency'' means an agency that has previously received capacitybuilding awards for two years.``Dual-filed complaint'' means a complaint that has been filed with bothHUD and an agency.``FHAP'' means the Fair Housing Assistance Program.``HUD'' means the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.``Incentive funds'' are funds awarded an agency by HUD based on the populationof the jurisdiction served by the agency.``NOFA'' means Notice of Funding Availability.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 111.103  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose.  </ITAG>The purpose of the Fair Housing Assistance Program (FHAP) is to provideassistance to State and local fair housing enforcement agencies.

Funding levels may be subject to modificationin succeeding fiscal years to reflect variations in annual appropriationsfor the FHAP. Funding levels will be announced by NOFAs published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4>.  (a) <T3>Funding of capacity building agencies. </T3>Capacity building agenciesare eligible to receive capacity building funds only. HUD will give a fixedamount of these funds, during the first two years of an agency's participationin the FHAP, to all capacity building agencies that submit an acceptableapplication. The application must demonstrate, in HUD's determination,that the agency has (or will receive) a sufficient volume of complaintactivity to justify HUD's provision of funds for complaint processing activities.The application must state the objectives and activities to be carriedout by the applicant which must include participation in HUD-sponsoredtraining, complaint monitoring and reporting systems (CMRS), case processing,and any other fair housing activities proposed by the applicant. All activitiesmust address or have ultimate relevance to matters affecting fair housingwhich are cognizable under the Fair Housing Act (42 U.S.C. 3600-20).
