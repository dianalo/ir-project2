To date, 15 paleontology specimenshave been studied using conventional diagnostic units, therapy simulators,and CT scanners. Most specimens, individual marine animals or large dinosaurheads, needed a combination of studies to complete the investigation.Among the results shown are the inner ear of a Plesiosaurus, which is76 million years old, and a pearl attached to an extinct clam species,which is 1 million years old. The results confirm the usefulness of radiologyas a tool in the field of paleontology.</TEXT></DOC>
