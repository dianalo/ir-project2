But this complaint was so unusual that it took Miss Manners awhile to establish that it wasn't about something else -- for example, itsopposite.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  THE SAD WAGES OF SUCCESSGOOD LUCK GETS BAD TREATMENT  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Advice;  Miss Manners is the pseudonym of Washington, D.C.-based writer Judith Martin. Her columns appear Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.  </MEMO><TEXT>     No, the lady was not talking about how people treat failures. Those whosemisfortune is perceived as chronic may be rudely put down by the morefortunate, and those who have reversals of fortune are sometimes callouslydeserted by their former supporters. But neither situation was the topic underdiscussion.;    Nor did this appear to be a complaint about impolite (even ifunderstandable) reactions to success-inspired arrogance or ostentation. As faras Miss Manners could ascertain, the transgressions under discussion wereunprovoked by gloating.;    Nothing to do with envy;  Their victim even deniedthat they could be the result of envy. &quot;I'm talking about the same people whowere always my friends -- even about my relatives,&quot; she said. &quot;I really dothink they're pleased that after all these years, my efforts are beingrecognized and rewarded. These are the people who encouraged me all along. Icouldn't have done it without them. They don't mean to be unkind -- on thecontrary.;    &quot;But it's as though I've forfeited my standing among them bybeing lucky. The kind of consideration they used to show me -- the kind theyexpect from me -- no longer seems to apply.&quot;;    Miss Manners asked forspecifics.;    &quot;Everybody always talks to me about money. When I didn't havemuch, the same people would never have dreamed of speculating about how much-- how little, rather -- I had.;    &quot;But now it comes into everything. Let'ssay a friend complains to me about being tired or overworked. I sympathize andadmit that I'm tired too. 'You?' he'll say. 'Why, you must be laughing all theway to the bank.';    &quot;So I've learned never to mention my work, even wheneveryone else is talking about theirs. But it doesn't help. Sooner or latersomeone will turn to me and ask, 'Still raking it in?';    &quot;Notice the'still.' This not only emphasizes the fact that my success is precarious, butmakes me sound selfish, as if I've been hogging it for too long.;    Goeswithout saying;  &quot;Needless to say, I try not to report my little ups anddowns. If something nice happens, the same people who used to jump up and downwith glee for me are now bored and ask, 'What did you expect?' If I have asetback, instead of commiserating, they say, &quot;So what -- it's not important.'&quot;;    Miss Manners inquired whether things were all right when the subject ofwork didn't come up.;    The lady looked embarrassed. &quot;No -- you see -- well,&quot;she confessed, &quot;my personal life is under control, too. In fact, it's kind ofnice. That's another thing I have to be careful not to mention. If yourchildren turn out well, nobody wants to hear about it.;    &quot;But this isbeginning to sound as if I just want to talk about myself. That's not my pointat all. What I miss is just being considered to share a common humanity.;   &quot;I seem to have been disqualified from showing the interest I always had inother people's triumphs and troubles. If I'm happy for someone else, thatperson will say, 'Of course I know it's nothing in comparison with what youdo,' as if I were trivializing the accomplishment. And if I'm upset forsomeone else, I'll be told, 'You wouldn't understand,' as if I'd never had anyworries and wouldn't know how to cope with them if I had.;    &quot;I'm not askingfor credit because I have my life more or less in order -- I just want to betreated like everyone else again.&quot;;    Miss Manners wished her success.;   DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am vehemently opposed to the wearing of fur, the furindustry, trapping, etc. I have supported groups that share my view, bycontributing funds and long hours of volunteer work.;    Two of mysisters-in-law received fur coats as holiday gifts. We socialize togetherquite a bit, and in all honesty and integrity, I cannot praise their newlyacquired attire. I can't be hypocritical, but I don't want to offend. What canI say to them when we are together?;    GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners so muchadmires your restraint in not wishing to make your principles into anannoyance to others that she is delighted to be able to release you from youretiquette qualms.;    Contrary to popular opinion, it is by no meansobligatory to admire the expensive acquisitions of others. Although occasionalcompliments are pleasant, it strikes Miss Manners that there is altogether toomuch social notice being given to other people's dry goods.;    For you topretend to admire fur coats would be ludicrous. The greatest kindness you cando your sisters-in-law is to say nothing. Should they be so foolish as toprompt you for an opinion, Miss Manners would think you more than justified insaying quietly, &quot;You know I can't approve.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Miss Manners column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2L  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  910  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, January 13, 199100013208,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
