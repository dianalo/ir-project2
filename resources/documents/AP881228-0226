The acquisition of the five savings and loans is the bank group'sfirst venture with thrifts.

The five thrifts involved are First Texas Savings Association andMontfort Federal Savings and Loan Association, both in Dallas;Gibraltar Savings Association and Home Savings and Loan Association,both in Houston; and Killeen Savings and Loan Association, inKilleen.   Ford also is president and chief executive of United New MexicoFinancial Corp.   Since 1975, Ford has acquired several troubled financialinstitutions, instituting stronger management controls.

Perelman,is the majority holder in the deal worked out with Federal Home LoanBank of Dallas.   ``We have the people and the program in place to build thepre-eminent financial institution in the state of Texas,'' saidFord. ``As the regional economy recovers, as we expect it will,First Texas will play a major role in assisting in therevitalization of the communities in which we do business.   ``Our management team has extensive experience in Texas,including a history of successfully managing troubled financialinstitutions,'' said Ford. ``First Texas Bank will be guided byprudent, conservative management principles and strict financialcontrols.''</TEXT></DOC>
