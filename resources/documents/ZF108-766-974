 Thismixture of FDDI and 802 networks will quietly drive the workaday applicationsupon which business and industry rely.andM;For these hybrid FDDI/802 networks to be implemented successfully, LANplanners must understand the key characteristics of the bridging technologythat ties FDDI networks to subnetworks such as 802.3/Ethernet.andP;  If not, theseamless FDDI/802 network interoperability expected by many users may comeapart at the seams.andM;Two Methods, One GoalandM;Two methods are currently being implemented in FDDI-to-802 Ethernet and TokenRing bridges: encapsulation and translation.andP;  In their effort to get productsto market quickly and gain market share, early suppliers of FDDI bridgesimplemented proprietary encapsula on schemes.andP;  Bridge designers assumed thatcustomers, content to use FDDI as a pipeline for 802.3 Ethernet or 802.5token Ring subnetwork traffic, didn't need to attach nodes directly toFDDI--at least not right away.andM;Workstations must connect directly to the FDDI ring for bandwidth-intensiveapplications such as simulation and modeling.andP;  Numerous vendors already sellFDDI controllers that provide this direct connection.andP;  As a result, many MISdepartments must have interoperability between systems attached to FDDInetworks and 802 subnets.andM;Encapsulating bridges simply cannot prorivde this interoperability becausethey use FDDI only as a pipeline between two 802 networks.andP;  Using Ethernet asan example, an encapsulating FDDI bridge places the entire Ethernet packetinside an FDDI packet and forwards the FDDI packet onto the ring (see Figure1).andM;With encapsulation, issues of addressing arise.andP;  Once the Ethernet packet isenveloped inside the FDDI packet, destination address are contained in both.andO;Which destination address does the encapsulating bridge use to forward thepacket?andP;  Because only another encapsulating bridge from the same vendor cande-encapsulate the packet, the bridge must send the packet to another bridge,rather than directly to the Ethernet packet's destination address.andP;  Indelivering the packet, the bridge could broadcast the packet to all bridgeson the internetwork, or it could send the packet to a specific bridge thatknows abot the intended Ethernet destination.andP;  Since broadcasting the packetis an inefficient use of bandwidth, the encapsulating bridge would probablychoose the latter method.andP;  But to understand which of its counterparts knowsabout the intended Ethernet destination, each encapsulating bridge must builda set of address tables matching the FDDI addresses of other encapsulatingbridges with the addresses of various Ethernet end stations (devices such ashosts, file servers, and workstations).andP;  Various proprietary schemes havebeen developed to handle these situations, but no standard for encapsulationexists.andM;Even more important than the destination addressing problem, theencapsulation itself--the act of putting onepacket inside another--severelylimits interoperability in multivendor networks.andP;  For example, a workstationuser on an 802.3/Ethernet LAN could use an encapsulating birdge to access ahigh-performance server on another 802.3/Ethernet, but the encapsulatingbridge would not allow the user to access any servers or hosts directlyattached to the FDDI backbone itself.andP;  Referring to Figure 2, Workstation Acould access Server Z, but could not access Server B, which connects directlyto the FDDI ring.andM;Because FDDI encapsulation has no ANSI, ISO, or other industry standard, allschemes are therefore proprietary.andP;  If encapsulating bridges from differentvendors are used on the backbone, they will not interoperate, and users ontheir associated 82 sub-LANs wil experience a communication blockage.andP;  Anencapsulating bridge cannot send messages through a translating bridge, oreven through an encapsulating bridge from another vendor.andP;  In short,encapsulating bridges elimiate the possibility of multivendorinteroperability, an attribute that MIS departments require for effectivesystems integration.andM;Translating bridges, on the other hand, assure multivendor interoperabilityby translating data packets from one data link protocol to another.andP;  Aproprietary algorithm need not match an 802.3/Ethernet destination addresswith a specific bridge's destination address.andP;  The translations performedcomply with IEEE 802 standards.andP;  Ethernet version 2.0 packets are translatedto FDDI SNAP-SAP (Sub Net Access Protocol-Service Access Point) and viceversa.andP;  IEEE 802.2 DSAP-SSAP (Destination SAP-Source SAP) packets aretranslated to FDDI 802.2 LLC (Logical Link Control) packets and vice versa(see Figure 3).andM;Workstations on an 802.3/Ethernet can access high-performance serversdirectly attached to FDDI networks because the 802.3/Ethernet packets aretranslated into FDDI packets, not merely packaged into them.andP;  For example, inFigure 4, Workstation A can access both Server Z on another 802.3/Ethernetand Server B on FDDI, even if the bridges are from different vendors.andM;Vendors embraced encapsulating bridges because they are easier to build thantranslating bridges, and they solve the immediate need to use FDDI as apipeline.andP;  But they do not provide complete interoperability between FDDI and802 end stations, and they lock LAN planners into a single-vendorenvironment.andP;  Translating bridges are more difficult to design and build thanencapsulating bridges because keeping up with the bridge's forwarding raterequires real-time data translation.andP;  But the payback for the enduser--complete multivendor interoperability--is well justified.andP;  Notsurprisingly, translating bridges are emerging as the standard fornext-generation FDDI bridges.andM;Packet FragmentationandM;Connecting 802 LANs to FDDI networks requires the resolution of thedifferences in maximum packet sizes.andP;  FDDI supports a maximum packet size of4,500 bytes, while 802 subnetworks such as 802.3/Ethernet allows packet sizesof no more than 1,518 bytes.andP;  What happens whens when a bridge needs toforward a 4,500-byte FDDI packet to an 802.3/Ethernet subnet?andM;When using a communications protocol such as TCP/IP, the IP RFC 791 defines amethod for handling such packet size differences.andP;  This method, known aspacket fragmentation, breaks up large packets into smaller packets so theymay be forwarded successfully onto subnetworks.andP;  An FDDI bridge thatimplements RFC 791 breaks up a 4,500-byte packet into multiple packets, eachof a valid 802.3/Ethernet size, and forwards them onto the 802.3/Ethernetnetwork.andP;  The TCP/IP end station reasembles the fragmented packet accordingto the RFC 791 standard.andP;  By following the RFC, the packets are assembled incorrect order, all transparently to the end station application.andM;IP fragmentation is accmoplished through the use of several key fields in theIP header.andP;  Two such fields are the flags, MORE FRAG or DONT FRAG, whichindicate one of three conditions: whether the packet is not fragmented,whether it is fragmented, or whether fragmentation is not allowed.andP;  The thirdfield, FRAGMENT OFFSET, indicates where the fragment fits relative to thebeginning of the original packet (see Figure 5).andM;Mre explicitly, a &quot;1&quot; in the DONT FRAG field means that the packet is not tobe fragmented.andP;  If the packet is under the 1,518-byte limit, it will beforwarded to 802.3/Ethernet, but if it is larger than 1,518 bytes, it willsimply be discarded.andP;  A &quot;0&quot; in all fields indicates that the packet is notfragmented, and no fragmented packets will follow.andP;  A &quot;1&quot; in the MORE FRAGfield and a &quot;0&quot; in the FRAGMENT OFFSET field denotes that the packet has beenfragmented, and it is the first one.andP;  A &quot;1&quot; in the MORE FRAG field and avalue in the FRAGMENT OFFSET field signifies that the packet is a fragmentand more follow.andP;  And a &quot;0&quot; in the MORE FRAG field with a value in theFRAGMENT OFFSET field shows that the packet is a fragment, and it is the lastone in line.andM;Packet fragmentation is important for applications and protocols that uselarge packet sizes.andP;  Fragmentation is actually a routing function, but if anFDDI bridge does not support fragmentation, certain applications simply willnot work over the bridge interconnection.andP;  File transfer is an elementary butillustrative example of such an application.andP;  Another example, Sun's NetworkFile System (NFS) which uses the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), uses largepacket sizes to allow users to mount remote disks.andM;Like address translation, fragmentation must be done in real-time so it willnot degrade the performance of the bridge.andP;  Fragmentation allows applicationsto take advantage of maximum-sized packets on both LANs, which results in amore efficient use of both FDDI and 802.3/Ethernet bannwidth.andM;Bridge PerformanceandM;One of the most important characteristics of an FDDI bridge is its ability tofilter and forward packets at high speeds.andP;  For an FDDI bridge to meet thegoals of transparent bridging as outlined by the IEEE 802.1 committee, itmust capably handle burst load traffic on either LAN without missing criticalspanning tree hello packets.andP;  Hello packets are key management packetsnecessary for maintaining network integrity via the spanning-tree algorithm.andO;Under worst-case loads, if a bridge misses hellow packets, it can lead to anunstable spanning tree.andM;Transparent bridges that can handle high loads are desirable because theygive the network end station the appearance of a single transparent LAN, eventhough many sub-LANs of different data-link rates make it up.andM;The performance of an FDDI bridge is measured by its ability to perform tablelook-ups for filtering and forwarding decisions, translate one data-linkformat to another, fragment large packets, and execute the 802.1dspanning-tree algorithm.andM;FDDI-to Ethernet bridges should be able to forward data from FDDI to802.3/Ethernet networks at the full Ethernet rate in a worst-case condition,which, at a minimum packet size of 64 bytes, is 14,880 packets per second(pps).andP;  To make these forwarding decisions, these bridges must also examineevery packet on the FDDI and 802.3/Ethernet sides; therefore, they mustfilter FDDI and 802.3/Ethernet packets at least as quickly as any LAN burstrate that might occur.andP;  Since 20 bytes is the minimum length for validFDDILLC packets with 48-bit addresses, the worst-case sceneario for FDDI is asustained burst of 20 byte packets with a maximum arrival rate of 100Mbps, or446,429 pps.andP;  And since 64 bytes is the minimum length for valid802.3/Ethernet packets, the worst case demands a filler rate of 14,880 pps.andO;Combining the two figures results in a requirement for an aggregate filteringrate of 461,309 pps.andM;These numbers represent the optimal capabilities of a standards-compliant,translating, transparent FDDI/802 bridge.andP;  Anything less fails to exploit thefull advantages of FDDI's communications speed.andM;The Age-Old DebateandM;Although the distinctions between routers and bridges have blurred, severalimportant differences between the two internetworking devices remain.andP;  Thesedifferences can benefit network users and administrators.andM;Currently, bridges outperform routers in LAN-to-LAN interconnections, butrouters can provide an additional autonomy desirable in some networks.andP;  Forexample, an engineering group may require unconstrained access to an FDDIserver via a bridge, whereas a finance group may value the control andautonomy offered by a router more highly than the performance benefitsoffered by a bridge.andM;Bridges offer complete protocol independence, while multiprotocol routersrequire an addtional module for each protocol.andP;  In effect, multiprotocolrouters are multiple routers in the same box.andP;  In the current generation ofrouters, each additional protocol supported typically has an impact onperformance, whereas bridge performance remains unaffected by the number ofprotocols handled.andM;Routers, which currently have no standard for routing control messages,require that customers use pairs of routers from the same vendor over leasedlines, or create an FDDI backbone connection using routers from the samevendor.andP;  Since bridges conforming to the IEEE 802.1d standard use a universallanguage to control configuration, they are vendor-independent as well asprotocol-independent.andM;Moreover, FDDI bridges are no longer pure bridges.andP;  Many incorporate featuresof the router forwarding process and are thus considered hybrids.andP;  This trendtoward hybrid technology will only continue.andP;  Packet fragmentation waspreviously found only in routers as a part of the router forwarding process.andM;Hybrids have also implemented the ability to filter certain packets to solvesecurity or congestion problems on the extended LAN.andP;  Source addressfiltering allows network managers to restrict user access to the extendedLAN, while protocol filtering provides the ability to block access of certainprotocol types.andP;  Both of these filters are common features now incorporatedin hybrid bridges and can help contain such problems as broadcast storms inlarge LAN environments.andM;Which Route?andM;Two algorithms are used for LAN-to-LAN bridging.andP;  The Ethernet communitytraditionally endorses transparent bridging, while IBM has put its weightbehind source routing.andP;  Recent changes proposed by joint meetings of the IEEE802.1 bridging and 802.5 Token Ring committees provides clues to the outcomeof the battle.andM;In 1986, the IEEE 802.1 committee selected transparent bridging as the basisfor a universal bridge architecture for 802 LANs.andP;  At the same time, thecommittee rejected source routing, restricting its use exclusively to 802.5Token Ring networks.andP;  In addition, the 802.5 committee began to struggle withthe requirements for interoperability with 802.1 bridges.andP;  After a longdebate, the committee rejected a proposal for a bridge that placedrestrictions on the end stations and network topologies supported.andM;At its March 1990 meeting in Irvine, Calif., the IEEE 802.5 committeeaccepted a proposal to completely rewrite the source routing draft to make itinteroperate with the IEEE 802.1d transparent bridging standard.andP;  In fact,the entire source routing specification will be rewritten to require thatsource routing may only be done as an additional function in a bridge thatalready does transparent bridging.andP;  In other words, source routing-onlybridges will no longer be allowed.andM;The joint 802.1/802.5 committee strongly supported the creation ofsource-routing/transparent (SRT) bridges and SRT stations that default totransparent bridging but can also perform source routing.andP;  The result is thatsource routing will continue to receive support in 802.5 environments, butonly as an option.andM;These decisions acknowledge that transparent bridging has become the bridgingstandard of choice.andP;  Because the source routing standard is in the midst of amajor revamping, source routing as it exists today must be considered aproprietary bridging algorithm.andP;  Transparent bridging, the IEEE 802.1dstandard, has emerged as the true multivendor network solution, and thecurrent LAN-bridge market bears this out.andP;  In addition, multiple vendors havealready announced FDDI bridging products based on the 802.1d standard.andP;  Thejoint 802.1/802.5 committee's current work on SRT bridges and SRT endstations will make it easier in the future to integrate 802.5 and 802.3networks via FDDI.andM;Network ManagementandM;A high level of confusion exists in the marketplace about the role of theStation Management (SMT) portion of the FDDI standard.andP;  SMT is a low-level,limited-function protocol for the management of specific portions of the FDDIproduct set.andP;  SMT manages the Physical Media Dependent (PMD), Physical(PHY),and Media Access Control (MAC) layers of FDDI.andP;  It typically resides infirmware (see Figure 6).andM;SMT is limited to use on a single FDDI ring.andP;  It cannot be used across a widearea network or across multiple FDDI rings, nor canit manage functionsoutside of FDDI.andP;  On the other hand, higher-level protocols, such as simpleNetwork Management Protocol (SNMP) or the protocols of system managementproducts such as Digital's DNA, can communicate across multiple rings oracross an entire wide area network.andM;SMT manages only the FDDI components within a node.andP;  Higher-level networkmanagement protocols can manage every aspect of the node.andP;  So it is unlikelythat many network management applications will be developed to use the SMTprotocol or control frames directly.andP;  It is more likely that applicationswill be developed using protocols like SNMP, which is the emerging de factostandard for network management.andP;  SNMP is not limited to use within FDDI; itcan manage Ethernet bridges or routers, wide area routers, or systems.andP;  SMT,on the other hand, is limited to use on FDDI only.andM;The ANSI committee for FDDI has agreed that all future versions will bebackward-compatible with version 5.1 of SMT.andP;  SMT version 5.1 is therefore acompatibility starting point for FDDI products coming out now, but LANplanners should be concerned about vendors' strategies for migrating tofuture versions of SMT once those versions receive approval.andM;Building for TomorrowandM;FDDI promises the benefits of high-speed, vendor-independent, standards-basednetworking.andP;  However, like other industry standards, including the SCSI busand the Unix operating system, the ANSI FDDI standard contains sufficientroom for network vendors to maneuver.andM;Many initial FDDI installations will employ the new technology as a backboneto interconnect existing mid-speed LANs.andP;  Others will construct networks ofFDDI only.andP;  But until today's information systems architects come to termswith FDDI bridging technology, their vision of fully interoperable networkedsystems from multiple vendors will never achieve realization.andM;Paul Callahan is the FDDI marketing manager for Digital Equipment Corp'sTelecommunications andamp;
