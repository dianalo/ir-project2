This notice of determination is issued in accordance with the AgriculturalAdjustment Act of 1938, as amended (the ``1938 Act''), and the AgriculturalAct of 1949, as amended (the ``1949 Act''), in order to announce for the1989 marketing year for flue-cured tobacco the following: 1. The amount of domestic manufacturers' intentions; 2. The amount of the average exports for the 1986, 1987, and 1988 cropyears; 3. The amount of the reserve stock level; 4. The amount of adjustment needed to maintain loan stocks at the reservestock level; 5. The amount of the national marketing quota; 6. The national average yield goal; 7.

The Deficit Reduction Assessment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The determinations set forth in this notice have been made on thebasis of the latest available statistics of the Federal Government.Since the 1988-89 marketing year is the last of the three consecutive yearsfor which marketing quotas previously proclaimed on an acreage-poundagebasis will be in effect, section 317(d) of the 1938 Act provides that theSecretary shall proclaim marketing quotas for flue-cured tobacco on eitheran acreage basis or an acreage-poundage basis for the 1989-90, 1990-91,and 1991-92 marketing years, whichever the Secretary determines would resultin a more effective quota. It has been determined that, in view of thebetter supply control resulting from the acreage-poundage quota programbeginning in 1965, a more effective quota would result by continuing marketingquotas on an acreage-poundage basis. <ITAG tagnum="84">Marketing Quotas </ITAG>Section 317(a)(1) of the 1938 Act provides, in part, that the nationalmarketing quota for a marketing year for flue-cured tobacco is the quantityof such tobacco that is not more than 103 percent nor less than 97 percentof the total of: (1) The amount of flue-cured tobacco that domestic manufacturersof cigarettes estimate they intend to purchase on U.S. auction marketsor from producers, (2) the average quantity exported annually from theU.S. during the three marketing years immediately preceding the marketingyear for which the determination is being made and (3) the quantity, ifany, necessary to adjust loan stocks to the reserve stock level. Section317(a)(1)(C) further provides that, with respect to the 1986 through 1989marketing years, any reduction in the national marketing quota being determinedshall not exceed six percent of the previous years national marketing quota.The  ``reserve stock level'' is defined in section 301(b)(14)(C) of the1938 Act as the greater of 100 million pounds or 15 percent of the nationalmarketing quota for flue-cured tobacco for the marketing year immediatelypreceding the marketing year for which the level is being determined. Section 320A of the 1938 Act provides that all domestic manufacturers ofcigarettes with more than 1 percent of U.S. cigarette production and salesshall submit to the Secretary a statement of purchase intentions for the1989 crop of flue-cured tobacco by December 1, 1988. Six such manufacturerswere required to submit such a statement for the 1989 crop and the totalof their intended purchases for the 1989 crop was 543.6 million pounds.The three-year average of exports is 388.1 million pounds. This is basedon Census-reported exports of 393.3 million pounds for 1986 and 385.3 millionpounds for 1987, and USDA-projected exports of 385.6 million pounds for1988. In accordance with section 301(b)(14)(C) of the 1938 Act, the reserve stocklevel is the greater of 100 million pounds or 15 percent of the 1988 marketingquota for flue-cured tobacco. The national marketing quota for the 1988crop year was 755 million pounds (53 FR 16175). Accordingly, the reservestock level for use in determining the 1989 marketing quota for flue-curedtobacco is 113.2 million pounds.  As of December 2, the Flue-Cured Tobacco Stabilization Corporation hadin its inventory 126.9 million pounds of flue-cured tobacco (excludingpre-1985 stocks committed to be purchased by manufacturers and coveredby deferred sales). Accordingly, the adjustment to maintain loan stocksat the reserve supply level is a decrease of 13.7 million pounds. The total of the three marketing quota components for the 1989-90 marketingyear is 918 million pounds. Section 317 of the 1938 Act further providesthat the Secretary may increase or decrease the total by 3 percent. Toensure against the development of an oversupply situation, the Secretaryexercised this discretionary authority to decrease the three-componenttotal by three percent. Accordingly, the national marketing quota for themarketing year beginning July 1, 1989 for flue-cured tobacco is 890.5 millionpounds. Section 317(a) of the 1938 Act provides that the national average yieldgoal be set at a level, which on a national average basis, the Secretarydetermines will improve or insure the usability of the tobacco and increasethe net return per pound to the growers. In making such determination,the Secretary is to give consideration to such Federal-State productionresearch data as is deemed relevant. In determining such goal, the extensionservice tobacco specialists in major tobacco producing States were contacted.These individuals generally agreed the national average yield goal shouldbe increased to reflect increased productivity. Accordingly, it has beendetermined that the national average yield goal for the 1989-90 marketingyear will be 2,088 pounds per acre, up 5 percent from last year.In accordance with section 317(a)(3) of the 1938 Act, the nationa1 acreageallotment for the 1989 crop of flue-cured tobacco is determined to be 426,484.67acres, which is the result of dividing the national marketing quota bythe new national average yield goal. In accordance with section 317(e) of the 1938 Act, the Secretary is authorizedto establish a national reserve from the national acreage allotment inan amount equivalent to not more than 3 percent of the national acreageallotment for the purpose of making corrections in farm acreage allotments,adjusting for inequities, and for establishing allotments for new farms.The Secretary has determined that a national reserve for the 1989 cropof flue-cured tobacco of 717 acres is adequate for these purposes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Price Support </ITAG>Price suport is required to be made available for each crop of a kind oftobacco for which quotas are in effect, or for which marketing quotas havenot been disapproved by producers, at a level which is determined in accordancewith a formula prescribed in section 106 of the 1949 Act. With respect to the 1989 crop of flue-cured tobacco, the level of supportis determined in accordance with sections 106 (d) and (f) of the 1949 Act.Section 106(f)(4) of the 1949 Act provides that the level of support forthe 1989 crop of flue-cured tobacco shall be: (1) The level in cents perpound at which the 1988 crop of flue-cured tobacco was supported plus orminus respectively, (2) an adjustment of not less  than 65 percent normore than 100 percent of the total, as determined by the Secretary aftertaking into consideration the supply of the kind of tobacco involved inrelation to demand, of: (A) 66.7 percent of the amount by which: (I) The average price receivedby producers for flue-cured tobacco on the United States auction markets,as determined by the Secretary, during the 5 marketing years immediatelypreceding the marketing year for which the determination is being made,excluding the year in which the average price was the highest and the yearin which the average price was the lowest in such period, is greater orless than (II) The average price received by producers for flue-cured tobacco onthe United States auction markets, as determined by the Secretary, duringthe 5 marketing years immediately preceding the marketing year prior tothe marketing year for which the determination is being made, excludingthe year in which the average price was the highest and the year in whichthe average price was the lowest in such period; and (B) 33.3 percent of the change, expressed as a cost per pound of tobacco,in the index of prices paid by tobacco producers from January 1 to December31 of the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the determinationis made.  For the purpose of calculating the market-price component of the supportlevel, the 1949 Act provides that the average market price be reduced 25cents per pound for the 1985 marketing year and 30 cents per pound forprior marketing years. The difference between the two 5-year averages (the difference between(A)(I) and (A)(II)) is 3.6 cents per pound. The difference in the costindex from January 1 to December 31, 1988 is 4.7 cents per pound. Applyingthese components to the price support formula (3.6 cents per pound, two-thirdsweight; 4.7 cents per pound, one-third weight) result in an increase inthe price support level of 4.0 cents per pound. However, section 106 furtherprovides that the Secretary may limit the change in the price support levelto no less than 65 percent of the change that otherwise would have occurredif an oversupply exists for such kind of tobacco. Because the total supplyof flue-cured tobacco is sufficient for about 2.5 years use, with 2.4 yearsbeing considered normal, the Secretary has determined that supplies offlue-cured tobacco are excessive. Accordingly, the 1989 crop of flue-curedtobacco will be supported at 146.8 cents per pound, 2.6 cents higher thanin 1988. The level of support for the 1989 crop of flue-cured tobacco and the nationalmarketing quota for the 1989 flue-cured marketing year were announced onDecember 15, 1988 by the Secretary of Agriculture. This notice affirmsthese determinations. Accordingly, the following determinations have been made for flue-curedtobacco for the marketing year beginning July 1, 1989: <ITAG tagnum="84">Proclamation of National Marketing Quotas </ITAG>Since the 1988-89 marketing year in the last of three consecutive marketingyears for which marketing quotas previously proclaimed will be in effectfor flue-cured tobacco, a national marketing quota for such kind of tobaccofor each of the three marketing years beginning July 1, 1989, July 1, 1990,and July 1, 1991 is hereby proclaimed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Determinations 1989-90 Marketing Year </ITAG>(a) Marketing quotas shall be in effect for the 1989-90 marketing yearfor flue-cured tobacco.
