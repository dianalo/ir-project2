As black, greasy rain threatened crops and unnervedcivilians in Iran and Turkey yesterday, scientists withBritain's Meterological Office said smoke from nearly 600oil-well fires in Kuwait will blanket much of the Gulfregion, and some parts of Asia, with health-threatening smog.</LP><TEXT>   The scientists also said the smoke -- from the projectedburning of about 80 million tons of oil over the next 12months -- is likely to cast a sunlight-robbing pall thatcould reduce surface temperatures in some regions downwind ofKuwait by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit. Those regions,for as long as the fires burn, are likely to be subjected toacid-rain levels comparable &quot;to those you would find aroundany major industrialized area,&quot; said a spokeswoman for theMeterological Office.   The British scientists, however, said serious, long-termclimatic effects from the smoke will be minimal. They calledmajor damage to the atmospheric ozone layer &quot;unlikely&quot; anddownplayed the prospect that the huge amount of pollutionpumped into the stratosphere might seriously affect monsoonrains critical to Asian regions. They also said the impact ofcarbon dioxide emissions on global warming will be &quot;almostnegligible.&quot;   The fires are thought to have been deliberately set by theIraqi army as part of its &quot;scorched-earth&quot; campaign prior toits retreat from Kuwait. U.S. experts have estimated it couldtake up to two years to snuff them all out. Gulfair-pollution problems have also been exacerbated by the longbombing campaign by allied military forces that has set fireto refineries, chemical complexes and other industrialinstallations.   Some effects of the oil-well fires are already apparent.Smoke-darkened skies were reported as far south as Qataryesterday. Kuwait City and Baghdad have been swathed in asmoggy haze for days, while Turkish authorities 600 milesnorth of Kuwait were deluged by queries from nervous citizensbeing pelted with black, greasy rain. And in western Iran, asimilar rain and billowing smoke clouds stretched for 900miles.</TEXT></DOC>
