About 20 whaling officials and Parliament members greeted theNisshin Maru No. 3's 120 crew members at a ceremony on its longmain deck.   ``Your whaling is crucial for maintaining Japan's foodculture,'' Tatsuo Shinmori, a Parliament member, told the crew.``You struggled against the protesters, and now we should followyour example by doing our best to protect whaling.''   Stored beneath the ship's 23,000-ton deck was the meat from 241Minke whales, already processed by a shipboard factory. Scientistsestimate stocks of Minke whales at between 400,000 and 700,000.   In the early 1960s, whales provided 23 percent of all meatconsumed in Japan. But declining supplies have turned it into adelicacy, and the Nisshin Maru, with its rusty, paint-marked sides,is the only remaining mother ship.   Japan, still the world's largest consumer of whale meat,officially stopped whaling commercially in 1987, following aworldwide ban by the International Whaling Commission.   But the ban allows so-called research whaling, under whichcountries can capture whales to test stocks, then may consume themeat. The research is to see whether there are sufficient stocks ofsome species to allow limited commercial whaling when the ban isre-evaluated in 1990.   International environmental groups such as Greenpeace havecharged that Japan is using the research provision as a ploy tocontinue whaling, and that alternative non-lethal research methodsare available.   Greenpeace members used a ship and rubber rafts to try to blockthe Nisshin Maru and its three catcher boats from whaling in theAntarctic waters, and collided once with the mother ship.   ``There's a basic difference between us in ideology andphilosophy _ they want to protect all whales _ so a conflict isinevitable,'' said Hidehiro Kato, director of research on theNisshin Maru.   ``I'd prefer to use non-lethal methods, but they don't tell usage, reproductive status or condition of the whales,'' he said.``At this point, the best approach is a combination of lethal andnon-lethal research.''   Japanese whaling officials initially said at least 825 whaleshad to be caught each season to make the research programscientifically accurate. But following strong internationalopposition, they reduced this year's goal to 300.   Kato said the fleet did not reach the goal primarily because ofbad weather, but that the Greenpeace protests ``had some effect.''   Crew member Hideyoshi Yoshida said he was in a catcher boat thatnarrowly missed being hit by the Greenpeace ship.   ``The research whaling was approved by the Japanese government,so I wish people opposed to it would discuss it with thegovernment, rather than confronting us while we're whaling,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
