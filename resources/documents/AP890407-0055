BIGELOW</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former first lady Nancy Reagan's anti-drugcrusade took her to a late-night police raid on a suspected cocaine``rock house,'' an experience she found ``very depressing.''   ``I was able to see them busting in,'' said Mrs. Reagan, whowore a blue police windbreaker and running shoes to the Thursdaynight raid. ``I always see the other end, kids who are inrehabilitation.''   Police Chief Daryl Gates, who brought Mrs. Reagan to the raid,said she had expressed an interest previously in going on a drugbust but was unable to do so as first lady because of securityconcerns.   The raid took place in the city's beleaguered south centralsection, where gangs such as the Crips and Bloods wage war on eachother, often using semiautomatic weapons such as the AK-47 to carryout their vendettas.   Police arrested 14 people and seized a small quantity of whatthey believed to be crystalline rock cocaine as Mrs. Reaganwatched. Earlier in the evening, police said she witnessedundercover officers making drug purchases.   ``It's awful to see when you think that these people have nolives. It's very sad,'' she said, remarking on the arrests and thehouse's sparse furnishings.   Gates said the house was called a ``rock house'' and a ``smokehouse'' because drug users would use it as a location for smokingcocaine. The name is derived from the crystalline ``rocks'' ofcocaine peddled and from the fortifications which are ofteninstalled in such homes by drug dealers.   ``We gave her the opportunity to see what the dope trade isabout,'' Gates said. ``She was right there when the SWAT team wentin.''   She did not talk to any of those arrested, but one of them said,``Hello Mrs. Reagan.''   ``Now, it's too late for them,'' she said. ``What a waste. Whatwasted lives.''   Mrs. Reagan, 65, who made the war against drugs a cornerstone ofReagan administration policy, has continued her anti-drugactivities since she returned to the West Coast with formerPresident Reagan.   One bystander, Elliott Davis, 21, said his sister was amongthose arrested.   ``If it's going to help, I think it's good,'' he said of theraid and Mrs. Reagan's involvement. ``I hope she talks to thepeople who are using, because I think she'd be an inspiration.''   A crowd of about 50 people gathered after the raid. Some amongthem started calling out: ``Nancy, Nancy Reagan.'' A few madegestures associated with street gang membership, but most were wellbehaved.   Commenting on security procedures employed for the raid, Gatesquipped, ``I'm sure the Secret Service agents have aged about tenyears.''   Mrs. Reagan interjected, ``Along with my husband,'' who was homein Bel-Air.   A drug rehabilitation center that will bear the name of theformer first lady is planned in the San Fernando Valley communityof Lake View Terrace about 25 miles northwest of downtown.</TEXT></DOC>
