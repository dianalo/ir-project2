(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Convicted PTL aides David and JamesTaggart will be sent to a minimum-security prison in Alabama thatonce housed Watergate conspirators Charles Colson and former U.S.Attorney General John Mitchell, the brothers' attorney says.   The Taggarts, sentenced on tax evasion charges last month, willbe sent to the prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery,Ala., attorney Ben Cotten said Wednesday.   The three-acre prison camp has no fences and features cabletelevision, a fishing pond and handball courts.   In 1987, the men's magazine M voted it the fifth best among``Club Feds'' _ minimum-security federal prisons the magazine saidwere the best places to serve time, if one must.   Inmates usually have 10 days to report to federal prison onceassigned a location. Cotten said the Taggarts haven't been assigneda date to report yet.   The Taggarts were convicted in July of using more than $1.1million in PTL money to pay personal bills and not reporting thatmoney as income.   On Sept. 8, U.S. District Judge Robert Potter gave DavidTaggart, former personal aide to Jim Bakker, the maximum sentenceof 18 years and five months.   He gave James Taggart, PTL's former interior decorator, 17 yearsand nine months. Potter also fined the two Charlotte men $500,000each and ordered them to pay at least $525,000 in income taxes.   Cotten said he plans to file a motion in the next week or twoseeking to reduce the Taggarts' sentences because of theirassistance in Jim Bakker's trial, which went to a jury this week.</TEXT></DOC>
