During the work,the method appeared to function well in controlling worker exposuresto asbestos fibers. It is recommended that workers use respiratory protectionon any glove-bag work due to possible leakage. During removal operations,asbestos fiber concentrations rose from a preremoval level of 0.002 fibersper cubic centimeter (f/cc) to 0.020f/cc during preparation of pipe laggingfor removal and to 0.289f/cc during actual removal in glove bags. Theseworkers had limited experience with the glove-bag technique; the authorssuggest that this is common for individuals required to use the method.The authors conclude that a secondary containment system should be usedas an adjunct to the glove-bag treatment, such as negative air barriers.</TEXT></DOC>
