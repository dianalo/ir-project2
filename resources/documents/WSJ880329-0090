The publishing activities of Pearson, which claims to be the world's fifth-largest English-language book publisher, were buoyed by the Financial Times newspaper and big U.S. sales of &quot;Spycatcher,&quot; the banned-in-Britain memoirs of a U.K. secret agent.    Overall pretax profit rose to an indicated #100.6 million ($184.5 million) in last year's second half from #77 million a year earlier. Earnings before extraordinary items advanced 35% to #66.3 million from #49.2 million, as sales increased 6.8% to #531.5 million from #497.6 million.    Mr. Murdoch, who has acquired just over 20% of Pearson's shares in recent months through his Australia-based News Corp., is viewed by Pearson as a potential predator, despite his disavowals and public statements seeking cooperation. &quot;Our dialogue is fairly limited,&quot; Pearson Chairman Lord Blakenham said yesterday.    Pearson executives said Mr. Murdoch hasn't made any &quot;serious proposal&quot; to build U.S. circulation of the Financial Times, something Mr. Murdoch has mentioned in interviews lately.    Pearson always was &quot;a very difficult company to take over&quot; because of U.K. politics and substantial family holdings, said Derek Terrington, an analyst at London stockbrokers Phillips andamp; Drew. &quot;Now, they're becoming more difficult on (profit) grounds. That was always the weakest link in the chain.&quot;    Pearson's holdings include oil properties, interests in the Lazard investment banks, Royal Doulton china and Madame Tussaud's Wax Museum in London. But publishing grew to 60% of sales last year, compared with 37% in 1982. Books represent Pearson's largest business, following its $283 million acquisition of Boston-based Addison-Wesley Publishing Co. this year.    The London-based Financial Times, reflecting gains in efficiency and circulation, increased pretax profit sevenfold between 1982 and 1987. The Financial Times's move to a new and larger U.K. printing plant this year will cut annual labor costs by about #12 million, a Pearson official said. Its advertising so far this year is above year-earlier levels, despite last fall's stock-market crash, Pearson reported.    Pearson shares were quoted at 675 pence, up from 660 pence Friday, on London's stock exchange late yesterday.    For all of 1987, Pearson said pretax profit rose 25% to #151.8 million from #121.1 million a year earlier. Net income soared nearly fourfold to #239.3 million, after extraordinary gains of #141.4 million, up from #64.4 million in 1986, after an extraordinary loss of #9.1 million.    The 1987 extraordinary gain largely reflected a #128 million gain on the sale of the Financial Times's London headquarters. Sales last year fell slightly to #952.2 million from #952.6 million in 1986, resulting from disposals. </TEXT></DOC>
