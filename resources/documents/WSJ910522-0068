The need for currency futures and options with no U.S.dollar component has grown as the dollar has lost its statusas the world's sole benchmark currency. The Merc set nextWednesday as its launch date for three cross-rate futures andthree options -- one each in marks against yen, marks againstpounds and marks against Swiss francs.</LP><TEXT>   Two other exchanges, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange andthe fledgling Twin Cities Board of Trade, also plancross-rate contracts.   The Philadelphia exchange, pending approval by theSecurities and Exchange Commission, plans an early Junelaunch of three contracts -- a markyen option, a mark-poundoption and a pound-yen option. The Philadelphia contractswill be settled in foreign currencies, but the Merc contractswill be settled in U.S. dollars.   The Twin Cities exchange said it hopes to launch apound-mark futures contract in August.</TEXT></DOC>
