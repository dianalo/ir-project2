SEWARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Communist Party opened an ideologyconference Thursday aimed at charting a new course following aCentral Committee offer to allow the opposition to organize andparticipate in running the country.   Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the leader of the nation and the party,delivered the opening address to 469 party members and hundreds ofobservers from other East bloc countries gathered in Warsaw.   ``Poland is living through a time of great transformations. Theyare being born among various contradictions, in the course ofdiscussions and disputes in the increasingly broad socialistdialogue,'' Jaruzelski said.   ``Hence our expectation the conference will answer questionsabout the current shape of values and principles of socialism, theirpresence in political and economic transformations, the essence ofpluralism, and directions of further chances in the party itself,''he said.   Issues of ownership, the political system itself and changes inthe party are among the main topics at the meeting, said AndrzejCzyz, head of the party's ideological department, in an interviewwith the news agency PAP.   The party convened the conference at a time when there is opencriticism among its members over a Central Committee offer made at aparty plenum Jan. 18 to negotiate the legalization of the bannedtrade union Solidarity.   The party-sanctioned martial law crackdown in December 1981crushed the Soviet bloc's only independent trade union andparliament formally banned the union about a year later.   At the plenum, 20 percent of the Central Commitee members opposedtrade union pluralism, Politburo member Jozef Czyrek told the weeklynewspaper Polityka.   The future of the union as well as political and economic reformswill be discussed when party officials, government representativesand members of the opposition open talks Feb. 6.   ``Agreement combined with opening to broadly perceived pluralismwill not be easy and will also be a struggle,'' Jaruzelski said.``But we want this process to be marked by political culture, mutualrespect which overcomes confrontational stereotypes, rancour andresentment.''   Politburo member Marian Orzechowski, designated to prepare theideological conference, said Monday the conference ``is merelyconcerned with ideology and theory. It cannot take any personnelchanges. It cannot take any other binding conclusions.''   Orzechowski said that the party has more than 2 million membersand that less than 100 members had handed in their party cards afterthe decision on Soldiarity.   Czyz said the Polish party had been following changes in othersocialist countries and that party scientists and theoreticians hadmet with their counterparts from the Soviet Union and Hungary beforethe conference.   The closed-door sessions of the conference will continue untilSaturday.</TEXT></DOC>
