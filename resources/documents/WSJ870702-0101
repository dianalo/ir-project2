Judge Bork's writings and opinions make him today's closest link to the Founders. So before liberal senators tangle with him, they might want to read the Constitution's Article II, Section 2. This says that it is the president who &quot;shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . . Judges of the supreme Court.&quot;    The Constitution says nothing about the president's power to select a justice depending on whether the court retains &quot;ideological balance.&quot; The Constitution doesn't say senators can pick the nominee or that they can fulfill the advice and consent duty by delaying and filibustering. Of course, the liberals may respond that the text represents mere &quot;original intent.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
