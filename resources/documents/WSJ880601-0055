Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FIN </IN><DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   For many students, the trouble with law school isn't professorial terrorism of the kind practiced by actor John Houseman in &quot;The Paper Chase.&quot; Instead, it's three solid years of parsing mostly abstract appellate court opinions. It leaves them bored and restless.    After a few semesters, most students &quot;are tapping their feet and waiting until they can go out into the real world and start making real money,&quot; says Robert Gordon, a legal historian and Stanford University law professor.    But in Boston one small law school has attacked student ennui with a 19th century idea: learning the profession by apprenticeship. After a year of introductory classes, the 480 students at Northeastern University's School of Law split the remaining two years, including summers, between school work and supervised law office assignments in its Cooperative Education Program.    Co-op differs considerably from the summer internships which many law students find on their own. As a mandatory part of Northeastern's course-work, it calls for students to go through four separate, three-month stints, typically with public agencies and firms practicing varied types of law. After each stint, the employer writes an evaluation of the student that then becomes part of the student's school record. Furthermore, students gain the kind of hands-on experience professors regularly call upon in class to illustrate problems in the actual practice of law.    Co-op is not the only thing that separates Northeastern from other law schools. Northeastern's professors go by their first names in class. They give written evaluations instead of grades. And their students, about 57% of whom are women, don't sweat over qualifying for the law review staff -- there isn't one.    But co-op is the most visible difference -- and the primary reason why, in the often stodgy world of legal education, Northeastern is considered a renegade. It's &quot;really doing things on a different model,&quot; says Stanford's Prof. Gordon.    In the early 1950s, Northeastern's law program was run as a night school. Shut down in 1955, it reopened in 1968 under the direction of a number of graduates from Harvard's law school, who shaped its curriculum and operating standards in sharp contrast to their alma mater. &quot;Harvard is the establishment, a great school, but this place offered a chance to experiment,&quot; says Daniel Givelber, Northeastern's dean and himself a Harvard law graduate.    The school now has alumni in many major firms in Boston and, increasingly, in other large cities. And over the past five years, about a fourth of its graduates have received prestigious judicial clerkships -- twice the national average.    Even so, the co-op program has its critics, primarily traditionalists who claim it cuts into class time and limits the number of courses offered in specialized areas. Erwin Griswold, former dean of Harvard's law school, praises Northeastern as an &quot;important experiment.&quot; But, he adds, &quot;people have 30 to 50 years of life to get a so-called practical education. You only have three years in law school to dig deeply into intellectual things.&quot;    Nonetheless, Northeastern's professors -- about half of whom hold law degrees from Harvard -- say any sacrifices are far outweighed by the value of experiencing the law in action.    According to Prof. Judith Brown, for example, students can't fully understand the difficulties of employment-discrimination suits &quot;from reading the opinions&quot; in class. &quot;You have to be out there researching things like (the plaintiff's) 'burden of proof'&quot; in real cases, she says.    The lessons learned in the outside world are often lessons in pragmatism. Michelle Schaffer, who graduated last month, spent one of her co-op terms as an assistant to a federal appeals court judge. She watched him make certain decisions based in part on whether they would put him &quot;out on a limb&quot; with other members of the court. Facts and prior cases aren't the only things that determine judicial rulings, she concluded. There are &quot;personal and political motivations&quot; as well.    At Northeastern, this knowledge benefits not only the student but also the student's classmates, supporters say. Northeastern professors have scrapped the Socratic style of interrogation in favor of discussions that frequently revolve around the experiences of the students. Thus, what is encountered outside is shared inside.    During her work off-campus, for example, recent graduate Arlie Scott researched strategies for cancer victims suing cigarette makers. &quot;You see the suits as potentially effective tools to change social policy,&quot; she says. &quot;But also you see how difficult it is for one plaintiff to win a suit&quot; against a corporate defendent. She brought those difficulties up in a class on product liability. The class then considered how to deal with such legal roadblocks as &quot;preemption,&quot; which suggests that the surgeon general's warnings on cigarette packs may absolve tobacco companies of responsibility for their products.    Northeastern has won many admirers among Boston's establishment lawyers. The old-line firm of Palmer andamp; Dodge, for instance, has hired more than a dozen of the school's graduates in recent years. Partner Henry Stewart praises &quot;the maturity and businesslike approach shown by Northeastern students.&quot;    One reason for such praise is that co-op allows Northeastern graduates to join law firms with the gap between law-in-theory and law-in-practice at least partially bridged. Moreover, their co-op experiences allow many students to know upon graduating the kind of law they want to practice. They aren't flailing about on their first jobs, trying to figure out if they really enjoy, say, the world of debt collection.    David Zuckerman, a 28-year-old former music recording engineer, attended Northeastern with the goal of practicing law with &quot;social impact.&quot; But he didn't know which area would interest him most. Then came his co-op stints, with an environmental law organization in Arizona, a corporate firm in Boston, a federal judge in Philadelphia and the public defender agency in Alaska. He finally decided his calling was in criminal defense work -- &quot;fighting for the underdogs,&quot; as he puts it. He will join the Seattle public defender's office this fall.    But Mr. Zuckerman's choice is something of a rarity at Northeastern these days. The school has long tried to steer its students in the direction of those low-paying jobs. Ten years ago, 45% of its graduates went into public-interest and government law. But now only 20% of them do, about 5% above the national average. Many of the rest are being lured away by firms like Palmer andamp; Dodge, which offers a $53,000 annual starting salary. Dean Givelber calls the trend &quot;very disturbing.&quot;    Ironically, co-op is partly responsible for the slide -- and for the same reason that Mr. Zuckerman found it so valuable.    Consider the case of Rebecca Bryant, a 38-year-old former schoolteacher who graduated last month. She attended Northeastern wanting to become a teachers' union lawyer. But she's leaving with a job at Foley, Hoag andamp; Eliot, a blue-chip Boston firm, where she will earn more than $50,000 a year and handle labor relations for large corporate clients.    Quite a turnabout. But Ms. Bryant, like many other Northeastern students, has $30,000 in tuition debt to pay off. Furthermore, she believes she can benefit employees as a &quot;reasonable&quot; negotiator for management. And besides, she found during one of her co-op terms that she actually enjoyed the &quot;high energy&quot; of corporate law. &quot;I never thought I'd be where I am today,&quot; she says. </TEXT></DOC>
