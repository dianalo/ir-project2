Advertising, sparse in the old daily insert, has increased 200% to 300% and is considerably ahead of budget. Circulation has climbed about 15,000 copies, to about 90,000 daily, Herald officials say.    Those signs of success follow an increase in the supplement's size and staff and the addition of conservative guest columnists whose views reflect those of many Hispanic readers and advertisers.    &quot;It's very early to tell, but we're very encouraged,&quot; says Richard Capen, Herald chairman and publisher, and a director of parent Knight-Ridder Inc. &quot;We've seen gains in circulation tied to El Nuevo Herald, and there's also been a step-up in existing Herald subscribers who've added El Nuevo Herald,&quot; which comes free for the asking with the Herald.    The Herald has had a dilemma. As Dade County has grown more Hispanic, the paper's market penetration has fallen. In 1960, 79% of Dade households received the Herald, but by 1985 the number had fallen to 40%; now it is about 38.5%. Consequently, the paper is trying to draw Hispanics, who account for nearly half of its potential hometown audience, without losing Anglo readers.    El Nuevo Herald is an attempt to do that. Last November, the Herald, which simultaneously expanded local Hispanic coverage in its regular edition, drastically redesigned and expanded the insert -- the only newspaper of its kind -- to attract more Cuban and other Hispanic readers who long eschewed the Herald's Anglo and liberal leanings.    At 30 to 32 pages, El Nuevo Herald has 150% more news space than the old eight-to-12-page El Herald, started in 1976. The news staff has grown to 50 people from 23, and more Latin American and Cuban coverage has been added, along with a features section, Action Line and horoscopes.    Perhaps most important, the supplement, though it takes no formal editorial position, now slants sharply to the right of the Herald through guest opinion columns that jibe better with anti-Castro, anti-communism sentiment in Miami.    That hasn't been lost on advertisers. &quot;It was almost a negative thing to advertise in El Herald,&quot; says Robert Perlman, president of BrandsMart U.S.A., an electronics and appliance store that now advertises in the supplement. &quot;They didn't take the proper stance for Cuban people in Miami. That has changed.&quot;    Lombardo Perez, president of Metro Ford in Miami, says the car dealership has tripled its budget for ads in El Nuevo Herald since the new format. &quot;It's a better product and more appealing.&quot; he says. &quot;It seems to be pulling more people from the more prominent Hispanic areas.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
