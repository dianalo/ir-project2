Two $10 billion-plus takeover proposals in the past three days have rewritten Wall Street's definition of how big a takeover can be. They also have taken once-unthinkably large deals beyond the oil patch and into the realm of familiar consumer brands.    RJR Nabisco yesterdy joined Philip Morris Cos. as the second tobacco company to propose a megadeal this week by disclosing it is exploring a $17 billion management buy-out. That would top the biggest deal in history, Chevron Corp.'s $13.2 billion acquisition of Gulf Oil Corp. in 1984. Yet the mammoth RJR proposal came less than three days after Philip Morris launched an $11.4 billion takeover bid for Kraft Inc.    Just as the maturing oil industry was ripe for consolidation in the early 1980s, buyers today are attracted to the strong cash flow, well-known brands and modest capital spending needs of consumer companies. &quot;It's cheaper to buy than build,&quot; explains Thomas Doerflinger, a market strategist at PaineWebber Inc. His firm this week released a list of 16 takeover candidates, studded with consumer-brand companies.    This time, instead of buying oil cheaper on the floor of the stock exchange than it would cost to drill for it, bidders are buying established-brand franchises, such as Kraft's Miracle Whip and Velveeta cheese, rather than risk the high costs of trying to develop new brands.    The latest acquisition bids, thrown into an already hectic welter of takeovers and buy-outs, have also taken this year's merger pace into hyperspeed. &quot;No one predicted the kind of activity we're seeing,&quot; says Bill Kaye, head of arbitrage at PaineWebber. &quot;Everyone knew things had to get better&quot; after last year's market crash, &quot;but no one could have predicted this.&quot;    By some calculations, takeover stocks have become a major source of stock-market strength this year. Steve Einhorn, a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., calculates that one-third of the 12% gain in stock prices this year is derived from takeovers, restructurings and leveraged buy-outs.    What's more, Mr. Einhorn observes, &quot;these deals put a lot of cash in the hands of investors when they're completed. If even a fraction of that finds its way back into the market, that's positive for stocks.&quot;    This year's merger tidal wave is also a product of the 1987 stock-market crash; in the aftermath of Black Monday, stock prices have remained well below last year's peak levels. At the same time, the economy didn't collapse following the crash as some had feared, so target companies remain healthy. Also, the continued weakness of the dollar has encouraged bids from foreign companies, such as the one by Grand Metropolitan PLC this month for Pillsbury Co.    Beyond those fundamentals, financing has been abundantly available in the form of leveraged buy-out funds with an estimated purchasing power of $250 billion. &quot;There's no question that LBO funds are bolder in the deals&quot; they will attempt simply because so much money has been raised, says Joseph Rice, president of Clayton andamp; Dubilier, a New York leveraged buy-out concern.    Another impetus for some of the deals is that the U.S. remains in what merger lawyer Arthur Fleischer calls &quot;an interregnum&quot; before the next president takes office. Some merger professionals believe the next administration, whoever wins, might not be as tolerant of mergers as the Reagan administration.    But an overriding factor in the current acquisition fever is the search for attractive cash flow. With huge amounts of debt needed to pay for megadeals, buyers are seeking targets with rich cash flows to cover interest costs on that debt. &quot;It's large cash flows that can support these LBOs,&quot; and other leveraged takeovers, says Ray Burry, a tobacco analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    (Some define cash flow as the amount of money left over after a company pays all its bills. But it's generally understood as earnings plus depreciation and amortization, minus needed capital spending.)    Ken Hackel, a Fort Lee, N.J., money manager, has built an entire business, Cash Flow Investors Inc., around cash-flow analysis because of its popularity with investors. He says groups that currently show the strongest cash flow include auto makers, health-care companies, pharmaceuticals, basic manufacturing and conglomerates.    Among companies Mr. Hackel considers &quot;ideal takeover candidates&quot;: Clorox Co., ITT Corp., Lance Inc., F.W. Woolworth andamp; Co. and Crown Cork andamp; Seal Co. Among the larger companies he says have strong cash flow are Ford Motor Co., General Electric Co. and American Home Products.    Another cash-flow buff, Robert Raiff, research director of C.J. Lawrence Morgan Grenfell Inc., says that this week's two megadeals mean that companies with $10 billion stock-market valuations are no longer out of reach for bidders.    &quot;The megadeals are coming, and here's the first and second. To some extent, large companies have been overlooked valuewise,&quot; he says, citing ITT and J.C. Penney as examples. He also said buy-out funds may find it more efficient to work on one $20 billion deal, instead of ten $2 billion ones.    Mr. Doerflinger of PaineWebber says his takeover picks include not only consumer-brand companies, but also companies with financial-services franchises, their own special technologies, unique natural resources or excess cash.    Among them are: Bear Stearns Cos., K mart Corp., Kimberly-Clark Corp., Louisiana-Pacific Corp., Manor Care Inc., J.C. Penney, Prime Computer Inc., Sara Lee Corp., Schering-Plough Corp., Unocal and Warner-Lambert Co. He has already hit one with Kraft.    Cash flows are particularly strong at tobacco companies, yet their stock prices have remained depressed by a steady decline in smoking and the threat of damage awards because of smoking deaths. As one merger lawyer put it, &quot;it's an incredibly high cash flow business that everyone's worried about.&quot; Rather than see their companies become targets, RJR and Philip Morris managements are proposing to employ the tobacco companies' huge cash flows to finance megadeals.    RJR managers &quot;obviously feel that their entire industry has been beaten up in the marketplace, and they have made their own internal judgment that that's been overdone,&quot; says Mr. Kaye of PaineWebber. However, several analysts question whether the RJR deal will go through because of its size and the degree of tobacco-related risk.    With stock prices still well below 1987 peaks, analysts also argue that many big companies sell well below their asset, or breakup, value. Goldman's Mr. Einhorn observes that big asset values were bandied about for oil companies in the early 1980s takeover boom, too, prior to the plunge in oil prices.    One major difference this time, Mr. Einhorn notes: &quot;Oil values are subject to wide swings in the price of oil. The consumer sector should be a lot more stable.&quot;    The stability of consumer spending also figured in a spate of takeovers earlier this year among retailers, particularly department stores and grocery chains. For example, Campeau Corp. acquired Federated Department Stores Inc., and Stop andamp; Shop Cos. and Payless Cashways Inc. were also bought out.    Like the oil industry, department stores and grocers have been consolidating at a furious pace. The skids were undoubtedly greased for some retail acquisitions by the fact that the past 12 months have seen the weakest comparison in retailers' same-store sales since the Depression, according to Robert Long, head of high-yield bond research at First Boston Corp.    Mr. Long says slowing revenue growth has also led to consolidation moves in health-care companies, with the buy-out of Charter Medical Corp. and the rejected buy-out proposal for Hospital Corp. of America.    Two other sectors that have high cash flow are utilities and defense contractors. But both are regulated industries, where unwilling targets might take advantage of regulations they operate under to stave off suitors.    Even this week's two megadeals haven't stopped the Wall Street rumor mill. Takeover speculators are still wondering where Ronald Perelman will strike with a promised megadeal of his own, and about a long-rumored $18 billion deal supposedly being cooked up by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.    ---                   Biggest Deals of 1988 Target           Suitor               Price Adviser          Adviser          (in billions)  Status RJR-Nabisco      Management group Dillon Read,     Shearson Lehman                 May be Lazard Freres                         $17.6      proposed Kraft            Philip Morris Goldman Sachs    Wasserstein, Perella  11.4      Proposed Federated Dept.
