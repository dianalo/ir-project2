(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trustee for the financially troubledPTL ministry says he will try to save its religious activities,even if it means selling its Heritage USA theme park.   ``PTL is something much more important than a water park or ahotel,'' David Clark said Friday. ``The heart of PTL must be theministry.''   During a hearing Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds,who extended the deadline for PTL to present a bankruptcyreorganization plan by two weeks to May 16, said it ``looks likethe end of the road'' for the ministry.   PTL officials told Reynolds at the hearing in Greensboro, N.C.,that they couldn't raise the $5.7 million needed by the previousdeadline of May 2.   Reynolds ordered Clark to present a plan that would enable theministry built by Jim and Tammy Bakker to sell whatever isnecessary while continuing to operate.   ``It's definitely a liquidation,'' Reynolds said. ``It's just amatter of how orderly a liquidation.''   The Internal Revenue Service is seeking more than $55 million inback taxes and opposes PTL's plan to qualify as a tax-exemptorganization.   PTL plans to sell 1,700 undeveloped acres it owns on the SouthCarolina-North Carolina border and a small attraction at HeritageUSA in Fort Mill called Farmland USA.   Clark said other assets may have to be sold to preserve theministry's religious activities, including the daily ``PTL Club''show and the satellite TV network.   He told Reynolds the $10 million water park at Heritage USA willnot open this year for lack of money.   Clark also told the judge that people who once financed theministry aren't contributing any more. ``We had a moral bankruptcyin the ministry that led to a financial bankruptcy,'' he said.   He said the ministry laid off about 125 employees Friday,leaving the full-time payroll at about 685. When Clark arrived atPTL on Nov. 1, the ministry had about 1,100 employees.   Clark said representatives of ``a major U.S. financialinstitution'' will meet next week with PTL officials to discuss apossible long-term loan of $45 million.   But Reynolds was skeptical. ``I don't know who would loan youmoney,'' the judge said.   The financial troubles renewed talk that Bakker, who steppeddown last year in a sex and hush-money scandal, may return.   ``The second that Clark fails, Jim will be back,'' said InezBrown, vice president of the Bring Bakker Back Club, which has beenurging supporters to withhold contributions until Bakker returns.</TEXT></DOC>
