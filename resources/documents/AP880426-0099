(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An evacuation rehearsal of the townsurrounding the nation's only methyl isocyanate plant was notrealistic because it was too well planned, critics claim.   Sirens sounded twice about seven minutes apart at Institute tosignal the evacuation, the first coming at 9:19 a.m., 19 minuteslate. One hour later, only about 30 people had arrived at anemergency shelter in nearby South Charleston.   ``The participation of citizens is not all that important,''said Kanawha County Commission President Doug Stump, who calledMonday's exercise successful.   Most residents and workers at businesses and West Virginia StateCollege either skipped work or ignored the drill. Constructionworkers at the college's new science building across the streetfrom one siren continued working.   The town is the site of a Rhone-Poulenc chemical plant thatformerly was owned by Union Carbide Corp. The plant produces methylisocyanate, the chemical that leaked from a Union Carbide plant inBhopal, India, in 1984, killing more than 2,000 people.   Less than a year after the Bhopal disaster, the leak of anotherchemical at the Institute plant injured at least 135 people,prompting the call by some community leaders for an organizedevacuation plan for the town of 1,500.   Local officials built a one-lane emergency road to helpresidents flee, but the gate to that road is kept locked exceptwhen needed. Monday was the first time it was used.   Stump said the drill was designed primarily as a trainingexercise for police, firefighters and other emergency workers.``It's like basic training in the Army; you know the procedures butevery real incident will be different,'' he said.   Monday's evacuation was conducted under special circumstances.West Virginia State College, next door to the plant, called offclasses in the morning, so there were few students to evacuate. Thetown also was evacuated in stages so the roads leading out of townwouldn't be too crowded.   ``When this was prepared, people didn't take it seriously,''said Lois Thurston, a custodian at West Virginia State. ``I'm sureif the students were here, they wouldn't know what was going on.''   ``I can envision cars all over the track. It's just a littletrail. It would be mayhem,'' said Barbara Clark, a health andphysical education instructor at West Virginia State. ``It will bea mess.''   Carla Tyree, a Rhone-Poulenc employee and Institute resident,was among dozens of volunteers who manned the streets to directtraffic, carried out emergency procedures or took notes on Monday'sdrill.   ``All in all I think the community's glad this kind of responseis going on,'' said Tyree. ``I'm sure a lot of persons have learnedwhat to do in an emergency as far as coordinating ... learning whodoes what.''   Rosie McKnight, who lives about a mile from the plant, said shedidn't hear the siren and didn't realize the drill was under wayuntil her husband came by their house.   ``I wanted to participate so they can get an accurate play outon what would happen,'' McKnight said. ``If they're going to spendall that money trying to get this operation, the least we can do isparticipate.''</TEXT></DOC>
