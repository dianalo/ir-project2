It held some 100 million human souls. Two days agoits last bastion fell, stormed by hundreds of thousands ofRomanians enraged by Nicolae Ceausescu's tyranny.   Though the brutal security forces that kept Ceausescu in powerfor 24 years fought back across the country, killing hundreds, itwas clearly the culminating act of a revolution that may deprivethe term ``Soviet bloc'' of any meaning.   A new order in Europe, in the making through 40 years ofrepression and economic failure, suddenly is being born with theblessing and connivance of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   In the 19th century, another European who thought incontinent-wide terms, the French emperor Napoleon, dreamed of a``continental system'' to integrate the territory he conquered fromSpain to Russia. The philosophical father of communism, Karl Marx,predicted a proletarian revolution would sweep Europe.   Now Gorbachev, one of Marx's ideological heirs, preaches thecreation of a ``common European home'' where after years of Kremlindomination, the nations of Eastern Europe will be virtually free topursue policies they set themselves.   The fundamental changes of 1989 mean that the five East bloccountries must set up new governments, reorganize economies andbegin to work out what kinds of relations they will have with theSoviet Union, what ties will be forged with Western countries. Theevents in East Germany raise the special issue of a reunifiedGermany in the heart of Europe.   Gorbachev's vision supplants agreements by the World War IIAllies that led to the continent's division into East and Westafter the defeat of Nazi Germany.   For more than four decades, with the Red Army serving as itsgendarme, Soviet-style communism reigned in Eastern Europe from theBug River on the Soviet-Polish border to the German city of Weimar,where Bach wrote his great fugues. Europe seemed immutably dividedinto socialist and capitalist camps.   The West set up a military alliance, NATO, to deal with anymilitary threat, and the members of the Communist bloc formed theWarsaw Pact.   The schism of Europe had its hated symbol, the Berlin Wall. Itmade concrete Winston Churchill's alarmed rhetoric in 1946 when hetold students at a small college in Missouri that ``from Stettin inthe Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain hasdescended across the continent.''   True, there were rips in that curtain _ when Yugoslavia in thelate 1940s and later Albania successfully rebelled against Moscow'sdomination. But the most stunning changes awaited the advent ofGorbachev and the whirlwind year of 1989.   Beginning in August, hard-line regimes were ousted in Poland,Bulgaria, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and finally Romania. RomanCatholic Tadeusz Mazowiecki became Poland's first non-Communistpremier since World War II.   Czechoslovakia's new government is no longerCommunist-dominated, and Hungary's Parliament has approveddemocratic, multiparty elections next year.   In Berlin, millions of East Germans have poured through newlycut breaches in the wall, personifying the growing symbiosisbetween East and West. Berliners sang and danced with joy Fridaynight when an opening was made in the 28-year-old wall near theBrandenburg Gate, long a symbol of Germany's division.   The five months that remade politics in Eastern Europe passedwith breathtaking speed. With Gorbachev in power, leaders likeCzechoslovakia's Milos Jakes and Bulgaria's Todor Zhivkov, whobankrupted themselves by failing to meet human or economic needs,could no longer count on Kremlin support.   Without that backing, unpopular Communists had to compromisewith the people, or give up power.   In 1942, Josef Stalin raged that the Nazis had ``turned Europeinto a prison of nations.'' But it was the Soviet dictator, hisarmy and his political disciples who would subjugate Central Europeand its inhabitants after driving out the German invaders.   In a sense, revolt began a month after Stalin's death. On anApril morning in 1953, East Berlin construction workers from theStalinallee site went on strike over pay cuts. Within 48 hours theprotests spread throughout the city, with demonstrators chanting``We want to be free and not slaves!'' Mobs tried to take overgovernment headquarters.   The Soviet army commandant in Berlin proclaimed a state of siegeand two motorized divisions occupied the city. Protesters who werecaught were executed. Order was restored by 9 p.m., and the RedArmy moved to crush worker revolts in Leipzig, Dresden andelsewhere.   The scenario was repeated in Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakiain 1968, when Red Army soldiers were sent in to stop reform efforts.   But this fall, when East German leader Erich Honecker's rule wasmenaced by a popular uprising, Soviet troops remained in theirbarracks, and Honecker was deposed Oct. 18.   It was renewed proof of Gorbachev's professed unwillingness tomeddle in the internal affairs of his allies, as well as a way ofgetting rid of an Old Guard Communist who rejected much of hisreform agenda.   ``The truth, about which we spoke so often in the past fewyears, has been reaffirmed once again _ where there is a delay indealing with overripe problems, excesses are inevitable,''Gorbachev told Soviet Communists Dec. 9, warning them their EastEuropean colleagues' fall from power means they must urgently solvedomestic problems.   The Soviets stress the countries they once treated as virtualprovinces of their own nation must remain in the Warsaw Pact,meaning Europe's ``Age of the Blocs'' is not yet over, at leastmilitarily.   But with non-Communist leaders seeking a mix of capitalism andsocialism to better their citizens' lives, the East-Westideological schism is dying.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
