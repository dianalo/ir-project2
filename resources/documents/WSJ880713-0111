Trackers of the cartel's output say it now is up to 19 million barrels a day, despite the talk in OPEC about efforts to curb production excesses to stabilize deteriorating petroleum prices. Some authoritative estimates place output as high as 20 million barrels.    That is about 1.5 million barrels a day above OPEC's June level, and as much as two million barrels a day above the generally estimated need for OPEC oil for the third quarter.    Reasons for the spurting output -- paced by OPEC's Middle East members, including Saudi Arabia -- are not entirely clear. But, with petroleum storage tanks brimming world-wide, the production surge &quot;helps explain the weakness in the oil market,&quot; a senior OPEC official conceded yesterday.    &quot;We are not yet in a free-fall in prices, but we are seeing a free-for-all on OPEC production,&quot; added Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice president of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.    Few oil economists expect to see a repeat of the oil-price crash of early 1986. Nevertheless, petroleum markets remain stubbornly soft despite recurring signals of a possible turnaround, including major gains in petroleum demand and supply interruptions, such as last week's explosion that destroyed the Piper Alpha platform in the North Sea.    On average, world oil prices are down more than $3 a barrel since Jan. 1 to the lowest level since 1986. They fell again yesterday, some by as much as $1 a barrel.    In volatile trading on European spot markets, prices of North Sea Brent crude dropped below $14 a barrel, down between 40 cents and 45 cents from day-earlier levels. On the U.S. futures market, West Texas Intermediate bounced off a 21-month low during the day to close at $14.72 a barrel, down only six cents.    However, major U.S. petroleum refiners -- including Phillips Petroleum Co., Sun Co., USX Corp.'s Marathon Petroleum unit and Coastal Corp. -- reduced their field postings for West Texas Intermediate crude by $1, to $14.25 a barrel. At such a posting, this U.S. benchmark crude is down nearly $6 a barrel from last year's peak price.    Significantly, OPEC crudes generally have dropped below $13 a barrel, which had been believed to be the &quot;trigger&quot; point at which Middle East producers would agree to some action to curb production. Dubai, an important United Arab Emirates crude, currently is being traded at $12.20 to $12.45 a barrel, depending on the delivery date.    The Emirates are, in fact, a target of some OPEC efforts to restore production discipline. In recent weeks, the Emirates had proclaimed the country would ignore its OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels a day and would produce 1.5 million barrels a day.    As a result, Subroto, OPEC's new secretary-general and the former oil minister of Indonesia, plans to visit there to meet with the Emirates' president to discuss oil-market conditions. Yesterday, OPEC sources said Mr. Subroto won't arrive in the Emirates until after going to Saudi Arabia next week for the Hajj, the Moslem pilgrimage to Mecca.    Another effort that may be pursued by OPEC, as previously reported, would be a possible meeting of the price-monitoring committee. This group of five leading oil ministers is charged with monitoring world oil prices and can recommend a course of action including an emergency conference of OPEC. But yesterday, chances of a meeting of the price committee appeared to be fading.    &quot;I don't think the meeting will take place,&quot; a senior OPEC official said. But he said several oil ministers will be in Saudi Arabia for the Hajj. &quot;Maybe they will talk about oil,&quot; he said.    Saudi Arabia is one of the puzzles in the current outpouring of oil. Previously, the kingdom stuck to its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day, while urging others to adhere also to their production allotments. Now, there is some question as to whether the Saudis have become frustrated at the lack of restraint and whether the country, like the others, now sees the OPEC quotas as a floor for production, rather than a ceiling on output.    &quot;The Saudis are aggressively discounting&quot; prices, said Bryan Jacoboski, senior oil analyst at PaineWebber Inc.    It isn't unusual for Saudi production to be up in the first week of a month because of normal commercial commitments and then adjusted later. In the first week of July, however, Saudi Arabia exceeded its production quota by nearly one million barrels a day, according to Petro-Logistics of Geneva, Switzerland, which estimates total OPEC output at 20 million barrels a day.    &quot;But it may be too early to draw the conclusion that Saudi policy is to produce more than quota on a regular basis,&quot; reports Petro-Logistics, which also puts Kuwait's output up sharply.    There are still differences between the current scramble for market share by OPEC's members and that which led to the 1986 price collapse. But one thing worrying oil economists this time is that Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the Emirates seem to be going their separate ways. &quot;The Persian Gulf players aren't coming together with a cohesive point of view,&quot; said Mr. Goldstein of Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. </TEXT></DOC>
