(In-Net) will use the Comnet '89 computer andcommunications trade show next month as a backdrop for the introduction ofits new FDDI fiber-optic network, which can integrate separate Token-Ring orEthernet LANs into a single network.andM;Because of its high bandwidth capacity (100M bps), company officials saidthey envision the new product being used either to interconnect multiplehigh-speed LANs or as a ''host LAN'' that interconnects as many as 16mainframes in a single LAN configuration.andM;The new LAN comprises a FiberTalk Bridge, a FiberTalk Channel Extension Unit(CEU), a FiberTalk Channel Interface Unit (CIU) and a FiberTalk NetworkManagement System (NMS), according to In-Net marketing director JohnMazzaferro.andP;  Recommended for use as the actual backbone of the system is astandard dual-fiber, 100M-bps fiber-optic cable, which users must purchasefrom an independent fiber-optic cable manufacturer, he said.andM;CCITT LANs Link to BackboneandM;Versions of the In-Net FiberTalk 5000 local bridge products may be used toconnect either a CCITT 802.3 Ethernet LAN or a CCITT 802.5 Token-Ring LAN tothe backbone.andM;The modularity of the bridges makes it possible to create multiportoperation, Mazzaferro said.andP;  This allows several Ethernet or Token-Ring LANsto be attached to a single bridge, offering a flexible upgrade path, he said.andM;The FiberTalk 3000 CEU is a channel-to-peripheral input/output (I/O) devicedriver used to link IBM or plug-compatible host processors to geographicallydispersed peripheral devices such as tape, computer-aideddesign/manufacturing (CAD/CAM) and printers via the network.andM;''This unit can operate without any modifications to the mainframe'soperating system or the addition of custom I/O drivers,'' Mazzaferro said,adding that the unit can be placed up to two kilometers apart on the fiberdistributed data interface (FDDI) ring without requiring repeaters for truedistributed processing.andM;Optional Power SuppliesandM;Optical bypass and load-sharing redundant power supplies are available as anoption to ensure complete network uptime, he said.andM;The FiberTalk 3000 CIU provides networkwide compatibility among IBM orplug-compatible host computers, such as the IBM 303X, 308X, 309X and 4300series, as well as Amdahl 5880, 5990 and NAS XL and VL, Mazzaferro said.andM;The FiberTalk 1000 Network Management System is based on the OS/2 operatingsystem, allowing concurrent applications to run on the system while networkinformation is collected and displayed, he said.andP;  Both centralized and remotemanagement of the network can be provided, and either a keyboard or mouse canbe used.andM;The FiberTalk 5000 Bridge units are priced at $30,000, the FiberTalk 3000CEUs and CIUs at $30,000 each, and the FiberTalk Network Management System at$8,000.andP;  The new system is slated to be available in May or June.andP;  In-Net, ofSan Diego, can be reached at (619) 487-3693.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
