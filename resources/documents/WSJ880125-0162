Paddon, chairman and chief executive officer.    The company, which sells and leases computers and electronic equipment, had net of $1.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 32% to $21.7 million from $16.4 million. The company noted there were 6.5 million shares outstanding this year compared with 5.1 million last year.    Pretax operating profit rose 33% to about $3.1 million from about $2.4 million, Mr. Paddon said.    Profit for the latest quarter was bolstered by an approximate $1.4 million one-time gain from an accounting adjustment, Mr. Paddon said. Minus the gain, profit was $1.9 million, or 30 cents a share -- slightly less than a Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. forecast of 32 cents a share. Nevertheless, Mr. Paddon said he is &quot;comfortable&quot; with Kidder Peabody's fiscal 1988 forecast of $1.35 a share, which doesn't include the one-time accounting gain.    In an interview, Mr. Paddon attributed the profit increase mainly to higher sales. Gross profit margins were unchanged in the period, he said. Selling, general and administration expenses fell slightly to 4.1% of revenue from 4.2% a year ago.    Mr. Paddon said the company added 12 sales people in January, bringing the total to 50. In July, the company plans to hire an additional 20 to 30 salespeople, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
