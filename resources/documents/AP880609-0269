The meetings, taking place on the sidelines of a three-day Arabsummit, involve discussions between the two opposing wings of theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   The six oil ministers from Algeria, Libya, Iraq, Saudi Arabia,Qatar and the United Arab Emirates met in advance of the scheduledJune 11 meeting of OPEC in Vienna, hoping to resolve theirdifferences in informal talks.   Algeria and Libya advocate production cuts while Saudi Arabiaand the Gulf emirates have defended their production levels. Thesplit between the two camps led to the failure of an April meetingbetween OPEC and a number of non-OPEC oil exporters.   The non-OPEC countries had offered to reduce their overalloutput by 5 percent, or 183,000 barrels per day, on condition theOPEC group made a matching 5 percent cut.   The OPEC countries, which have a current overall productionceiling of 15.06 million barrels per day, offered to match theproposed non-OPEC cut barrel-per-barrel, but could not agree on anoverall 5 percent cut, which would have lowered their ceiling byabout 750,000 barrels per day.   Indonesia's oil minister, Ginanjar Kartasasnita, earlier thisweek called on the Arab OPEC members to resolve their differencesat the Algiers summit to help stabilize prices.   The sources, participants in the talks who spoke on conditionthey not be identifed, said the informal discussions in Algiers haddisclosed three factions among the Arab OPEC members.   The Saudi-led group was demanding that current production levelsbe left unchanged, while the Algeria group called for a sharpproduction cut for the third quarter of 1988, with a possibility ofrenewed increases in the fourth quarter to take account of higherwinter demand. A third group advocated simple alignment with worldprices and demand, the sources said.   The sources said they doubted the differences would be resolvedbefore the Arab ministers traveled to Vienna next week.   Iraq, which has refused to be bound by its OPEC-fixed productionceiling, also took part in the talks, the sources said. Iraq hasdemanded a production quota equal to that of its Gulf war enemy,Iran.</TEXT></DOC>
