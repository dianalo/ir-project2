 Michael Kaminski of General Motors may not be all there yet,but his support for manufacturing integration standards makes him a rolemodel for integration proponents.andM;Designers need MAP, engineers need MAP, assembly lines need MAP--to hearKaminski tell it, even painting robots need MAP.andP;  So why does the chiefmissionary of MAP/TOP (Manufacturing Automation Protocol/Technical and OfficeProtocols) and one of MAP's developers routinely sound as if the heretics arewinning?andM;&quot;It's so simple,&quot; said Kaminski, manager of CIM/Network Technology at GeneralMotors, Warren, Mich.andP;  &quot;We went over to Truck and Bus [a GM manufacturingdivision in nearby Pontiac, Mich.] and they had a paint shop they neededhooking up.andP;  So we called some vendors who supported MAP, and they told usthat it would take a couple of weeks to install.andP;  Well, proprietary-vendorselection generally takes five or 10 weeks alone, and it takes another six oreight weeks to install.&quot;andM;At Truck and Bus, J.M.andP;  Rathsburg, the plant superintendent, said, &quot;We aretotally depend on MAP's operation, and it has never let us down.&quot;andM;Not all manufacturers have been so gratuitous.andP;  MAP costs too much up front,they say.andP;  MAP requires scrapping a large chunk of installed hardware andsoftware.andP;  MAP does not offer the rich variety of applications thatproprietary links support.andP;  MAP sales represented less than 1% of all factorynetwork products purchased in 1988, according to The Yankee Group, aBoston-based market research firm [Software Magazine, January 1989].andM;&quot;I read in [an] article where this guy says there's no application softwareout there,&quot; Kaminski said.andP;  'So I call him up and say, 'Have you reallylooked for some?andP;  We've got software all over the place here.'andP;  There aresome people who are very unknowledgeable about technology and, dammit, theyought to find out about it.&quot;andM;Vendors Kaminski cited as most supportive of solutions incorporating MAPprotocols are Retix of Santa Monica, Calif., and Touch Communications Inc.,andO;Campbell, Calif.andP;  He noted also that Lotus Development Corp., Cambridge,Mass., recently announced a 1-2-3 module that supports MAP protocols.andO;Microsoft plans a similar module for its Excel spreadsheet.andM;IBM, Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard have all voiced support forMAP 3.0, but H-P was the first to announce products.andP;  Oracle Corp., Belmont,Calif., and Ingres Corp., Alameda, Calif., have plans to deliver versions ofthe DBMS products for the MAP market as well.andM;He does admit that some vendors have been reluctant to embrace MAP becausemany users will not buy into systems where there is a perceived lack ofapplications--a &quot;self-fulfilling prophecy,&quot; he called it.andM;Further, even though the percentage of American manufacturers that haveadopted MAP is still in the single digits, the U.S.andP;  MAP/TOP User Groupreports 1,500 individual members in 750 companies.andP;  And its 14-companysteering committee includes some big names--not just GM, but companies likeAlcoa, Boeing, Deere, Dupont, Eastman Kodak, General Dynamics,Hewlett-Packard and Xerox.andM;SELLING MAP OVERSEASandM;Kaminski's devotion to integration has given him the title of &quot;Mr.andP;  MAP.&quot;andO;MAP is as much a part of his nature as the Detroit air he breathes, andKaminski is as Detroit as Motown, the Red Wings--or GM.andP;  His devotion to MAPspills into the international auto arena as he laments that the Americanconsumer has not acknowledged the strides GM has made to build a car &quot;just asgood as the Japanese cars.&quot;andM;Japan is one of the places where Kaminski has successfully sold the MAP/TOPconcept.andP;  And Japan's user group is very much a part of the World Federationof MAP/TOP User Groups.andM;Yes, the concept of MAP seems to have penetrated both Japan and Europe moreeffectively than in the U.S., but that is likely a product of &quot;our ruggedindividualism,&quot; Kaminski said.andP;  &quot;It makes us great innovators, but asinnovators we've got to be able to think in terms of what the world has theability to use, and they're [the Japanese and Europeans] better at gettingtogether to produce what the world needs.andM;&quot;We've got to learn their implementation--how to get products into themainstream quickly.andP;  We need to learn their distribution techniques, and theyneed to learn our development techniques.&quot;andM;According to Kaminski, it is jealousies between software vendors that haveslowed the acceptance of MAP/TOP in the U.S., especially the reluctance ofvendors to push MAP's broadband, multi-channel communications links insteadof single-channel links like DEC's Ethernet and IBM's Token-Ring.andP;  &quot;Usingbroadband is like using a water main instead of 50 different pipes.andP;  It'smore expensive up front, but it has better reliability.&quot;andM;One need only look at the chaos of vendors represented on a typical GMfactory floor to see the need for something like MAP, he said.andM;Before MAP's inception, GM was dealing with 14 vendors of communicationslinks between &quot;islands of information&quot; that used as many as 40,000programmable tools, instruments, controls and systems.andP;  The idea was toshorten the time it takes to get a car from concept to dealer showroom fromfive years to three years, with no sacrifice of quality.andP;  Time-to-market andquality have been Detroit's twin bugaboos, Kaminski admitted.andM;&quot;We've gotten a lot better,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;What's more important thancommunications?andP;  That's what MAP is all about.&quot;andM;To get MAP where it is supposed to be going, Kaminski has been known tocajole and charm, but also to shout and swear.andP;  Pat Van Doren perceives somesubtle calculation behind whichever facade Kaminski adopts.andM;Van Doren is general manager of Industrial Cooperative Services Inc., aDetroit firm that provides administrative services to groups like MAP/TOP.andO;For three years, her primary client has been Kaminski.andM;&quot;Mike's easy.andP;  He's direct about what he likes--very direct--and it's veryclear when he's unhappy.andP;  He doesn't hold back, he yells, but when he's doneit's over and he moves on.andP;  And he does admit he isn't always right,&quot; shesaid.andM;Vn Doren said that, at a recent meeting of the World Federation in Australia,Kaminski was negotiating with Japanese delegates, and he knew a show oftemper was the worst possible way to convince anyone in the Japanese cultureof anything.andM;&quot;I knew he was coming to a boil, but he was careful with the Japanese,&quot; shesaid.andP;  &quot;He would tell the interpreter, 'Please tell these delegates it'sokay.'andP;  Back in the States, he would have sworn and pounded on the table.&quot;andM;That is what he is apt to do with many manufacturing people, who arenotoriously conservative when it comes to adopting new systems or techniques,Van Doren said.andP;  &quot;He knows where he's going.andP;  He has a clear vision of theother end, so he pushes them.andP;  And sometimes they don't want to hear what theresults are going to be; they're confused and scared.&quot;andM;Kaminski said his biggest obstacle has been the DECs and the IBMs of thevendor community, but here tense becomes important.andP;  He no longer ays theyare; they have been.andM;Even Digital Equipment Corporation's Ken Olsen, Kaminski's nemesis for thepast two years, &quot;is coming around.andP;  Digital is working on a MAP version ofEthernet,&quot; he said.andM;But Kaminski said that only after saying, &quot;Ken Olsen is a fantastic guy buthe's inflexible.andP;  He's not infallible.andP;  He made a mistake by saying Unixwasn't going anywhere and he made a mistake by saying workstations weren'tgoing anywhere.&quot;andM;Vendors have as much to gain from MAP as users, he insists.andP;  Kaminski saidthat vendor benefits include a reduction of duplicated efforts and fasterdevelopment.andM;&quot;Vendors and users must work together.andP;  IF you're a vendor, don't come to mewith a solution and say, 'Here guy.'andP;  Leths work on it together.andP;  Let's argueabout it if we have to, until we agree on something workable.andP;  Once we'vedone that, then they get the benefit of selling and we get the benefit ofusing,&quot; he said.andM;Those benefits certainly are apparent at GM Truck and Bus.andP;  PlantSuperintendent Rathsburg said, &quot;MAP is very definitely what it is cracked upto be.andP;  It's everything we ever expected and wanted it to be.andP;  The onlyreservation I had, and still have, is about the widespread embrace of thetechnology.andP;  When is the rest of the world going to get on board and do it?&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
