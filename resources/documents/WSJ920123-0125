Wouldn't it be great if,instead of typing in all that text, you could wave a sort ofmagic wand over it and have it show up on your screen, justwhere you want it?   You can. The Typist, a handheld device that costs under$500, will rapidly copy printed text directly into anelectronic document in your computer, at whatever point youdesire.   This gadget is ready to work at the touch of a button,without making you move out of your favorite word processor,spreadsheet or database program. You just roll the Typistover the printed page, and the words or numbers pour ontoyour screen at the cursor, as if keyed in by an invisibleassistant.   Made by Caere, Los Gatos, Calif., the Typist works withboth IBM-compatible computers and Apple's Macintosh models;on IBM-compatibles it can function with both regular programsand those that run under Microsoft's Windows software system.   To understand why the Typist is noteworthy, a bit ofbackground about scanners is in order. Best described ascopying machines for computers, scanners read paper documents-- or &quot;hard copy&quot; -- and convert their text to electronicform for use on PC screens. Scanners come in two types:flatbed machines that scan pages whole, and hand-held models,including the Typist, that read pages a portion at a time.   But personal-computer owners most often use scanners forgetting pictures, not text, into computers. That's becausethe raw electronic version of whatever the devices scanamounts to a graphic, or picture. Scanned text initially isjust a snapshot of the words and numbers on the paper, andcan't be edited.                                                                                                          TO TURN the snapshot into fodder for your word processor,you usually must go through two or three steps, usingscanning software, then optical character recognition, orOCR, software, which tries to convert the picture of the textinto real words and numbers. The final step is loading theresulting file into your word processing program.   The Typist, in contrast, is tailored for text. Itcompresses all these steps into a single process that can becarried out while your word processing program is running.You just position the Typist on the paper and push thebutton, and the computer switches into scanning mode.   After you roll the Typist over the desired text andrelease the button, a window appears on screen showing thatthe scanner's built-in OCR software is translating thepicture of the text into electronic words and numbers. Thenthe device &quot;types&quot; the text into your on-screen document.   Still, the Typist isn't for everyone. For one thing, usingit requires a hefty computer: an IBM-compatible with at leasta 386 processor chip and four megabytes of memory, or aMacintosh with the same relatively large memory. And it costsup to twice as much as a routine hand-held scanner: about$400 at discount stores or by mail order for theIBM-compatible model, and about $90 more (because an externalconnection box is required) for the Macintosh model.   Moreover, using the Typist isn't always as effortless asit is designed to be. The machine's scanning process dependson settings for brightness and a few other factors displayedin a box on the screen. I found trial and error is necessaryto get these settings just right so the Typist scans in textwith few enough errors to make the process quicker thanmanual typing.                                                                                                          IT ALSO takes practice to learn how to roll the Typistsmoothly over a page. And some kinds of text -- includingfaxes and newspaper stock tables -- were so tiny or varied inshading that they wouldn't scan in correctly.   Nevertheless, in testing a dozen different documents, Ifound the Typist able to read in hundreds of words at a timewith few characters missed or garbled. After some practice, Icould accurately scan portions of articles from thisnewspaper and others directly into a variety ofwordprocessing programs. I scanned excerpts from typedreports as well as printed government and business documents.Most scans took only a few minutes, some just seconds.   Though the Typist, like all hand-held scanners, can readin only part of a page at a time, it is able to merge partialscans and eliminate any overlap. It can also scan graphicsinstead of text, and Caere recently beefed up the unit'sbuilt-in graphics software for altering scanned artwork (tostress this, it calls the latest version Typist PlusGraphics).   If you need to copy large volumes of text into yourcomputer, you may be better off with flatbed scanners, thoughthey cost about twice as much as the Typist and require theuse of separate OCR software. If the printed matter you copyvaries widely in quality and type, or is often blurry ortiny, you might find the Typist too frustrating to useregularly.   But if you must often retype modest sections of text fromthe same kinds of printed publications, the Typist can vastlyspeed your work and help you get the most from your computer.</TEXT></DOC>
