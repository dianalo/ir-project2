Bernard L. Cohen, professor of physics, reported at a meeting of the American Chemical Society that his studies found that areas with high radon emissions had low lung cancer rates. He said his evidence contradicts the EPA view that lung cancer rates are directly proportional to emissions of radon, a radioactive gas given off by natural radium which is widely found in soil and rocks.    Although the findings are &quot;very preliminary,&quot; Mr. Cohen said they show that there may be a threshold level for all radiations before they threaten human health. Hence, he said, &quot;We cannot say that low-level radon emissions cause cancer.&quot;    The threshold theory, if upheld by further scientific evidence, carries major implications. Many companies are under pressure to spend huge sums to contain low radiation levels both from their current manufacturing operations as well as landfills where they buried radioactive wastes. Moreover, says Mr. Cohen, if his conclusions are correct, &quot;You don't have to worry about the number of dental X-rays, and many other low-level exposures.&quot;    The EPA finds Mr. Cohen's results inconclusive. Richard Cothern, a physicist on the EPA's science advisory board, said Mr. Cohen's results, although useful, would have little influence on the agency's standards for radon emission to be announced next spring. The agency estimates health risks on a &quot;linear relationship&quot; between exposure and fatalities, he said. &quot;We're being conservative. The whole game is to save lives.&quot;    Radon is a naturally occurring odorless, tasteless gas that can't be detected by human senses. It has long been known that uranium miners, who inhale high concentrations of radon, have a high risk of lung cancer. The EPA estimates that between 5,000 to 20,000 people die of lung cancer in the U.S. annually from radon in indoor air.    The primary source of radon is soil, but groundwater also gives off radon when it's used for showering and cooking and washing clothes and dishes. About 1% to 7% of the fatalities are caused by radon released from water, according to the EPA.    Mr. Cothern of the EPA advisory board declined to discuss the standards for radon that the agency is considering under the Safe Drinking Water Act. He indicated, however, that whatever standards the agency might impose would put many municipal water supply sources out of compliance.    The EPA's current emission standard for radium is five picocuries per liter, a standard that corresponds to a risk whereby one of 10,000 people exposed to such an emission level over a lifetime would die. This is the highest level of risk allowed for any contaminant under the law. &quot;If we set the radon standard at the same level, half of the water supply sources would be out of compliance,&quot; Mr. Cothern said.    He said the cost of aeration or treatment to reduce radon emission from water would add 5% to 10% to municipal water rates. He said water treatment equipment that could be easily installed in homes would cost between $1,500 and $2,000. &quot;The costs are reasonable,&quot; he said.    Mr. Cohen of the University of Pittsburgh measured radon exposures in homes in Finland, Sweden, China and 415 counties in the U.S. He found that in high radon areas in the U.S., where the usual risk estimates would increase the lung cancer rate by 200%, the data showed a decrease of 18%. He said the study was confined to women because they are generally less affected by smoking, which also causes lung cancer.    In a separate study by Mr. Cohen, 40 counties were selected on the basis of highest and lowest female lung cancer rates in the nation. In every case, he said, the radon level was much lower than the cancer rates predicted in high lung cancer counties and much higher than cancer rates predicted in low lung cancer counties. He said the average radon level in the low lung cancer counties was about twice that in the high lung cancer counties.    Mr. Cohen said that while one could never rule out the possibility of statistical error, seven different ways of calculating his data showed consistent negative correlation between lung cancer and low-level radiation. A possible explanation could rest in &quot;a going theory that low-level radiation stimulates the human immune system,&quot; he said. However, he added, more studies need to be done. </TEXT></DOC>
