The Beverly Hills, Calif.-based leasing company's pending purchase, which may be the largest-ever single jetliner order, has been the object of an intense competition among the world's three principal jet aircraft makers.    Industry sources said Seattle-based Boeing received 80% of the order, while Airbus Industrie, the European consortium based in Toulouse, France, got the remainder. The sources also said General Electric Co.'s aircraft engine division would supply most of the engines for the planes.    Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease, would say only that his company decided on the key elements of the order Wednesday and was delaying until Monday the announcement of the winners. The company had said it expected to announce terms of the order late this week.    Spokesmen for Boeing and General Electric also declined to comment. A spokesman for St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglas Corp., which apparently is excluded from the transaction, said that aircraft maker had &quot;never seriously considered ourselves a candidate.&quot;    U.S. spokesmen for Airbus didn't return telephone calls.    The leasing company last week announced its intention to buy as many as 120 planes, including options, in sizes ranging from medium-range, twin-engine jets to four-engine jumbo jets. At that time, Mr. Udvar-Hazy said Boeing was offering the newest models of its 737, 757 and 767 twin-jet series, and the four-engine jumbo 747. Airbus, which is supported by four European nations, offered the A-320, A-330 and A-310 twin jets, and the four-engine, long-range A-340, Mr. Udvar-Hazy said.    The planes are designed to meet International Lease's fleet needs between 1991 and 1995, Mr. Udvar-Hazy said. He declined to say whether the company, which typically purchases aircraft and leases them on a short- or medium-term basis to airlines, already had lined up airlines to operate the aircraft. International Lease's biggest previous order was last year's 19-plane purchase of several Boeing models for a total of $1.15 billion.    The world's largest aircraft order to date is thought to be British Airways' $2.3 billion purchase of 16 Boeing 747s in 1986, which would have a value of $4.1 billion if 12 options for other jumbo jets are exercised.    In national over-the-counter trading, International Lease shares closed unchanged yesterday at $15. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares closed unchanged at $48.375; McDonnell Douglas shares closed at $63.625, down 12.5 cents, and General Electric shares closed at $39, up 25 cents.    Mr. Udvar-Hazy previously indicated that the order would be for all-Boeing aircraft or a combination of Airbus or McDonnell Douglas aircraft. However, he said yesterday that the order was expanded, allowing International Lease to change the mix of sources for its order. </TEXT></DOC>
