On May 1, 1989, we presented a questionnaire to theGovernment of Venezuela in Washington, DC concerning petitioner's allegations.On June 9 and 12, 1989, we received responses from the Government of Venezuelaand Sulfatos del Orinoco, C.A. (SULFORCA).<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), as provided for in section 1201<T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-headings are provided for convenience andCustoms purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The product covered by this investigation is aluminuim sulfate from Venezuela,which is used in water purification, in waste water treatment, and forother industrial applications. Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandisewas classifiable under item 417.1600 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA). Thismerchandise is currently classifiable under HTS item 2833.22.00.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>Conistent with our practice in preliminary determinations, when a responseto an allegation denies the existence of a program, receipt of benefitsunder a program, or eligibilty of a company or producer under a program,and the Department has no persuasive evidence showing that the responseis incorrect, we accept the response for purposes of the preliminary determination.All such responses, however, are subject to verification under section776(b) of the Act. If the response cannot be supported at verificationand a program is otherwise countervailable, the program will be considereda subsidy in our final determination.For purposes of this preliminary determination, the period for which weare measuring subsidies (the review period) is calendar year 1988.Based on our analysis of the petition and the responses to our questionnaire,we preliminarily determine the following:<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Be Used</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that producers or exporters in Venezuela ofthe subject merchandise did not receive benefits during the review periodfor exports of the subject merchandise to the United States under the followingprograms:A. Export Bond ProgramThe Fund for Financing Exports (FINEXPO) was established in 1973 to promotethe export of non-traditional goods and services of Venezuelan origin.The export bond program is administered by FINEXPO. Under this program,exporters are remunerated for their exports by the Government of Venezuelain the form of export bonds which may be used to pay taxes or sold forcash. The value of the export bond is based on a percentage, known as theexport bond percentage, of the FOB value of the product exported. The applicableexport bond percentage for a company corresponds to that company's nationalvalue added percentage.B. Short-Term FINEXPO FinancingUnder this program, FINEXPO, in conjunction with Venezuelan commercialbanks, provides short-term loans to Venezuelan exporters. Export receivables,such as drafts under letters of credit, are used as collateral. FINEXPOprovides up to 60 percent of the loan principal for these loans at fivepercent interest to the participating commercial bank. The commercial bankprovides the remaining loan principal amount and is required to chargethe exporter an average of the FINEXPO rate and its own commercial rate.C. Other FINEXPO ProgramsFINEXPO operates a veriety of programs which provide financing at perferentialrates to Venezuelan exporters and, under one program, foreign importersof Venezuelan goods. Operations or capital needs for which companies canreceive this financing include feasibility studies, market research, promotionalexpenses, fixed capital investment, working capital, inventory financing,financing of services rendered abroad, and financing for importers representingforeign state-owned companies.D. Preferential Tax IncentivesCertain tax benefits are available to Venezuelan manufacturers under Decrees1775 and 1776, which were promulgated in December 1982. Decree 1775 establishedtax credits for manufacturers of finished or intermediate goods based ontheir level of domestic value-added. Eligible companies could receive taxcredits ranging from 10 to 25 percent of the value of new investments dependingon the percentage of domestic value-added of the acquired asset. Theserates of credit applied only in the three years subsequent to the publicationof the decree after which the rate fell to 10 percent for all eligibleinvestments.Decree 1776 seeks to stimulate the domestic production of capital goodsin order to reduce Venezuela's dependence on foreign supplies of technology.The decree sets out a series of tax benefits for makers of specific capitalgoods which are listed in the decree. Eligible companies may receive avariety of fiscal and financial incentives.E. Financing Company of Venezuela Loans (FIVCA)FIVCA was established in 1976 as a financing subsidiary of the IndustrialBank of Venezuela. Its objective is to provide long-term financing to theVenezuelan industrial sector according to the economic policies establishedby the Government of Venezuela.F. Other Government Loans and Loan GuaranteesPetitioner alleges that preferential government loans and loan guaranteesare provided by the following institutions:andbullet; Ministry of Finance (MOF).andbullet; Venezuelan Investment Fund (FIV).andbullet; Industrial Bank of Venezuela (BIV).According to the response, MOF is responsible for the planning and implementationof economic and financial policy for the Government of Venezuela and doesnot provide loans of any kind. FIV provides capital to finance major investmentsin basic industries and BIV operates as a commercial bank. The responsestates that FIV and BIV had no outstanding loans to SULFORCA during thereview period.With respect to loan guarantees, the response states that the Governmentof Venezuela does not offer loan guarantees to private companies eitherdirectly or through any governmental agency. BIV offers loan guaranteesin the ordinary course of business under terms and conditions that reflectordinary commercial banking practice as well as the credit risk of theparticular customer. According to the response, BIV did not issue any loanguarantees with respect to SULFORCA during the review period.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Programs Preliminarily Determined Not To Exist</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that the following program does not exist:Sales Tax ExemptionsPetitioner alleges that the Government of Venezuela, through various regionalauthorities, provides sales tax exemptions to specific enterprises or industriesin Venezuela. The response states that there is no such benefit providedby the Government of Venezuela.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Programs for Which Additional Information Is Needed</ITAG>We preliminarily determine that we need additional information to determinewhether the following programs confer a benefit on the manufacture, production,or exportation of aluminum sulfate from Venezuela:A. Preferential Pricing of Inputs The petitioner alleges that government-owned firms are providing sulfuricacid, aluminum hydrate, and electricity to SULFORCA at preferential rates.In its response, SULFORCA confirmed that it purchased these inputs solelyfrom government-owned suppliers. The response also reported the bases forthe prices charged by the suppliers: (1) Petroquimian de Venezuela S.A.(PEQUIVEN), SULFORCA's sulfuric acid supplier, bases its price on its ownproduction costs and the cost of the imported product; (2) Interamericanade Aluminia, C.A. (INTERALUMINA), SULFORCA's aluminum sulfate supplier,establishes its monthly price based on a formula comprising several costfactors; and (3) Electricficacion del Caroni, C.A. (EDELCA), SULFORCA'selectricity supplier, determines its price based on the level of consumptionof the customer or the level of tension supply to the customer. We preliminarily determine that the information provided in the responseis not sufficient to make a determination that inputs are being providedto a specific enterprise or industry, or group of enterprises or industries,at preferential rates. Therefore, we intend to gather information for ourfinal determination. B. Multiple Exchange Rate System In <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain ElectricalConductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela </T3>(53 FR 24763, June 30,1988), we found that redraw rod producers were able to buy imports at thefixed exchange rate and to convert a portion of their export earnings atthe free market exchange rate, which was substantially higher. We determinedthat the exchange of export earnings under this multiple exchange systemconferred an export subsidy. During verification, however, we found thatthere was a change in the multiple exchange rate system in December 1986which eliminated the differential between the rate for purchasing importsand the rate at which export proceeds were converted. Therefore, we determinedthat the benefit to exporters of redraw rod under the multiple exchangerate system was eliminated. Since petitioner did not allege new facts orprovide information or changed circumstances, we did not include this programin our initiation. In response to general questions concerning exchange rates, the Governmentof Venezuela stated in its response in this investigation that there werechanges in the December 1986 exchange rate regime in October 1988 and March1989. The October change permitted exporters who waived the fiscal incentiveto exchange export earnings at the free market exchange rate. In March,a free market exchange rate was adopted for all purposes, including importsand exports. While SULFORCA stated in its response that it did not use fiscal incentivesduring 1988, neither do we have any information that it used the free marketexchange rate during this period. Therefore, we intend to gather informationfor our final determination. Verification In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we will verify the informationused in making our final determination. ITC Notification In accordance with section 703(f) of the Act, we will notify the ITC ofour determination. In addition, we are making available to the ITC allnon-privileged and non-proprietary information relating to this investigation.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under an administrative protectiveorder, without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for ImportAdministration. If our final determination is affirmative, the ITC will make its finaldetermination 45 days after the Department makes its final determination.Public Comment In accordance with andSection; 355.38 of the Department's regulations publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR section 355.38), we will hold a public hearing, if requested,to afford interested parties an opportunity to comment on this preliminarydetermination on August 18, 1989, at 1:00 p.m., at the U.S. Departmentof Commerce, Room 3708, 14th Street and Constitution Avenue NW., Washington,DC 20230.
