 Metaphorically, LANs provide the perfectcomputing resource, allowing individuals to contribute their efforts toward acommon goal, more so than the standalone PC, minicomputer, or even themainframe.andM;The problem with LANs is that most users require only a fraction of theprocessing and storage power idling on or under their desktops.andP;  Unlike amainframe or mini, which has centralized resources, a network's power isbroken into smaller bundles and flung over a wide area, both geographicallyand logically.andP;  Each user is the proprietor of a static amount of disk spaceand CPU power, which, if unused, simply goes to waste.andM;LANs are ripe for distributed applications.andP;  Now that the novelty ofintegrating standalone machines has worn off, users are looking for ways toreally take advantage of all the processing power on a network.andP;  &quot;It'sdefinitely an area where there is percolating interest,&quot; says RichardVillars, manager of computer networking strategies at IDC, a market researchfirm in Framingham, Mass.andM;While distributing applications over a LAN to make the most efficient use ofall resources may hold a certain intellectual challenge, it's mainly usefulbecause it is economical.andP;  The introduction of specialized machines, liketransaction processors and graphics workstations, make it more practical todesign applications that take advantage of each machine's abilities.andP;  Oneexpensive compute server can be shared by many users, including those whoaren't even aware it exists.andP;  If an application is network-aware, the userdoesn't have to be.andM;The PC LAN industry has recently embraced the client-server model.andP;  The firstapplications to be ported to this architecture are databases.andM;In this model, one portion of the application runs at a powerful server, therest runs at the users' workstations.andP;  The client-server model can beconsidered the simplest form of distributed processing, but true distributedprocessing involves much more.andP;  An application can't be client-server withoutusing distributed processing, but a distributed processing application doesnot have to be based on the client-server model.andP;  In the client-server model,the division of labor is decided when the application is designed and coded.andO;In distributed processing, one computer dynamically decides to send a portionof the program to another computer, because that computer is either idle oris better suited to the task.andM;Most distributed processing applications are built around high-end Unixmachines, although it is feasible to build a distributed application aroundOS/2.andP;  DOS, being single-tasking and single-user, is not suited to thestringent demands of a distributed application.andP;  Today, the majority of thedevelopment environments are for Unix.andP;  As OS/2 becomes more popular,however, its role in distributed processing may increase.andM;Distributed applications are used in complex, high-end situations.andP;  Suchapplications are normally restricted to power users, with either vastdatabases or tasks that require several specialized machines.andP;  The Universityof Iowa's Center for Simulation and Design Optimization of Mechanical Systemsis one such power user.andP;  The Center, which was one of eleven winners of theComputerworld Smithsonian awards for Innovative Applications in InformationTechnology, uses Hewlett-Packard's distributed processing development toolkit to distribute the compute-intensive process of mechanical modeling over aheterogeneous network.andP;  The Center researches new techniques for real-timesimulation and design optimization for mechanical systems, such as aircraftor other vehicles.andM;More than 2,000 users work on the 100 Apollo workstations residing on theUniversity's Computer-Aided Engineering Network.andP;  One project conducted atthe Center was a real-time performance simulation of the Army's new HighMobility Multi Purpose Vehicle.andM;The Center's researchers used several workstations to simulate the vehicle'sprototype.andP;  An Alliant mini-supercomputer runs the actual simulationroutines, which are graphically displayed on Apollos.andP;  The modeling was donein real time, where users could dynamically change the vehicle's speed or thelane it was driving in, as well as in slow motion for detailed mechanicalanalysis.andM;LANheads have been buzzing about distributed processing for years, but so farno distributed applications for the typical business user have come tofruition, mainly because of the problems inherent in developing them.andO;Application developers have to write interfaces for a variety of differenthardware platforms, network operating systems, and operating systems, whichis a miserable process at best and prohibitively expensive at worst.andO;Furthermore, while distributed applications are cheaper for the user, theyare not always profitable for the software developer.andM;The LAN world needs development environments.andP;  No vendor wants to sell onecopy of a distributed application that will be used by 50 people, when itcould sell 50 copies of the same standalone application.andP;  Software licensingis necessary.andM;Three PlatformsandM;Several companies sell development environments to smooth software designers'way.andP;  Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC, Maynard, Mass.), Hewlett-Packard (HP,Palo Alto, Calif.) and Sun Microsystems (Mountain View, Calif.) havestandards-based tool kits and applications to enable independent softwarevendors to create distributed applications without having to worry about theplethora of protocols and platforms.andP;  They also provide licensing schemesthat financially protect the developers.andM;Network Application Support (NAS) is DEC's name for its development toolsthat allow users to build distributed applications over multivendor systems.andO;NAS software has four components: Applications Access Services,Communications Services, Information and Resource Sharing Services, andSystem Services.andM;To be truly practical, a development environment must support a variety ofhardware, network operating systems, and operating systems.andP;  All NASservices, according to DEC, are built on a standards-based architecture andprovide a developer with tool kits, libraries, and products to writeapplications that will take advantage of the information and resources over aheterogeneous network.andP;  Workstations supported include VT-type and 3270terminals, VMS and Ultrix workstations, PCs running DOS or OS/2, andMacintoshes.andP;  The network servers are limited to DEC's VAXs and RISCcomputers.andM;NAS provides services that let users access applications and share data overa variety of systems.andP;  Windowing Services let developers incorporate aDECwindows interface into applications that will reside on dissimilarsystems.andP;  Terminal Services provide VT-type terminal emulation.andP;  ApplicationControl Services lets a developer create hot links between applications,either to offload processing or for sharing data.andM;DEC's Compound Document Architecture (CDA) lets users integrate text andgraphics culled from a variety of systems into one document.andP;  CompoundDocument Services include a CDA Toolkit, CDA Viewers, CDA Converter Library,and DECimage Application Services.andP;  Using these tools, developers can createapplications that can exchange compound documents or share the text andimages needed to put one together.andM;SQL/Services implements the Structured Query Language to provide a consistentway to query and manipulate databases.andP;  CDD/Plus is a repository service thatsets a consistent way for applications to define data and access thosedefinitions.andP;  File Sharing Services, which lets users store and retrievefiles in a distributed, heterogeneous environment, include VMS Services forPCs, NFS for Ultrix, VMS/Ultrix Connection, and the All-In-1 file cabinet.andO;DECprint provides a critical office service: letting users print from anyworkstation to any printer without having to specify the format or printer.andM;POSIX provides an operating interface standard so applications can be easilyported from one platform to another.andP;  NAS also provides OSI's X.400electronic messaging and Electronic Document Interchange services.andM;Team EffortandM;Team Computing is Hewlett-Packard's energetic approach to distributedprocessing.andP;  It allows users to communicate over multivendor systems andaccess distributed data, all through a consistent user interface.andP;  Like DEC'sCDA, HP's Team Computing approach is standards-based, which is especially keyfor the high-end workgroups the company targets.andP;  According to HP, the TeamComputing strategy is aimed primarily towards engineering, technical, andscientific workgroups since these environments rely most heavily onheterogeneous hardware and applications.andM;The Team Computing products include Task Broker, Network Computing System(NCS), and NCS-based system administration applications.andP;  Users of the TeamComputing environment are provided with an X Windows-based interface, whichincludes the standard OSF/Motif look-and-feel.andP;  HP also emphasizes systemadministration of distributed networks, specifically security and backup.andM;The Task Broker finds the best workstation on the network for any given job.andO;Through an intelligent bidding process, the Task Broker discovers theworkstation best suited to a certain task.andP;  Applications taking advantage ofthe Task Broker need no modification and can be distributed over amultivendor network.andM;While the Task Broker sends entire tasks to a single workstation to optimizeprocessing, NCS lets developers design applications that can be processedsimultaneously by several machines.andP;  With NCS, users can parcel out severalmodules of an application to multiple computers for simultaneous processing.andO;Both the division of the task and reassembling of the results are transparentto the application's user.andP;  NCS has three components: a remote-procedure callfacility, a high-level compiler, and software tools to let the applicationsdecide at run-time which workstation is best suited to a task.andM;Security and backup are enough of a problem on networks with applicationsrunning in single machines.andP;  When data is spread over several workstations oreven several sites, backing up can be close to impossible.andP;  Systemadministration services include OmniBack and Passwd Etc.andM;OmniBack archives data distributed over a network to a central location.andP;  Italso provides network managers with a scheduling facility and generates audittrails.andM;Passwd Etc.andP;  manages user logins, passwords, and account information across amultivendor system.andP;  The security service maintains a single logical databaseacross the heterogeneous network, eliminating the possibility of conflictsthat arise when multiple copies of the same information are stored ondisparate systems.andM;Stacking Up a StandardandM;Sun Microsystems' Open Network Computing (ONC) is a modular, scalable set ofnetwork protocols and services which facilitate distributed computing overheterogeneous networks.andP;  The most celebrated component of Sun's ONC strategyis Network File System (NFS), which has become a de facto standard forsharing files across multivendor networks.andM;The ONC environment can be viewed as a stack of layers.andP;  At the top of thestack are NFS, Network Information Services (NIS), Network Lock Manager(NLM), and Remote Execution (REX).andP;  NFS permits users transparent access toremote file systems on the network and allows them to access remote files asthough they were local.andP;  NIS stores system information in several databasesfor linking host names, network addresses, users' names, and networks.andM;Security is provided by NLM, which allows system administrators to define andcontrol user access to data.andP;  NLM also provides file and record locking.andP;  REXexecutes user commands and programs on remote systems, providing access tocomputational resources that may not be available on the local machine.andM;Beneath the layer of distributed network services are Remote Procedure Call(RPC) and External Data Representation (XDR).andP;  RPCs facilitate the executionof procedures on remote systems.andP;  Sun has incorporated Netwise's (Boulder,Colo.)andP;  RPC Tool into its platform.andP;  XDR provides a system-independent methodof representing data.andP;  Applications that implement the XDR format canexchange information among themselves, regardless of the platforms theyreside on.andP;  Source code for much of Sun's ONC, including NFS, RPC, and XDR,resides in the public domain.andM;Finally, the Transport Layer Interface (TLI) makes RPC protocol-independent.andO;As with the layer between the RPC and the low-level transport, TLI includessupport for TCP/IP, OSI, and Novell's IPX.andP;  Application developers can writeRPCs without having to know what particular type of system they're designingfor.andM;ObstaclesandM;End users can't take advantage of distributed applications until softwaredevelopers provide them, and the developers won't provide distributedapplications until it's easy and profitable to do so.andP;  While tool kitscertainly simplify the actual development process, software developers needfinancial protection as well.andP;  Software companies need to be reimbursedfairly for the number of users actually accessing the application.andP;  Licensingservices may provide a solution.andM;&quot;One of the biggest problems in developing distributed applications iscontrolling the software license,&quot; says IDC's Villars.andP;  &quot;The application isresident in the network, so how do you do a license?&quot;andP;  Previously, onmainframes and minis, as well as PC LANs, licenses were always CPU-specific.andO;While the approach was fine for larger systems with single processors,distributed applications by nature access more than one processor.andP;  As aresult, software is beginning to be licensed per user, rather than per CPU.andM;The network licensing services built into most tool kits allow multiple usersto access a single copy of an application and also protect softwaredevelopers.andP;  The licensing service acts as a library, with users checking outcopies of the software, until the limit specified by the site license isreached.andM;Since these tool kits have only become mature in the last two years or so, anavalanche of off-the-shelf products hasn't occurred.andP;  While many third-partyvendors--such as Frame Technology (San Jose, Calif.) which uses Sun's ONCtoolkit in its development of desktop publishing software--have begun toinvestigate the potential of distributed processing, it will take severalyears to reach the point where a user can walk into Egghead Discount Softwareand buy a truly distributed application.andP;  HP shows a remarkable understandingof the market when it says Team Computing products are aimed at technicalworkgroups.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
