(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nineteen months after Gov. Buddy Roemerwent to war against populist tradition, he claims severalvictories, owns up to a major defeat and admits he needs to do abetter job dealing with legislators.   But Roemer, a self-styled reformer who unseated three-term Gov.Edwin Edwards in 1987, said he won't back off from a pledge against``good-old boy'' dealings. ``I don't want anybody to bedisappointed in the fact that Buddy has gotten a little older andhopefully a little wiser.   ``I can be legitimately criticized for many things ... but Idon't think you can say after a year and a half that this is apolitical office.''   Roemer's drive to enact an ambitious agenda have been metrecently with anger from legislators. His style _ part bulldog andpart evangelical minister _ worked against him during debates overthe state's tax system and a divisive budget-balancing fight thisyear, some lawmakers said.   ``He has had the attitude that it's his way or no way,'' saidRep. John Alario, who was ousted as House speaker last year atRoemer's insistence. ``He should know better. He came up as alegislator through Congress and he knows that's not the way itworks. For some reason, he let it go to his head and ran all overeveryone and that's not a way a democracy should work,''   When Roemer took office in March 1988, Louisiana faced anaccumulated deficit of $900 million and ranked near the top of theunemployment list and at the bottom of most education categories.He convinced the Legislature to give him temporary fiscal authorityunlike any since Huey Long, who ruled with fiat and a rubber-stampLegislature in the late 1920s and early 1930s.   In the first few months of Roemer's term, an education reformbill gave teachers pay raises, the state's long-term debt wasbonded out and the giant agency handling public welfare programswas split in half and reorganized.   An office of inspector general, headed by a former newspaperinvestigative newspaper reporter, was activated to root outcorruption and mismanagement.   The governor also pledged to bring in new business to endLouisiana's dependence on the volatile petroleum industry, and toclean up the environment _ goals often seen as conflicting. TheDepartment of Environmental Quality was beefed up and theLegislature this year passed a tough clean air act.   All the way, Roemer fought with the ``evil part of our past.''   ``I am a politician. I like politics. I don't consider it apejorative word. But in Louisiana it had become that over time.Excuses not to move, factions. It has not been surpising to me, butdepressing, to spend so much time on political warfare.''   The governor wound up on the losing side when he tried to changeLouisiana's populist tax system, which leaned heavily on businessand has often been described as ``don't tax you, don't tax me, taxthe guy behind the tree.''   One attempt to shift the load to individuals through income taxfailed in the Legislature in October 1988; a second passed in Marchonly to be rejected by voters in April. The fallout was anacrimonious fight with the Legislature over the current statebudget, a revolt led by his Senate floor leader that forcedacceptance of a sales tax to balance spending, and speculationRoemer already had moved into the ranks of the lame ducks.   ``Even the political enemies of that wanted it to pass. I'll sayit for the public record. They wanted it to pass because they knewit was the answer.''   The governor believes he has recovered from the downturn inpopularity as gauged by post-session media polls, but doesn't knowyet whether he will seek a second term. Edwards already has saidhe's thinking about another bid and other candidates from 1987 arebelieved to be looking at the 1991 race.   ``I need to do a lot of things,'' Roemer said. ``Fundamentalchanges are so important for this state to survive that if I feel ayear, a year and a half from now that to finish the job, I've gotto stay, then I'm going to ask the voters to keep me. But I neverwant to make that desire to be paramount in my mind and in theactions that take place here.''   Voters on Oct. 17 approved a major part of the tax package, a$1.4 billion highway improvement program funded by a 4-centincrease in gasoline taxes, but Roemer said it's too early todecide on a third attempt at fiscal revision.   Former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander ``called me and told methat it took the second year of his second term to get it done,''he said.   Meanwhile, Roemer said, he will concentrate on selling Louisianato new industry and spend less time in the step-by-step legislativeprocess. ``That's not what I do best, but I had to do it.   ``It's time to put that to rest for a while and let me begovernor. Let me represent this state, sell the state, move peoplein terms of the feelings about the state. I'm enjoying this part ofmy term.''   Roemer also is modifying his approach to dealing withlegislators. A former state representative, P.J. Mills, was broughtin as chief of staff and several members of the staff have departed_ voluntarily and involuntarily.   ``The more `we' I can put into this and the less `me' I can putinto this, the more better off we are,'' he said, adding that hisfuture dealings with the Legislature would be ``a little lessconfrontational. We don't have to win every fight, we don't evenhave to fight every fight.''   Alario is reserving judgment. ``What he says he's going to doand what he does often doesn't come out the same way.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Mon Nov. 13</NOTE></DOC>
