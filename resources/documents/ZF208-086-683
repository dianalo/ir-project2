Sun's offering was thetransport-independent portion of its remote procedure call, RPC XDR (externaldata representation), which it jointly developed with ATandamp;T for inclusion inUnix System V.4.andP;  RPC XDR works in conjunction with the Transport LayerInterface in Unix V.4, which according to Sun spokesman Dennis Freeman willenable TCP/IP, NetWare, and eventually Open Systems Interconnection protocolsto be implemented on distributed systems, with applications not needing toknow the transport mechanism used.andP;  RPC XDR is already used in Network FileSystem, currently licensed by around 280 vendors, and support from Novell,Banyan and 3Com opens up the world of personal computers.andP;  Sun is leavingaside its own higher level networking tools in favour of the RPC Toolcompiler from Netwise Inc - called by Sun's vice-president of distributedcomputing Larry Garlick &quot;the Adobe of distributed computing&quot; (he meansPostScript) - which being independent of both Sun and ATandamp;T should strengthenits case.-Although ATandamp;T and Unix International appear to be winning thebattle to establish the core standard Unix operating system, the rival OpenSoftware Foundation has already proved its abi lity to push companies intoworking together on some of the surroun ding technologies with the other OSFMotif user interface - and is now beginning the whole process again fordistributed computing.andP;  John Abbott reports -On the face of it, however, theApollo Network Computing System, which has for a long time been regarded as atechnically elegant solution for distributed computing despite its longgestation period, has major backing amongst the Open Software Foundation'ssponsors.andP;  Over the past year DEC, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dell Computer andothers have licensed the technology, and according to Computerworld,Microsoft Corp is now also planning to endorse the NCS remote procedure callto run over OS/2, AIX Version 3 and Hewlett-Packard's translation of the OS/2LAN Manager into C, known as LM/X.andP;  The paper says that IBM and Microsoft -both included in the Foundation list - have combined to submit extensions toNetwork Computing System that will enable this to happen.andP;  IBM also appearsto have submitted technology in conjunction with its long term communicationspartner Locus Computing, along with Hewlett-Packard and Pittsburg-basedTransarc Corp. Transarc recently announced that its AFS 3 version ofCarnegie-Mellon's Andrew File System will be available in March (CI No1,294).andP;  AFS 3.0 is a very scalable system, according to Transarc's directorof marketing Phil Lehman, who claimed that AFS could scale to thousands ofusers at large sites, but still improve productivity in workgroups with asmall number of computers.andP;  On AFS systems, such as the 10,000 user, 17 fileserver and 2,000 client machine system currently based around Carnegie MellonUniversity in Pittsburgh, users see a single large file system, and do notneed to worry about the location of files.andP;  Currently working on a translatorto provide interoperability between AFS and Network File System remote calls,Transarc could presumably do the same for Network Computing System if it waschosen as a portion of the Foundation's final product.andP;  Other submissions tothe Request included a separate entry from Banyan Systems, Westboro,Massachusetts, proposing its distributed naming system, providing a unifiednaming space for network resources.andP;  BBN Communications Corp of Cambridge,Massachusetts, couldn't be reached to explain its submission, but pioneeredInternet a decade ago, and has expertise in TCP/IP and network management.andO;But amongst the submissions from DEC, Hewlett, IBM, Locus, Microsoft,Netwise, Nixdorf, Retix, Siemens, Sun and Transarc were those from smaller,less known companies, including Architecture Projects Management, Bit31,Chemical Abstracts, Child Systems, Paris-based Chorus Systems, DatabaseEngines, Dialogue Switching, DEC, Dset Corp, Norcom, Research Triangle, TRW,Uniware and VXM.andP;  University submissions were received from Cornell, tworesearch projects (Mercury and Athena) from the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology, and from York University in the UK.andM;Sun or ApolloandM;Presentations by all participants are set for the five day membership meetingin Boston, from November 6 to 10.andP;  The Request evaluation team has beenestablished from permanent Foundation staff, sabbatical employees,consultants and analysts, and will make a final selection in the secondquarter of 1990, combining elements of the submissions to make a completeoffering.andP;  But unless the Foundation makes an unexpected and clean start, itlooks inevitable that, as the fundamental Procedure Calls for the Sun andApollo systems are incompatible, a choice of either one or the other has tobe made, whatever else is chosen for the higher levels.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
