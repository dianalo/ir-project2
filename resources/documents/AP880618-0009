COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Not everyone is complaining about the droughtbaking farmland and stranding river barges, say TV weatherforecasters, who say they're prepared to take the heat for any kindof weather.   ``No matter what you do, you can't win,'' said Andy Avalos ofWLS-TV in Chicago, who added that some people are enjoying thesunny weather and 90-degree temperatures accompanying the dry spell.   Avalos was among about 200 forecasters who converged Fridaymorning on a downtown hotel for the American MeteorologicalSociety's 18th Conference on Broadcast Meteorology.   Forecasters may sometimes have trouble predicting the weather,but they know they can expect scattered complaints under anyconditions.   ``Always, no matter what the weather is, there is someoneunhappy with it,'' said Gail Lynne of KLFY-TV in Lafayette, La., afive-year veteran of television forecasting.   ```It's too hot, too dry, too humid,''' she said, quotingcomplaints she has heard.   ``Most people get quite angry,'' said Avalos, a 12-year veteranof weather prediction.   ``They always blame the weatherman when the weatherman is wrong,of course,'' he added with a grin. ``And they always blame theweatherman when the weather is lousy. And you can't pleaseeverybody, regardless of what the forecast is, no matter howaccurate you are.''   The meeting featured three days of sessions ranging from``Numerical Probabilities in Weather Forecasting'' and``Four-Dimensional Rendering of Satellite Data'' to ``The Weatherand Politics: Who Wins Elections When the Weather Turns Bad?''   ``I don't think there's anything specifically on the programthat's drought-related,'' said Cheryll Jones of WAGA-TV and CableNews Network in Atlanta, where drought has necessitated waterrationing.   ``But I'm sure before the whole thing is over with, in some ofthe sessions, it will be mentioned and discussed,'' she said.``There's always a lot of information to be learned at a conferencelike this.''   Everybody wants to know when it's going to rain, said EricNefstead of WREX-TV in Rockford, who has been doing weather for 15years.   ``They ask you every day, `Well, what's new today? You know, isthere any hope?''' he said.   Added Ms. Jones, ``It's real frustrating this time of the year,when you have the ... spotty type of showers and thundershowers,and you can't promise everyone that they'll get one.   ``And when they do come, they're so sparse and they're soinsignificant that in terms of the overall water needs, it's a bigletdown,'' she said, speaking from her 10 years of forecastingexperience.</TEXT></DOC>
