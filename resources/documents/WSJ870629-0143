Ground water reeking of rotten eggs surrounds one terminus, and the subway route crosses two potentially active earthquake faults. The cost of the 18-mile project: about $250 million a mile, about three-fifths of which will come from Uncle Sam.    But it isn't the project's cost that most worries Ralph Stanley, the just-resigned head of the federal Urban Mass Transportation Association. It's that this summer the federal government will be required to approve the the final environmental-impact statement -- whatever it may say -- and then open the federal spigot.    UMTA is required to study alternatives to any federally funded transit project by preparing an environmental report. Alternatives are precisely what impatient L.A. officials don't want to study, so the area's congressmen inserted language in the new highway bill requiring that UMTA complete a final environmental-impact statement by August; then within 30 days must approve building the first subway leg. &quot;L.A.'s attitude was give us the cash and damn the torpedoes,&quot; says Mr. Stanley. Congress will vote soon on a new $150 million grant for the subway.    L.A. isn't the only city that doesn't want UMTA to scrutinize its transit pork barrel. Other cities with projects on the drawing board put enough pressure on Congress that UMTA's budget -- $19 billion over five years -- was passed in March without a single public hearing ever being held.    Federal support for urban mass transit has been a mess for over 20 years, spawning fiasco after fiasco and reducing the productivity of existing systems. In 1965, urban mass-transit systems paid 98% of their operating costs through passenger revenue. Today, fare receipts pay only 38%.    Federal funds also almost always go to support downtown-oriented transit lines, even though most growth is still in the suburbs. Prestige subway and light-rail projects also soak up money needed to keep bus services for the poor going. Miami and Detroit both cut back bus routes to pay for their &quot;People Movers.&quot; For the money it spent, Detroit could have bought a new car for every low-income family without one.    Ronald Kirby, transportation analyst for the Urban Institute, believes the lure of federal dollars has blinded local officials to railpolitik alternatives. One solution to L.A's rush-hour congestion would be to expand the city's bus network, which carries 1.5 million riders a day, including half of all downtown commuters. The first leg of the subway will haul only 50,000 passengers. Mr. Kirby says some cities have encouraged private commuter buses and minivans. And he suggests L.A. look at the downtown subway being built in Seattle -- for buses only. A successful experiment in Hong Kong used sophisticated sensors on cars that priced freeway travel by time of day and then sent a monthly bill to the owner.    But nothing appears likely to stop officials in Los Angeles and other cities from digging deeper. The bait of federal construction dollars and a highly visible jobs program is just too irresistible. &quot;Government here is obsessed with the subway,&quot; says Assemblyman Dennis Brown of Long Beach, Calif. &quot;It's become like the hunt for Moby Dick.&quot; But when L.A. officials finally reach the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, they won't be gazing at a great white whale. Instead it will be a great white elephant. </TEXT></DOC>
