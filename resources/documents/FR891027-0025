Notice 86-5 proposed, in part, an amendment topart 25 to specify that any public address (PA) system which is requiredfor use in air carrier or air taxi service must be powered by a sourcethat is: (1) Independent of engine and auxiliary power unit (APU) operation,the forward motion of the airplane, and all normal means used by the flightcrewfor power source disconnection; and (2) capable of powering the PA systemfor at least 10 minutes, including an aggregate time duration of at least5 minutes of announcements made by flight and cabin crewmembers. In determiningthis capability, all loads which may remain powered by the same sourcewhen all other power sources become inoperative would have to be considered.In addition, if the same source is required for emergency power for loadsessential to safety of flight or required during emergency conditions,it would also have to be capable of powering the added PA system load foran additional time duration that is appropriate or required for those essentialor emergency loads. The proposed rule provided that in all cases the PAsystem load would be considered as that which exists during its standbystate, except for an aggregate time duration of at least 5 minutes of announcements.Notice 86-5 also proposed to amend andSection; 25.1411(a)(2) to clarify thatthe PA system microphone accessibility requirement is applicable only whena PA system is required by this chapter. In addition, Notice 86-5 proposed an amendment to andSection; 121.318 whichwould incorporate the provisions of the proposed amendment to part 25 byreference and thereby require certain airplanes used in air carrier serviceto comply with the new standards of part 25 if they are manufactured ayear or more after the effective date of the amendment. Because andSection;135.149(d) incorporates the provisions of andSection; 121.318 by reference,the proposed new standards would be applicable to certain airplanes usedin air taxi service as well, if they are manufactured on or after the samedate. The proposed new andSection; 25.1423, in which the new standards would becontained, would allow innovation in providing an acceptable power source;however, as a matter of practicality, the normal airplane battery or anotherbattery would most likely be used. In regard to the new andSection; 25.1423, as proposed, the notice explainedthat: (1) The expression ``all normal means used by the flightcrew forpower source disconnection'' means all switches or like devices providedfor that purpose, including, but not necessarily limited to, the generator,APU, and battery switches; (2) the use of this expression does not establishany requirements pertaining to the disconnection or connection of loads,however accomplished; (3) the deactivation of circuit breakers is not consideredto be a normal means used for power source disconnection; and (4) the expression``standby state'' means that condition during which power for making announcementsis provided to the PA system but announcements are not being made. The notice further explained that: (1) Power dependent on engine or APUoperation would not be acceptable because the engines and APU would notbe operating on the ground during many emergency conditions; (2) powerdependent on the forward motion of the airplane, which might be providedby a ram air turbine, would not be acceptable because it would not be availableon the ground during either normal or emergency conditions; (3) the proposalwould not affect the capability of the flightcrew to disconnect the PAsystem by using its electrical switch or circuit breaker(s) either to clearelectrical faults and protect the airplane and occupants against smokeor fires in the PA system (or its wiring) or to conserve the PA system'spower source capacity for other loads powered by the same source that areessential to safety of flight or of higher priority during emergency conditions;and (4) the megaphones presently required by andSection; 121.309(f) couldnot serve as an adequate means of communication. Sections 121.318(b)(1)and 135.149(d), by reference, require the means of communication to beaccessible for immediate use from each of two flight crewmember stationsin the pilot compartment. As further explained in the notice, such useof the megaphones by the flightcrew is not considered feasible in viewof the high workload during emergency conditions, the directionality ofmegaphone output relative to the flightcrew's forward location and forward-facingposition, and the fact that the flight compartment door is normally locked.The notice expressly requested comments on the proposed time duration forannouncements of at least 5 minutes, and on the possible need for operationalprocedures or flight or cabin crew training to prevent undisciplined useof the PA system during emergency conditions which could result in a hazardous,premature depletion of its power source capacity. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments </ITAG>One commenter states that these proposed amendments should be consideredas part of a total package of proposals involving crashworthiness thatthe FAA has under study, which includes a proposal to require ``push-to-talk''switches for PA system handset microphones and a possible draft advisorycircular pertaining to PA system training and the use of megaphones. TheFAA disagrees. Because those other proposals are wholly or largely unrelatedto the PA system power source, there would be no significant cost advantagein complying with those proposed standards, should they be adopted, atthe same time. Furthermore, combining these proposed amendments with otherproposals currently under consideration would unduly delay the safety benefitsexpected to result from this proposal. Several commenters question whether or not the proposed amendments wouldactually result in an increase in emergency cabin evacuation safety. Onecommenter states that the FAA had provided no quantitative measure of safetyimprovement, based on demonstrated service experience showing that fatalitiesor injuries had occurred specifically because a required PA system wasnot operable during an emergency condition, and that the qualitative justification``lacks persuasiveness.'' In contrast, other commenters, including theNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), support the FAA's positionthat an operable PA system would provide a definite increase in safety.The FAA concurs that the available quantitative data are limited; however,none of the commenters provided convincing reasons as to why this increasein safety would not be realized. Several commenters state that the portable megaphones required by andSection;121.309(f) are the primary means for directing emergency evacuations inairplanes operated in air carrier service, and that the proposed amendmentsare, therefore, unnecessary. The FAA does not concur that megaphones arethe primary means for directing evacuations nor that, for reasons statedabove in the Background Section, they could serve as adequate means ofcommunication in the event the PA system is disabled. The FAA also notesthat portable megaphones may not even be aboard some airplanes operatedin air taxi service, because they are not required for those airplanes.Several commenters express a desire for this proposal to be applied retroactivelyto existing airplanes. Conversely, other commenters express their concernthat the adoption of the proposed amendments would lead to later proposalsto apply them retroactively. While a retroactive requirement would be beyondthe scope of Notice 86-5 and could not be considered at this time, it mustbe noted that the FAA did propose a retroactive requirement in Notice 81-1(46 FR 5487; January 19, 1981). That proposal was later withdrawn becausecomments showed that it would not be cost-effective. In the absence ofany recent information to the contrary, the FAA currently has no plansto again propose a retroactive requirement. Several commenters object to the proposed amendments, stating that theiradoption would result in a mixed fleet, with some airplanes having an independentPA system power source and some not, and that this would cause confusionamong flight and cabin crewmembers. They further state that such confusioncould cause a hazard if crewmembers were to assume that their announcementswould be heard by the passengers, in the mistaken belief that the airplanehad an independent power source when, in fact, it did not. The FAA doesnot concur that such confusion would occur. It is noted that operationwith a mixed fleet began around 1965 when a major manufacturer began providingbattery power capability to the PA systems in all its large transport airplanesin production at that time, and continued providing it in all such airplanesproduced later under amended or new type certificates. The FAA is not awarethat any problems occurred during or after the introduction of airplaneswith independent power sources for the PA systems. Several commenters state that if a battery required for emergency powerfor loads essential to safety of flight or required during emergency conditionswere also used as the PA system power source, then discipline must be ensuredover the use of the PA system by including appropriate information in thecrew operations manual and providing appropriate training to crewmembers.The FAA concurs that such information and training are necessary; however,each operator is required under andSection;andSection; 121.135(a)(1), 121.417,135.83(a)(2), and 135.331 to ensure that the crew operations manuals orchecklists do include necessary information on the PA system power source,and that flight and cabin crewmembers are adequately trained in emergencyprocedures. Furthermore, FAA personnel ensure that all affected air carrierand air taxi operators provide all the necessary crew information and training.In the situation where a battery required for emergency power for loadsessential to safety of flight or required during emergency conditions wouldalso be used as the PA system power source, one commenter states that thelikelihood that a larger battery capacity would be needed for certain airplaneswould be reduced by flight and cabin crew operational procedures and trainingon disciplined use of the PA system. The FAA concurs; however, the FAAestimates that the proposed amendment would result in a relatively smallincrease in battery ``energy'' depletion of approximately 3 ampere-hours.Therefore, the FAA considers that batteries of larger capacity would berequired for few, if any, airplanes. Several commenters state that if a battery required for emergency powerfor loads essential to safety of flight or required during emergency conditionswere also used as the PA system power source, the PA system should notbe required to remain operative after disconnecting the battery with itsswitch, because this design could result in partial or complete batterydischarge while the airplane is parked and possibly at other times. Accordingto the commenters, this would be a hazard in itself and would cause unnecessaryand expensive battery maintenance. Two commenters state that one possiblemeans to prevent such discharge, an additional switch connecting the PAsystem to the unswitched or ``hot'' battery bus, would increase systemcomplexity and therefore decrease reliability, and also add to crew workload.Another commenter states that there must be a means to disconnect powerfrom the PA system during emergency conditions such as electrically causedsmoke, but that the proposed rule does not ensure it. The FAA agrees withthese comments. After further consideration, the FAA has determined thatthe regulation should not require the PA system to have a higher priorityfor power than loads essential to safety of flight or other loads requiredduring emergency conditions, and that it should not, in effect, prohibitproviding the flightcrew with a ready means to disconnect the PA systemconcurrently with other loads after, or in anticipation of, the occurrenceof electrical faults or electrically caused smoke or fires. For these reasons,andSection; 25.1423, as adopted, specifies that a required PA system mustbe powerable, in flight or stopped on the ground, after the shutdown orfailure of all engines and auxiliary power units, or the disconnectionor failure of all power sources dependent on their continued operation.This language does not preclude loss of power to the PA system as a consequenceof disconnecting the battery with its switch. The final rule will not resultin unnecessary battery discharges and associated hazards, and will notincrease battery maintenance costs above present levels.One commenter states that the proposed new andSection; 25.1423 is ambiguousas to whether it would require automatic switching. Another commenter statesthat any switching required to connect the PA system to the independentpower source should be automatic, so as not to increase crew workload.The notice was very specific in stating that the proposed andSection; 25.1423would not establish any requirements pertaining to the disconnection orconnection of loads, however accomplished. Furthermore, although not statedin the notice, the proposed new andSection; 25.1423 was not intended to establishany requirements pertaining to the connection of power sources, such asby using emergency power switches. Because these comments go beyond thescope of the notice, they cannot be considered at this time. In addition,the FAA considers that the capability to restore power to the PA systemby a manual switching operation is a considerable improvement over havingno means at all to restore it. Furthermore, requiring automatic switchingfor the PA system would be inconsistent with other emergency operations,such as loadshedding, which are not required to be automatic. One commenter asks whether the amendments would apply only to airplanesthat are newly manufactured after the specified date, or if they wouldalso apply to earlier airplanes that are modified or remanufactured afterthat date to seat more than 19 passengers. Airplanes manufactured priorto the specified date and later modified to seat more than 19 passengerswould not have to comply, regardless of when they are modified. It mustbe noted, however, that airplanes manufactured after the specified datewith 19 or fewer passenger seats would have to comply if they are modifiedlater to seat more than 19 passengers. One commenter suggests that the language in andSection; 135.149(d), ``* ** a passenger seating configuration * * * of more than 19 * * *'' be changedto read identically to that in andSection; 121.318(a), ``* * * a passengerseating capacity of more than 19 * * *'' so as to base the requirementsfor air taxi operators, as well as for air carrier operators, on the capacityfor installing seats, rather than on the actual seating configuration asrequired by andSection; 135.149(d). The suggested change would have to bethe subject of future rulemaking because it goes beyond the scope of Notice86-5. One commenter states that certain language in the proposed amendment toandSection; 25.1411(a)(2) would differ from the corresponding language inthe proposed amendment to andSection; 121.318(b)(2). The commenter appearsto suggest that the language should be identical. Actually, there are minoreditorial differences which existed previously between those sections andare not part of the proposed amendments. Nevertheless, it has been broughtto the attention of the FAA that both sections are ambiguous in regardto the number of microphones required for adjacent exits. Since there hasbeen considerable confusion as to the number of microphones intended bythose sections, editorial changes have been made to each section to clarifythat one microphone may serve two adjacent exits. These are nonsubstantivechanges which place no additional burden on any person because they reflectthe actual intent and are consistent with past FAA interpretation of thetwo sections. In regard to the proposed compliance time of 1 year for newly manufacturedairplanes, one commenter states that additional time might be needed inorder for the Airlines Electronic Engineering Committee (AEEC) to revisePA system equipment characteristics. The FAA disagrees that complianceis dependent on such a revision because a large part of the present fleethas already been equipped with PA system installations that would complywith andSection; 25.1423 without benefit of the revision. Comments are divided on the proposed requirement for a time duration ofat least 10 minutes of PA system operation (which includes at least 5 minutesof announcements). In this regard, one commenter suggests that 30 minutesshould be required. The FAA considers that 10 minutes would be sufficientfor most emergency conditions. Additional duration would, in most cases,be provided inherently because the same source that provides emergencypower to instrument displays and other equipment essential to safety offlight during instrument meteorological conditions would also usually beused to power the PA system. Accepted design practice for compliance withandSection;andSection; 25.1333(b) and 25.1309(b) for these instruments andequipment would usually ensure at least 30 minutes of PA system power availability,including at least 5 minutes of announcements. In regard to the proposed requirement for a time duration of at least 5minutes of announcements made by flight and cabin crewmembers, two commentersstate that they do not consider this amount of time to be adequate. Sincethe two commenters did not provide compelling reasons as to why 5 minuteswould not be sufficient, the FAA concurs with the other commenters whobelieve that 5 minutes is sufficient. As noted above, the requirements of andSection; 121.318 are presently incorporatedby reference in andSection; 135.149. Since the time Notice 86-5 was prepared,it has come to the attention of the FAA that the practice of incorporatingcertain provisions of part 121 in part 135 by reference may cause confusion.In order to preclude any confusion in this regard, part 135 is amendedto include the requirements of andSection; 121.318 and related andSection;121.319 explicitly rather than by reference. This is a nonsubstantive editorialchange that places no additional burden on any person. Except as discussed above, the amendments are adopted as proposed in Notice86-5. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>This document summarizes the final cost-benefit assessment of a rule requiringan independent power source for the public address (PA) system in newlymanufactured transport category airplanes that are required to have suchsystems by existing operating rules. The objective of this rulemaking isto ensure that the PA system is available to initiate and direct emergencyevacuations and provide instructions to passengers during emergency conditions.In response to several public comments solicited by the FAA in the Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), the FAA has revised this final rule to ensurethat disconnection of the airplane battery with its switch would not precludeshutting off power to the PA system. This revision is intended to allowthe PA system to be shut off as the battery is disconnected with its switch,in order to prevent the possibility of battery discharges while the airplaneis parked. The revised rule also responds to concerns in several of thecomments about potential additional costs, by effectively eliminating theneed for additional maintenance checks and costs resulting from depletedbatteries. The FAA has updated the economic analysis of this rule from the analysisperformed for the NPRM issued in May 1986, based on new information anddata received since then. On the basis of the information that is currentlyavailable, the FAA concludes that this rule is cost-effective. Costs This amendment should have some cost impact on one of the two major U.S.manufacturers of transport category airplanes with more than 19 seats.The airplanes produced by the other manufacturer already meet the new standards.The other manufacturer will therefore not incur any additional costs. The manufacturer not currently in compliance had indicated that the mostcost-effective method of complying with this rule would be to change thetype design to locate the PA system circuit breaker at the battery bus.For the affected airplanes, the existing battery system would be sufficientto provide an independent power source for the PA system. After consultation with industry and other sources, the FAA has determinedthat approximately 400 design and engineering hours would be necessaryfor such a redesign. The FAA has adopted the conservative assumption thatall of the design and engineering costs will be incurred in the year afterthis rule is issued, rather than spread out over future years; design andengineering costs therefore are not discounted in this analysis. The estimateof required engineering time has been adjusted upward to 437 hours to accountfor leave and other absences. An appropriate rate for valuing engineering hours is $54.58 per hour, afteroverhead multipliers and fringe benefit factors have been applied to thecurrent average hourly salary figure for aerospace engineers. Total costfor design and engineering is therefore $23,850, incurred in the firstyear after issuance of this rule.The FAA estimates that the redesign of the circuit connecting the publicaddress system to the airplane's main battery would add at most $500 inwiring and additional equipment to the production cost of each airplane.Additional labor required for installation is expected to be negligible.The present value of the total cost of compliance with this regulationbetween 1988 and the year 2000 is expected to be $192,744, based on a 1987production forecast of the affected types of airplanes. Benefits There have been several accidents over the last two decades in which injuriesor fatalities may have resulted from a malfunction or disconnection ofthe public address system on U.S.-operated transport category airplanes.The National Transportation Safety Board recommended in 1974, 1979, and1981 that the FAA mandate an independent power source for the public addresssystem in such airplanes, stressing that the availability of the PA systemis vital for directing emergency evacuations and providing pre-impact instruction.The extent to which the safety of passengers would be enhanced by compliancewith this rule cannot be quantified. Nonetheless, the $192,744 total costof this regulation would be more than offset if as few as 16 minor injuries,each valued at $21,000, 7 serious injuries, each valued at $54,000, orone fatality, valued at $1 million, were prevented between the date ofenactment of this rule and the year 2000. Potential benefits, as well ascosts, have been discounted over time in this determination. It is reasonable to conclude that such a small number of injuries or fatalitiescould be prevented in a single accident, particularly if the circumstancesinvolve the possibility of fire on the ground. In such emergency situations,the ability of the flight and cabin crew to brief the passengers on emergencyprocedures just before and once the airplane has landed could well savelives and prevent injuries, if the time required for egress from the airplanewere consequently reduced. Trade Impact Assessment and Regulatory Flexibility Analysis This rule will have little or no impact on trade for both U.S. firms doingbusiness in foreign countries and foreign firms doing business in the U.S.Furthermore, this rulemaking is expected to cause no significant impacton small entities, since the manufacturer of the transport category airplanesaffected by this regulation is a large manufacturer according to the FAA'ssize threshold criterion. Federalism Implications The regulations adopted herein do not have substantial direct effects onthe states, on the relationship between the national government and thestates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. Thus, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that such a regulation does not have sufficientfederalism implications warranting the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>For the reasons discussed earlier in the preamble, the FAA has determinedthat this is not a major regulation as defined in Executive Order 12291.In addition, the amendment will have little or no impact on trade opportunitiesfor U.S. firms doing business overseas and foreign firms doing businessin the U.S. Since the amendment concerns a matter on which there is substantialpublic interest, the FAA has determined that this action is significantunder Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures.In addition, the FAA certifies that under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, this amendment will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities. A regulatoryevaluation of this action, including a Regulatory Flexibility Determinationand a Trade Impact Assessment, has been placed in the regulatory docket.A copy of this evaluation may be obtained by contacting the person identifiedunder ``<T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT.</T2>'' <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects: </ITAG>14 CFR Part 25 Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. 14 CFR Part 121 Air carriers, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airplanes, Aviation safety,Common carriers, Safety, Transportation. 14 CFR Part 135 Air carriers, Air taxi, Air transportation, Aircraft, Airplanes, Aviationsafety, Safety, Transportation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendments </ITAG>Accordingly, parts 25, 121 and 135 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(FAR), 14 CFR parts 25, 121, and 135, are amended as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 25_AIRWORTHINESS STANDARDS: TRANSPORT CATEGORY AIRPLANES </ITAG>1.
