 It has been feeding off the Atexcustomer base since its inception.andP;  Now, it feels it will have a better shotat landing some of the loyal Atex customers that haven't been tempted to talkto ATS in the past.andM;It was showing a send/receive capability of files, to and from an Atex systeminto its Work Station III product, which is a standard PC interfaced into theAtex system.andP;  In the past, ATS files had to be stored on the Atex side.andP;  Nowfiles from Atex can be stored directly on the disks of these PC workstations.andM;ATS is also porting the workstation functionality to a Mac.andP;  This productwill offer the same features as in the DOS environment but with the Mac userinterface.andM;Prodigy: injecting new life into a J11.andP;  The most interesting product shownby ATS was something called &quot;Prodigy.&quot;andP;  This is an interface card that plugsinto a standard PC (most likely a '386).andP;  The card enables the PC to beattached directly to the MultiProcessor Bus (assuming there is an unused MPB)slot of a standard Atex system.andP;  In effect, this makes the '386 look and actlike any of the J11 processors in the system.andM;This approach offers a great deal of flexibility when users want to expandtheir existing Atex systems--without fear of obsolescence.andP;  The PC, runningprograms such as XyWrite or Computerease's WordMover, can be networked toother PCs, and the additions could later form the basis of a new PC-basededitorial system.andM;Prodigy's throughput (using the '386 in place of an Atex J11) is the same asthat of any other device connected to the MPB.andP;  This could potentially offerbetter performance than even Atex's own methods of extending its system withPCs, which go through the serial port with significant performancedegradation (as opposed to ATS's method of direct MPB connections).andM;Prodigy will provide ATS with its own method of migrating Atex customers offof their current systems and onto more modern networked PC-based solutions.andO;It poses the most significant threat yet to Atex retaining its largeinstalled customer base.andM;ATS is currently evaluating a beta site to be installed shortly after ANPA.andM;ATS's service contract business for existing Atex system is also growing.andP;  Itcurrently has contracts to support 130 existing Atex CPU's nationwide.andM;Computerease offers Send/Fetch for MacandM;Computerease is also feeding off the Atex customer base.andP;  It can now send andreceive files between Atex systems and a Mac.andP;  This process is somewhatapplication independent, as long as the software being used to edit, composeor make up pages on the Mac system can read and produce pure ASCII files.andO;Called Send/Fetch, the program interfaces with the Atex system via a wireport using a conventional modem.andM;Operationally, Send/Fetch includes a communication program that opens up adialing window on the Mac.andP;  Once connected to the Atex, the user logs on thesame as from any Atex terminal.andP;  Users may request short directories (mediumand long directories to follow) and pull or push files to/from the Atexsystem--bringing them into an editing program on the Mac.andM;Information Engineering aids graphicsandM;Another company living off the Atex customer base is Information engineering.andO;Its main product, Editorial News Layout (formerly called PC News Layout), isan alternative to (or a replacement for) an Atex GT-68 page layout terminal.andO;It appears to be doing well, not only in the Atex market, but also ininterfacing to systems from other vendors.andM;The terminal was being shown with a few enhancements, such ascropping/sizing/rotating graphics.andP;  These instructions are in OPI format andcan be attached to files directed to a PostScript typesetter.andP;  Theinstructions made looking at the low-resolution viewfiles are then executedon the high-resolution graphics by the RIP as it builds pages.andP;  Also beingshown was Information Engineering's ability to perform SQL queries to remotedatabases.andM;Information Engineering also has an interface to Computerease's ad layoutprogram that it sells for less than $10,000.andM;Graphic Edge starts up.andP;  Sharing a booth with IEA was Graphic Edge--anothercompany partially funded by Doug Drane.andP;  Graphic Edge was showing theconversion of standard TIFF files into its own &quot;SAIL&quot; language, which itdescribes as a highly compressed and convenient language for use within asystem.andP;  Its software also creates a low-resolution TIFF file in theconversion process, which is available for applications that read andmanipulate TIFF files.andM;Since Graphics Edge uses its own proprietary format for dealing with graphicswithin a page makeup environment, output to PostScript printers is notexactly straightforward.andP;  Therefore it has come up with its own PostScript&quot;plus&quot; software.andP;  This takes standard PostScript and adds to it GraphicEdge's own screening algorithms for both black-and-white and color photos.andM;Beta testing of the Graphic Edge software will take place in about threemonths.andM;Xeta shows Gateway to AtexandM;Xeta, which was formed for the purpose of serving Atex customers, as its namesuggests, demonstrated its Printer's Devil Gateway, which links PC networkswith Atex systems.andP;  Its main function is to provide automated file transferand translation between PCs running on novell or Tops networks and the AtexPCI interface.andP;  Transmission occurs over 38.4K-baud serial lines between aGateway PC sitting on a network and the host system.andM;A variety of word processing programs running on the network can betranslated.andP;  Files created on PCs can be sent to worklisted queues on thehost and returned to the PC with line endings visible.andP;  Header information isretained as stories are transferred.andM;The Gateway is in use at Conde Nast in New York, a magazine publisher, where340 PCs are operating on multiple networks.andP;  One magazine is currently inproduction using the Gateway, with more scheduled to be added soon.andM;A Gateway system costs $30,000, including a 25-MHz AST '386 PC with 1 MB ofmemory and a 60-MB disk drive.andM;Handling stocks.andP;  Xeta also demonstrated its Xeta-Data PC+ stock settingsystem with some new enhancements.andP;  The system, which uses a PC to captureand typeset financial data from the Reuters and AP wire services, supportsdeleting fields, joining fields, building true fractions, adding headlinesand headers, etc.andM;A new feature is the ability to do field-by-field font changes, rather thanline by line, such as in highlighting local stocks on the most-active list.andO;Also new is access to 256-character fonts instead of 128, plus support for anunlimited number of fonts per file.andM;Xeta has added the ability to insert an island ad in the middle of data.andP;  Thesystem formats single-column stock files in multicolumn format.andM;Electronic LibrariesandM;The main new development in electronic libraries was the offering fromTribune Publishing Co. of Lewiston, Idaho, which uses the search engine fromFolio with a &quot;front-end&quot; capability designed for use with the Lewiston paper.andO;We'll go into more detail on this new line later.andM;DataTimes showed a new PC version of its Flash system, which can runstandalone or on a network.andM;Stauffer showed a 940-MB optical disc for its Stauffer Gold library.andO;Stauffer says it has installed 57 library systems to date.andM;Infosel demonstrated version 2.11 of its archival system, featuring up to 40user-definable fields, simultaneous updating of a set of documents (allrelated to a common topic) according to an established criterion, the abilityto send stories from the library to a fax machine, importing of PostScriptfiles to be indexed, and some interesting database management facilities.andO;Among the latter items are the ability to analyze the productivity of theindexer, security codes, network configurations and user monitoring.andM;Infosel, which has stopped selling hardware, has installed systems in 17countries, where they are running in four languages.andM;The newest items from Vu/Text were support for international character setsand the ability to transmit stories via fax.andP;  International language supportwas necessitated by the addition of two customers in Latin America this year,we were told.andM;The Vu/Text fax capability enables the operator to treat the fax modem justlike a printer.andP;  Stories from the library can be queued for transmission.andP;  Anice benefit of transmitting stories in this way, of course, is that theyaren't scanned by the fax machine, as normal fax transmissions are, so thequality on the receiving end is much higher--as if they were printed on alocal printer, not on a fax machine.andM;Tribune Publishing shows NewsViewandM;The Tribune Publishing Co., publisher of the Lewiston (ID) Tribune (circ.andO;25,000 daily), developed a full-text library system for its own use and hasbeen running it for about six months.andP;  It features the search engine createdby Folio, of Provo, Utah, and a librarian's module designed by Tribune.andO;Called NewsView, the system stores and accesses pictures as well as text.andO;The text database indexes every word, including articles and conjunctions.andM;NewsView runs on standard PC networks.andP;  It runs as a separate program from aneditorial system (the Tribune uses a Hastech HS 58 system), so a reportercannot open library files while a news story is on the screen.andP;  This is incontrast to the way Synaptic Electronic Publisher is implementing the Foliosearch engine tied in directly to its SunType editorial system.andM;The Librarian's Module.andP;  We had seen the search engine before, so we wereprimarily interested in the Librarian's Module, which is the facility forbringing stories into the database, checking the identification of elements(headlines, bylines, etc.), adding to the index words that don't appear inthe text stream, and doing the other things that a librarian may want to do.andM;Many of these tasks can be automated, but Tribune figures that someone willwant to check most stories for one thing or another, so it has put a lot ofeffort into simplifying that task.andM;This module runs within Microsoft Windows 3.0, for which Tribune was adeveloper.andP;  Functions can be accessed from the keyboard or with a mouse.andM;Stories being read in--a process that doesn't tie up the PC--can havecommands and control characters stripped.andP;  The Tribune says it may offerfilters to provide specific data conversions, but it hasn't done so yet.andM;After stories have been brought in, the librarian specifies the publicationand edition, the type of story, etc.andP;  NewsView supports the ANPA's 15categories, each of which is accompanied by a list of terms associated withthe category.andP;  It is possible to add any other terms that are desired.andM;The librarian can view listings of stories displaying a variety of kinds ofinformation--headlines, text, etc.--from which the full text can be calledup, successive stories accessed by keyboard commands, and so on.andM;The indexing process is fast, according to the figures Tribune gave us.andP;  Witha 20-MHZ '386 PC, 22 MB of information can be indexed per hour.andP;  It indexesevery word on the grounds that some of the words normally put on a &quot;stoplist&quot; could be useful on occasion.andP;  For example, GLenn Cruickshank remindedus, if you want to locate an article on the rock group The Who, it would bedifficult if those words weren't indexed.andP;  The decision to include all wordswas made easier by the speed of the indexing and search operations, Glennsaid.andM;Among the things the librarian supports is linking a correction publishedlater to the original story to which it relates so that the person accessingthe story also gets the correction, with a prominent flag at the beginningadvising of the correction.andP;  Also useful is the ability to store and indexunpublished articles with flags indicating that they were never published.andM;Photos and line art, in PCX format, can be stored with links to the articlesthey illustrate.andM;The search engine.andP;  The search engine, developed by Folio, is the same onethat Novell employs for its own use, so people with Novell networks mayalready be familiar with it.andP;  It provides a nice set of basic searcharguments (and/or/not, exclusive or, two wildcards, proximity searches tospecify &quot;next to&quot; or within a certain number of words, etc.) and is claimedto run quickly.andP;  The system at the show wasn't on a network, so its greatspeed wasn't necessarily representative of what it would be like in anewsroom environment.andM;The screen has a nice display of the results of a search operation.andP;  Theoperator can ask for a list of hits, which shows the headline, date and 40characters of text, displayed in order by time.andP;  Graphic items are precededby an icon.andP;  A graphic can be called up and, if it is larger than the screen,it can be scrolled.andP;  It is possible to go directly to any story by number orto move sequentially through the list.andM;The operator has a few options for printing the results of a search: theactive story, the active story plus the results of the search, or a blockfrom within a story.andP;  The query can be included in the printout.andM;Tribune says it is possible to create subset libraries for reporters to takewith them, but we didn't see this.andM;Hardware and pricing.andP;  NewsView requires '286 or '386 PCs with at least 640Kof RAM, a hard disk and at least an EGA-compatible monitor.andP;  To run theLibrarian's Module, Windows '286 or '386 is needed, as is aWindows-compatible network.andP;  To operate the search engine, the requirementsare less stringent--any PC-based network.andM;Tribune recommends the use of DOS 4.1 to support large disk drives.andM;A single-station license for NewsView costs $5,995.andP;  For an additionalLibrarian Module, the charge is $990.andP;  Additional Search Modules cost $99.andO;The network version costs $8,995 for a base license (which includes oneserver license and 10 Search stations), $590 for an additional Librarianstation, $290 for an additional search server license, $195 for 10 Searchstations, and $99 for a remote search station.andM;Support will be provided by the Tribune staff, with Folio available to helpwith the search engine.andM;The first order for a NewsView system was received at the show.andM;CommunicationsandM;Ricoh expands TelepressandM;Ricoh added a new product to its Telepress line.andP;  The new system is calledTelepress 25, and it differs from the Telepress 15 by offering a nominalcompression ratio of 15:1 (as opposed to 3:1 on the TP-15).andM;Also on display was a modified Graphic Enterprises plain-paper recorder.andO;This was set up to record at 1000 dpi in an 18&quot; X 24&quot; format.andP;  Its primaryuse will be as a tearsheet output device.andP;  The need arises as a result ofRicoh's new ability to merge and transmit a composite of a black sep of colorphoto pages, with the black text page.andP;  Both of these pages can be sent asone merged entity.andP;  But proofing the merged composite required a full-page,plain-paper proof--hence the modified Graphic Enterprises recorder.andM;Also shown for the first time was an online punching capability to registerpages recorded on a modified L-500 recording engine.andM;Tecsa focuses on using T1 linesandM;First seen at Drupa, Tecsa's Tecfax 2000 high-resolution facsimile appearedmuch the same at ANPA, but this time Tecsa emphasized the use of T1communication lines rather than 1SDN networks.andP;  We also saw the systemproducing output for the first time, at the adjoining Ultre stand.andP;  It lookedvery good apart from one or two minor aberrations, which Tecsa says that itknows about and is working to eradicate.andM;The system generated great interest by substantially reducing the cost offull-page facsimile transmission to remote sites using standard typesettersfor remote imaging.andP;  One reaction that Tecsa encountered was that prospectsexpected it to provide a total system, including communications, rather thanrely on a third-party source to provide the communications hardware.andP;  Thesystem that was being discussed used standard high-speed communications anddata compression hardware and software running in the PC.andM;MiscellaneousandM;AccuWeather goes from storms to soapsandM;AccuWeather introduced a telephone system and service called FeatureFone thatcovers not only its well-known weather information, but also news reports,sports scores, daily soap opera summaries, lottery results, business news,horoscopes, movie reviews, etc.andP;  This information is available to subscribersover voice phone lines.andM;It also can include talking classifieds, community news, restaurant guidesand other items of local interest.andP;  It can be used as an automatic pollingdevice, providing automatic tabulation and printing of results.andM;FeatureFone was designed to incorporate advertiser messages with eachincoming telephone inquiry, which is where a newspaper can profit.andM;Depending on the number of phone lines served, FeatureFone systems can beacquired for prices beginning at $9,990.andP;  They also can be leased.andP;  Theservice is scheduled to start on August 1.andM;Applied Learning tackles RSIandM;Applied Learning, which was returning to the ANPA show after a four-yearabsence, introduced a training program aimed at defending against carpaltunnel syndrome and other repetitive strain injuries (RSI) that afflictkeyboard operators.andP;  Called Magic Health for Professionals Who Use Keyboards,it offers a first line of defense against RSI, which causes disabling painanywhere from the fingertips to the shoulders and beyond.andM;RSI, which is often called the &quot;industrial disease of the information age,&quot;is projected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to account for half of alljob-related disorders during the 1990s.andM;With the publicity that has been generated by the recent multi-million-dollarlawsuit filed against Atex by disabled New York Newsday keyboarders, itshouldn't be difficult to impress management-level people of the need to beaware of this issue.andP;  And, in fact, Applied Learning's proprietor, JimBarrett, said he found the ANPA audience extremely receptive to hisideas--much more so than he had anticipated.andM;With RSI starting to attract well-deserved attention, the next area that maybe ripe for studies and action is that of other kinds of stresses around theworkplace that lead to physical ailments.andM;Jim also demonstrated ergonomically designed seating, including a new type ofelbow support.andM;CE offers support for 30% lessandM;A company called CE Engineering turned up to sell its support for systemsfrom Atex, System Integrators, Compugraphic and DEC.andP;  It introduced the CE1010 terminal that serves as a replacement for SII's ET/960 unit, featuring a14&quot; screen and detached keyboard with 16 function keys.andM;CE offers to provide service agreements for assorted systems and peripheralsfor 30% less than a user currently pays.andP;  We haven't been able to check outits performance, but the offer is interesting.andM;Microcrafts aids CG typesetter usersandM;Remeber the old Compugraphic One Systems line?andP;  Microcrafts brought asingle-terminal system to demonstrate its Translator II and III products,which enable old front-end systems that don't support PostScript orplain-paper proofers to drive PostScript printers.andP;  They can be used withmost systems that drive CG devices--UniSetters, VideoSetters, TrendSetters,8400s and 8600s.andP;  The user unplugs the CG typesetter and instead plugs in theTranslator, which then is connected to a printer.andM;The difference between the II and the III is that the latter unit enables theuser to insert graphics into a file created on a nongraphic front end.andP;  Thecallout for the graphic, which must be in EPSF format, is embedded in a fileat a One Systems (or other front-end) terminal, which causes the graphic tobe accessed and printed on output.andM;Microcrafts said it had installed 100 Translators by June of this year.andP;  Theyare in use with systems from: Data Star, Digital Technology, ECRM{ Hastech,Mycro-Tek, System Integratprs and Compugraphic (One System, Unified TerminalSystem and MiniDisk System).andM;Translator II costs $3,995 for older CG typesetters, $4,495 for the 8600 and$4,995 for the slave and semislave versions.andP;  Translator III costs $6,995 forolder machines, $7,495 for the 8600 and $7,995 for the slave unit.andP;  Otheravailable options include handamp;j, $500; multiple input, $1,000 for eachadditional one; serial ASCII input, $1,000; and training and installation,$500 plus expenses.andM;Publishing Technologies' Mac AdStarandM;Publishing Technologies introduced a Macintosh version of its AdStar program,which is designed for remote entry of ads and for transferring businessinformation directly into a business system.andP;  The program, which initiallysupported remote entry of classified ads and space reservations for displayads, has been expanded to transmit the contents of display ads in EPSFformat, with graphics in place.andM;Publishing Technologies set up two locations for the purpose of demonstratingits graphics transmission capabilities, using one to take a picture of avisitor to the booth, incorporate the picture in an ad, and transmit the adto the other location for printing.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
