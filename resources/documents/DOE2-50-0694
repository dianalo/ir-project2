Observations have been carried out on three levels.The first has examined the allocation of carbon at the crop or whole-plantlevel by observing the effects of SO{sub 2} and NO{sub 2} on dry-weightpartitioning in spring barley and winter wheat. There is a reductionin root growth before there is a decrease in the growth of the shoot,that plants are more prone to damage by air pollution in winter conditionsthen in those of summer, and that older varieties of winter wheat aremore susceptible to air pollution than modern ones. Carbon-14 was usedto trace the fate of labelled assimilate in winter wheat exposed to airpollution. The results suggested that when a source leaf is loaded with{sup 14}CO{sub 2}, less of the tracer is transported to the roots inthe polluted plants when compared to the control group. It was also evidentthat more of the carbon-14 was retained in the loaded leaves. Finally,carbon-14 and carbon-11 were used to investigate the effects of air pollutantson phloem loading and -transport.</TEXT></DOC>
