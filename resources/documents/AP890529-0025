But now the rebel commander is plying his own brand of politicsin Afghanistan, where shifting military fortunes sent theonce-Marxist government seeking support among groups it onceconsidered enemies.   Khalid joined the resistance at age 24, following firebrandrebel leader Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.   When the Soviet Red Army left Afghanistan, Khalid switched hisallegiance and pledged to intercede with other guerrilla commandersto help try to stop the jihad, or holy war.   He says it is no longer justified since the government, oncehostile to Moslem tenets, is now an active backer of the faith.   ``This cannot be called jihad. This is not according to Islam,to continue war and bloodshed,'' says the bearded Khalid, dressedin a turban and robe. ``We are all brothers. We belong toAfghanistan.''   With the Afghan armed forces left to fight alone, the governmentof President Najib has come under intensive military pressure, withguerrillas encircling the eastern city of Jalalabad and fightingaround the southern towns of Kandahar and Khost.   Thousands of reservists have been called for military duty andshipments of Soviet arms and ammunition stepped up. The UnitedStates, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and China are arming and trainingthe guerrillas.   Political and military analysts say they believe the governmentforces will be able to hold the cities against the divided,ill-prepared guerrillas. However, they add, there is littleprospect for the government winning the war.   Najib is trying to create a new political image aimed atstrengthening his government's support at home. That policy took ona new urgency with the final departure of the Soviet troops on Feb.15.   On May 21, Najib launched a new drive to try to end the11-year-old war, offering deals to a dozen guerrilla commanders,including three of the best known and most organized commanders _Ahmed Shah Masood, Ismail Khan and Abdul Haq.   The 43-year-old president offered them full military rank withinthe Afghan army, said they could keep their weapons and promisedautonomy in the regions they control. But his offer was rejectedwithin 24 hours.   ``They made a big mistake,'' said Khalid, who had come to Kabulto attend a meeting of the Loya Jirgah, the centuries-old tribalcouncil in Afghanistan, where Najib made the offer. ``I hope theywill reconsider. I do not want to see our country being cut intopieces.''   Diplomats and government officials say the government has hadsome success in opening secret talks with the guerrillas since theSoviet departure. At least one commander is known to have madecontact with the government and one Pakistan-based guerrilla leaderis reported to have been talking with the government for severalmonths.   But most commanders, while holding back on launching a majoroffensive, appear to be content to wait and see if an outrightmilitary victory by either side is possible, they say.   Although the government has had some scattered success, manyAfghans seem unwilling to forgive it for the hardships andsuffering brought by a war that has claimed at least 1.3 millionlives and forced more than 5 million others to seek refuge in Iranand Pakistan.   The groups whose backing are now being sought were among thefirst casualities when civil war broke out after Marxists seizedpower in an April 1978 coup.   The government is now undertaking a major effort to do away withsome of the policies that once trampled on Moslem tenets.   For some Afghans the changes have been cosmetic because the realpower still remains with the Politburo and the promise of newfreedom has been tempered by the continued activites of the KHAD _the Soviet-style secret police.   But the guerrillas and their supporters say they are unwillingto seek reconciliation as long as Najib and his People's DemocraticParty of Afghanistan cling to office.   ``All sides need to openly ask questions about what they aredoing and why,'' said Khalid. ``But they don't seem to know what todo. There are too many arms and too much money, and there will be alot more bloodshed. And the end result could be a disaster.''</TEXT></DOC>
