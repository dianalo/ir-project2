Secures Financing To Convert Plant </HL><SO> </SO><CO> CMS PEL DOW </CO><IN> UTI NUK </IN><DATELINE> JACKSON, Mich.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   CMS Energy Corp. said it completed $650 million in financing for construction of a previously announced cogeneration plant in Midland, Mich., and signed definitive agreements with joint venture partners for the project.    CMS Energy, the parent of Consumers Power Co., Michigan's largest utility, said the $650 million loan was made to the Midland Cogeneration Venture Limited Partnership by First National Bank of Chicago and three co-managers: Swiss Bank Corp., Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. and Bank of Montreal.    The partnership, in a controversial project, is converting CMS Energy's mothballed, $4.2 billion Midland nuclear power plant to a gas-fired, cogeneration facility. The nuclear plant, hobbled by construction errors and huge cost overruns, was never completed. CMS Energy still faces the possibility of substantial write-offs of its investment in the plant. In 1985, the company wrote off about $500 million of the plant.    CMS Energy also said it completed final agreements for the equity contributions of its partners in the venture, though the general composition of the partnership has been public for several months. CMS Energy will own 49% of Midland Cogeneration, Panhandle Eastern Corp. will own 17%, and Dow Chemical Co. will own 10%. The remaining stake will be split between several companies, all of them suppliers.    New capital invested in the project is $600 million, plus $275 million in interest costs, for a total of $875 million. CMS Energy hadn't previously disclosed its expectation of interest costs.    CMS Energy is shifting to the partnership $1.5 billion in assets already at the site. In return, it will receive its stake and interest-bearing notes totaling $1.27 billion with varying maturity dates.    The partners in the venture will contribute $740 million in equity to the project. A portion of that investment will be made up front, with the remainder being used when the plant goes into operation and to pay off a substantial portion of the bank loan.    Construction of the new plant has already begun.    In trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, CMS Energy closed at $19.875 a share, up 50 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
