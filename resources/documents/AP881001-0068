The leaders face opposition from hardliners who fear that endingIran's self-imposed isolation as it struggles to rebuild aftereight years of war will undermine the Islamic revolution.   ``Iran is now at a crossroads,'' one Western analyst commented.``It must either become more inward-looking or start lookingoutward.   ``The signs right now are that those advocating more opennesshold sway. But the next few months will be crucial either way.''   Parliament Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani and Foreign Minister AliAkbar Velayati launched Iran's bridge-building campaign a year ago,six months before Tehran accepted a United Nations-sponsoredcease-fire July 18 after a string of disastrous defeats.   The Iranians fought the war virtually without allies, while Iraqhad the Soviet Union, France and most of the Arab world behind it.   Rafsanjani and his supporters realized that Iran's ``No West, NoEast'' strategy was counterproductive.   He declared Aug. 21: ``Our postwar foreign policy will be moreopen than our policy during the war. We must take this opportunityto explain our aims and talk with the people of the world.''   Reining in Iran's unruly Lebanese surrogates, the fundamentalistHezbollah, or Party of God, and other Iranian-backed terroristfactions is a key component of his strategy.   He underlined that in a recent Tehran Radio broadcast in whichhe stressed that Iran now ``is not thinking of exporting ourrevolution through direct intervention or by force. The policy offorce is not a successful policy.''   Groups linked to Hezbollah, the spearhead of the Islamicrevolution in Lebanon, are believed to hold most of the 17foreigners, nine of them Americans, still missing in Lebanon.   The longest held hostage, an American, is Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Rafsanjani, considered the most powerful figure in Iran afterAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, has told Britain that Iran will helpfree British nationals held in Lebanon, including Church of Englandenvoy Terry Waite, in return for normalizing relations.   On Friday, Britain announced it would resume full relations withIran, frozen last year after an Iranian diplomat was arrested forshoplifting and a British diplomat was kidnapped and beaten inTehran.   The Iranians have ranked Britain second only to the UnitedStates as its main enemy in the West.   Earlier last week, it was announced that Kuwait and Iran wererestoring full diplomatic relations.   For West Germany, the links it maintained with Iran throughoutthe war have already paid off.   Three Germans kidnapped in Lebanon by Iranian-backed ShiiteMoslem extremists were freed after Tehran intervened. The lastFrench hostages were released in June, and France restored ties toIran.   Iran also has restored relations with Canada and is improvingties with Australia, New Zealand and the Soviet bloc.   Bringing Hezbollah's wild men to heel will be no easy task.Diplomatic sources reported that Rafsanjani was bitterly angry whenLebanese militants hijacked a Kuwaiti airliner in April anddemanded the release of 17 comrades jailed in Kuwait for bombings.   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, one of the militant groupsin Lebanon, has warned that speculation about imminent releases is``a mirage.'' But Rafsanjani's moves have raised hopes that othercaptives will be freed.   In recent weeks, government ministers and industrialists from ascore of countries, including West Germany, China, Denmark, Sweden,Japan and South Korea, have visted Tehran.   Many were lured by the prospect of lucrative contracts forreconstruction projects on which some analysts estimate Iran willhave to spend at least $40 billion.   Rafsanjani, who was involved in the secret arms-for-hostagesdeal with the United States in 1985-86, is seen by many in the Westas the most pragmatic of the Tehran hierarchy who would like toreopen a dialogue with the United States at some point.   But it is unlikely that relations will be restored soon with theUnited States, long reviled as ``the Great Satan.''   Prime Minister Hussein Musavi, who leads the hardliners opposingIran's open-door policy, declared Sept. 2 that speculation about aU.S.-Iranian rapprochement was ``nothing but illusions.''   He stressed: ``Considering the United States' acts against Iran,the resumption of relations with Washington would be a betrayal ofthe ideals of the revolution and those who have made sacrifices forit.''   And on Friday, U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz said anyU.S. settlement with Iran required an end to the Iran-Iraq war, anend to terrorism and the release of hostages.   ``There is no change in the situation as far as the UnitedStates and Iran is concerned,'' he said.</TEXT><TEXT>   Ed Blanche is the news editor for The Associated Press in theMiddle East, based in Nicosia</TEXT></DOC>
