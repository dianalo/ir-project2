That task, he said Tuesday, belonged to the North AtlanticTreaty Organization.   Mitterrand said, however, that a French president could realizeFrance's vital interests were affected by events beyond its bordersand, for example, come to the aid of its neighbor West Germany inan emergency.   Other points Mitterrand made in a major policy speech to theInstitute of Higher Defense Studies:   _France's new mobile short-range Hades nuclear missiles shouldnot become theatre or battlefield weapons, but serve as a finalwarning to an enemy that a nuclear confrontation was starting.   _France would continue to modernize its mainly submarine-basednuclear deterrent, but would also update a missile complex insouthern France.   _France retains the capability of building a neutron bomb at anymoment.   _France will not join any negotiations on reducing strategicnuclear weapons until deep cuts were made in the arsenals of bothsuperpowers.   _France opposes deployment of weapons in space as envisaged inthe Reagan Administration's Strategic Defense Initiative.   _France will keep its chemical weapons capability until aninternational ban on their manufacture and use is negotiated.   Mitterrand said the main objective of French defense policy wasto ``maintain our identity, our independence,'' which is why ``wehave our own strategy of nuclear deterrence.''   He said France was committed to achieving nuclear disarmamentand hailed the U.S.-Soviet accord to ban intermediate-range nuclearweapons as one of the major events since the end of World War II.   He said France will remain a reliable member of the Westernalliance without ``abandoning its autonomy of decision'' withregard to NATO's integrated military command structure.   Gen. Charles de Gaullle took France out of this structure in1966.   Mitterrand said in the event of war, France ``will be presentfrom the first minute with all its forces, including nuclear ones,provided that this was within the framework of the alliance.''   He remarked that Europe's common defensive capabilities could bestrengthened in 1993 after the European Economic Communityestablished a single market.   Mitterrand warned any attack against France's land-basedmissiles would mean ``we were at war and the unleashing of ourstrategic weapons would be instantaneous.''   The president said with regard to France's short-range nuclearweapons, such as the Pluton or Hades missiles, that these weaponswould be used only against military targets.   The Hades, to be deployed in eastern France by 1992, has a rangeof about 280 miles, barely enough to reach targets in East Germanyor other Warsaw Pact countries.   Newspaper reports last month, denied by Mitterrand aides, saidFrance was considering delaying or canceling the Hades program.</TEXT></DOC>
