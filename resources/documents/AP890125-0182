Afterward, the independent group indicated support for OPEC'sattempt to limit production and stated both producer and consumernations would be served by stabilizing prices.   A senior OPEC source said separately that he was hopeful thecartel could reach agreement for output cuts by the independentproducers, but said that wasn't likely to happen immediately.   ``Our unity is stronger now. Prices have strengthened and we areready'' for a cooperative agreement, said the senior OPEC source,who requested anonymity.   ``This is the first step in a step-by-step move'' to push up oilprices, he said.   A similar joint meeting was held last April, when six non-OPECproducers met with representatives of the 13-member Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries and suggested they jointly cut theirexports by 5 percent. OPEC rejected that proposal.   This time, some of the seven attending non-OPEC producers mightoffer to cut their collective production by 5 percent, withoutasking for reciprocal cuts from OPEC, non-OPEC sources have saidthis week.   The independents likely will want OPEC reassurance that thecartel would not increase its own production if they went ahead withtheir cuts.   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely-tradedinternational crude oil, was $16.55 a barrel late Wednesday inLondon, up 54 cents from late Tuesday.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for WestTexas Intermediate jumped 58 cents Wednesday to settle at $18.12 abarrel, after closing 21 cents higher on Tuesday.   OPEC experts from Algeria, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Indonesia,Venezuela and Nigeria met for several hours Wednesday at theIndonesian Embassy.   At a brief news conference after the meeting, OPEC directorgeneral Subroto described the gathering as a preparatory meeting ofcartel technicians.   He said technicians for OPEC and the non-OPEC nations would meetThursday morning to exchange information ``and we will see themarket together and then what we can do together.''   The groups planned to issue a joint statement afterward, Subrotosaid.   The non-OPEC group issued a communique afterward saying thatrepresentatives of Angola, China, Colombia, Egypt, Malaysia, Mexico,and Oman met with observers from the Soviet Union, Norway, the YemenArab Republic and the Canadian province of Alberta and the U.S.states of Alaska and Texas.   ``The delegates unanimously share the desire to see the oilmarket stabilize, an issue they consider of importance to bothconsumers and producers of oil,'' the communique read. ``This sharedresponsibility was perceived in spite of the variety of outlooksrepresented at the meeting.''   ``The delegates were satisfied that the OPEC conference held inVienna last November had produced very positive results and theyexpressed the hope that those efforts would be sustained throughoutthe first half of 1989,'' the communique read.</TEXT></DOC>
