 If this is still your diea of doing research, you'venever used a database published on CD-ROM.andM;Using technology adapted from CD audio technology, CD-ROMs let you do inminutes research that once took hours.andP;  A CD-ROM disk's small size and highcapacity--up to 660MB--make the large databases contained on read-onlycompact disks very convenient to transport and update.andP;  And for a network,there are added benefits--simultaneous access to one or more CD-ROM-baseddatabases, for example.andP;  Overall, there are few applications consideredimportant enough by themselves to justify the installation of a LAN, but formany network managers, CD-ROM is one of them.andM;But therein lies a problem: CD-ROM devices and libraries for PCs which hitthe market in early 1986, typically are marketed and subsequently licensed assingle-user systems.andP;  The idea is to put the CD-ROM drive on one PC and letone person use it at a time.andP;  This system is short-sighted, expensive, and apretty inefficient use of a magnificent resource.andP;  The best way to use aCD-ROM is to put it on a network so that everyone can access it with economyand efficiency.andM;Some vendors have already begun to license their CD-ROM disks for networkuse.andP;  And the six products reviewed here--from Advanced Graphic Applications,Artisoft, CBIS, Fresh Technology Group, Hewlett-Packard Co., and OnlineComputer Systems--let your network reap the benefits of that liberty.andM;LIST OF TITLES GROWSandM;Get in touch with the Bureau of Electronic Publishing in Upper Montclair, NewJersey ((201) 857-4300), for a catalog featureing many of the approximately250 CD-ROM database products currently available.andM;For the general market, you'll find The NewElectronic Encyclopedia fromGrolier Electronic Publishing and Microsoft Bookshelf (see &quot;Archives inMiniature,&quot; PC Magazine, January 31, 1989).andP;  For the computer market, you'llfind selections like Microsoft Programmer's Library and Ziff CommunicationsCo.'s Computer Library; for general business, there's Microsoft Stat Pak andSmall Business Consultant.andP;  Other databases available include the Physician'sDesk Reference from Medical Economic, Lotus Development Corp.'s One Sourceproduct family, and NEC Home Electronics' image libraries, Clip Art 3-D andImage Folio.andM;A typical CD-ROM database package comes with database and retrieval softwareon the CD-ROM disk.andP;  The retrieval programs vary in their sophistication, butmost allow database searches by keywords combined with and/or/not logicalconditions.andP;  This method helps your PC do a selective word search on anentire year's worth of computer-oriented publications or an entireencyclopedia within seconds.andM;The retrieval packages typically allow you to print our selections from thedatabase or capture the information in a separate ASCII file.andP;  Since CD-ROMdevices are read-only, the database retrieval software does not needsophisticated byterange-locking capabilities to protect the database fromcurruption while operating on a multiuser system.andM;THE LICENSING HITCHandM;The problem with loading application programs on a file server and sharingthem with other users often isn't technical so much as legal.andP;  Many softwarecompanies still haven't determined how to price, distribute, or supportmultiuser versions of their software.andM;The legal problems loom much larger with CD-ROM databases.andP;  Unwilling to takethe risk of compromising their profit margins, some companies have chosen notto allow legal multiuser access.andP;  Others have considered the idea and thenstuck their heads in the sand, hoping the problem would go away.andP;  Even thosefew companies that believe networking their databases to be a good idea arein a quandary as to how to price and license the multiuser versions.andM;The companies' reasoning deserves a close look.andP;  Publishers of CD-ROMdatabases tend to think of their products as reference books.andP;  One person ata time typically uses a reference book; if you want more copies, you pay thegoing rate.andP;  According to this line of thought, providing multiplesimultaneous access to the same data is similar to making photocopies of atextbook--illegal and unfair.andM;Managers of computer systems, however, are used to getting a license formultiuser applications at discounted prices.andP;  Having to pay full retail pricefor each additional user also seems unfair.andM;Some publishers, like Microsoft, expect those using its databases to followthe honor system and report the number of people who access a CD-ROM disk atone time.andP;  The company charges an additional $65 per node formultiple-workstation access in addition to the base price of each disk.andM;Microsoft also offers Academic Editions of its CD-ROM publications toaccredited schools.andP;  Microsoft Programmer's Library, for example, sells for$395 in the single-user version.andP;  If you want to provide five people withaccess to Programmer's Library, however, you pay $395 for the Programmer'sLibrary and $260 for four additional access slicenses (at $65 each).andO;Microsoft makes a 32-user Academic Edition of Programmer's Library availableto qualified institutions for $1,095.andP;  The 32-user Academic Edition ofMicrosoft Bookshelf, normally $295 per node, sells for $895.andM;Ziff Communications, the publisher of Computer Library, provides workgroupswith two different licensing options.andP;  In addition to the $695-per-yearsubscription price, a fixed-station license costs $120 per year and allows aspecific computer to access the database.andP;  This approach helps organizationsthat want to provide access to Computer Library to many different users inone particular location, such as a corporate library or information center.andO;A single-user license costs $75 per year above the subscription price andallows an individual to access the database from any computer on the LAN;this includes dial-in remote access.andM;Still another option is offered by Online Computer Systems, the maker ofOptiNet.andP;  Online offers a network edition of Grolier's New ElectronicEncyclopedia that allows simultaneous access to a prespecified number ofpeople.andP;  The Opti-Net software monitors the number of people using the data,and once you hit the limit, it refuses access until someone exits theapplication.andM;A spokesperson for McGraw-Hill Book Co., the publisher of the CD-ROM Scienceand Technical Reference Set, said it has no legal arrangement for multiuseraccess.andP;  The company, in other words, does not permit more than oneworkstation to access its CD-ROM database at a time.andM;The bottom line?andP;  You can't assume that there's a legal way to providemultiuser access to a database published on CD-ROM.andP;  It's logical, and it'stechnically possible, but that doesn't necessarily make it legal.andM;CD-ROM EXTENSIONSandM;Once you've overcome the legal hurdles, the going often gets easier, althoughearly pioneers in single-user CD-ROM--let alone the networked variety--had toovercome limitations that kept DOS itself from recognizing a CD-ROM drive.andO;Some limitations are still being addressed.andM;DOS, after all, knows nothing about any storage device larger than 32MB.andP;  Anda CD-ROM can store massive amounts of data--up to 660MB of information, withmost commercially available databases ranging from 400MB to 550MB in size.andO;Clearly, CD-ROM engineers had to modify DOS to allow it to handle largervolumes.andM;The answer came from Microsoft in the form of a piece of software known asthe Microsoft MS-DOS CD-ROM extensions, or MSCDEX.andP;  Most companies that sellcontroller cards for CD-ROM drives also license and distribute theseextensions.andM;In addition, MS-DOS, Version 3.1 and later, offers a built-in networkfunction.andP;  Despite MSCDEX, if you try to do a CHKDSK of a CD-ROM driveconnected to a standalone PC, you'll receive the reply &quot;Cannot CHKDSK aNetwork drive&quot; despite your standalone status.andP;  DOS returns this errormessage because, to the operating system, the CD-ROM drive on a standalone PClooks like a network drive.andP;  For this reason, normal networking softwarecan't make it available to the network without intervening software.andM;MSCDEX and DOS's network function work together when the CD-ROM driveactually is part of a network.andP;  When an application program requests datacontained on what is recognized as a network drive, the request comes to thenetwork redirector software, either directly or via DOS.andP;  The redirector thensends the request over the network to the appropriate server.andM;MSCDEX assigns drive letters to the CD-ROM devices, translates between thedisk storage format DOS expects to see and the CD-ROM disk, and controls thedrive.andP;  If a company doesn't use the Microsoft CD-ROM extensions, it mustprovide its own software to do the same job.andM;Another complexity unaddressed by the Microsoft CD-ROM extensions arises fromthe way CD-ROM database retrieval software employs temporary files.andP;  BecauseCD-ROM systems are slow, retrieval programs use temporary files to store datagleaned from recent searches and database index files.andM;But the authors of these retrieval programs did not uniformly considermultiuser access; consequently, these applications create temporary fileswith the same name each time the program runs.andP;  When you load these programson a network, you must create a separate subdirectory for each workstationthat's running a copy of the retrieval software.andP;  Each person must run thissoftware from a separate subdirectory or local disk drive, which provides aplace to write each user's temporary files.andM;You must also decide if users will get faster service by putting thetemporary files on the file server or on their own local hard disk drive.andO;all of these factors can significantly complicate the installation andmaintenance of CD-ROM systems on a network.andM;CONFIGURING HARDWAREandM;Whether you want to install a CD-ROM drive on an existing network or installa network that will include CD-ROM data-sharing capability, you'll be facingcertain decisions about the hardware configuration you plan to use.andP;  Here aresome of your considerations.andM;First of all, a networked CD-ROM system must include a CD-ROM drivecontroller card, the CD-ROM drive or drives themselves, and a complete PCspecially configured--and sometimes dedicated--for use as a CD-ROM server.andM;Aside from the network interface card, the only piece of hardware that youadd inside the PC acting as a network CD-ROM server is a CD-ROM drivecontroller card.andP;  Some manufacturers offer controllers that use a proprietarycable and signaling scheme between the drive and the controller.andP;  The benefitof the proprietary controller is that it optimizes the flow of data from thedrive to the RAM.andM;Others, however, offer controllers using Small Computer System Interface(SCSI) connections.andP;  Almost all of these schemes use a daisy chain for thedata bus, so adding drives is usually just a matter of chaining them in withone more piece of cable.andP;  In fact, the architecture of the SCSI adaptersallows you to use any drive with connections that meet the SCSI standard.andP;  Intheory, you can also daisy-chain other SCSI-compatible devices, like harddisk drives or tape backup units, to the one SCSI controller card.andP;  Inpractic, however, you won't be likely to do this because you'd need speciallyconfigured driver software, but it is possible to use this ability to helpslot-starved PCs.andM;If you use a proprietary controller, you'll have to take whatever kind ofdrive the manufacturer offers with it.andP;  Hewlett-Packard, for example, marketsits own controller and a drive manufactured by LMSI-Philips.andP;  This unit lookslike a 5.25-inch, half-height hard disk and fits into the same mounting slotsor rails used for a hard disk.andP;  It draws less than 1 amp of 5-volt and12-volt power from the host PC.andM;Sony CD players are widely used in the audio industry, so it isn't surprisingthat many of them turn up in data service, as well.andP;  They are typicallypackaged in their own low-profile cabinet with a power supply, fan, and datacables.andP;  There are several models of the Sony cabinet-mounted drivesavailable; some use Sony's proprietary cabling system, some use SCSI cabling,and some use both.andP;  To complicate things further, some models also sport anaudio interface--so when you aren't using them for data, you can loadcontrolling software into the PC and use these drives to play audio disks.andM;But regardless of the kind of interface used to connect a CD-ROM drive to aPC, it takes a long time to retrieve the data.andP;  The access times for CD-ROMdrives--the time needed for the electromechanical arm to move to the correctarea and read the data--are slow compared with hard disks.andP;  The drives on themarket today, after all, merely use an adaptation of the drive mechanismsused in CD audio players.andP;  For audio, providing fast access to the data onthe disk was never a design consideration.andM;Most CD-ROM drives have access times ranging from 400 millseconds to 800 ms.;andO;in comparison, the old IBM PC-XT floppy disk drives have an access time of500 ms.andP;  The fastest CD-ROM drive we found listed is made by Denon and has arated access time of 300 ms.; the Toshiba drives used in CBIS's CD Server arerated at 400 ms.andP;  (Today, hard disks have access times in the 11- to 85-ms.andO;range.)andM;If the response time of today's CD-ROM hardware is too slow for yourapplications, there are two ways to speed up the operation.andP;  Both, however,involve an additional investment.andP;  First, you can add many megabytes ofmemory to the CD-ROM server for use as a cache memory.andP;  While this doesn'tquicken the first database inquiry, on subsequent queries the retrieval speedcan be very fast if the query is satisfied from the data preloaded into thecache.andM;Your ability to use the second method of speeding up responses will depend onhow much data is contained on your CD-ROM and how much money you are willingto spend.andP;  If the database is 300MB or so, it might be practical to buy alarge hard disk drive, download the contents of the CD-ROM disk to the harddisk, and use the drive as a standard file server.andP;  Many LAN operatingsystems have limitations on the maximum size of a contiguous hard drive theycan service, but those limitations should disappear under NetWare 386, thevarious releases of 3+Open LAN Manager, and file services for MS-DOS-basedPCs running on minicomputers marketed by companies like ATandamp;T, DEC, andHewlett-Packard.andP;  If you load the data on a big, fast hard drive, in otherwords, the data will travel out to networked PCs very quickly.andM;On a network, you should consider installing multidrive units, such as OnlineComputer Systems' four-drive-capacity unit.andP;  This stack of CD-ROM drives isuseful when people need access to a single database stored on several disks,or when network users need access to different databases at the same time.andM;Because these drives use a laser to read the optical disk, dust and heat aretheir mortal enemies.andP;  Cigarette smoke and other kinds of pollution can slowthe access time of the drive because they obscure the data and force thesystem to retry many times.andP;  Making frequent retries heats the laser lens,and if the drive doesn't have adequate ventilation, the lens will melt.andP;  Inother words, banning smoking and ensuring adequate cooling make good sense.andM;CD-ROM, MEET THE NETWORKandM;Generally, the CD-ROM server is a 286-or 386-based computer dedicated toserving network users.andP;  Its main qualifications: plenty of space to hold astack of CD-ROM drives and lots of memory.andP;  One complete CD-ROM solution,CBIS's CD Server, includes a 12-MHz 286 PC configured to carry multipleCD-ROM drives on NetWare and NetBIOS networks.andM;This PC can perform other duties on the network; it can, for example, act asa tape backup and communications server when it isn't performing its CD-ROMserver functions.andP;  but because CD-ROM drives are so slow, you probably wonhtwant interrupts from these additional services further slowing delivery ofdata from the CD-ROM drive.andM;You can integrate a CD-ROM system into a network in several different ways.andO;The reviews in this issue describe products, like Map Assist, that are onlysoftware (you provide the CD-ROM hardware), combination hardware/softwaresystems for existing networks (for example, Online Computer Systems' Opti-Netand accompanying drive), and complete networks with built-in CD-ROM support,like Artisoft's LANtastic system.andP;  Overall, all systems reviewed had to allowshared access to any vendor's CD-ROM-based data; this excluded LotusDevelopment's own proprietary system, which can access only products from thecompany's One Source family.andM;One major CD-ROM integration package not reviewed in this issue is CD-Net,marketed by Meridian Data.andP;  CD-Net was one of the first such products on themarket, and the company plans to release an updated product that was notready by our review deadline.andM;PC LAN Labs found that integrating CD-ROM support into the network softwareis the best solution, and apparently Microsoft thought the same thing.andP;  Withits latest release of the CD-ROM extensions for MS-DOS, the company addedsupport for MS-NET-based networks by providing an/S switch to thecommand-line options for the extensions.andP;  These networks can subsequentlyoffer CD-ROM support without requiring the use of any special LAN software.andM;In theory, this should work for all MS-NET-based networks--the prime examplebeing IBM's PC LAN--but we recommend contacting the LAN vendor you select forconfirmation before purchasing.andP;  We do know that Hewlett-Packard's HPOfficeShare works withi the new Microsoft CD-ROM extensions through the /Scommand.andM;One complete network system, LAN-tastic, provides CD-ROM support by notmaking any assumptions about the media on which the data is stored and byusing standard DOS calls to access the drives.andP;  Other network vendors havewritten special drivers for talking to CD-ROM drives and included them intheir products; CBIS for example, has done exactly this with Network OS.andM;Of course, any requirement for a CD-ROM system, networked or standalone, isprimarily a need for the information contained in a database published on aCD-ROM disk.andP;  Thanks to the sponsorship of companies like Microsoft and theaggressive action of other vendors, CD-ROM publishing is taking off.andP;  Raw andprocessed information and graphical images of all kinds are coming to themarket through this medium.andM;CD-ROM publishing and CD-ROM sharing are two young technologies that canbenefit from grass-roots support.andP;  If the database you need isn't on CD-ROMalready, ask the publisher for it.andP;  If it's on CD-ROM but the publisherdoesn't have a multiuser license, press the issue.andP;  Networked CD-ROMdatabases can improve the productivity of many kinds of organizations.andP;  Thisis easy-to-use technology with plenty to offer--given the freedom.andM;CD-ROM: WHAT'S OUT THEREandM;Perhaps you're new to CD-ROM and aren't yet sure what's out there.andP;  If so,here's a roundup of some of the hotter titles available, several of which wereviewed in &quot;Archives in Miniature&quot;

W. Wilson, (800) 622-4002,(212) 588-8400; $1,095.andP;  No more searching in dusty volumes.andM;The following commentary analyzes some of the terms and phrases in this tableof features.andP;  The phrases in bold are listed in the same order as in theleft-hand column of the table.andM;Product includesandM;When you add CD-ROM capability to an existing LAN or build a LAN with CD-ROMfunctionality, the system includes at least one PC acting as a CD-ROM server,a CD-ROM drive with controller card, cabling, the Microsoft CD-ROM extensionsto MS-DOS (MSCDEX) or equivalent, and LAN device-sharing software, as well asthe network's standard operating system, redirector software, and interfacecards.andP;  The products listed here provide various parts of the whole.andM;Server must be dedicatedandM;A software product enabling CD-ROM data sharing may require that the PCdesignated as the network's CD-ROM server be dedicated--that is, performingno functions other than managing data requests for users on the network.andP;  Buteven if a package allows use of a nondedicated server, you can often count ona significant performance lag in a CD-ROM server that is also being used as aworkstation.andM;Server monitors CD-ROM drive statusandM;Some products reviewed here display a drive status report on the CD-ROMserver's monitor.andP;  This report details such items as which users areaccessing the CD-ROM-based data and, in the case of units with multidiskcapacity or multiple drives, which disk is being accessed by whom.andM;Type of interface to CD-ROM driveandM;Vendors primarily use either Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)connections of their own proprietary format to connect a CD-ROM drive withits host computer.andP;  Generally, SCSI schemes let you daisy-chain CD-ROM driveswtih additional cables; this saves slot space.andP;  Proprietary signallingschemes may improve the flow of data from the drive to system RAM, althoughyou must then use only CD-ROM drives that the vendor markets.andM;Server/Workstations require(s) MSCDEXandM;The Microsoft extensions cleanly modify DOS to allow it to address a storagedevice larger than 32MB--in this case, as large as 660MB.andP;  While MSCDEX or anequivalent must be run in the network's CD-ROM server and often in eachworkstation accessing the drive, a workstation will require 23K less RAM ifonly the CD-ROM server needs MSCDEX in memory.andM;Disk cachingandM;With the fastest CD-ROM drives clocking in at 300 milliseconds (compared withthe 11- to 85-ms.andP;  range of hard disks), caching--through the softwareprovided or through a third-party product--is the best way to speed dataaccess.andP;  Before selecting a system, however, you must ascertain that yourdesignated CD-ROM server and your workstations have been configured with thetype and amount of memory required by the system.andM;Network compatibilityandM;NetBIOS compatibility provides the CD-ROM networking software with easyconnections to NetBIOS versions from several different companies, includingIBM Corp. and Novell.andP;  If a product lsited is compatible with the IPXprotocol of Novell's NetWare, it will be compatible with NetWare only.andM;EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;* CD Server * LANtasticandM;There are really two ways to add CD-ROM capability to a network: install aLAN supporting the technology or add on a third-party system.andM;In the class of LANs with CD-ROM support built-in, the simplicity, value, andspeed of Artisoft's LANtastic edges out CBIS's CD Server andHewlett-Packard's HP OfficeShare.andP;  Client PCs do not need the MicrosoftCD-ROM extensions--thus conserving RAM--and have access to more than onedrive.andP;  And while the start-up costs may seem high, keep in mind that you'regetting full networking capabilities as well as CD-ROM service for the price.andM;In the third-party add-on category, CBIS's CD Server is the only solution forNetWare networks needing any real computing power.andP;  Advanced GraphicApplications' AGANET does not work with NetWare, and Online Computer Systems'Opti-Net works only if you load NetBIOS, so that leaves Map Assist from FreshTechnology Group.andP;  And although Map Assists is simple and allows aworkstation to share a CD-ROM, its response time is unacceptable forsimultaneous queries.andP;  CBIS's CD Server not only wins by default, it providesgood speed, plenty of expandability, and multidisk support.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
