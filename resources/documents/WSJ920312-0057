U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Helen S. Balick's action wasn't aruling on the merits of the case, merely the green lightnecessary under bankruptcy court rules to proceed with it.The action stems from Scandinavian Airlines System's purchaseof Continental shares owned by Mr. Lorenzo and RobertSnedeker, another director.</LP><TEXT>   The creditors claim the transaction deprived Continentalof an opportunity to sell equity to SAS at a time when thecompany needed additional equity. In addition, they claimthat Messrs. Lorenzo and Snedeker knew, or should have known,that Continental was technically insolvent when it paid themabout $20 million to buy out their employment contracts.   The creditors are seeking $180 million in compensatory andpunitive damages from the two men and Jet Capital Corp.,through which they held most of their stake. Mr. Lorenzo saidthe transactions were &quot;appropriate and in the best interestsof Continental.&quot;   Judge Balick also allowed the creditors to seek recoveryof $124 million from the federal Pension Benefit GuarantyCorp. The agency has said it will oppose the creditors'motion.</TEXT></DOC>
