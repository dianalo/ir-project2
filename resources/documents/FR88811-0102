Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from July 18, 1988 through July 29, 1988. The last biweeklynotice was published on July 27, 1988 (53 FR 28282). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Rules and Procedures Branch,Division of Rules and Records, Office of Administration and Resource Management,U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, and should citethe publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-216 Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Maryland20814 from 8:15 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. Copies of written comments received maybe examined at the NRC Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington,DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions for leave to interveneis discussed below. By September 9, 1988 the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. If a request for a hearing or petition for leave to intervene is filedby the above date, the Commission or an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board,designated by the Commission or by the Chairman of the Atomic Safety andLicensing Board Panel, will rule on the request and/or petition and theSecretary or the designated Atomic Safety and Licensing Board will issuea notice of hearing or an appropriate order. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW.,Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitions are filed during thelast ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requested that the petitionerpromptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephone call to WesternUnion at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700). The Western Unionoperator should be given Datagram Identification Number 3737 and the followingmessage addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d).

STN 50-528, STN50-529 and STN 50-530, Palo Verde Nuclear Generating Station (PVNGS), Units1, 2 and 3 Maricopa County, Arizona </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>March 16, 1988, as supplemented byletter dated July 6, 1988. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment consistsof changes to the Technical Specifications (Appendix A to Facility OperatingLicense Nos. NPF-41, NPF-51 and NPF-74 for PVNGS Units 1, 2 and 3). The proposed change will revise Surveillance Requirement 4.5.2.h whichspecifies flow requirements that the Low Pressure Safety Injection (LPSI)subsystem must meet during flow balance testing. The current requirementstates that each LPSI injection loop must be capable of delivering a totalflow equal to 4900andCx.207;andplusmin; 100 gpm and that each injection legshall be within 100 gpm of the other. The proposed change will revise thetotal injection loop flow to 4800andCx.207;andplusmin; 200 gpm and the injectionleg maximum deviation to 200 gpm. <T3>Basis for Proposed No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensees have provided a discussion of the proposed changes they asrelate to these standards; the discussion is presented below. <T3>Standard 1 - Involve a Significant Increase in the Probability or Consequencesof an Accident Previously Evaluated </T3> The proposed amendments involve revising the acceptance criteria for theLPSI flow balance test of Surveillance Requirement 4.5.2.h. The LPSI subsystemis used, in conjunction with the other ECCS subsystems and the Safety InjectionTanks (SITs), to provide sufficient core cooling flow during postulatedLoss of Coolant Accidents (LOCAs). This change to the LPSI flowrates hasno impact on the probability of occurrence of a LOCA event or any otherdesign basis accident. Additionally, the proposed Technical Specificationchange will not increase the consequences of any accident previously evaluatedin the FSAR. The design basis accident most impacted by the revised LPSIflowrates is the large break LOCA. The most limiting large break LOCA isthe double ended guillotine break of a Reactor Coolant Pump (RCP) dischargeline. An evaluation was performed to determine the effects of the LPSIflowrate changes on this limiting event. It was determined that the flowratechanges would not impact the event consequences since the reduced flowis still sufficient to keep the reactor vessel downcomer annulus full followingdischarge of the SITs. Therefore, this proposed Technical Specificationamendment does not involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated. <T3>Standard 2 - Create the Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accidentfrom any Accident Previously Evaluated </T3> The proposed Technical Specification amendments will not create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously analyzed.The change only allows for a slightly larger variation in LPSI flowrateto account for the variability of throttle valve positions. The LPSI pumpsare the only equipment impacted by this proposed amendment. With the change,the LPSI pumps will still be operated within their design envelope. Therefore,the change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident. <T3>Standard 3 - Involve a Significant Reduction in a Margin of Safety</T3> The proposed Technical Specification amendments will not involve a significantreduction in a margin of safety. Technical Specification bases section3/4.5.2 states that, ``Maintenance of proper flow resistance and pressuredrop in the piping system to each injection point is necessary to: (1)prevent total pump flow from exceeding runout conditions when the systemis in its minimum resistance configuration, (2) provide the proper flowsplit between injection points in accordance with the assumptions usedin the ECCS-LOCA analyses, and (3) provide an acceptable level of totalECCS flow to all injection points equal to or above that assumed in theECCS-LOCA analyses.'' These bases requirements are satisfied for the proposedamendment as follows: (1) pump runout conditions are prevented by maintainingthe maximum LPSI flowrate, allowed by Technical Specifications, at 5000gpm, (2 and 3) the proposed amendment was evaluated against the existingECCS-LOCA analyses and it was determined that the LPSI flowrate changewill not adversely impact the analysis results. The staff has reviewed the licensees' no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensees' analysis. Accordingly, the Commission has proposed to determine that the above changedoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Phoenix Public Library, Businessand Science Division, 12 East McDowell Road, Phoenix, Arizona 85004. <T3>Attorney for licensees: </T3>Mr. Arthur C. Gehr, Snell andamp; Wilmer,3100 Valley Center, Phoenix, Arizona 58007. <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>George W. Knighton <ITAG tagnum="84">Arkansas Power and Light Company, Docket Nos. 45-313 and 50-368, ArkansasNuclear One, Units 1 and 2, Pope County, Arkansas </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 1, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldrevise Facility Operating License Nos. DPR-51 and NPF-6 for Arkansas NuclearOne, Units 1 and 2 (ANO-1andamp;2) to authorize Systems Energy Resources,Incorporated (SERI) to act on behalf of Arkansas Power and Light (APandamp;L),with responsibility for and control over the physical construction, operation,and maintenance of the facility. This action is proposed in conjunctionwith SERI becoming the operator of Waterford Steam Electric Station, Unit3 as well as continuing as operator and owner of Grand Gulf Units, 1 and2. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. APandamp;L hasevaluated the proposed change to Facility Operating Licenses DPR-51 andNPF-6 and has determined the following. SERI presently owns and operates Grand Gulf. The employees of APandamp;Lpresently engaged in the operation of ANO-1andamp;2 will become employeesof SERI. The organizational structure of SERI will provide for clear managementcontrol and effective lines of authority and communication among the organizationalunits involved in the management, operation, and technical support of thefacility. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will not be physical changesto the facility, and all Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting SafetySystem Settings, and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specificationswill remain unchanged. With the exception of administrative changes toreflect the role of SERI, the quality assurance program, security plan,and training program are unaffected. With regard to emergency plans, certainphysical and personnel resources, limited to support in administrativeareas but not inclusive of decision making authority, will continue tobe provided by APandamp;L in support of these activities. The licensee statesthat decisional responsibilities related to accident recognition and classification,mitigation and corrective actions, radiological assessment and protectiveaction recommendations and coordination with state and local authoritieswill rest with SERI personnel. APandamp;L corporate management will providedirection to other non-nuclear APandamp;L facilities for support to ANO-1andamp;2.Operating agreements will ensure continued compliance with among others,General Design Criterion 17 of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50 on ElectricalPower Systems. Therefore, the proposed changes will not increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The design and design bases of ANO-1andamp;2 remain the same. Therefore,the current plant safety analyses remain complete and accurate in addressingthe licensing basis events and analyzing plant response and consequences.The Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings,and Safety Limits are not affected by the proposed amendment. With theexception of administrative changes to reflect the role of SERI, plantprocedures are unaffected. As such, the plant conditions for which thedesign basis accident analyses have been performed are still valid. Therefore,the proposed amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated. Plant safety margins are established for and reflected in Limiting Conditionsfor Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings, and Safety Limits specifiedin the Technical Specifications. Since there will be no change to the physicaldesign or operation of the plant, there will be no change to any of theseor any other margins. The proposed amendment therefore will not involvea reduction in a margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation and agrees with the conclusions.Therefore, based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that theproposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>Tomlinson Library, ArkansasTechnical University, Russellville, Arkansas 72801 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Nicholas S. Reynolds, Esq., Bishop, Liberman,Cook, Purcell and Reynolds, 1200 Seventeenth Street, NW., Washington, DC20036 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Jose A. Calvo <ITAG tagnum="84">Commonwealth Edison Company, Docket Nos. STN 50-237 and STN 50-249,Dresden Nuclear Power Station, Unit Nos. 2 and 3, Grundy County, Illinois</ITAG><T3>Date of application for amendment request: </T3>March 18, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendment wouldclarify the applicability of the containment oxygen concentration and drywelltorus differential pressure Limiting Conditions of Operation (LCO) andSurveillance Requirements. The changes that are described in this proposedamendment are intended to provide a clear action statement should the oxygenconcentration or torus drywell differential pressure LCOs be exceeded.The action statement would provide 24 hours to either restore the LCO orbe in startup/hot standby in the subsequent 6 hours and cold shutdown inthe following 24 hours. There are several administrative changes associatedwith this amendment where the affected oxygen concentration or torus drywelldifferential pressure Technical Specifications have been renumbered asa result of this change. Finally, several changes have been made to theTechnical Specification and/or Bases for clarification. These changes,as well as the numbering changes, are considered to be administrative innature. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.Commonwealth Edison has evaluated this proposed amendment and determinedthat it involves no significant hazards consideration. In accordance withthe criteria of 10 CFR 50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating licenseinvolves no significant hazards considerations if operation of the facility,in accordance with the proposed amendment, would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because: (a) Power operation is presently permitted with containment oxygen concentrationgreater than 4% for only 24 hours subsequent to going to run and 24 hoursprior to a reactor shutdown. The change permits 24 hours of power operationwith the primary containment deinerted unrelated to reactor startup orshutdown to allow personnel to enter the drywell at power. Drywell entriesare made to identify any water leakage, affect minor repairs and enableequipment lubrication. Drywell entries other than during startup are rare.The change in time that the drywell will not be inerted during power operationallowed by this proposed change is small. Additionally, there are currentlyseveral other Mark I BWRs that are licensed for operation with a deinertedcontainment for periods greater than 24 hours. Power operation is presently permitted with drywell or torus differentialpressure less and 1 psid for only 24 hours subsequent to going to run and24 hours prior to a reactor shutdown. The change permits 24 hours of poweroperation without 1 psi differential pressure unrelated to reactor startupor shutdown to allow personnel to enter the drywell as power. There isno change in consequences of relaxing the 1 psi differential pressure becausethe torus was analyzed for 0.0 psi presure differential as part of theMARK I Containment Short Term Program and was found to meet the NRC staffs'acceptance criteria. Therefore, these changes do not significantly increase the probabilityor consequences of previously evaluated accidents. (b) The other changes to the Technical Specifications include the renumberingof other inter-related portions of the Technical Specifications (whichwere affected by the proposed change) or are changes that are being soughtfor clarification purposes. These changes are considered to be administrativein nature. (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated because: (a) The effects of short-term deinerting have been analyzed in the FSAR.Additionally, the torus was analyzed for 0.0 psi drywell to torus differentialpressure as part of the Mark I Containment Short Term Program and was foundto meet the NRC staffs' acceptance criteria. Consequently, the possibility of creating a new or different kind of accidentfrom any accident previously evaluated is unchanged. (b) The other types of changes noted in the proposed amendment are administrativein nature. (3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety because: (a) FSAR analyses have shown that for design basis accidents, the longterm combustible gas control system (ACAD/CAM) can prevent a combustiblegas mixture of 4% hydrogen even with a deinerted containment. Therefore,peak containment pressure is bounded by the FSAR LOCA analysis. The marginof safety for the torus drywell differential pressure is not degraded asa result of this change because the torus was analyzed for 0.0 psi drywellto torus differential pressure as part of the Mark I Containment ShortTerm Program and was found to meet the NRC staffs' acceptance criteria.Therefore, the pressure suppression is maintained and the changes do notreduce the margin of safety. (b) These changes are administrative and therefore do not impact the marginof safety. Therefore, since the proposed license amendment satisfies the criteriaspecified in 10 CFR 50.92, Commonwealth Edison has determined that a nosignificant hazards consideration exist for these items. The staff has reviewed Commonwealth Edison's no significant hazards analysisand concurs with its conclusions. Therefore, the staff proposes to determinethat the requested changes do no involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Morris Public Library, 604Liberty Street, Morris, Illinois 60450. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael I.

The proposed revision to the Technical Specifications for Dresden Units2 and 3 involves changing ranges and panel locations for various typesof instrumentation associated with post-accident and containment monitoring.The changes which are described below, primarily affect Tables 3.2.6, 4.2.1and 4.2.4 and also Sections 3.7/4.7 of the Technical Specifications. (1) The drywell temperature readout location is changed from a back panelto a front panel in the control room. (2) The drywell pressure range for the +70 mid-range pressure transmitteris changed from ``0-75 psig'' to ``-5 to 70 psig''. (3) A redundant wide range reactor vessel pressure indicator has been addedon panel 902(3)-3. (4) A wide range reactor vessel level pen indicator has been placed ona 902(3)-5 recorder which receives its input from one of the existing widerange level channels. (5) The torus water level sight glass range is changed from ``18'' to ``40''inches. Also the two narrow ranges ``-25 to +25 inches'' and ``-7 to +3inches'' are being combined to form one range, ``20 to +20 inches''. In addition several administrative changes have been included in the requestedamendment. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee addressed the above three standards in the amendment applicationas follows: (1) The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequence of an accident previously evaluated because the changesreflect the addition of instrumentation which serves similar purposes asexisting instrumentation. Where ranges have been slightly modified, theparameter will continue to be monitored in a range that covers its designoperating span. Panel locations for the instruments are listed in the TechnicalSpecification tables for informational purposes so that updating the listto reflect additions or relocations (which increase redundancy or serveto enhance visibility for the operator, respectively) has no detrimentalimpact on accident probability or consequences. Similarly, clarificationsor corrections of typographical errors are administrative changes whichimprove Technical Specification reliability and therefore can have no detrimentalimpact. (2) The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because changingthe Technical Specifications to reflect improved instrument ranges, redundancy,or visibility does not affect or change design operating limits or protectivesetpoints. The new ranges and panel changes continue to allow the parametersto be monitored during a post-accident situation or during normal operation.No new or different modes of operation are allowed by these changes orthe proposed administrative changes. Nor will they affect any systems orequipment which could initiate an accident. (3) The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety because in no instance do these range changes, panel changesor administrative changes affect the Technical Specification safety limits.The design operating limits and/or set points are sufficiently containedwithin the new ranges. Additionally, the range changes have no effect onthe functional test or calibration frequencies required by these TechnicalSpecification tables. All parameters will continue to be monitored as currentlyrequired. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards analysis givenabove. Based on this review, the staff proposes to determine that the proposedamendments meet the three 10 CFR 50.92(c) standards and do not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Morris Public Library, 604Liberty Street, Morris, Illinois 60450. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Michael I.

The changes make it clearer that the reactor trip setpointsare expressed in terms relative to the delta-T values at full power (i.e.,delta-T<T2>o</T2>), so as to be consistent with the manner in which delta-T isindicated by the plant instrumentation. Since these amendments involveno changes to plant equipment, setpoints, operating limits, or procedures,they have no adverse effect on any accident or safety margins, and theymeet the three 10 CFR 50.92(c) standards stated above. Proposed Change 3 requires the determination of RCS total flow rate anddelta-T at full power by precision heat balance measurements at the beginningof each fuel cycle. The licensee has observed that actual values of RCSflow and delta-T differ from one fuel cycle to the next. It is, therefore,desirable to perform the precision heat balance measurements as soon aspossible after reaching full power in a new fuel cycle, rather than performingthem every 18 months as presently required. Because the time interval betweenmeasurements is shortened, the revised TS is more restrictive. Until thecycle-specific full power value for each loop's delta-T is determined,the licensee ensures the conservative overprediction of reactor power bysetting the full power delta-T reading to be 1anddegrees; F lower than forthe previous cycle. The proposed Change 3 is more appropriate because it requires the performanceof the precision heat balance measurements at a time (beginning of a cycle)when they would be most likely to detect a change in RCS flow and fullpower delta-T. There are no changes to plant procedures or hardware. Therefore,Change 3 does not involve a significant increase in the probability orconsequences of an accident previously evaluated, nor create the possibilityof a new or different accident from any accident previously evaluated.Change 3 also does not involve a significant reduction in a margin of safetybecause it does not relax existing requirements; rather, it is more conservativeand restrictive, because the current specifications do not specificallyrequire rescaling at the beginning of each fuel cycle or if more than onecycle occurs within an 18 month span. Change 4 requires the period for calibration of all of the delta-T instrumentationchannels to be at the beginning of each cycle after completion of the precisionheat balance measurements. As with the Change 3 measurements, it is desirableto perform these calibrations at the beginning of a cycle, rather thanevery 18 months as presently required, because actual values of delta-Tat full power have been observed to differ from one cycle to the next.The channel calibrations and the precision heat balance measurements atthe beginning of a cycle ensure that the assumptions in the safety analysisremain valid. Calibration of the delta-T channels to the new full powervalues should only be necessary at the beginning of each cycle, as thelicensee expects that all drifts and fluctuations over the course of acycle should remain within the allowances assumed in the safety analysisfor that cycle. Like Change 3, proposed Change 4 is more appropriate and more conservative,and meets the three standards of 10 CFR 50.92(c) for the same reasons asgiven above for Change 3. Change 5 is intended to correct Action Statement 7 to state that it hasbeen ``deleted'' from Table 3.3-1. This change is purely administrativeand involves no safety concerns. The Commission has provided examples ofamendments likely to involve no significant hazards considerations (51FR 7144). One example of this type is (i), ``A purely administrative changeto Technical Specifications: For example, a change to achieve consistencythroughout the Technical Specifications, correction of an error, or a changein nomenclature.'' This example applies to the proposed Change 5. On the basis of the above considerations the Commission proposes to determinethat the proposed amendments would involve no significant hazards considerations.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Atkins Library, Universityof North Carolina, Charlotte (UNCC Station), North Carolina 28223. <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Mr. Albert Carr, Duke Power Company, 422South Church Street, Charlotte, North Carolina 28242 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>David B.

Similarly, TS 4.4.4.3 requires the emergency power supply forthe PORVs and block valves to be demonstrated operable periodically bymanually transferring motive and control power from the normal to the emergencypower supply and operating the valves through a complete cycle of fulltravel. These requirements are unnecessary and inappropriate because eachof these components is permanently connected to an emergency power source.The NRC has previously reviewed the designs for power supply to these componentsand has found them to be acceptable. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from an accident previously evaluated; or(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Because the components are permanently connected to essential power, thefunction of these components is unaffected by deletion of the surveillancerequirement, and the change, therefore, would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,(2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety.

The currentandCx.207;andplusmin;1% safetyvalve tolerance will be retained for valve testing and adjusting; howevera tolerance of +1%, -3% would allow more flexibility during plant operationand potentially reduce the number of licensee event reports (LERs) thatresult when valve setpoints are found outside of the tolerance. The newtolerances would provide a wider allowable range to accommodate setpointdrift without compromising the analyzed safety valve relief capability.The proposed changes would be similar to those approved in Amendment No.115 for Beaver Valley Unit 1. The essential function of the safety valves is the protection of the primaryand secondary systems from overpressure. If the proposed amendment is issued,the safety margin would remain unchanged since the upper limit (+1%) wherethe valve will open would remain unchanged. The reduced limit of the lowertolerance, however, would reduce the frequency of valves found outsidethe specified range, thus resulting in reduced worker radiological exposureassociated with valve testing and adjusting. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The primary and secondary coolant overpressure limits are not changedby the proposed amendment since the upper limits of pressure will stillbe maintained by safety valve settings of +1%. Furthermore, during testing,the valves will be adjusted to a tolerance ofandCx.207;andplusmin;1%. The lessrestrictive tolerance of +1%, -3% mainly serves to provide operationalflexibility and to reduce the number of LERs. Since parameters that couldaffect safety would not be changed, the proposed amendment would not increasethe probability of occurrence or the consequences of accidents previouslyevaluated. Since no hardware modifications or changes in operation procedureswould be made, the proposed changes would not create the possibility ofa new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated.The safety margin is controlled by the upper tolerance limit, which isnot changed; therefore, there is no decrease in the safety margin. On the basis of the above discussion, the staff proposes to determine thatthe amendment involves no significant hazard consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

The proposed change wouldonly clarify an existing requirement, and is not a change in substance.(b) Table 3.3-3, 3.3-4, 3.3-5 and 4.3-2 of both units' TS would be modifiedto delete one of the auxiliary feedwater actuation signals (turbine-drivenpump discharge pressure low with steam valve open). The current TSs providean exhaustive listing of all the actuation signals for the auxiliary feedwatersystem. The licensee stated that the subject signal only serves as backupand has not been credited in safety analyses, and proposes to delete itsrequirements from the above tables. (c) Surveillance requirement 4.4.1.3.1 of both units' TS would be revisedto eliminate the requirement to test the residual heat removal (RHR) pumpson recirculation.

As stated above, the proposed amendment affects only certain surveillance,and testing requirements of the units. These changes do not adversely affectthe current capability of the plant systems. Therefore, the proposed amendmentdoes not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof a previously evaluated accident.

Thus, no adverse safety considerations are introduced by the change.Therefore, the probability of an accident or a malfunction of a differenttype than previously evaluated would not be created.

Advances in leakage rate testingsubsequent to the issuance of ANSI N45.4-1972 have provided improved testmethods, including a newer method of evaluating test data called the MassPoint method. The Mass Point method is described in ANSI/ANS 56.8-1981,``Containment System Leakage Testing Requirements,'' and is consideredto be more accurate in determining containment leakage rates. The proposed amendments would modify TS 4.6.1.2, ``Containment Leakage''for the St. Lucie Plant, Unit Nos. 1 and 2. The requirement to use ANSIN45.4-1972 would be deleted, and the use of the Mass-Point method wouldbe authorized.

A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee states that: The proposed APLHGR and LHGR limits for GE8x8EB fuel type BD296A were evaluatedby GE using NRC-approved methods documented in the ``General Electric StandardApplication for Reactor Fuel,'' NEDE-24011-P-A-8 (GESTAR-II). Compliancewith those limits will ensure that BD296A fuel meets specified acceptablefuel design limits in the Unit 1 reactor. All fuel safety design basesin the Plant Hatch Unit 1 Final Safety Analysis Report (FSAR) are met byGE8x8EB fuel. The proposed APLHGR limit for BD 296 A fuel were calculatedusing SAFER/GESTR-LOCA which demonstrated that the power level of GE8x8EBfuel types operating in the Unit 1 core will not be limited by LOCA considerationsso long as approved LHGR limits are met. The proposed LHGR limit for theGE8x8EB fuel in conjunction with the proposed APLHGR limit will ensurethat the specified acceptable fuel mechanical design limits given in GESTAR-IIare met. The 9x9 lead fuel assemblies have been evaluated by ANF for use in theHatch reactors. These fuel assemblies were designed to be neutronicallysimilar to the GE B/P8DRB284H fuel such that the existing APLHGR limit(when properly adjusted to account for the different number of rods) andMCPR thermal limits for B/P8DRB284H fuel will be applicable to them aswell. The ANF 9x9 fuel assemblies were previously approved by the NRC foruse in Hatch Unit 2. A revision to the existing MAPFAC<T2>F</T2> figure (Figure 3.11-1, Sheet 8) is proposed to indicate thatthe limits are applicable to all fuel types in use at Plant Hatch, as wellas the proposed GE8x8EB fuel and the 9x9 LFAs. Coefficients on Figure 3.11-1,Sheet 8 which refer to the older 7x7, 8x8, and 8x8R fuel types are deletedbecause these fuel types are no longer in use at Plant Hatch. Therefore,to simplify the Technical Specifications, all fuel type labels will bedeleted from the MAPFAC<T2>F</T2> figure. Since the 7x7 fuel type is no longer in use at Plant Hatch, referencesto this older fuel type are deleted in Specifications 3/4 11.B, 3/4 11.C,and the corresponding Bases. Figures 3.11-2 and 3.11-5, which apply specificallyto 7x7 fuel, are also deleted. The proposed changes do not involve a significant hazards considerationfor the following reasons: 1. Use of GE8x8EB fuel and ANF 9x9 LFAs does not involve a significantincrease in the probability of an accident previously evaluated, becauseno significant changes in plant design or procedures will occur as a resultof this change. Any future core designs made possible by the proposed changeeither have been or will be evaluated, using NRC-approved methods, andshown to meet the approved acceptance criteria for analysis of the limitingaccidents previously evaluated. Therefore, the consequences of an accidentwould not be significantly increased as a result of the use of the newfuel types. 2. The proposed change does not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any previously analyzed, because no change in plantdesign or operation is involved, except for relatively minor changes inthe fuel design. The GE and ANF fuel types proposed for use in Unit 1 have been genericallyreviewed and approved by the USNRC. The impact of the new fuel types hasbeen evaluated against the relevant safety analyses on a generic and PlantHatch-specific basis. In addition, the specific nuclear designs addressedby the proposed change are sufficiently similar to approved nuclear designsbeing used at other BWR-4 plants. The possibility of a new kind of accidentis not created. 3. The proposed change does not involve a significant reduction in themargin of safety for the same reasons stated in Item 1 above. The staff has considered the proposed changes and agrees with the licensee'sevaluation with respect to the three standards.

Hatch Nuclear Plant, Unit 1, Appling County, Georgia </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 11, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>This amendment would modifythe Technical Specification (TS) requirements regarding the secondary containmentboundary, as follows: (1) A normal secondary containment boundary as nowspecified in the TS would be maintained during most plant conditions, buta modified secondary containment boundary would be authorized while theunit is shutdown, provided certain conditions are met; and (2) the changealso would make several editorial corrections to the TS. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has provided the following information in support of the requestedchanges: <T3>Proposed Change 1: </T3> Planning and scheduling maintenance work during Unit 1 refueling outagesis a difficult task due to the inability to perform simultaneous work onthe Unit 1 main steam isolation valves (MSIVs) and the Unit 1 turbine stopvalves without breaching secondary containment integrity. The normal Unit1 secondary containment boundary includes the Unit 1 reactor building areabelow the refueling floor and the common Units 1 and 2 area above the refuelingfloor. Therefore, simultaneous work on both groups of valves could introducea leakage path through the reactor building, and consequently, secondarycontainment. This change will revise the Plant Hatch Unit 1 Technical Specificationspertaining to secondary containment boundary requirements. The change willestablish two modes of secondary containment to facilitate activities duringoutage situations. A ``normal'' secondary containment mode will be maintainedduring most plant conditions, and a ``modified'' secondary containmentconfiguration may be established if certain conditions are met while theunit is shutdown. Specifically, this proposed change will modify LimitingConditions for Operation Specifications 3.7.C.1 and 3.7.C.2, the associatedsurveillance requirements (Specifications 4.7.C.1 and 4.7.C.2), the DesignFeatures Section 5.0.D.2 and the applicable bases. Similar temporary changes were approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(NRC) with the issuance of Amendment 91 to the Unit 1 Technical Specifications.That amendment provided a temporary revision to the secondary containmentrelated Technical Specifications during the 1982 refueling outage to permitmajor modification work associated with the Mark I Containment Long-TermProgram. The intent of the change described herein is to permanently implementthe temporary changes contained in Amendment 91. Proposed Change 1 does not involve a significant hazards considerationfor the following reasons: 1. It does not involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated, because the basic function of theUnit 1 secondary containment system, which is to maintain a 1/4-inch negativepressure on the common Unit 1 and Unit 2 area above the refueling floor,remains unchanged in the modified configuration. Therefore, refueling activitiesand Unit 2 reactor operation are permitted to continue without invokinga limiting condition for operation (LCO). 2. It does not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously evaluated, because the modified configuration willexclude the Unit 1 reactor building area below the refueling floor andStandby Gas Treatment System (SGTS) suction to that area so that secondarycontainment integrity in the common area above the refueling floor canbe maintained. This condition is permissible only under conditions specifiedby 3.7.C.2, since Unit 1 activities that may lead to a postulated releaseof radioactivity during a Unit 1 refueling outage will be confined to thecommon refueling floor area. Therefore, under certain conditions, SGTSservice is not required in the Unit 1 reactor building area below the refuelingfloor. 3. The proposed change does not involve a reduction in the margin of safety,because secondary containment integrity for the modified configurationwill continue to maintain the capability to obtain a 1/4-inch water gaugenegative pressure in secondary containment. Therefore, the radiologicalconsequences to the environment following a postulated refueling accidentare not increased. <T3>Proposed Change 2 </T3> Existing Technical Specifications 4.7.C.1.a and 4.7.C.2.a require thata preoperational secondary containment capability test be conducted. Theword ``preoperational'' conveys a preoperating license condition carry-overwhich is not intended. By deleting the word ``preoperational'' from bothspecifications, confusion will be eliminated. Specification 4.7.C.1.b. page 3.7-13, should be deleted since the identicalmaterial is stated on page 3.7-12. Specifications 3.7.C.2 and 4.7.C.2, page 3.7-13, are numbered incorrectly.They should be numbered 3.7.C.3 and 4.7.C.3, respectively, since Specifications3.7.C.2 and 4.7.C.2 are properly located on page 3.7-12a. These numberingerrors were inadvertently introduced when the Plant Hatch Unit 1 TechnicalSpecifications Amendment No. 100 was issued. Since these changes are editorial in nature, they do not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated,do not create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany previously evaluated, nor involve a reduction in the margin of safety.The staff has considered the proposed changes and agrees with the licensee'sevaluation with respect to the three standards.

The existing TS requirementsto scram the reactor when the pool temperature reaches 110anddegrees; F andto depressurize the reactor vessel when the pool temperature reaches 120anddegrees;F remain unchanged. (2) The Unit 2 TS would be modified to delete referencesto the water volume in the suppression pool. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's May 13, 1988, submittal provided an evaluation of the proposedchanges with respect to these three standards. <T3>Basis for Proposed Change 1: </T3> Historically, the suppression pool temperature limit has been chosen basedupon the maximum expected service water temperature. For most BWRs, thislimit is in the range of 90anddegrees; F to 95anddegrees; F. For Plant Hatch,the limit is 95anddegrees; F. Many licensing analyses use this pool temperatureas the initial condition. Generic evaluations performed for the BoilingWater Reactor Owners Group (BWROG) suppression pool temperature limit (SPTL)Committee show that the normal suppression pool temperature limit for BWRswith Mark I containments can be raised to 110anddegrees; F with no adverseimpact on plant safety. A proprietary General Electric report, EAS-19-0388,provided as an enclosure to the licensee's May 13, 1988 submittal, discussesthe impact of raising the pool temperature on the existing Plant Hatchsafety analyses. These evaluations include assessment of Anticipated TransientsWithout Scram (ATWS) events and Emergency Procedure Guidelines (EPGs),even though these areas are beyond the historical design basis of the plant.The GE report, EAS-19-0388, details the results of the Plant Hatch evaluationsand provides the technical bases for the proposed Technical Specificationchanges. The evaluations consider the effect of the proposed changes onsafety relief valve (SRV) loads, containment response, and emergency corecooling system (ECCS) performance and show that the changes are acceptable.1. These changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, because applicableaccident analyses that could be impacted by raising the suppression pooloperating limit have been examined and found to be acceptable. The scramand depressurization limits are unchanged. 2. The possibility of a different kind of accident from any analyzed previouslyis not created by these changes, since the proposed changes would onlyrevise an operating limit on permissible pool temperature. This changedoes not involve the potential for a new accident type, since plant designand function are unchanged. 3. Margins of safety are not significantly reduced by these changes, becausethe impact of the proposed pool temperature has been evaluated relativeto safety analyses (GE report EAS-19-0888), and margins have been shownto be insignificantly impacted. Sufficient heat capacity remains in thesuppression pool for complete condensation of decay and sensible heat followingan accident or reactor shutdown. <T3>Basis for Proposed Change 2: </T3> The proposed change to the Unit 2 Technical Specifications deleting referencesto suppression pool water volume is editorial, since water level monitoringwill still be required. Obviously, the actual volume of water was nevermonitored; required water levels correspond to a fixed water volume unlesssubstantial modifications to the submerged portion of the torus are performed.When such modifications are performed (e.g. the Mark I Containment LongTerm Program), the impact of the changes on relevant safety evaluationsare assessed. The deletion of the references to the suppression pool water volume areeditorial in nature and have no impact on plant safety. The required suppressionpool water levels remain unchanged. The deletion is consistent with the``Examples of Amendments that are considered Not Likely to Involve SignificantHazards Considerations,'' listed on page 14870 of the April 16, 1983, issueof the <T4>Federal Register. </T4> The staff has considered the proposed changes and agrees with the license'sevaluations with respect to the three standards. On this basis, the Commission has determined that the requested amendmentsmeet the three standards and, therefore, has made a proposed determinationthat the amendment application does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Appling County Public Library,301 City Hall Drive, Baxley, Georgia 31513 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

Hatch Nuclear Plant, Units 1 and 2, Appling County, Georgia </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>June 20, 1988 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The amendments would modifythe Technical Specifications for both Unit 1 and Unit 2 to delete all referencesto the main control room (MCR) chlorine detectors and to automatic isolationof the main control room environmental control system (MCRECS) on highchlorine level. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists (10 CFR 50.92(c)). A proposed amendment toan operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationsif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's June 20, 1988 submittal provided the following evaluationof the proposed changes with respect to these three standards: <T3>Bases for Proposed Change: </T3> The MCRECS for Units 1 and 2 limits the amount of chlorine entering thecommon MCR in the event of a chlorine tank rupture (Reference the Unit2 Final Safety Analysis Report). The current Plant Hatch design basis includesthe tank rupture of two 1-ton cylinders of chlorine gas. The current designbasis of the chlorine detectors is to provide a signal for the automaticisolation of the MCR outside air intake dampers before the concentrationof chlorine reaches a hazardous level inside the MCR. A Plant Design Change Request is being prepared to: (1) remove all chlorinecylinders from the site, (2) replace the present chlorination system witha sodium hypochlorination system, and (3) eliminate the automatic isolationmode of the MCRECS, including the MCR chlorine detectors. Once all thechlorine tanks have been emptied, the threat to MCR habitability, resultingfrom chlorine release, will be eliminated. Following the proposed change, no gaseous chlorine will be stored or usedon site. Both the circulating water (CW) and the residual heat removalservice water (RHRSW)/plant service water (PSW) systems will be treatedwith sodium hypochlorite. Likewise, the sanitary water and plant sewagesystems will be treated by an alternative method. The proposed change to delete the onsite storage of gaseous chlorine effectivelyeliminates the need for automatic isolation of the MCR, since the isolationprocess is actuated only by chlorine detection. Therefore, there is noneed for the MCR chlorine detectors to remain in service. <T3>Basis for No Significant Hazards Consideration Determination: </T3>The proposed amendment does not involve a significant hazards considerationfor the following reasons: 1. The change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityof occurrence or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, becauseremoval of chlorine cylinders presently stored on site will eliminate therisk of a chlorine release to MCR operators. 2. The change does not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any previously evaluated, because the removal of onsitechlorine eliminates the need for automatic isolation of the MCR due tochlorine release. The sodium hypochlorite tanks will be located in a safetydike in the chlorination building. Even in the event of tank rupture, notoxic vapors will be released, and consequently, a threat to MCR operatorswill not exist. 3. The margin of safety is not reduced significantly by the proposed changesince the proposed change obviates a potential accident scenario. The staff has considered the proposed changes and agrees with the licensee'sevaluation with respect to the three standards. On this basis, the Commission has determined that the requested amendmentsmeet the three standards and, therefore, has made a proposed determinationthat the amendment application does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Appling County Public Library,301 City Hall Drive, Baxley, Georgia 31513 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

According to 10 CFR50.92(c), a proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significanthazards considerations if operation of the facility in accordance withthe amendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposed amendment does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. This is an administrativechange that does not affect current accident analyses. The proposed changes to Figure 6.2.2-1 and Sections 6.3.1 and 6.5.1.2 areadministrative changes that clarify but do not change the intent of theSpecifications. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any previously evaluated. The proposedchanges are administrative changes only and thus do not involve any designchanges, new requirements, or new modes of operation. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The intent of the existing Technical Specification requirementswould remain unchanged. The proposed changes to Figure 6.2.2-1 and Sections6.3.1 and 6.5.1.2 are administrative changes that do not affect a marginof safety.

Thisaction is proposed in conjunction with SERI becoming the operator of ArkansasNuclear One, Units 1 and 2 as well as continuing as operator and ownerof Grand Gulf Units, 1 and 2. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,(3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. LPandamp;L hasevaluated the proposed change to Facility Operating License NPF-38 andhas determined the following. SERI presently owns and operates Grand Gulf. The employees of LPandamp;Lpresently engaged in the operation of Waterford 3 will become employeesof SERI. The organizational structure of SERI will provide for clear managementcontrol and effective lines of authority and communication among the organizationalunits involved in the management, operation, and technical support of thefacility. As a result of the proposed amendment, there will not be physical changesto the facility, and all Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting SafetySystem Settings, and Safety Limits specified in the Technical Specificationswill remain unchanged. With the exception of administrative changes toreflect the role of SERI, the quality assurance program, security plan,and training program are unaffected. With regard to emergency plans, certainphysical and personnel resources, limited to support in administrativeareas but not inclusive of decision making authority, will continue tobe provided by LPandamp;L in support of these activities. The licensee statesthat decisional responsibilities related to accident recognition and classification,mitigation and corrective actions, radiological assessment and protectiveaction recommendations and coordination with state and local authoritieswill rest with SERI personnel. LPandamp;L corporate management will providedirection to other non-nuclear LPandamp;L facilities for support to Waterford3. Operating agreements will ensure continued compliance with among others,General Design Criterion 17 of Appendix A to 10 CFR Part 50 on ElectricalPower Systems. Therefore, the proposed changes will not increase the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The design and design bases of Waterford 3 remain the same. Therefore,the current plant safety analyses remain complete and accurate in addressingthe licensing basis events and analyzing plant response and consequences.The Limiting Conditions for Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings,and Safety Limits are not affected by the proposed amendment. With theexception of administrative changes to reflect the role of SERI, plantprocedures are unaffected. As such, the plant conditions for which thedesign basis accident analyses have been performed are still valid. Therefore,the proposed amendment cannot create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident than previously evaluated. Plant safety margins are established for and reflected in Limiting Conditionsfor Operation, Limiting Safety System Settings, and Safety Limits specifiedin the Technical Specifications. Since there will be no change to the physicaldesign or operation of the plant, there will be no change to any of theseor any other margins. The proposed amendment therefore will not involvea reduction in a margin of safety. The staff has reviewed the licensee's evaluation and agrees with the conclusions.Therefore, based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that theproposed license amendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>University of New OrleansLibrary, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

This request relates directlyto the previous request dated June 24, 1986 as noticed on September 11,1986 (51 FR 32381). <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3> The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated,or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee's June 24, 1986 request included, among other things, increasingthe level of enrichment for the fuel storage areas to 4.10 weight percentU-235. The licensee was requested at that time to accept an enrichmentof 4.0 weight percent because the assessment of the generic environmentalimpact of increased enrichments on the fuel cycle and fuel transportationoutlined in Tables S-3 of 10 CFR Part 51 and S-4 of 10 CFR Part 52 wasnot complete. The June 24, 1986 request was therefore noticed on September11, 1986 (51 FR 32381) with a limit of 4.0 weight percent U-235. The notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 29, 1988 (53 FR 6054), states thatthe NRC environmental assessment of extended burnup fuel is complete andthat environmental impacts summarized in Tables S-3 of 10 CFR Part 51 andS-4 of 10 CFR Part 52 bound the corresponding impacts for burnup levelsup to 60 Gwd/MtU and enrichments up to 5.0 weight percent U-235. This boundsthe licensee's request for enrichments up to 4.1 weight percent U-235 forburnups up to 60 Gwd/MtU. As such, the licensee is requesting their originalrequest and analyses be accepted. In license amendment number 7 issued on October 16, 1986, the NRC performeda safety evaluation for increasing the level of enrichment for the fuelstorage areas to 4.10 weight percent U-235 and found all analyses and proposedchanges acceptable. The amendment was issued at 4.0 weight percent butthe findings of 4.10 weight percent remain valid and support the followingdetermination of no significant hazards consideration. The calculated K-eff values, including uncertainties, indicate that thefuel storage configurations are substantially sub-critical, and the probabilityof a criticality event in these areas is not significantly increased. Nophysical change is being made to the storage areas. Since a criticalityevent is demonstrated to be unfeasible, there is no increased consequencesfor such a postulated event. The change will not involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of any accident previouslyevaluated. The proposed change will not introduce any physical changes being madeto the facility and will not change how the facility is operated. Therefore,the change will not create the possibility of a new or different kind ofaccident from any accident previously evaluated. The licensee's June 1986 request resulted in the approval to raise thefuel enrichment level from 3.7 to 4.0 weight percent but the evaluationfor that change found that 4.10 weight percent was acceptable and withinthe established criteria. The licensee's current request is to amend theTechnical Specification to the previous acceptable level of 4.10 weightpercent. The decrease in safety margin from 3.7 to 4.0 weight percent waspreviously found not to be significant and this is borne out by the NRCsafety evaluation to 4.10 weight percent. The proposed change does notinvolve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. Based on the above considerations, the staff proposes to determine thatthe proposed change does not involve a significant hazards consideration.<T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>University of New OrleansLibrary, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

(SERI) has provided an analysis of significanthazards considerations in its request for a license amendment. The licenseehas concluded, with appropriate bases, that the proposed amendment meetsthe three standards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significanthazards considerations. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsin 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">1. No significant increase in the probability or the consequencesof an accident previously evaluated results from this change. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The functional tests performed since commercial operation, approximately735 for each channel ([greater than] 2900 total surveillances), were reviewedwith no identified as found failures. Additionally, as found trip setpointswere reviewed for drift and were found to show negligible drive over athree month period between channel calibrations. This confirms the reliabilityof the LPSP and HPSP trip units and supports the change to their frequencyof functional testing to 31 days consistent with other identical trip units.The reliability of the system is adequately assured by the performanceof the Channel Functional Tests prior to startup and monthly thereafterfor the LPSP and HPSP. Other Rosemount Trip units are surveyed at a monthlyfrequency with acceptable performance results. SERI has addressed the effecton reliability of channel functional testing frequency for identical tripunits in the Reactor Protection System. Specifically, it has been demonstratedthat there is no change in the Reactor Protection System reliability whenthe testing of these trip units is performed more frequently than monthly.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This change does not involve a design change or physical change tothe plant. Therefore, the revised surveillance frequency will not effect(sic) the consequences of an accident previously analyzed. Failure of theseinstruments due to the revised frequency of surveillance (which is notpostulated) would have no effect on the probability of an uncoupled roddrop or an operator error leading to a rod withdrawal error. No other safetyanalyses as discussed in UFSAR Chapters 6 and 15 would be affected. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The change to the mode applicability of the HPSP is based on actualsystem design. Below 70% power, the HPSP does not function and is not requiredto function. Eliminating operability and surveillance requirements forthe HPSP below the Low Power Setpoint cannot pose any changes in accidentassumptions or sequence of events. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c.

This change would not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The function of the system is unaffected by the elimination ofdaily functional tests. There have been no as found failures in the previous2900+ functional tests of these channels' trip units and negligible observedtrip setpoint drift over the surveillance intervals being proposed. Propersystem operation will be assured by monthly functional tests consistentwith testing frequencies for identical trip units in other applicationsrequired by Technical Specifications. Additionally, this change does notinvolve a design change or physical change and therefore, does not changethe system function or operation as previously described in the GGNS UFSAR.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The change to the mode applicability of the HPSP is consistentwith system design and function. The HPSP actuates at or before 70% powerand functions to implement more stringent controls on rod withdrawal thanoperation below the HPSP but above the LPSP. Requiring HPSP operabilityprior to reaching or exceeding the Low Power Setpoint ensures proper functioningwhen required without unnecessary restrictions, therefore maintaining theoverall system operation as assumed in the UFSAR. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Thus, no new or different accident scenario is introduced by thisrevised frequency of surveillance and clarification of applicability. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. This change would not involve a significant reduction in the marginof safety. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The margin of safety remains unaffected by the elimination of thedaily functional test.

License Condition 2.C(3) was satisfied by the licenseeby submittal of a report dated January 21, 1988. The June 21, 1988 applicationwould incorporate the conclusion of the January 21, 1988 report into TS3/4.7.14 which contains temperature limits, and associated remedial requirements,and Surveillance Requirements, for various plant areas that contain temperaturesensitive, safety related, electrical equipment. Exceeding the temperaturelimits of TS 3/4.7.14 could affect the qualified lifetime of safety-relatedelectrical equipment as defined in 10 CFR 50.49, ``Environmental qualificationof electric equipment important to safety for nuclear power plants.'' At the present time, TS 3/4.7.14 defines two temperature zones within containment:(1) Zone C-01, ``Inside Crane Wall - All Elevations,'' and (2) Zone C-02,``Outside Crane Wall - All Elevations.'' Both C-01 and C-02 have temperaturelimits of 120anddegrees; F.

The temperature limit for Zone C-03 would be 130anddegrees; F. The licenseehas recalculated the qualified lifetime of safety related electrical equipmentin Zone C-03 with acceptable results as described in the licensee's submittaldated January 21, 1988. The proposed change to TS 3/4.7.14 would not involve a significant increasein the probability of an accident previously evaluated since no changein plant equipment or operating modes are being undertaken. With regardto the consequences of accidents previously evaluated, the licensee's calculationsshow that the proposed temperature limits for proposed Zones C-01 throughC-04 will assure continued reliability for electrical equipment which iscredited for operation in existing safety analyses. In addition, sincesafety related equipment in proposed Zones C-01 through C-04 will continueto operate reliably, no new or different kind of accident will be credited.Finally, since no changes in the safety analyses will result from the proposedchange to the TS, no reduction in safety margins will occur.

The July8, 1988 changes were proposed to make allowances for the amount of boratedwater which is unavailable for injection and which was not accounted forin the May 20, 1988 submittal. The proposed amendment would change the Technical Specifications to supportthe Cycle 5 core reload to permit operation with the V-5 fuel assemblies,in addition to the Westinghouse Low Parasitic (LOPAR) assemblies remainingin the core from Cycle 4 and subsequent operating cycles with up to a fullcore of V-5 fuel. Design features of the V-5 fuel include assemblies withup to approximately 4.25 weight percent U-235, axial blankets, integralfuel burnable absorbers, intermediate flow mixers, reconstitutable topnozzles, and extended burnup capability. A debris filter bottom nozzle(DFBN) will be introduced to replace the standard V-5 bottom nozzle toreduce the possibility of fuel rod damage due to debris-induced fretting.Changes to the Technical Specifications are required due to the use ofthe V-5 fuel and use of the following analytical methods and assumptions:(1) The Improved Thermal Design Procedure (ITDP); (2) The WRB-1 and WRB-2 departure from nucleate boiling (DNB) correlations;(3) The BASH large break loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) model; (4) The NOTRUMP small break LOCA model; (5) The ANSI/ANS 5.1-1979 decay heat model for non-LOCA accidents and transients;(6) Relaxed Axial Offset Control (RAOC); (7) F<T2>Q</T2>(z) Surveillance; and (8) Analysis baseline changes as outlined in the May 20, 1988 submittal.As a result of the above, changes to the following Technical Specificationsare proposed: (1) Core Safety Limits (TS 2.1.1, Figure 2.1-1); (2) Reactor Coolant Flow Allowable Values (TS 3/4.2.3); (3) Overtemperature delta T Reactor Trip Setpoints (Table 2.2-1); (4) Overpower delta T Reactor Trip Setpoints (Table 2.2-1); (5) Shutdown Margin for Modes 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 3.1-3); (6) Moderator Temperature Coefficient (TS 3/4.1.1.3); (7) Rod Drop Time (TS 3.1.3.4); (8) Axial Flux Difference (TS 3/4.2.1); (9) Heat Flux Hot Channel Factor - F<T2>Q</T2>(z) (TS 3/4.2.2, Figure 3.2-2, TS 4.10.2); (10) Nuclear Enthalpy Rise Hot Channel Factor - F<T2>delta H</T2> (TS 3/4.2.3, Figure 3.2-3); (11) DNB Parameters (Table 3.2-1); (12) Reactor Trip(s) Response Time (Table 3.3-2); (13) ECCS Accumulator Water Volume Range (TS 3.5.1); (14) Borated Water Sources-Shutdown (TS 3.1.2.5); (15) Borated Water Sources for Modes 1-4 (TS 3.1.2.6); (16) Reactor Trip System Instrumentation (Table 2.2-1); (17) Allowances for Determination of Operability (Table 2.2-1); and (18) Charging Pump Flow Balance Surveillance (TS 4.5.2). Also, Figure 3.2-1, Axial Flux Limits as a Function of Rated Thermal Poweris proposed to be deleted. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee has evaluated the proposed changes associated with the transitionto V-5 fuel against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 andagainst the Commission guidance concerning application of this standard.The licensee has concluded that the proposed changes do not involve anysignificant hazard because: <ITAG tagnum="21">a. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedis not significantly increased. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The V-5 reload fuel assemblies are mechanically and hydraulicallycompatible with the current LOPAR fuel assemblies, control rods and reactorinternals interfaces. Also, implementation of V-5 does not cause a significantchange in the physics characteristics of the VCSNS cores beyond the normalrange of variation seen from cycle to cycle. Thus, both fuel types satisfythe design basis for the VCSNS as proposed for this amendment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Thimble plug removal has a negligible impact on the system and componentstructural adequacy but does cause core bypass flow to increase. The revisedcore thermal-hydraulic design and safety analysis, however, show that theDNB penalty due to removal of the thimble plug is more than offset by theincrease in DNB margin resulting from the use of the ITDP and V-5 fuel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes have been assessed from a core design and safetyanalysis standpoint. No increase in the probability of occurrence of anyaccident was identified but an extensive reanalysis, as described in theTransition Safety Evaluation, was required to demonstrate compliance tothe revised VCSNS Technical Specifications. These reanalyses applied methodswhich have been previously found acceptable by the NRC. The results, whichinclude transition core effects, show changes in consequences of accidentspreviously analyzed. However, the results are all clearly within pertinentacceptance criteria and demonstrate the plant's capability to operate safelyat 100% power. Thus, it is concluded that there is no significant increasein the consequences of an accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different typethan any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report is not created.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">These proposed changes do not significantly effect the overall methodand manner of VCSNS operation and can be accommodated without compromisingthe performance or qualification of safety-related equipment. Thus, thecreation of a new or different kind of accident from any previously evaluatedaccident is not considered a possibility. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The margins (sic) of safety as defined in the bases for TechnicalSpecifications is not significantly reduced. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The evaluations and analyses described herein show some changes inthe consequences of previously analyzed accidents. In some cases, an increasein event consequences occurs and may reduce margin. However, in all cases,the results of the changes are clearly within all pertinent design andsafety acceptance criteria. Thus, there is no significant reduction inthe margin of safety as a result of the proposed changes. </ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. The staff has concluded that while the margins have beenreduced and event consequences have been increased, these impacts are insignificantbecause: (1) the core reload uses V-5 fuel which is not significantly differentfrom previous cores at the Summer Station; (2) the changes to the TechnicalSpecifications are as a result of the core reload and not because of anysignificant change made to the acceptance criteria for Technical Specifications;and (3) the analytical methods used in the required reload analysis havebeen previously found acceptable by the NRC. Therefore, the staff agreeswith the conclusion of the licensee's determination. Accordingly, the Commissionproposes to determine that these changes do not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Fairfield County Library,Garden and Washington Streets, Winnsboro, South Carolina 29180 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Randolph R.

This analysis assumes that containment purge is isolated5.5 seconds after the postulated break.

The change is to revise Table 3.6-1, ``Bypass LeakagePaths to the Auxiliary Building,'' to add four potential bypass leakagepaths associated with the penetrations for the hydrogen analyzer system.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>In its amendment request, TVA provided the following discussion onthe proposed change: <ITAG tagnum="21">During the review of a design change notice (DCN) issued to enhancethe hydrogen analyzer calibration process, it was discovered that the currentsystem design contained a potential pathway for the release of radionuclidesto the environment following a postulated loss of coolant accident (LOCA).Previously, the hydrogen analyzer system was considered a closed systemwith respect to containment isolation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This proposed technical specification change is needed for unit 1to identify the bypass leakage paths to the Auxiliary Building. Inclusionof these potential leakage paths in table 3.6-1 of the unit 1 technicalspecifications ensures that these bypass leakage paths are tested in accordancewith 10 CFR 50, Appendix J, and specification 3.6.1.2. This change is similarto a previously approved technical specification change (87-46) for unit2 that was submitted to NRC on March 1, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Modifications to the unit 1 hydrogen analyzer system are being performedto eliminate the potential bypass leakage to the environment. In orderto comply with specification 3.6.4.1 for operable hydrogen analyzers, theunit 1 modifications will be completed before entering mode 2. These deficiencieswere also reported to NRC in Licensee Event Report (LER) 327/87077. </ITAG>The Commission has provided Standards for determining whether a significanthazards determination exists in 10 CFR 50.92(c). 10 CFR 50.91 requiresthat at the time a licensee requests an amendment, it must provide to theCommission its analyses, using the standards in Section 50.92, on the issueof no significant hazards consideration. Therefore, in accordance with10 CFR 50.91 and 10 CFR 50.92, the licensee has provided the followinganalysis: <ITAG tagnum="21">TVA has evaluated the proposed technical specification change andhas determined that it does not represent significant hazards considerationbased on criteria established in 10 CFR 50.92(c). Operation of SQN in accordancewith the proposed amendment will not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated. The addition of the hydrogen analyzersystem bypass penetrations to table 3.6-1 ensures that the penetrationsare properly tested in accordance with [TS] surveillance requirement 4.6.1.2.e.This testing does not affect the probability or consequences of previouslyevaluated accidents. The hydrogen analyzer system is not required to mitigatedesign basis events but is used to provide post-LOCA [post-Loss-of-CoolantAccident] information to the operator in compliance with NUREG-0737. Thehydrogen analyzer system does not contribute to the probability of leakagepaths from containment to the environment. The remaining potential bypassleakage paths are into the ABSCE [Auxiliary Building Secondary ContainmentEnclosure] and are included in table 3.6-1 as such. Eliminating the leakagepaths to the environment will decrease the consequences of an accident.The offsite dose analysis of record (Final Safety Analysis Report, section15.5.3) is not affected by moving the potential release point of the hydrogenanalyzer system from the annulus to the ABSCE. This is because the totalprimary containment leakage remains unchanged, as do the assumptions that75 percent of the leakage is to the annulus and 25 percent of the leakageis to the Auxiliary Building. The change in potential release points onlychanges the allowable leakage for each individual penetration. The changedoes not impact systems or components used to mitigate postulated accidents.The probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidents has notbeen altered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accidentfrom any previously analyzed. The inclusion of the hydrogen analyzer systembypass penetrations in table 3.6-1 identifies the penetrations as beingwithin the scope of surveillance requirement 4.6.1.2.e. The leak rate testingrequired by this surveillance does not create the possibility of a newtype of accident. The changes made to the hydrogen analyzer system do notaffect the function or operation of the system. The changes are made toeliminate potential leakage paths from containment to the environment.The change does not adversely affect other systems; therefore, no new accidentscenarios are created. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The proposedchange ensures that the hydrogen analyzer system bypass penetrations areroutinely tested under the requirements of surveillance requirement 4.6.1.2.e.This testing ensures that the plant is bounded by the offsite dose analysisof record. As described above, the offsite dose analysis of record is notaffected by the proposed change; and the margin of safety as defined bythe technical specification bases is not changed. The modifications tothe hydrogen analyzer system eliminate a potential bypass leakage pathto the environment and bring the system into compliance with containmentisolation requirements. Any leakage will be into the ABSCE where it isprocessed by ABGTS [Auxiliary Building Gas Treatment System]. The technicalspecification change is made to reflect the potential bypass leakage pathsto the Auxiliary Building. Because the potential for unprocessed bypassleakage is eliminated, the actual margin of safety is increased. </ITAG>The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

The Commission has determined foreach of these amendments that the application for the amendment complieswith the standards and requirements of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, asamended (the Act), and the Commission's rules and regulations. The Commissionhas made appropriate findings as required by the Act and the Commission'srules and regulations in 10 CFR Chapter I, which are set forth in the licenseamendment. Because of exigent or emergency circumstances associated with the datethe amendment was needed, there was not time for the Commission to publish,for public comment before issuance, its usual 30-day Notice of Considerationof Issuance of Amendment and Proposed No Significant Hazards ConsiderationDetermination and Opportunity for a Hearing. For exigent circumstances,the Commission has either issued a <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice providing opportunity for public commentor has used local media to provide notice to the public in the area surroundinga licensee's facility of the licensee's application and of the Commission'sproposed determination of no significant hazards consideration. The Commissionhas provided a reasonable opportunity for the public to comment, usingits best efforts to make available to the public means of communicationfor the public to respond quickly, and in the case of telephone comments,the comments have been recorded or transcribed as appropriate and the licenseehas been informed of the public comments. In circumstances where failure to act in a timely way would have resulted,for example, in derating or shutdown of a nuclear power plant or in preventionof either resumption of operation or of increase in power output up tothe plant's licensed power level, the Commission may not have had an opportunityto provide for public comment on its no significant hazards determination.In such case, the license amendment has been issued without opportunityfor comment. If there has been some time for public comment but less than30 days, the Commission may provide an opportunity for public comment.If comments have been requested, it is so stated. In either event, theState has been consulted by telephone whenever possible. Under its regulations, the Commission may issue and make an amendment immediatelyeffective, notwithstanding the pendency before it of a request for a hearingfrom any person, in advance of the holding and completion of any requiredhearing, where it has determined that no significant hazards considerationis involved. The Commission has applied the standards of 10 CFR 50.92 and has made afinal determination that the amendment involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The basis for this determination is contained in the documentsrelated to this action. Accordingly, the amendments have been issued andmade effective as indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, the Commission has determined that these amendmentssatisfy the criteria for categorical exclusion in accordance with 10 CFR51.22. Therefore, pursuant to 10 CFR 51.22(b), no environmental impactstatement or environmental assessment need be prepared for these amendments.If the Commission has prepared an environmental assessment under the specialcircumstances provision in 10 CFR 51.12(b) and has made a determinationbased on that assessment, it is so indicated. For further details with respect to the action see (1) the applicationfor amendment, (2) the amendment to Facility Operating License, and (3)the Commission's related letter, Safety Evaluation and/or EnvironmentalAssessment, as indicated. All of these items are available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 1717 H Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.A copy of items (2) and (3) may be obtained upon request addressed to theU.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Director,Division of Reactor Projects. The Commission is also offering an opportunity for a hearing with respectto the issuance of the amendments. By September 9, 1988, the licensee mayfile a request for a hearing with respect to issuance of the amendmentto the subject facility operating license and any person whose interestmay be affected by this proceeding and who wishes to participate as a partyin the proceeding must file a written petition for leave to intervene.Requests for a hearing and petitions for leave to intervene shall be filedin accordance with the Commission's ``Rules of Practice for Domestic LicensingProceedings'' in 10 CFR Part 2. If a request for a hearing or petitionfor leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commission or anAtomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission or by theChairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will rule on therequest and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated Atomic Safetyand Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriate order.As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceedingand how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter, and the bases for each contentionset forth with reasonable specificity. Contentions shall be limited tomatters within the scope of the amendment under consideration. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. Since the Commission has made a final determination that the amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration, if a hearing is requested,it will not stay the effectiveness of the amendment. Any hearing held wouldtake place while the amendment is in effect.
