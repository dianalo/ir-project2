A General Accounting Office study of the department's ForeignService found that despite advances for minorities and white women,the numbers are low when compared to the civilian labor force.   ``The State Department increased minority representation in theForeign Service from 7 percent in 1981 to 11 percent in 1987,'' saidthe study, required by the Foreign Service Authorization Act. ``Thepercentage of white women has remained essentially unchanged atabout 24 percent.''   ``Minorities and women are still significantly under representedat senior levels of the Foreign Service,'' said the report, releasedTuesday.   The report produced no immediate comment from the StateDepartment, which is already under orders from a federal court inWashington to offer new positions to 600 women and to revamp itsentrance examination.   Although it doesn't mention the lawsuit, the report echoes itscomplaints.   As of September 1987, 6,166 of the State Department's 9,439Foreign Service employees were white men, the study said. Whitewomen accounted for 2,232 of the employees. There were also 508black men and women, 324 Hispanics, 42 American Indians or Alaskannatives, and 159 Asian-Americans or Pacific islanders, the studysaid.   The study noted that white males dominated the political andeconomic jobs, both considered more prestigious. Women of allbackgrounds tended to work as consular officers _ people who work onvisas, help Americans overseas, and issue passports. Most minoritymales become administrative officers _ the people in charge ofbudgets, maintenance and supplies, the study said.   The study found a particular problem at the mid-level ForeignService for white women, saying there should be 771 women in thosepositions while in fact there are 311.   ``If the promotion rates of white women continue at the currentlevels ... it could be several years before the State Departmentachieves full representation at these levels,'' the study said.   The State Department stopped hiring white women from outside intothe mid-level positions in 1987.   The study noted that State's recruiting efforts have notincreased the number of minorities taking the Foreign Serviceexamination for officer positions, and it said minority men andwomen pass the examination at one-fourth the rate of white men.   It suggested more innovative approaches, including a more activepresence on college campuses.   The State Department, in a letter that was part of the GAOreport, said it would alter its five-year affirmative action plan tocome up with specific goals and timetables for the hiring andadvancement of minorities.   It said its revamping of the examination would ensure that thereis no bias against women or minorities.   Charles Schmitz, vice president of the 20,000-member AmericanForeign Service Association, said the problem will be to come upwith a test that doesn't discriminate _ or show ``cultural bias'' _but assures that the people who represent the United States have ``ashared body of knowledge.''</TEXT></DOC>
