ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``So you're Colonel North?''   It was a question that did not need to be asked, but he answeredanyway, as laughter swept the crowded courtroom.   ``Yes, I am.''   ``It's traditional to start with your name,'' said his lawyer.   ``Oliver Laurence-with-a-U North,'' said the defendant.   In nearly two months of testimony, North had been depicted as ahard-charging Marine lieutenant colonel who single-handedlysupplied a rebel army, raised millions of dollars, supervised armsshipments to Iran, deceived Congress and violated its laws, and ingeneral was a loose cannon who was viewed with some suspicion byhis colleagues at the National Security Council.   On the witness stand, speaking softly to a jury that must decidehis fate, he appeared as an earnest, soft-spoken middle-aged manwith gray hair, who insisted he only acted to keep the Nicaraguancontras alive until Congress once again favored them with money tofight their battle.   He didn't ask for the assignment on the NSC, he said; in fact,``I told everyone along the line I wanted to go back to the Marineswhere my talents lie.''   He was just another of a number of political-military affairsofficers t the NSC charged with coordinating things in their areas.His orders came from two successive national security advisers,Robert C. McFarlane, a former Marine, and John M. Poindexter, athree-star admiral in the Navy. And his relationship with the lateCIA director William Casey was not as friend or buddy, but as ``asubordinate to a superior.''   He said he wanted to go back to the Marines after his three-yeartour at the NSC was up but McFarlane said, ``Look, there's muchmore than being a battalion commander,'' even though that's what hewanted to be.   Nearly two years ago, North took a witness's oath in a hearingroom on Capitol Hill, his hair cropped to proper Marine-officerlength with six rows of ribbons on his chest attesting to adistinguished military record. In court, the hair still was short,but the uniform now was civilian dark blue suit, red and bluestriped tie and white shirt. He said ``yes, sir'' and ``no, sir,''often.   Most of the time his hands were folded on the small table infront of the witness chair. But they became animated when hetalked, first, about his family, and then his NSC job.   Married to Betsy, sitting in the front row, 26 years. Four``lovely'' children, the oldest 19, the youngest eight today.Father was in U.S. Army, mother a school teacher. Educated inpublic and Catholic schools. U.S. Naval Academy, commissioned in1968 as a Marine second lieutenant.   He did the things young Marine officers did, he said. In thesummer he volunteered for jump school at Ft. Benning, Ga. He didsome boxing and even, sometimes, ``was lucky enough to win.''   North quickly hurried over his Vietnam service. He was ``inabout 100 engagements, I guess.'' Earned the Silver Star, theBronze Star, the Navy Commendation Medal, the Navy AchievementMedal, a couple of purple hearts.   He had an opportunity in court that he didn't get on CapitolHill: he gave the jury the same slide show about Central Americathat he gave 75 to 100 times while on the NSC to as few as threepeople and as many as several hundred.   For the jury he lectured in the same pained voice as when h'slecturing for $20,000 a throw.   ``The Soviet policy goal is to create turmoil in the Caribbeanbasin. ... The Soviet Union in this hemisphere is outspending us4-1. ... Between the Rio Grande and Panama 100 million people arethreatened. ... In Nicaragua in 1985 was the largest standing armythat's ever been seen in Central America.''   Pictures of Contras. ``These people have become the Nicaraguanresistance. ... They didn't get drafted, they volunteered.''   And so the drama played before a jury that appeared to pay moreattention than any time before in the trial.</TEXT></DOC>
