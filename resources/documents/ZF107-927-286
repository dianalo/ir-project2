Broadbent, Treasury's deputy assistantsecretary for information systems, said he is not opposed to supplying theinformation as long as IRMS does not challenge Treasury's right to decide whoshould manage the projects.andM;IRMS officials recently asked Treasury for information on senior staffassigned to its Automated Collection ADP maintenance procurement, which is toresult in a contract for software and maintenance services for installedHoneywell equipment.andM;The request &quot;wasn't regarded as an issue in Treasury,&quot; Broadbent said.andP;  &quot;Butour general reaction is we're not in favor of creating another step ofmicro-management.andP;  We have a professional staff quite capable of judging whois qualified and who is not.andP;  We don't want a person with 20 years ofexperience for an off-the-shelf buy.andP;  We're clearly in the position of makingthe proper decision,&quot; he said.andM;IRMS also asked Agriculture for data on contracting officials procuring arelational database management system for use on mainframe at the NationalFinance Center in New Orleans and the National Computer Center in KansasCity, Mo.andM;Glenn Haney, director of Agriculture's IRM Office, said he had no problemswith the request because his agency uses a parallel review process thatinvolves working with GSA oversight officials at each stage of a procurement.andM;However, Haney said some agency officials may be afraid that IRMS is tryingto asset too much control.andM;&quot;GSA is saying we feel we should have some assurances that you have trainedpeople&quot; in charge, Haney said.andP;  &quot;We have no concern sharing with thembackground information as long as we retain the right to select who runs theproject.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
