But Alistair Cooke, who is both, reports one problemwhen young reporters arrive to interview him:   ``I am at the stage where I ask, `Does the name Adolf Hitlermean anything to you?'''   Despite this gentle reminder that those who forget history aredoomed to see it repeated on cable, Cooke has prevailed inbroadcasting and will take due note of it early in the new year -on Jan. 13, to be precise.   He'll celebrate his 20th anniversary then as host of PBS'``Masterpiece Theatre,'' commencing a nine-week retrospective ofsome of its better-known dramatic bundles from Britain. But ofcourse they include ``Upstairs, Downstairs,'' ``I, Claudius,'' and``The Jewel in the Crown.''   If that's not enough, PBS will offer a Jan. 24 parody of theseries, ``Masterpiece Tonight,'' concocted by Gerard Alessandrini,whose ``Forbidden Broadway'' here regularly applies the needle toBroadway musicals.   A transplanted Englishman who gives urbane a good name, Cookehas been the only host of ``Masterpiece Theatre'' since it began onJan. 10, 1971 with ``The First Churchills'' - one of hisleast-favorite shows, incidentally.   An elegant man, he favors blue blazers, gray slacks, and thegraceful turn of phrase. Also jazz piano.   Born in Manchester, and a U.S. citizen since 1941, he first camehere as a student in 1932. He returned as a man of print andbroadcast who since 1938 has tried to explain America to theBritish, no mean feat.   In 1970, he embarked upon an even more difficult feat -explaining America to the Americans - in his acclaimed ``America''series, a BBC co-production that NBC aired in prime time in1972-73. The show won four Emmies.   But it also almost prevented him from signing up for``Masterpiece Theatre.'' He was in Boston, filming the third``America'' episode, when accosted by a young British producer,Christopher Sarson.   The ``Masterpiece'' idea - hosting a weekly series of Britishdramas adapted from famous novels - was explained. Cooke beggedoff, saying he'd be tied up on ``America'' for two years andconstantly travelling.   But Sarson ``was a deadpan scoundrel - and terrificallypersuasive,'' he said.   A veteran America-watcher whose dossier of pals and influencesincludes H.L. Mencken, Cooke will celebrate another milestone inMarch.   That will be his 45th anniversary of commenting on his adoptedcountry's wild and sometimes disturbing ways in ``Letter FromAmerica,'' a 14-minute weekly report he delivers on radio for theBBC.   Heard via short-wave in 52 countries, including this one, helikens what he calls ``my talks'' to ``a diary, in a way, writtenfor a friend.''   He comments on whatever strikes his fancy, sad or funny, minuteor of great import and consequence (he does admit, gently laughing,that he has yet to give the once-over to Madonna and her amazingmondo video).   It's his proud semiboast that in all the years of ``Letter'' hehasn't missed a week, although ``we came damn close a few monthsago'' when he had to go to a hospital here for a prostateoperation.   Arrangements were made for him to tape that week's show in thehospital's boardroom. They rolled him there in a wheelchair,accompanied by two public relations officials, ``both stunning,''from the hospital.   He recalls telling them, ``What a pity we didn't have aphotographer with us. It's the first time in 44 years that I'vebroadcast with a catheter bag.''   As befits a man of his years and travels, he occasionally isasked to compare the America of, say, 1940, with the America oftoday. Given the chance to go cosmic, he instead offers arefreshing, unexpected answer.   ``I couldn't do it,'' he says. ``The standard thing is to talkabout the loss of innocence. Every generation thinks it wasinnocent when it was young. It wasn't innocent. It was young.''   He smiles when asked when, if ever, he'll sign off the air andretire.   ``Oh, it may happen tomorrow. I live from day to day, and it'snot for me to decide that. But I don't have any intention of doingthat. I think when you retire, you keel over.''   ---   Elsewhere in television ...   SHOULD AULD ACQUAINTANCE BE FORGOT, IT'S FOR A DARN GOOD REASON:The usual New Year's shows are loose on the networks starting at11:30 p.m. EST tonight. CBS has ``Happy New Year America, 1991,''hosted by Melissa Manchester and featuring Terry Bradshaw in TimesSquare. That's where NBC's Jane Pauley also will be as part of alive ``Tonight'' guest-hosted by Jay Leno. Yet another star, DickClark, is checking in from Times Square for ``Dick Clark's NewYear's Rockin' Eve '91.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Dec 31</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
