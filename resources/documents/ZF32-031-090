Johnson led the company into theexploration of magnetic storage systems.andP;  Johnson's IBM researchlaboratory team in San Jose explored magnetic drums, tape loops,tape strip bins, and wires and rods.andP;  In 1953, the team focused onrotating magnetic drums and applied that knowledge and research onfile applications to a procurement the company had won with theAir Force.andP;  The goal was to supply the department with ageneral-purpose random-access device that could offer instantaccess to each of the Air Force's 50,000-item inventory records.andO;IBM's specifications for the project led two years later to theRAMAC 350 disk, but the research team first had to discover amethod for uniformly and smoothly coating the disks withiron-oxide paint.andP;  The team went beyond the original Air Forcespecifications and by 1956 introduced the first RAMAC machine.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   International Business Machines Corp.
