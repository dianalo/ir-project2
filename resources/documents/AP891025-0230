But, as happens eventually to everything in the world ofcreative finance, the notion has been abused. Rather than financingsound enterprises, junk bonds often became vehicles for the pursuitof greed, power and fanciful schemes.   They have made certain individuals enormously and quicklywealthy. They have put once-sound companies on the edge offinancial disaster. They have thwarted the growth of manycompanies, and they've all but destroyed others.   They have also shattered the dreams of many of those who boughtthem in expectation of big profits, because now they must sit andwait and wonder if the companies in which they invested will everbe able to repay them.   Default rates are rising, and conceivably could mount into stillanother national financial disaster should a deep recession occur.   There are about $200 billion of them out there, and they arewidely held. If a recession should occur it could ruin someoverleveraged companies and destroy values in pension funds,stocks, mutual funds and college endowments.   Short of a recession, there still could be serious problems forholders. The junk bond market isn't as liquid as other markets;there is no assurance that buyers are out there at any given time.Given that, prices could fall.   Several large issuers of junk bonds already are in default,among them Dart Drug Stores and LTV, while others are in deeptrouble: Griffen Resorts, Seaman Furniture, Resorts Internationaland Integrated Resources.   Defaults and moratoriums total $4 billion this year. Thenation's largest retailing empire, Campeau Corp., has come apartonly a year after it was put together with junk financing. Otherissuers survive by selling off parts.   The picture needn't be painted entirely in somber tones of gray,however, because some companies are bound to thrive, continue topay the high interest on their bonds and still have enough left inthe kitty to finance growth.   Growth is the secret by which issuers of junk bonds hope to castoff the burden of debt, but that growth has to be vigorous. Withinmonths, some issuers have discovered that the growth theyenvisioned just wasn't there.   When that happens, the company must think of cannibalizingitself, or selling off parts to meet financial obligations. But theconsequence of that is often to further erode growth, thusthreatening a downward spiral.   Prime Computer Inc., a Massachusetts computer maker that wentfrom sales of about $8.5 million in 1978 to about $1 billion 10years later, was acquired in a leveraged buyout earlier this yearfor $1.3 billion cash and junk bonds.   With its growth record, its products, its reputation and itsability to keep abreast of developments in its field, Primeappeared to be a safe risk, a company capable of generating enoughcash to keep bondholders happy.   This week the new owners of Prime, J.H. Whitney andamp; Co., sought toslash costs by dismissing 2,500 workers, or 20 percent of Prime'spayroll, setting off speculation in the industry about thecompany's future.   If Prime cannot support good workers, how will it support goodproducts? Can it service its customers? Gain new ones? Can itcreate new products to match the innovative equipment from itsvigorous competitors?   Conceivably, Prime could get its big bills paid down in four orfive years, and then turn its energies to growth and greaterprofitability. But until then, it will be carrying an interest-rateburden that's like a dead-weight anchor.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Wed, Oct 25</NOTE></DOC>
