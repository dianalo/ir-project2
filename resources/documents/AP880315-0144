The six-member jury also awarded $350,000 to the child's mother,Marlene Canty.   The jury had ruled Jan. 15 that the baby was conscious enough toexperience pain and suffering, but city lawyers argued that thefinding was medically impossible and said they would appeal.   Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Kenneth Shorter refused on Feb.29 to overturn the verdict, the Daily News said Tuesday.   Mrs. Canty, then 21, went into labor in her home two monthsearly on April 24, 1975. Her husband, Winslow, called the EmergencyMedical Service at least once, possibly three times, according toconflicting accounts.   The baby, still in its amniotic sac and moving one appendage,``lay between the mother's thighs visible to her during the alleged45-minute delay and negligent treatment ...,'' the judge wrote inhis decision.   Mrs. Canty said the EMS technician who finally arrived told herthe baby was dead and refused to open the sac.   ``Finally I asked her (the technician) if the baby was a boy ora girl,'' Mrs. Canty said. ``At that point she took a smallinstrument and slit open the sac. ... She lifted one leg, saw thegender of the baby, threw the leg down and said the baby was a boy.... She then picked up the baby, wrapped the baby in the plasticand threw the baby'' into a cardboard box.   Mrs. Canty and the baby were taken to Harlem Hospital, where theinfant lived for 24 hours on a respirator.</TEXT></DOC>
