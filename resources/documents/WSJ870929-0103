Despite touted remedies and precautions, it strikes every year and no cure is in sight.    Medical expenses in 1987 are again expected to far outpace the general rate of inflation. Data Resources Inc., a Lexington, Mass.-based forecaster, estimates that medical prices will rise 6.7% this year, compared with an estimated 3.9% increase in the consumer price index. Although the margin has narrowed from last year -- when health-care expenses increased more than six times the general inflation rate of 1.1% -- efforts to slow the rise in medical costs have failed.    &quot;Overall, we've been unsuccessful in holding the line on costs,&quot; says Eli Ginzberg, a Columbia University professor emeritus of economics. &quot;We've been talking a good line, but I don't see any evidence of any significant containment.&quot;    Instead, total health-care spending this year should top $500 million, up 6.8% from 1986. Moreover, health expenses this year are expected to climb to about 11.3% of the gross national product, compared with 10.9% a year ago and 9.1% in 1980. In five years, that share of the GNP is expected to rise above 13%.    Some economists compare the attempts at controlling medical costs to squeezing a balloon -- pushing down costs in one area has merely caused them to expand elsewhere. Tighter rules on hospitalizations, for instance, have reduced patient stays. But at the same time, the boom in outpatient care -- largely unregulated -- has been much more expensive than expected, and the average cost of hospitalization has soared.    Economists and medical industry officials cite a number of factors for the failure of cost containment. Some are beyond anybody's control; the aging U.S. population, for example, is pushing up the demand for medical care. The use of more expensive medical procedures, increases in the treatment of mental health problems -- including drug and alcohol abuse -- and higher prices for prescription drugs also have sharply added to medical costs.    Moreover, many of the cost-containment steps taken in recent years apparently had only a passing effect. Although the increase in medical prices slowed in 1984 -- the year many doctors voluntarily froze fees at the request of the American Medical Association -- price increases have made up for lost ground since then.    Still, some regulators and medical professionals say the steps that have been taken to control costs will slow price increases in the long run. &quot;The picture isn't totally bleak,&quot; says Glenn Hackbarth, deputy administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which oversees the federal Medicaid program. &quot;I'm optimistic that some of the changes we're seeing, like the growth of (health-maintenance organizations), have laid the groundwork for future improvements.&quot; Health-maintenance organizations tend to offer less expensive care than traditional methods.    For now, however, health-care inflation seems unlikely to abate. One big reason: Physicians' fees, which account for 20% of total medical costs, rose 7.8% last year, and are expected to continue increasing at a much higher rate than general inflation. To bring in more revenue, many doctors have begun charging for services they previously provided free, such as telephone consultations and extra visits. Also, use of the &quot;superbill&quot; -- a hospital form on which physicians merely check off specific services rendered from a long list of possible services -- is said to have encouraged charging for procedures such as minor lab tests that wouldn't have always been included under previous billing methods.    Meanwhile, doctors' expenses have continued to rise. The cost of malpractice insurance, for instance, has climbed as much as 40% annually in recent years for some specialists. And because more patients are treated in doctors' offices instead of hospitals, physicians say their costs have gone up as they've added more technology, staff and space to handle new in-office tests and procedures.    Doctors are &quot;delivering more services per episode of illness,&quot; says Uwe Reinhardt, a health-care economist at Princeton University. &quot;Ten years ago, if you had a headache your doctor might just prescribe something. Now he can do a (computerized tomagraphic) scan and prescribe something.&quot; Such a head scan typically costs $300 to $350.    In a way, the increase in costs is ironic; in most industries, technological advances result in lower costs. But in medicine, advances traditionally have been directed more at improving care than reducing expenses. Thus, new methods for treating patients often significantly add to the expense. Medical economists say that, if anything, this industry tendency has become even more pronounced recently.    For instance, magnetic resonance, or MRI scans, give physicians amazingly detailed pictures of the body's interior, reducing the need for exploratory surgery. Although such technological advances may lower costs in individual cases, their frequent use has contributed to higher costs overall, economists say. Medical imaging devices such as computerized tomagraphic scanners and magnetic resonance imaging machines cost as much as $2 million.    &quot;There are more medical miracles today than leveraged buyouts,&quot; says Ralph Muller, president of the University of Chicago Medical Center. &quot;It's all expensive but the public sentiment is for it, and politicians and insurers won't stand in the way of that.&quot;    The technological advances also have enabled doctors to treat more patients with so-called catastrophic illnesses or injuries, which can cost more than $100,000 a patient. &quot;When I was practicing as a surgeon 10 years ago, if a 70-year old came in with an aneurysm, a weakening of the vessel wall in the aorta, we might not operate. There was a cutoff where the risks outweighed the benefits,&quot; says James S. Todd, senior deputy executive vice president of the American Medical Association. &quot;But the technology is there now to allow us to operate with less risk. And a 70-year-old today is much healthier than a 70-year-old 10 years ago.&quot;    Another obstacle to cost containment has been the increase in spending on mental-health problems, including drug and alcohol abuse. Allen Haight, a vice president in Prudential Insurance Co.'s group insurance business, says such claims have climbed to 20% of Prudential's total spending on health claims, from 8% five years ago, making it the fastest growing part of the company's medical claim expense.    A major difficulty in holding down the cost of mental-health care is the uncertainty of diagnosis and treatment. &quot;It's ill-defined,&quot; says Mr. Reinhardt. &quot;It's not like a hip-replacement that you know needs to be done. It's just extremely hard to know how much to do.&quot;    Meanwhile, price increases for pharmaceuticals have largely exceeded the general inflation rate. In the first half of this year, prescription drug prices rose 6.8%, following a 9% increase for all of last year. The industry attributes the recent increases mainly to escalating research-and-development costs, which can total $125 million for a single drug before the product can be marketed. In current dollars, such costs a decade ago would have totaled less than $100 million. Smithkline Beckman Corp., for example, last year increased the price of its Tagamet anti-ulcer medication 20% to cover the &quot;spiraling costs&quot; of research and development for new drugs.    Despite such increases, some in the medical industry question whether the concern about increased health-care spending is exaggerated. &quot;We can get all carried away about the costs,&quot; says Robert Filip, manager of marketing and sales communications for General Electric Co.'s medical systems division, &quot;but when push comes to shove, if I or you got sick, we'd want the best care available.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
