The index rebounded sharply to close at 388.62, up 2.86 from Wednesday.    Volume was robust, but down slightly from the previous session. About 132.7 million shares were traded, 90.7 million of which were on the National Market System, where Nasdaq's major stocks trade.    Among over-the-counter industry indexes, the utility group performed best, soaring 5.52 to 484.04. Two big utilities, SouthernNet and MCI Communications, were up and topped Nasdaq's most-active list.    The market's vigor pleased traders. But few were willing to declare the beginning of a trend. &quot;One up day does not a bull market make,&quot; said William R. Rothe, head of OTC trading at Alex. Brown andamp; Sons, Baltimore. &quot;I don't think that terribly volatile markets are viewed positively by investors.&quot;    Mr. Rothe and other over-the-counter market watchers have said that the market won't resume its pre-crash robustness until institutional investors re-embrace Nasdaq issues, particularly its largest technology stocks.    Though many issues in the group lately haven't been battered as much as they were for much of the summer, their performance continues to be mixed.    Said Mr. Rothe: &quot;We do see decent volume in selected issues, but, the over-the-counter market still is unforgiving of bad news. I would like to see more sustained, positive action coupled with continued good earnings performance.&quot;    Nevertheless, he and others were cheered by the strong performances of several big technology stocks.    Sun Microsystems jumped 2 1/4 to 32 7/8 on 1.5 million shares after reporting sharply higher net income for the third quarter. Apple was up 1 1/2 to 41 1/2 on about equal volume. Intel rose 1 1/8 to 27 1/2 in heavy trading; MCI Communications, the second most-active issue, gained 7/8 to 23 1/2. Also, Micron Technology, Information Resources and Lotus Development were up slightly in active trading.    Another technology stock advanced on favorable news. Quantum leaped 1 3/8 to 13 5/8 after the disk-drive maker said it will repurchase as many as two million shares of its common stock in a Dutch auction for between $13.25 and $14.75 a share.    Anticipation of good news from Ashton-Tate sent its shares higher. The software services concern's stock was up 1 to 26. In an interview, a spokesman for the company confirmed that next Monday it will announce a business agreement with Digital Equipment, but wouldn't be more specific. Analysts speculated that it involves relational databases. The spokesman also said the company still doesn't know when it will ship its DBase IV software.    The day's most active stock, SouthernNet, rose 1 1/8 to 19 3/8. The Atlanta-based concern said Langstone Investment sold its 10.6% stake to &quot;a number of institutional investors.&quot; In August, SouthernNet, a provider of 24-hour telephone service, said it would merge with Teleconnect Co., Cedar Rapids, Iowa. SouthernNet yesterday said it doesn't expect the sale to interfere with the merger.    Phoenix Medical Technology, which said it expects to report higher earnings this year and next, traded at almost 10 times its average daily volume. It closed down 1/8 to 16 1/8. Last year, the Andrews, S.C., medical-supply company earned $1.2 million, or 76 cents a share.    Shares of several issues that made news earlier in the week continued to trade actively. Telecredit tumbled 2 1/4 to 30 1/4. Liz Claiborne rose 1/2 to 18 3/8 and Perpetual Financial closed at 11 1/8, up 1/8. </TEXT></DOC>
