<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-71-0366 </DOCNO><TEXT>Most of the (low enthalpy) thermomineral waters from the Franco-ItalianAlps arise in fissured zones which promote mixing between deep waters,which are predominantly of the sodium chloride type, and intermediateand surface waters, which are mainly of the sulphate and/or calcium bicarbonatetype. The characteristics and the origins of the waters from the deepcirculations have been precisely determined by isotope analysis of thewater molecules themselves (/sup 3/H, /sup 2/H and /sup 18/O) and ofcertain dissolved compounds, such as the sulphates (/sup 34/S and /sup18/O), the sulphides (/sup 34/S) and of carbon dioxide or the bicarbonates(/sup 13/C, /sup 18/O). The meteoric origin of the deep waters was provedin this way. These waters are old and devoid of tritium; the age of oneof the sources (Saint-Vincent) was also confirmed using /sup 14/C. Wheregas is given off, the CO/sub 2/ was shown to be endogenous, with isotopeconcentrations similar to those found in the perialpine carbon dioxidegas belt. Isotope measurements on /sup 34/S proved concentrations tobe relatively uniform, which would indicate that the dissolved sulphatesmay have a common origin, having been flushed out of Permotriassic evaporites.Also, the /sup 18/O-/sup 34/S geothermometer confirms that these watersare not magmatic in origin, having temperatures of between 150 to 200deg. C which are in good agreement with the indications of other geothermometers.Nevertheless, the conventional geothermometers cannot be used in thiscontext. With a geothermal gradient of 3.3 deg. C per 100 m, the resultstend to indicate that the depth limit for these circulation pathwaysis at over 4000 m, which seems to strengthen the hypothesis that thereare, at great depths, residual thin layers of Triassic evaporites, asdeduced from the seismic profiles, or films of sodium chloride brinesbeneath the large, overlapping blocks of the platform.
