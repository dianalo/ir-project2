The company, based in New Orleans, said it will place 92.5million barrels of oil and gas reserves, plus some Texas realestate, into a new corporation. Its stock will be distributedto Freeport shareholders by mid-year and will trade publicly,the company said.</LP><TEXT>   Freeport also said its fourth-quarter net income rose to$12.9 million, or 17 cents a share, from $10.2 million, or 13cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue slid 4.9% to $369.3million from $388.5 million. The company changed itsaccounting methods and restated prior-year results.   Operating profit in the quarter actually fell 36% asprices declined for almost all its basic commodities --including oil, copper, gold, silver and phosphate fertilizersmade from sulfur. With the economy struggling and interestrates and inflation remaining low, the price outlook for mostcommodities is flat. Freeport has been able to survive byincreasing production and cutting costs.   Wall Street reacted enthusiastically to Freeport'schanges. In trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange,the stock was quoted at $44.125, up $2.625. A number of metalcompany stocks also rose yesterday, but &quot;the key thing is thecutting of long-term debt,&quot; said Marc Cohen, a securitiesanalyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in New York.   Freeport's long-term debt surged to $1.94 billion byyear-end 1991, in large part to pay for development of twobig natural-resource discoveries. The company has spent $500million on a copper and gold discovery in a vast tract inIndonesia. It will spend $475 million to $500 million for itsportion of a sulfur discovery in the Gulf of Mexico, wherethe company is building the largest platform in the historyof the Gulf. The sulfur project also produces oil and naturalgas that the company isn't spinning off.   To pay down some of the debt, Freeport said it will usethe current value of the oil and gas reserves it plans tospin off to arrange bank debt or other financing totaling$500 million.   Because of the heavy debt load, there had been rumors thatFreeport would cut both its regular quarterly dividend of37.5 cents a share and a special dividend of 25 cents aquarter. &quot;With this much debt reduced, it's a moot point,&quot;said Mr. Cohen, the Kidder analyst.   At one point last year, Freeport put up for sale all itsoil and gas reserves; but in today's horrendousdomestic-energy market, the company apparently didn't receiveoffers it deemed acceptable. Freeport said it has focused on&quot;exploration successes&quot; in its metals and agriculturalminerals operations. And it has &quot;significantly reduced . . .oil and natural gas exploration efforts because of the bleakoutlook for oil and natural gas prices.&quot;   Freeport said it expects that shares of the new oil andgas corporation will have minimal value on the date ofdistribution because of the significant debt that will burdenthe assets. But it said the corporation, which won't explorefor new reserves, has &quot;excellent long-term value.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
