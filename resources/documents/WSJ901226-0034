Mr. Agnos met with business and union leaders lastSaturday and obtained general agreement to support sixamendments that limit the ordinance's scope. The amendedrules will be presented to the Board of Supervisors forapproval by Jan. 7, said Paul Chignell, a mayoral aide. Evenin its more-restricted version, the law, which the mayor saidhe will sign tomorrow, still is seen as a possible model forfuture legislation in other cities.</LP><TEXT>   As the use of VDTs has grown, a number of health problemshave been attributed to prolonged use of them. Carpal tunnelsyndrome, a painful wrist ailment; eye strain, lower-backstrain from poorly designed chairs, and concern about theeffects of low-level radiation emitted from the displays havebeen the subject of controversy between computer operatorsand their employers for a number of years.   The ordinance requires employers to provide workers withadjustable seats, monitors and keyboards; sets guidelines foreliminating screen glare; and requires regular 15-minutebreaks for workers and replacement of substandard equipment.   Under the amendments the mayor proposed, companies havefour years instead of the originally proposed two years toreplace substandard equipment. Companies will be required toretrofit substandard computer equipment within 30 months at acost of as much as $250 per machine. All new computerworkstations purchased within a year of the adoption of theDec. 17 ordinance will have to meet the new standards set bythe ordinance.   Workers at the Pacific Stock Exchange and operators ofcomputer-aided design and display machines -- used inarchitectural and other design-oriented industries -- areexempt under the new rules.</TEXT></DOC>
