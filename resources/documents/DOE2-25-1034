<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-1034 </DOCNO><TEXT>The reactions of iodomethane with a range of Australian coals at elevatedtemperatures (300-425 degrees C) in the presence and absence of hydrogenhave been investigated. High conversions (about 99%) and yields (59%)of oil products are obtained at pressures (6.9 MPa) and temperatures(400 degrees C) at which conventional liquefaction with donor vehicleproduces only a low-volatile tar. Several modes of action of the iodomethanehave been recognized. In the absence of hydrogen, the iodine in iodomethaneconverts hydroaromatics to aromatics at temperatures (300 degrees C)well before the coal pyrolysis temperature is reached. In the presenceof hydrogen, iodine-produced hydrogen radicals or associated speciespromote aromatic ring hydrogenation and cracking. Methyl groups in iodomethanealso react with the coal before pyrolysis, and many eventually becomeattached to the end of linear aliphatic chains and also to aromatic ringsin the product oil. These results clearly demonstrate that reactive additivescan alter the mechanism of coal liquefaction and thereby produce higheryields of volatile products than conventional procedures using similarconditions of temperature and pressure. 36 refs., 3 figs., 14 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
