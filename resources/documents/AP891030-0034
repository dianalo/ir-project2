With two months remaining in 1989, district police reported thatfive slayings discovered during a seven-hour period over theweekend brought the tally to last year's record death total.   Three of the weekend killings were linked to drugs. The othertwo were a 13-year-old girl and her aunt who were found stabbed todeath in their apartment Saturday.   Police blame more than 60 percent of the district's slayings ondrugs, particularly the arrival of crack cocaine.   The federal government is making the nation's capital a testcase for national anti-drug strategies, and city police are workinglong hours trying to curb drug-related violence.   ``It's awful. But people in this community are resorting todeadly violence to resolve conflict,'' said police spokesman Lt.Reginald Smith.   The most recent victim of the weekend was a 41-year-old manfound dead of multiple gunshot wounds early Sunday. He had $11,000cash and a large quantity of heroin in his pockets when his bodywas found, according to police detectives.   At the end of 1988, police had said 372 people were killed inhomicides, but they revised that number downward Sunday bysubtracting three victims of police shootings from the officialtotal.   D.C. Mayor Marion Barry, whose political fortunes are slippingpartly because the murder rate is skyrocketing, calls the problem``unstoppable.''   National Drug Policy Coordinator William J. Bennett acknowledgedrecently that the district's drug and crime problem _ the focus ofspecial attention from his office _ will be difficult to solve.   ``No one should be surprised to learn that the nation's capitalis still plagued by a serious drug problem,'' Bennett said whilereviewing federal efforts in the district's drug war. ``Thedrug-related murder rate is intolerably high, the prisons are toocrowded, drugs continue to be sold openly around schools, parks andhousing projects.''   Bennett has lent federal prison space, special agents andinvestigative tools to the city's anti-drug effort, and city policehave been working 12-hour shifts patrolling drug-infestedneighborhoods and housing projects.   But on Friday, President Bush vetoed the city's annual spendingbill, delaying a special $32 million federal anti-crime package.   By vetoing the bill because it would allow the city to use localtax money to finance Medicaid abortions for poor women, Bush put onhold a plan to hire 700 extra police, eight new judges, and a hostof school-based anti-drug educational programs.   ``We're going to have to study whether to cut out overtime,''Police Chief Isaac Fulwood said after the veto. ``Certainly, weneed to rethink purchasing strategies, and slow them down ... Thiscertainly won't help fight crime.''   Most city officials feel that until the city's appetite fordrugs subsides, there is little they can do.   ``The large percentage of the killings are related to the drugscene, and in many cases ... hits that are put out in argumentsover turf,'' said Barry spokeswoman Lurma Rackley. ``We can delaythem, but as long as the drug market is still thriving, thosetargeted killings are probably going to continue.''   Fulwood, who has contradicted Barry's negative view of themurder situation, said the situation isn't as bleak as the mayorsuggested.   ``We are making some progress, and there are some things thatare positive,'' Fulwood said. ``The number of killings, per day, isdecreasing. It's still too high, but we are going in the rightdirection.''   According to police statistics, 49 people were killed in thenation's capital during August, 32 in September, and 34 in October.Still, the September and October figures represent a murder a day.</TEXT></DOC>
