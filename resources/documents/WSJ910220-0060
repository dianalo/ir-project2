MCI's move seemed aimed at countering recent gains byAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. in the small-businessarena. But at least one analyst questioned the economics ofthe plan.</LP><TEXT>   The new service -- called MCI Preferred --is being offeredto firms that spend from $50 to $1,500 a month. MCI saidthere are roughly five million such businesses, which couldbe a professional office or home-based company, in the U.S.and that these firms spend some $6 billion annually onlong-distance services.   Under the plan small businesses will be able to receive asingle bill for all long-distance services -- includingtoll-free 800 service, calling-card and regular businesscalls -- as long as they get those services from MCI. MCI'scomputers will also tag each entry for quick allocation by acustomer's bookkeeping department.   Moreover, the customer will receive sizable discountsincluding up to $1,000 taken off its September bill if itsigns up before April 1; a 10% discount on all monthly billsin excess of $200; and an additional 10% discount on callsmade to the area code dialed most frequently by the customer.   One analyst questioned the prudence of spending so mucheffort on customers that run up such small bills. &quot;It doesn'timprove market share, but it does cannibalize MCI's existingrevenue by creating a new segment of customer that shouldn'texist,&quot; said Jack B. Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc.   &quot;We were a small business once and I would have loved tohave had these kinds of services,&quot; said William G. McGowan,MCI's chairman, adding that &quot;five million customers spending$6 billion a year&quot; are worth snaring.   Other features of MCI's Preferred service include itemizedbilling with name and address of the called party and atravel charge card that also allows a customer to tap intoservices such as voice mail, and conference calling.</TEXT></DOC>
