In HCM, left ventricularhypertrophy was localized to the septal wall in four, to the apical wallin two, to both the septal and apical walls in two, and to the apicaland inferior walls in one, and it was diffuse in seven patients. In hypertensives,LVH was localized to the septal wall in three, to both the septal andanterior walls in two, to the free wall in one, and it was diffuse ineight patients. The distribution of the hypertrophic portion was nearlyequal in both groups. The thickest portion of the left ventricular wallwas 24.6 +- 4.8 mm in HCM and 21.6 +- 5.4 mm in hypertension, and therewas no significant difference between them. The T/sub 2/ relaxation timeof the hypertrophic portion was 52.2 +- 4.8 msec in HCM and 45.3 +- 6.1msec in hypertension, and there was a significant difference betweenthem (p andless; 0.01). However, there were no significant differences betweenthe T/sub 2/ relaxation times of the hypertrophic and non-hypertrophicprotions in both groups. In conclusion, it may be difficult to differentiateHCM from hypertension based on the distribution of hypertrophic portions,but measurements of the T/sub 2/ relaxation times may be useful for makingthe differential diagnosis.</TEXT></DOC>
