Having already made clear its refusal to take in Hong KongChinese when the colony reverts to Chinese rule, the government isfacing additional public disapproval with its stance on the boatpeople.   Most of the 56,000 Vietnamese in Hong Kong are being held incrowded, prison-like detention centers, where violence, rioting andinfectious diseases have broken out.   Britain maintains the majority have not fled political orreligious persecution but are simply seeking a better standard ofliving than that available in Vietnam.   Each is being screened in accordance with standards set by theUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and Mrs. Thatchertold the House of Commons that only 13,000 have been declaredgenuine refugees.   The Foreign Office said Britain and Vietnam have been discussingfor several weeks how to handle the repatriation of those refusedpermission to stay in Hong Kong.   It would not say when a decision is expected or how many peoplewould be affected. Newspaper reports put the figure as high as40,000 and said Britain is considering chartering aircraft to takethem back.   Foreign Secretary John Major said Wednesday the influx ofVietnamese into densely populated Hong Kong ``cannot be borne muchlonger.''   ``We are seeking to cajole and persuade the Vietnamese boatpeople to return, but I now have to recognize that the problem inHong Kong is acute and getting worse,'' he said.   Britain's opposition Labor Party opposes forcible repatriation.When lawmakers confronted Mrs. Thatcher with the issue Thursday,one of them reminded her of the outrage in Britain over the 1972mass expulsion of Asians from Uganda.   Mrs. Thatcher retorted: ``Most countries repatriate illegalimmigrants... That is to say, we also put back over the Chineseborder some 35,000 illegal immigrants from China into Hong Kongeach year. The United States repatriates people to Mexico andHaiti. There's nothing unusual about deporting to repatriate.''   Britain is expected to pay some compensation to the boat peopleit sends back so they can buy tools and seeds on their return. AForeign Office spokesman said it would likely be comparable to the$600 paid to boat people who go home voluntarily.   So far, 386 have returned voluntarily to Vietnam and another 600to 700 have agreed to, he said.   An international conference in Geneva in June concluded thatnon-refugees must go back to Vietnam, but it could not agree onwhen or how this should be done.   Japan also has had an influx of Vietnamese boat people. So far,3,372 boat people supposedly from Vietnam have arrived in Japanthis year, compared with 219 in all of 1988. But immigrationofficials have found at least 1,642 Chinese nationals trying toenter Japan by posing as Vietnamese refugees.   A small wooden vessel believed to be carrying about 100 boatpeople was sighted Thursday in the East China Sea off southwesternJapan, the Maritime Safety Agency reported.   A coast guard plane confirmed sighting the boat, flying aVietnamese flag and a white flag marked SOS.</TEXT></DOC>
