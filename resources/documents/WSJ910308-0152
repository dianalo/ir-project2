Flares light the sky in the direction towardwhich we are heading. In the foreground we hear mortar andmachine-gun fire. We are heading directly into the firefight.   We arrive at the house safely, but the battle outsidecontinues until two in the morning. Helicopters whoosh byoverhead, and word comes that guerrillas are occupying somehouses several blocks away.</LP><TEXT>   Experienced Salvadorans say the most frightening of theweapons are the mortars. The machine-gun fire is always aimedat other gunners, so one feels relatively safe that onlycombatants will be hit. But the mortars can land anywhere.They are the Salvadoran guerrillas' version of SaddamHussein's Scuds. Apparently they are just as difficult to aimbecause most of those fired land in the street or in emptylots. But they could just as easily hit a house.   This was a mini-guerrilla offensive by Salvadoranstandards. The following day, the streets were filled withpeople going about their daily routine. Salvadorans have cometo accept these attacks as a difficult but perhapsunavoidable part of daily life in San Salvador -- like crimein New York. But it's impossible to ignore -- let alone sleepthrough -- a fire fight. And it certainly doesn't encourageforeign investment.   What is perhaps most offensive about the continuedguerrilla activity in this country is that for the past sevenyears the people of El Salvador have voted overwhelminglyagainst the political and economic agenda of the Marxistguerrillas. In the last presidential election, 90% of thevoters chose either the victorious Arena Party or itsChristian Democrat opponents. The rest of the vote wasdivided among fringe groups, which included politicalrepresentatives of the guerrillas. Still, many groups inEurope and the U.S. insist that the government of El Salvadoris a repressive instrument and that the guerrillas bestrepresent the people's interests.   But the Salvadorans themselves disagree -- especially nowthat their government allows them to produce without the fearthat their earnings or property will be confiscated. Theyvoted out the last government that did that: the lateNapoleon Duarte's Christian Democrat government. And thisSunday's congressional and local elections are likely tore-emphasize the people's resolve to reverse the socialistpolicies promoted by the Christian Democrats and U.S.economic advisers; Arena's candidates are heavily favored.   The man who has a right to be most frustrated by thecontinued reluctance of the world to recognize the progressEl Salvador has been making is President Alfredo Cristiani.Since his election two years ago, he has moved swiftly toderegulate commerce, privatize industries and export marketsand grant property rights to those who previously had beenforced into an inefficient system of collective farming. Hispolicies have led to an economic boom tempered only bycontinued guerrilla violence.   Coffee harvests -- the most inefficient in Central Americaduring the period of forced collectivization -- doubled lastyear. The currency, allowed to float against the dollar, hasstabilized. Cutting government expenditures has helpeddecrease inflation from 35% in 1989 to 19% in 1990. Banks,which had been decapitalized due to politically motivated badloans after their nationalization, are now awash in capitaland are to be privatized soon. The industrial sector --spurred on by lower taxes, a privatized export market andderegulation -- is taking off, despite a dramatic slashing ofprotectionist trade tariffs.   In an interview last week Mr. Cristiani talked of thechanges about which he is justifiably proud. Yet he issensitive to those who suggest that Salvador is reverting toits old, mercantilist ways:   &quot;We're not just rolling back. There were real problemswith the old ways -- opportunity was not always available forthe poorest classes. But there are ways of increasingeconomic opportunity without nationalizing everything, whichis what the last government did. In fact, after thenationalizations, economic opportunity was limited to thosewith political clout. So by privatizing, we are intent onincreasing opportunity for all, and guaranteeing propertyrights for those whose rights have never been respected.&quot;   In the politically sensitive area of land reform, Mr.Cristiani is trying to reintroduce the incentives of privateownership in the agricultural sector -- but without relyingon authoritarian, government-imposed edicts. Within twoweeks, the legislature is expected to approve a measure toallow cooperatives to grant individual land titles to itsmembers. The new landholders will have full rights to rent,sell or will their holdings. &quot;Why force the &quot;campesinos&quot; intoa specific type of farming?&quot; asks the president. &quot;Why notfreely allow them to choose what type of ownership they wantto have?&quot;   So if everything is going so well, what feeds theguerrillas? &quot;Money still flows to the guerrillas from othercountries,&quot; says the president, &quot;especially from theguerrilla solidarity committees in the U.S. and Europe. Thatmoney is used directly for actions like the other night andthe November 1989 offensive.&quot; The president points out thatmany of the guerrilla fighters in the 1989 offensive, inwhich about 2,000 people were killed, were not evenSalvadoran, a point backed up by Salvadoran civilians forcedto house and feed the guerrillas.   Despite the unrepresentative nature of the guerrillas'cause, the government continues to participate in UnitedNations-sponsored negotiations. Says Mr. Cristiani: &quot;We willnegotiate anything that does not interfere with ourconstitutional framework and that will consolidate thedemocratic formulas of the country. For example, I had amilitary-reform law in order to democratize the military thatI probably would have initiated even without the FMLN{Farabudo Marti National Liberation Front} pressure. I alsofeel there's need for judicial reform. So if those things aretheir objectives as well, why not negotiate with them? If youtake away all the excuses they make for waging war and add tothat the collapse of Marxist ideology throughout the world,there's a chance that they'll run out of fuel.&quot;   But one can't help wondering why the Salvadoran governmentshould be forced to negotiate with the FMLN? The guerrillasare demanding through extortion what they can't hope toachieve through the democratic process. There is little togain by negotiating with criminals, as President Bushrecently discovered in the Gulf. And that's what theSalvadoran conflict has become: a criminal problem.   ---   Mr. Asman is editor of the Americas column.</TEXT></DOC>
