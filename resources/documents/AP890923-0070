JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Concern about the environment is prompting anew push for automakers to produce more fuel efficient cars, but theindustry says with gasoline prices low their customers wantperformance and size over fuel economy.   According to Environmental Protection Agency figures, the autoindustry's move toward higher mileage cars has all but come to ahalt in recent years.   Average fleet-wide mileage jumped from 13.1 mpg in 1975 to 21.1mpg in 1982. Since then it has been creeping and often standingstill. The EPA mileage list announced last week reflected a fleetaverage of 24 mpg, the same as a year earlier.   But growing environmental concerns and the link betweenautomobile pollution and global warming, has unleashed new calls forthe industry to produce more fuel efficient vehicles.   Legislation by Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., to require a 40percent increase in average automobile fuel efficiency by the turnof the century, is given a good chance of passing the Senate.   That would put the average fleet-wide mileage for mostmanufacturers at about 40 mpg. Only some of the stingiest andsmallest subcompacts are able to obtain those kinds of mileagefigures today.   No similar proposal has emerged in the House where it would facethe strong opposition of Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of theEnergy and Commerce Committee.   But even serious discussion of such sharp increases in automileage is a far cry from only a year ago, when a Reaganadministration proposal to scrap federal fuel efficiency standardsaltogether received considerable support on Capitol Hill. PresidentBush has made no such suggestion.   Past demands for higher auto mileage were prompted by oilshortages and high gasoline prices. Today there is neither.   So what is driving the renewed interest in fuel efficiency?   ``The first and foremost reason is concern about globalwarming,'' says Robert Dewey an analyst for the Energy ConservationCoalition, a group that includes many of the largest environmentaland conservation organizations.   Environmentalists also have argued that cutting the demand forgasoline is the best way to curb the need for oil _ and, thereby,preserve pristine wilderness and environmentally delicate coastalareas that otherwise might be opened for drilling.   There also is continuing concern about the growing dependence onimported oil. ``In 1985, oil imports accounted for 32 percent of alloil used in this country. Last July imports exceeded 50 percent,''said Deborah Bleviss, executive director of the InternationalInstitute for Energy Conservation.   But it is the automobile's link to global warming that has giventhe issue a new spark.   Motor vehicles account for about a fourth of the releases in theUnited States of carbon dioxide, a major contributor to what manyscientists believe is a warming of the earth because of manmadepollution.   Carbon dioxide combines with other chemicals to form a gaseousveil in the atmosphere that traps heat like a greenhouse. Manyscientists believe this ``greenhouse effect'' _ if left unchecked _will cause a dangerous warming of the earth by the middle of thenext century.   ``It's time Detroit stopped protecting their gas guzzlers andstarted protecting our planet by producing safe, efficient vehiclescitizens want,'' Ruth Caplan, executive director of theEnvironmental Action Foundation, said recently as her group unveiledplans to distribute a series of 30-second television ads linkingcars to global warming.   But the auto industry argues that it is being picked on unfairly.   A requirement for cars to achieve and average fuel economy of 40mpg ``does little to address the global warming problems'' becausecarbon dioxide releases from U.S. cars account for only 2.5 percentof all the world's greenhouse gases, maintains Helen Petrauskas,vice president for environmental and safety engineering at FordMotor Co.   And to achieve such mileage increases will require automakers toreduce the size of their cars, she and other auto executives insist.   There may be a lot of talk about higher mileage requirements, butmarket indicators are just the opposite, says Ronald Boltz, a vicepresident for Chrysler Corp. He said customers are ``placing apremium on vehicle performance ... and less emphasis on fueleconomy.''   Cars such as the high-mileage Geo Metro _ a Japanese-madesubcompact sold by General Motors _ account for only 1 percent ofU.S. passenger car sales, echoed Marina Whitman, a GM vice president.</TEXT></DOC>
