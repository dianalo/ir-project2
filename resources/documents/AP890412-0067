The 68-year-old Mara said he expects to quit politics inDecember before Fiji returns to full parliamentary democracy, twoyears after the island nation suffered the first of two militarycoups.   He has been dogged by ill-health for the past year and madeseveral visits to Australia for treatment.   As befitting his senior chiefly status and 6-foot-6-inchstature, Mara has wielded immense influence in the region. He isrevered as the elder statesman of the South Pacific and is known as``the Old Man.''   He was appointed by Britain to lead Fiji to independence, andother nations like Papua New Guinea and Vanuatu followed his lead.Mara leads the Alliance Party and has been prime minister since1970.   His rule in the racially divided country was interrupted whenthe Indian-backed coalition party of Timoci Bavadra defeated him inthe 1987 general election, which triggered the first of twomilitary coups.   Fiji's population of 715,000 is almost evenly divided betweenethnic Melanesian Fijians and Indians, the descendants ofBritish-indentured sugar plantation laborers.   Mara's unexpected announcement to a meeting of governmentdepartment heads ended speculation he might extend his leadershipof the interim administration formed by coup leader Maj.-Gen.Sitiveni Rabuka.   Rabuka said he staged two coups _ in May and September 1987 _ toprotect the political rights of indigenous Fijians against agrowing Indian population. He asked Mara to return as primeminister while a new constitution is negotiated to enshrine thoserights.   Mara gave no reason for his retirement. He said simply, ``Myterm of office comes to an end in December this year and it is myintention to retire.''</TEXT></DOC>
