The appropriate reaction conditionswere selected under which the graft polymerization was carried out successfully.In this grafting system ammonium ferrous sulphate (Mohr's salt) was usedas inhibitor to minimize the homopolymerization of AAc, and a suitableconcentration of the inhibitor to be added to the reaction medium wasfound to be 2.5 wt%. The effect of aqueous monomer concentration on therate and degree of grafting was studied. The dependence of the graftingrate on the monomer concentration was found to be 0.8 order, i.e. almostfirst order dependence. It was also found that the irradiation atmosphere(air and nitrogen gas) had no significant effect on the grafting yieldat given reaction conditions. The prepared graft copolymer films showedgood thermal and chemical stability. Gel determination in the graftedfilms was also investigated and the results indicated that a crosslinkednetwork structure may be formed. The extent of the gelled part in thegraft copolymer increased as the degree of grafting increased.</TEXT></DOC>
