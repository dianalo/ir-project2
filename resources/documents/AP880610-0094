Col. Hernani Figueroa, spokesman for the army's southern Luzonisland command, identified the three as Antonio Bosch, 46, aFilipino of German descent; Klaus Schmidt, 52, a West GermanProtestant minister; and Stellan Hermansson, 30, a Swede.   Figueroa said the three were arrested Wednesday during amilitary operation in Quezon province. He said they had beentraining communist rebels in the Bondoc peninsula of Quezonprovince, a rebel stronghold.   He said two soldiers identified them as being with a band of NewPeople's Army guerrillas who raided the town of San Francisco lastFebruary. The soldiers were captured in the raid but escaped bykilling their guards a few days later.   Figueroa said the three were undergoing interrogation and werebeing held in a room at the command headquarters in Lucena City, 60miles southeast of Manila.   He said the military planned to charge them with eitherespionage or murder and robbery in the San Francisco raid. He saidthe trio was found with a camera containing film of rebels trainingand Hermansson was depicted holding a .30-caliber machine gun.   Spokesmen for the West German and Swedish embassies said theywere unaware of the reports. A spokesman for St. Andrew'sTheological Seminary in Manila said Schmidt had been teachingbiblical studies there for the past year and was expected to returnfor classes next week.   In Sweden, officials of the Young Communist League saidHermansson was a member of the organization. Spokesman ErikCardfelt said Hermansson arrived here May 18 to travel and gatherinformation for lectures. He said Hermansson was a freelancejournalist and was to have returned to Sweden Saturday.   The arrests followed charges by the military that Western groupsare supporting the New People's Army, which has been waging a19-year insurgency to establish a Communist state.   Last month, a captured rebel claimed journalists from NewZealand paid her guerrilla unit to stage an ambush in February insoutheastern Luzon in which 11 soldiers were killed.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos told foreign reporters Thursdaythat there was no corroborating evidence to support that charge.</TEXT></DOC>
