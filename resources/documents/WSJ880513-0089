Birnbaum </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> TRA </IN><G> CNG EXE </G><TEXT>   CONGRESS KEEPS TALKING about going on a spending diet, but it can't give up its pork.    Despite the lawmakers' promises to curtail budget deficits and despite the Gramm-Rudman law to force cuts, pork-barrel projects remain the grease that helps keep the wheels of legislation turning. The federal government is laying out a mind-boggling $1 trillion a year, and the fight over who will get slices for their constituents, and who won't, is a crucial part of the process. In this never-ending debate, one person's pork is another person's steak.    But don't mention pork in Prunedale.    Residents of the Northern California community have worked for years to get a bypass built around their little town to relieve dangerous traffic conditions. But when the federal government finally coughed up $1.9 million last year to get the project rolling, President Reagan labeled it &quot;pork barrel.&quot;    Proud Prunedalians haven't forgiven him yet.    &quot;It offends me that anyone would characterize this project as pork barrel,&quot; fumes Marc Del Piero, chairman of the Monterey County Board of Supervisors. &quot;This is a health and safety issue, people are dying here!&quot;    Localities like Prunedale often get caught up in the bidding for jobs and services. The bidding is part of the bare-knuckled, big-dollar arena of national politics. Only the most powerful lawmakers are ever wholly satisfied.    Prunedale got its portion last year with the help of its heavy-hitting congressman, Democratic Rep. Leon Panetta. Next year, ironically, the same Rep. Panetta will lead the fight to reduce deficits as House Budget Committee chairman. Although the congressman was able to produce for Prunedale, less-potent lawmakers probably would have failed, especially in promoting a project like the Prunedale bypass, which benefits one region while skipping others.    Pork-barrel spending got its moniker a century ago from a pig-headed satirist who compared lawmakers' passion for pet projects to slaves' attraction to salt pork. But special-interest spending goes back even further. As long as there have been federal tax dollars, members of Congress have found roads, bridges and dams to spend them on in their districts.    For just as long, critics of pork have lambasted these highly targeted projects as inherently wasteful. President Reagan stepped up the volume of this chorus this year by attacking such purportedly porky projects as a $900,000 catfish aquaculture facility in Stutgart, Ark.; a $2.4 million grant for the &quot;tailored clothing industry,&quot; and a $5 million gondola transportation system at an Idaho resort area.    Despite the upbraiding, and despite a deficit that this year will total $160 billion, pork barreling is here to stay. The giving away of special favors in the form of direct appropriations or tax breaks is one of the most fundamental ways in which Congress works. Providing them is a time-honored method of gathering enough votes to pass major pieces of legislation, which might be too bitter for a lawmaker to swallow without a little sweetener for the folks back home.    &quot;It's a shame you have to grease the skids with pork in order to get people to do their duty,&quot; laments Republican Rep. Richard Armey of Texas, a leading congressional opponent of special-interest spending. &quot;But that's the way business is done in this town.&quot;    Thanks to this sentiment, legislation continues to be larded with a growing variety of special projects. Dams, roads and bridges, known as &quot;green pork,&quot; are old hat. These days, there is also &quot;academic pork&quot; in the form of research grants to colleges, &quot;defense pork&quot; in the form of geographically specific military expenditures and lately &quot;high-tech pork,&quot; in the form of the intense fight to house the government's multi-billion-dollar super-collider project.    Many lawmakers believe it is their duty to bring home the bacon, and they have trouble understanding why anyone would think otherwise. &quot;Pork-barreling has gotten a bad name,&quot; says Rep. Douglas Bosco, a California Democrat. &quot;That's what I'm here for. It turns out to be one of the few tangible things we can do in Congress.&quot;    Some legislators even see hypocrisy in the statements of those who say they oppose the projects on principle. Lawmakers, says Rep. Kenneth Gray, grouse about &quot;pork&quot; projects until they win some of their own. Then they call them &quot;meritorious expenditures,&quot; says the Illinois Democrat. &quot;When I say to my audiences 'Pass the pork,' I get more applause than for anything else,&quot; says Mr. Gray, who likes to be called the &quot;King of Pork.&quot;    Still, the argument about the wisdom of such spending rages. Rural lawmakers grumble about mass-transit subsidies for cities. Urban lawmakers try to trim price supports for agricultural products. And conservatives, such as President Reagan, gripe about nonmilitary programs, while liberals believe the conservatives are the spendthrifts when it comes to the military.    In the case of Prunedale, the White House asserts that Rep. Panetta abused the system on behalf of his constituents. A spokeswoman says that ample funds already were allocated for highway construction and were placed into the hands of the people best able to decide where they should be spent -- the states. Writing money for Prunedale directly into law, the White House spokeswoman says, was excessive and overbearing.    Mr. Panetta disagrees. &quot;It's a legitimate legislative tactic to use, and frankly I don't think I'd be doing my job if I didn't use it,&quot; he says of the appropriation he helped insert into last year's omnibus spending bill. &quot;I'm not here to walk away from these issues. I'm here to represent my area. I can make the case for why this is an important project, but people don't listen to that when you've making broadbrush criticism of these projects.&quot;    A look at how Congress spends money is exemplified by the Prunedale bypass:   Prunedale is a wrinkle in Route 101, a major, four-lane thoroughfare that links San Francisco and Los Angeles. The unincorporated area of about 15,000 people, which was named for its now-exhausted prune business, is the kind of place that people drive through but usually don't remember.    Prunedale is noteworthy for the number of automotive accidents and injuries that occur within its boundaries. According to the latest available statistics, 113 people were injured in 1986 and five were killed in auto accidents along the 7.2-mile stretch of Route 101 that serves as Prunedale's main drag.    Accidents have been increasing for years because of heavy truck traffic and poorly marked local access roads. In reaction, citizens formed the &quot;North Monterey County Mothers and 101 Bypass Committee&quot; in 1983 and began to lobby for help. The nonprofit group collected thousands of signatures on petitions and traveled three hours to testify before the California State Transportation Commission in Sacramento every year.    But Prunedale was spurned. The commission tends to focus its funds on more populous regions. So the 101 Bypass Committee turned instead to the federal government in the person of its amiable congressman, Rep. Panetta. During one of his routine &quot;constituent hours&quot; at the Prunedale Library, Mr. Panetta was urged to back the project by a woman whose 17-year-old daughter was killed on Route 101.    The congressman didn't need that much prodding. Though he is known as one of Congress's most vigorous enemies of budget deficits, Mr. Panetta says he also is a proud advocate for his constituents. So, in 1985, he began a two-year crusade that resulted in the appropriation last year of $1.9 million for the design of the $50 million project.    Mr. Panetta followed a course that is typical for a lawmaker trying to get financing for constituents. It involved working within the Byzantine rules of Congress, and more important, using personal contacts with colleagues from his own state who serve on the appropriate committees.    At first, Mr. Panetta attempted to prod state authorities into releasing already available money by including language in a highway-authorization bill that named the bypass as a &quot;priority&quot; project. He did this by lobbying the chairman of the relevant subcommittee, who at the time was Democratic Rep. Glenn Anderson and who by &quot;very important coincidence,&quot; Rep. Panetta says, is a Californian.    President Reagan vetoed the measure, claiming it was larded with pork. But Congress decisively overrode the veto.    When Prundale failed to get the highway-construction funds, Rep. Panetta in frustration sought a direct appropriation, cornering important lawmakers to press the case for Prunedale.    In this campaign, he worked closely with fellow Democratic Rep. Vic Fazio, who often represents northern California projects in the Appropriations Committee. &quot;They double-teamed us,&quot; remembers Democratic Rep. William Lehman of Florida.    Messrs. Panetta and Fazio proved to be a potent combination. The case for the bypass was persuasive and the start-up costs were relatively small. &quot;It certainly didn't hurt,&quot; Rep. Lehman adds, that Rep. Panetta is the incoming chairman of the Budget Committee.    The Prunedale appropriation was a tiny item buried in thousands of pages of legislation passed in a rush at the end of last year. But for the people of Prunedale it was a very big deal. &quot;It's the single most important cause in our area,&quot; says Carol Lacy, chairwoman of the 101 Bypass Committee.    It got the attention of the White House, and President Reagan criticized the action earlier this year in a document delivered to Congress that listed billions of dollars in &quot;pork-barrel&quot; projects. &quot;I don't like the criticism,&quot; Rep. Panetta says, &quot;but at the same time it's not going to divert me from doing what I think is in the best interest of my district.&quot;    For the congressman, victory is a mixed blessing. One price of pork is that now he is vulnerable to the request of a favor in return from the lawmakers who helped Prunedale get its roadway funds. &quot;There is an unwritten rule around here,&quot; Rep. Panetta says. &quot;If I go to a member {for help}, at some point down the road, they'll remember that.&quot;    ---   Mr. Birnbaum covers Congress and politics from The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
