The Council for Peace and Security plans to use videotapes ofpopular war heros to contend that the nation's defense will beenhanced, not compromised, if it gives up the occupied lands, saidcouncil coordinator Moshe Amirav.   ``Our first message is that there is nothing to be afraid of _the state of Israel is strong,'' Amirav said.``We are not standingon Massada and we are not in the ghetto.''   He was referring to the historic persection of Jews. Massada isthe desert fortress where Jews killed themselves rather thansurrender to Roman rule in the 1st Century A.D. Ghettos were thewalled areas in which European Jews were forced to live.   The council's plans, decided at a meeting Sunday, were outlinedby Amirav and several former generals. They concern strategy forthe occupied lands after an Israeli withdrawal.   The council was formed last April and is not affiliated with anypolitical party. But its campaign is timed to have an impact onnational elections Nov. 1 in which security is expected to be amajor issue.   Amirav said he hoped the generals could dispel the widespreadperception that anyone who favors territorial compromise is``soft'' on national defense.   ``We are going to kill a lot of holy cows, and people are goingto get very angry,'' he said.   The generals argue that ruling over 1.5 million hostilePalestinians poses a greater threat to Israel's security thanreturning the land occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.   They say the occupation saps the army and the unresolved disputecould spark an attack by combined Arab forces of a million soldiers.   In exchange for giving up some land, Israel could insist oncertain defensive arrangements, said council member Yosef Geva, abusinessman and reserve army major general.   Amirav said the country then could devote the bulk of itsenergy, funds and manpower to developing the economy, strengtheningthe army and solving other pressing problems.   But Israelis who have lived through six wars in 40 years arewary of returning to narrow, pre-1967 Israel and fear what wouldhappen if an armed Palestinian state were formed next door.   To counter their fears, the council has discussed such securityoptions as making the West Bank a demilitarized zone, keepingIsraeli outposts in the area or stationing an international forcethere.   It plans to convey its ideas through videotapes of generals whofought in Israel's wars and even drop fliers from planes ontocrowded beaches in the summer.   But even before the campaign got under way, right-wingpoliticians attacked the council, which is made up of scholars andbusinessmen as well as 30 major generals, 80 brigadier generals and100 colonels, all in the active reserve.   ``Don't be such big heroes,'' said parliament member RafaelEitan, the hardline politician who was the army's chief of staffduring Israel's 1982 Lebanon invasion. ``When people are free ofresponsibilities, their tongue is long.''   Geula Cohen, whose Tehiya party favors annexing the territories,accused the group of working for Foreign Minister Shimon Peres'Labor Party.   Labor favors giving up some lands seized in 1967 to win peacewith the Arabs. The rival Likud bloc of Prime Minister YitzhakShamir is against returning any Arab land.   Amirav, who was expelled from the Likud for holding secretmeetings with Palestinian leaders, said hard-line politicians usefear to manipulate the Israeli public and gain votes.   ``They present security and peace as opposites ... but we willstop this, and show that peace is security,'' Amirav said.   Shlomo Gazit, a reserve major general and former head of armyintelligence, noted that demographic trends indicate the Arabpopulation in Israel and the territories could outnumber the Jewishpopulation in the next century because of higher Arab birth rates.   If that happens, he said, Israel may have to withdrawunilaterally from the territories and not have the luxury ofdemanding security arrangements.</TEXT></DOC>
