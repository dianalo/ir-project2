The POF will address issues such as high-beta operation,current drive, impurity control, and will test geometric and configurationalvariations such as the spherical torus or the reversed-field pinch (RFP).The FERF will be designed to accumulate rapidly a large neutron dosein prototypical fusion subsystems exposed to radiation. Both facilitieswill require low-cost replacement cores and rapid replacement times.The Demountable Toroidal Fusion Core (DTFC) facility is designed to fulfillthese requirements. It would be a cost-effective stepping stone betweenthe CIT and a demonstration fusion reactor.</TEXT></DOC>
