the company last week unveiled a family of computers that makes useof a highspeed link to provide a loose clustering of one or more IBMmainframes into a single logical platform called a sysplex.andM;At the core of IBM's clustering strategy is the Enterprise Systems Connection(Escon) architecture, which is built on a 10MB-per-second fiber-optic link ina switched point-to-point topology.andP;  In DEC terms, the Escon channel might bethought of as IBM's CI port.andM;Playing the roles of DEC's Star Couplers are IBM's Escon Directors 1 and 2,with as many as 16 and 60 ports, respectively.andM;Although direct attachment of channels to I/O control units is possible, theinsertion of Escon Directors between channels and I/O control units providesa means of dynamically configuring, from a console on the Director,channel-to-channel and channel-to-control unit connections extending as faras 9 kilometers, or 5.6 miles.andM;Models within the Enterprise System/9000 series can be configured withbetween 12 and 256 Escon fiber-optic channels.andP;  Each channel can address amaximum of 1,024 I/O devices or 512 different channels.andM;Escon's high throughput allows IBM hosts--from the Enterprise System/9000line or IBM's 3090-9000T or 3090 model J line of processors--to share remoteI/O devices without response-time degradation, according to companyofficials.andM;IBM also released the 3172 model 2 Interconnect Controller, which acts as aLAN gateway and a remote channel-to-channel controller over T1 links.andM;The 3172 model 2 gives LAN nodes--Ethernet, Token Ring, FDDI andManufacturing Automation Protocol--access to hosts and peripherals in thesysplex.andM;The company also plans to release a Micro Channel adapter card for the RISCSystem/6000 that will provide direct interconnection between these systemsand Escon channels.andM;DEC has always argued that VAXes make better front ends to IBM mainframesthan IBM midrange systems.andP;  By giving the RISC System/6000 the ability toparticipate in an IBM cluster, today via the 3172 model 2 InterconnectController and later with a direct Escon channel, Big Blue seeks to nullifyone of the major selling points DEC uses to crack commercial IBM accounts.andM;Through the loose clustering provided by Escon and IBM's Sysplex Timer, whichcan synchronize as many as 48 processors in eight machines, IBM is &quot;breakingdown the walls of the glass-house data center,&quot; said Carl Conti, IBM's seniorvice president and general manager of Enterprise Systems.andM;As part of IBM's clustering push, officials said, the software that thecompany uses to manage clusters, called SystemView, will be extended tonon-IBM systems via Big Blue's NetView network management architecture.andM;'Recommitment to midrange users'andM;&quot;The significance for DEC is that IBM has made a recommitment to its midrangeusers after letting them suffer in pain for the last four years,&quot; said JohnLogan, a vice president of the Aberdeen Group, a Boston-based consultingcompany.andM;&quot;While IBM is late by several years, which hurt many a user and customer,they have now come back with a full commitment right in the heart of themarketplace where DEC competes with IBM,&quot; Logan said.andM;As part of that commitment, IBM released upgrades of its DB2 and SQL/DSdatabases, as well as Information Management System/Enterprise SystemsArchitecture Database Manager (IMS/ESA DB) that officials said will bring IBMusers closer to truly distributed processing by providing transparent dataretrieval from both databases.andM;According to Richard Whitman, DEC's group marketing manager ofHigh-Performance Systems, IBM's announcement is a nod in DEC's generaltechnological direction, but is designed primarily to fend off the nascentbut strengthening competition from plug-compatible manufacturers (PCMs).andM;&quot;Little of [the] announcement looks like it was coming after Digital,&quot;Whitman said.andP;  Instead, IBM &quot;took the things that we do and is using them toknock out the PCMs.&quot;andM;IBM's cluster capabilities are &quot;what clusters were when we announced them in1983,&quot; Whitman said.andM;He claimed that there are significant differences between the two companies'methods.andP;  Whereas an IBM sysplex is currently limited in terms of whichcomputers may be linked, the VAXcluster methodology allows any VAX,regardless of size, to be part of the cluster.andM;However, the weakest element of IBM's clustering method is the software,Whitman said.andP;  Developing software for such systems &quot;is very difficult to do.andO;It's another software construct,&quot; Whitman said.andM;And although IBM has announced the support of approximately 250 softwaredevelopers for its ESA architecture, the software may be some time in themaking.andM;IBM's Enterprise System/9000 series, which consists of 18 models ranging inprice from $70,500 to $22.8 million, is based on a processor design that ismore than twice as dense as previous processor chips.andP;  Ten of the 18Enterprise System/9000 processor models are air-cooled.andM;IBM's overall clustering capabilities are &quot;simply going to be a lot morepowerful than what DEC is going to offer,&quot; said George Colony, president ofForrester Research, a market research company in Cambridge, Mass.andM;&quot;But this is playing catch-up on IBM's part.andP;  .  .  .  It can have a smallimpact on DEC.andP;  The proprietary architectures don't butt up against eachother that much,&quot; Colony added.andM;&quot;The rack-mount and frame-mounted air-cooled systems are going to becompetitive with DEC's [VAX] 9000 and 4000, but I think this is going to havelight impact on DEC,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;Frankly, if you're an IBM [user], you're not going to drop a 370 to buy DEC,and vice versa,&quot; he said.andM;Although IBM did not release any performance benchmarks for the EnterpriseSystem/9000 line, the company did claim that the model 900 provides between1.7 and 1.9 times the processor performance of IBM's 3090 model 600 J incommercial applications, and more than doubles that system's performance inboth scalar and vector applications.andM;Fourteen of the models can be equipped with vector-processing modules.andM;In addition, the Enterprise System/9000 computers feature a fully transparentsoftware upgrade path, from the operating system to applications software,according to officials.andM;Enhanced versions of IBM's MVS, VSE and VM operating systems were alsoreleased for the Enterprise System/9000 computers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
