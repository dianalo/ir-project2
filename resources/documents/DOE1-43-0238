The levels offollicle - stimulating (FSH) and luteinizing (LH) hormones of the pituitary,prolactin, ACTH, estradiol, progesterone, testosterone, cortisol andaldosterone were studied. Such disturbances as decreased production ofFSH, LH, progesterone and testosterone were observed before operation.Surgery was followed by a considerable rise in prolactin production andbasal levels of FSH and LH, a decrease in estradiol, progesterone andtestosterone concentrations and was accompanied by a sizeable releaseof cortisol and aldosterone.</TEXT></DOC>
