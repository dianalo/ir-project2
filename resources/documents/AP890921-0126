SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. troops sent to restore calm to thehurricane-ravaged Virgin Islands ``are having an obvious impact incontrolling the looting and other lawlessness,'' White House presssecretary Marlin Fitzwater said today.   ``Our purpose is to help out in an interim and temporary wayuntil the local law enforcement can handle the problem,'' Fitzwatertold reporters.   President Bush authorized the use of the troops to halt a lootingfrenzy and protect residents and tourists from the lawlessnessgripping St. Croix two days after Hurricane Hugo's devastation.   ``The situation there is improving somewhat,'' Fitzwater said.``The troops are having an obvious impact in controlling the lootingand other lawlessness associated with the destruction.''   He said it was impossible to predict how long the troops, whichbegan arriving this morning, would remain on St. Croix.   ``We stay in close contact with the police authorities on theislands and the governors and will be guided by their feelings aboutwhen they're in control and when they can handle the situation,''Fitzwater said.   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. William J. Crowesaid in an interview today that the troops have been issued riflesand ordered to shoot if necessary to defend themselves.   ``Certainly, we never deploy troops if they don't have the rightto defend themselves,'' Crowe said. ``We've had reports of shootingon the island. We're not going to permit people to be totallydefenseless.''   The chairman said the decision was made to send in the troopsafter ``federal authorities on the scene were reporting chaos, andnear-anarchy and the situation as being out of control.''   Crowe added that he envisioned the troops would remain on theisland a ``very short period of time,'' but he did not define thetime any further.   ``The task force commander, Brig. Gen. Walter B. Moore, is now onthe scene and is assessing the situation,'' said Lt. Comdr. NedLundquist, a Pentagon spokesman. ``He will deploy troops asnecessary.''   Lundquist said Moore was on board the first plane of some 76military personnel that arrived at 7:40 a.m. EDT. The contingentformed an advance team that planned to secure the airfield, set up amobile control tower and organize the command structure for theother troops that will be arriving later in the day.   ``Members of the armed forces of the United States will be usedto suppress the violence ... and to restore law and order in andabout the Virgin Islands,'' Bush said in a statement Wednesday night.   It appeared to be the first time in more than 20 years that apresident ordered active duty military personnel into the nation'sstreets.   About 700 soldiers began leaving Pope Air Force Base, N.C., earlytoday.   ``I think the show of force is going to go a long way (in endingthe looting),'' said Lt. Gen. Carl W. Stiner, commander of the 18thAirborne Corps and Fort Bragg.   The Pentagon said in a statement that 1,105 military police wouldbegin arriving in St. Croix by early morning on 16 Air Force C-141Starlifter transport planes.   The units were to include 635 military police from Fort Bragg,N.C.; and 470 military police from companies in Fort Polk, La.; FortHood, Texas; and Fort Leonard Wood, Mo.   On Wednesday, armed Coast Guard crewmen from at least one of thesix Coast Guard ships in the area went ashore on St. Croix, thelargest of the three main U.S. Virgin Islands at 84 square miles, totry to restore order.   After Hugo hit St. Croix, damaging virtually every building onthe island of 53,000, looters stripped stores of merchandise andmany residents armed themselves with guns and knives.   To counter roaming lawless mobs, merchants posted armed guards.   Local National Guardsmen and police reportedly joined in thelooting. A spokesman for the Pentagon's National Guard Bureau, Maj.Bob Dunlap, said the reports involving Guardsmen were not confirmed.   On Wednesday, the popular tourist retreat still lacked water,power and telephone service. Hurricane winds that stripped treesturned the lush island southeast of Puerto Rico into a brownwasteland.   The island's governor said Hugo caused no deaths, but hundreds ofpeople were reported injured and thousands left homeless. Holland L.Redfield II, a territorial senator, said as much as 90 percent ofthe island was destroyed.   Coast Guard cutters evacuated frightened tourists and residents,some of whom had pleaded with arriving reporters to take them off.   About 145 St. Croix tourists arrived in Miami late Thursday nighton an evacuation flight arranged by U.S. marshals. The injured,elderly and pregnant women were given first priority, and otherpassengers were taken on a space-available basis.   ``We just got lucky,'' said Bob McManus of West Point, Conn.``The looters were everywhere there. They said, `We're in chargenow.' At one grocery store, they just rolled up trucks and loadedthem up.''   U.S. District Judge Stanley Brotman of Camden, N.J., who was ontemporary assignment in St. Croix, said he first had to protecthimself from the storm, then the armed looters.   Meanwhile, Virgin Islands Gov. Alexander Farrelly said Wednesdaynight he did not ask for the federal troops. Bush had said thegovernor of the islands requested the them, and White Housespokesman Steve Hart said later the governor's denial was ``contraryto the information I have.''   Usually, in cases of civil disturbances, it is the Guard that iscalled out to help restore order, but federal law allows thepresident to declare an emergency during civil disturbances and touse federal troops to restore calm.   At the White House, presidential assistant James Cicconi wasasked what orders would be given the troops about the use of force.He replied, ``I'm sure they'd use only that which was necessary andappropriate.''   The Pentagon also was dispatching three small reconnaissanceOH-58 helicopters, some transport vehicles and ``appropriate medicalsupport,'' the agency's statement said.   The last time federal troops were used to suppress riots was in1968 in Washington, D.C., after the assassination of Martin LutherKing Jr., administration officials said.   President Reagan authorized the use of troops in 1987 to dealwith prison riots in Atlanta, but that trouble subsided before theywere deployed.</TEXT></DOC>
