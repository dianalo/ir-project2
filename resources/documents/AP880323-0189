Police said four Skyhawks and eight Phantom F-4s roared in at4:05 p.m. and staged eight dive-bombing and rocketing runs in aone-hour raid.   At least five bases manned by guerrillas of terrorist mastermindAbu Nidal's Fatah-Revolutionary Council went up in flames in thevillages of Bekesta, Majdelyoun and Salhiyeh near Sidon's Einel-Hilweh refugee camp, police said.   One rocket struck a guerrilla arms depot in Bekesta, setting offa two-hour chain of ammunition explosions that demolished thebuilding, police said.   In a military communique Fatah-Revolutionary Council claimed thejets raided only ``one of the organization's positions.'' It vowedto ``severely strike back against the Zionist enemy's arrogance andbarbarism ... at the adequate time and venue.''   ``The attacks left a number of our heroic fighters martyred orwounded. We will announce specific figures in a later communique,''the statement said. ``This crime will be added to the black recordof the Zionist enemy.''   A base of the Moscow-oriented Democratic Front for theLiberation of Palestine also was destroyed as the jets fired 25rockets and dozens of delayed-action bombs in the area, policereported.   They said the warplanes also hit Sidon's power plant, plungingthe city into darkness. Sidon residents watched the raid frombalconies.   Guerrillas cordoned off the stricken targets after the raid,preventing police and reporters from getting a casualty figure.However, police said two boys aged five and 10 were rushed toSidon's Hammoud hospital from Bekesta.   Israel Radio's Hebrew broadcast said explosions in Sidonprevented Red Cross vehicles from reaching the bombed areas. Itsaid residents of Sidon and its Palestinian refugee camps closedtheir stores and rushed in panic to bomb shelters.   A communique from the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine said an unspecified number of Lebanese civilians wereinjured in the raid.   ``The escalation of the enemy's aggression reflects thedeepening crisis engulfing Israel as a result of the continuousPalestinian uprising in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip,''said the communique, released in Beirut.   It described the raid as ``the first fruit'' of Israeli PrimeMinister Yitzhak Shamir's recent visit to Washington.   The Israeli command said its planes destroyed buildings used byguerrillas for storing military hardware and vehicles.   Police said Israeli gunboats cruised off Sidon, 25 miles southof Beirut, during and after the raid. It was Israel's fourth intoLebanon this year.   The Israelis said all planes returned safely to their bases andthat the pilots reported accurate hits.   Sidon police said the Israeli pilots released air balloons thatdeflected waves of heat-seeking SAM-7 missiles shoulder-fired byguerrillas.   A communique issued by the Popular Liberation Army militia ofSidon's Sunni Moslem Nasserite leader, Mustafa Saad, said itspositions east of the city were also hit by the Israeli jets.   It charged the air attack was aimed at breaking the``Lebanese-Palestinian nationalist alliance.''   Saad's militia, which has controlled Sidon since the 1975outbreak of Lebanon's civil war, has been allied with YasserArafat's Palestine Liberation Organization and maintained closeties with Abu Nidal's group, which opposes Arafat.   Thirty-one people were killed and 43 wounded in the previousIsraeli air raids on Lebanon this year.</TEXT></DOC>
