Sen. Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the maverick Connecticut Republican,had pushed for both planks.   While endorsing the principal of catastrophic coverage forchildren, the Republicans shied away from any dollar commitments.   Weicker won the 53-30 vote after assuring fellow delegates therewas ``no financial commitment involved ... but rather a commitmentof spirit by this party.''   Angela ``Bay'' Buchanan, former U.S. treasurer from Irvine,Calif., warned that the Republicans who have pilloried theDemocratic platform as deceitful might be headed down the samepath. The GOP platform pledges not to raise taxes, but ``we allknow (catastrophic coverage) is going to be expensive,'' she said.   On AIDS, the delegates voted by voice not to endorse thepresidential commission's report. President Reagan has rejected thecommission's advice to seek new anti-discrimination legislation toprotect AIDS victims.   Vice President George Bush, who will receive the party'spresidential nomination next week, has endorsed the AIDS commissionreport.   ``Our president hasn't signed off on this report,'' said Rep.Chuck Lewis of California, a platform co-chairman.   The delegates left intact their AIDS plank, which calls for avigorous fight against the disease, ``compassion and help'' forvictims and the taking of steps to ``protect those who do not havethe disease.''   Rich Montoya of Las Cruces, N.M., said the AIDS plank ``showswhat this party is all about. It shows compassion for those poorindividuals that are afflicted with AIDS, but it shows reason inprotecting the vast majority of our constituents that areunafflicted by this disease.''   Earlier, the platform writers endorsed the idea of aconstitutional amendment to limit the terms of senators and membersof the House, rejected a Weicker amendment to commit the party topreserve the Small Business Administration and declared the party achampion of women as well as minorities.   The 106-member Platform Committee was aiming for a Thursdayconclusion to drafting of the document that will be presented tothe convention on Tuesday.   Going line-by-line over the 30,000-word document crafted by itsstaff and revised by subcommittees Tuesday, the full committee alsoaccepted an amendment by Rep. Nancy Johnson of Connecticutpromising the party will ``work to assure access to health care forall Americans through public and private initiatives.''   The draft, sticking with the main tenets of the GOP'sconservative 1984 platform, includes a firm pledge not to raisetaxes, endorses constitutional amendments to ban abortion andbalance the federal budget, and calls for ``rapid and certaindeployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative.''   In a plank on economic opportunity, the delgates inserted``women'' in the phrase, ``the GOP is the natural champion ofblacks, minorities, women and ethnic Americans.'' Ming Chen Hsu ofWestfield, N.J., suggested the change.   Polls have indicated that more women tend to favor Democraticnominee Michael Dukakis over Bush.   James Summers of Bellevue, Wash., opposed the amendment, saying,``We should no more have women in our platform than we have men.... It would be absolutely pandering to a single constituency wherewe appear, according to the pollsters, to be having a problem.''   The delegates heatedly debated the platform's proposed hard lineagainst abortion, including a declaration that ``the unborn childhas a fundamental individual right to life which cannot beinfringed.''   They voted 55-32 to reject an attempt by Marjorie Bell Chambersof Los Alamos, N.M., to delete the last four words.   ```Cannot be infringed' says to me that men and fetuses have aright to life at all times, but women lost that right when theybecome pregnant,'' said Chambers.   The delegates rejected by voice a Weicker amendment to supportMedicaid funding of abortion in the case of rape or incest, despitea plea from Rep. Johnson to recognize that ``rape is awful.''   ``Murder under any circumstances is also a terrible crime,''replied pro-life delegate Pat Elf of Kihei, Hawaii.   The committee also rejected after a perfunctory debate apro-Equal Rights Amendment statement sought by Delaware's LynnGlaze.   The Platform Committee adjourned for the night after rejectingtwo Weicker amendments on educating the handicapped and the rightsof the disabled, while approving a third calling for Medicaid tocover community-based services.   The committee had completed its draft plank on the economy andmost of its section on family issues. That left five other sections_ education, agriculture, energy-environment-transportation,defense and foreign policy _ to be hammered out Thursday.   Weicker said, ``We're managing to win a few small victories.''Earlier, however, he said the platform was shaping up as only``slightly better'' than the party's ``disastrous'' 1984 platform.He predicted, ``This is the last platform hurrah, believe me, ofthe far right.''   The Republicans also released what they said was a GOP staffestimate of how much implicit promises in the Democratic platformwill wind up costing taxpayers: $43.1 billion in 1989 alone.   Sen. Robert Kasten said the Republicans assume Dukakis would endup embracing costly, specific legislation that Democrats havealready introduced in Congress.</TEXT></DOC>
