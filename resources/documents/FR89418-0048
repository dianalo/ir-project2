On December 9, 1988, petitioner filed a request foralignment of the countervailing duty and antidumping final determinations.This postponement was approved under section 705 of the Act and publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 13, 1989 (54 FR 6562).    We conducted verification in Singapore, from January 31 through February2, 1989, of the questionnaire responses of the Government of Singapore(GOS) and Mitsuboshi Belts (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. (MBS).    Petitioner and respondents requested a public hearing, which was held onMarch 16, 1989. Pre-hearing briefs were filed by petitioner and respondentson March 15 and February 24, respectively. Both parties filed post-hearingbriefs on March 28, 1989.    <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation    </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS), as provided for in section 1201 <T3>et seq. </T3>of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988.All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS sub-headings. The HTS sub-heading are provided for convenience andCustoms purposes. The written description remains dispositive.    The products covered by this investigation are industrial belts and componentsand parts thereof, whether cured or uncured, currently provided for underTSUSA item numbers 358.0210 358.0290 358.0610 358.0690 358.0800 358.0900358.1100 358.1400 358.1600, 657.2520, 773.3510, and 773.3520 and currentlyclassifiable under HTS item numbers 3926.9055, 3926.9056, 3926.9057, 3926.9059,3926.9060, 4010.1010, 4010.1050, 4010.9111, 4010.9115, 4010.9119, 4010.9150,4010.9911, 4010.9915, 4010.9919, 4010.9950, 5910.0010, 5910.0090 and 7326.2000.   The merchandise covered by this investigation includes certain industrialbelts for power transmission. These include V-belts, synchronous belts,round belts and flat belts, in part or wholly of rubber or plastic, andcontaining textile fiber (including glass fiber) or steel wire, cord orstrand, and whether in endless (i.e., closed loop) belts, or in beltingin lengths or links. This investigation excludes conveyor belts and automotivebelts as well as front engine drive belts found on equipment powered byinternal combustion engines, including trucks, tractors, buses, and lifttrucks.       <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs</ITAG>For purposes of this final determination, the period for which we are measuringbounties or grants (``the review period'') is April 1, 1987 to March 31,1988, which corresponds to the fiscal year of the respondent company.Based upon our analysis of the petition, the responses to our questionnaires,verification, and written comments filed by the petitioner and respondents,we determine the following:I. Program Determined to Confer Bounties or GrantsWe determine that bounties or grants are being provided to manufacturers,producers, or exporters in Singapore of industrial belts under the followingprogram<ITAG tagnum="81">Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) Rediscount Facility</ITAG>Under the MAS Rediscounting Scheme, the MAS rediscounts pre-export andexport bills of exchange. A qualifying exporter applies for financing froman approved bank, which then discounts the exporter's bills at an MAS-establisheddiscount rate plus a maximum spread of 1.5 percent. The bank subsequentlyrediscounts the bills with the MAS, at the MAS discount rate. The usualperiod for financing under this program is three months.Because this program is available only to exporters, we determine thatit is countervailable to the extent that it is offered at preferentialrates. To determine whether financing under this program was made at preferentialrates, we compared the interest rates charged on these loans to a short-termbenchmark. In deriving the short-term benchmark, we followed the same methodologyexplained in our recent <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determinations and CountervailingDuty Orders: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings)and parts Thereof from Singapore,</T3> announced on March 23, 1989. Threetypes of short-term financing were available, exclusively in Singaporedollars, during the review period: overdrafts, short-term loans and commercialbills. Because none of the types of short-term financing was predominantduring the review period, we used a weighted average of the rates on thesetypes of financing as our benchmark. Based on the comparison of our short-termbenchmark with the MAS rates, we found that the rates on the MAS rediscountfacility were preferential. Therefore, we determine this program to becountervailable.To calculate the benefit arising from this program, we followed our short-termloan methodology, which has been applied consistently in our past determinationsand which is described in more detail in the <T3>Subsidies Appendix </T3>attached to the notice of <T3>Cold-Rolled Carbon Steel Flat-Rolled Products from Argentina: FinalAffirmative Countervailing Duty Determination and Countervailing Duty Order</T3>(49 FR 18006, April 26, 1984).We compared the amount of interest actually paid during the review to theamount the company would have paid at the benchmark rate. MBS utilizedMAS financing on a shipment-by-shipment basis and was, therefore, ableto segregate MAS loans according to product and export destination. Therefore,we allocated the total benefit attributable to U.S. sales of the subjectmerchandise over export sales of the subject merchandise to the UnitedStates during the review period. The estimated net bounty or grant underthis program is 0.35 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>II. Programs Determined Not to be UsedWe determine, based on verified information, that the programs listed belowwere not used by manufacturers, producers, or exporters in Singapore ofindustrial belts during the review period. For a full description of theseprograms, see our <T3>Preliminary Determination.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A.

Singapore Economic Development Board (EDB)<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should not usethe three-month rate on commercial bills as the benchmark for the calculationof the benefit from MAS loans because it is not representative of short-termfinancing in Singapore. Petitioner states that the mere comparability ofterms between MAS loans and commercial bills constitutes an insufficientbasis for selecting commercial bills as the benchmark. Moreover, commercialbills are no longer a predominant form of short-term financing and theyhave no reserve requirements, which petitioner argues is preferential.Respondents argue that the commercial bill rate is the appropriate benchmarkbecause the terms on commercial bills are most comparable to the financingterms on MAS loans. Respondents refer to the commercial bill benchmarkused in <T3>Final Negative Countervailing Duty Determinations: Certain TextileMill Products and Apparel from Singapore,</T3> (50 FR 9840, May 6, 1985)(<T3>Textiles) </T3>and statements made by officials in Singapore quotingcommercial bills as the most comparable alternative to MAS financing. Respondentsalso argue that overdrafts and short-term money market loans should notbe included in the benchmark because they are mainly used to finance non-commercialtransactions. In addition, respondents maintain that overdrafts are oftentreated as unsecured long-term loans and are, therefore, an inappropriatecomparison to MAS loans.<T3>DOC Position: </T3>Four types of short-term financial instruments areavailable to exporters in Singapore: commercial bills, overdrafts, short-termloans and trust receipts. None of the four types of financing representeda predominant form of short-term financing. Commercial bills, althoughthe alternative most comparable to MAS financing, represented less thansix percent of total short-term financing during the review period. Therefore,for our benchmark, we used a weighted average of the three types of short-termfinancing available exclusively in Singapore dollars, namely, overdrafts,short-term loans and commercial bills. This weighted average best representsthe market cost to an exporter of financing short-term cash needs. Trustreceipts were not included in our benchmark calculation because we didnot have adequate data on this type of financing. In addition, some ofthe financing in this category may be given in foreign currencies.We disagree with petitioner that commercial bills should not be includedin the benchmark calculation. They represent an alternative form of financingand should, therefore, be included in the weighted average. Petitionerhas not explained how reserve requirements make the calculated rates oncommercial bills preferential given our reliance on estimated spreads.We also disagree with respondents' assertion regarding overdrafts. Overdraftsare, by definition, a form of short-term financing, as are short-term moneymarket loans. As such, we included them in our benchmark calculation.<T3>Comment 2: </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department has not verifiedthe use or administration of Parts IX and X of the Economic Expansion IncentiveAct (EEIA) and that the Department should determine on the basis of bestinformation available that the program is contingent upon exporting andis a countervailable export program. Petitioner argues that a portion ofthe Ribstar poly-V belts manufactured by the respondent are industrialbelts within the scope of the investigation. Because respondent statedin the questionnaire response that benefits claimed under these sectionswere for a product outside the scope of this investigation, petitionerargues that total benefits claimed under these sections of the EEIA shouldbe considered as best information available and allocated over the productionof industrial belts.Respondents state that while the parent company, which is located in Japan,manufactures industrial Ribstar poly-V belts, the respondent company manufacturesonly automotive Ribstar poly-V belts. Therefore, any benefits claimed underParts IX and X of the EEIA are not within the scope of the investigation.Furthermore, the benefits that were claimed were for tax year 1988 whichis outside the period of investigation. <T3>DOC Position. </T3>We verified that the Ribstar poly-V belts manufacturedby MBS are automotive belts and not industrial belts and that the benefitsunder Parts IX and X of the EEIA were claimed outside the period of investigation.Furthermore, the benefits claimed under Part X of the EEIA did not pertainto the Randamp;D incentives under investigation.<T3>Comment 3:</T3> Petitioner argues that verification exhibits shouldbe released in their entirety based on the intent of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the Act of 1988), the Court's determinationthat computer tapes may be released under an administrative protectiveorder (APO), and prior ITA practice of releasing verification exhibits.Respondents argue that there is no basis for releasing business proprietaryverification exhibits. Respondents state that the section of the Act quotedby petitioner contains no mention of verification exhibits, nor does thelegislative history of the 1988 Act. Respondents furthermore state thataccess to verification exhibits has been limited to specific cases by thecourts.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> It is our policy not to release a respondent's supportingsource documents under an administrative protective order when we haverequested this additional information solely to further support respondents'claims. Release of such documents can be damaging to the competitive positionof the respondent. If petitioners did not agree with our position, theproper remedy was to appeal the refusal to the release of verificationexhibits under APO to the Court of International Trade (CIT) while thisinvestigation was in progress (19 U.S.C. 1677f(c)(2)).<T3>Comment 4:</T3> Petitioner asserts that, in its scope of investigationat the preliminary determination, the Department listed only four of the18 HTS items corresponding to the nine TSUSA numbers. Petitioner requeststhat the Department list all 18 HTS numbers in its final determination.<T3>DOC Position:</T3> The scope of this investigation has not changedsince the initiation. The petition included nine TSUSA item numbers and,at the time, four HTS sub-headings that petitioner believed would correspondto the TSUSA numbers when the HTS system would become effective.The Harmonized Tariff Schedule went into effect on January 1, 1989. Basedon a concordance between TSUSA item numbers and HTS sub-headings listedin the January 1989 ITC publication ``<T3>The Continuity of Import and Export Trade Statistics After Implementationof the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System</T3>'', petitionerrequested that the Department expand the four HTS sub-headings listed inour preliminary determination to eighteen sub-headings.We asked for comments from the interested parties in this investigationconcerning industrial belts covered by the eighteen HTS sub-headings. Wehave received no objections in this particular determination.In our preliminary determination, as now, we note that the written descriptionsof the products covered by the investigation is dispositive. The HTS numbersare provided for convenience and customs purposes as to the scope of theproduct coverage. Accordingly, we do not view this as a broadening of thescope of this investigation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances</ITAG>Petitioner alleges that ``critical circumstances'' exist within the meaningof section 703(e)(1) of the Act, with respect to imports of industrialbelts from Singapore. In determining whether critical circumstances exist,we must examine whether there is a reasonable basis to believe or supportthat (1) the alleged subsidy is inconsistent with the <T3>Subsidy Code,</T3> and (2) there have been massive imports of the subjectmerchandise over a relatively short period.Because we determine that the benefit provided to manufacturers, producers,or exporters of industrial belts in Singapore is <T3>de minimis,</T3> the final determination is negative. Therefore, criticalcircumstances do not exist.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>In accordance with section 776(b) of the Act, we verified the informationused in making our final determination. During verification, we followedstandard verification procedures, including meeting with government andcompany officials, inspecting documents and ledgers, tracing informationin the response to source documents, accounting ledgers, and financialstatements, and collecting additional information deemed necessary formaking our final determinations.<ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>Since Singapore is not a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaningof section 701(b) of the Act, section 303 of the Act applies to these investigations.However, Singapore is a signatory to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade. At the time of the preliminary determination, certain products includedin the scope of these investigations (<T3>i.e.,</T3> those classified under items 358.0610, 358.0690, 358.1400,657.2520, 773.3510 and 773.3520 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated</T3>) were nondutiable.However, on January 1, 1989, Singapore lost its Generalized System of Preferencestatus. Thus, all of the merchandise covered by this investigation is nowdutiable. Consequently, even if our final determination had been affirmative,the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) would not have been requiredto make a final injury determination in this proceeding.This determination is published pursuant to section 705(d) of the Act (19U.S.C. 1671d(d)).<ITAG tagnum="6">Timothy N.
