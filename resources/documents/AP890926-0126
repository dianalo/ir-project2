WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former HUD Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr.refused to answer questions Tuesday from a House panelinvestigating housing scandals, citing his constitutional rightagainst self-incrimination. He contended he had been ``prejudged bythis body.''   Pierce, compelled to appear by a subpoena, accused thesubcommittee of trying to rush him into testifying without adequatepreparation and said he hoped to tell his story later.   His refusal to testify came at a dramatic meeting of a panelthat has been investigating allegations of billions of dollarsworth of fraud, mismanagement, influence peddling and politicalfavoritism at the Department of Housing and Urban Development,which Pierce headed throughout the Reagan administration.   Disagreements between the subcommittee and Pierce even extendedto news coverage of the hearing. Pierce invoked House rules thatforced subcommittee chairman Tom Lantos, D-Calif., to bartelevision, radio and photographic coverage, despite the chairman'scomplaint that the move was unwarranted.   Pierce read a brief statement saying he had not had time toprepare, did not have the HUD documents he needed and would invokehis constitutional right not to testify.   Lantos then posed eight questions to Pierce, some raising newsuggestions of political influence involving HUD and the ReaganWhite House.   Each time Pierce refused to answer.   ``The subcommittee's desire to rush me through this process,together with various statements made by members ... leads me tothe painful conclusion that I have been prejudged by this body,''Pierce said.   ``Under these circumstances, my counsel has advised me and Ihave agreed to assert my constitutional rights under the Fifth andSixth Amendments by refusing to answer questions before thissubcommittee,'' he said. ``I trust this subcommittee will rememberthat these rights are intended as shields for the innocent and thatthey do not create any inference or presumption of wrongdoing.''   Paul L. Perito, his attorney, said he hoped Pierce would beready to testify on Oct. 27, the next date he has been orderedbefore the employment and housing subcommittee of the HouseGovernment Operations Committee.   But Perito, outside the committee room, told reporters thesubcommittee wanted wouldn't give Pierce a fair hearing and wantedto ``rush him to judgment.''   ``They want to try, convict and sentence him, and we will notlet that occur,'' Perito said. ``This man is an innocent man. ...This man wants very much to tell his story.''   Perito and Lantos engaged in a brief but heated exchange afterthe lawyer attempted to challenge the presence of three lawmakerswho are not members of the subcommittee.   Lantos said that under House rules Pierce's attorneys had noright to speak but only to advise their client.   ``In this hearing, you are in fact a potted plant,'' Lantos toldPerito _ a remark that recalled the 1987 Iran-Contra hearings whenOliver North's attorney, Brendan Sullivan, told a differentinvestigating committee, ``I am not a potted plant,'' something tobe ignored.   Pierce himself cited public comments about a need for a specialprosecutor, as well as comments by panel members alleginginconsistencies in his voluntary testimony last May, as evidence hehad been prejudged.   However, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Pierce had thrown``roadblocks in the way of the truth coming out. ... The longer hedoes it, the more he digs himself into a hole.''   A Republican on the subcommittee, Rep. Christopher Shays ofConnecticut, said before the hearing that if Pierce refused totestify he would support calling for the Justice Department toappoint a special prosecutor to investigate the former secretary.Lantos said after the meeting he was studying the issue.   Pierce delivered the same response to each of the eightquestions posed to him, a brief sentence citing his rights and hisattorney's advice. He sat expressionless, facing the panel. Asmembers criticized his refusal to testify, he occasionally closedhis eyes and shook his head slightly.   Lantos said Pierce may have waived his rights not to answer bytestifying voluntarily before the same subcommittee in May. Lantostold Pierce's lawyers to submit written arguments on the questionwithin a week.   Among the questions Lantos put to Pierce were ones about hisapproval, over the objection of other HUD officials, of money for ahousing project for elderly people in Durham, N.C.   Lantos also asked Pierce to explain an announcement bythen-President Reagan of the awarding of a HUD grant for housingfor the elderly during a New Jersey campaign appearance in 1982 onbehalf of the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate, MillicentFenwick.   The congressman questioned how that announcement was consistentwith Pierce's statement in his May testimony that the housingprogram was not run on a political basis.   `I can't see how it could be any more political,'' Lantos said.   Lantos showed copies of a Sept. 17, 1982, memo in which Piercewas informed by a deputy that ``the president, who is en route toNew Jersey, has agreed to fund, with Section 8 new constructionfunds,'' the 125-unit housing project for Ewing, N.J.   The subcommittee chairman said the New Jersey units were takenaway from the Durham project, which was later financed anyway.   The memo bears Pierce's initials and the handwritten word``noted.''   Lantos also showed a report on Reagan's appearance the followingday in the Trenton Times newspaper. The account said the project'sdeveloper didn't know HUD had approved the project until seeing iton an evening news program, and it quoted Reagan as saying afterhis announcement, ``If you don't elect her as senator we'll take itaway.''</TEXT></DOC>
