His instant answer: Open a bank.    &quot;He said it several times, very animated,&quot; recalls Sen. Charles Robb (D., Va.). &quot;He said, 'I want a bank, and it will have a big sign that says American Bank, and computers that link it directly to the U.S.'&quot;    In the wake of yesterday's historic assumption of power by a Solidarity prime minister, U.S. government officials have begun working on programs to nurture Poland's flight from communism. It is a sort of mini-Marshall Plan, designed to plant the seeds of capitalism -- such as a banking system -- in hopes of jump-starting sectors of the Polish economy. And it seeks to avoid the mistake of the 1970s, when the Western money that poured into Poland only delayed economic reform.    U.S. planners say they are focusing on specific economic targets:    --Banks. Even before Mr. Walesa's request to the senators, U.S. officials had discussed ways of getting U.S. banking expertise into Poland, citing Citibank's successful joint venture in Budapest as a model. Mr. Walesa maintains Poles have lost faith in their own government-controlled banks. &quot;He said there's $5 billion in that economy that they'd like to smoke out and put to work,&quot; says Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), who also visited Warsaw last week.    --Farming. While nearly all Polish industry is owned by the government, more than 70% of Polish farms are privately owned. Thus, administration officials believe agriculture may be an area where they can teach the Poles to operate more efficiently. The State Department already has been in contact with a foundation, established by David Rockefeller, that last year began a program to assist Polish pig farmers in exporting hams to the U.S.    --The World Bank. The U.S. has begun pushing the international lending institution to act on two project loans to Poland valued at $325 million. The loans have been pending for several years, but the bank's staff didn't push for approval because of the U.S. and other nations opposed loans for Communist Poland.    If the approach works, it could well become the working model for future Western efforts to respond to sweeping economic and political changes in Hungary, the Baltic states and even the Soviet Union itself.    In part, the administration's modest response is born of necessity. With its current budget deficit and other economic woes, the U.S. simply isn't in a position to provide Poland with aid on the scale of the post-World War II Marshall Plan. &quot;We've looked pretty hard at what resources are available,&quot; says Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger, &quot;and we have one hell of a budgetary problem.&quot;    Moreover, adds one official working on the Polish package, &quot;it's appropriate for Europe to take the lead on this&quot; because of its geographic and economic ties. Playing down the U.S. role also helps avoid provoking the Soviet Union into thinking the U.S. is taking advantage of the mounting turmoil in Moscow's empire.    The most important constraint on U.S. aid, though, is the bitter lesson learned from previous efforts to help Poland. Much of the $24 billion the West pumped into the Polish economy in the 1970s wound up being used to prop up inefficient industries, leaving the country with $40 billion in debt it can't repay.    &quot;The one thing the West should not do is repeat the mistake of the 1970s, and give cash to a child,&quot; says Polish journalist Andrzej Wroblewski, a fellow at the Wilson Center in Washington.    Before Western assistance can be of much help, experts agree, Poland must make major economic reforms on its own. The vast majority of Poles are employed by inefficient, state-controlled enterprises that are supported by continuous government subsidies. In an effort to curry favor with workers prior to last June's election, the government more than tripled those subsidies to accommodate wage rises, flooding the Polish economy with zlotys. The result was rampant inflation, running over 100% this year.    The International Monetary Fund has already quietly begun talks with Polish officials on crafting an economic reform plan, and new Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki has indicated he will carry through with plans to meet again with IMF officials next month.    But an IMF program certainly will involve curbing subsidies, cutting wages and allowing some inefficient industrial dinosaurs to fail. It's far from clear whether Solidarity, which has militantly opposed such measures in the past, can muster the political will to accomplish this task.    &quot;We have to be skeptical of what will go on because we have in power a government that primarily represents labor interests,&quot; says Jan Vanous of PlanEcon, a Washington economic consulting firm specializing in Eastern bloc nations. &quot;In the past, the objective of Solidarity has been to protect living standards and guarantee against a reduction in real wages. Now they must do just the opposite.&quot;    Once it's clear that economic reform is under way, the biggest infusion of Western cash could come in the form of relief on Poland's onerous debt. In his meeting with U.S. lawmakers, Mr. Walesa emphasized the need for debt relief, which he counts as a key part of the $10 billion package he has requested from the West.    The U.S. government holds only $2 billion to $3 billion of Poland's debt; most of it is owed to European governments. Nevertheless, Treasury officials have been pushing for an early refinancing. White House Chief of Staff John Sununu says the biggest dollar help for the Polish economy could come from debt relief, rather than direct government aid.    Polish officials are already working on a reform plan that would include a big dose of debt relief, according to U.S. businessman George Soros, who has close contacts with the Poles. He says that plan calls for reducing industrial subsidies, enacting currency reform, and creating a market-oriented economy for most commodities.    In return, Mr. Soros says, the Poles would like the West to declare a three-year moratorium on debt service, which totaled about $1.6 billion last year. They would also like to receive $1 billion from the IMF and between $600 million and $700 million from the World Bank in this period, plus an agreement from the European Community to open its market to Polish exports.    If that can be accomplished, Mr. Soros says, Poland could eventually attract substantial amounts of private foreign capital. U.S. officials agree that, despite the current state of its economy, Poland has many attractive qualities for foreign investors: a trained and educated work force, wage levels considerably below those of Western Europe and Hungary, a central location well suited to European trade, and rich farmland.    &quot;The main point is to emphasize that Poland is a dirt-cheap country,&quot; says Mr. Vanous. &quot;If you spend $100 million in the U.S. you don't get much. In Poland, you own a hell of a lot.&quot;    Many U.S. experts agree that an important first step toward capitalism in Poland would be the establishment of a private commercial banking system. That step was taken three and a half years ago in Hungary when Citibank opened the first private bank there. The bank, 80%-owned by Citibank with the rest held by the National Bank of Hungary, provides full banking services to Hungarian corporations. Such an operation in Poland would give private companies access to capital and help free them from the government subsidy system.    Establishing new private farm programs also will help. But ultimately Poland itself will have to create an environment where market forces guide economic behavior rather than the government.    &quot;Right now, they have economic apathy,&quot; says Paul Marer, professor of international business at Indiana University. &quot;They have to learn how to create a system and a psychology in which they can approach the productivity of the Polish people in Chicago.&quot;    (See related story: &quot;Mazowiecki Vows to Form Coalition Government Reflecting All Factions&quot; -- WSJ Aug. 25, 1989) </TEXT></DOC>
