The refugees fleeing the bombardment _ mostly women and children_ retreated Thursday and Friday about one-third of a mile from theircamp in Thailand's eastern Trat province, said the official, whorequested anonymity.   The Borai camp is about 2{ miles from the Cambodian border.   The official gave no report of casualties from the bombardment,which ended Saturday.   Gunners fired 30 mortar and artillery rounds in the attacks, theofficial said. The shelling is believed to have come from Vietnameseforces or those of Cambodia's Vietnamese-installed government.   The refugees will return to the camp they fled when authoritieshave determined the camp is ``again safe to re-enter and live,'' theofficial said in a telephone interview.   Military officials told a news conference Monday that 170artillery rounds crashed into the area near the camp during themonth that ended Monday, but said fighting along the border was lessintense compared to previous months.   Thai military officers previously said Vietnam has withdrawn sometroops 19 miles from the border area to ease tensions. On Monday,however, a military spokesman, Lt. Gen. Naruedol Dejpradiyuth,denied such a report, saying Vietnamese troops ``are now deployedalong the entire border.''   Sustained shelling along the border in November forced about5,000 Cambodians back to a U.N.-aided camp from which they had beenforcibly moved by communist Khmer Rouge guerrillas, who apparentlytried to populate areas just inside Cambodia.   The Khmer Rouge, which ruled from 1975 until Vietnam invaded inlate 1978, is the largest guerrilla group fighting the Vietnamese inCambodia. During its rule, it is estimated that about 2 million ofCambodia's 8 million people died from Khmer Rouge executions, famineand civil unrest.</TEXT></DOC>
