Now, with economiesslowing in Europe and Japan, several money managers say it'stime for export-minded investors to pick a narrower target:companies that ship goods to Latin America.   Exports have been an economic bright spot in a generallydismal U.S. economy. In the third quarter, exports grew at a6.4% annual clip, while the economy as a whole inched forwardonly 1.7%.</LP><TEXT>   But a number of investment professionals say that ashotgun approach to buying stocks of leading exporters islikely to flop next year. &quot;I think exports will add lessoomph in 1992&quot; because countries such as Germany and Japan&quot;seem to be weakening,&quot; says Charles Clough, chief investmentstrategist for Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.   He argues for a rifle shot, aimed south. &quot;I'd be playingLatin America,&quot; says Mr. Clough. &quot;Capital-goods exports toMexico have boomed,&quot; and would grow still more if Congresspasses a free-trade agreement with Mexico. Mr. Clough thinksthe pact is bound to be signed, within a few years if not in1992. He recommends Singer, which sells appliances andconsumer electronics (and, yes, sewing machines) throughoutLatin America.   Richard Welty, a portfolio manager with LaTeef ManagementAssociates in San Francisco, says he's excited about &quot;notjust Mexico, but also Chile, Argentina and Brazil.&quot; Heenvisions Latin American nations putting greater emphasis ondemocracy and free trade, and gradually climbing out fromunder the debt they accumulated in the 1970s.   As Mr. Welty sees it, Latin America &quot;may take up the slackif Europe is weak in 1992 and if Asia is less strong than ithad been. A big chunk of our trade deficit wouldn't be thereif Latin America were still purchasing at the level of the1970s.&quot;   His firm is emphasizing drug stocks. It owns shares inBristol-Myers Squibb, Johnson andamp; Johnson, Pfizer and Syntex,as well as British drug maker Glaxo. Other export stocks Mr.Welty holds are PepsiCo, Philip Morris and Emerson Electric.And he's taking a close look at food stocks such as CampbellSoup and CPC, which he thinks might benefit from increasedexports if the free-trade pact passes.   Douglas Campbell, president of D.A. Campbell, a SantaMonica, Calif., brokerage firm that specializes in Mexicanstocks, says U.S. drug makers would push into Latin Americain full force if the pending free-trade agreement with Mexicois passed. He says the pharmaceutical companies have been&quot;petrified of going into Latin America&quot; for fear that theirpatents won't be protected. But the free-trade agreement, henotes, contains provisions protecting intellectual property,such as drug patents.   That intellectual-property provision might also lead tohigher sales in Latin America by U.S. computer and softwarecompanies, he says. Several computer and semiconductorcompanies are among the U.S.'s largest exporters.   Mr. Campbell also puts in a good word for some Mexicanstocks he believes would benefit from free trade with theU.S. Cemex &quot;will make mincemeat&quot; out of U.S. cement companiesbecause of its lower costs, he says. Vitro will compete wellagainst U.S. glass makers, he predicts, and Internacional deCeramica will sell a lot of ceramic tile in the U.S.   Because free trade would boost travel between the twocountries, he also likes Aero Mexico, and to a lesser extentDelta Air Lines and American Airlines' parent AMR. Finally,he thinks the Mexican conglomerate Desc Sociedad de FomentoIndustrial (operating in such diverse fields as chickenfarming, auto parts, chemicals, food and real estate) wouldbenefit greatly from an opening of markets to the north.   Some money managers believe that exporters in general,regardless of any Latin American connection, should continueto thrive. Lou Acevedo of Galleon Capital Management inEncinitas, Calif., believes that the world-wide trend towardcapitalism will help exporters, and that the former SovietUnion and East Germany, with Western aid, will eventuallybecome big markets. He owns Caterpillar, Phelps Dodge andInternational Business Machines, and bought some more IBMstock on weakness last week.   Barton Biggs, director of world-wide strategy at MorganStanley, thinks the dollar is at a low enough level thatexporters should continue to do well next year. A weak dollarhelps exporters by making U.S. goods easier to sell abroad.It also magnifies the value, in U.S. currency, of foreignsales.   Mr. Biggs is optimistic about Latin America, but notmainly as an export market. &quot;If you're positive on LatinAmerica,&quot; he asks, why fool around with companies that onlyexport products to that part of the world? &quot;Why not just buythe Latin American companies?&quot;   Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative analysis atMerrill Lynch, says the 50 stocks with the highest foreignexposure in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index have outperformedthe index itself by about eight percentage points sincemid-1989, although in a &quot;choppy&quot; fashion. He expects thetrend to continue. &quot;If capitalism is one of the buzzwords ofthe 1990s, then this is a group to be in,&quot; he says.   Mr. Bernstein defines &quot;foreign exposure&quot; as the percentageof a company's revenue it earns abroad, whether by servingforeign markets directly or by exports. The 10 stocks on hislist with the highest foreign exposure are NL Industries (82%of sales abroad), Exxon (81%), Mobil (73%), InternationalFlavors andamp; Fragrances (69%), Cray Research (69%),Colgate-Palmolive (64%), Raychem (63%), Perkin-Elmer (63%),IBM (59%) and Millipore (58%).   But others contend that 1992 is the wrong time to play theexporters. &quot;I'm short some exporters right this minute,&quot; saysEd Levy, a partner at Levy Harkins andamp; Co. (A short sale is abet that a stock will decline.) The problem, as he sees it,is that most big exporters also happen to be cyclicalcompanies, and the U.S. is far from being out of therecession. He has sold short Caterpillar, Motorola and UnitedTechnologies, though his biggest shorts are in non-exporterssuch as banks and real-estate companies.   Robert Quasman, director of research at Legg Mason inBaltimore, says he doesn't view exporters in a negativelight, but &quot;it would no longer be as big a positive&quot; as itwas the past two years.   And Jim Melcher, president of Balestra Capital in NewYork, says he will like the shares of exporters some day, butnot now. He emphasizes the economic sluggishness in Europeand Japan, and says that, by contrast, the U.S. &quot;is comingout of this recession -- at least, I hope we are.&quot; ThirdWorld countries &quot;are looking much healthier than they have inyears,&quot; he says. But except for buying Aero Mexico in foreignaccounts, he doesn't currently see many ways he wants to cashin on that trend.   ---   QUANEX DEMONSTRATES how not to make an earnings forecast.The steelmaker's stock has been languishing ever since itsDec. 4 forecast of a &quot;break-even to marginally profitable&quot;first quarter.   What spooked investors was the 15-to-20-minute delay ofnews that began a two-hour-plus trading halt. Quanex blamesitself and New York Stock Exchange officials for bungling theannouncement.   William Cleary, Quanex's director of investor relations,says exchange officials imposed the trading halt withouttelling him, just five minutes after Mr. Cleary faxed them anadvance copy of his news release at 10:23 a.m. EST. Theexchange officials stopped trading at 10:28, and telephonedMr. Cleary about it two minutes later, a Big Board spokesmansays. He adds that Quanex should have been ready to discloseits news &quot;immediately&quot; after notifying the exchange.   But Mr. Cleary, citing &quot;chaos&quot; in his office because ofthe sudden trading halt, says it took at least 15 minutes torelay the forecast to business newswires. He adds: &quot;Whatthrew a monkey wrench into this was that no one here knew howto speed things up after the trading halt happened.&quot;   The delay &quot;definitely hurt the stock. It put a differentlight on the company's announcement; trading halts makepeople want to sell,&quot; says William Stephens, an analyst withRauscher Pierce Refsnes. &quot;Their first quarter is always theweakest, and we were expecting that.&quot; After the two-hour and10-minute halt, Quanex shares ended the day at 18 1/8, down 23/8; late yesterday, they were quoted at 18 1/4, off 1/8.   -- Robert Johnson</TEXT></DOC>
