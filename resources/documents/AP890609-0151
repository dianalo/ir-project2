Paul Simon, D-Ill.,after the Judiciary Committee on Thursday approved the bill, 12-2.   ``The driving element of our immigration system has been familyunification, and this only modestly shortens the backlogs. But itwill inject some new life and flexibility into a petrified system,''Simon said.   The measure provides for an overall immigration level of 600,000annually, the first such cap in U.S. history. It reflects thecurrent flow plus 110,000.   Under the two-track bill, about 480,000 visas would be reservedfor so-called family immigration, up from 436,000. A newlyestablished ``independent'' track for those with no current U.S.relatives would provide for aproximately 120,000 visas. Thatrepresents a jump in such immigration from a current level of about54,000 a year.   The bill had been stalled in the Judiciary Committee until acompromise under which lawmakers moved to keep at the current level_ 64,800 _ the number of brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizenspermitted as immigrants.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., had urged a cut to 21,600 in thatcategory while Simon called for an increase to 84,000.   Simpson and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. were co-sponsors ofthe original version while Simon offered a rival plan.   The compromise is expected to aid would-be immigrants from Asiancountries while the independent category was described bycongressional aides, who asked not to be identified by name, as aboon to immigrants from African nations and some European countries,including Ireland.   The bill combines existing visas for professionals, persons ofexceptional merit and those with needed skills with 54,000 new onesfor ``independent'' immigrants annually.   The 54,000 visas would be reserved for those qualifying under apoint-system, with points awarded for desirable attributes. At thelast minute, the committee voted to drop a provision that wouldaward 20 points to English language speakers. A number of lawmakersrecalled that their own relatives had arrived here without a commandof English.   Thus far the House has taken no action on the issue. Billssponsored by Reps. Howard L. Berman, D-Calif., and Hamilton Fish,R-N.Y., are pending.</TEXT></DOC>
