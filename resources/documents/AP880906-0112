(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker was given atwo-day extension Tuesday to come up with a $3 million down paymentas the first step of his $172 million proposal to buy thetelevision ministry's assets.   Bakker and PTL bankruptcy trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton said theywere still working out details of a contract for Bakker to buyassets of the ministry he gave up after a sex and money scandallast year.   The two men spoke with reporters after a one-hour meeting at theexecutive offices of Heritage USA, the entertainment, retail andhotel complex the ministry must sell as part of a Chapter 11reorganization.   ``The attorneys are still working on it and we hope to havesomething that's agreeable to everyone by tomorrow,'' said Benton,who had said on Friday that if the $3 million wasn't available byTuesday he would be forced to consider other bids.   Bakker said he was about ``$100,000 short'' of the $3 million incash and letters of credit. Benton said he was convinced Bakkerwould have the entire amount and gave him until Thursday to deliverit.   ``I'm thoroughly satisfied the $3 million line of credit, or itsequivalent, will be there,'' said Benton, who explained thatBakker's offer had been raised from $165 million to $172 million.   Benton had asked Bakker for the $3 million as a show of goodfaith in his plan to buy the Heritage USA Christian theme park, asatellite network and undeveloped property near the Fort Mill-basedministry.   Bakker, who left PTL in March 1987 after admitting to a sexualencounter with onetime church secretary Jessica Hahn, leads in thebidding to buy the assets of PTL.   Benton has given Bakker until Friday to present him with detailsof a financial deal between the former TV evangelist and anunidentified group of Greek businessmen. Benton said he willrecommend a buyer to U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds onSaturday.   The trustee said he has ``four or five'' other bids for PTLbesides the one by Bakker and a standing offer of $113 million byCanadian real estate executive Peter Thomas.   Bakker's offer may not be the only one presented to Reynolds onSaturday, Benton said, adding that any plan would be subject to acourt hearing before final approval.   On Friday, Benton had said he was ``very, very skeptical'' aboutwhether Bakker could complete the deal. He said Tuesday ``a lot hashappened over the weekend'' to change his thinking.   He dismissed suggestions that Bakker was being given a lot offlexibility in meeting court-mandated deadlines.   ``The judge is the one who sets the deadlines,'' Benton said.``He set it for Saturday. By Friday, he (Bakker) has to convinceeveryone that he has $77 million (as part of the purchase price).''   After a jubilant Bakker left Heritage USA on Tuesday, his wife,Tammy Faye Bakker, paid a surprise visit.   ``I'm so excited ... I feel like I've got a butterfly in mytummy,'' she told reporters.   Mrs. Bakker said she is confident her husband will be successfulin getting the ministry back and that they will get the support ofthe public.   ``I can look you in the eye and say we didn't misuse PTL orHeritage USA,'' she said.   Mrs. Bakker, a gospel singer, said she already was rehearsingher opening song for the day she and her husband again have atelevision program.   ``It will be `The Sun Will Shine Again,''' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
