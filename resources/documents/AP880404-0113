Barry, who ran a job-training program for Washington'sinner-city youth in 1968, said King's assassination led him tobelieve that civil rights progress _ and neighborhoodreconstruction _ would come faster.   ``Many are frustrated that we are celebrating changes that havecome all too slowly,'' Barry said. ``We haven't seen the rapidreinvestment in neighborhoods that we expected, but we have seensome progress.''   The new government center at which he spoke is one example ofchange, but buildings just across the street remain the burned-outshells they were after three days of rioting turned the capitalinto a city under siege.   Some sections of other neighborhoods have seen very littlerebuilding, and Barry blamed the slow reconstruction pace on a lackof promised federal and private financing.   The rioting laid waste to vast tracts of three largely blackneighborhoods, as the homes of black residents and the stores ofwhite merchants burned and businesses were looted.   The numbers associated with the riots are staggering: More than1,200 homes and businesses were burned, with property damageconservatively estimated at $24.7 million. More than 7,600 peoplewere arrested, most for looting; and 12 people were killed, mostwhen trapped in burning buildings.   Hospitals treated more than 1,200 injuries. More than 11,500federal troops reinforced the 2,800-member District of Columbiapolice department to quell the disturbances.   By the time order was restored, nearly 25 percent of the city'sthen-population of 810,000 needed some form of assistance.   Reflecting on the outpouring of anger and violence followingKing's death, some city leaders still seem startled by thevehemence of the protest.   ``When the riots got started, it caught everyone by surprise,''said Sam Jordan, a city official who lived a block from where theriots started, about two miles north of the White House.   ``The tension was there, but we had followed Dr. King'sphilosophy of non-violence. When he was assassinated, the angercame out.''   David Clarke, the District of Columbia Council chairman, thinksit wrong that some think of the riots and King at the same time.   Calling King's philosophy and the riots ``moral antitheses,''Clarke said progress in Washington since 1968 is ``not the resultof a riot. It is the result of a movement.''   Many of Washington's political leaders were active in the civilrights movement, and worked for changes on both the local andnational level following King's death.   An elective school board replaced a federally appointed panel in1968, and Washington residents earned the right to elect their ownmayor and city council in 1974.   ``The (civil rights) movement was the major source of strengthfor our evolving lives,'' Barry said. ``We worked hard, we livedhard. Always, Dr. King was a great inspiration to all of us.''</TEXT></DOC>
