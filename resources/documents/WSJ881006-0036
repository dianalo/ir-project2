The plan, which ties pay increases to profit increases, represents Du Pont's most drastic step to date toward shedding its image as a cumbersome, benign employer and becoming a slim, aggressive competitor in the chemical industry. Du Pont also is one of the first companies of such size and stature to consider this kind of comprehensive pay plan during profitable times.    Pay incentives for managers have become common in many companies in recent years, but compensation experts say Du Pont's approach of applying such incentives to lower level supervisors and rank-and-file workers is still far from commonplace. Moreover, while the automobile and steel industries have adopted comprehensive incentive plans as cost-cutting measures, Wilmington, Del.-based Du Pont said its plan is different because it doesn't seek wage cuts.    Du Pont's concept is to tie the salaries of all 20,000 employees in the fibers business, from group vice president to hourly workers, to the unit's profitability. It will work like this:   After a phase-in period of five years, fibers employees will be paid base salaries that are 6% lower than their counterparts in the rest of Du Pont receive. The fibers workers will recoup the 6% difference only if the unit meets 100% of its profit goals.    The employees don't collect any of the 6% difference if the fibers group makes less than 80% of its profit goals. At the 80% level, employees get a 3% pay raise. If the unit reaches 150% of its goal, employees receive a bonus that makes their salary 12% higher than their counterpart's.    The purpose of this plan, Du Pont officials said, is to reinforce its new &quot;team spirit&quot; and to make employees feel that they have a stake in how the business fares.    &quot;I'm looking for people to want to have more ownership in the business,&quot; said James F. Kearns, Du Pont's group vice president, fibers. Added Steven E. Gross, general manager of Hay Associates and an architect of the plan, &quot;There's a whole change in how people view employees. They're asking people to work harder, and now they're asking them to share the fruits of their labor.&quot;    An advantage to such an approach is flexibility. Management can avoid big increases in fixed costs while doing more to reward performance. Robert C. Gore, a Philadelphia-based vice president and compensation consultant for Towers Perrin Co.'s TPFandamp;C unit, notes that many corporate managers have felt constrained in the 1980s by small merit-raise budgets. &quot;They're uncomfortable giving many employees zero so they can give a few people 12% raises,&quot; he said.    At Du Pont, extra pay earned for a year will take the form of one-time bonuses paid in February of the next year, not permanent increases in base salaries. Fibers employees' base pay will move in lock step with those of other Du Pont workers as they continue to receive annual company raises. Those raises, however, will represent only 94% of what others receive to maintain the 6% difference.    In salary terms, a manager earning $94,000 at the end of the phase-in period has a counterpart in another part of the company earning $100,000. The fibers manager will receive $100,000 only if the unit makes 100% of its projected profit goal. He'll make only $94,000 if profits come in at less than 80%. He stands to make $112,000, however, if 150% of the goal is met.    For Du Pont, the plan means a payroll savings of $36 million a year if less than 80% of the profit goal is met. It also means a payout of $72 million in new cash bonuses if profits reach 150%.    News of the plan immediately generated some criticism from union officials representing about 6,000 of the fibers unit's hourly employees. The officials said they consider the plan unfair if workers don't have any voice in setting the profit goals and the mechanics of the plan.    They also think it's unfair to tie salaries to profits when the level of profits may have nothing to do with individual performance. Profits, for example, could sink in a general economic recession.    &quot;How about job guarantees if the workers are going to put their pay at risk?&quot; asked Kenneth Henley, an attorney for the union.    Towers Perrin's Mr. Gore warned of other potential dangers in such plans. &quot;Effective communication with employees is absolutely essential,&quot; he said. &quot;The employees have to trust the numbers, they have to believe this isn't really an illusory reward or a pay cut in disguise. Otherwise the ship is sunk before it leaves the harbor.&quot;    Du Pont said such criticisms are legitimate concerns, but noted that workers will benefit from good times that also have nothing to do with performance. In addition, Mr. Gross, the Hay consultant, said even low-ranking employees can make a big difference in the profitability of an operation, by seeking ways to reduce material waste, for example, or by saving money on repairs to equipment.    &quot;We want people to think of more than just their own little job. This provides direct reinforcement,&quot; Mr. Gross said.    Du Pont said it will propose the plan to the union and bargain on it. If the union rejects it, the plan will procede without choice for the operation's remaining 14,000 non-union employees, and union workers will be exempted.    The fibers division is one of Du Pont's most profitable businesses, generating after-tax operating profit last year of $624 million on sales of $5.3 billion. Sales are expected to reach $6 billion this year with an after-tax operating profit goal of $626 million.    Du Pont had total profit of $1.78 billion, or $7.39 a share, last year on sales of $30.5 billion.    Excluding inflation, Mr. Kearns said he expects 4% average annual profit growth for the fibers business in the next five to 10 years. Goals will be set accordingly, he said. The unit has about doubled its profit margin since 1983 by markedly reducing the number of employees (to 20,000 from 27,000) and by increasing productivity. Profits have also been boosted recently by the success of products like Stainmaster carpet and fibers like Kevlar, Nomex and Tyvek.    Mr. Kearns acknowledged that the fibers operation is considered a mature business and one that is vulnerable to a general economic recession if one should occur. He said, however, that he expects to maintain growth by increasing production capacity for current products and by introducing new uses for those products.    He said his division developed the pay-incentive plan with Hay and requested that it be implemented. He doubts it will be used eventually by the entire Du Pont company, though it may serve as a model for other operations considering similar possibilities. </TEXT></DOC>
