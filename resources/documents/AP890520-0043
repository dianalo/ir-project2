He said a group of 400 soldiers crossed the Moei River boundaryinto Mae Sot's Ban Wangkaew village, which has been evacuated dueto the fighting, to set up heavy weapons to shell the camp. Some ofthem also seized control of a road about five miles from Mae Sot,he said.   Thai forces fired into the village, but the Burmese soldiersstill remained in the evening, said the officer, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   A 64-year-old Thai man was wounded in the clash, and Thaisoldiers and paramilitary personnel were sent in as reinforcements.   The officer said Thai forces fired artillery rounds as warningsto a second group of 100 Burmese soldiers who crossed into anotherarea of Mae Sot.   ``They are attacking across the river and fighting us from theThai side,'' said a Karen official who asked not to be named. Hesaid the offensive was the largest since 1977 and that thousands ofKaren civilians had fled to Thailand.   The Thai officer said other Burmese troops perched on two hillsin Burma continued attacking Kaw Moo Ra with heavy shells today,setting much of the Burmese camp ablaze. Fierce fighting wasreported in one part of the camp.   He estimated that 1,200 guerrillas were defending the campagainst about 3,000 soldiers.   Thailand in the past has given sanctuary to the rebels, but theBangkok government has sent top level delegations to Burma todiscuss the situation. Last year, the military government in Burmakilled hundreds of Burmese during widepsread demonstrations fordemocracy.   After putting down the demonstrations, the Burmese army renewedits battle with the Karens, who began their revolt in 1949, theyear after Burma achieved independence from Great Britain. Therebels said at the time that the government reneged on its promiseof more autonomy for ethnic minorities.   The Karen National Union has an estimated 4,000 combatants andis the largest of the 10 ethnic insurgent groups in the NationalDemocratic Front.   Kaw Moo Ra is in Karen State and is 140 miles east of Rangoon,the Burmese capital. Government forces began shelling it Thursday,two days after overrunning the major rebel base of Wangkha, abouttwo miles to the south.   Wangkha was the fifth Karen stronghold to be captured by armyunits since the government launched a bloody dry season offensivein October. A government spokesman said Friday in Rangoon that atleast 43 rebels were killed in the battle for Wangkha. He said 35soldiers were killed and 95 wounded.   The five captured camps are in a 75-mile arc hugging the borderalong Mae Sot district in Thailand's northern province of Tak.   Thai officials say the Burmese offensive has disrupted thecross-border black market trade that provided the Karens with fundsfor their insurgency.</TEXT></DOC>
