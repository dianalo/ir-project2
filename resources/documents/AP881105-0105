Riot police in Seoul fired tear gas to block a 10,000-strongcrowd from marching to the former president's house. The protestersbrandished rocks and threw firebombs.   At least 11 officers were injured, authorities said, including 10hurt when a police station in Seoul was pelted with rocks andfirebombed. Dozens of protesters were seen injured and carried away,but police gave no figures for the total number of injuries andarrests.   Tear gas filled the streets of seven other South Korea cities _Wonju, Chunchon, Cheju, Kwangju, Taegu, Taejon and Pusan _ as policefought students at anti-Chun rallies, authorities reported.   The scandal over corruption allegedly committed by Chun and hisfamily has become the major political issue in South Korea since theSummer Olympics in Seoul. On Saturday, three opposition groupsrejected a governing party offer for Chun to make a public apologyfor his alleged misdeeds in office.   Students in Seoul burned effigies of Chun, President Roh Tae-wooand Uncle Sam, and thousands of citizens cheered and shouted``Arrest Chun Doo-hwan!''   Roh was elected in December to replace Chun, who held officeseven years. The election followed months of anti-governmentdemonstrations.   In Pusan, an opposition stronghold south of Seoul, police firedtear gas at thousands of protesters trying to burn an effigy of theformer president after a street march, according to Yonhap, theSouth Korean news agency.   Police also battled groups of slogan-chanting protesters inKwangju, after students razed two police buses, shattered dozens ofwindows and damaged eight cars in a firebomb attack on a governmentprosecutors' building.   One student was injured when he fell out of a third-floor window.   In Seoul, police martial arts squads drove protesters into sidestreets, beating and kicking them, but the protest swelled withthousands of other citizens demanding Chun's arrest.   Thousands of riot police using armored vehicles fired volleys oftear gas at more than 15,000 protesters at one crowded shopping area.   At least 10 police officers were hurt when students hurled rocksand scores of firebombs into a police station in Seoul.   A police officer was injured on the southern outskirts of Seoulwhen students attacked an office of the governing Democratic JusticeParty with firebombs.   During the Seoul rally Saturday, dissident leaders called forbigger rallies next week and vowed to attack Chun's house.   Radical students have launched attacks on government buildingsand party offices since Thursday, when riot police blocked a marchto Chun's home by thousands of students.   The governing party, in a move aimed at ending the protests,proposed Saturday that Chun apologize or respond to allegations ofcorruption and misrule, but opposition leaders rejected the offerand demanded an investigation.   Chun's younger brother, Chun Kyung-hwan, was recently sentencedto seven years' in prison for taking bribes and misusing millions ofdollars in government money while he headed a rural developmentprogram.   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980, also is beinginvestigated for his alleged role in putting down a 1980 civiluprising in Kwangju. By official count, about 200 people died in themilitary suppression of the nine-day uprising.   Roh, a former military general and a friend of Chun, arrived inAustralia on Saturday to begin a four-day visit and did not commenton the disturbances.</TEXT></DOC>
