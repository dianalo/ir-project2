JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawsuit filed Monday alleges that theEnvironmental Protection Agency has failed to develop nationalstandards for discharging toxic pollution into public waterways asrequired by law.   As a result, according to the lawsuit filed in U.S. DistrictCourt by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Public Citizen,millions of pounds of toxic wastes are unregulated.   The lawsuit asks the federal courts to direct the EPA to developa plan for limiting a broader range of toxic pollution than iscovered by federal regulations.   ``Over two-thirds of the industrial facilities that releasetoxics into our waterways are not covered by nationwide EPAregulations, but by a weak system of site-specific permits,'' saidRobert Adler, an attorney for the NRDC, a Washington-basedenvironmental organization.   EPA spokeswoman Alicia Tenuta said the agency had no immediatecomment on the lawsuit because officials have not seen it.   The suit, using data filed by industry to the EPA on 1987 toxicemissions, said an estimated 70 million pounds of unregulated toxicwastes are released annually into surface waters and sewers from avariety of industries ranging from parmaceutical companies tomining, iron and steel and texile operations.   Eric Glitzenstein, an attorney for Public Citizen, said many ofthose toxic releases come from companies that are in business totreat hazardous wastes.   ``The hazardous waste treatment industry is perhaps the mostastonishing example of an industry that escapes nationwide toxicpollution controls,'' Giltzenstein said.   ``Ironically, these facilities are cleaning up polluted land andgroundwater at hazardous waste sites, only to release equallydangerous wastes into our waters.''   The lawsuit alleges that the EPA has failed to live up torequirements under the Clean Water Act and the ResourceConservation and Recovery Act to establish in a timely fashion aregulatory plan for controlling the discharge of hazardous wasteinto public waterways.</TEXT></DOC>
