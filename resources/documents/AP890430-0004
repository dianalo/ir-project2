It was the second day of meetings between students and officialsin response to student demands for talks with the government onfreedom of the press, human rights and official corruption.   The students have pressed their demands during the past twoweeks by holding the largest protest marches in 40 years ofCommunist rule. They also have boycotted classes for a week, andactivists from the nearby city of Tianjin said students at twoschools there have joined the boycott.   The official Xinhua news agency reported Sunday's meeting butdid not say if students were protesters or members of officialstudent associations that most students now reject.   The students have set up their own student unions and insistthat the government talk with them. The government has said the newgroups are illegal.   A meeting between student representatives and governmentofficials also took place Saturday, but students said itaccomplished nothing.   Xinhua said Sunday's meeting was between 29 students from 16Beijing colleges and municipal leaders, including Mayor Chen Xitongand party secretary Li Ximing.   It said a student asked ``whether students who are party membersand who have taken part in the demonstrations and boycott of classwill be punished.'' Li said they would not be, Xinhua reported.   Li and Chen, acting on student demands, both revealed theirmonthly incomes were about $80, or about 50 percent more than theaverage factory worker. Chen also denied he won his post throughnepotism.   Special privileges for officials and corruption have been keytargets of the students since they began their protests April 15.   So far, most of the protest activity has been limited to thecapital, although smaller marches have been reported in othercities. Tianjin is the only other city where a large-scale classboycott has been reported.   A Tianjin University activist said the boycott began April 24,the same day as in Beijing, and that 90 percent of Nankai studentsand 70 percent of Tianjin University students were taking part.   He said about 10,000 students marched peacefully Friday in theport city 68 miles east of Beijing to show support for Beijingstudents who marched the previous day.   About 150,000 students and ordinary citizens joined in theBeijing march.   The mayor of Tianjin, Li Ruihuan, is among officials who havebeen criticized by students in Beijing for allegedly having gottenhis job through nepotism. Li is the son-in-law of Wan Li, thechairman of the National People's Congress.   A Nankai University student said school officials were warningupperclassmen they will not be assigned good jobs if they boycottclass.   Beijing students, meanwhile, continued to denounce Saturday'smeeting with central government officials as inadequate. Theofficials took a conciliatory tone but urged them to return toclass.   ``It was regrettable,'' said Wang Dan, one of the leaders ofBeijing University's new student association. ``It wasn't adialogue _ it was more like a news conference with the studentsplaying reporters and asking questions.''   ``The government is still cheating us,'' read a student posterat the school. ``Continue boycotting to protest the government'sinsincere dialogue,'' said another.   Wang and other leaders said the boycott would continue at leastthrough Thursday, the 70th anniversary of China's first studentpro-democracy movement. The students have said they will holdanother march then.   However, some student leaders expressed fears they would bearrested before Thursday in a government effort to head off furtherembarrassing marches.</TEXT></DOC>
