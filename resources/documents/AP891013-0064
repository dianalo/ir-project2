An institute for the blind in London was among the victims,although it apparently was infected with a previously known virus,not the so-called Columbus Day virus that was seen for the firsttime when it was activated by computers' internal clocks at 12:01today.   Ross M. Greenberg, a security specialist in New York and creatorof the Flu-Shot Plus and Virex-PC anti-viral software, said atmidmorning that he had received seven reports of virus strikessince midnight, but only one was the Columbus Day virus.   He said 12 personal computers at Columbia University in New YorkCity were affected, but that the university had made backup filesand was merely inconvenienced.   Several officials at Columbia today said they were unable toconfirm the report, and Greenberg acknowledged the information wasnot first-hand.   The other six virus reports Greenberg received were of theso-called PLO virus, an older virus designed to erase programsevery Friday the 13th. Greenberg had said earlier that the PLOvirus was far more widespread and likely to cause more troubletoday than the new Columbus Day virus.   In Britain, the Royal National Institution for the Blindreported that it was struck by a virus.   ``We found that most of our program files are gone. Every timewe try to look at a new program file it vanishes in front of oureyes,'' said Corri Barrett of the institute in London. ``It'shorrendous. Months and months of work has been wiped out here.''   Barrett said in a BBC-TV interview that the virus might havecontaminated disks distributed to blind clients and that theirsystems had been infected.   Greenberg said the virus was almost certainly the PLO virus.   The Columbus Day virus, also called the Datacrime virus, doesnot erase files but is programmed to scramble indexing informationin IBM or IBM-compatible personal computers. It would be theequivalent of removing a library's card catalog.   Computer viruses, created by anonymous programmers, are piecesof software that make copies of themselves and spread from onemachine to another through infected floppy disks, office networksor phone links such as computer bulletin boards.   Once activated, the rogue program copies itself like a breedinggerm, eating away processing power and storage space or destroyinginformation. About 30 viruses are known to exist, not countingstrains and mutations.   Fears of a virus could be beneficial if they get people to``think of making backup files as readily as they think of wearingseat belts,'' said Martha Brothers of ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories.   Alex Williams, receptionist at IBM Corp.'s regional marketingand service center in Baltimore, said he had received no reports ofa virus infection with the company's equipment or from areacustomers this morning.   ``Usually if anything like that happens, we get a message, and Ihaven't seen a thing,'' Williams said.   In Switzerland, Bernhard Schmid, head of the federal personalcomputer team, said several dozen of the government's 3,500personal computers were found to have been carrying a virus butthat experts managed to cancel and reprogram all infected programs.He said infected programs had been found in a wide range ofadministrative branches.   The Portuguese news agency Lusa said the Portuguese ComputingAssociation was informed of two viral outbreaks today, but theywere both strains that appeared previously. A leading bank and amedium-size industrial concern were affected, Lusa said. It did notidentify the companies.   Last November, a virus spread through a computer network sharedby colleges, research centers and the military. It took severaldays to cleanse the 60,000 computers in the network affected by thevirus, which had multiplied out of control, overloading thememories of the computer systems it invaded.   Since March, a dozen cases of the Columbus Day virus have beenfound dormant in computers when people noticed that some of theirfiles had swollen inexplicably. Infected programs were turned overto experts who dismantled the virus and found out when it would betriggered.   ``We want to send a calming message to people that if they takereasonable precautions, this virus poses no more danger than anyother,'' said Thomas P. Malarkey, deputy chief of the NationalComputer Security Center.   Said Greenberg: ``All the people I consider to be respectable inthe anti-virus community have a similar opinion to mine, that theDatacrime virus has been blown way out of proportion by anunknowledgeable media.''</TEXT></DOC>
