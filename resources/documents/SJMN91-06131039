Harold Pinter suppliedthe crafty screenplay. Paul Schrader lent his detached &quot;European&quot; eye asdirector. Risk-takers Christopher Walken and Helen Mirren signed on as thenaughty strangers, who, like evil parents in a Brothers Grimm story, suckeryoung travelers into their ornate web.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Weekend  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SINISTER 'STRANGERS'THE DEADLY GAMES PEOPLE PLAY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Film Reviews  </MEMO><TEXT>     Given the interests and proclivities of the talent involved, it should comeas no surprise that &quot;The Comfort of Strangers&quot; (opening today) is a bleaklyfunny, intellectual thriller with S andamp; M overtones. Like Schrader's masterful&quot;Mishima&quot; and Pinter's confounding &quot;The Servant,&quot; the film dwells on questionsof sexual identity.;    Colin and Mary, the young couple on holiday, arehandsome and fit. They could have stepped from an escape-to-paradise travelposter. Who would guess that Colin is a closet bisexual, Mary disdainsrelationships in general and both are in a quiet panic, two lost soulswandering through a maze of dark streets?;    Dark desires; Colin (RupertEverett) and Mary (Natasha Richardson of Schrader's &quot;Patty Hearst&quot;) are ripefor plucking. The year's most bizarre couple, Robert (Walken) and Caroline(Mirren), oblige by setting an elaborate trap and bidding the foreverdisoriented Britishers welcome. Colin and Mary, though very much on theirguard, can't resist -- either the hospitality or the vague promise ofsomething sinister and exciting.;    How you respond to &quot;Comfort&quot; will dependon how you feel about Walken, whose well-fixed Canadian-Italian always seemsto be doing a bad impression of Marcello Mastroianni in &quot;Divorce, ItalianStyle,&quot; right down to the twitching eye. Walken's Robert is scary andhilarious, as much a mama's-boy fop as a master insinuator. Little wonder Maryand Colin are confused: They can't decide if he's a fool or a menace.;    Asfor Robert's wife, Caroline, she's a little too friendly, spewing her deepestthoughts and fears before tea is served. She can't resist telling her gueststhat she crept into their room while they slept and marveled at their nudebodies -- well, actually, Colin's godlike physique.;    For those not attunedto Pinter's elliptical exchanges and Schrader's deliberate decadence, therewill be a strong urge to echo Mary's impatient, &quot;So what's the point?&quot;Already, critics around the country have dismissed this film as a ludicrousgame of cat-and-mouse. Luchino Visconti's &quot;Death in Venice&quot; meets NicolasRoeg's &quot;Don't Look Now,&quot; anyone?;    Don't be put off by such flip appraisals.&quot;Comfort,&quot; when embraced on its own terms, proves as dark and sinuous asVenice's maze-like back alleys. It's about the traps we inadvertently springon ourselves by being either too circumspect in our sexuality or too flagrant.The young couple and their neurotic host, who's fixated on a bullying fatherwith a waxed &quot;mootache,&quot; are opposite sides of the same bent coin.;    Stylewars;  If there's a problem here, it's the strange amalgam of styles. ThePinter script is sarcastic and badgering; Schrader's direction, like thesatin-y photography and Mahler-moody music, is ersatz classical. The Britishactors are understated and testy while Walken plays the flamboyant poseur,like Orson Welles in &quot;The Third Man.&quot; But who cares? The end product ishypnotic, disturbing and impossibly romantic.;    Thomas Mann, say hello toAlfred Hitchcock.;     The Comfort of Strangers; (star)(star)(star) 1/2; Rated: R (nudity, violence); Cast: Christopher Walken, Natasha Richardson,Rupert Everett; Director: Paul Schrader; Writer: Harold Pinter  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GLENN LOVELL, Mercury News Film Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910510  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  586  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday May 10, 199100131039,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
