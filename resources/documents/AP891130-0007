SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pentagon, as President Bush departs forthe Malta summit with Mikhail Gorbachev, says it will move aheadwith plans making the giant MX nuclear missile a rail-mountedweapon.   The 50 intercontinental ballistic missiles _ which are to bestored at military sites scattered around the country and moved ontrains during times of crisis _ are designed to launch adevastating retaliation in the face of any Soviet attack.   The Air Force announced Wednesday that the 50 missiles inunderground silos in Wyoming will be moved to ``garrisons,'' orshelters, at military installations in Wyoming, Louisiana, Texas,Washington, North Dakota, Arkansas and Michigan.   The dispersal will allow the weapons to survive a surprisestrike, the Air Force argued, as well as provide ``the potentialfor prompt retaliation vital to the successful deterrence of war.''   The new system is expected to be completed by 1994, the AirForce said.   The Soviets have two land-based mobile ICBMs, the SS-25 andSS-24.   The 50 MX missiles _ dubbed the ``Peacekeeper'' by formerPresident Reagan _ will be placed on 25 trains, each with two MXmissiles aboard. The trains will be kept on seven Air Force basesand moved onto civilian railroad tracks in time of crisis.   The announcement came Wednesday as Bush prepared to depart forhis Malta meeting with Gorbachev. Secretary of State James A. BakerIII said the meeting will permit the leaders ``to be in much bettershape and much better prepared'' to reach an agreement on slashingsuch long-range weaponry at their second summit set for next year.   U.S. and Soviet leaders have expressed hopes of signing anagreement at that later meeting to cut strategic weapons by as muchas 50 percent.   But Wednesday's announcement also represents the Bushadministration's commitment to push ahead with plans to modernizethe nation's strategic nuclear missile force, even amid projectionsof Pentagon belt-tightening, heightened prospects for arms-controlagreements and sweeping changes in the Soviet Union and its WarsawPact allies.   The new basing system is the latest step in the controversialmissile's 18-year history.   The MX _ which stands for missile experimental _ was firstproposed in 1971. In its early development, it was seen as a mobilemissile designed to prevent the Soviets from knowing where to aimto destroy it.   Subsequently, the Air Force studied more than 30 ``basingmodes,'' including trucking it around the country, submerging it inlakes, or keeping it airborne on special planes.   In 1979, President Carter proposed shuttling the weapon on``racetracks'' in southern Utah and eastern Nevada, but Reaganrejected that plan in 1981.   Congress, in a four-year battle with the administration, slashedReagan's request for 100 of the missiles to 50, and they wereplaced in hardened underground silos. In 1986, Reagan proposedshifting to the rail-based system advocated by the Air Force.   Earlier this year, Bush opted to move forward with two mobileintercontinental ballistic missile systems by putting the10-warhead MX on trains while also building the smaller,truck-based Midgetman.   Bush's decision has run into considerable opposition in Congress_ both among those who contend the two-prong program is tooexpensive and among those who favor one weapon or the other.   Bush signed a military spending bill last week that establishesa $1.1 billion fund for both the MX and the Midgetman, with theexact spending split left to Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.   The cost of taking the nation's 50 MX missiles out of theirunderground silos at Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming and buildingthe new ``garrisons,'' or shelters, is expected to be at least $5.6billion, said a Pentagon source who requested anonymity.   ``Hopefully, it will be completed by 1994, but that clearlydepends on the budget,'' the source said.   The Pentagon said the missile trains will be housed at Warrenand these other Air Force bases: Barksdale in Louisiana, Dyess inTexas, Fairchild in Washington, Grand Forks in North Dakota, LittleRock in Arkansas and Wurtsmith in Michigan.   Warren AFB will be the center of the MX operation and thetraining site for the garrison crews.</TEXT></DOC>
