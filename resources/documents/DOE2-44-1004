The program has three major components:a specification of the location and the statistical characteristics ofthe organisms or conditions, a sampling, and a computation of statisticaltests. With PLOTSAM, the location of the organisms or site conditionscan be specified as a systematic or bivariate normal distribution, andthe attributes can have a normal, lognormal, uniform, or triangular distribution.Furthermore, sampling can be performed by placing quadrats randomly orsystematically along one or more transects in a square plot. Descriptivestatistics of the complete and sampled data sets can be examined. Thenstatistical tests can be performed to compare the complete and sampleddata sets. The advantage of using a simulation for sampling is that thesampled information can be compared to the complete population and thatthe accuracy and precision of the sampling methods thus can be tested.Knowledge of the adequacy of the sampling regime is otherwise difficultto obtain in many ecological studies because the populations are frequentlyso large that collecting all of the measurements is not feasible. UsingPLOTSAM, a test is performed to examine the effects on the estimatesof the mean and the variance when the number of samples is increasedand different distributions of the attribute are simulated. This testwas parameterized with values obtained from a sampling of available soilnitrogen with ion exchange resin bags. The simulations suggest that theincrease in accuracy associated with an increase in sample number isrelated to the skewness and kurtosis of the true population. 16 refs.,8 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
