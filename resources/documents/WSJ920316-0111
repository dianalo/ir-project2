Outraged over best-picture nominations for &quot;JFK&quot; and &quot;TheSilence of the Lambs,&quot; and the release this coming Friday of&quot;Basic Instinct&quot; -- all of which feature homosexual villains-- gay-rights groups are demanding that Hollywood change itsways. They are forcing the industry to listen by usingdeliberately strident tactics, with huge demonstrationsplanned for the &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; opening and the AcademyAwards ceremony March 30.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I don't understand why they continue to make us out asmonsters, maniacs and psychopaths,&quot; says Pam Bates, a lesbianactivist in San Francisco who is part of a group plottingways to ruin the box-office prospects of &quot;Basic Instinct,&quot; a$40 million thriller from Carolco Pictures Inc. featuring anice-pick-wielding bisexual woman as its villain.   Since the movie is a murder-mystery, the group figures thebest way to keep filmgoers away is to tell them whodunit. &quot;Idon't want them to make any money on this film,&quot; says Ms.Bates, who, like hundreds of other protesters in New York andLos Angeles will be distributing leaflets outside movietheaters this weekend, giving away the ending. Protesters inLos Angeles already have pasted stickers across movie postersfor &quot;Basic Instinct,&quot; proclaiming it &quot;another homophobicfilm.&quot; Not since William Friedkin's 1980 movie &quot;Cruising,&quot;about homosexual murders in Greenwich Village, has the gaycommunity been so outraged over a film.   There is doubt whether the spoiler campaign will keep manyviewers away, especially since the film ends on an ambiguousnote. And the publicity doubtless will attract curiousmoviegoers who might not otherwise see the film. MikeMedavoy, chairman of Sony Corp.'s TriStar Pictures unit,which is distributing the movie, says, &quot;This is a terrificthriller, and I hope a lot of people will see it in the lightin which it was intended, not in the narrow light in whichit's cast by others.&quot;   The &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; furor, which grew as demonstratorstried to disrupt filming last year in San Francisco, is thefocal point of much wider unrest. The gay-activist groupQueer Nation has been staging demonstrations at recentHollywood awards ceremonies, handing out fliers demanding &quot;NoAwards for Homo-Hatred.&quot; The group says it will cap itsefforts with a &quot;Queer Caravan&quot; to the Oscars that it hopeswill draw a few thousand protesters from around the country-- as well as a TV audience of a billion world-wide.   In addition to the best-picture nominations, gay groupsare annoyed that the academy overlooked films with positivegay characters, particularly the critically acclaimeddocumentary &quot;Paris Is Burning,&quot; about black transvestites inHarlem. &quot;The fact that the subject matter was deemed `lessimportant' than other subject matters makes it crystal clearthat the {nominating} committee's homophobia was a leadingreason&quot; the documentary wasn't tapped, insists SpenceHalperin, a producer and member of Out in Film, a group ofabout 500 openly gay and lesbian workers in the entertainmentindustry.   &quot;We're upset about the negative representation of queerson-screen, the failure of Hollywood to address the reality ofthe AIDS crisis on-screen, and the fact that the industry isso homophobic that people can't be out&quot; of the closet, addsJudy Sisneros of Queer Nation, who is helping to organize theOscar demonstration, which she says will likely include &quot;anaction&quot; during the awards show itself.   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, denyingany homophobia on its part, &quot;certainly respects their rightto protest -- so long as they don't come into our venue andcause a disturbance,&quot; a spokesman says.   The rising anger comes despite Hollywood's attempt atfence-mending. A fundraiser for the National Gay and LesbianTask Force, with David Hoberman, president of Walt DisneyCo.'s Touchstone Pictures as host, attracted a Hollywoodpantheon. And soon-to-depart Fox Inc. chief Barry Diller andMCA Inc. president Sidney Sheinberg recently formed HollywoodSupports, an industry group whose aim is to &quot;change the imageof AIDS and break down the barriers presented by prejudiceagainst lesbians and gay men.&quot;   &quot;If you sit down with any studio executive, they will tellyou they have no philosophical objection to positiveportrayals of gays and lesbians,&quot; says entertainment lawyerAlan Hergott, one of the organizers of the gay task forcefund-raiser. None, however, was willing to say so on therecord for this story, and it's clear they are angry aboutthe protests.   &quot;What they would like to do, in certain circumstances, isdo away with the First Amendment,&quot; one top executive says ofthe &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; flap.   While protesters hope to force Hollywood into a newsensitivity, some gay people worry the demonstrations couldcause a backlash, with studios hesitating to approve filmswith any gay characters to avoid future controversies.   For example, even a film with a gay hero -- Warner Bros.'&quot;The Mayor of Castro Street,&quot; about the assassinated SanFrancisco gay-rights champion Harvey Milk -- is drawingcriticism from certain gay groups angry at director OliverStone's involvement in the project because of his &quot;JFK.&quot;They've been threatening to disrupt production when it getsunder way. Frustrated by the criticism, Mr. Stone has backedout of directing the film.   &quot;There's that small, hysterical minority that have wronglycharacterized him as homophobic, and he's not ready to tacklethat controversy,&quot; says a spokeswoman for Mr. Stone, who willcontinue as producer. &quot;The gay activists have done no serviceby keeping Oliver from directing,&quot; adds &quot;Mayor&quot; author RandyShilts, who waited a decade before any studio would touch hisMilk biography.   Studios have been reluctant to produce films with leadinggay characters, in part because of the belief that such filmsare box-office poison. Hollywood's two big flirtations withfilms featuring leading gay characters -- the 1982 releases&quot;Making Love&quot; and &quot;Personal Best&quot; -- were both flops. (Otherfilms with major gay characters that have done well include&quot;Victor/Victoria&quot; and &quot;Midnight Cowboy.&quot;)   Gay people don't buy the bad-box-office argument. &quot;Theyused to say that about black movies. But Spike Lee came alongand put a rest to that old chestnut,&quot; says Mr. Halperin ofOut in Film.   But producers angling to get Hollywood to make moviesdealing sympathetically with homosexuality or AIDS haveconsistently hit brick walls. Executive producer Lindsay Lawcouldn't get any studio to finance his critically acclaimedAIDS film &quot;Longtime Companion.&quot; He eventually got it producedhimself and distributed through the independent SamuelGoldwyn Co. in 1990. &quot;But it's just as difficult to get amovie made with gay characters today as it was two yearsago,&quot; Mr. Law says.   Television producers have fared better at introducing gaycharacters, particularly on sitcoms like &quot;Murphy Brown,&quot;&quot;Designing Women&quot; and &quot;The Golden Girls.&quot; &quot;Melrose Place,&quot; anupcoming spinoff of the hit Fox show &quot;Beverly Hills 90210&quot;will even have a lead character who is gay.   Still, networks are skittish about losing advertisers.Ultraconservative groups like the American Family Associationin Tupelo, Miss., have pressured sponsors to pull out ofprograms with gay themes.   Writer-producer Richard Kramer raised the association'sire with his &quot;thirtysomething&quot; episode that featured two gaycharacters talking in bed. &quot;There was no protest when thesubject was death or disease,&quot; Mr. Kramer says. &quot;But when itwas about love, they protested.&quot;   On the whole, &quot;the films coming out of Hollywood havenothing to do with any gay or lesbian I have ever met,&quot; saysRichard Rouilard, editor in chief of the Advocate, which hasa special &quot;Homophobia in Hollywood&quot; cover story in its nextissue. &quot;The gay community would rather have no gay charactersin any movies if all they're going to get are vampire lesbianserial killers with long toenails.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
