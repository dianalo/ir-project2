Are Targets of Sales Talks </HL><SO> </SO><CO> CSP </CO><IN> TNM PET LNG </IN><DATELINE> STAMFORD, Conn.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Combustion Engineering Inc. said it is negotiating the sale of some of its industrial products operations and all of its remaining oil and gas service operations in three transactions totaling $285 million.    The sales would remove Combustion from the oil and gas equipment business. After the sales are completed, the company would be primarily a provider of engineered systems and services for the process and power industries.    The company had said in late 1985 that it planned to leave the oil and gas industry, for which it provided production equipment. Since then, it has disposed of most of its units in that industry, and the planned sales would complete that divestiture.    The company didn't break down the value of the three sales. It said it agreed to sell its C-E Refractories and Tyler industrial screening businesses, as well as its Natco and Beaumont oil-field equipment operations, to Cummings Point Industries Inc., a Connecticut venture capital firm.    The company said it is negotiating to sell its Jamesbury valve business to a Finnish industrial concern, Rauma-Repola Oy. It said it is in discussions for the sale of its Vetco Services operation, which is based in West Germany, but didn't identify the other party.    &quot;We have continued to change the character of our business so that engineering services and products based on advanced technologies make up a larger share of our revenues,&quot; said Charles E. Hugel, chairman and chief executive officer. The company posted 1987 earnings of $56.6 million, or $1.54 a share, on revenue of $3 billion.    Barry A. Mannis, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., an American Express Co. subsidiary, said the sales are &quot;a continuation of a strategy they have been on for years: refocusing on the power generating market, and focusing for the first time on the process controls and process equipment markets.&quot; He noted that in the past few years, Combustion has made purchases in those areas, &quot;while shedding things outside those two markets.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
