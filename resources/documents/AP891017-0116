Sisulu, released Sunday along with six other senior ANC leaders,said pressure by anti-apartheid groups locally and abroad compelledthe government to free them unconditionally after lengthy prisonterms.   The releases ``were merely a reaction to the pressure of theworld,'' Sisulu told foreign journalists at a church near his homein Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.   Sisulu, 77, is the highest-ranking of the freed activists andand spent 26 years in prison along with his close friend, seniorANC leader Nelson Mandela.   President F.W. de Klerk decided to release the prisoners as partof his effort to improve the climate for negotiating a newconstitution that will include the 28 million black majority.   The government has said the ANC must renounce violence before itcan be allowed to participate in the talks, but Sisulu said hebelieves the ANC should pursue violence to maintain pressure on thegovernment.   ``We don't reject violence,'' said Sisulu. ``It's not because(the ANC) believes in violence for its own sake. It is because ofcompelling conditions. remove the compelling conditions and therewill be peace.''   The ANC's bombing and sabotage campaign, launched in 1961, hasbeen largely dormant this year. There have been more than 210bombings responsible for 37 deaths since the state of emergency wasdeclared in 1986, but only about 40 blasts and three deaths thisyear.   Sisulu denied the ANC had partially suspended its campaign ofviolence, suggesting it was a ``logistical'' decision.   He also called for stronger economic sanctions against SouthAfrica.   ``The pressure must be sustained,'' he said. ``There must be nochance for the government to retreat and reorganize.''   He said the ANC and its backers would not accept anything shortof a one-person, one-vote system.   ``Democracy _ I know it to be only one thing: a vote for all.There is no other democracy,'' said Sisulu. ``We have gotfundamental differences on that'' with the government.   Asked about changes in South Africa since he went to prison,Sisulu said: ``I find the spirit of the people different. I thinkthere is much greater political consciousness, greater awareness,greater unity.''   The Cabinet minister assigned to promote negotiations with blackleaders said Tuesday he was prepared to confer with Sisulu aboutthe ANC's possible role in formal talks.   ``If we want to get going, the fewer preconditions the better,''said Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen.   He said the ANC would have to demonstrate it was committed to apeaceful negotiation process. But he indicated the outlawedguerrilla movement would not necessarily have to make a formalrenunciation of violence, as previously demanded by the government.   Viljoen said the appropriate climate for negotiations ``can onlycome about if, in practice, people distance themselves fromviolence and destablizing activities.''   Sisulu said the ANC would be prepared to enter negotiations ifthe government legalized all banned political organizations, liftedthe state of emergency, released all political prisoners andreprieved all prisoners on Death Row.   De Klerk says he is reviewing these matters to see what steps hemight be able to take, and Viljoen expressed willingness to meetwith Sisulu to discuss the demands.   All but one of the freed prisoners served at least 25 years injail. Five, including Sisulu, were sentenced to life prison termsin 1964, along with Mandela, for plotting anti-government sabotage.   Mandela, 71, remains imprisoned, although he is expected to bereleased soon.</TEXT></DOC>
