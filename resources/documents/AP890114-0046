The spokesman, Ruy Nogueira, said the American commission madeits proposals Friday to Brazilian President Jose Sarney during aprivate session at his official residence in Brasilia.   The team, composed of Sens. Timothy Wirth, Richard Shelby, JohnHeinz and Reps. Gerry Sikorsky and John Bryant, is in Brazil on afact-finding mission that will include visits to the western statesof Amazonas, Rondonia and Acre.   The proposals show an increased willingness on the part ofcreditor nations to link new credit proposals with environmentalprotection packages.   Nogueira said the American delegation made no officialdeclarations, but sketched several proposals in which Brazil woulduse portions of its foreign debt payments to create environmentalpreservation projects in the western Amazon.   Brazil is the Third World's leading debtor nation, with a foreigndebt of $115 billion.   But in a meeting Friday at the foreign ministry, one governmentrepresentative told reporters it was ``unreasonable to insist thatBrazil pull back its development programs in the name of protectingthe environment.   ``A developing country that has to create 1.7 million new jobsper year and service debt cannot forgo the occupation of itsterritory,'' said the sub-secretary of foreign relations, PauloTarso Flecha de Lima.   He said Brazil is studying how best to commercially develop theAmazon without causing widespread ecological damage.   But without debt relief from industrialized countries, occupyingthe Amazon in a ``rational manner'' would be difficult.   ``The international community must assist us with debt relief,technical assistance and financial support,'' said Flecha de Lima.   The issue of how to develop the Amazon jungle, an expanse oftropical forest about two-thirds the size of continental UnitedStates, has taken on international significance.   Satellite inspection shows cattle ranchers and miners each yearchop or burn down an area the size of Belgium from the jungle, whichextends across 60 percent of Brazil's territory and contains 30percent of the world's rainforest.   Conservationists are worried about the ``greenhouse effect'' onglobal climate from uncontrolled burning in the Amazon basin.   The removal of oxygen-producing trees and release of noxiousgases into the atmosphere, some experts say, raises the earth'stemperature and could have been a factor in the summer 1988 droughtin the Midwest.</TEXT></DOC>
