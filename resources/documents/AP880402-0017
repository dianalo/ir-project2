With Dukakis and Jackson neck-and-neck in the delegate countthus far _ Dukakis with 653.55 to Jackson's 643.55 _ another 81delegates are at stake in Tuesday's primary in Wisconsin.   Both candidates also planned weekend forays into Colorado, whichholds caucuses Monday that begin the selection process for 45 ofthe state's 51 Democratic delegates and its 36 GOP delegates to thenational conventions.   The Massachusetts governor on Friday stepped up his quest forblue-collar votes in Wisconsin by sounding the themes of economicpopulism that had been articulated by Gephardt until the Missouricongressman exited the race last month.   ``The human cost of seven years of Republican indifference isstaggering,'' Dukakis said in a television ad that started airingFriday. ``Who in this administration could look right into the eyesof the laid-off factory worker or the homeless family and saythey've kept the promise of America? I say they've broken thatpromise.''   The new emphasis was evident in his speeches as well.   ``Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams aren't the modelfor a new America,'' Dukakis told a crowd of about 500 peoplecrowded into the Racine Labor Center.   Gephardt, interviewed on the syndicated show ``One on One,''said he didn't mind seeing his ideas circulate among those left inthe race he'd once hoped to finish first.   ``Everybody has stolen it,'' he said. ``I willed it to everybodywhen I pulled out and I hope they will use it. It is the issue ofthis campaign.''   Jackson, who sounds the populist message as well, on Fridaycalled for higher prices for farm products and said consumerseasily could pick up the tab.   ``The fact is farmers deserve fair prices and workers deservefair wages and the rich must pay fair taxes,'' Jackson told agathering at the farm of Bud and Faye Lee in Amery, Wis. ``Thereality is if urban people are working, they can pay a few morepennies for a glass of milk or for a cone of ice cream or for aloaf of bread.''   Jackson, speaking later Friday in La Crosse, invited disgruntledRepublicans to vote for him in Tuesday's primary.   For people who made the ``colossal error'' of voting forPresident Reagan and now ``realize your mistake, you can correctyour error,'' he said. Wisconsin law allows voters to select acandidate from any party regardless of their political affiliation.   Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr., lagging behind in the Democraticrace, continued to be the main voice of criticism against Jackson,whose popularity has surged in recent contests.   ``An end to bigotry does not mean some candidates are game forcriticism and some are immune,'' Gore said.   Bringing up the rear was Paul Simon, who aimed his fire at Gore.   Simon, visiting about 100 supporters at an airport rally in EauClaire, accused Gore of making bold promises to farmers and added:``If you're looking for a candidate with all kinds of easypromises, I'm not your candidate. I voted against the 1985 farmprogram that caused a drop in milk prices. We have to do better andI won't make promises, unlike some people.''   Gore favors government price supports for dairy farms and isproposing a two-tier support formula that he said would help familyfarms compete against corporate farms.   On the Republican side, 47 delegates were at stake in Wisconsin,with Vice President George Bush the commanding leader over tokencompetitor Pat Robertson.   Robertson was spending the weekend in Colorado, which holdscaucuses Monday, trying to drum up some support Western-style. Hisschedule included talks to an estimated 5,000 people in Denver-areacongregations on Easter Sunday.   Robertson has conceded he has virtually no chance of being theGOP nominee, but wants to help influence the GOP platform at theconvention.   ``He wants to represent conservatives and Christians in theformation of the platform so that we can have a voice,'' said aideDavid Nelson.</TEXT></DOC>
