The inclusion of two U.S. concerns raisedU.S. hopes for greater access to Japan's multibillion-dollartelecommunications market.   NTT, after reviewing proposals from domestic and foreignfirms, invited American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s ATandamp;TInternational Inc. unit and Motorola Inc., along with TelefonAB L.M. Ericsson of Sweden, to join seven Japanese concernsin developing base-station equipment and telephone sets forthe system.</LP><TEXT>   There was concern that NTT wasn't living up to aprocurement accord with the U.S., dating back to 1981.However, NTT's announcement prompted U.S. officials to praisethe company for trying harder to abide by its commitment toorder equipment in a &quot;nondiscriminatory&quot; manner.   &quot;This is another signal that Japan is providing adequateopportunities for foreign companies to participate in thissector,&quot; said Juan Benitez, deputy assistant secretary ofcommerce for science and electronics. &quot;At the very least, I'dwelcome it.&quot;   In Tokyo, an NTT spokesman denied that the contractrepresented any change in the company's procurement policy.NTT has been seeking foreign suppliers since the Japanesetelecommunications market was deregulated in 1985, he said.&quot;The policy is fair and open procurement,&quot; the spokesmanadded. &quot;We will procure from domestic and overseas companiesif they have good products and cheap products.&quot;   NTT plans to finish the development phase of its digitalsystem by 1992, but the spokesman said the company doesn'tknow when it will begin procurement. The spokesman said it ispossible that the foreign companies that received thedevelopment contracts will receive procurement contracts aswell.   The U.S. isn't likely to have more than a modest share ofthe project, whose value hasn't been disclosed. However,Allen Frischkorn, president of the WashingtonbasedTelecommunications Industry Association, predicted theproject could earn U.S. concerns substantial collateralbusiness as they gain experience in the hardto-crack Japanesemarket.   Some U.S. officials, however, said they want to seefurther indications of a widening Japanese market. &quot;This issomething that the Commerce Department will be looking atvery carefully as the process continues,&quot; said MichaelFarren, undersecretary of commerce for international trade.   In December, the NTT procurement accord was renewed forthree years despite some complaints that it wasn'tstimulating enough purchases of U.S. equipment. NTT ordered$350 million in U.S. equipment in the Japanese fiscal yearthat ended in March, but this amount was equivalent to only4% of NTT's total procurement of $8.75 billion. Mr.Frischkorn said he hopes U.S. vendors eventually will attain20% of NTT's procurement business.   Japan's mobile phone market is still relativelyundeveloped, with penetration only about one-fourth that ofthe U.S. and Britain, according to some studies. Analysts saythat opening up the market to more competitors, in additionto moving to the more advanced digital technology, may helpcut prices and spread use.   Traditionally, NTT has rarely publicly discloseddevelopment projects, instead quietly farming them out toJapanese companies. But, under U.S. pressure, NTT in recentyears has been trying to demonstrate publicly it is openingup its procurement process to foreign companies.   The Bush administration also is encouraged by NTT'sapparent willingness to give U.S. concerns a role insupplying future-generation equipment. &quot;This aspect is assignificant as the money involved,&quot; said another U.S. tradeofficial.   Tom L. Powers, president of ATandamp;T's Network Systems'Cellular Systems unit, said that while the &quot;initial contractawards will be small, {about} $10 million over the next fewyears,&quot; getting a piece of the NTT project is still animportant win. &quot;This is the way you solve trade problems,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Not by big contracts but an accretion of hundreds andhundreds of smaller deals such as this.&quot;   The ATandamp;T unit has been chosen to supply radiotransmitters, receivers and amplifiers, which are used topass calls from one phone to another in a cellular network.   The agreement on cellular equipment is not ATandamp;T's first inJapan. In the past few years the company's Network SystemsGroup has received orders from NTT totaling $350 million forcomputerized network management systems and fiber-optictransmission gear. It is also one of several owners of JapanEnhanced Network Services, a data network service.   A Washington-based Motorola spokeswoman said the company'spart in the project could involve supplying NTT with itsnewest voice-coding and decoding technology. U.S. vendorspreviously complained that NTT reserved such high-valueorders for its domestic suppliers.   ATandamp;T and Motorola already are among NTT's leading U.S.suppliers, along with International Business Machines Corp.and Digital Equipment Corp. However, Ericsson's participationrepresents an even bigger symbolic win for Europeansuppliers. The company said its share of NTT's order was thebiggest so far for a European telecommunications concern inJapan. It didn't provide further details about the contract.   Lars Ramqvist, Ericsson chief executive officer, said theorder &quot;is of utmost strategic value since Japan was the onlylarge important market in the world where Ericsson isn'tpresent with mobile phone systems.&quot;   Ericsson had been one of the leading suppliers of analogcellular systems and claims a 40% global share of suchcellular systems installed to date. Some analysts hadexpected that share to dwindle amid tougher competition fornew-generation digital cellular systems.   The U.S. trade official said NTT's increasing purchases ofU.S. equipment are a direct result of trade negotiations.&quot;This didn't happen by itself,&quot; he said.   In addition to nondiscrimination, the NTT procurementaccord commits the corporate giant to conduct its contractawards in a &quot;transparent&quot; manner.   ---   Jacob M.
