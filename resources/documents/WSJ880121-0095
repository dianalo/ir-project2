Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> SCR STK NDX </IN><G> SEC </G><DATELINE> SAN DIEGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fundamental changes in the nature of institutional trading are a major focus of the Securities and Exchange Commission's pending report on the October stock market crash, according to the SEC official heading the study.    In a speech here that previewed the SEC study to be released next month, Richard Ketchum, the director of the SEC's division of market regulation, said that institutional investors increasingly are trading &quot;baskets,&quot; or portfolios, of stock, rather than individual stocks.    Just as the stock market's orientation has shifted from the individual investor to the institutional investor, he said, so, in the next step, has trading by those institutions moved from an orientation to individual stocks to a concern with the market as a whole.    &quot;This is a major change in the way they look at the market,&quot; Mr. Ketchum said. For an investor who trades most of the stocks in the Standard andamp; Poor's 500 at once, he said, news external to the market, such as &quot;interest rates, the price of the dollar, becomes more important, and individual corporate news becomes relatively less important.&quot;    Mr. Ketchum declined to discuss the implications of that change, saying, &quot;Wait a couple of weeks,&quot; until the SEC's analysis of the crash is released. But other market commentators who recently have noted this phenomenon have argued that as investors have become less sensitive to company news, they have made the stock market far more sensitive -- and vulnerable -- to governmental actions, such as moves by the Federal Reserve Board.    Mr. Ketchum also indicated that the SEC's analysis of the market crash essentially agrees with that done by the Brady task force. He said the Brady study, which was released earlier this month, should be read by &quot;anybody interested in where regulation of the markets is going to go.&quot;    Like the authors of the Brady report, Mr. Ketchum dwelled on the relationship between the stock and futures markets. In his speech, which was delivered to the Securities Regulation Institute at the University of California at San Diego, he noted that the introduction of stock-index futures a few years ago &quot;provided enormous liquidity, at least in normal circumstances.&quot;    The new liquidity, he continued, acted like portfolio insurance in encouraging institutional investors to increase their equity positions and remain in them &quot;as long as they absolutely can.&quot; Portfolio insurance is a computerized hedging strategy that involves trading in both the stock and futures markets.    When the SEC approved the introduction of index futures, he said, it did so in the belief that the new products would be useful hedging tools for institutions. But it now appears, he said, that &quot;the prime thing those products provided . . . is market-timing capabilities&quot; -- that is, the ability to move in and out of the stock market quickly.    In an interview later about another intermarket matter, Mr. Ketchum said that cross-market front-running, or trading in one market on knowledge of imminent events in another market, is &quot;going to have to be looked at very closely.&quot; He declined to say whether the SEC's study of the stock market crash would address that subject, but others at the agency have said it will. </TEXT></DOC>
