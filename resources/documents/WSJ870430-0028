Rudolph W. Giuliani, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan, said he believes this is the first time that a court has issued an injunction against an entire organized crime family.    The injunction, entered by U.S. district Judge Vincent L. Broderick, concludes the government's 1986 civil case that earlier led to the placing of New York City's two primary concrete-workers unions into receivership.    Mr. Giuliani said the injunction means that any time a member or associate of the &quot;commission&quot; -- the Mafia's so-called board of directors -- or the Colombo family has any contact with a union or concrete construction project, he will be subject to contempt citations, including fines and prison terms.    The prosecutor said the court order will help stem organized crime's influence in the New York City construction industry, although the injunction technically applies nationwide.    An attorney who handles Colombo family matters couldn't be reached for comment yesterday. John Jacobs, an attorney for convicted commission member Anthony Salerno, said the injunction is &quot;academic&quot; in relation to his client, because Mr. Salerno is serving a 100-year prison term. </TEXT></DOC>
