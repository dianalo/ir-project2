The document filed with the Securities and Exchange Commissioncontained the clearest public statement of the family's intentionsto date.   Some analysts have speculated the $64-per-share offer from familymembers was intended to put the company on the auction block. Otherssaid the family appeared to be serious about retaining control andmay have made the offer as a defensive move to ward off othertakeover attempts.   The acquisition was undertaken ``in order to better enable thefamily and the company's management to focus attention on thelong-term interests of the company,'' the SEC filing said.   The family proposed the leveraged buyout to the Coleman board onFeb. 14.
