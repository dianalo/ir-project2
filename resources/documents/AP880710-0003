The official Voice of Nicaragua said 10 police officers wereinjured in the hourlong protest but did not give any figures forcivilian casualties in this small city about 40 miles south ofManagua, the capital. It said 38 protesters were detained.   President Daniel Ortega told reporters later the governmentwould act ``with total firmness'' against protesters. He saidSunday's demonstration was part of a U.S. plan to destabilize thegovernment.   ``We cannot continue being tolerant with those who want to takeadvantage of the (political) space,'' Ortega said, referring torecent freedoms accorded to anti-government groups in Nicaragua.   Ortega made his comments after visiting the family of aSandinista youth organization member who authorities said waskilled Saturday when the car he was riding in was ambushed byU.S.-backed rebels.   The violence erupted after an estimated 10,000 protestersmarched several blocks along the city's mud-covered streets.   The marchers, some carying signs saying: ``Democracy Yes,Communism No,'' then gathered in an open field for speeches.Witnesses said police began pushing and shoving at the back of thecrowd.   People suddenly started screaming and running for cover aspolice, wearing gas masks and carrying AK-47 rifles, lobbed teargas canisters into the crowd. Groups of protesters grabbed stonesand sticks and started hurling them at police. ``You murderousdogs!'' one man yelled.   Police beat several people with their fists, feet and riflebutts. One man stood stunned, blood dripping down his face, hisarms cut.   Witnesses said police threw one of the rally organizers, CarlosHuembes, to the ground, then punched and kicked him.   Plainclothes security agents confiscated film from severalphotographers, including one from The Associated Press.   Scores of heavily armed police in four-wheel drive vehicles andpickup trucks had stood guard before the violence erupted.   ``We're here to make sure that order is kept,'' an officer said.   A state security officer told the AP later that police had usedtear gas in response to stone-throwing by the protesters.   The demonstration, one of the largest yet against the leftistgovernment, was organized by the Democratic Coordinate, an umbrellagroup for anti-government political parties and trade organizations.   It was authorized by the government, which staged its ownpro-Sandinista demonstration in the town over the weekend.   ``This is to show the people want democracy,'' said protesterMyriam Arguello, secretary-general of the anti-governmentConservative Party, only minutes before the violence erupted.   Roger Guevara, secretary of the Coordinate, said in a statementthat Huembes and two other members of the organization were amongthose detained Sunday night. The statement identified the two asAgustin Jarquin Anaya and Adan Fletes of the Social Christian party.   Public discontent with the Sandinistas has increased this yearas Nicaragua's economy worsens and the government's war againstU.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, remains unsettled.   The government claims the Reagan administration has beenattempting to stir up discontent in Nicaragua.   The Sandinista newspaper Barricada ran a headline Sunday with awarning to the U.S. Embassy: ``Don't Provoke The Ire of thePeople.''   The Sandinista government was established in July 1979 after acivil war toppled the rightist government of Anastasio Somoza.</TEXT></DOC>
