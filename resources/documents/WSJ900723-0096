Lockheed already has taken one writedown of that size toreflect miscalculations it made on the development of theplane. Had it gone ahead with production under the Navy'sterms, it would have encountered another deficit &quot;comparableto or more than&quot; the earlier charge, Lockheed Chairman DanielTellep said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We didn't ask for a bailout on development, but weweren't going to take losses on production,&quot; Mr. Tellep saidin an interview. &quot;I had to be firm on that.&quot;   The Navy's action, which scuttles the $600 milliondevelopment pact and deprives Lockheed of a major projectthat ultimately could have been valued at as much as $5billion for 123 aircraft, is one of the harshest of its kindever initiated against a contractor. It overshadows, forexample, the 1985 cancellation of the $4 billion SergeantYork tank-gun program with Ford Motor Co.'s aerospace unit.   Under a termination for default, the government compels acontractor to pay for all expenses associated with ending aprogram. But Mr. Tellep guaranteed that the $300 millionreserve taken earlier would cover all such obligations on theP-7. &quot;If the default is sustained, we will have no morewrite-offs,&quot; he said.   The Navy also can opt to bring in another company to buildthe plane and then make Lockheed pay for any additional coststhat arise from the switch. But Mr. Tellep said: &quot;We've beengiven assurances from very high-level people in the Navy thatthey do not intend to reprocure the airplane from anybodyelse. There are both practical and legal arguments why theycan't do it.&quot;   Meanwhile, Lockheed is appealing the Navy's decision, inan effort to force the government to pay for the termination.If the appeals process, which can take years to resolve, issuccessful, Mr. Tellep said, Lockheed expects to recover&quot;well over half&quot; of the earlier write-down.   In accusing Lockheed of defaulting on the P-7 deal, theNavy said the company &quot;failed to make adequate progresstoward the completion&quot; of two prototypes that fulfillcontract-performance specifications.   But Mr. Tellep insisted that the plane Lockheed hasdesigned &quot;meets all requirements and is reasonably priced,&quot;adding that &quot;we had a great airplane.&quot;   Nonetheless, cancellation of the P-7 program leavesLockheed, once one of America's most illustrious planemakers, with only one active aircraft line -- for the oldC-130 transport. Moreover, it throws into doubt whether thenation's sixth-largest Pentagon supplier can ever really turnaround its ailing Marietta, Ga., factory, which had beencounting on the P-7 eventually to restore about 2,000 jobs.Lockheed also leads a team that is bidding to make the AirForce's next-generation fighter-jet, but this is a highlyuncertain proposition.   In a larger sense, the default notice also raises seriousquestions about other Pentagon contracts that are in dispute.Under these so-called fixed-price arrangements, a company isoften forced to lock into a pricing schedule before it issure about the cost to develop and produce a new technology.Though the government has vowed not to use such grievousagreements anymore, billions of dollars have been written offacross the industry because of them.   And some analysts interpreted the Navy's intransigence onthe P-7 to be a sign that the government was going to playhardball with those companies that are trying to renegotiatetheir fixed-price accords. Just last week, McDonnell DouglasCorp. and General Dynamics Corp. said they would file claimsagainst the Navy on the A-12 attack plane program.   But other observers cautioned that each project must beassessed on an individual basis. In the case of the P-7,Defense Department officials said that Navy brass -- alreadybattling to stave off deep cuts in larger, higher-priorityprograms -- simply became convinced they couldn't getlawmakers to support an overall increase in the cost of theplane.   Still, the cancellation came as something of a surprise.In an interview with this newspaper in May, Mr. Tellepindicated that he was &quot;encouraged&quot; that the P-7 issue wouldbe resolved favorably.   But in the end, the chairman said, price became the hurdlethat the two sides just couldn't get over. He explained thatLockheed and the Navy agreed on pricing for the first threeproduction lots, covering a total of seven aircraft. Yet theycouldn't make headway on the last five lots.   Mr. Tellep said he believes that Lockheed, by making the$300 million adjustment on development, had owned up to itsshare of problems on the P-7. But the Navy &quot;also bearsresponsibility,&quot; he said, for delays on the project. Forexample, he said that 18 months into the program, the Navystill hadn't specified its requirements on &quot;design loads.&quot;   &quot;It was their inability to provide data in a timely way,&quot;Mr. Tellep said. &quot;We were in conflict on that.&quot;   Navy officials reportedly urged saving the P-7 by agreeingto buy a maximum of 100 from the planned fleet, thus holdingdown the overall program cost. But Mr. Tellep disputed this,saying that the service never put such a plan on the table.   The development error essentially was the result ofLockheed's believing the P-7 would have a lot in common withits predecessor, the P-3; in fact, to meet the Navy's wishesfor an aircraft that could travel 1,600 miles from home andlinger over waters for as long as four hours, an entirely newdesign was called for.   Mr. Tellep maintained, however, that the Navy was askingto have it both ways -- a plane that was based on a previousmodel, which theoretically would hold down the cost, as wellas difficult-to-meet specifications and design guidelines.&quot;This was inherently contradictory and not discoverable untilyou did a year's worth of design work,&quot; Mr. Tellep said.   &quot;This was not a technical failure or a design failure,&quot; heinsisted. &quot;This just underscores the failure of fixed-pricetotal package procurement. This is one, I'm afraid, whereeverybody loses.&quot;   ---   Andy Pasztor in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
