WILEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An official of a Montana-based church wassentenced Friday to a month in prison and three months homedetention for his role in a scheme to buy paramilitary weaponsillegally.   U.S. District Judge Justin Quackenbush told Edward L. Francis,39, that his crime merited prison time because of his position as aleader of the Church Universal and Triumphant of Corwin Springs,Mont.   The sect's theology draws from tenets of Christian, Easternmystic and New Age religions, as well as conservative politicalphilosophy. Church leaders continually denied rumors that weaponswere being stockpiled for the aftermath of a predicted nuclear war.   Francis is the church's business manager and husband of churchleader Elizabeth Clare Prophet, who did not accompany her husbandto the federal court hearing.   Francis pleaded guilty in October to one count of conspiracy tomake a false statement in acquisition of a firearm. He was accusedof giving nearly $150,000 in cash and gold to another churchmember, Vernon Hamilton, who used fake names to purchaselarge-caliber semiautomatic weapons and ammunition.   The church's governing board said it had not authorized anychurch money for the guns. The money involved was Francis' own froman inheritance.   The weapons _ .50-caliber assault rifles, armor-piercingammunition and sniper rifles _ could have been purchased legallywith proper identification.   In addition to the prison term, Quackenbush imposed a strictthree-month home detention sentence under which Francis's movementswill be monitored electronically. He will be allowed to leave hishome only for church services and certain appointments.   Francis also was fined $5,000 and placed on two years ofsupervised release, meaning he would be returned to prison to servethe entire two years should he violate terms of his release.   ``I am extremely sorry for the acts I took and the involvement Ihad in this,'' Francis told the judge prior to sentencing. ``Theresimply is no excuse.''   Hamilton, the church's reputed security chief, was given threeyears probation and fined $1,000 on Dec. 1 after pleading guilty toa conspiracy count.</TEXT></DOC>
