In a letter dated Wednesday to Defense Secretary DickCheney, Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), chairman of the Housesubcommittee on oversight and investigations, criticized anyplans to buy more of the helicopters: &quot;I cannot, for the lifeof me, fathom the logic of such a decision.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Dingell wrote that although the Army isn't equipped toprovide adequate maintenance support for the nearly 600Apaches it has on hand, contracts for more AH-64s could besigned within the next few days. The helicopters cost $14million each, though Mr. Dingell said the firm has asked fora large increase in price and profit in the contract talks.   A spokesman for McDonnell Douglas's helicopter unitdeclined to comment. An Army spokeswoman also said shecouldn't comment on any correspondence to Mr. Cheney. But shedid confirm that the service recently wrapped up talks withMcDonnell Douglas for 66 AH-64s. The Pentagon wants, andCongress has approved funding for, 132 additional Apaches,which would mean a fleet of 807 by mid-1993.   Mr. Dingell reiterated a call for the talks with St.Louis-based McDonnell Douglas to be terminated. Despite theArmy's pledge to add extra manpower and testing to each AH-64battalion, he said, it &quot;does not have the money&quot; to do so.   The General Accounting Office, commissioned by Mr. Dingellto research the Apache problems, has recommended that theArmy not contract for the final 132. He said in his letterthat the GAO's stance &quot;makes even more sense&quot; given that theWarsaw Pact is &quot;in total disarray.&quot;   Although Army Secretary Michael Stone has maintained thatsubstantial progess has been made in fixing the AH-64, thesubcommittee continues to cite field reports that the Apachefails under fire. During the U.S. invasion of Panama inDecember, for example, the Apache's electronic components hadto be dried in kitchen ovens after it rained, according toevidence presented in an April panel hearing.   After the first day of fighting in Panama, four of the sixAH-64s sent there were grounded when three were shot up withrifle fire. Meanwhile, the fuel cell in one Apache fizzledout prior to the attack, and by the time a replacementarrived, the AH-64 for which it was intended had beencannibalized for spare parts.</TEXT></DOC>
