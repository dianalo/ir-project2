Theprograms calculate standard deviations or confidence intervals of fittedsurvival calculate parameters, OER, and RBE. The programs calculate survivalcurves for linear quadratic, repair saturation, single-hit multitarget,linear multitarget, and repair-misrepair models. Multiple plating efficienciesare calculated as least squares fitting parameters for data that is acombination of multiple datasets. The programs perform either non-robustleast squares fitting or robust fitting with Tukey's bisquare weight.A priori weights can be included, and the programs have been used tostudy new approaches to weighting data points. Several examples of invitro cell survival data illustrate the use of the programs. The programsrun on a VAX computer and can be used with a variety of graphics terminals.</TEXT></DOC>
