The United Nations-sponsored pact calls for the developedworld to ban chlorofluorocarbons and many otherozone-destroying chemicals by the year 2000. The developingworld has an extra decade to comply. The accord, expected tocost the U.S. economy about $4.5 billion, is aimed at haltingchemically caused damage to the atmosphere's natural layer ofozone gas, which helps block the Sun's harmful ultravioletrays.</LP><TEXT>   But the London agreement won't be the last word on thesubject. Even as the 10-day meeting ended Friday, officialsfrom West Germany, Australia, Scandinavia and other&quot;green&quot;-minded nations were pushing for tougher measures --including a ban by 1997, instead of 2000. Andenvironmentalists and some leading ozone scientistsimmediately denounced the accord as inadequate to protect theozone layer.   &quot;Within five years' time, they {world governments} willrealize they have to go a lot faster&quot; to end use of CFCs,said Joseph C. Farman, a British scientist whose discovery ofan &quot;ozone hole&quot; over Antarctica in 1985 touched off theglobal alarm over CFCs. The accord, Mr. Farman said, willstill allow a 33% rise over the next decade in theatmospheric concentration of ozone-destroying chlorinecompounds -- with unpredictable results for human health.   The prospect of tougher curbs worries manychemical-industry officials, who say even the 2000 deadlinewill be difficult to meet. &quot;It's crystal ball-gazing,&quot; saidMichael Harris, a lobbyist for Britain's Imperial ChemicalIndustries PLC. The accord &quot;is an act of faith that somehowor other our industry will find the answers to meet thattimetable.&quot;   The world's $2 billion-a-year production of CFCs andrelated chemicals are used in refrigerators, airconditioners, foam insulation, spray cans and industrialsolvent compounds. Many of these uses can be avoided; forinstance, nations can easily replace CFCs with hydrocarbongases as spray-can propellants, as U.S. industry did by lawin 1978.   But industry officials say that at least 40% of today'sCFC uses will depend for substitutes on specialozone-friendly chemicals that the industry is only nowdeveloping, many of which won't be ready until the middle ofthe decade.   Most of the measures adopted in London -- which must stillbe ratified by each nation's legislature -- are already inU.S. House and Senate drafts of the Clean Air Act inCongress.</TEXT></DOC>
