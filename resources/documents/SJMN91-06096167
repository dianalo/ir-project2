Doonesbury creator GarryTrudeau has been allowed a peek. And Monday he will begin a series of stripsassociated with what he has seen there -- to appear in his 700 newspapersworldwide.;    &quot;Nancy Reagan: an Unauthorized Biography&quot; is the fourth inKelley's ongoing dissection of the high and mighty (Jacqueline Onassis,Elizabeth Taylor, Frank Sinatra) and is still the best-guarded secret inpublishing. It has been kept most thoroughly under wraps by Simon andamp; Schuster.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  TRUDEAU DRAWS ATTENTION TO 'NANCY'  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  The Grapevine  </MEMO><TEXT>     Trudeau sent his strips out last week and has been holding his breath eversince, hoping people in his syndicate will honor &quot;the embargo&quot; stamped onsame, and not tip his hand. Naturally, these comic strips will becontroversial and probably give some editors a few headaches. It won't be thefirst time. Trudeau has had his work dropped from time to time because editorsconsidered his satiric attacks &quot;too much.&quot; He himself has never backed offfrom examining the Frank Sinatras and Donald Trumps of the world.;   BEAUTIFUL DEFENSE: Actress Andie MacDowell comes to the defense of her &quot;GreenCard&quot; co-star Gerard Depardieu -- the center of criticism and controversybecause of statements he's allegedly made about having committed rape &quot;toomany times to count&quot; during his youth.;    &quot;How do you pass judgment on achild?&quot; she says. As far as Depardieu's quotes in the 1978 &quot;Film Comment&quot;magazine that &quot;the girls wanted to be raped . . . there's really no such thingas rape . . .&quot; MacDowell believes it was &quot;probably a total misunderstanding.Gerard loves women so much and he was always so kind and so sweet to me, Iwould be very surprised if he really said those things.&quot;;    MacDowell, who'sbeen in demand since 1989's &quot;Sex, Lies and Videotape,&quot; had hoped &quot;Green Card&quot;would be the vehicle to put her over the top. But the backlash againstDepardieu on these shores isn't helping the movie's fortunes.;    Still, sheneedn't worry. She's starring opposite John Malkovich in the comedy &quot;Object ofBeauty&quot; due out this month. And she's Bruce Willis' leading lady in theupcoming big-screen &quot;Hudson Hawk.&quot; The former supermodel also just startedshooting the &quot;A Domestic Dilemma&quot; segment of HBO's &quot;Women andamp; Men&quot; trilogy withRay Liotta and already has her next feature film assignment lined up. Shestarts shooting &quot;Ruby Cairo&quot; for director Graeme Clifford this fall.; FromMarilyn Beck and Stacy Jenel Smith in Hollywood;    BIG-SCREEN SCENE: Thereal-life saga of Palm Beach socialite Mollie Wilmont and the Venezuelanfreighter that crashed into her oceanfront property appears to be on its wayto the big screen -- as a break-into-dance style Disney musical, with &quot;Evita&quot;and &quot;Jesus Christ Superstar&quot; co-creator Tim Rice likely aboard.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  From Liz Smith in New York  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910405  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  494  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday April 5, 199100096167,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
