About 200 people took part in the demonstration, during whichnine protesters lay down at the building's entrance and werecovered with sheets splattered with red paint.   ``I cannot not be here. It's an action that says no moremilitary wars, no more recognition of the illegal government of ElSalvador which kills its people,'' Sheen said.   On Tuesday, demonstrators blockaded government buildings in SanFrancisco and Washington state. A policeman was knocked unconsciousand bloodied with a two-by-four in Minneapolis, and some activistscalled for a boycott of Salvadoran coffee.   Tuesday's demonstrations brought more than 200 arrests.   The protests coincided with heavy fighting in San Salvador,including the takeover by leftist rebels of a luxury hotel. Thetakeover trapped U.S. soldiers.   The demonstrators' anger focused on last week's killings of sixJesuit priests, slayings the protesters blame on rightists alliedwith the Salvadoran military.   U.S. citizens ``do not want their dollars spent on torture andmurder,'' said San Francisco Mayor Art Agnos in a statementcoinciding with one protest. ``We aren't in the business of buyingbullets to murder priests or anyone else.''   President Bush on Monday reaffirmed U.S. support for SalvadoranPresident Alfredo Cristiani's rightist government. The UnitedStates has provided about $3.5 billion to oppose the insurgency, inwhich more than 71,000 people, mostly civilians, have died.Fifty-five U.S. military advisers are assigned to El Salvador.   ``I believe that the United States has parallels to Germany inthe 30's right now and that our money is funding atrocities,'' saidEliza Reid protester in Olympia, Wash.   In Minneapolis, Officer Lyle Beauchamp was hit in the face witha board and knocked unconscious. He required stitches. The boardcame out of a crowd while police were arresting protesters forspray-painting buildings, authorities said.   Seventeen demonstrators were arrested.   An estimated 400 people blocked entrances to the San FranciscoFederal Building, and 141 were arrested in the three-hour protest.Some of the demonstrators later briefly blocked traffic in front ofthe Salvadoran consulate.   Some of the building's 6,000 workers, as well as people headedfor court, struggled through the protesters to get into the20-story building.   Most of those arrested were cited for disturbing the peace. Asimilar protest Monday ended with 136 arrests.   In Olympia, about 200 protesters briefly blocked a street and 29people were arrested for blocking the entrance to the FederalBuilding. They were cited for trespassing.   In Bellingham, Wash., near Seattle, about 150 protesterscarrying a huge banner moved from the Federal Building into anintersection where police cars, motorcycles and a logging truckblocked their way.   Twenty-three people were arrested for disorderly conduct afterthey sat down in the street.   A group represented by actor Ed Asner was one of several callingfor a boycott of coffee from El Salvador, a $200 million-a-yearcash crop that represents 21 percent of that country's grossnational product and 5 percent of U.S. coffee imports.</TEXT></DOC>
