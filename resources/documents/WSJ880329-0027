The former Marcus Schloss andamp; Co. analyst admitted the allegations in a complaint filed against him here yesterday by the Securities and Exchange Commission. He also agreed to settle a planned SEC administrative proceeding that will suspend him for a year from association with any broker, dealer, investment company, investment adviser or municipal securities dealer.    Mr. Solomon is one of the so-called Yuppie Five -- four young Wall Street professionals and a client -- who pleaded guilty in 1986 to trading on inside information about corporate takeovers. The information was stolen from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison, a prominent New York law firm that was retained by several corporate takeover targets, by Michael David, a former associate at the firm and the central figure in the case.    The SEC's complaint filed yesterday alleged that Mr. Solomon, while employed at Marcus Schloss, received inside information from Mr. David about proposed or anticipated takeovers, which he then conveyed to his employer or others who traded in the securities of the target companies or led others to trade.    The SEC alleged that Mr. Solomon got information about GAF Corp.'s tender offer for Union Carbide Corp., announced Dec. 9, 1985; Dominion Textile's tender offer for Avondale Mills, announced Feb. 27, 1986; B.A.T Industries PLC's proposal for a takeover of American Brands Inc. and an investor group's consideration of a leveraged buyout of Revco D.S. Inc., announced March 11, 1986.    Three of those takeover situations also were the subject of a complaint filed against Mr. Solomon's former employer, Marcus Schloss. The firm settled the charges in February. Ronald Yagoda, a former top arbitrager at Marcus Schloss who was named in a separate complaint by the SEC at the time, is fighting the charges.    A lawyer for the SEC declined to say why it took the agency almost two years after Mr. Solomon's guilty plea to resolve the civil case, but indicated that when a defendant cooperates with the SEC, charges often are held off until related suits are filed. Mr. Solomon's settlement with the SEC included a cooperation agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
