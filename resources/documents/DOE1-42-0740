The EPIC system was designedto perform two distinct functions: to serve as an advanced replacementfor the existing plant process computer and to assist in providing theJAFNPP operations staff with information during plant emergency conditions.Besides meeting the operational and regulatory goals of NYPA, EPIC wasdesigned to meet NYPA human factors criteria. Using human factors literature,industry standards and guidelines, a Human Factors Criteria documentwas prepared for the EPIC project. This document served as the basesfor all hardware, display, and documentation design applicable to EPIC.The major tasks of the EPIC human factors plan include integration ofpast and present applicable human factors information, establishmentof a user definition using data gathered from control room observations(startup and shutdown of JAFNPP), survey of computer programs used bythe operators, and obtaining input from licensed operators. These majortasks played a role in the design of the design of the control room configuration,the design and development of computer generated displays, and the formatin which the displayed and hard copy information would be presented tothe user. This paper presents an overview of the human factors work performedand the documents researched or developed in the design of EPIC displays,software, and hardware. The location and operation of this new computerbased information system, like the displays was based on the systematicapplication of operations and human factors principles.</TEXT></DOC>
