But now the options are stirring up a lot ofcriticism, too.   One reason, ironically, is that many option packages areeven more generous than the pay envelopes. Moreover, thecurrent protests against high pay and huge bonus payments maywell lead to even fatter option packages, compensationexperts predict, as companies increasingly rely on options inhopes of justifying generous compensation by linking it tocorporate performance.</LP><TEXT>   Galvanized by some fat gains from stock options, theSecurities and Exchange Commission and some members ofCongress are attacking the plans. And if, as some observersexpect, the government changes the accounting rules,companies may eventually find options less attractive thanthey are now. No longer would options seem cost-free;granting them would result in a charge against corporateincome.   Such a development wouldn't necessarily end the debate,partly because of arguments about whether such incentivesreally benefit the companies and partly because stock-optionplans differ significantly from company to company.   At International Multifoods Corp. in Minneapolis, AnthonyLuiso loves stock options so much that he even agreed to giveup pay for them. Right after becoming chairman of thefood-services company three years ago, he talked its boardinto tripling his option grants in exchange for forgoing $1million in pay over five years. Since then, the company haspeeled off peripheral operations, and its return on investedcapital and its stock price have risen, though not enough yetto fully compensate Mr. Luiso for his loss of income.   Says Mr. Luiso: &quot;Stock options link my interests withthose of the shareholders. How can that be bad?&quot;   Well, ask an IBM shareholder.   Under the International Business Machines Corp. formula,the more the company's stock price declines, the more optionsan executive generally gets.   Since John Akers became chief executive in 1985, IBM'sstock has fallen to about $88 a share from $130. If the stockmerely recovers the ground lost since Mr. Akers took office,he will rake in more than $6.6 million. But an investor whobought 100 shares then will only break even. If the stockrecovers just half of its 1985-92 decline, IBM's chairmanwill still get a $1.3 million gain, while the investor willbe out $2,100, plus commissions.   Not surprisingly, stock options tend to be generous. Theyare designed, after all, for high-level executives, who aregranted the right to buy the company's stock sometime in thefuture at a fixed price, usually the stock's price on the daythe options are granted. Stock options even have some valuewhen their exercise price is far above the stock's currentmarket price; the options can be considered a bet on thestock's resurgence.   But stock options generate the most attention -- sometimesoutrage -- at the time they are exercised. Though the methodsvary, an executive typically exercises options by buyingstock at the option price, then selling it immediately at themarket price, pocketing the gain.   This past year, Richard K. Eamer, chief executive ofNational Medical Enterprises Inc., exercised options thatgave him a gain of nearly $8.4 million. David Jones, chiefexecutive of Humana Inc., chalked up a $5 million profit.This year, Anthony J.F. O'Reilly, chief executive of H.J.Heinz Co., gained $71.5 million by exercising options. And atTime Warner Inc., a buy-out of options held by N.J. Nicholas,the co-chief executive who resigned under pressure lastmonth, is expected to help lift his total compensation to $24million to $44.5 million, depending on how generous thecompany is in the buy-out.   Stock options are now the fastest-growing segment ofexecutive pay. Over the past decade, according to TowersPerrin, a compensation consulting firm, the face value of theaverage stock-option grant -- the number of shares times theprice on the day the option was granted -- to chiefexecutives has more than doubled, to more than twice annualpay.   Stock options have become so popular because they have theadvantage over a huge amount of cash compensation inpermitting the issuing companies to contend that theexecutives won't benefit unless ordinary stockholders do.They also can seem to be without cost, though that notionoverlooks, among other things, the dilution of theoutstanding stock.   Because options are seen as an incentive to push forfuture gains rather than a reward for past achievements,companies are turning to option grants with a face value offive, seven or even 10 times a CEO's annual cashcompensation. As an executive gains only on the appreciationof the stock price, smaller grants won't do, says RobertSalwen, a consultant at William M. Mercer Inc. &quot;It's notenough of a carrot to affect performance,&quot; he says.   However, the surge in stock options may be laying thegroundwork for future controversies. A look at InternationalMultifoods and IBM shows how stock options work -- and whythey please executives but infuriate critics.   When Mr. Luiso stepped into the top job at InternationalMultifoods, securities analysts were jokingly calling itsjumble of unrelated businesses &quot;International Multidog.&quot; Mr.Luiso's predecessor had already begun restructuring, however,and had drawn up plans to sell off unrelated businesses, suchas a Mister Donut franchising unit, an animal-feed business,flour mills and a maker of soup mixes and spices.   But the restructuring was going slowly. To demonstrate theneed for greater speed, Mr. Luiso once jogged into amanagement meeting and delivered a lecture in a Tshirt andrunning shorts.   In addition, Mr. Luiso recalls, &quot;I went to the board andsaid, `I am willing to give up some money in exchange forsome options.' I had the idea in mind that if I put myself inthe same shoes I put either present and future investors, Icould say, `I am in this with you. I've got as much to gainas you do as a shareholder.'&quot;   He believed that giving up $1 million in pay over fiveyears &quot;would be painful. It was real money, really somethingon the line -- but also something that I could afford to giveup and still put food on the table.&quot; So, the company set hispay at a level that over five years would amount to $1million less than that of executives at similar-sizedcompanies. In the fiscal year ended Feb. 28, 1991, Mr.Luiso's salary and bonus totaled $698,111 -- about 10% lessthan his predecessor's in fiscal 1988.   Other executives at International Multifoods soon asked tofollow suit. &quot;I figured I'd be working very hard, and I'm ina position where I have some influence on the organization,&quot;says Duncan Cocroft, the $344,000-a-year chief financialofficer. About a year after Mr. Luiso's deal, Mr. Cocroft andthree other top executives each agreed to give up $70,000 ayear for five years in exchange for 63,636 options.   Executives at some other companies are making similarmoves. According to recent proxy disclosures, RobertCampbell, the new CEO at Sun Co., will take salary increasesin stock options for the next three years. At Avon ProductsInc., CEO James Preston recently said he was both freezinghis salary and cutting his bonus in exchange for stockoptions.   When salary is exchanged for options, setting the stockprice at which the option may be exercised becomes important.One widely accepted formula swaps the right to buy $3 to $4in stock for every dollar in cash. But General Mills Inc.trades the option to buy $8 to $10 in stock for every dollar;it factors in such considerations as forgone benefits andpension credits, usually based on cash salary and the riskinvolved in any option.   International Multifoods' Mr. Luiso got $5 of face valueof options for every dollar in cash forfeited. He says anoutside consulting firm worked out that exchange. &quot;I wasworrying about accomplishing our program, not about whetherthe options were this price or that price,&quot; he says.   Setting the terms can be controversial even when stockoptions are simply granted outright. IBM grants optionsaccording to a formula roughly pegged to annual pay. Nearlyhalf of all companies that offer options use such a formula,which every year gives an executive options to buy stockequal to, say, twice annual pay, says Stephen O'Byrne, aconsultant at Towers Perrin. Thus, if the stock declines, anexecutive would get more options.   In 1985, Mr. Akers received options on 20,436 IBM shareswhen the stock price was about $130. When the stock pricerose, to about $144, Mr. Akers got options on fewer shares,19,202. The stock price has dropped since then, while Mr.Akers's stock-option grants have risen steadily -- to 73,349shares in 1988 and 85,391 in 1989. The grant reached 95,562shares in 1990, when, at the time the option was granted, thestock price was about $96. The 1991 grant, which will bereported soon, should taper off a bit partly because Mr.Akers's pay fell 40% to less than $1.6 million last year,when IBM posted its first annual loss.   The spokesman for IBM says its stockoption grants areintended to &quot;advance our pay-for-performance philosophy. Theyprovide an incentive to increase performance from whereveryou are to another point.&quot; Since the computer industry is atan &quot;unprecedented level of turbulence, to weather the stormof that turbulence and come out ahead would, in and ofitself, be a significant accomplishment,&quot; he adds.   Whatever the price-setting formula, critics say it is hardto defend stock options. &quot;Let it not be said . . . that it isnecessary to provide options to retain and attract people,&quot;David Norr, an investment adviser, recently testified beforea Senate subcommittee. &quot;Is not being CEO at a majorcorporation incentive enough?&quot; And, citing averagebig-company CEO pay as calculated by some studies, he adds:&quot;Isn't cash compensation of $2 million yearly incentiveenough?&quot;   Even enthusiasts can't prove that options motivateexecutives to perform better. &quot;I can't sit here and say if Ididn't have this {stock-option} program, then mydecision-making process would be less good than it is now,&quot;Mr. Luiso says. Adds Paul Quinn, a group vice president whoalso swapped cash pay for International Multifoods stock:&quot;Would I behave any differently if I didn't have stockoptions? I don't think so.&quot;   Nevertheless, International Multifoods officers sayoptions help them think like shareholders. &quot;Shareholder valueis the lead item on every meeting's agenda,&quot; says RobertMaddocks, vice president of human resources. The result, theysay, is that they think about not only day-to-day businessbut also whether each operation uses the company's moneyeffectively. One decision they made: to sell the company'sagricultural business, freeing up cash for acquisitions. &quot;Itwas a commodity business,&quot; Mr. Cocroft says. &quot;There waslittle we could do to improve the product.&quot;   Some securities analysts applaud the unusual stock-optionarrangement. &quot;You do see management putting themselves in thechair of the shareholder and making decisions that reallyimpact the shareholder because {they} own the stock,&quot; saysStephen Carnes at Piper, Jaffrey andamp; Hopwood Inc. inMinneapolis.   So far, the International Multifoods executives say theyare just about breaking even on their stock-for-cash swap.Analysts say the price of the stock, which after a stocksplit has risen about 24% from its price in 1989, is beingheld back by the sale of the agricultural business and bysluggishness in the food-services industry.   But the executives say they expect handsome profits in thelong run. &quot;Do I want a big gain in this stock?&quot; Mr. Luisoasks. &quot;You betcha. I didn't enter into this to be altruistic.I hope to get back what I gave several times over.&quot;   Says Mr. Cocroft: &quot;Other than my house, this is where allmy net worth is.&quot; When he suggested giving up cash for stock,he says, &quot;My wife thought I was crazy. I have two daughtersin high school, ready to go to college, and $70,000 isn'tchicken feed to forgo.&quot; Today, he says his wife is reconciled-- sort of. &quot;She trusts me,&quot; he says. &quot;But she'd rather havethe money.&quot;   But critics say stock options reward executives not justfor their performance but for a booming stock market. Bigoption grants can produce big gains for small rises in stockprices. Moreover, most option plans reward executives forsuccess but don't penalize them for failure.   As many see it, even the highest-placed executive can'tinfluence the stock price very much. Indeed, Louis BrindisiJr., chairman of Strategic Compensation Associates Inc. inNew York, says studies suggest that at least 70% of thechange in a company's stock price depends only on changes inthe overall market. Last year, Ralston Purina Co. executiveswere awarded $49.8 million in stock outright -- including$16.2 million for Chief Executive William P. Stiritz -- whenthe company's shares rose above $100. But that stockpricerise exactly matched the rise in the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage.   Companies could, as International Multifoods did, requireexecutives to forgo cash for options. Since options areintended to make corporate executives more likeentrepreneurs, or real owners, some experts go even further:They suggest that executives actually put up real money fortheir options, buying them not in forgone salary but in cash.That, they say, would put executives' real financial futureat risk, just as an investor's or entrepreneur's is.   Since one criticism of stock options is that they rewardonly for increases in stock prices, and hence often just fora market rise, some experts suggest tying option grants toachieving some corporate goals. The options would becomeavailable to executives only when the company, for example,improved its return on equity.   Some companies are experimenting with granting stockoptions not at the market price but at some higher price.Thus, the executive would profit only after the stock hasrisen substantially. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.announced just such a plan last week. However, the ATandamp;T plandoesn't introduce any real risk to the executives because thestock options are layered on top of all other compensation,including regular stock options.</TEXT></DOC>
