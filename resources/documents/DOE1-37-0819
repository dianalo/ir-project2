Renal allografts transplanted to the groin of recipient animalswere studied using a 1.89 Tesla horizontal bore magnet. The relativeintracellular concentrations of phosphorus metabolites such as adenosinetriphosphate and inorganic phosphate as well as intracellular pH weredetermined by {sup 31}P NMR on days 4, 7, 10, and 14 following transplantationacross a major histocompatibility mismatch. Recipient rats chosen tobe rejectors received no immunosuppression while animals chosen to benonrejectors received cyclosporine during the first 7 days followingtransplantation. By day 7, all rejector rats could be distinguished fromnonrejector rats by their higher relative concentration of inorganicphosphate and their lower relative concentration of adenosine triphosphate.These NMR findings correlated with histologic findings of renal infarctionprobably related to vascular rejection in the allografts. {sup 31}P NMRspectroscopy may have application as a noninvasive tool in the differentialdiagnosis of posttransplantation renal insufficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
