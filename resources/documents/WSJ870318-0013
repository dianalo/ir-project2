Program trading involves the computer-directed buying and selling of blocks of stocks and related indexes and futures contracts to take advantage of various differences in price. Critics of program trading have blamed the technique for recent wide swings in the stock market, such as the drop of more than 80 points in the Dow Jones Industrial Average that took place one day last September.    John J. Phelan Jr., chairman of the Big Board, has recently been critical of program trading, arguing that such complex trading techniques are open to abuses.    The Big Board said a final report is expected to be issued before the end of the year. </TEXT></DOC>
