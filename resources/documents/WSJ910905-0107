The benchmark 30-year Treasury issue fell nearly 1/4point, or nearly $2.50 for each $1,000 face amount, takingthe yield up to 8.06%.</LP><TEXT>   Traders said more and more investors are weighing recenteconomic reports and are coming to the view that the FederalReserve may not reduce interest rates anytime soon. However,bond investors are largely waiting for this Friday's Augustemployment report before arriving at any conclusions aboutthe current strength of the U.S. economy.   Most trading activity occurred in the morning. Dealersfound few buyers to take bonds off the hands of profit-takersand nervous bulls, and so prices were marked down. By noon,trading slowed to a crawl as hundreds of traders andinvestors in the government bond market tuned into the livebroadcast of Congressional hearings over the Salomon Treasuryauction scandal.   No hearings are scheduled for today, however, and themarket's attention is likely to swing back to economicfundamentals. One group of investors that has turned negativeon the bond market recently are asset allocators, who juggleinvestments between stocks, bonds and cash in search of highreturns with moderate risks.   &quot;Our bond models moved to neutral last week,&quot; said CharlesDuBois, who oversees $1.8 billion in asset allocationinvestments at Chancellor Capital Management. Mr. DuBois saidChancellor backed away from a bullish stance in the bondmarket because of the fall in bond yields in August and thestrength of economic indicators. &quot;Those bond market negativesmore than offset the positives of lower inflation and weakcommodity prices,&quot; said Mr. DuBois. &quot;Over the shorter term weare moderately favoring stocks over bonds,&quot; he added. At theend of August, Chancellor shrank the average maturity of itsportfolios to 10-years from 12-years where it stood from theend of June.   Asset allocators believe that bond prices may be reachinga peak. Richard Crowell, who oversees $3.5 billion in assetallocation investments as president of PanAgora AssetManagement Inc., also cut his bond holdings recently to 16%of total investments from 19%.   &quot;Our model is telling us that we've reached a {low} inyields and that stocks are more attractive because of theimproving economy,&quot; said Mr. Crowell. &quot;We remain bullish onthe stock market and slightly negative on bonds,&quot; he added.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of100 23/32 to yield 8.06%, compared with a price of 100 30/32late Tuesday. Dealers said there were some trades involvingselling 30-year bonds and buying two-year notes, resulting infirmer prices in some short-term securities.   Among other Treasury issues, the 10-year note fell lessthan 1/8 of a point to 100 13/32 to yield 7.81%. Two-yearnotes were unchanged at 100 4/32 to yield 6.29%.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          The Bank of England signaled a reduction in the baselending rate yesterday to 10.5% from 11%, driving down yieldson money market and mortgage rates. The base rate is a keylending rate, influenced by the Bank of England throughmoney-market dealings, to which all other loan rates aretied. Analysts were surprised at the timing of the move, butagreed that falling inflation gave the central bank room toguide short-term rates lower.   &quot;There is no doubt that the cut in base rates is justifiedagainst a background of declining inflation,&quot; said GeoffreyDennis, international economist at James Capel Inc., NewYork.   Short-term British Treasury issues, or gilts, rose on themove, with many investors expecting further rate reductionsahead. But longer-term gilts fell, on concerns of risingsupply and the central bank's behavior in what may be anelection year.   Michael Saunders, U.K. economist at Salomon BrothersInternational, said the rate cut &quot;brings into very sharpfocus the political uncertainty&quot; of investing in longdatedgilts because of the possibility of looser fiscal andmonetary policies as elections approach. The cut added tospeculation that the ruling Conservatives may be consideringan autumn election, following a weekend opinion poll that putthem ahead of the opposition Labor Party for the first timesince April. Cutting rates now allows for another rate cutlater, possibly at the time of the Conservative Partyconference which begins Oct. 8.   Aside from the political picture, Mr. Dennis of JamesCapel thinks that short-term gilts should remain attractivefor international investors because of falling inflation inthe United Kingdom.   &quot;We are expecting inflation to drop below 4% in October,&quot;said Mr. Dennis. &quot;Three-month bills yielding 10.3% areobviously relatively attractive.&quot;   Trading in other foreign bond markets was quiet yesterday.German mark bond prices finished mixed after an early rallyevaporated, while prices of French Treasurys finished littlechanged in quiet trading.                                                                                                          Corporate andamp; Junk Securities                                                                                                          Corporate issuers crept back to the credit marketsyesterday, offering $500 million of new debt securities.   Johnson andamp; Johnson, the New Brunswick, N.J.-basedpharmaceutical and health products concern, was among theissuers selling debt.   The company, one of the few remaining U.S. corporations tosport a triple-A rating, offered $200 million of seven-yearnotes through underwriters led by Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   The notes were priced at par to yield 8%, or 0.38 of apercentage point above the Treasury's seven-year note.   Leslie Fishman, manager of finance at Johnson andamp; Johnson,said while the company has sold some medium-term notes fromtime to time, it hasn't offered debt in the public marketsince July 1990.   Proceeds from the debt offering will be used for generalcorporate purposes. The company doesn't have any additionalpublic debt sales planned for the near future.   In the secondary market for investment-grade corporatedebt, prices of highgrade bonds were unchanged to slightlylower.   Aside from Johnson andamp; Johnson, the Province of Manitobaalso tapped the debt markets, offering $300 million of30-year debentures.   The debentures were priced to yield 8.911%, or about 0.87percentage point above the Treasury's 30-year bond.   In the junk bond market, prices of high-yield bonds, orspeculative-grade securities with low credit ratings or nocredit ratings at all, gained 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000face amount, on average.   Among the gainers were bonds of Owens-Illinois Inc. whichstarted rising on speculation that the company may useproceeds from the planned sale of its health care businessesto retire debt.   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commissionlast week, Health Care andamp; Retirement Corp., a subsidiary ofOwens-Illinois, said it plans an initial public offering of15,476,000 shares of common stock. At the time, the companysaid it will use proceeds from the stock sale to acquirehealth care businesses from Owens-Illinois.   &quot;The speculation is that Owens-Illinois will use proceedsfrom the asset sale to retire debt,&quot; says John Shippee, ananalyst at BT Securities Corp., a subsidiary of Bankers TrustNew York Corp.   However, Mr. Shippee notes that &quot;based upon the creditagreement as it stands today, they could not use the proceedsto buy back subordinated debt.&quot; Instead, Owens-Illinois wouldhave to use the funds to pay off its bank lenders.   Nevertheless, Owens-Illinois' 12.75% subordinateddebentures, due in 1999, rose $10 for each $1,000 face amountto end at 100 1/4.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          Prices of municipal bonds ended little changed after thesecond quiet trading session in a row.   Among active issues, the Municipality of MetropolitanSeattle's 6.875% of 2031 finished unchanged at 97 3/4 toyield 7.01%.   In limited new-issue action yesterday, a Lehman Brothersgroup repriced $155 million Pennsylvania Higher EducationAssistance Agency's student loan revenue bonds.   The repricing lowered yields on one series of bonds by0.05 percentage point from levels seen at the originalpricing earlier in the session. The repricings also raisedthe yield on another series of bonds by 0.06 percentagepoint.   The bonds, which are insured by Ambac Indemnity Corp,carry a top yield of 8.41% for residual interest bondsmaturing in 2026, changed from 8.35%.   The bonds are rated triple-A by both Moody's InvestorsService Inc. and Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. due to theinsurance.   Elsewhere in the municipal market, Financial GuarantyInsurance Co., a muni bond insurer, had its claims-payingability rated triple-A by Fitch Investors Service yesterday.While there are other triple-A rated muni bond insurers,Fitch managing director Mark Cohen said, &quot;FGIC is the onlymunicipal bond insurer that has a triple-A credit rating fromall three rating agencies.&quot;   He added: &quot;This is a company that has managed to meet ourvery comprehensive standards.&quot;   FGIC is a unit of triple-A rated General Electric CapitalCorp., which in turn is a unit of General Electric Co.                                                                                                          Mortgage andamp; Asset-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Prices of mortgage securities ended mostly unchanged.

Gold 8.5% securities were unchangedat 99 4/32 and Federal National Mortgage Association 8.5%securities were unchanged at 98 28/32.   The only new deal in either the asset-backed ormortgage-backed markets was a $750 million credit-cardsecurities deal, backed by Chase Manhattan Bank Visa andMasterCard receivables.
