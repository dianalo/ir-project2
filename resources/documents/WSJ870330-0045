London-based Dixons said Friday that it paid $95 a share -- considerably more than its tender offer -- but the move effectively blocks a competing offer for Pittsburgh-based Cyclops by another group of investors.    Dixons bought the nearly 2.5 million-share block for about $233 million from Jefferies Group Inc., a Los Angeles-based brokerage that often assembles big blocks from arbitragers and institutions. The transaction boosted Dixons's holdings to about 83% of the stock outstanding and 79% of the shares outstanding on a fully diluted basis. Dixons, an electric appliance retailer, previously held 925,341 shares, or a 22% stake in Cyclops, a specialty steel, nonresidential-construction and retail concern.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Cyclops closed at $94, up $2.50.    Dixons said it expects to proceed with a merger between a Dixons subsidiary and Cyclops and will increase the amount to be paid in the merger to $95 from the tender offer price of $90.25 for each of the 880,000 remaining shares of Cyclops on a fully diluted basis.    Cyclops said, &quot;We supported the Dixons offer and so we're pleased that they made this move.&quot;    Last week, only 20% of Cyclops shareholders tendered their shares to Dixons under the $90.25-a-share offer. And more than half the shareholders who had previously tendered their shares during an earlier tender offer withdrew their shares. That left only a few alternatives for Dixons in order to proceed with a Cyclops merger: buy shares on the open market, make another tender offer or privately negotiate a purchase.    The negative shareholder response to Dixons temporarily bolstered prospects for rival bidder Cyacq Corp. -- a group led by Audio/Video Affiliates Inc., a Dayton, Ohio-based consumer-electronics retailer, and Citicorp Capital Investors Ltd., a Citicorp unit.    The Cyacq tender offer of $92.50 a share expires at 12:01 a.m. EST next Saturday. Peter Kellner, of Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., which advised Dixons, said he believes the Cyacq tender offer is moot.    &quot;Even if they are able to buy all the shares, that will only give them 17%,&quot; Mr. Kellner said. &quot;I don't think it will do a lot of good.&quot; Cyacq officials weren't available for comment.    Mr. Kellner said Dixons will sell the industrial division to a unit of Alleghany Corp., despite another offer by the Citicorp unit to pay more for that business. He added that no final decision had been reached concerning Cyclops's prized Silo Inc., a retail chain of appliance and consumer-electronics stores, or the nonresidential-construction business. </TEXT></DOC>
