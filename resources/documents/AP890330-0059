Sylvia Lane said she withdrew her son Mark Weaver's feeding tubeat 12:01 a.m. before leaving for her job on the early morning shiftat a nursing home. A probate judge on Feb. 27 gave her permissionto do so beginning today.   The feeding tube has kept her son alive nearly four years. Mrs.Lane said doctors believe Weaver, 26, will die in a week or two.   Only then will prosecutors say whether they will file a murdercharge against Noel Pagan, who served three years in prison foraggravated assault on Weaver. A judge this week refused to allowPagan to intervene in the case.   Doctors said Weaver has no prospect for recovery from a``persistent vegetative state'' caused by stab wounds to the neckthat deprived his brain of oxygen.</TEXT></DOC>
