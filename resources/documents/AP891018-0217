We will not be pushed or pressured,'' he told a conventionof fundamentalist Christians.   Still, Israeli leaders appeared to be trying to dampen asmoldering conflict with the United States following Shamir'sremarks Tuesday that Israel would rather face conflict withWashington than accept a U.S.-backed plan that could lead to talkswith the Palestine Liberation Organization.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens telephoned Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III and they spoke for 45 minutes on Baker's efforts torestart the Middle East peace process, Israel radio said. It gaveno details and Arens' spokesman declined comment.   On Tuesday night, Shamir called President Bush about Shamir'splanned mid-November visit to Washington.   ``They talked about the peace initiative and how they canadvance it,'' Shamir's office said. ``Both think it is veryimportant to meet in order to get a better understanding betweenthe United States and Israel about the peace initiative.''   Israel radio said the issue of Shamir's statements Tuesday didnot come up.   Before calling Bush, Shamir told members of his right-wing Likudbloc, ``We must accept the assumption that we may be entering atense period with the United States.''   ``This time the battle is hard. It's a miracle that, thus far,we have held our own against the world, where no element supportsour position.''   Later he told a Likud rally in Ramle that ``the stone-throwers,the firebombers have not succeeded in driving us into the arms ofthe PLO. It is not possible that when they fail to do this, othersby diplomatic means ... would try to bring us to meetings with thePLO.''   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutweiller called Shamir'sstatements ``unhelpful'' and said the United States ``is notlooking for a fight with Israel.''   But Shamir made it clear in his speech to the Christianconvention Wednesday night that Israel will not budge in opposingdirect or indirect talks with the PLO or withdrawal from theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.   He accused the PLO of striving toward ``the creation of aPalestinian state in place of Israel. ... Let me make it veryclear. There will be no second Arab state in the land of Israel.''   The biblical names of Judea and Samaria embrace what is now theWest Bank.   The United States advocates trading land for peace. Bakerproposed consultations among Israel, Egypt and the United Statesaimed at convening a meeting between Israel and Palestinians.   Shamir's Likud bloc sees the Israeli-Palestinian meeting asbringing the PLO into talks through the back door.</TEXT></DOC>
