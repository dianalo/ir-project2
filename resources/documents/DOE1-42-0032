Thefirst of two volumes, summarizes the industry awareness and interestin using these technologies. Also included is a look at factors playinga major role in the development of the mining robotics industry, suchas safety, productivity, labour and the economic climate. The role ofEnergy, Mines and Resources Canada (EMR)/CANMET is also discussed. Finally,recommendations are made as to how Canada, through EMR, can ensure Canada'sparticipation in the development of robotics in the mining industry.Volume two is comprised of the contact records. These are abbreviatednotes of conversations which took place between the interviewers andtheir contacts in a number of Canadian and US mines and associated governmentand private agencies. (The interviews represent the opinions of the respondents,not necessarily that of their companies). The survey indicated that theindustry is essentially negative to the idea of robotics in mining, butthey were able to suggest many potential areas of application, especiallyat the short term level.</TEXT></DOC>
