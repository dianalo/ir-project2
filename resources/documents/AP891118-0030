And atevery rescue we have there are babies saved.''   More than 1,000 protesters traveled from around the country tooppose the city's new ordinance banning anti-abortiondemonstrations within 100 feet of an abortion clinic.   Members of Operation Rescue are seeking a temporary restrainingorder that would allow them to protest. A hearing is scheduled infederal court on Tuesday.
