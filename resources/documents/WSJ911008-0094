ATandamp;T is looking for companies that &quot;need access to capital. . . and an owner with patience,&quot; said Richard S. Bodman,the company's senior vice president, corporate strategy anddevelopment. But he said ATandamp;T isn't planning any bids on thescale of its $7.4 billion NCR acquisition.</LP><TEXT>   Discussing ATandamp;T's growth strategy at thetelecommunications industry's quadrennial exposition here,Mr. Bodman said ATandamp;T must change its &quot;whole outlook from oneof being a company that is just holding market share togrowth in everything we do.&quot; He said the company will seeknew investment opportunities &quot;in all of its businesses,including electronic mail, video conferencing, any businessapplications linking computing and telephony.&quot;   Overseas, ATandamp;T can market its reputation of building asophisticated communications network that delivers service&quot;at prices significantly less than anybody else. Athree-minute call in the U.S. costs one-fifth of what itcosts on the Continent,&quot; said Mr. Bodman, who joined thecompany about a year ago after stints as president ofWashington Investment Corp. and before that Comsat GeneralCorp.'s chief executive officer.   The goal is to meet ATandamp;T Chairman Robert E. Allen's planto expand revenue at least 10% annually over the next 10years and derive 50% of the company's revenue from overseasby the end of the same period. That would mean total revenueof at least $100 billion by 2001. By the end of this yearATandamp;T will get 22% of its more than $43 billion in annualrevenue from overseas, including NCR's results. That wouldindicate much slower growth in revenue from domesticactivities than from overseas.   A cornerstone of ATandamp;T's global growth strategy was the NCRacquisition, Mr. Bodman said. But ATandamp;T also made a thoroughinvestigation of other potential targets over the past twoyears, including Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co.and Apple Computer Inc., Mr. Bodman said.   ATandamp;T passed on approaching Digital because it was &quot;headinginto a restructuring&quot; and it didn't make sense, given ATandamp;T'sown massive restructuring effort since its 1984 breakup.Hewlett-Packard was a target, but ATandamp;T decided that its otherbusinesses, such as instrumentation equipment and printers,were too foreign to ATandamp;T's central focus of networking.   Making a bid for Apple was rejected after ATandamp;T strategistsdecided that the relatively young &quot;average age of its workers. . . and their mental outlook {was} completely differentthan us.&quot; Too bad the fit wasn't quite right, he added, sinceout of all the computer targets on ATandamp;T's short list &quot;Appleis ahead of the others in combining computers andcommunications.&quot;   NCR, said Mr. Bodman, was found to have &quot;terrificsynergies {considering} every time you initiate an ATMtransaction you initiate a phone call.&quot; And NCR's overseaspresence, including 70 years in Japan and 60 in Germany,would give ATandamp;T a solid foothold outside the U.S.   &quot;ATandamp;T is a consumer marketing company . . . spendinghundreds of millions of dollars a year selling a concept, a{communications} system for everybody,&quot; he said. &quot;But we'vegot a lot to learn from NCR about how to become a globalcompany.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
