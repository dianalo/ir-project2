The Khmer Rouge said in a radio broadcast the seizure opened thedoor for an assault on the city of Battambang, and it advisedgovernment soldiers to leave the area ``in order to stay alive.''   The guerrillas said they took Pailin, along the Thai border, onSunday after a two-year offensive.   Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila of Thailand confirmed thereport and said the guerrillas also captured artillery guns, tanksand ammunition stockpiles. He was the first Thai official toconfirm the guerrilla takeover.   It could be a major victory for the Khmer Rouge in its war tooust the government Vietnam installed after its 1978 invasion.   Government soldiers had vowed to hold onto Pailin, which isalong Route 10 leading to the provincial capital of Battambang, 40miles away. Battambang is Cambodia's largest city after thecapital, Phnom Penh.   A Khmer Rouge Army broadcast said guerrillas routed the 196thdivision, two brigades and three provincial regiments in theirtwo-day final offensive on Pailin.   ``Pailin town has a very important strategic role for theVietnamese enemy and puppets, militarily, politically andeconomically,'' it said. ``Particularly in the military aspect, itis a strategic door directly relating to the survival of Battambangtown.''   The broadcast said pro-Vietnamese forces face serious problemstrying to move soldiers and supplies to defend Route 10 andBattambang.   ``Parents and compatriots,'' it said, ``please call on yourchildren and husbands to quickly desert for home ... in order tostay alive.   ``What is the use of the remaining district and provincial unitsfighting and dying?''   The broadcast said some Vietnamese disguised as Cambodiansoldiers helped the Cambodian troops defend Pailin.   Vietnam said it pulled the last of its soldiers from Cambodialast month, but the guerrillas say thousands are still in thecountry.   The Vietnamese withdrawal raised fears the Cambodian army wouldnot be able to hold its own against the Khmer Rouge and the twonon-communist guerrilla groups, the Khmer People's NationalLiberation Front and the army of Prince Norodom Sihanouk. The KhmerRouge is the strongest of the coalition.   Thai military sources said the Khmer Rouge killed 120 governmentsoldiers and captured 17 at Pailin.   Siddhi, who spoke at a weekly news briefing, said neither thePhnom Penh government nor the guerrillas is strong enough to win aclear victory in the war. ``In the end they will have to compromiseand come back to negotiations,'' he said.   Thailand is leading efforts to revive peace negotiations,stalled since the failure of an international conference in Parisin August.   The main stumbling block was the Cambodian government's refusalto agree to a government role for the Khmer Rouge, which massacredhundreds of thousands of Cambodians in the 1970s before it wasousted.</TEXT></DOC>
