The General Accounting Office report, requested by theSenate Banking Committee, will prompt questions next weekwhen Robert Clarke, the comptroller of the currency,testifies before the committee at his confirmation hearing.His agency was the lead regulator of the failed bank.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Clarke was nominated for a second five-year term aschief supervisor of 3,900 nationally chartered banks lastDecember, but confirmation hearings have been delayed pendingseveral investigations into the failure of the Bank of NewEngland, one of the costliest bank collapses ever. Its demisecost the Bank Insurance Fund $2.5 billion.   The GAO report said that the bank examiners reportedproblems with the Boston-based bank's lending operations andpoorly controlled growth between 1985 and 1988 but that theywaited until 1989 to take enforcement action to correct theproblems.   Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.), chairman of the committee,wouldn't comment on Mr. Clarke's renomination, but hecriticized the agency in a statement. &quot;The office of theComptroller of the Currency's philosophy of lax supervisionand narrow examination is defective,&quot; he said. &quot;The Americantaxpayer cannot afford this 1980s style of look-the-other-waybanking regulation.&quot;   In a statement, Mr. Clarke said agency officials havetestified four times before congressional committees on theBank of New England. &quot;In all four hearings, {they}acknowledged shortcomings in the agency's supervision of Bankof New England during the 1980s,&quot; he said. He added that theagency began taking steps in late 1989 to prevent similarproblems, including more stringent follow-ups. It took 559enforcement actions in 1990, 35% more than the 415 it took inthe previous year.   The agency also created a peer review program in whichsupervisors from one district audit the findings of another.And it replaced the deputy comptroller for the Northeast whosupervised the examiners at the Bank of New England.   The GAO report said that although loans to insiders at thebank were substantial, they didn't cause the bank's failure.The report, however, called the loans &quot;symptomatic of theliberal underwriting standards and poor management.&quot;   Most of the insider loans, which totaled 1.5% of thebank's assets, weren't made on preferential terms. Anexception, however, was $4.3 million in loans given to onedirector at low interest rates and other preferential terms.   &quot;We believe there is a conflict of interest when a bankingorganization's directors, who have responsibility to thedepositors, are among the major beneficiaries of theorganization's poor underwriting practices,&quot; the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
