Under Mrs. Thatcher's leadership, the governing party hadtrailed Labor in opinion polls for 16 months. Labor is the mainopposition party in Parliament.   But a poll of about 1,100 voters Friday found that more voterspreferred either former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine orChancellor of the Exchequer John Major, to Labor Party leader NeilKinnock.   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd would put the Tories neck andneck with Labor, with Hurd having a slight edge, according to thepoll, taken by ICM for the Sunday Correspondent newspaper. The pollwas published today.   Forty-seven percent of people asked would vote for Heseltine,compared with 38 percent who would vote Labor, according to thepoll of 1,139 people. Major received 46 percent of the vote,compared with 39 percent for Labor, and Hurd had 43 percent of thevote, compared with Labor's 41 percent, the poll showed.   No margin of error was given. No poll can be 100 percentaccurate, however, and there is usually a margin of error of atleast two or three percentage points with a sample of that size,poll watchers said.   The 372 Conservative Party members of the House of Commons willvote for a leader on Tuesday. If none of the three candidatesreceives a majority, a third ballot will be held Thursday.   Mrs. Thatcher resigned on Thursday, after it appeared she wouldlose a Conservative Party leadership vote to Haseltine, who hadmade a strong showing in a first round of leadership balloting lastTuesday.   Hurd and Major, Cabinet ministers no longer shackled by loyalty,immediately jumped into the leadership contest with Heseltine.   The latest poll is similar to the findings of a Harris pollreleased Friday by Independent Television News that also predictedan upturn in Conservative Party fortunes under a new primeminister.   That poll, of 1,107 voters on Thursday, found that theConservatives, with any of the three candidates as leader, wouldbeat Labor if a general election were held immediately. A generalelection must be held before mid-1992.   The poll found voters ranked the candidates in the same order -with Heseltine leading Labor by 10 points, Major by seven pointsand Hurd by four. No margin of error was given in the Harris poll.      Supporters of the 65-year-old Mrs. Thatcher have angrily accusedConservatives of what one called ``political matricide'' in forcingher to quit after 15 years as party leader and 11{ years as primeminister.   High inflation, rising interest rates, an unpopular new tax andher lone opposition among European Community leaders to financialand political integration were among factors that undermined hersupport.   Cabinet colleagues and campaign managers told her she could notmuster enough support to win in further balloting next week.   Her opponents in the party feared that under her continuingleadership the Conservatives would lose to Labor at the nextgeneral election. Labor has been in opposition since 1979.   Conservative legislators returning home for the weekend were metFriday by anger from grass-roots backers of Mrs. Thatcher.   Peter Stainforth, local Conservative Party treasurer atStevenage, about 25 miles north of central London, reportedparticular rancor over Sir Geoffrey Howe. The deputy prime ministerquit on Nov. 1 and bitterly attacked Mrs. Thatcher in a Commonsspeech on Nov. 13.   ``I cannot express how the constituency feels about thatlatter-day Brutus who was the first to plunge his dagger into hisleader's back,'' Stainforth said.</TEXT></DOC>
