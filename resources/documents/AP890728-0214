Frustrated byfarming troubles or left without jobs when factories close, manyleave houses, schools, even whole towns abandoned to the winds.Congressional hearings on the crisis begin this week. Yet as onepart of rural America disappears, another part is hanging on, evenflourishing: the town that attracts a shopping mall, that happensto lie along an interstate route. In this first story in an APExtra series, ``Rural Crossroads,'' Midwest Regional ReporterSharon Cohen and Mountain States Regional Reporter Tad Bartimuslook at the two rural Americas.</TEXT><BYLINE>By SHARON COHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>and</BYLINE><BYLINE>TAD BARTIMUS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writers</BYLINE><TEXT>   As unobtrusive as a church bell, as final as a funeral notice,the passing away of so much of rural America began with agoing-out-of-business sign.   Perhaps it appeared in a shoe store window, or the florist'sshop where every bride of the past 50 years ordered her bouquet. Ithappened because the railroad died, the hotel closed, jobs driedup, folks moved on.   The vast stretch of America, beyond the nighttime glow ofcities, where stars and a few street lights mean rural life, hasbeen shrinking and struggling for decades.   As the nation faces the 1990s, farmers and small-town citizensno longer live in the countryside found in a Willa Cather novel oron a Norman Rockwell canvas. Today there are two rural Americas:one is dying, the other surviving, often by its wits.   Isolated, one-industry towns and backroads hamlets that oncedefined ``country'' are fading into history. At the same timemodern little communities with diverse economic foundations andfortuitous locations are going strong.   ``The remote rural areas that are falling farther and fartherbehind have little prospect for attracting industry,'' said CynthiaDuncan, associate director of the Rural Economic Policy Program ofthe Aspen Institute, a think tank that does social and economicresearch. ``Rural areas that are closer to cities ... are moreresilient and are going to recover faster.''   The dying rural America is evident in the country school, itsonce-white clapboards peeling gray in the unrelenting wind of theNebraska prairie, and in the dilapidated homesteads of North Dakotawhere roof-high lilac bushes grow untended.   A way of life is disappearing when, in Montana, a homemakers'group cancels its annual Mother's Day tea because so few membersremain.   But the other rural America, the one that will survive, has itssymbols, too.   Aggressive communities in Missouri and other states enticebusiness with free land and other incentives. In Iowa, little townsstruggling to pay for police protection or individual schools arebanding together in ``clusters'' that share the costs. In Texas,the county with the largest quail population started organizinghunts that now attract hunters from 26 states.   ``If they can do it, you can do it all over,'' said DavidGuarino of the Texas Department of Agriculture, which helped with agrant.   For almost two centuries, the historical and emotional pull ofrural and small-town life put the heartbeat in the heartland. Theidealized myth of a homogeneous rural America, where a family livedoff a bountiful land, shopped in a small town free of crime andperpetuated itself in prosperity and harmony through grit, hardwork and lofty moral principles goes back to the day the Pilgrimslanded.   Thomas Jefferson articulated the ideal, holding that landownership must be broad-based, that democracy must be rooted in theindividual efforts of small farmers and merchants.   And yet, except for a brief ``rural renaissance'' in the 1970s,when 4.5 million people fled the cities to earn livings in thecountry as coal and farming boomed, much of rural life has been ona long decline.   ``In the '80s,'' said Calvin Beale, chief Agriculture Departmentdemographer, ``we simply do not see many of theback-to-the-landers, homesteader or urban refugees who go out toupper Michigan, upper Minnesota, the Ozarks, northeastern NewEngland to make their living in a small-town community because theyprefer to do it.''   The '80s added new crises to old challenges: tumbling landvalues, farm foreclosures, two droughts, school consolidation,falling commodity and petroleum prices, deregulation and decliningservices, a brain drain and a loss of jobs caused by mechanization,factory closings and increased use of cheap Third World labor.   The result has been an exodus to urban centers and direpredictions for the future.   ``Unless action is taken, virtually every citizen of the countrywill be forced to live in a metropolitan area,'' said Rep. GlennEnglish, D-Okla., whose House Agriculture subcommittee openshearings Monday on rural development. The first hearing is inClarksdale, Miss. Future hearings will be in Amarillo, Texas;Marshalltown, Iowa, and Blackfoot, Idaho.   Nearly 1 million people left rural America in 1986-'87. ``Thatscenario is good for no one,'' said English. ``It would overburdenour cities and suburbs as much as it would devastate our ruralcommunities.''   Through the '80s, rural America has witnessed a decline inservices and jobs and a rise in poverty.   ``You can draw a lot of parallels between remote rural areas andthe inner city,'' said the Aspen Institute's Duncan. ``In bothcases, people with education and skills left. ... You end upwithout a middle class, without role models. They don't have theeconomic security and economic opportunity. They can't invest inthe schools and good government at the local level.''   Television has let the rural poor ``know how different theirlives are from the rest of the world,'' said David Lollis, directorof the Federation of Appalachian Housing Enterprises in Kentucky.   Propping up many dying small towns is the elderly retiredpopulation, which lives off transfer payments such as pensions,medical and disability insurance and income maintenance programs.In nearly half of Kansas' counties in 1985, 44 percent of incomecame from transfer payments or property income.   ``The world has changed and our population has aged,'' said MarySchissel, city clerk in Dougherty, Iowa, a town of 128. ``A lot ofour leaders want to take a break. They're in their mid- tolate-60s. They say it's time for someone else to do this.''   But who? Not young people. Of the hundreds of thousands leavingrural places in 1986-87, one-third were 18 to 24 years old. Morethan half had at least one year of college.   ``The brain drain in rural areas is enormous,'' said BobBergland, agriculture secretary under President Carter and now headof the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association. ``The kidswho stay are the ones who fail to graduate. ... You can't get anemployer who requires a high level of skill to come into a placewith crummy schools.''   And without jobs, people leave.   ``If you've got a college degree, about the only thing you cando is become a teacher or a nurse, and there are dozens ofapplicants for every job,'' said Anne Smith of Bainville, Mont.,who spends her work week 100 miles from her husband so herteacher's salary can help pay for their ranch.   Hard times on ranches and farms in the early '80s also pushedmany people off the land.   ``Our biggest worry right now is that we've lost an entiregeneration of farmers,'' said Heather Ball, an economist with theTexas Department of Agriculture. ``You don't go out to rural Texasand find young farmers anymore. The whole future has packed up andmoved away.''</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
