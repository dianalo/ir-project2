For the experiments, 5 liter tetra-bag was used as respirationbag which was equipped with a breathing valve and breathing tube of anoxygen mask, through the mouth-piece of which man could breath. Oxygengas concentration was analyzed by polarographic oxygen analyzer and carbondioxide by infrared analyzer. The respiration bag was filled by oxygenor air for comparison. By using the experimental result, number of respirationand the concentration of oxygen, carbon dioxide were correlated as graph.For several cases, number of respirations before the concentration ofcarbon dioxide reached 3% was studied.
