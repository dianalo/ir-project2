You bet I'll miss this,'' he said. ``But Ialso think it's time for me to go do something else.''   Valukas' resignation takes effect Dec. 3, when he will return toJenner and Block, the firm he left to take the prosecutor's post.   He said he believes his tenure ``made things a little fairer inthis community,'' noting prosecutions of people with political orfinancial clout.   ``We attained convictions in virtually all cases,'' Valukassaid, which suggests ``our judgment was sound, our lawyering good.I hope that would be a hallmark of this time in office.'' He saidthe office's conviction rate was around 97 percent during histenure.   Word that Valukas might leave had been circulating in Chicagoand at his announcement _ even before in some cases _ localofficials were quick with praise.   ``His efforts helped clean up every area he looked into, whetherit be the judicial system or drugs or white-collar crime,'' saidGov. James R. Thompson, who once held the post.   Valukas said his salary was $77,500 and that he had one child incollege and another scheduled to begin next fall. He declined tosay what his earnings had been in private practice.   Some of Valukas' earliest successes came at the expense ofpoliticians in Chicago's City Hall and from there he took onorganized crime in the suburbs and white-collar crime in business.   News that a federal investigation was under way in the world'stwo largest commodities exchanges rocked the financial world inJanuary. In August, 46 traders and a clerk were accused offraudulent trading practices at the Chicago Board of trade and theChicago Mercantile Exchange.   Asked whether he was likely to take another crack at the tradingpractices before leaving, Valukas said, laughing, ``I hope so.''   He also directed the contract-fraud case against Rockford-basedSundstrand Corp., which resulted in more than $115 million inpenalties against the aerospace contractor in October 1988 _ thelargest such settlement in Defense Department history.   He directed Operation Incubator, a probe of City Hallcorruption; Operation Safebet, an investigation of organizedcrime's suburban influence; and Operation Phocus, a probe ofcorruption in licensing.   In addition, he oversaw the recent wave of indictments againstmembers of El Rukn, a South Side gang, on charges ranging fromconspiracy to murder related to drug running, and directedfollow-up on Operation Greylord, a probe of Cook County courtcorruption that sent 15 judges to jail.   President Bush will name Valukas' successor.</TEXT></DOC>
