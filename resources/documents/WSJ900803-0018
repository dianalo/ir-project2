The Iraqi president already had the Arab world's biggestarmy. Now, his lightning conquest of Kuwait has in one strokedoubled the oil under his control -- to fully 20% of theworld's reserves.</LP><TEXT>   But while his invasion of neighboring oil fields andterritory may ease Iraq's immediate economic and strategicconcerns, the political fallout from his aggression hasclearly isolated Mr. Hussein in the international community.The U.S., the Soviet Union and numerous other countriesswiftly condemned the invasion, and a few, including the U.S.and France, froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets on theirterritory.   Mr. Hussein's actions smashed any traditional notion ofArab brotherhood governing politics in the region. His attackhumbled Egypt, which had sought a negotiated end to tensionsbetween Iraq and Kuwait, and threatened to push Syria closerto the moderate Arab camp. It left Saudi Arabia, with itsinfant military, particularly anxious about Mr. Hussein'sfurther designs.   &quot;I think he {Mr. Hussein} has finally convinced everyonethat he is incorrigible and a threat to regional peace,&quot; saysMichael Dewar, deputy director of the International Institutefor Strategic Studies in London.   Still, most notable in the events in the Mideast this weekis the influence -- or the lack thereof -- exercised by thesuperpowers.   No longer is there a predictable East-West world order toguide U.S. responses to world events. A new, more complicatedorder reigns. The inability of the Bush administration to domuch about the Iraqi invasion shows just how difficult andfrustrating it will be for the U.S. to control events.   &quot;We've ended the Cold War and we've now begun the new era,the war over resources,&quot; suggests Judith Kipper, an analystat the Brookings Institution. &quot;This is over money and oil.&quot;   There are few attractive American responses. The Americanmilitary presence in the region -- eight warships in thePersian Gulf and the aircraft carrier Independence and itscontingent in the distant Indian Ocean -- isn't an adequateforce to roll back Iraq's enormous, war-hardened army.   President Bush initially said that military interventionwasn't under consideration, though Kuwait had asked the U.S.to send troops. Later yesterday, he declined to rule variousoptions either in or out.   Even if the U.S. wanted to move to prevent Iraq's forcesfrom moving farther, into Saudi Arabia, the task would bedifficult. The U.S. would have to send a large chunk of itsEuropean-based ground forces and their support equipment tothe kingdom. That could take weeks and would require arequest from a Saudi government that wants Americanprotection but always has been reluctant to ask for itpublicly. President Bush and Saudi King Fahd talked by phonefor half an hour last night and discussed &quot;possible optionsfor dealing with the situation,&quot; the White House said.   &quot;In the past neither the Kuwaitis nor Saudis have beeninclined to allow American bases or forces on their soil,&quot;says former Energy and Defense Secretary James Schlesinger.&quot;I think that it would be desirable from a Saudi point ofview and an American point of view that there be an Americanpresence.&quot;   The U.S. also doesn't have attractive nonmilitary optionsfor stopping Iraq. President Bush yesterday banned mosttransactions with Iraq, which Treasury officials said includethe import of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The House ofRepresentatives voiced its support by voting to cut off alltrade with Iraq.   But a boycott by the U.S. alone will be meaningless. Iraqcan find other buyers for its oil. Only a boycott with wideinternational participation would be effective, and in thepast, such boycotts have collapsed because some countriesinevitably buy from -- or sell to -- the target country.   The Bush administration yesterday was contacting itsallies, urging them to emulate its economic sanctions againstIraq. But there were few signs that the State Department wasactively lobbying yet for an international embargo of Iraqiand Kuwaiti oil, which by some estimates could cause worldoil prices to double.   President Bush and British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher suggested at a joint press conference in Colorado,where they held a previously scheduled meeting, thatinternational restrictions on the purchase of Iraqi oil mightbe considered in the United Nations Security Council withindays. (The Council yesterday condemned the Iraqi invasion.)   This isn't the first time that a Third World conflict hasspun out of the reach of the superpowers, of course. ButIraq's move may signal that such uncontrollable crises willbecome more of a rule than an exception. Unlike at times inthe past, the U.S. and the Soviet Union can't negotiate overthe heads of their regional proxies to reach a settlement, asthey did in the 1973 Middle East war.   Rather, Iraq's Saddam Hussein represents precisely thekind of Third World leader -- independent-minded and armedfar beyond what would have seemed possible just a few yearsback -- who may pose the clearest threat to internationalstability in the 1990s. The shift in the longstanding worldorder may well embolden such leaders to act on their own tohelp shape the new global power structure. &quot;Without theEast-West alignments, countries feel freer to move,&quot; says Ms.Kipper.   As if to underscore the irrelevance of the superpowersduring events in the Mideast Thursday morning, the news ofIraq's invasion reached Secretary of State James Baker andSoviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze while they weremeeting in remote Siberia. Mr. Shevardnadze didn't know ofthe attack until Mr. Baker told him. Later, the Soviet Unionannounced it would cease arm sales to Iraq.   Another option under discussion last night would requirefar more than simple Soviet and American action. Officials ofseveral nations have discussed the possibility of stranglingIraqi oil sales by choking off export routes. That wouldrequire cutting off two large pipelines, one which runs fromIraq through Saudi Arabia, another that runs through Turkey.It would also require the U.S. Navy to block Iraqi shipmentsfrom the Persian Gulf.   Such a blockade might be feasible, some diplomats say, inlight of the widespread dissatisfaction with Iraq. But itwould call for strong political resolve from all sides,including the Arab League, which, as of late last night,hadn't taken a stand on the invasion despite Kuwait's demandthat it send an Arab liberation force. Many in the League,which has long been a disunified and ineffectiveorganization, fear Iraq's military might themselves. In fact,most Arab leaders, at least initially, failed to eithercondemn or condone the attack. Mr. Bush said he is beingcautioned to go slow by Arab leaders such as Egypt's HosniMubarak.   With no clear, practical steps to take, the U.S. and theSoviet Union resorted to dramatic political symbolism. Mr.Baker was flying to Moscow late yesterday to issue a jointstatement criticizing the invasion with Mr. Shevardnadze.   The Bush administration has known for more than a weekthat an Iraqi invasion was possible. Some members of Congresscriticized the White House for failing to head off the Iraqimove. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman ClaibornePell, for example, called Mr. Hussein &quot;the Adolf Hitler ofthe Middle East,&quot; and said if &quot;the administration had actedearlier, Hussein may have gotten the message that hislawlessness wouldn't be tolerated.&quot;   But the White House has been reluctant to mount apre-emptive move without an explicit request from the nationsinvolved. The best response the U.S. could muster was amodest, hastily assembled joint naval exercise with theUnited Arab Emirates. The Iraqis were evidently notimpressed.   &quot;We will turn Kuwait into a graveyard if any outside powerintervenes,&quot; Mr. Hussein said after claiming that Iraqitroops had entered Kuwait at the request of a revolutionarygroup that had overthrown the government. Asked for evidenceof this, Iraqi officials declined to comment.   Thursday's invasion gives back to Mr. Hussein two assetshe squandered in his eight-year war with Iran: oil wealth andaccess to the sea. By raising the price of oil and possiblysecuring some or all of Kuwait's vast fields he will be ableto free himself of a crippling war debt estimated at over $50billion.   That could free Mr. Hussein to pursue his grander regionalambitions. Among them: settling scores with Syria, andchampioning the cause of Palestinians, particularly inIsraeli-occupied lands. Earlier this year, fearing an Israelistrike against a vast military buildup that has made Iraq theworld's biggest arms buyer over the last five years, Mr.Hussein threatened to &quot;scorch half of Israel&quot; with chemicalweapons if it attacked him.   &quot;Israel is his target. He's preparing himself better,&quot;contends Ofra Benja, an Iraq specialist at the DayanInstitute in Tel Aviv. &quot;But the danger is there for everybody-- Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Syria.&quot;   Indeed, until two weeks ago, Kuwait seemed low on the listof Iraq's potential enemies. The emirate bankrolled Iraqthrough its war with Iran, lending between $10 billion and$20 billion, and pumped oil on Iraq's behalf. It also hasgenerously funded the Palestinian cause and is home to some300,000 Palestinian refugees.   But Iraq never accepted Kuwait's borders, opposing thestate's independence from Britain in 1961 and engaging inarmed clashes with it in 1973 and 1976. Resentment grew asKuwait, with only 750,000 nationals, became ever richer.   Explains a diplomat from a nearby Gulf emirate: &quot;Arabshave been asking why should a power like Iraq have to put upwith borders that were a colonial invention? It is possibleto see all these countries -- the United Arab Emirates,Bahrain, Qatar -- as imperialist creations that allow theWest to play one against the other in the interests of cheapoil.&quot;   In Iraq, Mr. Hussein was faced with a postwar economyravaged by 45% inflation, lack of foreign exchange andshortages of even the most basic foodstuffs. Mr. Hussein hadlittle experience as a peacetime manager: Since becomingpresident in 1979 he has been constantly at war, with Iran,his own Kurdish minority and, by proxy, with Syria inLebanon. Yet another campaign -- this time against weak,oil-rich neighbors -- must have seemed an easy way to divertattention from domestic ills.   Indirectly, the invasion of Kuwait also is a way for Mr.Hussein to thumb his nose at the small state's ally, America.The U.S. has disappointed Mr. Hussein by not pouring aid intohis country after the war. More important, Iraqi isolationhas been deepened by Western criticism of its brutal domesticpolicies and bully-boy tactics abroad. Last Saturday, in aninterview with this newspaper, an Iraqi diplomat threatened:&quot;If you want Saddam Hussein to invade Kuwait, just keep upthat boycott talk in the U.S.&quot;   Mr. Hussein has attacked a sophisticated city-state, inwhich even student leftists drive gold Mercedeses with carphones and &quot;I love democracy&quot; bumper stickers. Kuwait'scitizens enjoyed far more rights than Mr. Hussein's bitterlyrepressed population of 14 million. Kuwait's press is amongthe freest in the Arab world, and its well-educatedpopulation has been agitating for a more open politicalsystem, although calls for the overthrow of the al-Sabahfamily, which has ruled Kuwait since 1752, were extremelyrare.   Nevertheless, Iraq claimed it had come to the aid of&quot;youth in Kuwait&quot; to end &quot;the rule of corruption andterrorism exercised by the clique of the former government.&quot;Iraqi troops and tanks poured across the border Thursday in ablitzkreig assault as warplanes and helicopters bombedKuwait's airport and royal palaces. The surprise assault metsporadic resistance from the greatly outgunned Kuwaitiforces, an estimated 200 of whom were killed or wounded byThursday afternoon. Among the reported dead was one of thebrothers of the Kuwaiti emir. Others of the royal family arereported to have fled to safety in Saudi Arabia. The 3,000 to4,000 Americans living in Kuwait didn't appear to be indanger, although a few U.S. oil workers apparently were movedby Iraqi troops.   Kuwait's future remains unclear. Some 60% of Kuwait'spopulation is imported labor, principally from poorer Arabcountries and the Indian subcontinent. These people don'thave the vote or a large share in the state's wealth, andcould be manipulated by Iraqi largess to support a puppetgovernment. Kuwait's Shiite minority also may be won overwith promises of a greater share of power.   If Iraq stays in Kuwait, it will gain control of numerousoil refineries and almost 4,000 Kuwaiti service stations inEurope, which market gasoline under the Q8 brand. Iraq, untilnow, has had to stick to crude-oil production alone becauseit lacked the funds to buy such &quot;downstream&quot; facilitiesabroad. With its greater control over OPEC production undercurrent quotas, Iraq also would have a commanding say overoil pricing. And it will gain a new shipping channel. Iraq'sonly other outlet -- the Shatt al-Arab waterway -- is chokedwith sunken vessels from the Iran-Iraq war, and remains thesubject of a territorial dispute with Iran.   While Western countries condemn the invasion, and Arabdiplomats scramble to defuse tensions, Kuwaitis themselveswonder whether their country will ever be the same. &quot;He has agiant piggy bank in his hands. Why should he give it back?&quot;asks Naser al-Marri, an official with the Kuwaiti InvestmentAuthority, now working in London. &quot;He won't, unless the worldmakes him.&quot;   In the short term, then, it seems Mr. Hussein has gambledagain and won. But in the process, he has sown dangerousseeds of distrust and instability in the Arab world. Somepressure also may be off Israel's new right-wing government,which already is saying that Mr. Hussein's actions show thatIraq, not Israel, is the threat to stability in the region.Yesterday, Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens denouncedIraq's actions but said Israel planned no military response.He added that Kuwait's &quot;occupation by Iraq doesn't change ourstrategic situation.&quot;   If Mr. Hussein decides to remain in control of Kuwait, healso may find the citizens of that land less pliant thanthose in his own country. On Thursday, hundreds of anxiousKuwaitis stranded in London swarmed their country's embassy,waving posters of their deposed emir and shouting &quot;Kuwait isfor Kuwaitis]&quot; and &quot;Down with Saddam]&quot;   Khalid Juma, a 25-year-old law student in London for aone-month summer course, wondered if his chosen career madesense any more. &quot;The only law that matters now comes in atank,&quot; he said. &quot;I should be training for guerrilla warfare.&quot;   ---   Tony Horwitz in London contributed to this article.   ---               The Arsenals of the Two Nations                                                                                                        All figures are for 1988-89                                                                                                                          IRAQ'S MILITARY FORCES                                                                                                          Army                                                                                                        955,000                                                                                                          Tanks                                                                                                        2,500 Soviet T-54s 1,500 Soviet T-59s 1,000 Soviet T-62s approx. 500 Soviet T-72s 30 British Chieftains 100 light tanks (PT-76)                                                                                                          Combat Aircraft                                                                                                        16 Soviet bombers 4 Chinese bombers                                                                                                          Fighters                                                                                                        70 Soviet MiG-23s 30 Soviet Su-7s (Fitter A) 50 Soviet Su-20s (Fitter) 30 Soviet Su-25s (Frogfoot) 40 Chinese J-6s (MiG-19)                                                                                                          Helicopters                                                                                                        40 Soviet Mi-24s (Hind) 20 French SA-342s (Gazelle) 13 French SA-321s (Super Frelon) 30 French SA-316s (Alouette III) 56 French supplied Bo-105s                                                                                                                         KUWAIT'S MILITARY FORCES                                                                                                          Army 20,300                                                                                                          Tanks                                                                                                        40 British Centurions 165 British Chieftains 70 British Vickers Mk1s                                                                                                          Combat Aircraft                                                                                                        20 French Mirages 12 British Lightnings 4 British Hunters (in store) 24 American A-4Kus                                                                                                          Helicopters                                                                                                        12 French SA-342s (Gazelle) 6 French SA-332s (Super Puma)                                                                                                        Source: International Institute for Strategic Studies</TEXT></DOC>
