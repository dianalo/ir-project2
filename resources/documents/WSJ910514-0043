Mr. Bush's announcement significantly alters two U.S.positions at long-running negotiations aimed at producing aworldwide treaty to prohibit chemical arms. Officials saidthe president made the changes in hope of capitalizing on newconcern about chemical arms in the wake of the war againstIraq, during which there were fears such weapons would beused. While the president's decision may increase the chancesof enacting a global ban, it doesn't remove all obstaclesfacing such a treatyparticularly the reluctance of somesmaller countries to give up their chemical weapons.</LP><TEXT>   At the same time, administration officials said they arecontinuing to work on a related arms-control proposal torestrict weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. Thatproposal will include provisions for eliminating chemicalweapons in the region and will call for steps to stop theintroduction of new nuclear weapons without requiring Israelto give up its existing nuclear arms.   That would be achieved, officials said, by requiringIsrael to forgo acquiring new fissionable material that couldbe used to build additional nuclear weapons, while blockingArab nations from building nuclear arms. But the plan isstill under debate, and it isn't clear when it will be madepublic.   Until yesterday, the U.S. had been insisting that it wouldreserve the right to use chemical weapons to retaliate for achemical attack, and would keep 2% of its current chemicalweapons stockpile, as long as any nation capable of producingchemical arms hadn't signed the new treaty.   Now the Bush administration is effectively declaring thatit is willing to get out of the chemical weapons businessentirely, even if a country suspected of having chemical armsdoesn't sign the world-wide ban. The ban would go into effect10 years after completion of the treaty that is now beingnegotiated in Geneva.   U.S. officials acknowledged that they are shiftingpositions because the negotiations were being hindered by theU.S. insistence on retaining 2% of its stockpile and theright to retaliate. &quot;The 2% position was in fact widelyunpopular,&quot; a senior administration official said at a newsbriefing.   The Bush administration had calculated, officials said,that its earlier position would put pressure on other nationsto join an international chemical-weapons deal as a way offorcing the U.S. to give up its last 2% and its right to usechemical weapons in retaliation. But in fact, the U.S.insistence on a right to retain some arms had simply beenmaking other nations unwilling to agree to give up all oftheirs.   Mr. Bush also proposed that the 39 nations negotiating theprohibition on chemical arms set a goal of settling the bigissues in the talks by the end of this year and wrap up theentire treaty by the end of 1992.   The new U.S. positions are sure to raise questions aboutwhether the U.S. should disavow the use of chemical weaponsif some nations are suspected of keeping a stockpile of suchweapons or the ability to produce them.   To address those concerns, Mr. Bush suggested that thetreaty set up significant penalties to try to force nationssuspected of having chemical arms to sign the ban.Specifically, he suggested that countries signing the treatypledge to ban exports of &quot;chemical weapon-related materials&quot;to countries that don't sign.   U.S. officials said they hope such a provision could beapplied so broadly that it would ban sales of chemicals usedin everyday business activities, thereby creating asubstantial penalty for not signing the treaty.   &quot;These steps can move the world significantly closer tothe goal of a world free of chemical weapons,&quot; Mr. Bush saidin a statement released by the White House.   The treaty being negotiated in Geneva would be sweeping inscope. It would ban the production, possession, transfer anduse of chemical weapons. Mr. Bush has identified himselfclosely with the talks, and while he was vice president in1984 he presented the draft treaty that has been the basisfor much of the current negotiation.   Despite the changes proposed by Mr. Bush, there still maybe problems wrapping up the kind of comprehensive ban hewants. Many Third World nations, for instance, may bereluctant to accept a ban on chemical weapons as long as richand powerful nations such as the U.S. retain the right toproduce and stockpile nuclear weapons.</TEXT></DOC>
