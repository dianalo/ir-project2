Flooding elsewhere in Ohio left one childdead and hundreds out of their homes.   Police could not say how many people were in the cars, but allthe occupants were feared dead in Friday's accident. No bodies orcars had been recovered by early today.   ``The car in front of us just dropped straight down,'' saidSharon Boebinger, who was waiting to cross the bridge when itstarted collapsing. ``I said, `Oh my God.' I put it in reverse andbacked up. I didn't feel the bridge shake at all. It just happenedin an instant.''   Lt. Col. Ramon Hoffbauer of the Hamilton County sheriff's officewas asked if anyone could have survived the plunge.</TEXT><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain has been hit by a series of strikes inrecent months recalling the pre-Thatcher days of national walkoutsthat helped bring down a Labor Party government.   But experts say the scenario is very different from the ``Winterof Discontent'' of 1978-79 when public service workers paralyzedmuch of the country. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sConservative Party ousted the socialists in May 1979 on a wave ofanti-union sentiment.   Experts predict the strikes will eventually subside after acurrent round of wage negotiations. Although there are concerns thewalkouts could lead to higher wages and prices, their impact willbe limited by Mrs. Thatcher's union-curbing laws, they say.   Repeated one-day walkouts by subway workers and bus drivers haveforced millions of Londoners to walk to work. The BritishBroadcasting Corp. has canceled or cut live television and radioprograms because of brief strikes by employees for higher pay.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   There is a glimmer of hope as ATandamp;T and unionnegotiators race against a contract deadline at midnight tonight,but little progress is reported on the issue of health benefits,described by one source as ``the major block to a settlement.''   Both sides are expressing optimism at reaching new contractsbefore existing pacts affecting about 160,000 workers expire at11:59 p.m. EDT. But they say such a development hinges on a majorbreakthrough on the benefits package, which has dominated the talksfrom the outset.   ``If we can settle health care _ no easy task _ then we canreach agreement on wages and the other issues,'' a union sourcesaid late Friday. ``This is the major block to a settlement.''   Sources close to the negotiations said progress has been madebut they cautioned that negotiations are at a fragile stage andcould turn for the worse. In an arrangement likely to be repeatedtoday, formal negotiating committees met Friday at a Washingtonhotel while the two union presidents and ATandamp;T's top negotiator heldseparate meetings periodically on the major issues.</TEXT><DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citing concerns of residents fearful of crimeand addicts in their neighborhoods, former first lady Nancy Reaganjust said no to plans for a drug rehabilitation center that wouldbear her name.
