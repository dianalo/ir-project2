The Justice Department report by a committee from the Bureau ofPrisons and other agencies says the federal prisons had no plansfor dealing with total takeovers, and it recommends several changesin prison design and management.   The report to the House Judiciary Committee said that wardens atthe prisons in Atlanta, Ga., and Oakdale, La., failed to secure thefacilities partly because early signs of trouble were not relayedto them by prison personnel.   ``Of particular significance at both Oakdale and Atlanta wasinadequate communication among staff, the misinterpretation ofintelligence indicating potential unrest, and the fact thatimportant information never reached officials at appropriate levelsof authority,'' the report said.   The rioting was touched off by State Department announcement ofan agreement with Cuba that could have led to deportation of theinmates, who were prisoners and mental patients among 125,000Cubans sent to Florida in the 1980 Mariel boatlift.   The report blamed the State Department for giving prisonofficials only four hours' notice of their public announcement ofthe agreement.   The rioting, which lasted eight days at Oakdale and 11 days atAtlanta, included the taking of 138 prison employee hostages andresulted in the death of a detainee. The government estimated the1,394 inmates at Atlanta and 987 at Oakdale destroyed $64.4 millionin prison property and that it cost $48.9 million to quell thedisturbances and relocate the Cubans.   The report said the inmates showed ``a remarkably high degree oforganization after taking control of the institutions,''designating particular inmates as cooks, guards, unit managers andlieutenants and holding drills.   The report said emergency plans at both institutions failed toconsider the possibility of institution-wide disturbances, saying``takeovers as complete as those at Oakdale and Atlanta literallywere unimagined.''   The report listed 107 recommendations covering such areas asemergency management, hostage negotiations, equipment inventories,training, media relations and prison construction.   It recommended training to help better predict and avoid prisontrouble. Also, it said prisons should be designed so that foodstorage areas, records and utility controls are located outsideareas secured for the holding of inmates.</TEXT></DOC>
