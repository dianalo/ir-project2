ChipelloStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/24/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPAN TAXES </IN><DATELINE> TOKYO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Any chance that tax revision would become a tool to stimulate Japan's domestic economy all but vanished yesterday when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party decided to balance tax cuts with tax increases in the year beginning April 1.    &quot;Revenue neutrality&quot; has been a premise of the tax package since it was put forward by a government advisory council in October. But there had been pressure for allowing tax reductions to exceed increases in the first year of the new system in order to buoy the slumping economy.    Yesterday's decision by the ruling party indicates that the conservative Finance Ministry continues to have the final say in fiscal policy.    Tax reform was mentioned in an October memorandum between Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker as one of several steps Japan is taking to promote domestic growth. But some economists said they think the tax plan that is emerging could act as a drag on domestic spending.    &quot;It looks like in every face-down, the LDP has wilted in the face of&quot; the Finance Ministry, said Ron Napier, an economist who has monitored tax reform for Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd. in Tokyo. &quot;I frankly think this means Japan is going to underperform compared with its potential.&quot;    As previously reported, the LDP earlier this month approved a plan to implement in January 1988 a 5% value-added tax and, starting next October, a 20% tax on interest from previously tax-exempt savings accounts of three million yen or less, or about $18,500 at current exchange rates. The new levies are to be balanced by reductions in personal and corporate income tax rates.    Had the LDP chosen in subsequent deliberations to fully enact the income-tax cuts starting April 1, there could have been a net tax cut in the fiscal year of three trillion yen, or about $18.5 billion, about 0.9% of gross national product.    That would have been a substantial contribution to GNP growth, as most economists expect the output of goods and services to continue expanding at this year's historically low level of about 2%. More and more foreign exporters, particularly those in Asia such as South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore, are looking to Japan as a future source of growth and would welcome stimulative measures here.    Instead, the LDP, supported by the Finance Ministry, has decided to phase in the income-tax cuts gradually and to expand modestly some lesser levies to ensure that the reductions and increases balance next year. Some economists said there may be a brief spurt in spending late next year, before the value-added tax goes into effect. But such a spurt would be followed by a comparable slowdown after the tax takes effect, the economists said.    Among changes of potential interest to foreigners is a slight tightening of taxation of capital gains on securities transactions by individuals. Although most foreign investment in the Tokyo stock market is made by corporations, and thus wouldn't be directly affected, moves toward a broader capital-gains tax on individuals could sap some of the market's liquidity, according to Salomon's Mr. Napier.    The tax package still must go to the Diet, or Japanese parliament, early next year, where it is sure to run into a barrage of criticism from the opposition parties. Although the LDP's overwhelming majority makes passage nearly certain, the party will have to weather charges that it has effectively increased the tax burden on low-income individuals. Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone, in particular, will be criticized for backpedaling on a promise during last July's election campaign not to introduce a &quot;large-scale indirect tax.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
