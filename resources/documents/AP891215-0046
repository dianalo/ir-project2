Also today, the nation's leading cleric delivered an unusuallystrong attack on inefficiency and nepotism in the Aquinogovernment, which has been deeply shaken by the failed coup thatwas launched Dec. 1.   Prices tumbled in early trading on The Manila Stock Exchangeuntil the government's social security system and otherinstitutional investors intervened to prevent a feared collapse.   Traders attributed the panic selling to Thursday's grenadeattack on an American housing and recreational compound. There wereno injuries and minor damage. But the incident raised fears ofterrorism by remnants of military mutineers who tried to toppleMrs. Aquino.   The exchange's composite index of 25 selected issues plunged59.73 points to close at 1,002.81, down 5.62 percent fromThursday's finish. Before the rally, exchange President GerardoUrban warned the market was ``collapsing and it has lost itssanity.''   Business sources have expressed concern that the Aquinogovernment will be unable to cope with the economic, political andsocial effects of the failed coup.   In Davao, 560 miles south of here, Brig. Gen. Mariano Baccaysaid 500 Marines were flown to the city early today from Zamboangato secure the airport, banks and other key installations followingreports of rebel troop movements.   Baccay told reporters that an unknown number of rebels had lefttheir garrison, about 150 miles north of Davao, but it wasuncertain where they were heading. Roadblocks had been set up nearDavao, the largest city on Mindanao island.   On Thursday, Sen. Aquilino Pimentel, who comes from Mindanao,warned of a possible coup attempt on the island in the next twoweeks. Rodolfo Canieso, chief of the government intelligenceservice, told a Senate committee that rebels were planning a newstrike against the Aquino administration in the central Visayasislands and Mindanao.   Canieso, a retired major general and former army commander, said60 percent of the 160,000-member armed forces would accept whatevergovernment emerged victorious in a future coup.   In Manila, Cardinal Jaime L. Sin, Roman Catholic archbishop ofManila, called for stern punishment for mutineers but criticizedthe Aquino administration for its stewardship of the nation.   ``The perpetrators of the coup must definitely be hunted downand punished,'' Sin told a conference of Filipino ambassadors.``But beyond that, the presidency must be freed of every taint ofnepotism. The fruits of economic recovery must be distributed moreequitably.''   Sin has been among Mrs. Aquino's most outspoken supporters sincethe 1986 ``people power'' uprising, when he called hundreds ofthousands into the streets to join the revolution that toppled thelate President Ferdinand Marcos and put Mrs. Aquino in power.   During the speech, Sin said the country appeared quiet for themoment ``like the silence in the eye of a typhoon.''   ``Unsettling is the actual inefficiency in many branches ofgovernment,'' Sin said. ``Unsettling are the unceasing reports ofthe undue influence of presidential relatives in officialgovernment policy. ...Unsettling is the omnipresence still of somuch poverty, so much suffering in our country.''   No group claimed responsibility for the grenade attack on theU.S. Seafront compound. But Brig. Gen. Alexander Aguirre, chief ofthe police Capital Command, said the attackers could have beenrebel soldiers angry at U.S. support for Mrs. Aquino.   The incident followed threats against U.S. interests by rebelsoldiers after U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for governmentforces during the coup attempt, which ended Saturday. At least 113people were killed in the eight-day coup.   Half of the estimated 3,000 troops who took part in the coupattempt, the sixth and most serious insurrection of Mrs. Aquino'sregime.</TEXT></DOC>
