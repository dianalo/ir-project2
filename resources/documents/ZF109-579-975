(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LANDraftersandM;Designing a broadband network is not an easy undertaking, whether you are inthe Fortune 500, a major university, a large government facility, or with acable design contractor.andP;  A good cable design program, however, can prove aninvaluable tool.andP;  It can eliminate tedious calculations, check rules, andother consistent system designs.andM;Computer-aided design (CAD) software enables broadband systems to be designedmore easily and accurately.andP;  Cable designs are math-intensive and complex.andO;Issues of powering, distortions, noise calculations, and insertion lossesmust be considered.andM;Although broadband design software has been around for a number of years,many designers, broadband LAN technicians, and systems integrators remainfaithful to their calculators or simple BASIC PC programs.andM;A cable design program can improve productivity a thousandfold, when comparedto a calculator.andP;  This factor improves dramatically if the design programalso calculates powering and distortion in real-time within the design.andP;  Butno cable program automatically designs a cable system for you.andP;  They simplytake over repetitive calculations.andM;CAD Drafting SoftwareandM;A good selection of affordable CAD programs are available, includingAutodesk's AutoCAD and Generic CADD, Priam Computer's VersaCAD, Cadkey'sCadkey, Intergraf's Microstation, American Small Business' DesignCAD,Evolution Software's EasyCAD, Foresight Resources' Drafix, and Isicad'sCadvance.andP;  AutoCAD commands about a 70 percent penetration of the mechanicaland architectural users, according to the Anderson Report, a newsletter fromAnderson Publishing (Simi Valley, Calif.).andP;  AutoCAD is followed by VersaCADat 8.6 percent, CADKEY at 5.8 percent, Generic CADD at 4.7 percent,Microstation at 2.6 percent, EasyCAD at 1.0 percent, and Drafix at 0.8percent.andM;All drafting software offers 2-D drawing capabilities, which is sufficientfor all LAN design needs.andP;  LAN drafting consists of lines, curves, arcs,circles, and text, not 3-D features, such as wire molds, surfing, or solidrendering.andM;CAD drafting software can set a drawing scale of any ratio, especially 1:100or 1:200.andP;  Drawing limits can be defined for any drawing size.andP;  The &quot;D&quot; size(24-inch X 36-inch) drawing is popular for broadband system designdocumentation.andM;You should be able to create cable device symbols as &quot;write blocks&quot; orcomposite drawings so you can easily insert complex drawing symbols at anylocation by a call from your tablet menu.andP;  If write blocks are not supported,you will have to repetitiously draw a device and its configuration.andM;The LAN design can be layered.andP;  Streets can be drawn on a layer called&quot;streets,&quot; poles and stands drawn on a layer called &quot;stands,&quot; a 3/4-inchtrunk on a layer called &quot;trunks,&quot; and buildings on a &quot;buildings&quot; layer.andP;  Youshould be able to creat each layer in a different color.andP;  Layering allows youto design on a specific layer, while other layers are frozen, or invisible.andO;With some layers turned off, screen regeneration is faster.andM;A CAD drawing should be easy to plot.andP;  Pen plotting takes time, depending onthe drawing density.andP;  The PC, and consequently the designer, is tied up untilthe plot is finished.andP;  A quick cure is to use a plotter memeory bufferavailable through third-party companies.andP;  Another solution is to print thedrawing on a laser printer before plotting.andP;  A laser printer gives you adraft on which you can make corrections before doing a final plot.andM;CAD drafting software should import or export drawing files to other softwarebrands.andP;  This is usually done by converting a file to a DXF file.andM;Finding A Good CADandM;1.andP;  Is the screen interface intuitive to the user?andP;  The way the screeninformation is presented determines how well you're going to get along withthe program.andP;  A cryptic screen makes the software of little use, no matterhow powerful the program is.andP;  Some program screens may have a spreadsheetappearance and require a lot of code that you have to interpret to explainthe design to someone.andM;A user interface should have organized windowed locations for design entries,level analysis, and current status.andP;  Additional information should beavailable through dialogue boxes.andP;  Pull-down menus are also desirable.andM;2.andP;  What is the design frequency range?andP;  There is little value in buying aprogram that allows an upper design frequency of 600MHz, only to discoverthat you now have to upgrade to a 1GHz system.andP;  Some programs can design upto 2GHz with user-defined frequency splits.andM;You should be able to design the reverse frequency simultaneously, even indual-calbe broadband systems.andP;  You should be able to take an existing forwardfrequency design file and perform reverse design without reentering the data.andO;Avoid programs that allocated choices of fixed frequencies.andM;3.andP;  Can frequencies be changed in the middle to the design?andP;  The ability tochange frequencies in mid-design is important whe rebuilding applications ordoing what-if scenarios.andP;  If you did a 300MHz design, will the software letyou easily change to 450MHz or 550MHz and do a global recalculation?andP;  Somesoftware requires you to change cable insertion losses for the higherfrequency, although you will still see the old frequency on the screen.andM;4.andP;  Can trunk and feeder designs be linked together?andP;  Some programs use onemenu to run an individual module for trunk design and another menu for feederto tap distribution.andP;  These menus are not necessarily inter-active, and trunkand feeder designs must be done independently of each other.andP;  In this type ofprogram, you must design the trunk, save the drawing to a file, exit thetrunk module, and enter the feeder module.andP;  You then begin with a bridger's(or trunk amplifier's) output level, enter a feeder-maker (some force you touse line splitters or directional couplers), then add the cable and taps.andO;You must save the bridger/feeder distribution as another file.andM;Look for a design program that can design trunk and feeder within the samemodule, as well as switch from trunk to bridger distribution using a simplecommand.andM;5.andP;  Can the program do AC powering within the design?andP;  When a amplifiersbegan using switching-power supplies, calculating AC powering receivedgreater attention in the design process.andP;  When an amplifier power supplyreceives a lower voltage, it wants more current to maintain its regulation.andO;The problem occurs when the AC voltage is lowered, the power supply wantsmore current.andP;  There is then a corresponding increase in current across thecable span ahead, causing a higher IR voltage input.andP;  further decreasing thevoltage input.andM;The design software should be able to calculate true AC powering in the abovescenario.andP;  It should be able to calculate AC powering within the design.andP;  Itshould permit you to move the power inserter to optimize powering.andP;  Whendesigning a system with interdiction, AC powering is an important part of thefeeder design element.andP;  Interdiction is a method of making taps addressableto increase security and management control.andP;  Instead of a technician havingto disable a tap physically, she can turn it off remotely while sitting in acentral location.andM;Programs that cannot link trunk to feeder within the design cannot calculatepowering in real-time.andP;  To overcome this, some programs offer a poweringutility program to recreate the cable layout per power supply.andP;  So to do ACpowering, you must enter same cable footages all over again.andM;6.andP;  Does the program offer noise and distortion calculations?andP;  Distortionsand carrier-to-noise ratio (C/N) calculations are often done with BASICprograms.andP;  If you have mized amplifiers and levels, these programs are notlimited use.andP;  In the past, distortion calculations usually ran on thedesigner's intuition and a factor of safety was ensured if you didn't exceedthe cascade length.andM;The IEEE 802.7 broadband LAN standard sets strict specification fordistortions and noise.andP;  System certification is best served by havingdistortion and noise calculations for the LAN engineer to obserbe andcompare.andP;  Furthermore, it makes for good system design documentation.andM;A program should be able to calculate C/N, second-order noise, crossmodulation, and composite triple beat, in real-time.andP;  For example, after anamplifier is added, you should be able to observe the C/N and distortions viaa dialogue box.andM;With amplifiers using switch-regulated power supplies, hum is no longer anissue, except if the passive device's current rating is exceeded.andP;  A designprogram may offer interstage padding, which allows you to optimize the C/N bythe bst input into the amplifier.andP;  This trades input padding for theinterstage and improves C/N calculations, but be sure that the program takesinto effect rises in distortion when overloading the pre-amp input.andM;7.andP;  Are in-line equalizers automatically placed?andP;  If the program offers thisfeature, make sure you can override it.andP;  A good designer must control thedesign.andP;  The computer should not control the design.andM;At first glance, automatically placing in-line equalizers seems necessary,but the computer can make poor design decisions.andP;  The software oftenautomatically places equalizers preceding the cable feeding into the tap,rather than adjacent to the tap's input, where they should be.andM;The software should warn you when you've exceeded the cable spacing ormaximum tilt.andP;  When the warning occurs, backng up to the previous entry tocorrect the problem is easy.andM;8.andP;  Does the program automatically insert amplifiers?andP;  As with automaticallyplacing equalizers, problems occur when trusting a design program to placeamplifiers automatically.andP;  This is true for feeder distribution, where thistype of program automatically inserts an amplifier adjacent to a tap'sthroughport, rather than at its input.andP;  In a good design, a tap does notprecede an amplifier's input, since this may result in lower than expectedC/N ratios, which is especially noticeable at the end of the longestcascades.andM;Another problem arises when the program selects a pole span interval that iscrowded or is not easily accessible.andP;  (A pole span interval is a commonmeasure of cable distance.andP;  Within buildings, cables are measured from hangarto hangar.)andP;  If cable distances are known while designing, the automaticselection can be disabled.andM;Eventually, automatic functions may hinder design productivity.andP;  But in thebeginning, these features may be good for novice designers who don't know allthe intricacy of RF broadband design, and the program is both a designer andteacher.andP;  This backward approach to good design practice indicates thatpersonalized training should be reinforced.andM;9.andP;  Does the software show true equalizer and pad values?andP;  A design packagethat only gives you the difference between the maximum edges of thebandwidth, or band-edge tilt compensation, is of little value.andP;  The amplifierequalizer should be calculated as if it were cable and it should be a truevalue.andP;  Also, look for a program that gives interstage pad options.andM;10.andP;  Does the software use feeder-makers?andP;  Many programs require that you usestandard line splitters and directional coupler passives for bridgerfeeder-makers.andP;  Most the passives exert higher insertion losses thanfeeder-makers, and the resulting RF levels are lower than expected.andP;  Buildinga feeder-maker using this process does not issue a correct bill of materialsreport.andP;  Look for software that specifically addresses user definedfeeder-maker configurations.andM;11.andP;  Are RF levels displayed in real time?andP;  The software should keep updatesonscreen on the current levels at all band edges, tilt deviation, andaccumulated losses from the last amplifier or starting point.andP;  Current systemlevel analysis should always be displayed and updated automatically asdevices are added or as you browse the design.andP;  Although you are designing ina forward direction, you must be constantly aware of the system levels andstatus.andM;12.andP;  Does the program design in the reverse direction?andP;  Some programs operateperform the calculations after you have entered a series of devices.andP;  In thiscase, you design your tap distribution (cable, tap, cable, tap, passive,etc.) first.andP;  From the end of line, the software calculates the design to itsbridger or line extender.andP;  You get the program's design interpretation.andP;  Ifyou don't like what the software designed, you can override it and redesignyourself.andP;  These programs don't offer realtime signal analysis, because truelevels can't be known until after the calculations are completed.andP;  The notionthat reverse designing optimizes amplifier placement is moot if a program hasreal-time RF level analysis for forward and reverse frequencies.andM;13.andP;  Does the software allow design to continue after a terminating tap?andO;Some programs don't permit you to continue to design after a terminated tapuntil an amplifier is inserted ahead of the terminated tap.andP;  A design programshould permit you to continue designing, allowing you to enter as manydevices as needed until the last user is reached (although the devices have azero port and value).andP;  Then the software should let you go back and inseert adistribution amplifier.andP;  Following the amplifier insertion, the programshould recalculate the zeroed taps for their design values.andM;Similarly, the design software should allow you to enter any device even ifyou are violating spacing, tilt, or RF levels.andP;  You should be able to takecorrective action without being restricted to design protocols.andM;Tapping InandM;14.andP;  Can you assign hot taps?andP;  Although most programs provide hot tapassignment, you should ensure that they can be device-locked so they won'tchange to a new value if input levels change.andP;  Also, you should change thevalue of any tap by changing the output level, rather than by replacing thetap with a new value.andM;15.andP;  Can you device-lock design entries?andP;  The design software should keepselected devices from recalculating.andP;  Device-lokcing is particularlyimportant for hot taps.andP;  You can device-lock all taps in a feeder branch,then see the drop level effects when upgrading to a higher frequency.andP;  Whendevice-locking an amplifier, the pads and equalizers are frozen despite thechanging of frequencies, temperature, or input levels.andM;16.andP;  How does the software determine tap values?andP;  Tap values should beselected according to tap port or cable drop output specifications, which arebased on a specified cable lenght and any cable size.andP;  Ensure that you canspecify the minimum RF drop band edge levels.andP;  Also, look for a program thatcan easily display the forward and reverse frequency levels and loop loss fordual-cable broadband.andP;  Entering complex programming codes should not benecessary.andP;  You should be able to change the tap value by specifying anotherport or drop output level.andM;17.andP;  Can you define in the database the number of ports on a tap?andP;  Someprograms are limited to two, four, and eight ports.andP;  Look for software thatoffers user-defined taps from one to 99 ports.andP;  You should be able to defineup to 20 frequency insertion points across the bandwidth.andP;  A program shouldbe able to use tap values in tenths of a decibal for the 1.5 incremental tapvalues.andM;18.andP;  Can you define insertion loss points for passive components, equalizers,and pads?andP;  The program's database passive editor should allow you to defineyour choice of 10 to 20 frequency insertion loss points, so you can definespecial insertion loss values for sub-, mid-, and high-split components.andO;This also allows you to define any special equalizer or pad type for aspecific in-line application.andM;19.andP;  Can the database be modified while in the design?andP;  In the middle of adesign, you may want to modify or create a new component in the database filefor your next device entry.andP;  Look for design software that can access thedatabase files from within the design using hotkeys or pull-down menus.andO;After creating or modifying the device, you should have immediate access toit.andM;Flexibility IssuesandM;20.andP;  Can you specify different design temperatures?andP;  RF cable designs arebased at 680 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature at which cable manufacturersspecify the losses.andP;  Strive to design for the annual median temperature.andM;Specifying a broadband network at different temperatures is useful for thosedesign in areas of extreme temperatures.andP;  It also serves as a what-ifscenario for getting accurate amplifier input levels at differenttemperatures, especially in long cable spans.andP;  If you change your designtemperature to -200 degrees Fahrenheit, you should see the tap values changedby the recalculation and restored when you return to a normal temperature.andM;21.andP;  Can the software design in metric?andP;  This option is crucial forinternational users and companies.andP;  Designs should automatically convertmetric to English and vice versa without the user having to reenter data.andM;22.andP;  How easily can you edit devices?andP;  Can you change the cable length, size,type, or manufacturer without having to delete the device in the design?andP;  Canyou change a two-way splitter to a three-way unbalanced splitter, then changeport assignments to alternate branches?andP;  Can you move a directional couplerand its down leg componets to another location, then have the tapsautomatically recalculate for updated values?andP;  Can you tweak the amplifier'soutput levels?andP;  Can you change an amplifier to another manufacturer's type?andM;Since you will spend time optimizing your design, look for a program thatgives you the flexibility to make changes as necessary.andM;23.andP;  Can you design with products from multiple manufacturers?andP;  BroadbandLANs almost always include a variety of cable types.andP;  Not every company makesa three-way balanced splitter or a directional coupler with 20 decibals ofattenuation.andP;  You may have to use different brands or special types ofamplifiers.andP;  Design software should give you the opportunity to select thedevice type you want before placing it into the design as well as substitutebrands.andM;24.andP;  Can you easily mix amplifiers of different gains?andP;  When rebuilding asystem, mixing amplifiers, of different gains is an important consideration.andO;Some systems use a mix of standard and power doubling or feed-forwardamplifiers.andP;  You should be able to select or switch between amplifiers ofdifferent gains.andP;  The more arduous the task, the more prone to errors.andM;25.andP;  Can you specify a derated amplifier?andP;  Specifying a line distribution,also known as a derated, amplifier should not be hard.andP;  You should at leasthave one selectable derated level for a cascaded, high-gain distributionamplifier.andP;  If you need additional levels, you should be able to change theamplifier output levels for a higher deration order.andM;Editors and ExtrasandM;26.andP;  Can you add descriptive text notations?andP;  You should be able to add andedit notations to the entered device.andP;  Can you describe a device with textualinformation such as user name, room number, and tap of amplifier number?andM;27.andP;  Can you seach the database?andP;  Designs get quite large and branch in everydirection.andP;  Finding a particular amplifier of point can be time-consuming andfrustrating.andP;  A design program should have a search feature that looks for atext string.andP;  The design package should offer a total count of deviceoccurrences.andM;28.andP;  What kind of reports does the design software generate?andP;  A designprogram should generate a bill of materials, outlining materials, net andlist costs, cost per mile, and usage per mile.andP;  You should be able to formatthe report in the order you wish to print it.andP;  It should be able to print apartial design bill of materials, such as a new extension.andP;  The bill ofmaterials should tell you the type and estimated number of cable connectorsand splice blocks used.andP;  Splice blocks should be specified only whendissimilar cables are joined.andM;A good design package should print a signal analysis.andP;  It should let you tochoose design parameters or device types you want, as well as print RFlevels, pad and equalizer values, distortion, AC powering, and cable type andfootages.andP;  A device connectivity report is important if you want to find howdevices are connected to other components.andM;Most programs will print an ASCII file to disk.andP;  A good program allows you towrite your printer driver, if you have you printer book.andM;29.andP;  What is the copy-protection scheme?andP;  Expect some copy protection.andP;  Ofthe two types--hardware lock and software encryption--a hardware lock isbetter.andP;  With a hardware lock, you can make disk backups as necessary, butonly operate the program using a hardware key attached to a printer port.andO;Software protection does not allow you to make backups.andP;  If the disk crashesor you reformat it without first uninstalling the software, the program isgone.andM;30.andP;  Can the program link to CAD drafting software?andP;  Few cable designprograms can link to drafting software, and those that can, will link toAuto-CAD.andP;  This link is facilitated by a translator program that runs withinthe CAD software.andP;  The translator interprets the cable design files andbuilds a symbol script file, which is compared to a symbol table file.andP;  Thesymbol script file knows the order of designed devices, and the operator onlyhas to paste the design symbols over the building drawing.andP;  A CAD translatorshould be easy to use, and you should be able to create your own cable designsymbols.andM;31.andP;  Does the CAD vendor offer a demo disk?andP;  Demo disks are generally asimple slideshow of the program screens along with some animatedexplanations.andP;  Other vendors may offer a working trial version that haslimited design entries and functionality, which gives you a good feel of mostof the program's aspects.andP;  A working trial disk is usually sold for a nominalfee.andP;  Simple demo disks should always be given away at no charge.andP;  Forvendors that don't have a demo disk, you'll have to arrange for a fulldemonstration at your facility, their office, or a trade show.andM;One of the best ways to evaluate a program is talk with people who use it.andO;Ask the vendor for references and call them.andP;  They may have evaluated most ofthe packages you are considering and may pass along some insight.andM;32.andP;  Are cable design features purchased separately?andP;  As a caveat, expect acable design program to feature full design capabilities including ACpowering, distortions, bill of materials, and complete signal analysisprintouts for one complete price, except for linking the design to CADsoftware.andP;  Some cable design programs are sold for a basic price, but if youneed to do AC powering, distortion analysis, etc., expect to pay more foreach additional feature.andM;PC-based broadband cable design software has become sophisticated andmeritorious for design productivity.andP;  However, the managerial and technicalissues of CAD are far-reaching and complex, and no single answer exists.andP;  Buta decision must be made in this world of fast-moving technology--and thedecision may be yours.andM;Selecting Your HardwareandM;Buy the fastest PC you can afford.andP;  Computer-aided design (CAD) softwarevendors recommend fast 80386s with at least 4MB of RAM.andP;  A 386SX is notrecommended for CAD, because its throughput isn't any faster than a 16MHz80286.andP;  The PC needs a math coprocessor chip.andP;  A 110MB hard drive is aminimum.andP;  If you plan to store hundreds of maps, you'll need a highercapacity magnetic or optical drive.andP;  A tape backup is optional.andM;If you only want to do cable design, but not CAD, the PC requirements areless stringest.andP;  Still, programs that offer unique features will bemath-intensive and will operate best on a 386.andP;  A math chip, if the softwareuses it, can cut recalculation time by more than 300 percent.andM;Invest in a high-resolution monitor.andP;  You can get by with a 14-inch colormonitor with 640 X 480 resolution.andP;  Super VGA monitors with 1024 X 768resolution are preferred.andP;  High resolution is best appreciated on at least a19-inch monitor.andM;Buy a mouse.andP;  Design is much easier with a mouse.andM;Use a laser printer.andP;  Depending on the drawing density, plotting can take along time, tying up both the designer and the PC.andP;  Before doing a final plot,do a standard printout on a laser printer.andP;  You should have at least 2MB ofprinter memory to support 300 dots-per-inch CAD drafting prints.andM;Buy a plotter.andP;  You'll need at least &quot;D-sized&quot; (24-inch X 36-inch) penplotter to print design maps.andP;  If you plan to plot a lot of maps in theshortest amount of time, you may want an electrostatic plotter.andM;Consider a digitizing table.andP;  The first concern when installing a LAN CADworkstation is getting existing design maps into the system.andP;  A digitizingtable can be used.andP;  The map is placed on a digitizing table, and a pointer isused to trace the design's bluelines into the computer.andP;  An &quot;E-sized&quot;(36-inch X 48-2nch) table is recommended.andM;Consider a map scanner.andP;  Using a digitizing table is slow.andP;  If you plan todigitize more than 500 maps, consider a map scanner.andP;  It will scan andconvert the design maps into a DXB of DXF files, which can be used by majorCAD drafting programs.andP;  A 12-inch X 12-inch tablet is recommended for usingcustomized user commands that can be invoked from the digitizing tablet whenno one is using the table.andM;Unfortunately, with map scanning you don't get an intelligent map to run abill of materials, but the map is at the original scale, and the street andbuilding layout, poles, addressing, and notes are there.andP;  If you don't wantto invest in a scanner, a mapping service company will convert your maps forabout $100 each.andM;John Gutierrez is president of Com-Net, a broadband systes design andconsulting firm headquartered in Austin, Texas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
