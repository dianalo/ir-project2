The survey of 745 delegates found that eight in 10 Dukakis delegates believe that the Massachusetts governor has treated Mr. Jackson favorably, but only one in 10 Jackson delegates agrees with them.    Nonetheless, the survey doesn't indicate any burning desire by Jackson forces for an acrimonious convention. The poll found that Mr. Jackson's backers are nearly evenly split on the question of whether his minority platform planks should be taken to the convention floor or resolved in negotiations. Seven in 10 Dukakis backers want to resolve the issues through negotiations.    According to the survey, 56% of Mr. Jackson's backers have a favorable opinion of Mr. Dukakis, twice as many as have an unfavorable view of him. Nearly eight of 10 Dukakis delegates have a favorable view of Mr. Jackson.    Texas Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, Mr. Dukakis's designated vice presidential running mate, is broadly popular with the governor's delegates -- nine in 10 have a favorable view of him and think he will help the ticket in November. By contrast, many of Mr. Jackson's supporters haven't yet formed opinions of him. About one in three has a favorable opinion, three in 10 have an unfavorable view, and the rest aren't sure. </TEXT></DOC>
