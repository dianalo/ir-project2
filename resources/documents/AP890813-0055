And that project was approved by a senior official in March onhis last workday at the agency after he waived numerous HUDregulations, The Sun reported Sunday.   The consulting fees appear to be the largest yet uncovered inprograms operated by the troubled federal housing agency, which hasbeen rocked by disclosures of favoritism and irregularities in manyprograms.   The Sun reported that Land Development Financing, led by CurtisJ. Mimna and his associate, Terry T. Mooney, stood to gain up to$4.9 million in consulting fees on projects under the Title X landdevelopment program until HUD Secretary Jack F. Kemp announced thathe was halting the program in late June.   Under Title X, a developer acquires land, builds roads andinstalls utilities on parcels of land that are then sold tobuilders who construct houses and apartments. If a project fails _and about half of all Title X projects have, according to HUDofficials _ HUD pays the mortgage lender the balance due on theloan.   Kemp said he would end the program because it was costly totaxpayers and had not helped provide adequate housing for the poor.   The largest Title X loan ever approved by HUD, for $78.2million, was granted March 3 to McNair Farms, a proposeddevelopment in Fairfax County, Va. Mimna's LDF received a $1.5million consulting fee for obtaining the HUD-backed mortgage, thenewspaper reported.   The loan was approved by James C. Nistler, deputy assistantsecretary of HUD for single-family housing, on his last day at theagency. HUD documents indicate that Nistler intervened personallyin the processing of the application, issuing a series ofdirectives to expedite the project and waive regular HUD procedures.   Mimna's brother, Michael, said his brother left the Washingtonarea several months ago and that he did not know how to reach him.   The documents reveal numerous apparent deviations from normalHUD procedures in the handling of McNair Farms.   _Normally, independent cost figures computed by HUD staff areused to determine how much a mortgage should be. But in the case ofMcNair Farms, the developer's own cost figures were used.   _The mortgage amount approved was $2 million more than the costs.   _A full environmental impact statement was not done, despiteenvironmental concerns about wetlands and flood plains on theproperty.   _Some of the mortgage proceeds were permitted to be used to payoff debts on land that was not covered by the Title X loan.   _Detailed working drawings and specifications, normally requiredbefore approval, were not submitted.   According to the documents, the project was approved afternumerous meetings involving Nistler, Mimna and Tricia Canzeri,whose husband, Joe, was briefly a special assistant to PresidentReagan. Canzeri also was a top adviser to Vice President DanQuayle's campaign, and organized an inaugural gala for PresidentBush.   James L. Clouser, executive vice president of Merrill Lynch MSB,a New York-based lending affiliate of the national brokerage firmthat provided the mortgage on McNair, said Mimna told him severalmonths ago that he had made Mrs. Canzeri a partner in hisconsulting firm while seeking approval of the McNair project.</TEXT></DOC>
