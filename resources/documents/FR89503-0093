Theestimated weighted-average margins are shown in the ``Suspension of Liquidation''section of this notice. We also determine that critical circumstances donot exist with respect to imports of AFBs from Romania, as outlined inthe ``Critical Circumstances'' section of this notice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Case History </ITAG>Since the notice of preliminary determinations (53 FR 45324, November 9,1988), the following events have occurred. Respondent and the petitionerrequested that the final determinations in all of the antidumping dutyinvestigations be postponed until not later than 135 days after the dateof publication of the preliminary determinations, pursuant to section 735(a)(2)of the Act. On December 2, 1988, we issued a notice postponing our finaldeterminations until not later than March 24, 1989 (53 FR 49581, December8, 1988). That notice also announced the scheduling of the public hearingin these investigations. Verification of the questionnaire responses was conducted in Romania duringDecember 1988. A public hearing was held on February 9, 1989. Petitionerand respondent have filed pre- and post-hearing briefs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigations </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the <T3>Harmonized Tariff Schedule </T3>(HTS), and all merchandise enteredor withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s). TheDepartment is providing both the appropriate <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated </T3>(TSUSA) item number(s)and the appropriate HTS item number(s) with its product descriptions forconvenience and Customs purposes. The Department's written descriptionof the products under investigation remains dispositive as to the scopeof the products covered by these investigations. These determinations cover ball bearings, mounted or unmounted, and partsthereof (ball bearings); and spherical roller bearings, mounted or unmounted,and parts thereof (spherical roller bearings). For a complete descriptionof these products, see Appendix A to the ``Final Determinations of Salesat Less Than Fair Value: Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered RollerBearings) and Parts Thereof from the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafterreferred to as Appendix A) which is published in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. <ITAG tagnum="84">Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG>Subsequent to the initiation of these investigations, the Department determinedthat the products under investigation constituted five separate classesor kinds of merchandise. After consideration of all comments, arguments,and information submitted by the parties, we find no reason to alter thatdecision. For a full discussion of our position on class or kind of merchandise,see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Standing </ITAG>We determine that petitioner has standing with respect to each of the fiveclasses or kinds of merchandise described in Appendix A. For a full discussionof standing see Appendix B which is referred to below. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Issues </ITAG>Appendix B to the ``Final Determinations of Sales at Less Than Fair Value:Antifriction Bearings (Other Than Tapered Roller Bearings) and Parts Thereoffrom the Federal Republic of Germany'' (hereinafter referred to as AppendixB) contains detailed discussions of all issues timely raised by partiesto the proceeding in each of the concurrent antidumping duty investigationsinvolving AFBs from nine countries. The first part of that Appendix addressesall general issues raised during these investigations and our treatmentof these topics. The general issues discussed therein are listed below:<ITAG tagnum="15">1. Class or Kind of Merchandise </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">2. Standing </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">3. Products Covered </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">4. Basis for Costs of Production </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">5. Market Viability </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">6. Alternative Requirements </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">7. Critical Circumstances </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">8. Administrative Protective Order Issues.</ITAG>Following the discussion of general issues, all remaining comments areaddressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Period of Investigation </ITAG>The period of investigation (POI) is October 1, 1987 through March 31,1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparisons </ITAG>To determine whether sales of certain AFBs from Romania to the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States priceto the foreign market value as specified in the ``United States Price''and ``Foreign Market Value'' sections of this notice. Petitioner alleged that Romania is a state-controlled economy country andthat sales of the subject merchandise in that country do not permit a determinationof foreign market value under section 773(a) of the Act. Our analysis ofissues relating to our determination that Romania is a state-controlled-economycountry and our selection of surrogate countries are discussed in the noticeof preliminary determinations. <ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price </ITAG>All sales from Tehnoimportexport (TIE) were made directly to unrelatedparties prior to importation into the United States. Therefore, we basedthe United States price on purchase price in accordance with section 772(b)of the Act. The calculations of United States price for ball bearings and sphericalroller bearings are detailed below.I. Ball Bearings We calculated the purchase price for ball bearings based on the f.o.b.price to unrelated purchasers. We made deductions from purchase price,where appropriate, for foreign inland freight in accordance with section772(d)(2) of the Act. Inland freight expenses were based on prices fromPortugal, the surrogate country chosen for purposes of these final investigations(<T3>see </T3>Foreign Market Value section of this notice). This actionis consistent with our practice that inland freight incurred in a state-controlledeconomy should be based on similar charges in a non-state-controlled economy.<T3>See, Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value: Carbon SteelWire Rod From Poland </T3>(49 FR 29434, July 20, 1984) and <T3>Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value Tapered RollerBearings and Parts Thereof, Finished or Unfinished, From the SocialistRepublic of Romania (TRBs), </T3>(52 FR 17433, May 8, 1987). The distancesfrom factory to port and the weight of an average container of AFBs usedin this calculation were based on verified information from Romania. II. Spherical Roller Bearings We calculated the purchase price for spherical roller bearings based onthe f.o.b. price to unrelated purchasers. The adjustment was identicalto that described above for ball bearings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>As a result of our determination that Romania has a state-controlled economy(<T3>see </T3>``Fair Value Comparison'' section of this notice), section773(c) of the Act requires us to use prices or the constructed value of``such or similar merchandise in a non-state-controlled economy country.''(<T3>See, </T3>Notice of Preliminary Determinations.) The calculations offoreign market value for ball bearings and spherical roller bearings aredetailed below. I. Ball Bearings We used the factors of production valued in a comparable economy, <T3>i.e., </T3>Portugal, as the basis of foreign market value, as providedfor in 19 CFR 353.8(c). We calculated constructed value based on the factorsof production reported by the four factories in Romania producing the subjectmerchandise. The information submitted by the Brasov and Birlad factorieswas verified. The weighted average of the adjustments resulting from verificationof those factories was applied to the data of the Ploiesti and Alexandriafactories. We have made the following changes to the reported factors:andbullet; Gross weight amounts were used to determine the material input,instead of net weights which were used in the response; andbullet; Some steel input factors of the Birlad and Alexandria factorieswere adjusted to reflect the total number of components, <T3>e.g.</T3>, rollers and cages, required for each bearing; andbullet; Gross weight input amounts of the Birlad factory for producinginner and outer rings, cages, and other components were corrected; andbullet; Gross material costs of the Birlad factory were adjusted for scrap;no adjustment was permitted for Brasov; and andbullet; Birlad and a portion of the Alexandria factories' labor factorswere adjusted. Although we stated in our preliminary determinations that Yugoslavia'slevel of economic development most closely approximates that of Romania's,we were unable to obtain adequate pricing data from Yugoslavia. Due tothe lack of information from Yugoslavia, we have chosen Portugal as thesurrogate country for purposes of valuing the factors of production inthese final determinations. In our preliminary determinations, we notedthat Portugal's level of economic development also closely approximatesthat of Romania and listed it as one of the five possible surrogate countries(s<T3>ee, </T3>Notice of Preliminary Determinations). Portugal was also chosenas the surrogate country in <T3>TRBs</T3>. We have used the following information to value the factors of production:andbullet; Steel used in the manufacture of steel cages was valued accordingto information supplied by the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon reflecting pricesin Portugal;andbullet; Steel used in the manufacture of the inner and outer rings, balls,and other components was valued according to information obtained fromthe <T3>World Material Study_Europe, </T3>as provided by Torrington and verifiedby the Department; andbullet; Steel scrap was valued according to information supplied by asteel company operating in Portugal; andbullet; Brass used in the manufacture of brass cages was valued accordingto information supplied by the U.S. Embassy in Lisbon reflecting pricesin Portugal; andbullet; Overhead was valued according to information provided by the U.S.Embassy in Lisbon at 22 percent of the cost of production (including depreciation,indirect materials, electricity, methane gas, grease, oil, and water),reflecting overhead of a company currently producing AFBs in Portugal;and andbullet; Portuguese labor rates were based on information supplied by theBureau of Labor Statistics/Division of Foreign Labor Statistics and adjustedfor inflation by OECD Main Economic Indicators. We used the statutory minimum of ten percent of the sum of material andproduction costs (COM) for general, selling and administrative expenses(GSandamp;A), and the statutory minimum of eight percent of COM plus GSandamp;Afor profit. We added U.S. packing to the constructed value, in accordance with section773(e)(1)(c) of the Act. As the value for U.S. packing we used the packingcost of a European based AFB manufacturer currently under investigation,as a Portuguese packing figure was not available. We selected a Europeanproducer that is related to the Portuguese producer because we believethat these related producers have similar packing cost allocations. II. Spherical Roller Bearings We used the factors of production valued in a comparable economy, <T3>i.e., </T3>Portugal, as the basis of foreign market value, as providedfor in 19 CFR 353.8(c). The constructed value and adjustments were identicalto those described above for ball bearings. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversion </ITAG>We made currency conversions in accordance with 19 CFR 353.56(a)(1). Allcurrency conversions were made at the rates certified by the Federal ReserveBank. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Circumstances </ITAG>On August 1, 1988, petitioner alleged that ``critical circumstances'' existwith respect to imports of the subject merchandise from Romania. Section735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstances exist if we determine:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) (i) there is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation;or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) the person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than its fair value;and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the class or kind of merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports. Because the Department's import data pertaining to the subject merchandiseare based on basket TSUSA categories, we requested specific data on shipmentsof the subject merchandise as the most appropriate basis for our determinationsof critical circumstances. Furthermore, we believe that company-specificcritical circumstances determinations better fulfill the objective of thecritical circumstances provision of deterring specific companies that maytry to increase imports massively prior to the suspension of liquidation.We have asked all respondents in each of the AFB investigations to supplymonthly volume shipment data from January 1986 through the present in orderfor the Department to base the critical circumstances determinations oncompany-specific data. Based on our analysis of the monthly shipment datasubmitted by TIE, we have found that imports of the subject merchandisefrom TIE have not been massive over a relatively short period of time.Therefore, we find that the requirements of section 735(a)(3)(B) have notbeen met for TIE. <ITAG tagnum="84">Verification </ITAG>We verified the information used in making our final determinations inaccordance with section 776(b) of the Act. We used standard verificationprocedures including examination of relevant accounting records and originalsource documents of the respondent. Our verification results are outlinedin the public versions of the verification reports which are on file inthe Central Records Unit (Room B-099) of the Main Commerce Building. <ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments </ITAG>As noted above, all comments raised by parties to the proceedings in theantidumping duty investigations on AFBs from nine countries are discussedin Appendix B. <ITAG tagnum="84">Continuation of Suspension of Liquidation </ITAG>We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continue to suspend liquidationof all entries of the subject merchandise from Romania, as defined in the``Scope of Investigations'' section of this notice, that are entered, orwithdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publicationof this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The U.S. Customs Service shall require a cashdeposit or posting of a bond equal to the estimated amounts by which theforeign market value of the subject merchandise from Romania exceeds theUnited States price, as shown below. This suspension of liquidation willremain in effect until further notice. The weighted-average margins areas follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><H1> </H1><H1> Weighted-average margin percentage</H1>Ball bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Tehnoimportexport <D>39.61</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>39.61</D></ITAG>Spherical roller bearings:<ITAG tagnum="2">Tehnoimportexport <D>64.81</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">All others <D>64.81</D></ITAG></ITAG>Because our final critical circumstances determinations are negative, theretroactive suspension of liquidation ordered at the time of the preliminarydeterminations is terminated. All cash deposits or bonds placed on entriesmade by TIE prior to October 27, 1988 shall be refunded.<ITAG tagnum="84">ITC Notification</ITAG>In accordance with section 733(f) of the Act, we have notified the ITCof our determinations. In addition, we are making available to the ITCall nonprivileged and nonproprietary information relating to these investigations.We will allow the ITC access to all privileged and business proprietaryinformation in our files, provided the ITC confirms that it will not disclosesuch information, either publicly or under administrative protective order,without the written consent of the Assistant Secretary for Import Administration.If the ITC determines that material injury, or threat of material injury,does not exist with respect to any of the products under investigation,the applicable proceeding(s) will be terminated and all securities postedas a result of the suspension of liquidation will be refunded or cancelled.However, if the ITC determines that material injury does exist, the Departmentwill issue antidumping duty orders directing Customs officials to assessantidumping duty on AFBs from Romania entered or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption, on or after the effective date of the suspension of liquidation,equal to the amount by which the foreign market value exceeds the UnitedStates price.These determinations are published pursuant to section 733(f) of the Act(19 U.S.C. 1673b(f)).<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
