Dukakis said he was particularly pleased to win another bigstate _ his fourth in a row _ in such a convincing fashion, rackingup a better than 2-1 margin over remaining rival Jesse Jackson.   ``It's a very big boost....particuarly in a state that has beena bellwether state in the general election,'' Dukakis added. ``It'sgoing to be very helpful.''   Asked if the big win meant the nomination is now his, Dukakisrefused to claim the crown yet, refering to Democratic nomineeWalter Mondale's probelms in 1984.   ``I reminded you several time that Fritz Mondale won New Yorkand Pennsylvania and then lost a string of primaries,'' he said.   He said he would not change his campaign themes or strategy.   `I'm going to keep it as strong and positive as I possiblycan,'' Dukakis said.   The next round of contests comes next Tuesday, in Ohio, Indianaand the District of Columbia. Dukakis was heading for Ohio onThursday.   Earlier, Dukakis said Vice President George Bush hasflip-flopped on his pledge not to raise taxes. Bush won theRepublican primary in Pennsylvania, and the contest was expected toyield enough delegates to give him a mathematical lock on thenomination.   Dukakis, bringing up the politically risky tax issue, saidBush's pledge was a shaky one, like the claim by a comic operacharacter that he never gets seasick _ ``What, Never? Hardly ever.''   In recent days, Dukakis has been referring to Bush, his possibleNovember opponent, in answer to questions.   Asked whether he would raise taxes, Dukakis gave his standardanswer:   ``We've got to find new revenue. I don't think any responsiblecandidate for the presidency can rule out new taxes. I can't makethat judgment at the present time.''   Then he added:   ``Even the vice president found that out. He announced onSaturday (promising no new taxes) and then kind of like the captainof the Pinafore, on Monday he said `Well, hardly ever,''' Dukakistold the luncheon crowd.   Dukakis was referring a line from the Gilbert and Sullivanmusical, ``HMS Pinafore.'' In the musical, the ship captain takespart in this famous dialogue:   ``And I'm never, never sick at sea.''   ``What, never?''   ``No, never!''   ``What, never?''   ``Hardly ever.''   When Bush announced his campaign for the 1988 GOP nomination inOctober 1987, he said, ``I am not going to raise your taxes.Period.''   But two days later, Bush said in an interview on the Cable NewsNetwork that he might.   ``What I have said is if I were convinced that all the spendingthat could possibly be constrained or cut had taken place, then andonly then would I consider a tax increase,'' he said.   Dukakis has been talking on the campaign trail about the giantfederal deficit and what he calls the ``fiscal mess'' the nextpresident will inherit from the Reagan administration. And thismess exists even with recent tax increases, he said.   ``The current administration has raised taxes three or fourtimes in six years,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
