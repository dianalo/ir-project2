Arizonais 22-5, 10-3.; Stanford update: The Cardinal probably must win its threeremaining games to even be considered for postseason play. Losing 75-57 toArizona State on Thursday didn't help. Stanford is in eighth place, ahalf-game ahead of Cal, its opponent for the final two games. C Adam Keefecontinues to lead the team in scoring (21.2) and rebounding (9.6). It wasKeefe's slip Jan. 24 that led to a last-second bucket by C Sean Rooks and a78-76 Arizona victory in the teams' first meeting.; Arizona update: The No. 7Wildcats have a 2 1/2-game lead over second-place UCLA (8-6) and WashingtonState (8-6) with five games left. Three of those are at home, where Arizonahasn't lost in 61 games. The latest victim was Duke, which fell 103-96 indouble overtime Sunday. F/C Brian Williams led Arizona with 24 points and 11rebounds. F Chris Mills leads the Wildcats in scoring at 15.3, and Williamsleads in rebounding at 7.8.; Key to the game: Arizona's intensity. If theWildcats come out flat after their emotional victory Sunday, Stanford may havea chance. If they don't, victory No. 62 in a row at home shouldn't be much ofa problem.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  -- Scott Vigallon  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910226  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  250  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 26, 199100057221,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
