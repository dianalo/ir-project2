The Arkansas Democrat roared into New Hampshire after asuccessful pre-primary season, winning endorsements andaccolades for his centrist economic prescriptions. And it'sincreasingly apparent that Mr. Clinton's strategists aretrying to muscle their way to the front of the pack righthere, right now.</LP><TEXT>   As a result, while the Clinton people are publicly playingdown their expectations in the Feb. 18 primary, privatelythey're saying they think they can win the first importantpolitical test of the year. Indeed, Mr. Clinton himself hastold associates that if he wins here, he'll glide to thenomination.   That talk, growing more widespread as the presidentialcampaign gets under way in earnest here, appears premature.   As impressive as Mr. Clinton's detailed programs andproposals are, detached party analysts say he still lacks amessage or overarching theme. If in the next six weeks hisprimary message is merely that he is a moderate, he isrerunning a strategy that, historically at least, has been anon-starter, these analysts say. They add, moreover, that ifhe runs as an outsider, the five-term governor who has hadhis eye on the White House for a decade stretches credulity-- and faces competition from his rivals, some of whom aretemperamentally more the outsider than is Mr. Clintonhimself.   Though there remains no defining edge to his appeal, sofar he has done a better job than any other Democraticcontender.   Even so, the 1992 campaign is still in its early stages.Eight years ago today only Sen. John Glenn of Ohio wasregarded as a threat to former Vice President Walter Mondalein New Hampshire. But by the time this state's ornery votershad their say, insurgent Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado hadcatapulted to the front of the Democratic lists.   &quot;The Democratic race is so wide open there's still roomfor a surprise,&quot; said Charles Brereton, a historian of theNew Hampshire primary. &quot;The process is working the way itshould: People are sitting across the table from thesecandidates and deciding which ones of them make sense.&quot;   One surprise occurred last night, when Virginia Gov.Douglas Wilder withdrew from the presidential race.   Meanwhile, former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, whothis week released a plan tailored for New Hampshire'sdistressed economy, continues to build a strong locally basedorganization. And Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, in a speech inDerry, N.H., yesterday, seemed to stake out territory as thecampaign's most dramatic agent of change, saying that theother Democrats in the race simply &quot;want to tinker around,fine-tune {the} trickle-down economics {of President Bush}and put a Band-Aid on things.&quot;   Political analysts believe, however, that the candidatebest positioned to halt Mr. Clinton may be Sen. Bob Kerrey ofNebraska, whose campaign suffered last year as he wasportrayed as imprecise and impressionistic, reluctant to setout a compelling campaign message. In frank discussions withadvisers, Mr. Kerrey has concluded that he has to be morespecific and must convey a purpose to his campaign.   &quot;In the next two weeks and beyond it's going to beabundantly clear why he's running for president,&quot; saidMichael McCurry, a Kerrey spokesman. &quot;He's clearly determinedto get his message across, and a determined Bob Kerrey is apretty formidable foe.&quot; He has become especially combativeover health care, and at a Manchester senior center Tuesdaynight insisted that his health-insurance plan wouldn'trequire higher taxes and would save the nation $150 billionover five years. &quot;It sounds liberal,&quot; he argued, &quot;but has aconservative impact because it spends less money.&quot;   Mr. Clinton, meanwhile, begins airing a televisioncommercial in New Hampshire this week, joining Mr. Tsongas,whose ads, which began last night, seek to make a virtue ofhis studious bearing. (&quot;He's no movie star,&quot; the ads begin.)Mr. Clinton also has sent copies of his economic plan tolibraries all across New Hampshire and is preparing to sendmore than 60,000 copies to Democratic households in thestate.   As the contenders visit the community centers, highschools, coffee shops and nursing homes that constitute thecampaign trail here, Mr. Clinton increasingly is becoming hisrivals' target -- and the Clinton camp increasingly islooking at itself as holding the exposed position as therace's front-runner.   &quot;He has established himself as the person with the mostinteresting things to say,&quot; said James Carville, a Clintonstrategist.   For now, however, Mr. Clinton and his strategists arearguing that the campaign schedule favors a Southerner likethe governor, even if he doesn't prevail here. Shortly afterNew Hampshire and a handful of Northern primaries andcaucuses, the campaign trail turns south, and on March 10,known as &quot;Super Tuesday,&quot; 12 states, many of them Southern,including Florida and Texas, select 859 of the 2,142delegates needed for the Democratic nomination.   &quot;We have all this fertile country coming up,&quot; said FrankGreer, a Clinton strategist.</TEXT></DOC>
