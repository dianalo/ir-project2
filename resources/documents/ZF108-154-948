Chairman Gordon Moore.andM;Leave it to Moore to lighten up a tough situation.andP;  When members of the Bushadministration threatened to drop their support for programs such as Sematechand DARPA's high-definition display research, Moore had a violin delivered totop Bush advisor and director of the Office of Busget and Management, DickDarman.andP;  Accompanying the gift was a personal note from Moore whichreportedly read something like this:andM;&quot;You might want to have this while you stand and watch Rome burn,&quot; aninformed Capitol Hill source said.andM;Darman reportedly immediately called Moore at home and said he was checkinginto whether acceptance of the violin would be a breach of government ethicslaws.andM;In other areas, the industry/government semi-conductor consortium Sematechrecently issued its first annual report.andP;  At first glance, the report readsmuch like any other.andP;  But on further reading, the brightly yellow-packagedoverview exudes an anxious undercurrent based on international competition.andM;Austin, Texas-based Sematech, a semiconductor manufacturing consortium of 14companies, is charged with reviving the U.S.andP;  semiconductor industry.andP;  Its32-page report is an attempt to rally U.S.andP;  manufacturers to its cause,playing on feelings of American patriotism through editorial comments,sentiment and a brief history lesson on the Revolutionary War.andM;The back page of the report stresses the importance of American unity, citingthe Revolution's example of the famous &quot;Don't Tread on Me&quot; flag of arattlesnake with 13 rattles representing the colonies.andM;Sematech officials have designed their own flag called The AmericanEnterprise Flag.andP;  &quot;History teaches us the value of independence and the highprice our forefathers paid for our freedom,&quot; the report states.andP;  &quot;Today,growing dependence on overseas suppliers for semiconductor manufacturing isthreatening America's strategic defense and weakening our economic strength.andO;The American Enterprise Flag designed by Sematech serves as a symbol ofAmerica's quest for continued independence.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
