Dhomanse, a retired mason, lives in Blokauss, once a village ona sleepy lagoon, whose inhabitants spoke a language called Ebrie.   Now their village is a neighborhood in Abidjan, surrounded bymodern skyscrapers, super highways, shops and apartment buildings.Gone are their fields of yams, cocoa and coffee.   And like many other Africans, the people of Blokauss must speakFrench to be understood outside their neighborhood.   The Ivory Coast has about 60,000 Ebrie speakers, in Blokauss andother villages along the coast. Their distinctive language andculture are threatened by modern development, population growth andthe increasing reliance on French.   ``The development can't be stopped,'' said Koutouan Cassien, aretired primary school director, living in Blokauss. ``Our futureis the future of Ivory Coast.''   The more dominant African languages are succeeding in takingover the functions of European languages, said Joseph Opala, anAmerican linguist and anthroplogist at the University of SierraLeone, but he added: ``As major African languages gain inimportance many local African languages on the periphery willundoubtedly become extinct.''   Some African languages, such as Hausa, a widely spokencommercial language in Niger and northern Nigeria, have adaptedwell to European culture, said Malam Moussa, director of adultliteracy education in Niger. He added that Hausa has become aricher language because of the adaptation.   Many reasons are given for the demise of Africa's smallerlanguages, but the influence of European culture and the growth ofdominant African languages play a part.   In countries like the Ivory Coast, French became the principlemeans of communications because none of its 50 tribal languagesbecame dominant. In Kenya, the emergence of Swahili kept Englishfrom becoming the lingua franca.   Ivory Coast's rapid economic development also accelerated thedominance of French. The country also has a well developededucational system, which has stressed French and pushed nationallanguages into the background.   ``Africans are nervous that if their languages disappear, partof them will disappear as well,'' said Kuadio Jeremie, director ofInstitute of Applied Linguistics at the University of Abidjan. ``Weare in a position where we haven't fully adapted to Europeanculture, nor completely abandoned our own culture.''   What has emerged in Africa is a system called ``diglossia,''where European and African languages serve different functions insociety, said Opala.   European languages, he added, were used on a formal level forgovernment and commerce. African languages were spoken informallyas street and traditional market languages.   ``Words that represent new things are borrowed and adapted tothe language,'' said Moussa, a Hausa speaker. ``It's natural.''   When automobiles arrived in Hausaland they were given the name``mota,'' which is similar to the English motor. In Zimbabwe, Shonaspeakers use ``motocari,'' an adaptation of motor car, the Britishterm for automobile.   Some nations, both former French and English colonies, haverejected demands that one tribal language be made their officiallanguage on grounds it would risk polarizing different ethnicgroups.   ``It's a question of political will,'' said Professor NiangoranBouah, an anthropologist at the University of Abidjan. ``Besides,French has all the advantages the other languages don't. It is anofficial language, a technical language, a work language and theinternational diplomatic language.''   Niger has shown that, even in former French colonies, locallanguages can flourish. In 1973 it implemented an experimentalprimary education system aimed at making students literate in theirown language. There are now 30 such schools providing analternative to the regular primary schools where only French isused.   Bouah said he believes Ivory Coast should introduce locallanguage instruction into the national educational system, but itmay be too late.   ``We are well engaged in the development of French, and I wonderif we will ever be able to return to maternal languages,'' he said.   Local languages remain strong in former British colonies becausethey were left alone, said George Kahari, a Zimbabwean linguist andAfrican literature scholar at the University of Zimbabwe.   He noted that Zimbabwe, formerly British Rhodesia, has a strongtradition of African literature published in local languages,especially in Shona, the principle national language.   On the other hand, ``the French insisted they were bringing acultured, civilized language to Africa and actively promoted itsdomination over local languages,'' he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, April 14</NOTE></DOC>
