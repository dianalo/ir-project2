(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Seabrook nuclear power plant began itsfirst atomic chain reaction Tuesday, a pivotal event for a $6billion project vexed by years of delays, cost overruns and proteststhat made it a focus of the nation's anti-nuclear movement.   Seabrook operators began a sustained nuclear fission reaction inthe plant's 100 tons of uranium fuel at 5:23 p.m., plant officialssaid.   Completed in July 1986, Seabrook received its federal low-powerlicense on May 26, a day after a federal appeals court declined toblock the tests.   Three faulty safety valves delayed initial atomic operations byabout a week. Final preparations for the first fission reactionresumed Monday.   Then plant operators withdrew control rods from the reactor'sfuel core and slowly began diluting the boron concentration in thereactor coolant water. Boron absorbs neutrons, preventing them fromstriking and splitting uranium atoms to release more neutrons,triggering a chain reaction.   Seabrook originally was planned for commercial operation in 1979.A twin reactor was abandoned, 25 percent complete. Both reactorsinitially were to have cost less than $1 billion.   Protests since construction began in 1976 have resulted in morethan 3,200 arrests, including 734 arrests in two days of civildisobedience earlier this month.   Low-power tests must be completed successfully before a nuclearpower plant may operate commercially. But before Seabrook may winits full-power license, it also must gain final approval forevacuation plans for crowded nearby beaches and communities up to 10miles away.   Massachusetts has six communities within 10 miles of Seabrook butrefuses to cooperate, saying evacuation of the area is not feasible.Federal hearings are underway on evacuation plans Seabrook hasdeveloped for Massachusetts.   Federal regulators say approved evacuation plans are not neededfor low-power operation because the tests pose minuscule safetyrisks.   Seabrook's owners also may have to prove they are financiallyqualified to run the plant commercially. Lead owner Public ServiceCo. of New Hampshire is under federal bankruptcy protection, andsome of the other 11 New England utilities with Seabrook shares alsoface financial problems.   But the Nuclear Regulatory Commission ruled in December thatthose troubles pose no safety problem for low-power tests as long asthe owners posted a bond to pay to decommission the reactor afterthe tests should it never operate commercially. Owners posted thebond last month.   Critics had argued that Seabrook should not be allowed to startthe tests and become contaminated by radioactive materials beforecommercial operation is assured and dumps are available for theplant's nuclear waste.   Plant officials maintained that contamination would be minimaloutside the reactor vessel. However, with the start of a fissionreaction, spent uranium fuel would be classified as high-levelradioactive waste.   Political and technical problems have delayed construction of anational high-level nuclear dump, while New Hampshire has been shutout of the nation's three low-level dumps because it has not metfederal deadlines for becoming responsible for its own radioactivewaste.</TEXT></DOC>
