But it didn't outline the measures.    The statement was Kuwait's first official one since British Trade Secretary Lord Young told Kuwait last week to reduce its holding in BP to 9.9% from 21.69%.    Lord Young said then that the divestment should take place over about 12 months, although the timetable should be subject to some flexibility &quot;in the light of market conditions.&quot; Lord Young acted after the Monopolies and Mergers Commission said the Kuwaiti investment might &quot;operate against the public interest.&quot; Kuwait is a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    Meanwhile, Abdul-Malek al-Hamar, United Arab Emirates central bank governor, was quoted in Dubai's al-Bayan newspaper as saying it would be &quot;a good idea that one or more gulf states buy&quot; the BP shares from Kuwait.    Kuwait's Minister of State for Cabinet Affairs, Rashed Abdul-Aziz al-Rashed, made the Kuwaiti statement after the weekly cabinet session. He said after the meeting: &quot;The cabinet has discussed this subject and decided to take all necessary steps to protect Kuwait's economic interests in Britain.&quot;    Oil-rich Kuwait has an estimated $85 billion, in overseas holdings. One-fifth of that is invested in the United Kingdom, through the state-owned Kuwait Investment Office. The KIO accumulated its BP stake after Britain sold its one-third holding in the oil giant last year.    At current market prices, Kuwait stands to lose more than #300 million ($513 million) if it reduces its stake to the level Britain has demanded. </TEXT></DOC>
