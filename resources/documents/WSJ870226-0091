However, Air Force Lt. General James Abrahamson told the House Armed Services Committee that it is still too early to decide whether to deploy such a system, or to predict how much it would cost. Moreover, Gen. Abrahamson said any antimissile program &quot;will be less expensive and a lot easier&quot; if the superpowers agree on a new treaty to reduce offensive nuclear arms.    Following weeks of discord within the Reagan administration over whether to commit the U.S. to an early deployment of at least some parts of the SDI -- or &quot;Star Wars&quot; -- system, Gen. Abrahamson's testimony was decidedly cautious. He characterized the SDI project as research effort aimed at providing &quot;defense options for a future decision.&quot;    Under an early-deployment option mapped out by the Gen. Abrahamson's Strategic Defense Initiative organization, space-based &quot;weapons garages&quot; would be designed to fire high-speed projectiles at Soviet missiles within minutes of when they were launched. Missiles that elude these weapons might then be destroyed before reentering the earth's atmosphere by the ground-based ERIS, which stands for exoatmospheric reentry-vehicle interceptor system.    In 1985, the Pentagon awarded Lockheed a $468 million, five-year contract to build and test-launch seven ERIS missiles. According to Gen. Abrahamson, such a system, together with space-based weapons, &quot;would confound the other side's planning and contribute to stability even in a crisis.&quot;    A satellite would be used to supply early warnings of an attack and to send signals to the weapons platforms.    Gen. Abrahamson said that a second phase of an antimissile defense system would entail more exotic technologies, such as lasers. Current thinking calls for ground-based lasers that would bounce beams off mirrors orbiting in space to hit missiles traveling through space.    Gen. Abrahamson provided few clues about the cost of an antimissile system. &quot;We have the responsibility to bring you an affordable option,&quot; he said, &quot;and we're not there yet.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
