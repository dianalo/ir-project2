Included are discussions of recent animal studiesthat confirm the relationship between cancer and exposure to whole dieselexhaust. Also discussed is epidemiological evidence that associates lungcancer with occupational exposure to diesel engine emissions. On thebasis of the results of these studies, NIOSH recommends that whole-dieselexhaust be regarded as a potential occupational carcinogen in conformancewith the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) cancerpolicy (29 CFR 1900).</TEXT></DOC>
