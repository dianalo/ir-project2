Now, it's intensifying efforts to reform its people.    For decades the auto maker appeared to be running a white-collar welfare system: salaried employees, regardless of individual performance or market conditions, were practically assured of high pay and lifetime employment. But this month, GM is setting up a new compensation system that it hopes will push its salaried employees to work harder -- or will help push those who don't out the door.    &quot;We enjoyed so much success that we didn't have to be as sensitive about the business as we have to be today,&quot; says Roy S. Roberts, vice president for corporate personnel. &quot;This business is so competitive we need everybody pulling their weight.&quot;    The move, which will affect 112,000 low-level managers, clerical workers and other white-collar staffers, is part of a trend across corporate America to tie compensation more closely to performance and to make pay more variable from year to year. &quot;We are moving away from the entitlement era,&quot; says Steven E. Gross, a compensation consultant for Hay Management Group in Philadelphia. &quot;There's a lot of experimentation going on.&quot;    But at GM, with a culture encrusted over decades, the transformation is particularly dramatic. And the effect could go beyond Detroit. &quot;When a huge organization like that goes to the effort to change, everybody says, 'Hey, maybe the time has arrived,'&quot; says David N. Swinford, a vice president in charge of executive compensation for the consulting firm of Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby.    GM made major changes two years ago when it dropped annual cost-of-living raises for salaried employees and established a &quot;pay-for-performance&quot; system. The company also began eliminating 40,000 white-collar positions -- in part by &quot;voluntary&quot; buy-outs that many employees say were involuntary. Last year, GM temporarily suspended all salary increases.    This year raises have been reinstated, but the differences among employees will be greater than ever. &quot;A merit increase . . . is something you have to earn,&quot; says Mr. Roberts. &quot;To treat people fairly you have to treat people differently.&quot;    Previously, most GM managers gave employees a performance grade, like &quot;superior&quot; or &quot;outstanding.&quot; The vast majority got the top rankings, and &quot;merit&quot; raises were &quot;quasi-automatic,&quot; Mr. Roberts says.    Now, GM ranks employees against each other, essentially grading on a curve. Bosses have to pick the top 10%, the next 25%, the next 55%, and the bottom 10% of their group, and enforce pay differences between the tiers. The specifics are up to individual offices.    If an employee's pay is considered &quot;uncompetitive&quot; -- meaning higher than a national or industry average for that job -- the employee will be less likely to get a raise, even if he or she is a good performer. That's bad news for clerical workers, who traditionally received the same pay increases that the unions received. Some salaries, the company estimates, are out of line by as much as 25%.    That doesn't mean, however, that those workers can't get a reward for a job well done. GM this year set up a new &quot;recognition award&quot; fund that will be doled out in lump sums to high performers, regardless of how &quot;competitive&quot; their salaries are.    But the recognition award also serves another important function: It gives GM more discretion to vary pay from year to year. Because few -- if any -- companies cut white-collar salaries, pay raises become permanent. And those raises drive up pensions and other benefits.    GM seems to be trying to change that. Two years ago, the company allocated 8.5% for base-pay raises, through merit pay and cost-of-living adjustments. This year, only 2.5% goes to base-pay raises, and 3.5% comes in the form of one-time lump-sum payments.    Another part of the strategy involves profit sharing, which spread throughout GM after the United Auto Workers obtained the benefit for hourly workers in 1982. Profit sharing allows the company to peg a portion of pay to its corporate health, allocating more money when things are going well and less when they aren't. Indeed, GM's poor performance last year will mean less pay this year.    Also under GM's new compensation plan, managers are encouraged to give immediate, &quot;spontaneous&quot; rewards -- such as theater tickets or trips -- for a clever idea or a great report. The plan is also designed to encourage better cooperation among co-workers. Recognition awards will stem from &quot;team&quot; performance.    Some white-collar workers complain that the new system is simply an elaborate way to reduce their living standard. &quot;It's a way of cutting costs (but also) putting out the right story to quell some anxieties,&quot; says Donald Savage, president of a UAW local representing about 300 GM white-collar workers.    Meanwhile, the top 5,000 officials at GM are also seeing changes in their compensation. Last year, when the auto maker said it would scrap its 70-year-old bonus plan, it effectively wiped out about half the annual pay for certain executives. Instead of cash and stock that they can use right away, top managers are getting restricted stock grants that will take years to mature.    All of this, of course, is designed as a carrot to get people to try harder. But GM is also wielding a bigger stick in case they don't. While the auto maker has always reserved the right to fire incompetent employees, it now, says Mr. Roberts, has &quot;an enlightened sensitivity&quot; about the option. &quot;If you are a poor performer, we're going to work with you to try and make you a better performer,&quot; he explains. &quot;If you cannot do that over time, we'll have to ask you to leave the team.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
