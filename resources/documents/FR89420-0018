Federal policy has long recognized that the initial eligibility determinationprocess requires State agency staff to thoroughly question and verify anapplicant's statements concerning the family's eligibility for AFDC andthe amount of payment (see 38 FR 22007 dated August 15, 1973). An integralfacet of this process is the utilization of ``verification measures'' wherethe worker confirms the applicant's statements by examining documents inhis or her possession or by obtaining information from appropriate third-partysources. We believe that Congress acknowledged the importance of theseverification measures and intended for State agencies to take a criticallook at current measures and enhance their effectiveness in detecting fraudulentapplications as appropriate. Examples of such enhanced verification measuresinclude automated data matches other than those utilized in the IncomeEligibility Verification System (IEVS), error prone profiles, mandatoryhome visits or collateral contacts, and credit bureau inquiries. In order to implement this statutory provision, we are requiring that theState plan be amended to contain a description of the various verificationmeasures used to detect fraudulent applications for AFDC prior to the establishmentof eligibility for such aid. This description should include long establishedmeasures routinely performed by workers, periodic support activities suchas training on investigative interviewing techniques, and any newly establishedinitiatives designed to be performed by or in support of staff responsiblefor pre-eligibility fraud detection. Furthermore, we believe that to ensure the effectiveness of the pre-eligibilityverification process, State agencies must routinely monitor, evaluate,and refine their verification measures as appropriate. We are thereforerequiring that States perform an annual evaluation of their verificationmeasures and submit needed changes as amendments to their State plans.Additionally, we are requiring that a report of the evaluation be submittedto the FSA Regional Office within 45 days following the end of the Federalfiscal year. This will help us evaluate proposed amendments as well asenable us to share valuable ideas with other States. The rule requires that costs attributed to such verification measures willqualify for Federal matching as administrative costs at the 50 percentFederal matching rate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Justification for Dispensing With Notice of Proposed RulemakingThere has been a strong desire for the issuance of definitive Federal policiesregarding pre-eligibility fraud detection measures. The statute requiresfinal rules to be issued six months after the date of enactment (October13, 1988). Accordingly, these provisions are published as an interim finalrule. It would be impracticable to publish this regulation as a Noticeof Proposed Rulemaking in view of the Congressionally mandated publicationdate. In addition, neither the States nor individuals will be affecteddeleteriously in any way as the interim final rule is subject to a 60-daycomment period and we plan to publish a final rule that responds to commentsreceived.Executive Order 12291This interim final rule has been reviewed under Executive Order 12291 anddoes not meet any of the criteria for a major regulation. Therefore, aregulatory impact analysis is not required because this regulation willnot: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more;(2) impose a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies or geographic regions;or (3) result in significant adverse effects on competition, employment,investment, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Paperwork Reduction ActSection 235.111(c) of this interim final rule contains information collectionrequirements which are subject to review by the Office of Management andBudget under section 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub.L. 96-511). Organizations and individuals desiring to submit comments onthis information collection requirement should direct them to the agencyofficial designated for this purpose whose name appears in the preamble,and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, OMB, New ExecutiveOffice Building (Room 3208), Washington, DC 20503, Attention: Desk Officerfor DHHS.Regulatory Flexibility ActThe Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354) requires the Federal governmentto anticipate and reduce the impact of rules and paperwork requirementson small businesses. The primary impact of this interim final rule is onState governments and individuals. Therefore, we certify that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities because it affects benefits to individuals and paymentsto States. Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance Programs 13.780, AssistancePayments-Maintenance Assistance)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 45 CFR 235</ITAG> Aid to Families with Dependent Children, Fraud, Grant programs_socialprograms, Public assistance programs. <ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: April 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Catherine Bertini,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Assistant Secretary for Family Support. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: April 6, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Louis W.
