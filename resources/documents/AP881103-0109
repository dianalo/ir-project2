India rushed in soldiers tohelp the government, sources said.   Indian defense and home ministry sources said the paratrooperstook off from south India after nightfall. The sources spoke oncondition of anonymity.   The Press Trust of India news agency said earlier that India hadthree warships ``ready to sail'' to the neighboring Maldives, wherePresident Maumoon Abdul Gayoom appealed to India and the UnitedStates for help.   In Washington, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidofficials were reviewing the request. ``The Maldives are friendly tothe United States and we generally support them, but in terms ofthis existing situation, it appears to be resolving itself,'' hesaid.   The attackers arrived in the capital, Male, by boat before dawnand attacked the presidential palace.   Ahmed Abdullah Aziz, the Maldivian high commissioner in SriLanka, said the Maldivian government had beaten back the attackers.``The government is in full control of the situation,'' he said.   However, residents of Male, a city of 55,000, said sporadicgunfire continued through the day. By nightfall, foreign gunmen werein control of part of Male, according to Western diplomats inColombo who spoke on condition of anonymnity.   A Sri Lankan government official in Colombo said at least 12people were killed and 22 injured in clashes after the attack. Theofficial, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he received theinformation from the Sri Lankan High Commission in Male.   Western diplomats in Colombo, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said loyalist troops were in control of the capital, butthey said attackers held the radio and television station.   An Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman in New Delhi said reportsfrom the Indian High Commission in Male indicated the attackers wereSri Lankan.   The official said the attackers captured several senior Maldivianofficials, including two members of Gayoom's Cabinet. ``Thesituation is still sketchy,'' he said.   A tropical island chain that is home to 190,000 people, theMaldives are 400 miles southwest of Sri Lanka and India. India isthe regional power and does not want to see the current balanceupset. It has thousands of troops in Sri Lanka to try to quell a warby militant Tamils.   Edward Moss, deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy inColombo, said Maldivian officials contacted the United States,Britain and other countries for help. He did not say if theofficials requested military intervention.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman saidthe Reagan administration has been in touch with India about thecoup attempt.   Another U.S. official, who demanded anonymity, said: ``We arereviewing the situation and discussing options with the Maldives'friends, mainly India.''   Aziz said the raiders spoke Tamil but that he did not know whowas behind the attack. Tamil is not spoken by Maldivians. It is thelanguage of ethnic minorities in Sri Lanka and India.   A Sri Lankan military official said former President IbrahimNasir was believed to be behind the attempt to overthrow Gayoom, whodefeated Nasir in the 1978 election and won a third five-year termon Sept. 23.   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Nasirsent an agent to Sri Lanka to recruit Tamil militants to stage acoup. He said Nasir moved to Singapore after 1978 and his followerstried in 1980 to overthrow Gayoom.   A Sri Lankan pharmacist in Male said she had rushed medicine to agovernment hospital to treat people injured in the attack.   Electricity was cut off in Male and no civilians were on thestreets, she said, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The Maldives' airport was closed and all flights were turnedback, according to officials in Sri Lanka and the Maldives.   ``Male is like a dead city,'' said Sri Lanka's high commissionerin the Maldives, Mohammad Ali. He said the trouble began about 4:30a.m. with a loud explosion, followed by exchanges of gunfire.   Several residents of Male said they were staying off the streetsbecause of uncertainty.   The first reports to reach the outside world said the gunmen hadcaptured the presidential palace and taken Gayoom prisoner, alongwith National Security Minister Ilias Ibrahim and PresidentialAffairs Minister Abbas Ibrahim.
