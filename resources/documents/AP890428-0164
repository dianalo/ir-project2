The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta granted theJustice Department's request for a temporary stay of a lower courtorder that the U.S. Customs Service release the rifles impounded atthe Birmingham, Ala., airport.   The government had contended that the federal district judge'sruling Wednesday could undermine the import ban imposed last monthfollowing public outcry over increased use of assault weapons indrug killings.   The Justice Department said the suit by an Alabama gun dealerchallenged ``actions taken by responsible officials to combat thegrowing epidemic of violent crime and to insure that the statutegoverning gun importation is properly enforced.''   The three-judge panel's ruling came about an hour after U.S.District Judge William Acker Jr. in Birmingham refused to stay hisorder, which was issued Wednesday in a lawsuit brought by the gunimporter.   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms last monthtemporarily suspended importation of up to 640,000 foreign-madeweapons while it determined if the guns were being used forlegitimate sporting purposes.   The government's ``ability to protect the public during thereview process would by definition be irreparably damaged if one ofthe very weapons under scrutiny is allowed to be imported'' andused to kill someone, the Justice Department said in court papers.   Acker ordered the Customs Service to release 1,200 Steyr AUG-SArifles made in Austria.   Gun South Inc. of Trussville, Ala., contended in its suit thatthe permit it obtained to import 5,200 Steyr rifles was approvedbefore the ATF ban took effect.   Gun South, meanwhile, sought an order Friday from Acker that thegovernment show cause why it shouldn't be held in contempt of thejudge's order for refusing to turn over the guns on Thursday.   Donald Wood, the company's president, said in an affidavit thatthe head of the Customs Service's Birmingham office refused to givehim the weapons. Wood said Eldon Green, the Customs official, toldhim he was under orders from superiors in Washington not to releasethe guns despite the judge's order.   In its filing, the Justice Department said that the court ordershould be stayed because ``once released to plaintiff and sold tothe public, the weapons are effectively outside the control of thedefendants, and therefore, capable of being put to anti-personneluses which the ongoing ATF review is designed to investigate.''   The government said Acker's ruling ``is likely to spur similaractions'' by other gun importers.   ``While the 5,200 guns imported by Gun South are a clearlysignificant number of weapons, the suspension of outstandingpermits applies to approximately 640,000 guns,'' the JusticeDepartment noted.   ``The specter of release of approximately 640,000 weapons whichare unlikely to be recovered upon possible reversal of the districtcourt's judgment highlights the potential for harm to the public,''the government's brief said.   Acker's order does not affect other rifles, but in his ruling hecriticized the ban, which was initiated by William Bennett, thefederal drug policy coordinator. Acker held that the import baninterferes with Congress' right to enact laws.</TEXT></DOC>
