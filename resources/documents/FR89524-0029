L. 99-272, amended section 402(a)(26) of titleIV-A of the Social Security Act (the Act) by adding a new subparagraph(C) which requires each applicant or recipient to cooperate with the Statein identifying and providing information to assist the States in pursuingany third party who may be liable to pay for the care and services availableunder the State's plan for medical assistance under title XIX of the Act.An individual may be exempted from this requirement if he or she is determinedto have good cause for refusing to cooperate as determined by the Stateagency in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary which takeinto consideration the best interest of the individuals involved.The statute also provides that States shall not be subject to any financialpenalty in the administration or enforcement of this provision as a resultof any monitoring, quality control, or auditing requirements. Accordingto the conference report, this provision is intended to exclude from thecalculation of AFDC fiscal sanctions for assistance payments any errorsresulting from the application of this policy. These statutory requirementsare effective July 1, 1986.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Proposed Rule Provisions  </ITAG>These proposed rules require, as a condition of eligibility for AFDC, eachapplicant and recipient to cooperate with the State in identifying, andproviding information to assist the State in pursuing, any third partywho may be liable to pay for medical care and services. This is consistentwith the Department's initiative to reduce medical costs to States andthe Federal government, and with the concept of Medicaid as the payor oflast resort. These rules facilitate the pursuit of third party resourcesand thereby assist in reducing Medicaid expenditures of States and theFederal government. When used in this provision, ``third parties'' includeany individual, entity, or program that may be liable to pay all or partof the costs for medical care and services available under title XIX ofthe Act. The term may also include any employment-related or other individualor group health insurance available to or through the dependent child'sparents.We have added a new section 45 CFR 232.13 to reflect this new eligibilityrequirement. We are also adding language to the current regulations at45 CFR 235.70 to provide for the prompt notification to the title XIX agencyof all relevant information to assist in their pursuit of liable thirdparties.The statute provides that individuals who refuse to cooperate with theState in the pursuit of third-party liability for medical services mustbe removed from the assistance unit. The statute also provides that applicantsand recipients may be exempted from this new provision if they are determinedby the State agency to have good cause for refusing to cooperate in accordancewith standards prescribed by the Secretary, which take into considerationthe best interests of the individuals involved. This provision is similarin scope to current regulations at 45 CFR 232.12 which provide for suchgood cause determinations for refusal to cooperate in establishing paternityor obtaining support for an eligible child. Regulations at 45 CFR 232.11on ``Assignment of Rights to Support'' currently include standards formaking determinations of whether good cause exists for an individual'srefusal to comply with child support requirements.In order to provide for consistency between these similar requirements,we propose to make these same good cause standards applicable to the requirementunder this provision. The existing regulations for refusing to cooperateat 45 CFR 232.40-232.49 and 235.70 are being amended, where appropriate,to extend current procedures and policies regarding good cause determinationsfor child support to this new eligibility requirement. Specifically, wepropose to amend 45 CFR 232.40 (a) and (b), 232.42 (a) and (c), 232.44(a) and (b), 232.45 (a), (b), and (c), 232.48(g), 232.49 (a), (c), and(d), 235.70 (a) and (b), and Appendix A to Part 232, to incorporate thosestandards, as are appropriate, for use in determining good cause claimsfor refusal to identify and assist in the pursuit of third parties liable(or potentially liable) for medical services.These rules would also require that the State must provide assistance toan eligible child in the form of protective payments for cases where thecaretaker relative refuses to cooperate. This requirement is consistentwith similar restrictions imposed in cases where individuals refused tocooperate in employment-related activities or in establishing paternityor obtaining support payments. In the latter case, Congress was concernedthat continued receipt of assistance by the uncooperative adult on behalfof other family members would offset, to some degree, the penalty imposedby the State and may lead to a diversion of funds necessary for the well-beingof the child.The requirement to provide assistance in the form of protective paymentshas proven to be an effective method in meeting these concerns. Extensionof this policy to refusal to cooperate in pursuing third-party liabilityfor medical services is similarly essential for the well-being of the child,and is therefore justified under the authority of section 1102 of the Act,which enables the Secretary to make such rules as are necessary for theefficient administration of the program. Accordingly, we propose to amend45 CFR 234.60(a) to provide that protective payments are necessary in caseswhere good cause is not established.Federal financial participation (FFP) is available for gathering third-partyliability information as long as the activity is conducted as part of theadministration of the title IV-A State plan. Such activities include makinggood cause determinations and providing assistance in the form of protectivepayment, as explained in proposed regulation 45 CFR 232.13(c). FFP is notavailable under title IV-A for activities outside the scope of the administrationof a State plan for AFDC, such as the cost of providing medical care andservices.We consider the information gathering activities prescribed in this rule,such as interviewing clients and contacting collateral sources, as partof the administration of the AFDC program. This is necessary because thestatute now requires cooperation in obtaining third party liability formedical care ``as a condition of eligibility for aid.'' Moreover, the Stateplan must now require the IV-A agency to provide to the State Medicaidagency ``all relevant information as prescribed by the State Medicaid agency''as set forth in proposed regulations at 45 CFR 235.70(b)(2). Thus, theinformation gathering requirement for third-party liability is now partof the larger information gathering requirement for the AFDC eligibilitydetermination_these costs must therefore be claimed under title IV-A.To some extent, the information gathering activities prescribed in thisrule may overlap or even duplicate information gathering activities prescribedin 45 CFR 306.50, ``Securing Medical Support Information.'' Nevertheless,the State must claim the costs under title IV-A, rather than title IV-D,since current regulations at 45 CFR 304.23(a) deny FFP under title IV-Dfor activities related to the IV-A program. Only where the State IV-A agencyfails to provide the information specified under 45 CFR 306.50(a), andthe information must be collected and forwarded by the IV-D agency pursuantto that section, is FFP available under title IV-D.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures</ITAG>Executive Order 12291These proposed rules do not meet any of the criteria specified in ExecutiveOrder 12291 for a major regulation because the cost of implementation isexpected to be insignificant.Paperwork Reduction ActPublic reporting burden for the collection of information requirementsat 45 CFR 232.48 is estimated to average 60 minutes per response, includingthe time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gatheringmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate of or anyother aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions forreducing this burden, to the Office of Family Assistance, 5th Floor, 370L'Enfant Promenade SW., Washington, DC 20447; and to the Office of Managementand Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503.Regulatory Flexibility ActThe primary impact of these proposed rules is on State governments andindividuals. Therefore, we certify that these rules, if promulgated, willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities because they affect benefits to individuals and payments to States.Thus, a regulatory flexibility analysis as provided in Pub. L. 96-354,the Regulatory Flexibility Act, is not required.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance Program 13.808, Public Assistance.)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>45 CFR Part 232Aid to families with dependent children, Child support, Grant programs_socialprograms.45 CFR Part 234Grant programs_social programs, Health care, Public assistance programs,Rent subsidies.45 CFR Part 235Aid to families with dependent children, Fraud, Grant programs_social programs,Public assistance programs.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Wayne A.
