(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A huge, white banner stretches over MainStreet downtown Owenton, bearing the uneasy message: ``Owen Countyneeds a doctor. Inquire at Courthouse.''   ``We need two or three doctors,'' said James B. Ellis, 65, aretired state worker. ``But we need at least one awful bad.''   Rural areas across the country are desperate for doctors and areturning to desperate measures to recruit them.   ``My thinking in putting it (banner) up was to let the communityknow that we are going to have a big problem in a few months,'' saidDavid Smith, a general practitioner who is planning to move fromOwenton in March.   The banner paid off with at least one inquiry: A doctor drivingthrough town last week saw it and has begun talking with countyofficials, said county Judge-Executive Horace ``Doug'' West.   But there's nothing definite yet, he added.   Owen County is raising money and hopes to guarantee a first-yearsalary of $75,000 for a family doctor. In the past, the county hasguaranteed wages, given free office space and paid the salaries ofsupport personnel to woo doctors.   But the county of 9,000 people has had trouble keeping youngdoctors in the area.   ``A doctor fresh out of school wants to move closer to home,''West said. ``We're looking for a doctor who wants to make this hishome.''   Smith, 31, who moved here several years ago as part of a federalprogram now being phased out, wants to go home to his family inIllinois. He has said he will leave in March, giving officials sometime to find a replacement.   As of now, Owenton ranks 36th in Kentucky in terms of need for aphysician, said Danise Newton, program administrator for thePhysician Placement Service in the Department of Health Services.   Robertson County is at the top of the list because it doesn'thave any doctors, Ms. Newton said.   ``Kentucky is no different than many other states,'' Ms. Newtonsaid. ``It has a problem finding physicians for rural areas. Thereis no magical way of doing it.''   Ms. Newton said there were several reasons doctors are notchoosing to practice in rural areas.   Hospitals are small or non-existent and doctors experienceprofessional isolation. Often, there is not another physician whowill cover for them, so there is no time off. Most physicians dotheir residency in an urban area and don't want to move to a smalltown. Spouses also have a problem finding jobs.   ``There are much more lucrative practices in northern Kentucky,Lexington or Louisville,'' said Brad Hughes, spokesman for theCabinet for Human Resources. ``Unless doctors are homegrown, they'renot going to a small community.''   The crisis in Owenton is still a few checkups away. Two otherdoctors are practicing in the area, but one wants to retire and theother, Pamela Pieterse, is unsure whether she'll stay after hercontract expires next summer.</TEXT></DOC>
