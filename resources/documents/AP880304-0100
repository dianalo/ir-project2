The February decline brought unemployment to its lowest levelsince the summer of 1979 and followed no change in jobless levelsin January, the Labor Department said.   Employment grew by 280,000, with the number of jobless Americansfalling by 108,000 to 6.9 million, the department said in itssurvey of households.   A separate survey of business payrolls showed a net increase of531,000 jobs in February, 40 percent of which were in serviceindustries.   On Thursday, the department said the nation's productivity rosejust 0.9 percent last year, only slightly more than earlierestimates and the lowest since the last recession, the governmentsays.   Meanwhile, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks slipped7.80 points to 2,063.49, the dollar was mixed in foreign exchangeand bond prices barely budged in lethargic trading.   Productivity among non-farm businesses that are responsible forthree-fourths of the nation's economic activity rose at an annualrate of 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, the Labor Departmentsaid. That contrasted with a 0.2 percent deterioration reported inpreliminary figures last month.   Productivity is a measure of the amount of labor required toproduce goods and services.   The revisions raised the productivity improvement for the entireyear from 0.8 percent to 0.9 percent, slightly more than half the1.6 percent gain of 1986.   The efficiency improvements for the year were the smallest since1982, when an economic recession depressed output so much thatproductivity actually declined 0.6 percent from 1981.   ``Anything less than 1 percent is a disappointing number,'' saidRoger Brinner, an economist for Data Resources Inc. of Lexington,Mass. ``It gives you very little room to buffer pay increases andnot much leeway to improve the standard of living.''   The revised figures on productivity showed output of goods andservices by non-farm businesses rising by an annual rate of 5.6percent in the fourth quarter.   That was the greatest increase in nearly two years and comparedwith a rise of 5.1 percent in the preliminary figures before thegross national product was revised upward last week by the CommerceDepartment.   But in achieving that higher output, businesses increased thetotal hours worked by their employees by 5.3 percent.   ``Frankly, we don't foresee much improvement in productivitythis year,'' said Donald Straszheim, chief economist for MerrillLynch. ``Productivity improvements require rapid growth and wehaven't been experiencing much of that lately.''</TEXT></DOC>
