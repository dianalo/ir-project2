Any agreements would probably result in supply guaranteesto companies taking equity stakes in Venezuelan refineries,the officials said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It is clear that if somebody has a venture with us, thatwould involve long-term supply contracts,&quot; Antonio Cassela,the oil company's director of planning, said in a telephoneinterview.   The move appears to mark a significant policy shift forthe company, which since its nationalization in 1976 hasn'tallowed foreign investment in the petroleum sector.   Recent projects aimed at producing and exporting liquefiednatural gas and gasoline additives have, however, seemed tomany to open cracks in Venezuela's policy of state ownershipof hydrocarbon resources -- though Petroleos de Venezuelaofficials note that foreign capital in the chemicals sectorhas never been completely barred.   The outbreak of the Persian Gulf crisis last August andoil consumers' increasing desire for politically securesupplies have given new impetus to Venezuelan plans to seek abigger share of the U.S. market, company officials said.   Venezuela, which holds the world's fifth largest oilreserves, is seeking to lock in buyers for its oil with aneye to a future in which Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries production quotas aren't any longer in force,analysts said.   Officials at the oil company concede it will be yearsbefore foreign companies become significant refiners inVenezuela. But they say there is little time to lose, withoil prices apparently heading lower and oil accounting formore than 70% of the nation's revenue.   &quot;Yes, it will be years, but it's quite possible that thewhole OPEC quota system will be obsolete by then,&quot; agreedJohn Lichtblau, president of Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation Inc., a consulting group.   The Caribbean is another obvious potential oil source forthe U.S. But, Mr. Lichtblau said, &quot;we are already getting alot of product from there.&quot; He and others say part ofVenezuela's longer-term strategy may be to divert U.S.refiners' interest away from building plants in that region.   Last November, Coastal Corp. began processing at arevamped 100,000-barrel-a-day capacity refinery at SanNicolas in Aruba. The company has plans to boost its capacitythere to 150,000 barrels a day by year's end.   Details of Petroleos de Venezuela's proposals to foreignrefiners aren't yet available. But Enzio D'Angelo, thecompany's director for new ventures and strategic issues,said, &quot;this time we aren't afraid to go to the {Venezuelan}Congress,&quot; which must approve any foreign ventures withstate-owned companies.   &quot;Congress understands now that we can't go by ourselves,&quot;he said. Venezuela's Oil Ministry is said to endorse theplan.   &quot;We have been told by the ministry and the president thatwe must now take advantage of our reserves,&quot; said the oilcompany's Mr. Cassela.   Cyrus Tahmassebi, Ashland Oil Inc.'s chief economist,says: &quot;Given the current glut of crude on the world market,the long-term trend line for prices is below pre-Gulf warprojections, and stronger long-term refining margins will bethe result, prompting aggressive moves to boost refiningcapacity. A lot of people see the {oil} glut coming, and youwill see more of this happening.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
