Subsequent actions taken withregard to the conditions of approval and proposed program amendments canbe found at 30 CFR 913.11, 913.15 and 913.16.   <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Reasons for Amendments   </ITAG><T3>Federal Regulatory Reform   </T3>Between 1981 and 1983, OSMRE extensively revised the Federal regulationsimplementing SMCRA. While most of these revisions provided States withadditional flexibility in meeting the requirements of SMCRA, others addednew requirements. By letter dated May 21, 1985 (Administrative Record No.IL-1015), OSMRE informed Illinois of the specific State regulations inneed of revision to be no less effective than the revised Federal regulations.This amendment package addresses these requirements.   <T3>Remand Order   </T3>On July 29, 1982, the Illinois South Project, Inc. (ISP) and nine otherorganizations challenged the June 1, 1982, decision of the Secretary ofthe Interior approving the Illinois program. On November 30, 1983, theU.S. District Court for the Central District of Illinois, at the requestof the Secretary, remanded the case to the Secretary to review the issuesraised by the plaintiffs (<T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v. <T3>Watt, </T3>Civil Action No. 82-2229). As a result of that review, theSecretary determined that the Illinois program was not fully consistentwith Federal requirements. Consequently, by notice published in the April5, 1984, <T4>Federal Register, </T4>the Director of OSMRE, pursuant to 30 CFR 732.17,notified Illinois of those program provisions in need of amendment (49FR 13494). These requirements were codified at 30 CFR 913.16 (a) through(f). By amendment approved September 28, 1984 (40 FR 38264), Illinois satisfiedthe requirements of 30 CFR 913.16(b). This package contains provisionsaddressing the remaining requirements.   <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Amendments   </ITAG>By letter dated March 28, 1986 (Administrative Record No. IL-1028), forthe reasons discussed above, Illinois proposed extensive revisions to theregulations contained in its program. OSMRE announced receipt of and solicitedpublic comment on the proposed amendments by notice published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on May 9, 1986 (51 FR 23858).   By letter dated July 22, 1986 (Administrative Record No. IL-1038), OSMREnotified Illinois of certain areas in which the proposed amendments appearedto be less effective than the Federal regulations or in conflict with thedecisions of the United States District Court for the District of Columbiain <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation II </T3>(CivilAction No. 79-1144, D.D.C. 1984 and 1985), hereinafter referred to as <T3>In re: Permanent II. </T3>Illinois subsequently revised and resubmittedthe amendments on May 22, 1987 (Administrative Record No. IL-1029A). OSMREannounced the resubmission in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 26, 1987, and reopened the public commentperiod (52 FR 224035). Extensive public comments were received in responseto both notices; however, since no one requested a public hearing nonewas held.   The amendments revise, add or repeal the following parts of Title 62, Chapter1 of the Illinois Administrative Code (IAC): 1700-1701, 1705, 1760-1762,1764, 1770-1780, 1782-1788, 1795, 1800-1801, 1805-1808, 1815-1819, 1824-1828,1840, 1843 and 1845. These parts concern virtually all aspects of the Illinoisprogram. The revisions are intended to address the concerns and requirementslisted in OSMRE's letters of May 21, 1985, and July 22, 1986, and the requirementsresulting from the remand order in <T3>ISP </T3>v. <T3>Watt, </T3>supra. The amendments also include revisions resulting fromthe extensive public comments received and they incorporate the additionalflexibility made available in the revised Federal regulations.   Revised andSection;andSection; 1816.111 through 1816.117 and Parts 1823 and1825 were submitted as program amendments on May 30, 1985, and were approvedby the Director on December 10, 1986 (51 FR 44454-44459). These revisedsections and parts govern revegetation of areas disturbed by surface coalmining operations and establish reclamation requirements for prime farmlandand high capability land.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Director's Findings </ITAG>Set forth below, pursuant to SMCRA and the Federal regulations at 30 CFR732.15 and 732.17, are the Director's findings concerning the proposedamendments submitted by Illinois on May 22, 1987. Only revisions of particularinterest, such as those that address the requirements of OSMRE's May 21,1985 regulatory reform letter and those required pursuant to the remandorder in <T3>ISP </T3>v. <T3>Watt, </T3>are discussed below. Revisions not specifically discussedcontain language identical or similar to the corresponding Federal rules,concerning nonsubstantive wording changes, provide for recodification ofthe rules, or have no Federal counterparts and are not inconsistent withother State or Federal requirements. Many of the following findings use the term ``similar to'' when comparingthe State rules with the corresponding Federal rules. For purposes of thisnotice, ``similar to'' means that the State rules incorporate requirementswhich are substantively identical to the Federal rules or which containonly minor differences no less effective than and having no adverse effecton the degree of environmental protection or public participation affordedby the analogous Federal requirements. 1. Part 1700_General Revisions to this Part affect sections 1700.11_Applicability, 1700.12 Petitionsto Initiate Rulemaking, 1700.13_Notice of Citizens Suits, 1700.14_Availabilityof Records, 1700.15_Computation of Time, 1700.16_Fees and Forfeitures,1700.17_Administration, and 1700.18_Advisory Council on Reclamation. Thefirst five sections are substantively identical to the corresponding Federalregulations at 30 CFR 700.11, 700.12, 700.13, 700.14, and 700.15, respectively.In addition, paragraphs (c) through (e) of section 1700.11 contain provisionscorresponding to 30 CFR 701.11. Illinois has updated and condensed theserequirements, deleting provisions that are inapplicable or moot, but theyremain substantively identical to the corresponding Federal provisionsconcerning the applicability of the permanent program rules and the standardsapplicable to existing structures, as modified by the November 27, 1979,suspension notice (44 FR 67942). Sections 1700.16 and 1700.17 contain provisions pertaining to State accountingprocedures and agency powers and duties, while section 1700.18 governsthe composition, responsibilities and operation of the Surface Mining AdvisoryCouncil. None of these sections contain provisions inconsistent with SMCRAor other Federal requirements. Therefore, the Director finds that the revised sections of 62 IAC Part1700 are no less stringent than SMCRA and no less effective than the correspondingFederal regulations. 2. Part 1701_General Definitions Pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter and other developments, Illinoisrevised a number of definitions in section 1701.5. The revised definitionsare generally similar to the corresponding Federal definitions in 30 CFR700.5, 701.5, 705.5, 761.5, 762.5, 800.5, 816.46 and 817.46. Therefore,with the exception of the definitions of ``previously mined area'' and``valid existing rights'' discussed in Findings 2(b) and 2(c), the Directorfinds that they are no less effective than the Federal rules. The most significant changes are discussed below: (a) <T3>Public building. </T3>The definition of ``public building'' to includebuildings leased by a governmental agency, as does 30 CFR 761.5. (b) <T3>Valid existing rights. </T3>Illinois proposes to revise the definitionof ``valid existing rights'' (VER) in 62 IAC 1701.5 to resemble the languagein the corresponding Federal definition at 30 CFR 761.5. However, on March22, 1985, in <T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia remanded portions of this definition to the Secretary becausehe had failed to provide the public with adequate notice and opportunityto comment on the revised provisions. The remanded portions of the definitioninclude those provisions of paragraphs (a) and (d) which would authorizeuse of the ``takings'' test to determine whether a person possesses VER.Paragraph (c) was also remanded to the extent that it would expand VERunder the ``needed for and adjacent'' test to include lands for which theclaimant had not acquired the necessary property rights prior to August3, 1977. For further explanation of these terms and the court's decision,see the preamble to the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice suspending these portions of the Federaldefinition (51 FR 41954-41955, November 20, 1986). The Illinois program as approved on June 1, 1982, contained provisionssimilar to those remanded by the Federal court. The approval of these provisionswas subsequently upheld by the U.S. District Court for the Central Districtof Illinois (<T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v. <T3>Watt, </T3>C.A. 82-2229), based on the September 14, 1983, revisionsto the Federal definition. However, the plaintiffs appealed this decisionand on March 30, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuitruled that an approval based on a defective (remanded) Federal regulationcannot stand (<T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v. <T3>Hodel, </T3>C.A. 87-2366). The Appeals Court ordered the District Courtto remand the approval of the Illinois VER definition to the Secretaryfor reconsideration under whatever regulation is currently in force. TheDistrict Court did so on June 22, 1988. In light of the order and opinion of the court in <T3>ISP </T3>v. <T3>Hodel, </T3>supra, the Director is temporarily deferring a decisionon the proposed Illinois definition of VER and, by separate notice, isrequesting additional comment on whether the ``takings'' test can be approvedas being no less effective than the ``good faith all permits'' test reinstatedby OSMRE in the previously referenced November 20, 1986, suspension notice.(c) <T3>Previously mined area. </T3>Illinois proposed to add a definition of``previously mined area'' to mean ``land disturbed or affected by earliercoal mining operations that was not reclaimed in accordance with the requirementsof 62 Ill. Adm. Code 1700-1850.'' The corresponding Federal rule at 30CFR 701.5 defines this term as meaning ``land previously mined on whichthere were no surface coal mining operations subject to the standards of[SMCRA].'' The State program provisions referenced in the definition werenot approved until June 1, 1982, well after the effective date of SMCRA(generally May 3, 1978). Also, the State definition does not distinguishbetween lands that were subject to regulation and those that were exempt.Therefore, the State definition would include a greater number of sitesthan would the Federal rule. The Illinois definition resembles an earlier version of the Federal rule,which the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia struck downas being inconsistent with SMCRA because it allowed less than completehighwall elimination in areas mined after SMCRA's reclamation standardstook effect (<T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>July 15, 1985). Since the Illinois definitionis similarly used to determine when an operation is eligible for the lesserreclamation standards of 62 IAC 1816.106 and 1817.106, which include incompletehighwall elimination, the Director finds that the Illinois definition isless effective than the Federal rules and less stringent than SMCRA. Therefore,he is not approving the definition to the extent that it includes landsmined after the effective date of SMCRA, except for those lands mined underone of the exemptions provided by SMCRA. (d) <T3>Coal processing waste. </T3>The definition of ``coal processing waste''has been revised to mean earth materials which are separated and wastedfrom coal during cleaning, concentration or other processing or preparation.This definition is similar to and therefore no less effective than theFederal definition of this term in 30 CFR 701.5. (e) <T3>Coal preparation. </T3>The definition of ``coal processing or coalpreparation'' contained in 1701.5 has been revised to include chemicalor physical processing and to delete reference to the removal of impurities.This definition is similar to and therefore no less effective than theFederal definition of ``coal preparation'' at 30 CFR 701.5. (f) <T3>Historic lands. </T3>The revised definition of ``historic lands'' nowincludes scientific areas, as does 30 CFR 762.5. (g) <T3>Cumulative impact area. </T3>Revised section 1701.5 now includes adefinition for ``cumulative impact area'' which includes considerationof impacts from existing and proposed operations outside the permit area.The definition is similar to and therefore no less effective than the Federaldefinition of this term at 30 CFR 701.5. (h) <T3>Intermittent stream. </T3>As required under 30 CFR 913.16(a) pursuantto the November 30, 1983, remand order of the U.S. District Court for theCentral District of Illinois in <T3>ISP </T3>v. <T3>Watt </T3>(49 FR 13494-13521, April 5, 1984), Illinois revised thedefinition of ``intermittent stream'' in 62 IAC 1701.5 to mean a reachof stream that drains a watershed of at least one square mile. The State'sdefinition is similar to and therefore no less effective than the Federaldefinition at 30 CFR 701.5. 3. Part 1705_Restriction on Financial Interests of State Employees Revisions to this part affect sections 1705.2_Objectives, 1705.4_Responsibility,1705.6_Penalties, 1705.11_Who Shall File, 1705.13_When to File, 1705.15_Whereto File, 1705.17_What to Report, 1705.18_Gifts and Gratuities, 1705.19_ResolvingProhibited Interests, and 1705.21_Appeals Procedures. The Illinois regulations in 62 IAC Part 1705 are similar to the correspondingsections of 30 CFR Part 705, except that the State rules lack any provisionsconcerning members of multiple interest boards and commissions. State lawcurrently provides for one such body, the State Advisory Council on Reclamation(Surface Mining Advisory Council). However, section 1.04(c) of the StateAct and 62 IAC 1700.18(c) specify that the Council shall act solely asan advisory body and that its recommendations shall have no binding effect.Accordingly, the Council has no function or duty under SMCRA, as this termis defined in 30 CFR 705.5, and it is not subject to the requirements of30 CFR Part 705. Therefore, the Director finds that revised 62 IAC Part 1705 is consistentwith 30 CFR Part 705. Should Illinois subsequently establish a multipleinterest board with a function or duty under SMCRA, its members would bedirectly subject to 30 CFR Part 705 under the provisions of 30 CFR 705.1.4. Part 1761_Areas Designated by Act of Congress Revisions to this part affect section 1761.11_Areas Where Mining is Prohibitedor Limited and section 1761.12_Procedures. Except as discussed below, theserules are similar to and therefore no less effective than the correspondingFederal rules at 30 CFR 761.11 and 761.12. (a) <T3>Wild and scenic study rivers. </T3>Illinois has revised 62 IAC 1761.11(a)to include new language protecting study rivers designated under the Wildand Scenic Rivers Act. Like the corresponding Federal rule at 30 CFR 761.11(a)in effect prior to August 15, 1986, the Illinois rule limits this protectionto a corridor extending not more than one-quarter mile from each bank forthe length of the segment being studied. However, on July 15, 1985, in<T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia found the Federal rule to be inconsistent with the regulationspromulgated pursuant to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, which establisha minimum, rather than a maximum, corridor width of one-quarter mile forstudy rivers. On July 16, 1986, OSMRE promulgated a revised version of 30 CFR 761.11(a),which provides that protection shall be afforded to study rivers for thefull extent and width of the corridor established under the appropriateFederal guidelines (51 FR 25818). Therefore, the Illinois provision isless effective than the corresponding Federal rule. As there currentlyare no designated study rivers in Illinois, the Director, rather than disapprovingthis rule, is requiring that Illinois further amend 62 IAC 1761.11(a) toremove the width restriction on the protection afforded to study rivercorridors. <T3>(b) Historic sites. </T3>On July 15, 1985, in <T3>In re: Permanent II, </T3>the U.S. District Court for the Districtof Columbia found the Federal rule at 30 CFR 761.11(c) to be inconsistentwith section 522(e)(3) of SMCRA to the extent that the rule protected onlypublicly owned sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places(NRHP). The Illinois regulations at 62 IAC 1761.11(c) and 1761.12(e)(1)retain similar language and are, therefore, less stringent than SMCRA tothe extent that they do not protect privately owned sites listed on theNRHP. Accordingly, the Director is disapproving the phrase ``publicly owned''in these rules to the extent that it refers to places listed on the NRHP.<T3>(c) </T3><T3>Dwelling waivers. </T3>Pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985, letter, Illinoisrevised 62 IAC 1761.12(d) to specify that written waivers for mining within300 feet of dwellings must clarify that the owner and signator had thelegal right to deny mining and knowingly waived that right. This languageis similar to and therefore no less effective than that of the correspondingFederal rule at 30 CFR 761.12(e). 5. Part 1762_Criteria for Designating Areas as Unsuitable for Surface CoalMining Operations Revisions to this part affect section 1762.12_Additional Criteria and section1762.14_Exploration of Land Designated as Unsuitable for Surface Coal MiningOperations. The Director finds the revised regulations to be similar toand therefore no less effective than the corresponding Federal rules at30 CFR 762.12 and 762.14. 6. Part 1764_State Processes for Designating Areas Unsuitable for SurfaceCoal Mining Operations This part covers sections 1764.11_General Process Requirements, 1764.13_Petitions,1764.15_initial Processing Recordkeeping and Notification Requirements,1764.17_Hearing Requirements, 1764.19_Decision, 1764.21_Data Base and InventorySystem Requirements, 1764.23_Public information, and 1764.25_RegulatoryAuthority Responsibility for Implementation. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois revised 1764.15(e) to eliminate the provisions allowing suspensionof petition reviews. The Director finds amended Part 1764 substantively identical to and thereforeno less effective than 30 CFR Part 764. 7. Part 1772_Requirements for Coal Exploration This Part covers Sections 1772.1_Scope and Purpose, 1772.11_Notice of Requirementsfor Exploration Removing 250 Tons of Coal or Less, 1772.12_Permit Requirementsfor Exploration Removing More than 250 Tons of Coal, 1772.13_Coal ExplorationCompliance Duties, 1772.14_Requirements for Commercial Sale, and 1772.15_PublicAvailability of Information. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions involving coal exploration: (a) New 1772.12(a) contains a provision consistent with 30 CFR 772.12(a)requiring an exploration permit for exploration removing more than 250tons of coal or which will take place on lands designated as unsuitablefor surface mining. (b) New 1772.12(b)(7) contains a provision consistent with 30 CFR 772.12(b)(7)requiring that applications for exploration permits include a statementof why extraction of more than 250 tons of coal is necessary for exploration.(c) New 1772.12(e)(1) contains a provision consistent with 30 CFR 772.12(e)requiring the regulatory authority to notify the applicant, appropriategovernment officials and other commenters on the application, in writing,of its decision on exploration applications. (d) On June 9, 1987, the Secretary notified the State of Illinois of achange required as a result of recently approved Federal regulations. Thechange requires Illinois to add a provision at 1772.12(b)(8)(D) which wouldrequire that applications for exploration operations intending to removemore than 250 tons of coal include any additional information which theDepartment may require regarding known or unknown historic and archeologicalresources. On September 18, 1987, Illinois submitted proposed regulationsto OSMRE to address the required change, and a final decision by OSMREis forthcoming under a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. The Director finds the Illinois regulations in new Part 1772 substantivelyidentical to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 772, with the exceptionnoted in Finding 7(d). 8. Part 1773_Requirements for Permits and Permit Processing This Part covers Sections 1773.1_Scope and Purpose, 1773.11_Requirementsto Obtain Permits, 1773.12_Regulatory Coordination with Requirements UnderOther Laws, 1773.13_Public Participation in Permit Processing, 1774.14_Opportunityfor Public Hearing, 1773.15_Review of Permit Applications, 1773.17_PermitConditions, and 1773.19_Permit issuance and Right of Renewal. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,new Illinois Part 1773 corrected the following deficiencies: (a) New 1773.12 requires coordination of the review and issuance of permitsfor surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Under the State rule,permit applications are submitted for review by the Interagency Committeeand the Department must assure that comments and recommendations by theCommittee address compliance with the applicable requirements of variousFederal acts. The provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 773.12. (b) New 1773.13(a) establishes provisions for filing and public noticefor submission of administratively complete applications for permits, significantrevisions and renewals. This provision is consistent with 30 CFR 773.13(a).(c) New 1773.13(a)(1)(F) requires that the public notice indicate if theapplication includes a request for an experimental practice and identifythe regulatory provisions for which a variance is requested. The provisionis consistent with 30 CFR 773.13(a)(1)(vi). (d) New 1773.13(d)(3) establishes provisions for confidentiality of certaininformation contained in applications. These provisions are consistentwith confidentiality provisions contained in 30 CFR 773.13(d)(3). (e) New 1773.15(c) requires compliance with all of Part 1785. This provisionis consistent with 30 CFR 773.15(c). On June 9, 1987, the Secretary notifiedIllinois of a change required as a result of recently revised Federal regulations.The change added a new finding to the list of written findings at 30 CFR773.15(c) which the regulatory authority must make prior to approving anypermit application or application for a significant revision to a permit.This finding states that the regulatory authority has taken into accountthe effect of the proposed permitting action on properties listed on oreligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. It alsostates that this finding may be supported in part by inclusion of appropriatepermit conditions or operation plan changes to protect historic resources,or a documented decision that no additional protective measures are necessary.On September 18, 1987, Illinois submitted proposed regulations to OSMREto address the required change. A final decision by OSMRE is forthcomingunder a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. (f) New 1773.17(g) requires payment of reclamation fees consistent with30 CFR 773.17(g). The Director finds the Illinois regulations in new Part 1773 substantivelyidentical to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 773 except as notedin Finding 8(e). 9. Part 1774_Revision; Renewal; and Transfer, Assignment, or Sale of PermitRights This Part covers sections 1774.11_Department Review of Permits, 1774.13_PermitRevisions, 1774.15_Permit Renewals, 1775.17_Transfer, Assignment, or Saleof Permit Rights. (a) New 1774.15(c)(1)(D) specifies that the State shall not approve a permitunless it finds that the operator has liability insurance. This provisionis consistent with 30 CFR 774.15(c)(1)(iv). (b) New 1774.17(e)(1) establishes that the State must notify the permittee,the successor, commenters and OSMRE of findings, consistent with 30 CFR774.17(e)(1). (c) New 1774.17(e)(2) requires the successor to permit rights to notifythe State, consistent with 30 CFR 774.17(e)(2). The Director finds the Illinois regulations in new Part 1774 substantivelyidentical to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 774. 10. Part 1775 Administrative and Judicial Review of Decisions This part covers andSection;1775.1_Scope and Purpose, 1775.11_AdministrativeHearing, and 1775.13_Judicial Review. The Director finds the Illinois regulations in new Part 1775 substantivelyidentical to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 775. 11. Part 1777_General Content Requirements for Permit Applications This Part covers Section 1777.11_Format and Contents, 1777.13_Reportingof Technical Data, 1777.4_Maps and Plans: General Requirements, 1777.15_Completeness,and 1777.17_Permit Fees.The Director finds Illinois regulations in new Part 1777 substantivelyidentical to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 777. 12. Part 1778_Permit Applications: Minimum Requirements for Legal, Financial,Compliance and Related Information This Part covers sections 1778.13_Identification of Interests, 1778.14_ViolationInformation, 1778.15_Right of Entry Information, 1778.16_Relationship toAreas Designated Unsuitable for Mining, 1778.17_Permit Term, 1778.18_Insurance,1778.21_Proof of Publication, and 1778.22_Facilities or Structures Usedin Common. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions: (a) Revised 1778.13(e) now requires applications to include the name andaddress of each legal owner of the surface and mineral property to be minedand the names and addresses of owners of property contiguous to the permit.Paragraph 1778.13(e) is therefore consistent with 30 CFR 778.13 (e) and(f). (b) Revised 1778.13(g) now requires applications to include the MSHA numberfor all structures requiring MSHA approval. Paragraph 1778.13(g) is thereforeconsistent with 30 CFR 778.13(g). (c) Revised 1778.13(h) requires applications to include a statement ofall lands, interest in lands, options, or pending bids or interests heldor made by the applicant for land contiguous to the area described in thepermit application. Paragraph 1778.13(h) is therefore consistent with 30CFR 778.13(h). (d) Revised 1778.14(c) requires a listing of notices of violations receivedby a subsidiary, affiliate or person controlled by or under common controlwith the applicant consistent with 30 CFR 778.14(c).The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1778 substantivelysimilar to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 778. 13. Part 1779_Surface Mining Permit Applications: Minimum Requirementsfor Information on Environmental Resources This Part covers sections 1779.4_Responsibilities, 1779.5_Use of ExistingData, 1779.6_Use of Expert Opinion, 1779.11_General Requirements, 1779.12_GeneralEnvironmental Resources Information, 1779.11_Vegetation Information, 1779.20_Fishand Wildlife Resources Information, 1779.21_Soil Resources Information,1779.22_Land Use Information, 1779.24_Maps: General Requirements, and 1779.25_CrossSections, Maps and Plans. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985, letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions to Part 1779: <T3>(a) Historic properties. </T3>Revised 1779.12(b) and 1783.12(b) requirethat permit applications include information on properties eligible forlisting on the National Register of Historic Places. However, as notedin the Director's letter of June 9, 1987, additional revisions are neededfor these rules to be no less effective than 30 CFR 779.12(b) and 783.12(b).Illinois has submitted these revisions as a separate proposed amendment,which the Director is now processing in a separate rulemaking. <T3>(b) </T3><T3>Fish and wildlife. </T3>Revised 1779.20 and 1783.20 require that permitapplications include the same fish and wildlife information as that requiredby 30 CFR 779.20 and 783.20 as they existed at the time of submission.However, on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47352), these Federal rules were revisedand combined with other sections. The Director will separately notify Illinoisof the additional changes needed as a result of the December 11, 1987 revisionsto the Federal rules. Except as noted in Findings 13(a) and 13(b) above, the Director finds theIllinois regulations in amended Part 1779 identical to and therefore noless effective than those of 30 CFR Part 779. 14. Part 1780_Surface Mining Permit Application: Minimum Requirements forReclamation and Operation Plan Revisions to this Part affect sections 1780.4_Responsibilities; 1780.5_Useof Existing Data; 1780.6_Use of Expert Opinion; 1780.11_Operation Plan:General Requirements; 1780.12_Operation Plan: Existing Structures; 1780.13_OperationPlan: Blasting; 1780.14_Operation Plan: Maps and Plans; 1780.15_Air PollutionControl Plan; 1780.16_Fish and Wildlife Plan; 1780.18_Reclamation Plan:General Requirements; 1780.21_Hydrologic Information; 1780.22_GeologicInformation; 1780.23_Reclamation Plan: Postmining Land Uses; 1780.25_ReclamationPlan: Ponds, Impoundments, Banks, Dams, and Embankments; 1780.27_ReclamationPlan: Surface Mining Near Underground Mining; 1780.29_Diversions; 1780.31_Protectionof Public Parks and Historic Places; 1780.33_Relocation or Use of PublicRoads; 1780.35_Disposal of Excess Spoil; 1780.37_Transportation Facilities;and 1780.38_Rehabilitation of Siltation Structures, Diversions, Impoundments,and Treatment Facilities. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985, letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions involving Parts 1780 and 1784: (a) <T3>Analytical methodology.</T3> Revised 1780.21(a) and 1784.14(a) prescribethe methodology to be used when sampling and analyzing water quality. Allwater quality sampling and analyses performed to meet water monitoringrequirements must be conducted according to methodology consistent withthat set forth in 30 CFR 780.21 and 784.14.(b) <T3>Fish and wildlife.</T3> Revised 1780.16 and 1784.21 require a fishand wildlife plan similar to that required by 30 CFR 780.16 and 784.21before those Federal rules were revised on December 11, 1987. The Directorwill separately notify Illinois of the further changes needed as a resultof the revised Federal rules promulgated on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47352).(c) <T3>Surface water information.</T3> Revised 1780.21(b)(2) and 1784.14(b)(2)require that the application include the name and ownership of surfacewater bodies, surface water quality information for the adjacent area,and baseline alkalinity information in a manner similar to and thereforeno less effective than 30 CFR 780.21(b)(2) and 784.14(b)(2).(d) <T3>Supplemental hydrologic information.</T3> Revised 1780.21(b)(3) and1784.14(b)(3) provide that, if the determination of the probable hydrologicconsequences (PHC) of mining indicates that adverse impacts to the hydrologicbalance on or off the proposed permit area may occur, or if acid-formingor toxic material is present that may result in the contamination of groundwateror surface-water supplies, then supplemental information shall be provided.The revised State rules are identical to and therefore no less effectivethan 30 CFR 780.21(b)(3) and 784.14(b)(3).(e) <T3>Alternative water supplies.</T3> Revised 1780.21(e) requires that theapplication include alternative water source information in cases wherethe PHC determination indicates that the proposed operation may resultin contamination, diminution or interruption of underground or surfacewaters currently in use. The State rule is identical to and therefore noless effective than 30 CFR 780.21(e).(f) <T3>PHC determinations.</T3> In revised 62 IAC 1780.21(f) and 1784.14(e),Illinois requires that each permit application contain a determinationof the probable hydrologic consequences of mining on the proposed permitand adjacent areas, as do the Federal rules at 30 CFR 780.21(f) and 784.14(e).However, unlike the Federal rules, the State rules do not require thatthe determination be based on baseline data collected for the permit applicationor that it include certain specific findings. Nor do the Illinois regulationsrequire that each application for a permit revision be reviewed to determinewhether a new or updated determination is necessary. Therefore, the Directorfinds that the State rules are less effective than the Federal regulations,and he is requiring that Illinois further amend 62 IAC 1780.21(f) and 1784.14(e)to be no less effective than 30 CFR 780.21(f) and 784.14(e).(g) <T3>Permit revisions.</T3> Revised 1780.21(g)(2) and 1784.14(f)(2) requireapplications for revisions to be reviewed to determine whether a new orupdated assessment of cumulative hydrologic impacts is required. The revisedrules are similar to and therefore no less effective than 30 CFR 780.21(g)(2)and 784.14(f)(2).(h) <T3>Hydrologic reclamation plan.</T3> Revised 1780.21(h) and 1784.14(g)require that applications contain a hydrologic reclamation plan indicatinghow the relevant requirements of Parts 1816 and 1817 will be met, whatmeasures will be taken to avoid acid or toxic drainage, and how the potentialadverse hydrologic consequences identified in the PHC determination willbe prevented or mitigated. The revised rules are identical to and thereforeno less effective than 30 CFR 780.21(h) and 784.14(g).(i) <T3>Groundwater monitoring.</T3> Revised 1780.21(i) and 1784.14(h) requirethat the application's groundwater monitoring plan provide for the monitoringof parameters that relate to the suitability of the groundwater for currentand approved postmining land uses. The revised rules also require thatmonitoring data be submitted to the State every three months for each monitoringlocation. The revised rules are similar to and therefore no less effectivethan 30 CFR 780.21(i) and 784.14(h).(j) <T3>Surface-water monitoring.</T3> Revised 1780.21(j) and 1784.14(i) requirethat the surface-water monitoring plan be based on the PHC determinationand that the paramenters monitored be related to the suitability of thesurface water for the current and approved postmining land uses. The revisedrules also specify certain parameters that must be monitored in all casesand require that point source discharges be monitored in accordance with40 CFR Part 434. The revised rules are similar to and therefore no lesseffective than 30 CFR 780.21(j) and 784.14(i).(k) <T3>Geologic information</T3> Revised 1780.22(b) and 1784.22(b) requirethat applications contain geologic information for areas adjacent to thepermit area and include chemical analyses of each stratum down to and includingthe deeper of either the stratum immediately below the lowest coal seemto be mined or any acquifer below the lowest coal seam to be mined whichmay be adversely impacted by mining. The revised rules are identical toand therefore no less effective than 30 CFR 780.22(b) and 784.22(b).(1) <T3>Air pollution control plan.</T3> New 1780.15 and 1784.26 specify thatapplications shall contain air pollution control plans as required by 30CFR 780.15(b) and 784.26. Illinois has elected not to require air qualitymonitoring. Since monitoring is an optional requirement under the Federalrules, its omission does not render the State rules less effective thanthe corresponding Federal rules.Other than as noted in paragraphs (b) and (f) above, the Director findsthat the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1780 are either similar tothose of 30 CFR Part 780 or add additional clarifying or State-specificprovisions, and that they are therefore no less effective than the Federalrequirements.15. Part 1783_Underground Mining Permit Applications: Minimum Requirementsfor Information on Environmental Resources Revisions to this Part affect Sections 1783.4_Responsibilies, 1783.5_Useof Existing Data, 1783.6_Use of Expert Opinion, 1783.11_General Requirements,1783.12_General Environmental Resources Information, 1783.14_VegetationInformation, 1783.20_Fish and Wildlife Resources Information, 1783.21_SoilResources Information, 1783.22_Land Use Information, 1783.24_Maps: GeneralRequirements, and 1783.25_Cross Sections, Maps and Plans.These revisions are identical to those discussed in Finding 13 for Part1779. Except as noted in Findings 13(a) and 13(b), the Director finds theIllinois regulations in amended Part 1783 to be similar to and thereforeno less effective than 30 CFR Part 783. The State has also added certainclarifying and State-specific provisions which do not affect this finding.16. Part 1784-Underground Mining Permit Applications: Minimum Requirementsfor Reclamation and Operation PlanRevisions to this Part affect Sections 1784.4_Responsibilities; 1784.5_Useof Existing Data; 1784.6_Use of Expert Opinion; 1784.11_Operation Plan:General Requirements; 1784.12_Operation Plan: Existing Structures; 1784.13_ReclamationPlan: General Requirements; 1784.14_Hydrologic Information; 1784.15_ReclamationPlan: Postmining Land Uses; 1784.16_Reclamation Plan: Ponds, Impoundments,Banks, Dams and Embankments; 1784.17_Protection of Public Parks and HistoricPlaces; 1784.18_Relocation or Use of Public Roads; 1784.19_UndergroundDevelopment Waste; 1784.20_Subsidence Control Plan; 1784.21_Fish and WildlifePlan; 1784.22_Geologic Information; 1784.23_Operation Plan: Maps and Plans;1784.24_Transportation Facilities; 1784.25_Return of Coal Processing Wasteto Abandoned Underground Workings; 1784.26_Air Pollution Control; 1784.27_Rehabilitationof Siltation Structures, Diversions, Impoundments and Treatment Facilities;1784.29_Diversions; and 1784.200_Interpretive Rules Related to GeneralPerformance Standards.Except as discussed below, the revisions to 62 IAC Part 1784 are identicalto those made to 62 Part 1780, as discussed in Finding 14, and the revisedrules are similar to the corresponding Federal rules in 30 CFR Part 784.Therefore, except as discussed in Findings 14(b) and 14(f), the Directorfinds revised 62 IAC Part 1784 to be no less effective than 30 CFR Part784.(a) <T3>Subsidence control plans.</T3> Revised 1784.20(b) requires subsidencecontrol plans to include a map of underground workings describing the locationand extent of areas in which planned subsidence mining methods will beused and which includes all areas where measures will be taken to preventor minimize subsidence and subsidence-related damage. In addition, 1784.20(c)has been revised to require that subsidence control plans include a descriptionof physical conditions, such as depth of cover, seam thickness, and lithology,which affect the likelihood or extent of subsidence and subsidence-relateddamage. The revised rules are similar to and therefore no less effectivethan 30 CFR 784.20 (b) and (c).(b) <T3>Subsidence monitoring.</T3> Revised 1784.20(d)(5) requires the subsidencecontrol plan for room-and-pillar operations to include information on anyplanned monitoring to determine the commencement and degree of subsidenceso that other appropriate measures can be taken to prevent or reduce materialdamage. However, unlike the State rule, the Federal rule at 30 CFR 784.20(d)also requires this information for operations using planned subsidencemethods. Since revised 1784.20(f) requires a description of measures tobe taken in accordance with 1817.121(c) to mitigate or remedy any subsidence-relatedmaterial damage, Illinois has indicated that this provision can be usedto require monitoring if necessary. Therefore, the Director finds thatrevised 62 IAC 1784.20(d)(5) is no less effective than 30 CFR 784.20(d).17. Part 1785-Requirements for Special Categories of MiningRevisions to this Part affect Sections 1785.1_Scope, 1785.2_Objective,1785.13_Experimental Practices Mining, 1785.14_Mountaintop Removal, 1785.15_SteepSlope Mining, 1785.16_Permits Incorporating Variances from ApproximateOriginal Contour Restoration Requirements, 1785.17_Prime Farmlands, 1785.18_Variancesfor Delay in Contemporaneous Reclamation Requirement in Combined Surfaceand Underground Mining Activities, 1785.20 Augering, 1785.21_Coal PreparationPlants Not Located Within the Permit Area of a Mine, 1785.22_In Situ ProcessingActivities,1785.23_Minor Underground Mine Facilities Not at or Adjacentto the Processing or Preparation Facility or Area.As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985, letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions involving Part 1785:(a) Section 1785.13(e) has been revised to require that experimental practicesgranting variances from the special environmental protection performancestandards applicable to prime farmlands be approved only after consultationwith the Soil Conservation Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The revised rule is similar to and therefore no less effective than 30CFR 785.13(e).(b) Revised 1785.13(g) requires review of experimental practices no lessthan every two and one half years consistent with 30 CFR 785.13(g).(c) Revised 1785.17(b) now specifies the nature and type of reconnaissanceinspections that must be made of the proposed permit area to determinewhether or not prime farmland is present. 1785.17(b)(1) specifies thatreconnaissance inspections shall be either a review of an existing soilsurvey for the proposed permit area or an onsite inspection of the proposedpermit area. This specificity within the Illinois regulations as to thenature and extent of reconaissance inspections is consistent with 30 CFR785.17(b)(1) which requires the regulatory authority to consult with theU.S. Soil Conservation Service to determine the nature and extent of eachindividual reconnaissance survey.(d) Illinois regulations 1779.27 and 1783.27 have been repealed. Illinoisregulations no longer provide for the regulatory authority to approve anegative determination of prime farmland on the basis of slope and otherfactors such as rocky surface and flooding. The repeal of 1779.27 and 1783.27is consistent with 30 CFR 785.17.(e) Revised 1785.17(c)(1)(B) now requires soil surveys to include a descriptionof soil mapping units and a representative soil profile as determined bythe SCS, including, but not limited to, soil horizon depths, pH, and rangeof soil densities within the permit area. The rule is therefore consistentwith 30 CFR 785.17(c)(1)(ii).(f) Revised 1785.17(c)(1)(B) now allows other representative soil profiledescriptions from the locality to be used if their use is approved by theSCS State Conservationist. The rule is therefore consistent with 30 CFR785.17(c)(1)(ii).(g) Revised 1785.17(c)(1)(B) now also allows the Department to requestthe operator to provide information on other physical and chemical soilproperties as needed to make a determination that the operator has thetechnological capability to restore the prime farmland. The rule is consistentwith 30 CFR 785.17(c)(1)(ii).(h) Resubmitted 1785.17 no longer exempts land not historically used ascropland, areas smaller than minimum size of soil map units and areas otherwiseexempt from the prime farmland performance standards in 1823. Deletionof these exemptions from the prime farmland application requirements wasrequired under 30 CFR 913.16(c) pursuant to the November 30, 1983 remandorder in <T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v.<T3> Watt</T3>, supra.The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1785 similarto and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 785.18. Part 1795_Small Operator AssistanceThis part covers sections 1795.1_Scope and Purpose, 1795-3_Authority, 1795.4_Eligibilityfor Assistance, 1795-7_Filing for Assistance, 1795.8_Application Approvaland Notice, 1795.9_Program Services and Data Requirements, 1795.10_QualifiedLaboratories, and 1795.11_Assistance Funding.As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions to Part 1795:(a) Revised 1795.4 defines ``Qualified Laboratory'' consistent with theFederal definition contained in 30 CFR 795.3. In addition, under new 1795.10(a)the State program administrator selects a qualified laboratory to makethe determination and statement. Illinois provides for qualification andselection of laboratories, as is required by OSMRE.(b) New 1795.6(b)(4) establishes that annual coal production for SOAP eligibilityshall include all coal produced by operations owned by members of the applicant'sfamily and relatives. The rule is therefore consistent with 30 CFR 795.6(a)(iv).(c) Revised 1795.12(a)(3) now establishes the SOAP applicants shall reimbursethe Department for the cost of the laboratory services if the permit issold, transferred or assigned to another person and the transferee's annualproduction exceeds 100,000 tons. The provision is consistent with 30 CFR795.12(a)(3).(d) New 1795.6 (c) and (d) establish as a criterion for eligibility forassistance that the applicant is not restricted in any manner from receivinga permit under the permanent regulatory program. The provision is consistentwith 30 CFR 795.6(a) (3) and (4).The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1795 similarto and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 795.19. Part 1800_Bonding and Insurance Requirements for Surface Coal Miningand Reclamation OperationsThis part covers sections 1800.1_Scope and Purpose, 1800.4_Department Responsibilities,1800.5_Definitions, 1800.11_Requirement to File a Bond, 1800.12_Form ofthe Performance Bond, 1800.13_Period of Liability, 1800.14_Determinationof Bond Amount, 1800.15_Adjustment of Amount, 1800.16_General Terms andConditions of Bond, 1800.17_Bonding Requirements for Underground Coal Minesand Long-Term Coal-Related Surface Facilities and Structures, 1800.20_SuretyBonds, 1800.21_Collateral Bonds, 1800.30_Replacement of Bonds, 1800.40_Requirementto Release Performance Bonds, 1800.50_Forfeiture of Bonds, and 1800.60_Termsand Conditions for Liability Insurance.Significant changes are discussed below:(a) New 1800.4(e) establishes that operating without a bond is a violationof a condition upon which the permit was issued. Paragraph 1800.4(e) istherefore consistent with 30 CFR 800.4(g).(B) New State rule 1800.5(b) establishes a definition for collateral bondwhich is consistent with the Federal definition in 30 CFR 800.5(b). TheState rule does not allow real property to be posted as collateral bond;however, it is not required to do so under 30 CFR 800.4.(c) New 1800.21(e) establishes that persons with an interest in collateralposted as bond, and who desire notification of actions pursuant to thebond, shall request the notification in writing to the Department at thetime the collateral is offered. This provision is consistent with 30 CFR800.21(f).(d) New 1800.50(e)(1) provides that, in the event the amount forfeitedis insufficient to pay for the full cost of reclamation, the operator shallbe liable for remaining costs. Paragraph (e)(1) also allows the Departmentto complete or authorize completion of reclamation of the bonded area andto recover from the operator all costs of reclamation in excess of theamount forfeited. These provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 800.50(d)(1).(e) New 1800.40(b)(1) provides that the Department may arrange with thepermittee to allow access to the permit area, upon request, by any personwith an interest in bond release for the purpose of gathering informationrelevant to the bond release proceeding. This provision is consistent with30 CFR 800.40(b).(f) <T3>Standards for issuance of permits to persons who forfeit bond.</T3>Illinois is adding a provision at 62 IAC 1800.50(f) to prohibit any personwho forfeits a bond from receiving another permit unless that person makesfull restitution of reclamation costs for the forfeited site, correctsall violations, pays all civil penalties, posts a cash bond for the newpermit, and accepts personal liability for all future violations. Section510(c) of SMCRA and 30 CFR 773.15(b) prohibit the unconditional issuanceof permits to applicants with either outstanding violations or a demonstratedpattern of willful violations of a nature and duration resulting in suchirreparable damage to the environment as to indicate an intent not to complywith program requirements. Otherwise, neither SMCRA nor the Federal regulationsspecify the conditions under which a person who forfeits bond may receiveanother permit. For this reason, and since 62 IAC 1773.15(b) contains provisionsidentical to those of 30 CFR 773.15(b) with which the State would alsohave to comply, the Director finds that Section 1800.50(f) is not inconsistentwith any Federal requirement.(g) <T3>General.</T3> This amendment consolidates the State's bonding and insurancerequirements, which were previously located in Parts 1800 through 1808,into Part 1800; all other parts are being repealed. The revised rules includeminimum requirements and procedures similar to those in the correspondingFederal rules at 30 CFR Part 800. In addition, the State has included additionalsafeguards and more specific procedural requirements throughout. Illinoishas elected not to accept self-bonds, phased bonds, self-insurance or collateralbonds secured by real estate; it is not required to do so under 30 CFR800.4, which grants States discretion in deciding what types of bond andinsurance to accept. Therefore, the Director finds that revised 62 IACPart 1800 is no less effective than the corresponding Federal rules in30 CFR Part 80.20. Part 1815_Permanent Program Performance Standards for Coal ExplorationRevisions to this Part affect sections 1815.1_Scope and Purpose, 1815.13_RequiredDocuments, and 1815.15_Performance Standards for Coal Exploration. As requiredpursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17, Illinois revised1815.15(a) to specify that habitats of unique or unusually high value forfish, wildlife and other related environmental values and critical habitatsof threatened or endangered species identified pursuant to the EndangeredSpecies Act shall not be disturbed during coal exploration. The revisedIllinois regulations in amended Part 1815 are similar to and thereforeno less effective than the corresponding Federal rules in 30 CFR Part 815.21. Parts 1816 and 1817_Permanent Program Performance Standards for SurfaceMining Activities and Underground Mining OperationsRevisions to these nearly identical parts affect all sections except 1816.45/1817.45(general requirements for sediment control measures), 1816.47/1817.47 (dischargestructures), 1816.59/1817.59 (coal recovery), 1817.99 (slides and otherdamage), 1816.111/1817.111 through 1816.116/1817.116 (revegetation), 1817.131(temporary cessation of operations), 1816.150/1817.150 (roads), 1817.182(minor underground mine facilities), and 1816.190/1817.190 (affected acreagemap).Except as noted in paragraphs (k) and (hh) below, the revised rules aresimilar to and therefore no less effective than the corresponding Federalrules in 30 CFR Parts 816 and 817. Illinois has also added several clarifyingspecifications to these rules, none of which alter their meaning or intentor adversely affect this finding.As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions to Parts 1816 and 1817:(a) Revised 1816.61(c) and 1817.61(d) require blast designs to be submittedfor blasting operations that will be conducted within 1,000 feet of anybuilding used as a dwelling, public building, school, church or institutionalbuilding or within 500 feet of an underground mine. These provisions areconsistent with 30 CFR 816.61(d) and 817.61(d).(b) Existing Illinois regulation 1850.13(c) provides that the blaster shallprovide direction and on-the-job training to all non-certified blastingpersonnel under his supervision. Thus, existing 1850.13(c) is consistentwith 30 CFR 816.61(c)(4)(ii) and 817.61(c)(4)(ii).(c) Revised 1816.62(a) and 1817.62(a) establish that at least 30 days beforeinitiation of blasting in a permit area, the operator shall notify, inwriting, all residents or owners of structures located within one-halfmile of the permit area how to request a pre-blast or condition survey.The State rule submitted on March 28, 1986, contained an exemption notin the Federal rules that such notification shall not be required for anystructure where a survey has been previously requested by the present orprevious resident or owner and the survey has been conducted by the permitteeand copies of the survey have been provided to the owner or resident andthe Department. Program amendments resubmitted on May 22, 1987, no longercontain the exemption. Therefore, the State's rules at 1816.62(a) and 1817.62(a)are consistent with 30 CFR 816.62(a) and 817.62(a).(d) Revised 1816.62(d) and 1817.62(d) require that any surveys requestedmore than 10 days prior to the beginning of blasting as stated in the publishedschedule shall be completed by the operator before the start of blasting.These provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 816.62(e) and 817.62(e).(e) New 1816.67(b) and 1817.67(b) establish airblast limits which are consistentwith limits required under 30 CFR 816.67(b) and 817.67(b). The Illinoisrules contain the exception provided in the Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.67(e)(2)and 817.67(e)(2), which provide that if a building owned by the personconducting surface mining activities is leased to another person, the lesseemay sign a waiver relieving the operator from meeting airblast limits.(f) New 1816.67 and 1817.67(b) do not require periodic monitoring of airblasts. 30 CFR 816.67(b)(2) and 817.67(b)(2) require the operator to conductperiodic monitoring to ensure compliance with airblast standards. In requiringperiodic monitoring, OSMRE explained (46 FR 9796, March 8, 1983) that toensure airblast levels are met the location of seismographic monitoringequipment may not be the critical or appropriate location for airblastmonitoring. Wind, temperature, and overcast conditions can affect maximumairblast location. Therefore, the Federal rule includes a general provisionfor periodic airblast monitoring by the operator in which the locationsand periods of such monitoring are left to the discretion of the operatorand the regulatory authority. Illinois' revised 1780.13(b) requires theapplicant to describe the proposed system for monitoring compliance with1816.67 including the proposed locations for airblast monitoring equipment.This arrangement is acceptable since the Department can require properplacement of monitoring equipment.(g) New 1816.67(c) and 1817.67(c) establish maximum ground vibration limitsconsistent with 30 CFR 816.67(d) and 817.67(d). The State provisions in1816.67(e) include lesser peak particle velocity limits at the locationof any dwelling, public building, school, church or building. The provisionsalso are consistent with the Federal regulations for distances greaterthan 5,000 feet from the blast.(h) New 1816.68(b) and 1817.68(b) require that air blast and ground vibrationrecords be retained for a period of three years. Records must include thetype of instrument, its sensitivity and calibration signal or certificationof annual calibration, and the date and time of the recording. These provisionsare similar to and therefore no less effective than 30 CFR 816.68(b) and817.6(b).(i) Revised 1816.102(a)(4) and 1817.102(a)(4) require that disturbed areasbe backfilled and graded to minimize erosion and water pollution both onand off the site. This provision is identical to and therefore no lesseffective than 30 CFR 816.102(a)(4) and 817.102(a)(4).(j) New 1817.121(g) requires all underground operators to submit, on orbefore March 1 of each year, three mine maps of underground workings tothe Department. The State's rule establishes map format and content requirementswhich are similar to and therefore no less effective than those of 30 CFR817.121(g).(k) Revised 1816.97(b) and 1817.97(b) provide that no surface or undergroundmining activity shall be conducted which will jeopardize the continuedexistence of endangered or threatened species listed by the Secretary orwhich will result in the destruction or adverse modification of designatedcritical habitats of such species in violation of the Endangered SpeciesAct. The Illinois rules also require the Department, upon notificationby the operator of the presence of such species, to consult with appropriateState and Federal fish and wildlife agencies to determine whether and underwhat conditions operations may proceed. These provisions are consistentwith 30 CFR 816.97(b) and 817.97(b) as they existed prior to December 11,1987. On that date, to conform to the language of the Endangered SpeciesAct, the Director promulgated revised rules that prohibit the conduct ofactivities which ``would be likely to'' (rather than ``will'') jeopardizethe continued existence of such species or their critical habitats. Furthermore,the revised rules require the reporting of State-listed as well as Federally-listedspecies (54 FR 47352).The Director is separately notifying Illinois of the additional changesneeded as a result of the revisions to the Federal rules. In the interim,he expects that Illinois will implement its regulations in a manner consistentwith the Federal Endangered Species Act, which remains applicable in allcases.(l) Revised 1816.97(c) and 1817.97(c) specify that no surface or undergroundmining activity shall be conducted in a manner which would result in theunlawful taking of a bald or golden eagle. These rules also require thatthe operator promptly report any sightings of eagles. As revised, theserules are identical to and therefore no less effective than the correspondingFederal rules at 30 CFR 816.97(c) and 817.97(c).(m) Revised 1816.83 and 1817.83 no longer allow the State to waive therequirement for subdrainage control on coal mine waste refuse piles. Sections1816.83 and 1817.83 as revised are thus similar to and no less effectivethan the corresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.83 and 817.83.(n) New 1816.84(b)(1) and 1817.84(b)(1) specify that coal mine waste impoundingstructures may not be retained permanently. This provision is identicalto and therefore no less effective than 30 CFR 816.84(b)(1) and 817.84(b)(1).(o) New 1816.89(d) and 1817.89(d) require that hazardous materials be handledin accordance with the Federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act.Although the corresponding OSMRE rules have been suspended, section 505(b)of SMCRA allows States to adopt provisions more stringent than their Federalcounterparts. Furthermore, the rules merely acknowledge the existence andapplicability of other Federal statutes and regulations. The State rulesare therefore not inconsistent with any Federal requirement.(p) Revised 1816.71(f) and 1817.71(f) require excess spoil to be transportedand placed in a controlled manner in horizontal lifts not exceeding fourfeet in thickness. However, the rules also provide that the Departmentmay approve a design which incorporates placement of excess spoil in horizontallifts other than four feet in thickness when it is demonstrated by theoperator and certified by a qualified registered professional engineerthat the design will ensure the stability of the fill. These provisionsare consistent with 30 CFR 816.71(e)(2) and 817.71(e)(2).(q) Revised 1816.71(j) and 1817.71(j) require that a registered professionalengineer or other qualified professional specialist under the directionof a registered professional engineer experienced in the construction ofearth and rockfill embankments periodically inspect fills during construction.The State's rules at 1816.7171(j)(2) and 1817(j)(2) require the registeredprofessional engineer to provide a certified report of each inspection.These provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 816.71(h) and 817.71(h).(r) Revised 1816.71(j) (2), (3), (4) and (5) and 1817.71(j) (2), (3), (4)and (5) require the filing of certified reports on the drainage systemand protective filters for certain fills. Such reports are to include colorphotographs taken during and after construction, but before the underdrainsare covered with excess spoil. If the underdrain system is constructedin phases, each phase must be certified separately. Also where excess durablerock spoil is placed in single or multiple lifts such that the underdrainsystem is constructed simultaneously with excess spoil placement, colorphotographs are to be taken to the underdrain as the underdrain systemis being formed. The photographs accompanying each certified report areto be taken in adequate size and number with enough terrain or other physicalfeatures of the site shown to provide a relative scale and to clearly identifythe site. These provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 816.71(h)(3) and817.71(h)(3).(s) Revised 1816.71(b)(1) and 1817.71(b)(1) now require the fill to bedesigned using current, prudent engineering practices. In addition, a qualifiedregistered professional engineer experienced in the design of earth androck fills shall certify the design. These provisions are consistent with30 CFR 816.71(b)(1) and 817.71(b)(1). (t) Revised 1816.41(a) and 1817.41(a) require that all surface and undergroundmining activities be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologicbalance within the permit and adjacent areas and to prevent material damageto the hydrologic balance outside the permit area. These provisions areconsistent with 30 CFR 816.41(a) and 817.41(a). (u) Revised 1816.41(c)(2) and 1817.41(c)(2) require that, when the analysisof any ground water sample indicates non-compliance with the permit conditions,the operator promptly notify the Department. These provisions are consistentwith 30 CFR 816.41(c)(2) and 817.41(c)(2). (v) Revised 1816.41(f)(1)(A) and 1817.41(f)(1)(A) require drainage fromacid- and toxic-forming materials into surface water and ground water tobe avoided by identifying and burying and/or treating, when necessary,materials which may adversely affect water quality, or be detrimental tovegetation or to public health and safety if not buried and/or treated.These provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 816.41(f) and 817.41(f). (w) Revised 1816.41(i) and 1817.41(h) govern discharges into undergroundmines and require a demonstration that the discharge will prevent materialdamage outside the permit area. These provisions are consistent with 30CFR 816.41(i) and 817.41(h). (x) Revised 1816.43(a)(1) and 1817.43(a)(1) require diversions to be designedto minimize adverse impacts to the hydrologic balance within the permitand adjacent areas, to prevent material damage outside the permit areaand to assure the safety of the public. These provisions are consistentwith 30 CFR 816.43 and 817.43. (y) Revised 1816.43(b)(1) and 1817.43(b)(1) require the Department to approvediversions within the permit area after finding that the diversion willnot adversely affect water quality and related environmental values under1816.57 and 1817.57. These provisions are consistent with 30 CFR 816.43(b)and 817.43(b). (z) Revised 1816.43(b)(5) and 1817.43(b)(5) require the design and constructionof all stream channel diversions of perennial and intermittent streamsto be certified by a qualified registered professional engineer. Theseprovisions are consistent with 30 CFR 816.43(b)(4) and 817.43(b)(4). (aa) Revised 1816.49(a)(1) and 1817.49(a)(1) require that temporary andpremanent impoundments which meet the criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) complywith the requirements of 30 CFR 77.216 and State rules 1816.49 and 1817.49.The plan submitted to MSHA shall also be submitted to the Department aspart of the permit application. These provisions are similar to and thereforeno less effective than the corresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.49and 817.49. (bb) Revised 1816.46(b)(5) and 1817.46(b)(5) require that siltation structuresbe maintained until removal is authorized by the Department and the disturbedarea has been stabilized and revegetated. In no case shall structures beremoved sooner than two years after the last augmented seeding. These provisionsare similar to and therefore no less effective than the corresponding Federalrules at 30 CFR 816.46(b)(5) and 817.46(b)(5). (cc) Revised 1816.49(a)(2) and 1817.49(a)(2) require the design of temporaryand permanent impoundments to be certified by a qualified registered professionalengineer experienced in the design and construction of impoundments, inaccordance with 62 IAC 1780.25(a). These provisions are similar to andtherefore no less effective than the corresponding Federal rules at CFR816.46(a)(2) and 817.46(a)(2). (dd) Revised 1816.49(a)(3) and 1817.49(a)(3) require that impoundmentsbe designed and constructed to maintain a seismic safety factor of at least1.2 and a minimum static safety factor of 1.5 for the normal pool understeady seepage saturation conditions. These factors of safety are identicalto and therefore no less effective than those of 30 CFR 816.49(a)(3) and817.49(a)(3). (ee) Revised 1816.49(a)(10) (A), (B) and (C) and 1817.49(a)(10) (A), (B)and (C) require that impoundments be inspected by or under the directionof an experienced registered professional engineer regularly during construction,upon completion of construction, and at least yearly until removal of thestructure or release of the performance bond. Illinois has also revisedthese rules to require that copies of the certified inspection reportsbe maintained at or near the minesite. These provisions are identical toand therefore no less effective than those of the corresponding Federalrules at 30 CFR 816.49(a)(10) and 817.49(a)(10). (ff) Revised 1816.49(a)(12) and 1817.49(a)(12) establish procedures tobe followed if any examination or inspection of an impoundment disclosesthat a potential hazard exists. These procedures are similar to and thereforeno less effective than the corresponding emergency procedures specifiedat 30 CFR 816.49(a)(12) and 817.49(a)(12). (gg) Revised 1816.49(b)(2) and 1817.49(b)(2) require the quality of waterin permanent impoundments to be suitable for its intended use and meetwater quality standards set forth in 1816.42 and 1817.42. These requirementsare identical to and therefore no less effective than those of the correspondingFederal rules at 30 CFR 816.49(b)(2) and 817.49(b)(2). (hh) Revised 1816.49(b)(9), 1817.49(b)(9), 1816.49(c) and 1817.49(c) requirethat impoundments not meeting the size criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) beconstructed with a spillway that can safely discharge the runoff from,for permanent impoundments, the 50-year, 6-hour precipitation event, orfor temporary impoundments, the 25-year, 6-hour precipitation event. Thecorresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.49(b)(7) and 817.49(b)(7) require,at a minimum, use of the 50-year, 6-hour event for all permanent impoundmentspillway structures, while 30 CFR 816.49(c)(2) and 817.49(c)(2) require,at a minimum, use of the 25-year, 6-hour event for all temporary impoundmentspillway structures. Under the proposed Illinois rules, spillways for impoundmentsmeeting the size criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) would be governed only bythe provisions of 30 CFR 77.216, which does not contain similar spillwaysize requirements. Therefore, the Director finds that the proposed rulesare less effective than the corresponding Federal rules and he is requiringthat the State revise 1816.49 (b)(9) and (c) and 1817.49 (b)(9) and (c)to include specific spillway size requirements for all impoundments.(ii) Revised 1816.95(a) and 1817.95(a) require that the exposed surfaceareas be protected and stabilized to control erosion and air pollutionattendant to erosion. These provisions are identical to and therefore noless effective than the corresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.95(a)and 817.95(a). In addition to the preceding revisions addressing the concerns raised inOSMRE's letter of May 21, 1985, Illinois made the following revisions tocomply with the remaining requirements of 30 CFR 913.16 resulting fromthe November 30, 1983 remand order in <T3>Illinois South Project </T3>v. <T3>Watt, </T3>supra: (jj) Revised 1816.46 and 1817.46 include sedimentation pond and siltationstructure design and performance standards similar to and no less effectivethan those of 30 CFR 816.46 and 817.46, thus satisfying the requirementsof 30 CFR 913.16(d). (kk) Revised 1816.62(a) and 1817.62(a) require that, at least 30 days beforeinitiation of blasting within a permit area, the operator notify, in writing,all residents or owners of structures located within one-half mile of thepermit area of their right to request a preblast survey and the proceduresto do so. The revised rules are identical to and therefore no less effectivethan the corresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR 816.62(a) and 817.62(a).Illinois has thus complied with the requirements of 30 CFR 913.16(e). (ll) Revised 1816.67(d) and 1817.67(d) specify that flyrock, includingblasted material traveling in the air or along the ground, shall not becast beyond the permit boundaries, beyond the area of regulated access,or more than one-half the distance to the nearest dwelling or other occupiedstructure. These provisions are similar to and no less effective than thoseof 30 CFR 816.67(d) and 817.67(d); they thus satisfy the requirements of30 CFR 913.16(f). 22. Part 1819_Special Performance Standards for Auger Mining This Part covers sections 1819.1-Scope, 1819.11-General, 1819.13-Coal Recovery,1819.15-Hydrologic Balance, 1819.17-Subsidence Protection, 1819.19-Backfillingand Grading and 1819.21-Protection of Underground Mining. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois made the following revisions involving Part 1819: (a) Rule 1819.11(c)(1), which had allowed auger holes discharging watercontaining toxic-forming or acid-forming material to be plugged or thedischarge treated, has been deleted. New Illinois rule 1819.15(b)(1) requiressealing consistent with 30 CFR 819.15(b)(1). (b) New Illinois rule 1819.17 now requires that auger mining be conductedin accordance with the requirements of 1817.121(a) and (c) and is no lesseffective than 30 CFR 819.17. The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1819 similarto and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 819. 23. Part 1824_Special Performance Standards: Mountaintop Removal This Part covers sections 1824.1-Scope, 1824.2-Objective and 1824.11-PerformanceStandards. The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1824 similarto and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 824. 24. Part 1825_Special Performance Standards on High Capability Lands This Part covers sections 1825.11-Special Requirements, 1825.12-Soil Removal,1825.13-Soil Stockpiling and 1825.14-Soil Replacement. The Director finds that the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1825 (forwhich there is no Federal counterpart) do not adversely affect other aspectsof the program and are not inconsistent with SMCRA or the Federal regulations.25. Part 1827_Special Performance Standards: Coal Preparation Plants NotLocated Within the Permit Area of a Mine This Part covers sections 1827.1-Scope, 1827.11-Applicability, and 1827.12-PerformanceStandards. The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1827 to besimilar to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 827. 26. Part 1828_Special Performance Standards: In Situ Processing This Part covers sections 1828.1-Scope, 1828.2-Objectives, 1828.11-PerformanceStandards and 1828.12-Monitoring. The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1828 to besimilar to and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 828. 27. Part 1840. Department Inspections This Part covers sections 1840.1-Scope, 1840.2-Monitoring and Reporting,1840.11-Inspections by the Department, 1840.12-Right of Entry, 1840.14-Availabilityof Records, 1840.15-Citizen's Requests for State Inspections, 1840.16-Reviewof Adequacy and Completeness of Inspections and 1840.17-Review of DecisionNot to Inspect or Enforce. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois revised section 1840.14(b) to establish that copies of all records,reports, inspection materials or information obtained by the Departmentshall be available to the public in the area of mining until at least fiveyears after expiration of the operation. Illinois rule 1840.14(b) is thusconsistent with 30 CFR 840.14(b). The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1840 similarto and therefore consistent with 30 CFR Part 840. 28. Part 1843_State Enforcement This Part covers sections 1843.11-Cessation Orders, 1843.12-Notices ofViolations, 1843.13-Suspension or Revocation of Permits, 1843.14-Serviceof Notices of Violation, Cessation Orders and Show Cause Orders, 1843.15-InformalPublic Hearing, 1843.16-Formal Review of Citations, 1843.17-Temporary InjunctiveRelief, 1843.18-Inability to Comply, 1843.20-Intervention, 1843.21-Discovery,and 1843.22-Petitions for Award of Costs and Expenses Under section 525(e)of the Federal Act. As required pursuant to OSMRE's May 21, 1985 letter under 30 CFR 732.17,Illinois, in 62 IAC 1843.11(a)(2), has added language requiring the issuanceof a cessation order to any person conducting surface coal mining and reclamationoperations without a valid surface coal mining permit. This new provisionis similar to and therefore no less effective than the corresponding Federalrule at 30 CFR 843.11(a)(2).The Director finds the Illinois regulations in amended 62 IAC Part 1843to be consistent with the corresponding Federal rules at 30 CFR Part 843in that the Illinois rules incorporate sanctions no less effective thanthose of 30 CFR 843.11, 843.12, and 843.13 and include similar proceduralrequirements.29. Part 1845_Civil PenaltiesRevisions to this part affect section 1845.11_How Assessments are Made,1845.12_When Penalty Will be Assessed, 1845.13_Factors to be Consideredin Assessing Civil Penalties, 1845.15_Assessment of Civil Penalties, 1845.18_Paymentof Assessment; Hearing Request Deadline, 1845.19_Procedures for Hearing,and 1845.20_Final Assessment and Payment of Penalty.Most revisions are editorial in nature or add specificity without alteringthe intent or meaning of the rules. The chief substantive change is theaddition of specific penalty determination formulas, procedures and thresholds.This penalty determination method is based on the four factors requiredby section 518(a) of SMCRA (history of previous violations, seriousnessof the violation, permittee negligence, and any demonstrated good faithin attempting to achieve rapid compliance) and incorporates all mandatorypenalties established by SMCRA.In addition, Illinois has revised 62 IAC 1745.17(b) to specify that failureto serve a proposed assessment within 30 days of issuance of the noticeor order shall not be grounds for dismissal unless the person assessedproves actual prejudice as a result of the delay and makes timely objectionto the delay. This provision is similar to and no less effective than 30CFR 845.17(b)(2).The Director finds that the Illinois regulations in amended Part 1845 incorporatepenalties and sanctions no less stringent than those set forth under sections518 and 521 of SMCRA and no less effective than the regulations in 30 CFRPart 845. Except for the lack of provisions for assessment conferences,which States need not include in their programs, the Illinois rules alsocontain the same or similar procedural requirements as the correspondingFederal rules, as required by the cited sections of SMCRA.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Disposition of Agency and Public Comments</ITAG>As described in the section of this notice entitled ``Discussion of Amendments,''OSMRE twice solicited public comment on the proposed amendments. Also,as required under 30 CFR 732.17(h) (4) and (11), the Director solicitedthe views of the State Historic Preservation Officer and all Federal agencieswith an actual or potential interest in the proposed amendments.All comments received on the proposed regulations, both as originally submittedon March 28, 1986, and as resubmitted on May 22, 1987, are discussed below.Where different commenters provided similar comments, only one responsehas been provided.Agency Comments<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Comments of the State Historic Preservation Officer aresummarized and discussed under the ``Public Comments'' section (CommentNos. 149-157).</ITAG>1. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) commented that proposed section1773.12, which lists the Federal laws with which mining permits must comply,does not mention several important environmental statutes, such as theClean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. EPA states that these missing lawsshould be added to the list in section 1773.12.Illinois rule 1773.12 requires coordination of the review and issuanceof permits with the same list of Federal Acts and Executive Orders as containedin 30 CFR 773.12 and is therefore consistent. EPA's comment was consideredby OSMRE in development of 30 CFR 773.12. At 48 FR 44357 (September 28,1983), OSMRE stated that permit review should be coordinated with actionstaken to comply with other Federal statutes. In the Illinois program, allFederal or State governmental agencies with applicable permit-issuing authoritywill be notified under State's 1773.13(a)(3)(A) and given opportunity tocomment.2. EPA commented that in proposed 1773.13 only persons who may be adverselyimpacted by the decision on the permit application may comment on the applicationbut that 40 CFR 25.3 allows any person to comment on permit applications.40 CFR Part 25 sets forth minimum requirements for public participationin activities under the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation andRecovery Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. It is 30 CFR Part 773 whichsets forth requirements for public participation in State regulatory programsunder SMCRA. In this regard Illinois' 1773.13 allowing only persons whomay be adversely impacted to comment is consistent with 30 CFR 773.13.3. EPA commented that under proposed 1774.13(d)(5) incidental changes caninclude increases to the permit area in excess of 20 percent, possiblymuch higher and that potential adverse impacts to water resources can occurif the monitoring systems are not expanded and changes in permitted effluentlimits are not made. EPA recommended a tighter definition of incidentalboundary changes and stated that any change to the permitted area shouldresult in a reevaluation of the monitoring networks and effluent limitsas well as any other environmental impacts.Section 511(a)(2) of SMCRA provides that the regulatory authority shallestablish guidelines for a determination of the scale or extent of a revisionrequest for which all permit application information requirements and proceduresshall apply. 30 CFR 774.13 mandates that the regulatory authority establishguidelines for the scale or extent of revisions for which all permit applicationinformation requirements and procedures (including notice, public participationand notice of decision) shall apply. The Federal rule further states thatthese procedures shall apply, at a minimum, to all significant permit revisions.30 CFR 774.13(d) establishes that any extensions to the area covered bythe permit except incidental boundary revisions shall be made by applicationfor a new permit. Thus the scale and extent of incidental boundary revisionsis left to the State regulatory authority to incorporate into the Stateprogram. Illinois establishes the scale and extent in 1774.13(d). Changeswhich qualify as incidental boundary revisions under the Illinois rulemust be applied for and reviewed by the Department. All potential adverseimpacts to water and other resources must be considered and the Departmentmust modify or expand monitoring systems and make changes to permittedeffluent limits if appropriate and warranted by the additional area. Classificationas an incidental boundary revision allows omission only of procedural requirements,not review and evaluation requirements.4. EPA commented that proposed Illinois regulation 1780.15 dealing withair pollution control plans has been limited to 30 CFR 780.15(a)(2) and(b)(2) of the Federal regulations dealing solely with a plan for fugitivedust control practices as required under 30 CFR 816.95. EPA notes thatno plan for monitoring air pollution is proposed. Resubmitted Illinois1780.15 requires each application to contain a plan for fugitive dust controlpractices as required under 1816.95. The Federal rules for air pollutioncontrol plans require an air quality monitoring program for operationseast of the 100th meridian only if so required by the regulatory authority.Since Illinois operations fall within this category, Illinois regulation1780.15 is consistent with 30 CFR 780.15(b). Paragraph (a) of the Federalrule does not apply.  5. EPA noted that proposed Section 1784 describes a comprehensive monitoringprogram for both ground and surface waters but that the permittee shouldbe required to submit a quality assurance plan covering the parametersto be monitored and the plan should be made part of the permit application.EPA also commented that the permittee should make available all monitoringdata obtained from the permittee's monitoring activities. Resubmitted Illinoisregulations 1784.14(h) and (i) dealing with ground water and surface watermonitoring plans are consistent with Federal regulations 784.14(h) and(i).  6. EPA commented that the list of parameters which the permittee must monitorfor surface water monitoring programs in proposed 1784.14(i)(2)(A) shouldonly be a minimum list of parameters and the State should have the authorityto require monitoring of additional pollutants, if necessary. Resubmitted1784.14(i)(2)(A) is consistent with 30 CFR 784.14(i)(2)(i). Resubmitted1784.14(i)(3) allows for additional monitoring requirements if it is determinedthe existing or proposed monitoring plan is not adequate to detect adverseimpacts to the hydrologic balance.  7. EPA commented that proposed 1784.26, dealing with an air pollution controlplay for underground mining permits, significantly limits the Federal regulationsdealing with fugitive dust control practices under 30 CFR Section 817.95.30 CFR 784.26(a) provides that the application shall contain an air qualitymonitoring program if required by the regulatory authority. Illinois haschosen not to require an air quality monitoring program. Resubmitted 1784.26does require a plan for fugitive dust control practices and is consistentwith Federal regulations.  8. EPA commented that proposed 1817.41, dealing with groundwater protection,does not include 817.41(b)(2) of the Federal regulations. Part (b)(2) of817.41 was suspended by OSMRE on February 21, 1985 (50 FR 7278) and removedon December 2, 1987 (52 FR 45920).  9. EPA commented that proposed 1817.46(b)(3), which deals with undergroundmining, refers to ``surface'' mining instead of ``underground'' mining.Resubmitted 1817.46(b)(3) uses the term ``underground'' instead of ``surface''. 10. EPA commented that definitions of many of the terms in the rules wouldbe helpful. Examples of terms needing definition included ``shadow area''and ``adjacent area''. Definitions are given in Section 1701.5 of Illinois'regulations. Both ``shadow area'' and ``adjacent area'' are defined inSection 1701.5.  11. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented that thedefinition of affected area contained in the Illinois resubmitted regulation1701.5 should be revised to read in part, ``any water or surface land overwhich those activities are conducted or located''. The suggestion wouldsubstitute the word ``over'' for ``upon'' in reference to underground miningactivities. Because the term ``affected area'' as utilized by Illinoisalso includes surface areas for underground mines not over undergroundmining areas the substitution would not be appropriate.  12. The FWS pointed out that the Illinois definition of land use in resubmittedregulation 1701.5 could be read such that the reference to vegetation wouldinfer that such vegetation would not affect the quality or value of variousland uses. Illinois utilized the exact language of the Federal counterpart,30 CFR 701.5, and therefore is consistent. It was further suggested bythe FWS that the Illinois definition of ``recreation'' be expanded to includewildlife observation and hunting. The Illinois regulation includes otherundeveloped recreational uses in which the suggested activities would beincluded and therefore is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations.The FWS also requested that the term ``dedicated'' be removed from theIllinois definition of fish and wildlife habitat. The Illinois definitionis the same as the Federal definition and therefore is consistent.  13. The FWS requested that a definition of ``subsidence'' be added to theIllinois program because of the impact on surface land and water. Illinoishas determined that it is not necessary to include a definition of thisterm. The protection of land and water is assured by other regulationsin the Illinois program. The lack of a definition for ``substance'' isnot inconsistent with Federal regulations.  14. The FWS commented that ``threatened and endangered species'' shouldbe defined and the relationship between Federal and State listed and proposedspecies explained. OSMRE believes that the term ``threatened and endangeredspecies'' is well defined by other Federal and State laws and regulationswhich are referenced by both Illinois and the Federal rules and thereforeneed not be included in the Illinois regulations.  The explanation of the relationship between Federal and State endangeredspecies is contained in the Interagency Agreement between the regulatoryauthority and the Illinois Department of Conservation. This agreement ispart of the approved State regulatory program.  15. The FWS asked that a definition of ``wetlands'' be included in theresubmitted Illinois regulations. The Federal regulations do not includethis definition and therefore the lack of a wetland definition is not inconsistentwith the Federal rules.  16. The FWS requested that endangered species determinations and culturalresource areas be added to resubmitted Illinois regulation 1761.11(b) relatingto lands unsuitable for mining. Section 1761.11(c) references historicalresources. Endangered species protection is provided by other sectionsof the Illinois program. The regulations as submitted are consistent withthe Federal rules.  17. The FWS commented on resubmitted Illinois regulations 1761.15(a) and(b), which deal with the processing of lands unsuitable petitions. Theconcern was expressed that, unless there was an imminent threat or miningapplication on file, a petition would not be considered. The Illinois programprovides that any petition which is deemed complete, is not frivolous andconcerns an area with identified coal resources will be processed.   18. The FWS requested that resubmitted regulation 1772.12(b)(12) be revisedto require identification of endangered species habitat in addition tocritical habitat and cultural resources. The Federal counterpart, 30 CFR772.12(b)(12), requires only critical habitat identification. The Illinoisregulation is therefore consistent with the Federal rule. Cultural resourcesare required to be described in Illinois regulation 1772.12(b)(8) and neednot be included in 1772.12(b)(12).  19. The FWS asked for clarification of Illinois regulation 1772.12(d)(2)(B)which requires that IDMM find in writing that the applicant for an explorationpermit has demonstrated that the proposed operation will not jeopardizethe continued existence of an endangered or threatened species or resultin destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat. Resubmitted1772.(d)(2)(B) is exactly the same as 30 CFR 772.12(d)(2)(ii) and is thereforeconsistent. No clarification is required.20. The FWS requested that Executive Orders 11988 and 11990, the CleanWater Act and the Archeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 be addedto Illinois section 1773.12, which concerns permit coordination. Theselaws are not specifically included in the Federal counterpart, 30 CFR 733.12,and are therefore not required in the State program, although the Statemust of course comply with any applicable provisions, as stated in thegeneral language of Illinois rule 1773.12.21. The FWS commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1773.15(c) requiresthe State to find in writing that the direct, indirect, and comulativeimpacts of the proposed permit action on fish and wildlife resources andtheir habitats and wetlands have been adequately and properly mitigated.Resubmitted 1773.15(c) contains the required finding of the Federal counterpart,30 CFR 773.15(c); therefore, the suggested language is not required.22. The FWS requested that insignificant revisions as described in resubmittedregulation 1774.13(b) be subject to Federal agency review to determinethe affect on Federal laws, rules and regulations and that such revisionswhich impact Federal lands also be subject to Federal review. Consistentwith Federal regulations, Illinois has provided guidelines as to the scaleor extent of revisions for which all permit application information andrequirements shall apply. Insignificant revisions by their definition donot require the review suggested. The Illinois regulation is consistentwith the Federal rules.23. The FWS requested that a requirement be added to resubmitted Part 1779describing diversions. Part 1779 and the Federal counterpart, 30 CFR Part779, define the minimum requirements for information on environmental resourcesincluding the location of surface water bodies such as streams, lakes,ponds, springs, constructed or natural drains and ditches within the proposedpermit and adjacent areas. Information concerning diversions would be includedin the required information. Resubmitted Part 1779 is consistent with 30CFR Part 779.24. The FWS commented that the fish and wildlife description required byresubmitted 1779.20 should discuss the conditions existing before the currentconditions were changed to allow for mining (within the last five years).In addition, the FWS stated that that information, including a descriptionof listed and proposed threatened or endangered species, should be thebaseline for the plan developed under 1780.16. Resubmitted 1779.20 includesthe information required by former 30 CFR 779.20. Any additional requirements,resulting from the December 11, 1987 revisions to the Federal rule willbe addressed in a separate letter from the Director.25. The FWS commented that land use information required by resubmitted1779.22 should include wildlife habitat and recreational uses as well asagricultural aspects. Resubmitted 1779.22 is consistent with 30 CFR 779.22.26. The FWS commented that maps submitted in accordance with 1779.24 shouldidentify public lands, wetlands, natural areas and wildlife areas. Resubmitted1779.24 is consistent with 30 CFR 779.24.27. The FWS commented that the phrase ``where practicable'' in 1780.16(a)(1)is not appropriate. Resubmitted 1780.16(a)(1) is identical to 30 CFR 780.16(a)(1)and is therefore consistent.28. The FWS commented that wetlands should be added to the list of waterareas in 1779.25(a)(7). Resubmitted 1779.25(a)(7) is consistent with 30CFR 779.25(a)(7).29. The FWS commented that threatened or endangered species should be separatedfrom 1780.16(b) as there are special requirements for these species andan endangered species permit may be required before work can be done. Resubmitted1780.16(b) is consistent with the Federal counterpart.30. The FWS commented that the term ``enhancement'' needs to be definedin 1780.16(a)(2). Use of the term ``enhancement'' in resubmitted 1780.16(a)(2)is identical to 30 CFR 780.16(a)(2) and is not inconsistent with the Federalregulations.31. The FWS requested in relation to 1780.23 that all pre-mining land usesincluding wildlife habitat and recreation be considered. The FWS also statedthat Federal laws, rules, policies, etc. should be considered in conjunctionwith State and local land use plans. Resubmitted 1780.23 is consistentwith 30 CFR 780.23.32. The FWS requested that wetlands and riparian habitat be added to thelist of waters and adjacent areas in 1780.25. Resubmitted 1780.25 is consistentwith 30 CFR 780.25.33. The FWS suggested that the reference to ``surface'' coal mining operationsin 1783.12(a) is confusing and noted that the section makes no mentionof surface impacts from underground mining such as subsidence. Resubmitted1783.12(a), dealing with general environmental resources information forunderground mining permit applications, is consistent with 30 CFR 783.12(a).Additional information regarding subsidence is required by 1784.20.34. The FWS commented that 1783.20(a) should include a description of areasexpected to be impacted by subsidence. Resubmitted 1783.20(a) is consistentwith 30 CFR 783.20(a).35. The FWS requested in relation to 1783.20(a) that the Service be includedin the review of mining on, under and adjacent to Federal lands and waters.Resubmitted 1783.20(c) requires the regulatory authority to consult withthe Illinois Department of Conservation (IDOC). IDOC is obligated to consultand coordinate with the FWS on a routine basis about what is required inpermit applications. Resubmitted 1783.20(c) is not inconsistent with 30CFR 783.20(c).36. The FWS commented that productivity for wildlife and recreation shouldbe included in the information required by 1783.22(a)(2)(B). Resubmitted1783.22(a)(2)(B) is identical to 30 CFR 783.22(a)(2)(ii).37. The FWS commented that maps submitted in accordance with 1783.24 shouldidentify public lands, wetlands, natural areas and wildlife areas. Resubmitted1783.24 is consistent with 30 CFR 783.24.38. The FWS commented that a requirement should be added to 1784.13 todiscuss plans for fish and wildlife habitat. Resubmitted 1784.13 is consistentwith counterpart 30 CFR 784.13.39. The FWS commented in relation to 1784.16 that wetlands may be designedin the plan or may occur in time as some of the mentioned water bodiesage. Resubmitted 1784.16 is not inconsistent with 30 CFR 784.16.40. The FWS made numerous comments and suggestions concerning 1784.20(e).Resubmitted 1784.20(e) is identical to its counterpart at 30 CFR 784.20(e)and is therefore consistent with the Federal regulation.41. The FWS made numerous comments and suggestions concerning 1784.23.Resubmitted 1784.23 is consistent with Federal counterpart 30 CFR 784.23.42. The FWS commented in reference to 1785.13(b)(2) that wildlife and recreationaluse other than recreational facilities could be post-mining uses. Resubmitted1785.13(b)(2) is identical to 30 CFR 785.13(b)(2).43. The FWS commented in reference to 1785.14(c)(1) that wildlife and recreationaluse other than recreational facilities could be post-mining land uses.Resubmitted 1785.14(c)(1) is consistent with 30 CFR 785.14(c)(1).44. The FWS commented in reference to 1785.16(a)(1) that wildlife and recreationaluse other than recreational facilities could be post-mining land uses.Resubmitted 1785.16(a)(1) is consistent with 30 CFR 785.16(a)(1).45. The FWS commented that the map and aerial photographs required by 1785.23(c)(4)should show the location of fields and fences and the various types andsizes/ages of vegetation and recreational land uses. Current 1785.23(c)(4)is not being changed and therefore is not part of this rulemaking.46. The FWS indicated that Sections 1816.116 and 1817.116, as referencedby Section 1800.13(a), were not included in the review document. The FWSalso commented that a minimum five-year period of responsibility shouldbe required for grasses and herbaceous vegetation, with a minimum of 50years for woody vegetation. Amended Sections 1816.116 and 1817.116 wereapproved by OSMRE on December 10, 1986 (51 FR 44454). Resubmitted 1800.13(a)is consistent with Federal regulations.47. The FWS commented in relation to 1815.15(a) that no threatened or endangeredspecies or their habitats may be affected prior to consultation. Resubmitted1815.15(a) is identical to 30 CFR 815.15(a).48. The FWS commented in reference to 1815.15(f) that wetlands and theirwatersheds should not be affected and unavoidable impacts should be properlyand adequately mitigated. Resubmitted 1815.15(f) is consistent with Federalregulation 30 CFR 815.15(f).49. The FWS indicated that Parts 1816.111 through 1816.132 are shown inthe Section 1816 index but not included in the review document. These sectionsare not part of this rulemaking.50. The FWS made two comments in reference to 1816.43. First, the slopesof diversion banks should be at a grade that supports vegetation to controlerosion and the regulation should be expanded to assure that operatorsdesign and maintain vegetated slopes that prevent soil erosion and pollutionof receiving waters except for sedimentation/silt basins that keep sedimentationon-site. Second, any diversions of flows that affect wetlands shall beidentified and described and provisions should be made to mitigate foradverse impacts. OSMRE has determined that resubmitted 1816.43 is virtuallyidentical to the Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 816.43 and is thereforeno less effective.51. The FWS commented that it assumes that the retaining structures forthe impoundments, ponds, etc. referred to in 1816.56 would have to complywith Federal safety requirements for such structures. Resubmitted 1816.56is identical to 30 CFR 816.56.52. The FWS commented in reference to 1816.71(a) that excess spoil shouldnot be placed in wetlands and if no feasible and prudent alternatives tospoil placement in wetlands exist, the area to be affected should be fullydescribed, and an adequate mitigation plan be included in the reclamationplan to assure restoration and maintenance of wetland habitat. Resubmitted1816.71(a) is identical to 30 CFR 816.71(a).53. The FWS commented on 1816.72 about loss of wildlife habitat in headof hollow fills. State Section 1816.72 is consistent with 30 CFR 816.72.Wildlife habitat is not discussed in the Federal section.54. The FWS commented on 1816.83 on coal mine waste placed in wetlandsand reducing the maximum final grade slopes to less than 50 percent. Statesection 1816.83 is consistent with 30 CFR 816.83.55. The FWS commented on 1816.97(a) and (b) on adequate mitigation to fishand wildlife and their habitats in the reclamation plan. State rules 1816.97(a)and (b) are consistent with 30 CFR 816.97(a) and (b) in that the reclamationplan is not discussed.56. The FWS commented on 1816.97(c) and (d) that all protected speciesshould be listed not just eagles. State rules 1816.97(c) and (d) are consistentwith 30 CFR 816.97(c) and (d), which specifically concern the protectionof eagles.57. The FWS commented that the words ``wildlife habitat'' should be addedto the first sentence of 1816.97(f) and the second sentence should be deleted.State rule 1816.97(f) is consistent with 30 CFR 816.97(f).58. The FWS commented that Sections 1817.111 through 1817.117 were notincluded in the rules submission. Sections 1817.111 through 1817.117 werenot part of the submission package because they have not been revised.59. The FWS commented on section 1817.43(a)(2)(C) on diversions must bedesigned to properly maintain a quality environment. State rule 1817.43(a)(2)(C)is consistent with 30 CFR 817.43(a)(2)(iii).60. The FWS commented on section 1817.46(b)(6) on the need for vegetativestandards for retained sediment ponds. State rule 1817.46(b)(6) is consistentwith 30 CFR 817.46(b)(6), which contains no separate vegetative standards.61. The FWS commented on section 1817.46(e)(1) on using regular water monitoringto show that an exemption from sediment control is permissible. State rule1817.46(e)(1) granting sediment pond exemptions is consistent with 30 CFR817.46(e)(1).62. The FWS commented on section 1817.49 that structures such as dikesand dams should meet Federal safety standards. State rule 1817.49 is consistentwith 30 CFR 817.49.63. The FWS commented on section 1817.57 that consultation under Section7 of the Threatened and Endangered Species Act may be necessary if a threatenedor endangered species may be affected within a stream buffer zone. Statesection 1817.57 is consistent with 30 CFR 817.57.64. The FWS commented on 1817.71 that excess spoil should not be placedin wetlands. State rule 1817.71 is consistent with 30 CFR 817.71.65. The FWS commented on 1817.72 on loss of wildlife habitat in head ofhollow fills. State section 1817.72 is consistent with 30 CFR 817.72. 66. The FWS referred to comments made on section 1816.73. No comments weremade on Section 1816.73. 67. The FWS commented on section 1817.81 that waste should not be depositedin wetlands. State section 1817.81 is consistent with 30 CFR 817.81. 68. The FWS commented on section 1817.83 about coal mine waste placed inwetlands and reducing the maximum final grade slopes to less than 50 percent.State section 1817.83 is consistent with 30 CFR 817.83. 69. The FWS commented on 1817.97(a) and (b) on adequate mitigation to fishand wildlife and their habitats in the reclamation plan. State rules 1817.97(a)and (b) are consistent with 30 CFR 1817.97(a) and (b). 70. The FWS commented on 1817.97(c) and (d) that all protected speciesshould be listed not just eagles. State rules 1817.97(c) and (d) are consistentwith 30 CFR 817.97(c) and (d) which specifically concern the protectionof eagles. 71. The FWS commented on 1817.97(f) that the words ``wildlife habitat''should be added to the first sentence and the second sentence should bedeleted. State rule 1817.97(f) is consistent with 30 CFR 817.97(f). 72. The FWS questioned 1817.121(c)(1) as to which agency is responsiblefor the determination of technical and economic feasibility. The agencythat issues the permit would be the responsible agency. State rule 1817.121(c)(1)is consistent with the 30 CFR 817.121(c)(1). 73. The FWS commented on 1817.121(c)(2) that the need to protect the vegetativeand productive capability of the land as well as the use of insurance maynot adequately compensate the owner. State rule 1817.121(c)(2) is consistentwith 30 CFR 817.121(c)(2). Vegetative and productive capability of theland is addressed in 1817.121(c)(1). 74. The FWS questioned if the State will provide OSMRE with an annual reportunder section 1840.2. There is no Federal rule comparable to 1840.2. Thissection gives the State authority to have the operator provide reportsand data and is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations. 75. The FWS commented on section 1843.11 on a cessation order for learningof the presence of an endangered species and mining without a valid permit.State section 1843.11 is consistent with 30 CFR 843.11. Public Comments As an initial and general matter, ISP argued that, since Illinois madesubstantial changes between the first submission to OSMRE on March 28,1986, and the resubmission on May 22, 1987, the State should have beenrequired to reopen the comment period. The Director finds that this comment is misdirected since OSMRE has nojurisdiction over procedural aspects of State rulemaking activities. OSMREhas fully complied with all Federal public participation requirements of30 CFR 732.17 and the Administrative Procedure Act by opening a publiccomment period and providing an opportunity for a public hearing on eachof the State submissions. Summaries of all public comments received and the Director's responsesto them appear below: 1. ISP stated that the Department's proposed definition of ``cemetery''should be changed to read ``cemetery means any area of land where humanbodies are interred.'' In the regulation resubmitted on May 22, 1987, Illinoisrevised the definition as suggested. 2. ISP stated that the Department's proposed definition of ``coal processingplant'' must be revised to include coal crushing and sizing facilities.Illinois changed the term being defined to ``coal preparation plant'' andrevised the definition to include the cleaning, concentrating, or otherprocessing or preparation of coal. Illinois also deleted all referencesto the seperation of coal from its impurities. As revised, the Illinoisdefinition is similar to and consistent with the Federal definition at30 CFR 701.5. 3. ISP stated that Illinois must adopt a definition of ``road'' consistentwith the corresponding Federal definition at 30 CFR 701.5. Illinois chosenot to do so since the Federal definition has been suspended followingits remand in <T3>In re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulation Litigation (II) </T3>(D.D.C.,October 1, 1984). Illinois need not define this term in the absence ofa Federal definition. 4. ISP claimed that the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbiastruck down the ``takings'' test in the Federal definition of ``valid existingrights'' and that Illinois therefore must adopt a definition relying ona ``mechanical'' test. OSMRE notes that the court remanded the Federaldefinition of ``valid existing rights'' at 30 CFR 761.5 on procedural groundswithout ruling on its consistency with SMCRA. Furthermore, in its March30, 1988, decision in <T3>ISP </T3>v. <T3>Hodel, </T3>the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruledthat, while the Director could not approve a State rule based on the remandedFederal definition, it was not clear that reimposition of the mechanicaltest would automatically follow. As discussed in finding 2(b), the Director is deferring a decision on theproposed Illinois definition and he is requesting additional comment onwhether the takings test is no less effective than the mechanical tests.5. ISP commented that Illinois must also amend 62 IAC 1761.11(c) to protectall places listed on the National Register of Historic Places, not justthose that are publicly owned. As discussed in Finding 4(b), the Directoris disapproving the language limiting protection of sites listed on theRegister to those that are publicly owned.6. ISP commented that the current language of 1761.12(c)(2) should notbe amended since it then would be unclear how the public could learn thata mining operation is proposed to be conducted within 100 feet of a publicroad. OSMRE notes that resubmitted 1761.12(c)(2) now requires public noticein a newspaper of general circulation in the affected area, as does 30CFR 761.12. The newspaper notice ensures that the public has adequate opportunityto become aware of proposed mining operations within 100 feet of a publicroad. 7. ISP stated that proposed 1764.15(a)(7), which refers to suspended petitions,should be deleted since proposed 1764.15(a)(3) does not provide for suspensionof petitions. Illinois' resubmitted amendments do not include 764.15(a)(7).8. ISP stated that proposed 1764.17(a)(1) should be amended to providefor cross-examination of expert witnesses only at public hearings for thedesignation of areas unsuitable for surface coal mining. OSMRE notes thatthe cross-examination provided for in 1764.17(a)(1) is acceptable sinceit is required by sections 7.03 and 8.09 of the State Act and was approvedin the original approval of the State program and upheld on appeal in <T3>ISP v. Hodel, </T3>supra. As documented in the Administrative Record,the IDMM generally would not cross-examine lay witnesses. 9. ISP recommended that proposed 1764.19(b) which provides the Departmentwith options in designating areas unsuitable for surface mining shouldbe deleted. OSMRE notes that 1764.19(b) clearly establishes that the Departmentmay decide to designate the petitioned land in whole or in part, not designatethe petitioned land or to place conditions on future operations. The provisionallowing for conditions is consistent with the discretion afforded by theFederal regulations.  10. ISP commented that the phrase ``and which may substantially disturbthe land surface'' contained in proposed 1772.11(a) for coal explorationfor less than 250 tons should be deleted. Revised 1772.11(a) as resubmittedby Illinois no longer contains the phrase.  11. ISP commented that the phrase ``other specific description'' containedin proposed 1772.11(b)(3) needs clarification. OSMRE notes that 30 CFR772.11(b)(3) which requires the notice to include a narrative or map describingthe exploration area was suspended insofar as it allows a notice to besubmitted which does not include a narrative describing the explorationarea (See 51 FR 41961, Nov. 20, 1986). OSMRE finds Illinois' requirementfor other specific descriptions consistent with the suspension and thecurrent Federal rules.12. ISP stated that proposed 1773.13(a)(1)(D) establishing certain noticerequirements should be expanded to identify the location where writtenrequests for public hearings on applications may be submitted. Revised1773.13(a)(1)(D) as resubmitted includes where to submit requests for publichearings. 13. ISP stated that proposed subsection 1774.13(b)(2)(iv) granting exceptionsto significant revisions should be repealed since it goes beyond that allowedunder section 511 of SMCRA. OSMRE disagrees and reaffirms its finding inthe original program approval and pursuant to the Remand Order. 30 CFR774.13(b)(2) and section 511(a)(2) of SMCRA provide that the regulatoryauthority (State) shall establish guidelines for determining the scaleor extent of a revision request for which all permit application informationrequirements and procedures, including notice and hearings, shall apply.Illinois' exceptions in 1774.13(b)(2)(D) have not changed in this rulemakingand are consistent with the Federal rules.14. ISP stated that proposed 1778.15(d), which allows attorney's statementsto suffice for right of entry documents, should be expanded to cover theright to subside in the shadow area. Illinois has revised 1778.15(d) byclarifying that the attorney statement may cover the legal right to enterand commence surface coal mining and reclamation operations proposed inthe application. This includes planned subsidence operations as made explicitin 1778.15(a).15. ISP commented that the term ``surface mining activities'' as used inproposed 1778.16(c) needs to be defined. In resubmitted 1778.16(c), Illinoisuses the term ``surface coal mining operations,'' which is defined. OSMREfinds this term and definition identical to the term and definition inthe Federal regulations at 30 CFR 701.5.16. ISP stated that Illinois must include an air quality monitoring programto provide sufficient data to evaluate the effectiveness of the fugitivedust control practices. Illinois states that 30 CFR 780.15(b) providesfor an air quality monitoring program only if required by the regulatoryauthority. Illinois has opted to not require such programs. OSMRE agreeswith Illinois that air quality monitoring programs under 30 CFR 780.15(b)(1)are left to the discretion of the regulatory authority.17. ISP and EPA commented that 1780.21(f) and 1784.14(e) concerning determinationsof probable hydrologic consequences must include the specific requirementsof 30 CFR 780.21(f) (1), (2), (3) and (4) and 784.14(e) (1), (2), (3),and (4), respectively. OSMRE is requiring Illinois to revise 1780.21(f)and 1784.13(e) to be no less effective than the Federal rules. See Finding14(f).18. ISP commented that the first sentence in proposed 1780.21(i)(2) and1784.14(h)(2) should be changed to show that there will not be adverseimpacts anywhere within the cumulative hydrologic impact area. ISP pointsout that the Federal rule was remanded by Judge Flannery (<T3>In Re: Permanent Surface Mining Regulations Litigation II,</T3> C.A.No. 79-1144, D.D.C. 1984). OSMRE notes the language proposed by the Stateis not the same as that remanded by the Court. The State indicates in theAdministrative Record that it will consider whether an impact is appreciablebefore waiving the requirement for ground water monitoring. OSMRE is approvingthe regulation but notes that the Department must not grant a waiver unlessthe aquifer does not significantly ensure the hydrologic balance withinthe cumulative impact area. Illinois also indicates it will promulgatea new rule on this subject, if necessary, after a new regulation is promulgatedby OSMRE. 19. ISP commented that the phrase ``to the extent information is availableto identify tile drainage fields'' should be deleted in proposed 1783.24(e)dealing with maps. Illinois deleted the phrase in its resubmitted 1783.24(e)so that drainage fields must be identified even when such information isnot available. 20. ISP commented that the phrase ``including surface and underground agriculturaldrainage systems'' should be retained in Section 1784.20. ISP noted thatsurface and subsurface agricultural drainage systems should be includedunder all protections granted to structures. Resubmitted 1784.20 has beenrevised by Illinois to retain the phrase. Illinois stated that agriculturaldrainage systems, as structures, have always been afforded identificationand protection. 21. ISP commented that current Subsection 1784.20(c) should be retainedin addition to proposed Subsection 1784.20(c). ISP stated that Illinoisshould not delete the requirement that the applicant give a detailed descriptionin its permit application of the measures to be taken to mitigate the effectsof subsidence because people who are going to be undermined should be giventhe opportunity to comment on such plans. Illinois, however, notes that in order for a permit applicant to satisfythe requirements of Subsection 1784.20(f), it is necessary to describemeasures to be taken in accordance with Section 1817.12(c), which outlinesmitigation measures that are required. In this regard Illinois states thatthe revised regulations do not differ from the requirements of the previousregulations. Both 1784.20(c) and 1784.20(f) are consistent with the Federalregulations and therefore acceptable. 22. ISP commented that current Subsection 1784.20(d) should be retainedin addition to proposed Subsection 1784.20(d). ISP noted that operatorswill take measures to determine the amount of subsidence damage for whichthey are responsible before they begin correcting such damage and the publicshould be given opportunity to review and comment on these measures duringthe permit application review. A detailed description of such measuresis not required by the Federal regulations. However, Illinois believessuch measures are necessary in order to assure that mitigation is fullyachieved, and 1784.20(f) now contains such a requirement. OSMRE finds that1784.20(f) is consistent with the Federal regulations. 23. ISP commented that deleted Subsection 1784.20b(3)(A-D) should be retained.These subsections required descriptions of measures to be taken on thesurface to prevent damage. OSMRE, however, notes that for areas of plannedsubsidence such descriptions of preventive measures are not required bythe Federal regulations. Illinois regulations 1784.20 (e) and (f) pertainingto descriptions of anticipated subsidence and measures to be taken to mitigateor remedy the effects of subsidence are consistent with 30 CFR 784.20 (e)and (f). 24. ISP commented that 30 CFR 785.16, which the proposed Illinois rulemirrors, was remanded by the District Court in<T3> In Re: Permanent, supra.</T3> ISP noted that the court found thatSMCRA only allows approximate original contour (AOC) variances for steepslope mining. Resubmitted Illinois rule 1785.16 now establishes that AOCvariances can only be obtained for steep slope mountaintop removal mining.OSMRE finds 1785.16 consistent with the Federal regulations. 25. ISP commented that proposed 1785.17(a) should be revised to apply clearlyto both surface mining and the surface effects of underground operations.Resubmitted Illinois rule 1785.17(a) clarifies that the rule applies tosurface coal mining and reclamation operations, which include the surfaceeffects of underground operations on prime farmlands and is therefore consistentwith the 30 CFR 785.17(a). 26. ISP commented that proposed 1785.17(b)(1) pertaining to prime farmlandreconnaissance inspections should be revised to require consultation withthe U.S. Soil Conservation Service consistent with 30 CFR 785.17(b). Illinoisadded the requirement to resubmitted 1785.17(b)(1). 27. ISP commented that proposed and resubmitted 1800.11(b)(1) should bechanged to require the bond to cover the entire permit area upon whichthe operator will initiate and conduct surface coal mining operations duringthe initial term of the permit. ISP's comment is based on the U.S. DistrictCourt's remand in<T3> In Re: Permanent, supra </T3>of the Federal rule at 30 CFR 800.11(b),which allowed bonding of increments smaller than the entire area to bemined within the initial term of the permit. OSMRE notes that the DistrictCourt's ruling was reversed by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Districtof Columbia Circuit in an opinion dated January 29, 1988. The opinion statedthat incremental and phased bonding, as allowed by 30 CFR 800.11(b) and800.13(a)(2) are acceptable. Illinois 1800.11(b) is substantively identicalto 30 CFR 800.11(b) and is therefore consistent. 28. ISP commented that Illinois regulation 1800.13(a)(2) allows operatorsto post a bond that would guarantee only specific phases of reclamationwithin the permit area and the U.S. District Court rejected such phasedbonding. Resubmitted Illinois regulations no longer contain 1800.13(a)(2).However, as noted above, the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed the DistrictCourt with regard to phased bonding. 29. ISP commented that a provision should be added to 1800.15 requiringthe Department to adjust the amount of bond required to be posted by theoperator if material damage to the land or structures results from subsidence.Illinois rule 1800.15 is virtually the same as, and no less effective than,30 CFR 800.15 which establishes provision for the adjustment of the amountof bond. Therefore 1800.15 is consistent with 30 CFR 800.15. 30. ISP commented that proposed rule 1800.21 should be amended to includeprovision for real property to be posted as collateral bond. Illinois,however, notes that it is opposed to bonds which may require time and effortto convert to cash and has therefore not provided for real property collateralbonds. This is consistent with 30 CFR 800.21. 31. ISP commented that proposed 1800.50(a) dealing with forfeiture of bondsshould be changed to require forfeiture of the bond for the entire permitarea. The Federal counterpart allows for partial or incremental forfeitureand thus Illinois 1800.50(a) is consistent with 30 CFR 800.50(a). 32. ISP commented that proposed 1800.50(f) should be deleted since it allowsoperators who have forfeited bond to be issued future permits if the landfor which the bond has been forfeited has been reclaimed without cost tothe State. Illinois notes that section 6.07(e) of the State Act providesthat any operator against whom forfeiture proceedings have been requiredshall not be issued a permit for further mining in Illinois unless he providesassurances satisfactory to the Department that such proceedings will notagain become necessary. The assurances satisfactory to the Department areset forth in section 1800.50(f) of this regulation and as resubmitted nowrequire all prior violations to the State Act attributable to the permitapplicant to have been corrected. OSMRE finds this provision consistentwith the Federal regulations. 33. ISP commented that proposed 1815.15(d) should be revised to requiretopsoil to be removed, stored and redistributed on areas disturbed by coalexploration activitites as necessary to assure successful revegetation.30 CFR 815.15(d) requires topsoil to be removed, stored and redistributedas necessary to assure successful revegetation or as required by the regulatoryauthority. Illinois 1815.15(d) specifies removal unless the operator candemonstrate that topsoil will not be affected by excessive erosion, compactionand contamination. Illinois 1815.15(d) also specifies what must be demonstratedas required in 30 CFR 815.15(d) and is therefore consistent with the Federalrule. 34. ISP commented that 1816.22(a)(2) and 1817.22(a)(2) should be changedto require that, if topsoil is less than six inches thick, the operatorshall remove a six-inch layer that includes the A horizon and the unconsolidatedmaterials immediately below or the A horizon and all unconsolidated materialif the total available is less than six inches and treat the mixture astopsoil. Resubmitted Illinois regulations 1816.22(a)(2) and 1817.22(a)(2)have been revised to require that at least six inches of top material beremoved unless a substitute or supplement is approved. Revised 1816.22(a)(2)and 1817.22(a)(2) are thus consistent with and no less effective than theFederal regulations. 35. ISP commented that proposed rules 1816.22(a)(3) and 1817.22(a)(3) shouldbe changed to read: ``The Department may choose not to require the removalof topsoil for minor disturbances . . .'' The suggested change would makethe Illinois regulations identical to 30 CFR 816.22(a)(3) and 817.22(a)(3).Illinois has chosen to retain the proposed version which establishes thatthe Department will not require the removal of topsoil for minor disturbances.The Federal rules allow topsoil on areas of minor disturbances not to besaved. OSMRE finds the Illinois choice consistent with the Federal regulations.36. ISPO commented that proposed 1816.22(a)(3)(B) and 1817.22(a)(3)(B)should be revised to include the phrase ``and will not degrade the qualityor limit the future use of the soil''. Illinois has added the phrase toresubmitted 1816.22(a)(3)(B) and 1817.22(a)(3)(B). 37. ISP commented that 1816.22(a)(4) and 1817.22(a)(4) should be changedto require that all material to be removed shall be removed after the vegetativecover that would interfere with its use is cleared. Illinois rules areexactly the same as the Federal rules in this case and no change is necessary.38. ISP commented that 1816.22(b) and 1817.22(b) governing topsoil substitutesshould be revised to clarify that plans for topsoil substitutes or supplementsmust be considered significant revisions subject to the public review provisionof 1773 and 1774. ISP also indicated that the former Illinois languageat 1816.22(e) which is being repealed should be included to describe whatproof will be required for the Department to approve a topsoil substitutionplan. Resubmitted 1816.22(b) and 1817.22(b) have been revised to specifythat, when the extent of area of topsoil substitute or supplement is lessthan ten percent of the permit area or 50 acres, whichever is less, andthe land is not prime farmland, then the change can be considered an insignificantpermit revision. The regulations now also specify that the demonstrationshall be based on that required pursuant to 1774.13(b)(2) and 1784.13(b)(4).Thus resubmitted regulations are consistent with the Federal regulations.39. ISP commented that proposed 1816.22(c)(2)(C) and 1817.22(c)(2)(C) governingprotection of stockpiled materials should be revised by deleting or defining``or through other measures approved by the Department.'' ISP says theDepartment must provide the criteria it will use to evaluate other measures.In its resubmitted 1816.22(c)(2)(C) and 1817.22(c)(2)(C) Illinois has addedthe wording ``equally effective in controlling erosion'' to clarify thatother measures will be judged compared to vegetation for controlling soilloss from stockpiles. Illinois stated that such examples might includeheavy mulching, berms and chemical binders which also control soil loss.OSMRE finds 1816.22(c)(2)(C) and 1817.22(c)(2)(C) consistent with the Federalregulations. 40. ISP commented that proposed 1816.22(c)(3) and 1817.22(c)(3), whichallow materials removed under paragraph (a)(1) to be temporarily distributedat an approved site, should be deleted. ISP acknowledged that the proposedregulations mirrored Federal regulations but claimed the practice was unproven.Illinois has regained the provision and explains in the AdministrativeRecord that the regulations provide adequate consideration for trade-offsbetween long-term stockpiling and thinner activity managed distributionfor agriculture. OSMRE finds the State provision consistent with Federalregulations. 41. ISP commented that proposed 1816.41(c)(1) and 1817.41(c)(1) pertainingto gound water monitoring should be changed to require additional monitoring.In resubmitted 1816.41(c)(1) and 1817.41(c)(1) Illinois has added ``Ifunanticipated conditions develop, or if any approved operation or reclamationplan is modified or revised such that the current monitoring program wouldnot detect possible adverse impacts to the hydrologic balance as a resultof the change, then the Department shall require additional monitoring.''Thus, Illinois has clarified when additional monitoring shall be required.These provisions are consistent with the Federal regulations. 42. ISP commented that proposed 1816.41(c)(2) and 1817.41(c)(2) shouldbe revised to require that a water violation be reported in 24 hours insteadof five days as proposed. Resubmitted 1816.41(c)(2) provides exactly thesame reporting requirement as the Federal rule in this case and no changeis necessary. 43. ISP commented that proposed 1816.41(e)(1) should be changed to read``* * * the Department shall require additional monitoring * * *''; andthe word ``neceessary''' should be deleted at the end of the subsection.Resubmitted 1816.41(e)(1) has incorporated these changes, which are consistentwith the Federal regulations. 44. ISP commented that proposed 1816.41(e)(2) and 1817.41(e)(2) shouldbe revised to require the reporting of a violation within 24 hours. Under30 CFR 816.41(e)(2) and 817.41(e)(2), where the analysis of any surfacewater sample indicates non-compliance with the permit conditions, the operatorshall promptly notify the regulatory authority. Illinois has retained fivedays for its time limit. The Department states that five days, which wasthe time in the existing regulations, has worked well. OSMRE finds the``within five days'' requirements consistent with the Federal regulationwhich requires prompt notification. 45. ISP commented that proposed 1816.41(g) and 1817.41(g) should be changedto read ``with prior approval of the Department, wells may be transferredto the surface owner of the lands where the well is located for futureuse.'' Resubmitted 1816.41(g) and 1817.41(g) have addressed this concernand are the same as 30 CFR 816.41(g) and 817.41(g).46. ISP commented with regard to 1816.41(i)(1)(c) and 1817.41(h)(1)(c)that, if the Department is going to allow exemptions to pH and suspendedsolids limits, the language ``* * * so long as they will not result inany adverse impacts to the hydrologic balance * * *'' should be maintainedat a minimum. ISP also commented the Department must adopt standards ofproof that will be required for making a ``no adverse impact'' finding.30 CFR 816.41(i)(1)(iii) allows pH and total suspended-solids limitationsto be exceeded if approved by the regulatory authority. Resubmitted Illinoisrules 1816.41(i)(1)(c) and 1817.41(h)(1)(c) allow these limitations tobe exceeded as long as they will not result in any adverse impacts to thehydrologic balance. Thus the resubmitted rules are consistent with theFederal rules. 47. ISP commented that the scope of rules 1816.43(a)(3) and 1817.43(a)(3)must be clarified because the Illinois rules refer to restoration of permanentdiversions or stream channels prior to removal of temporary diversionswhereas 30 CFR 816.43(a)(3) and 817.43(a)(3) refer to restoration of permanentdiversions or stream channels after removal of temporary diversions. Resubmittedrules 1816.43(a)(3) and 1817.43(a)(3) use the word ``prior'' to emphasizethat all permanent diversions or stream channels are to be establishedbefore removal of temporary structures, which is consistent with the Federalrules. 48. ISP commented that proposed rules 1816.43(a)(4)(A) and 1817.43(a)(4)(A)refer to existing 1816.72(b)(4) and its counterpart in 1817, which havebeen deleted in the proposed rules. Resubmitted rules 1816.43(a)(4)(A)and 1817.43(a)(4)(A) have deleted references to existing 1816.72(b)(4)and its counterpart in 1817 and they are consistent with the Federal rules.  49. ISP commented that proposed rules 1816.43(a)(5) and 1817.43(a)(5) mustbe changed to include protection from additional flooding outside the permitarea or damage to crops and other vegetation because the purpose of thediversion standards is to prevent adverse impacts off-site as well as inthe permit area. Language found in current sections 1816.43(h) and 1817.43(h)has been placed in section 1816.43(a)(5) and 1817.43(a)(5) in the resubmittedregulations. The language is specific in that the public health or environmentmay not be endangered. In addition, resubmitted regulations 1816.43(a)(1)and 1817.43(a)(1) require that diversions be designed to prevent materialdamage outside the permit area and resubmitted regulations 1816.43(a)(2)and 1817.43(a)(2) require that diversions protect against flooding andresultant damage to life and property. These regulations provide sufficientrequirements to prevent adverse off-site impacts and they are consistentwith Federal rules. 50. ISP commented that the phrase ``and will not require maintenance''should be substituted for ``will require infrequent maintenance'' in proposedrules 1816.43(b)(4) and 1817.43(b)(4). Resubmitted rules 1816.43(b)(4)and 1817.43(b)(4) have deleted the phrase ``will require infrequent maintenance''and require that the longitudinal profile of the stream, the channel, andthe floodplain be designed and constructed to remain stable. OSMRE findsthese changes to be consistent with the Federal rules. 51. ISP commented that proposed and resubmitted rules 1816.46(b)(7) and1817.46(b)(8) should be deleted because they have no Federal counterpartand the proposed use of sediment ponds as an alternate post-mining landuse violates the letter and intent of the Federal and State Acts and doesnot make good sense as a method for preventing soil erosion. OSMRE notes,however, that retention of sediment ponds can serve to enhance the post-miningenvironment by helping to prevent the contribution of additional suspendedsolids to receiving streams and by providing habitat for fish and wildlifeadjacent to and in agricultural areas. OSMRE finds Sections 1816.46(b)(7)and 1817.46(b)(8) to be policy statements on retention of sediment pondsas permanent impoundments. As such, they are not inconsistent with theFederal rules. 52. ISP commented that the proposal to add a subsection to Section 1816.43(c)to exempt drainage ditches for pit pumpage, localized precipitation runoff,etc. cannot be adopted. The subsection was deleted and resubmitted Section1816.43(c) contains no such exemption. 53. ISP commented that proposed Section 1816.46(h) has no Federal counterpartand should be deleted. Proposed section 1816.46(h) has been deleted fromresubmitted Section 1816.46. 54. ISP commented that the phrase ``not meeting the size or other qualifyingcriteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a)'' should be deleted from proposed rules 1816.49(b)(9)and (c)(2) and 1817.49(b)(9) and (c)(2)''. Inclusion of this phrase inthe proposed and resubmitted Illinois regulations provides that permanentimpoundments meeting the size criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) must meet spillwaystandards specified in the MSHA regulations. Since the MSHA standards arenot as specific as these required under 30 CFR 816.49, Illinois must revise1816.49 (b)(9) and (c)(2) and 1817.49 (b)(9) (c)(2). See finding 21(cc)above. 55. ISP commented that the phrase ``not meeting the size or other qualifyingcriteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a) ``should be deleted from proposed rules 1816.49(c)(2)and 1817.49(c)(2). Inclusion of this phrase in Sections 1816.49(c) and1817.49(c) of the resubmitted rules directs the applicant's attention tothe possibility that more stringent standards may have to be met than wouldotherwise apply. OSMRE finds inclusion of the subject phrase is not inconsistentwith the Federal rules. 56. ISP stated that the following language should be deleted from proposedsections 1816.62(a) and 1817.62(a) governing pre-blasting surveys. ``Suchnotification shall not be required for any structure where, in accordancewith this section, a survey has been previously requested by the presentor a previous resident or the present or a previous owner and the surveyhas been conducted by the permittee and copies of the survey report havebeen provided to the owner or resident and the Department''. Illinois'resubmitted regulations 1816.62(a) and 1817.62(a) are identical to theFederal counterparts at 816.62(a) and 817.62(a), which do not contain thislanguage. 57. ISP commented that proposed Illinois regulations 1816.62(b) and 1817.62(b)should be changed so that persons desiring pre-blast surveys need notifyeither the regulatory authority or the operator and not both. Resubmittedregulations 1816.62(b) and 1817.63(b) have retained the requirement thatboth the regulatory authority and the operator be notified. This requirementhelps to assure that requested surveys are conducted promptly and it isnot inconsistent with the Federal rules.58. ISP commented that the following language should be incorporated intosection 1816.64(a) concerning blasting schedule limitations. ``The areacovered, timing and sequence of blasting as listed in the schedule, ifsuch limitations are necessary and reasonable in order to protect publichealth and safety and welfare''. This wording has been included in Illinois'resubmitted regulation 1816.64(a). 59. ISP commented that Illinois should incorporate a time requirement formailing the blasting schedule to local governments and public utilitiesin proposed 1816.64(c)(2). The Federal counterpart at 816.64(b)(2) imposesno time requirement on mailing of the blasting schedules to local governmentsand public utilities. 60. ISP commented that the Department should retain the requirement thatthe blasting schedule in proposed 1816.64(c)(2) include information aboutpeople's right to a pre-blasting survey. Illinois resubmitted the ruleconsistent with its Federal counterpart. 61. ISP commented that proposed regulations 1816.67(b)(1) and 1817.67(b)(1)should be changed to require the written waiver to be submitted to theDepartment before blasting. Resubmitted 1816.67(b)(1) and 1817.67(b)(1)have been changed to be consistent with Federal counterparts 30 CFR 816.67(e)(2)and 817.67(e)(2). 62. ISP stated that rules 1816.67(c)(3) and 1817.67(c)(3) governing compliancewith blasting limits should be changed to require that ``the operator shallconduct periodic monitoring to assure compliance with the limits in thisSection''. Resubmitted Illinois rules 1816.67(c)(3) and 1817.67(c)(3) statethat the Department may require an air blast measurement of any and allblasts, and may specify the location of such measurements. OSMRE findsthis requirement allows for proper air blast monitoring if it should becomenecessary. The same flexibility is not necessary with regard to changesin ground vibration monitoring from those specified in the permit application.The rules are consistent with Federal rules. 63. ISP commented that proposed regulations 1816.67(e) and 1817.67(e) shouldbe rewritten to include the requirement that ``Particle velocity shallbe recorded in three mutually perpendicular directions. The maximum allowablepeak particle velocity shall apply to each of the three measurements.''By cross-referencing 1816.67(h) and 1817.67(h), resubmitted Illinois regulations1816.67(e) and 1817.67(e) include this requirement and are consistent withFederal rules. 64. ISP commented that proposed regulations 1816.68(a)(3) and 1817.68(a)(3)should be changed to require the name, signature, and certification numberof the blaster conducting the blast. Resubmitted regulations 1816.68(a)(3)and 1817.68(a)(3) are identical to Federal counterparts 816.68(c) and 817.68(c).65. ISP commented that proposed regulations 1816.68(a) and 1817.68(a) concerningblasting records should include the items found at 30 CFR 816.68(e), weatherconditions, and 816.68(n), mats or other protection used. Resubmitted regulations1816.68(a) and 1817.68(a) require the inclusion of wind velocity and directionin blasting records. OSMRE finds the resubmitted Illinois regulations sufficientto determine compliance with the performance standards which Illinois blastersmust meet. Therefore, the regulations as resubmitted are not inconsistentwith Federal regulations. 66. ISP commented that proposed regulations 1816.133(a) and 1817.133(a)should be changed to read: ``All affected land shall be restored in a timelymanner to a condition * * *.'' Resubmitted regulations 1816.133(a) and1817.133(a) state ``all disturbed areas shall be restored in timely mannerto a condition capable of supporting * * *.'' OSMRE finds the resubmittedrules consistent with the Federal regulations. 67. ISP commented that there is no provision under the Federal Act andrules for approving changes in the pre-mining capability and potentialuses of land, except as higher or better uses under the alternative post-miningland provisions. If the proposed alternative is not a higher or betteruse, it cannot be approved. ISP therefore recommended that the proposedphrase allowing changes in the total acreage from one land use to anotherbe deleted. 30 CFR 816.133(a) clearly allows premining to postmining land use changes,but specifies that premining capability must be restored or made higheror better. Illinois resubmitted 1816.133 which clearly requires all disturbedareas to be restored to a condition capable of supporting the uses whichthey were capable of supporting prior to any mining or higher or betteruses. Thus, resubmitted 1816.133 is consistent with 30 CFR 816.133. 68. ISP commented that proposed regulations 1816.133 and 1817.133, concerningvariances from approximate original contour, should be changed to add thelanguage found at 30 CFR 816.133(d). The Federal requirement at 30 CFR816.133(d) has been remanded in <T3>In Re (II), supra,</T3> and the requested changes are not necessary.69. ISP commented that proposed regulation 1817.22(c)(2), concerning topsoilstorage, should be modified by adding ``and'' at the end of (c)(2)(c).This change was adopted in resubmitted regulation 1817.22(c)(2)(c).  70. ISP commented that proposed regulation 1817.22(e) should be modifiedby adding 1817.117 to the list of revegetation requirements with whichthe covered activity must comply. Omission of Section 1817.117 was a typographicalerror. Illinois resubmitted 1817.22(e) to include 1817.117 in the listof revegetation requirements with which subsoil segregation must comply.71. ISP stated that Illinois must define the term ``underground miningand reclamation activities'' used in establishing the scope of proposedregulation 1817.41(a). ``Underground mining activities'' and ``reclamation''are defined in Section 1701.5 and carry the same meaning when used in 1817.41(a).Definition of these terms in 1817.41(a) would be redundant.72. ISP commented that additional wording concerning groundwater protectionshould be added to proposed regulation 1817.41(b). OSMRE has removed 30CFR 817.41(b)(2); therefore, the requested change in wording is not necessaryfor the Illinois regulation to be no less effective than the Federal counterpart.73. ISP commented that proposed regulation 1817.64 should be changed toread the same as section 1816.64 concerning surface blasting. Illinoisresubmitted regulation 1817.64 to be consistent with the Federal rule.74. ISP commented that proposed regulation 1817.71(j)(1) should have thefollowing wording added: ``the report shall include appearances of instability,structural weakness and other hazardous conditions''. Resubmitted 1817.71(j)(1)includes this language and OSMRE finds the regulation consistent with theFederal rule.75. ISP submitted multiple comments supporting modification to the State'sproposed 1817.122(c) governing the operator's responsibilities for correctionof damages to structures and the land surface by planned subsidence. ISPstrongly recommended that operators be required to submit written agreementswith affected landowners prior to causing subsidence. The Federal regulationsat 30 CFR 817.122 do not require such agreements. OSMRE finds the State'sprovisions at 187.122 for correction of material damage caused by subsidenceto be consistent with the Federal regulations.76. ISP commented that requirements for public notice contained in proposed1817.122 governing subsidence control should be changed to specify moreclearly the exact time that undermining is to occur and to specify thetype of undermining that is planned. Resubmitted 1817.122 has been modifiedto require the notice to specify the type of mining to be employed. Illinoisresubmitted 1817.122 consistent with 30 CFR 817.122 and no further specificityis necessary.77. ISP submitted multiple comments suggesting modifications to changesproposed by Illinois to Part 1823, which established performance standardsfor operations on prime farmland. The regulations resubmitted by Illinoison May 22, 1987, no longer propose any change to Illinois' existing Part1823. Therefore, existing Part 1823 is not subject to this rulemaking.OSMRE did approve certain amendments to Part 1823 on December 10, 1986(51 FR 44454).78. ISP stated that the wording of proposed regulation 1825.14(a) governingsoil replacement on high capability lands should be changed. There is noFederal counterpart of Illinois' Part 1825 covering high capability lands.OSMRE finds the regulation is not inconsistent with the Federal Act orregulations.79. ISP stated that the Department must substitute ``coal processing plants''for ``coal preparation plants'' in Section 1827. Illinois has defined ``coalpreparation plant'' in Section 1701.5; therefore this change is unnecessary.The revised Illinois definition is consistent with the Federal definition.80. ISP stated that proposed Sections 1827.1 and 1827.11 must be rewrittento specify that they apply to all activities included in the definition,regardless of whether all of the activities or facilities included in thedefinition are located or conducted on that site. The Department's regulationsinclude the same jurisdictional reach as their counterpart Federal regulationsand are therefore consistent.81. ISP stated that proposed regulation 1840.11(a) should be amended toinclude language requiring the Department to conduct partial inspectionsof inactive surface coal mining and reclamation operations. The Departmentchanged section 1840.11(a) by adding the following language to the endof the first sentence: ``and shall conduct partial inspections of eachinactive surface coal mining and reclamation operation under its jurisdictionto ensure enforcement of the approved State program''. The regulations,as amended, make the Department's provisions consistent with 30 CFR 843.11(a).82. ISP stated that Illinois does not define ``inactive surface coal miningand reclamation operations'' and should adopt a counterpart to 30 CFR 840.11(f).The Department has adopted a subsection (f) to mirror the Federal counterpartat 30 CFR 840.11(f). Section 1840.11, as amended, is consistent with 30CFR 840.11(f).83. ISP stated that phrase ``carried out during the enforcement of a Stateprogram'' should be deleted from proposed rule 1843.12(a)(1). The resubmittedIllinois rule has deleted the particulars pertaining to the Federal rolesince the State lacks jurisdiction over Federal oversight enforcement activities.84. ISP stated that the regulation 1843.13(a)(4)(A)(i) should be amendedby replacing ``enforcement of a State'' with the phrase ``the permanentregulatory'' in order to enhance clarity. The State adopted this recommendationand section 1843.13(a)(4)(A)(i) was amended by replacing the words ``enforcementof a State'' with ``the permanent regulatory''. This is consistent withthe Federal regulations.85. ISP proposed that the following should be added to 1843.13(f): ``(6)any party which intervenes in the proceeding must be informed of the date,time and place of the pre-hearing conference. Any party which intervenesmust agree to any settlement in order for such a settlement to revoke aShow Cause Order.''ISP stated it is concerned that a settlement of a Show Cause Order maybe reached without the participation and agreement of any intervenors.As set forth in the administrative record, ``an entity allowed to intervenewould receive notice of the pre-hearing conference. If the intervenor desiredto participate in the proceeding as a full party, assuming interventionwas granted, its participation in the settlement process would occur asa matter of course.'' OSMRE finds this response to be appropriate and theIllinois rules no less effective than the federal rules.86. ISP stated that proposed 1843.17 should be retained since its repealwould eliminate any requirement in the State program for operators to exhaustadministrative remedies prior to seeking relief in State court.Resubmitted section 1843.17 retains this requirement, which insures thatthe Illinois rule remains consistent with the Federal regulations.87. ISP proposed that section 1845.13(b)(4)(B) be changed and that thelanguage in brackets be deleted and replaced by the language in parenthesesas follows: If the person to whom the notice or order [abates] (was issuedtakes extraordinary measures to abate) the violation in the shortest possibletime and that abatement was achieved before the time set for abatement,up to [five hundred dollars ($500)] (two hundred dollars ($200)) shallbe subtracted from the proposed penalty amount.The Department is not required to model its ``good faith'' regulationsafter the Federal counterpart. The Department is, however, required toinsure that an operator's good faith is determined pursuant to Section518(a) of SMCRA. OSMRE finds that an operator's good faith under the Illinoisregulation will be determined in accordance with Section 518(a) of SMCRA.No changes have been made.88. ISP commented that the initially proposed 1700.15 appeared to be deletedfrom the resubmitted Illinois regulations and requested that it be reinstated.The lack of 1700.15 in the Illinois resubmittal means existing 1700.15remains unamended and in effect.89. ISP commented that the Illinois definition of ``affected area'' failsto make clear that the area above underground workings is included in thisdefinition. The Illinois definition of affected area need not referencethe area over the underground workings because of the shadow area concept.The performance standards at 1817.121 establish standards governing therepair and correction of damage to land and structures in the shadow areacaused by subsidence which is consistent with the federal counterparts.90. ISP requested that the shadow area or area over underground workingsbe included in the permit area. OSMRE has previously determined that thedefinition of permit area does not include surface areas above undergroundworkings, which in Illinois is defined as the shadow area. The Illinoisdefinition of permit area is therefore consistent with the Federal rules.91. ISP commented that the Illinois definition of reclamation should notexclude subsidence control measures conducted in the shadow area to restoredamaged land to pre-mining capability. Although there is a potential forsubsidence-related damage in areas overlying the underground workings,there is no reclamation work required pursuant to 1816.22 and 1816.100through 1816.116 (topsoiling, backfilling and grading and revegetation).Instead, consistent with the Federal regulations, 1817.121 requires repairand or correction of subsidence-related damages occurring in the shadowarea.92. ISP recommended that the current Illinois regulation 1762.12, additionalcriteria for lands unsuitable, be reinstated. The Federal counterpart 30CFR 762.12 is a permissive regulation which provides that States may adoptadditional criteria. Based upon the Federal rule, there is no need forIllinois to include this regulation in its program.93. ISP commented that the proposed and resubmitted Illinois regulation1764.15 fails to include the opportunity for public comment or a publichearing on the completeness of a lands unsuitable petition. The Federalrule at 30 CFR 764.15(b)(2) specifying that a regulatory authority mayprovide for such public participation in the completeness of a petitionhas been removed (52 FR 49322, December 30, 1987). Therefore, the commentis moot.94. ISP commented that the requirement in resubmitted 1773.13(b)(1) thatany person claiming to have an interest which is or may be adversely affectedby a permit decision must identify the interest and how the decision willaffect the interest should be deleted. OSMRE finds that this requirementis a reasonable addition to expedite the processing of comments and/orobjections to permit applications. ISP further requested that, if OSMREapproved the rule as resubmitted, the Office answer several questions concerninghow Illinois would respond to several different types of information submittedunder this rule. OSMRE cannot predict what action Illinois might take oninformation submitted and therefore cannot respond to this request. Theresubmitted Illinois regulation 1773.13(b)(1) is consistent with 30 CFR773.13(b)(2), which explicitly establishes the ``adversely affected interest''requirement for objections.95. ISP also stated its concern about resubmitted Illinois regulation 1773.13(c),which requires a person requesting an informal conference to identify hisinterest and how the interest would be impacted by a permit decision. Thisregulation is not inconsistent with the Federal counterpart which establishesthe ``adversely affected interest'' requirement.96. ISP commented the resubmitted Illinois regulation 1773.14(a), whichrequires that persons requesting public hearings identify their interestand how this interest would be impacted by a permit decision should bedeleted. As with resubmitted Illinois regulations 1773.13(b)(1) and 1773.13(c),OSMRE believes the requirement is a reasonable addition which will expeditethe processing of hearing requests and is consistent with the Federal regulations.97. ISP requested that any change in direction or location of undergroundmining in an already approved shadow area not be considered an insignificantrevision as proposed in resubmitted Illinois rule 1774.13(b)(2)(C). Federalregulations provide that the regulatory authority shall establish guidelineswhich define the scale or extent or revisions which shall be consideredsignificant revisions. The resubmitted Illinois regulation which addressesunderground mining direction and location was approved by OSMRE in theoriginal approval of the State program and remains consistent with currentFederal regulations.98. ISP commented that extensions to shadow areas should not be consideredinsignificant permit revisions as proposed under Illinois resubmitted rule1774.13(d). The Illinois regulation provides that only extensions to theshadow area which meet the requirements of an incidental boundary revisionwill be considered as insignificant. OSMRE finds the rule consistent withthe Federal regulation.99. ISP suggested that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1775.11(e)(4), whichprovides that an operator shall be allowed to continue operation underan existing permit while a permit decision appeal is pending, be changedto ``may be allowed'' as provided in the Federal regulation. The permissivelanguage of the Federal rule allows Illinois to exercise this option, providedthe operator has a valid permit. This is consistent with 30 CFR 775.11(b)(2)(iv).100. ISP requested that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1778.15(a) be revisedto require a notarized copy of the right-of-entry document rather thana description of the document as required by 30 CFR 778.15(a). The Illinoisrule as proposed requires the same information as the Federal rule andtherefore is consistent.In addition, ISP suggested that the language in this rule be amended torequire right-of-entry information for surface areas over underground mineworkings when planned subsidence techniques are to be used. The Federalcounterpart, 30 CFR 778.15(a), does not require right-of-entry informationfor areas above underground mining areas. Therefore, the Illinois regulationis consistent with the Federal rule.101. ISP commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1779.20(c) failsto include Federal fish and wildlife management, conservation or land managementagencies as agencies which will be consulted on fish and wildlife resourceinformation. The approved Illinois program assigns this consultation responsibilityto the Illinois Department of Conservation through an approved interagencyagreement.102. ISP requested that Indian burial grounds and other lands where bodiesare interred be added to resubmitted Illinois regulations 1779.24(j). TheIllinois rule requires that each public or private cemetery be shown onmaps submitted with an application. The Illinois definition of cemeteryincludes any area where human bodies are interred. This would include Indianburial grounds or other areas where human bodies are interred. OSMRE findsthe Illinois rule consistent with the Federal regulation.103. ISP commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1780.23(a)(3) failsto include the Federal language requiring submission of all materials neededfor approval of the alternative land use. Resubmitted Illinois regulation1780.23(a)(3) states that, where a land use different from the preminingland use is proposed, alternative post-mining land uses may be approvedby the Department after consideration of the relationship of the intendeduses to existing land use policies and plans and the comments of any ownerof the surface and the land management agency having jurisdiction overthe land. This requirement coupled with requirements in Illinois 1816.133that also govern postmining land use are consistent with the Federal regulationsgoverning postmining land use determinations.104. ISP commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1784.13(b)(4) failsto include the provision in 30 CFR 784.13(b)(4) that allows the regulatoryauthority to require additional information relating to a request for atopsoil substitute material. Since the Federal provision is discretionary,Illinois is not required to incorporate it in its regulations; however,OSMRE interprets this omission as meaning that Illinois has general authorityto request additional information where needed.105. ISP recommended that the current Illinois regulation 1784.14(a) bereinstated. The resubmitted 1784.14 requires all information necessaryto insure the protection of groundwater as required by the Federal regulations.106. ISP recommended that proposed rules 1800.13(b) (3) and (4) be deleted.These rules were not included in the resubmitted Illinois regulations.107. ISP expanded its comments on the proposed Illinois regulation 1800.15when commenting on the resubmitted 1800.15. The original comments and theexpansion of these comments addressed ISP's belief that bonds should beadjusted to reflect possible subsidence damage. Areas subject to subsidence,unless they are within a permit area, are not required to be bonded. Therefore,a bond adjustment requirement is not necessary to be consistent with theFederal regulations.108. ISP commented that resubmitted 1815.15(d) should be revised to requiretopsoil to be removed, stored and redistributed on areas disturbed by coalexploration activities as necessary to assure successful revegetation.30 CFR 815.15(d) requires topsoil to be removed, stored and redistributedas necessary to assure successful revegetation or as required by the regulatoryauthority. Illinois rule 1815.15(d) specifies removal unless the operatorcan demonstrate that topsoil will not be affected by excessive erosion,compaction and contamination. It also lists what must be shown as requiredin 30 CFR 815.15(d) and is therefore consistent with the Federal rule.109. ISP supported resubmitted Illinois regulations 1816.22(b)(2) and 1817.22(b)(2),which provide guidance on how decisions will be made as to whether a requestfor a topsoil substitution is an insignificant or significant revision.ISP did object to the portion of the rule which automatically exemptednon-prime farmland soils. As provided in 30 CFR 774.13(b)(2), the regulatoryauthority shall establish guidelines defining significant and insignificantrevisions. The resubmitted Illinois regulations at 1816.22(b)(2) and 1817.22(b)(2)have established those guidelines in conformance with the Federal rules.110. ISP commented that proposed Illinois regulation 1816.46(g) shouldbe included in the resubmitted regulations. OMSRE notes that the inspectionrequirements contained in proposed 1816.46(g) appear in resubmitted Illinoisregulation 1816.49(a)(10). Therefore, Illinois regulations 1816.46 and1816.49(a) are consistent with the Federal regulations.111. ISP recommended that proposed Illinois regulation 1816.49(a)(9), whichaddressed highwalls below water lines in impoundments, be included onlyfor the limited purposes of impoundments on previously mined areas. Theresubmitted regulations no longer contain the provision.112. ISP requested that proposed Illinois regulation 1816.49(b)(7)(c) bereinstated. Resubmitted 1816.49(a)(7) requires that perimeter slopes berevegetated and current regulation 1816.116 requires successful revegetationprior to bond release. These regulations will insure that perimeter slopeswill be properly vegetated and are thus no less effective than the Federalcounterpart.113. ISP commented that, because resubmitted Illinois regulations 1816.49(b)(9)and 1817.49(b)(9) contain the qualifying phrase ``not meeting the sizeor other criteria of 30 CFR 77.216(a),'' that certain impoundments willnot meet required standards. Resubmitted Illinois regulations 1816.49(a)(1)and 1817.49(a)(1) require that those impoundments which do meet the sizerequirements of 30 CFR 77.216(a) utilize the standards in 30 CFR 77.216which imposes a more general spillway design requirement than does 30 CFR816.49(b)(7). Therefore, Illinois must revise 1816.49(b)(9) and (c)(2)and 1817.49(b)(9) and (c)(2) to cover all impoundments consistent with30 CFR 816.49 and 817.49. See finding 22(cc).114. ISP identified a typographical error in resubmitted 1816.67(e) and1817.67(e) in which a qualifying ``or'' was omitted. Illinois has beennotified of this omission and will correct the error. OSMRE is interpretingthese rules to include the omitted language and thus finds the Illinoisrule, as interpreted in this approval, no less effective than the Federalcounterpart.115. ISP identified an error in resubmitted Illinois regulations 1816.83(a)(3)and 1817.83(a)(3) which incorrectly referenced 1816.73(1)(2). The correctreferences are 1816.71(k)(1)(2) and 1817.71(k)(1)(2). The State has beennotified of this error and will correct the references.116. ISP commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1816.106(a)(1)would require permitting of reasonably available spoil from the previousmining operations only in the context of 30 CFR 816.106(a)(1), which makesit clear that all reasonably available spoil in the immediate vicinityshould be included in the permit area. Resubmitted Illinois regulationsrequire that all affected areas be permitted. Any spoil area to be utilizedfalls under the definition of affected area and would therefore be permittedunder Illinois regulations.117. ISP recommended that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1817.71(k) berevised to include language which makes it clear that coal processing wastecannot be disposed of in head of hollow or valley fills. The Illinois regulationis the same as 30 CFR 817.71(i), both of which allow disposal of coal minewaste in excess spoil fills under certain specified conditions.118. ISP commented that the shadow area should be added to 1817.97(b) asan area from which an operator would be required to report any threatenedor endangered species. The Federal regulations do not require such notificationbeyond the permit area. Therefore, the Illinois regulation is consistentwith the Federal rules.119. ISP objected to the inclusion of Soil Conservation Service soil compactionstandards, which are only in the proposed stage of rulemaking, in resubmittedregulation 1825.14(e), which addresses high capability lands. Section 1825is an Illinois regulation with no Federal counterpart. Therefore, Illinoismay adopt any standard which does not conflict with a Federal regulation.120. ISP commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1840.14(c)(2) restrictsthe mailing of records free of charge to a requester to documents ten pagesor less in length.The Federal rule at 30 CFR 840.14(c) specifies that the regulatory authoritymay comply with the availability of records requirement by either makingsuch records available for inspection at a Federal, State or local governmentoffice in the county in which the mine is located or by supplying themto the requester by mail. Illinois complies with the first option by filingcopies of records in the county courthouse. Therefore, if Illinois alsowishes to supply copies by mail, it may do so under whatever conditionsit wishes to establish.121. ISP commented that resubmitted regulation 1843.12(a) would allow Stateinspectors to visit mine sites and not issue a violation on the groundsthat the inspection was being conducted for purposes other than enforcementof the State program. As proposed and resubmitted, this rule has been revisedto delete language in the existing program pertaining only to Federal oversightinspections; therefore, the Director finds ISP's allegation to be unfounded.The amended rule contains enforcement provisions consistent with thoseof 30 CFR 843.12.122. Old Ben Coal Company (``Old Ben'') provided extensive legal argumentsobjecting to resubmitted Illinois regulation 1817.121(c)(2), which providesfor the repair of and/or compensation for subsidence damage to structures.In response, the Director notes that 30 CFR 817.121(c) requires that subsidencedamage to structures be covered to the extent required under State law.Illinois has determined that structures are protected in Illinois and resubmittedIllinois regulation 1817.121(c)(2) reflects this determination. This requirementis consistent with the Federal regulations. 123. Old Ben commented that resubmitted regulation 1817.122, providingfor a six-month subsidence notice would require information not requiredby Federal law or regulation. The Illinois regulation includes all of theinformation required by Federal regulations and is therefore consistentwith these regulations.124. Old Ben objected to the inclusion of ``surface and underground agriculturaldrainage systems'' to the introductory paragraph of resubmitted Illinoisregulation 1784.20. The introductory paragraph of 1784.20 contains allof the information required by the Federal regulations and is thereforeconsistent with the Federal rules.125. Old Ben recommended that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1784.20(f)be revised to include the phrase ``to the extent required under State law''.Because Illinois law provides for the protection of structures, this phrase,which is included in the Federal rule, is not needed. 126. Old Ben requested that the second sentence in resubmitted Illinoisregulation 1817.22(a)(1) be deleted. It was Old Ben's opinion that thisprovision would require an operator to upgrade topsoil quality. The Illinoisregulation is the same as 30 CFR 817.22(a)(ii) and is consistent with theFederal rule.127. Old Ben commented that the language ``* * * and the resulting soilmedium is the best available in the area to support vegetation'' containedin resubmitted Illinois regulation 1817.22(b)(1) is superfluous. This languageis the same as the Federal regulation at 30 CFR 817.22(b).128. Old Ben recommended that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1817.41(e)(2)requiring that surface water monitoring data be submitted to the regulatoryauthority be deleted in deference to the requirement to send the same datato the State Environmental Protection Agency. This Illinois requirementallows mine operators to fulfill the surface monitoring requirements ofSMCRA with the submission of NPDES reports already required by other lawsand therefore reduces duplication. The Illinois regulation is consistentwith the Federal regulations.129. Old Ben commented that the Illinois definition of siltation structurewithin resubmitted regulation 1817.46(a)(1) should be expanded to includethe additional structures contained in the 1701.5 definition of siltationstructures. Rule 1817.46(a)(1) covers other treatment facilities, whichwould include those additional structures recommended by Old Ben. The Illinoisregulation is consistent with Federal rules without the suggested additionallanguage.130. Old Ben requested that resubmitted 1817.46(c)(2)(B) be revised toallow grass or earth lined single spillways if it can be shown that thespillway velocity will not contribute to erosion of the spillway. The Illinoisregulation is the same as the Federal counterpart and is therefore acceptableas resubmitted.131. Old Ben commented that resubmitted Illinois regulations 1817.49 (b)(7)and (b)(8) are not required by Federal regulations and should be deleted.This paragraph, which provides additional guidance on the design of impoundments,is not inconsistent with the Federal regulations and therefore is acceptableas resubmitted. 132. Old Ben objected to the inclusion in resubmitted Illinois regulation1817.71(h) of language making terracing mandatory once a fill height exceeds40 feet. 30 CFR 817.71(e)(3) provides that terraces may be constructedif required. Illinois has determined that terraces are required once thefill height reaches 40 feet. This requirement is not inconsistent withthe Federal regulations.133. Old Ben commented that resubmitted regulation 1817.100 contains thephrases ``subsidence control'' and ``subsidence control efforts'' whichare not included in the comparable Federal rule. The Federal rule at 30CFR 1817.100 references areas affected by surface impacts incident to anunderground coal mine and requires the surface impacts of underground minesto be addressed as contemporaneously as other surface impacts. Therefore,the Illinois regulation is consistent with the Federal regulation.134. Old Ben requested that ``* * * except as specified in section 1773.11(b)(1)(C)* * *'' be added to resubmitted 1700.11(c), which addresses applicabilityof the Illinois regulations. The Director finds that there is no conflictor inconsistency between the dates contained in the two cited State rules,and that there is no need or reason to adopt the suggested change.135. Old Ben commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1761.11(e)goes beyond the Federal rule by prohibiting mining within 300 feet of dwellingsunder construction or contract at the time of public notice. The Directorfinds that the Illinois regulation is not inconsistent with the Federalrule by protecting additional present or planned structures.136. Old Ben commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1764.15 failsto include language similar to that of 30 CFR 764.15 allowing the suspensionof petitions to designate lands unsuitable if there is no real or foreseeablepotential for surface coal mining operations in the area. These Federalprovisions were suspended by the U.S. District Court in <T3>In re: Permanent II, supra </T3>and removed on December 30, 1987. Therefore,there is no basis for inclusion of similar language in the Illinois regulation.137. Old Ben requested several changes in resubmitted Illinois regulation1764.19 to remove the State's basis for conditioning future mining operationsin all or part of an area subject to a lands unsuitable petition. The currentIllinois regulation [1764.19(b)] also contains this conditioning clause,which was determined to be consistent with the same Federal regulationsat the time of program approval. Therefore, the State regulation need notbe changed.138. Old Ben suggested that the Illinois definition of ``valid existingrights'' contained within resubmitted regulation 1701.5 be suspended untilsuch time as OSMRE responds to the U.S. District Court's remand of thecomparable Federal definition. As discussed in Finding 2(b), the Directoris deferring a decision on the State definition.139. Old Ben objected to resubmitted Illinois regulation 1773.11(b)(1)(C),which requires that mining operations under an initial program permit complywith 62 IAC Parts 1800 through 1850, the permanent program bonding andperformance standards, on or after February 1, 1983. In response, the Directornotes that Section 505(b) of SMCRA specifies that any State law or regulationwhich provides more stringent environmental controls and regulations thanthe Federal requirements shall not be construed as being inconsistent withthose requirements.140. Old Ben objected to resubmitted Illinois regulation 1774.15, whichestablishes a minimum of 180 days before expiration of a permit as thedeadline for filing for renewal. The Federal rule at 30 CFR 774.15 providesthat the application for renewal must be submitted at least 120 days priorto expiration. States are free to choose any length of time equal to orin excess of 120 days.141. Old Ben requested deletion of the ``shadow area'' from resubmittedIllinois regulation 1778.15, which defines the area for which right-of-entryinformation is required. The resubmitted rule states that this informationis not required for the shadow area if the surface estate will not be disturbedby surface facilities and related surface activities. The correspondingFederal rule at 30 CFR 778.15 requires right-of-entry information for thesame areas as the Illinois rule. Therefore the resubmitted regulation isconsistent with the Federal rule.142. Old Ben objected to the inclusion of the shadow area in resubmittedIllinois regulation 1783.11. The Federal counterpart at 30 CFR 783.11 referenceadjacent areas which may be affected or impacted by the proposed undergroundmining activities. The shadow area concept utilized by Illinois describesthe surface area over underground mining operations and is consistent withthe Federal regulation.143. Old Ben commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1783.12 alsoincluded the shadow area as an area for which general environmental resourcesinformation must be provided. As stated in the previous response, the useby Illinois of the shadow area to describe the area above underground miningoperations is an acceptable procedure and its use in the various informationalrequirements of the program is consistent with the Federal regulations.144. Old Ben further objected to inclusion of the shadow area in resubmittedIllinois regulations 1783.22_Land Use Information and 1783.23_Maps: GeneralRequirements. As stated in responses to prior Old Ben comments, use ofthe shadow area for the purpose of further defining the area for whichinformation must be gathered for a surface coal mining and reclamationpermit is consistent with the Federal regulations.145. Old Ben pointed out that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1784.14(i)(3)requires submission to the regulatory authority of surface water monitoringreports required by the Illinois Environmental Protection Agency (IEPA),but that such reports are not required by the Federal analog. The Illinoisregulation makes it clear that NPDES and other monitoring reports requiredby IEPA are considered a part of the monitoring system required pursuantto the surface mining permit. This procedure is consistent with the Federalrequirement.146. Old Ben commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1843.11 containsadditional language not specifically included in the Federal counterpart.The additional Illinois language is permitted under the Federal languagein 30 CFR 843.11(a)(3), which allows the regulatory authority to imposeaffirmative obligations. As resubmitted, the Illinois regulation is consistentwith the Federal counterpart.147. The Association of Illinois Soil and Water Conservation Districts(AISWCD) submitted a large number of comments on the proposed Illinoisregulations. With the following exceptions, the comments are similar tocomments submitted by the Illinois South Project (ISP) and are addressedwith those comments.148. AISWCD commented that proposed Illinois regulation 1784.20 shouldinclude the phrase ``including surface and underground agricultural drainagesystems''. The resubmitted Illinois regulations include this phrase.149. The Illinois Historic Preservation Agency (IHPA) submitted numerouscomments concerning Illinois regulations which address archeological andhistoric resources. On June 9, 1987, OSMRE notified the State of the changesrequired as a result of recently approved Federal regulations concerninghistoric resources. On September 18, 1987, Illinois submitted proposedregulations to OSMRE to address the required changes. IHPA, other agenciesand the public have been provided opportunity to comment on these proposals.OSMRE will shortly announce its decision concerning these amendments.150. IHPA commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1700.18(a), whichdescribes the Surface Mining Advisory Council, fails to include a representativeof the historic/cultural resources community. There is no Federal counterpartfor this advisory council; therefore, there are no Federal requirementsgoverning the makeup of this State Council.151. IHPA requested clarification of the term ``historic designation''as it is used in the resubmitted Illinois regulation 1701.5 definitionof ``historic lands''. This definition is the same as the definition containedin Federal rule at 30 CFR 762.5. The Illinois rule as resubmitted is consistentwith the Federal rule.152. IHPA requested that the resubmitted Illinois definition of ``person''contained in 1701.5 include the term ``historic'' as one of the values.The Illinois definition is the same as the Federal definition and thereforeis consistent with 30 CFR 701.5.153. IHPA commented that resubmitted Illinois regulation 1764.23(a) shouldexempt all archeological sites from public disclosure. The Illinois rulesare identical to the Federal counterpart, 30 CFR 764.23(a), and thereforeare consistent with the Federal regulations.154. IHPA requested that the word ``known'' be dropped from resubmittedIllinois regulation 1772.12(b). The Illinois regulation is identical tothe Federal rule and the request is therefore rejected. The remainder ofIHPA comments on this section recommended the addition of the phrase ``pursuantto the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966''. OSMRE believes thisto be redundant.155. IHPA suggested adding ``sites eligible for listing'' to resubmittedIllinois regulation 1772.12(d)(2)(C). The regulation is identical to theFederal rule and therefore consistent.156. IHPA commented on Illinois resubmitted regulation 1773.15(c), whichconcerns the written findings required for historic properties. The Directorhas notified the State that an additional revision is necessary. By letterdated September 16, 1987, IDMM submitted additional proposed regulationsamending 1773.15(c) to require a written finding for historic properties.157. IHPA requested that the word ``known'' be deleted from resubmittedIllinois regulation 1783.24(i). The use of the term ``known'' is consistentin each case with the Federal counterpart and is therefore approved.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Director's Decision</ITAG>Based on the above findings, the Director is approving the amendments to62 IAC Parts 1700 to 1845, as submitted by Illinois on May 22, 1987, exceptfor those provisions discussed in Findings 2(b), 2(c), and 4(b) concerningvalid existing rights, previously mined areas and protection of privatelyowned sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places. As providedby 30 CFR 732.17(a) and (g), any provisions that are not approved by theDirector may not be implemented as part of the Illinois program.In addition, the Director is requiring that Illinois further amend itsprogram as discussed below:1. As discussed in Finding 14(f), Illinois must revise 62 IAC 1780.21(f)and 1784.14(e) or otherwise amend its program to require that the determinationof probable hydrologic consequences include findings consistent with 30CFR 780.21(f)(3) and 784.14(e)(3), that it be based on baseline data collectedfor the permit application, and that each application for a permit revisionbe reviewed by the regulatory authority to determine whether a new or updateddetermination is necessary.2. As discussed in Finding 21(hh), Illinois must revise 62 IAC 1816.49(b)(9)and (c) and 1817.49(b)(9) and (c) or otherwise amend its program to includespillway size requirements for all impoundments consistent with 30 CFR816.49(b)(7) and (c)(2) and 817.49(b)(7) and (c)(2).3. As discussed in Finding 4(a), Illinois must further revise 62 IAC 1761.11(a)to include provisions concerning the protection of wild and scenic studyriver corridors that are no less effective than the Federal rule at 30CFR 761.11(a).The Federal rules at 30 CFR Part 913 are being amended to implement thisdecision. Since, as explained Findings 2(h), 17(h), 21(jj), 21(kk) and21(ll), this amendment satisfies the requirements of 30 CFR 913.16(a) and(c) through (f), the Director is removing these provisions. However, nothingin this decision negates the need for Illinois to further revise its programin accordance with earlier notifications provided under 30 CFR 732.17(d).This final rule is being made effective immediately to expedite the Stateprogram amendment process and to encourage States to conform their programsto Federal standards without undue delay.In accordance with 30 CFR 732.17(h)(11)(ii), the Director has, by letterdated July 16, 1987, obtained the concurrence of the U.S. EPA in the approvalof the portions of these amendments pertaining to air and water qualitystandards promulgated under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.)and the Clean Water Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.).<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Additional Determinations</ITAG>Compliance With the National Environmental Policy ActThe Secretary has determined that, pursuant to section 702(d) of SMCRA,30 U.S.C. 1292(d), no environmental impact statement need be prepared onthis rulemaking.Executive Order No. 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActOn July 12, 1984, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) granted OSMREan exemption from sections 3, 4, 7 and 8 of Executive Order 12291 for actionsdirectly related to approval or conditional approval of State regulatoryprograms. Therefore, this action is exempt from preparation of a regulatoryimpact analysis and regulatory review by OMB.The Department of the Interior has determined that, for purposes of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.), this rule will not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entities.This rule will not impose any new requirements; rather, it will ensurethat existing requirements established by SMCRA and the Federal rules willbe met by the State.Paperwork Reduction ActThis rule does not contain information collection requirements which requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3507.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 30 CFR Part 913</ITAG>Coal mining, Intergovernmental relations, Surface mining, Underground mining.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: October 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
