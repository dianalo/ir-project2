The three-judge tribunal ruled against former Gen. AlfonsoArmada Comin, saying the heart ailment that has hospitalized the68-year-old prisoner does not warrant a transfer to house arrest onhumanitarian grounds.   Armada is serving a sentence of more than 26 years forengineering a 1981 attack on Parliament intended to trigger amilitary revolt against the government of then-Prime MinisterLeopoldo Calvo Sotelo.   The attempt took place six years after the 1975 death of Gen.Francisco Franco ended 36 years of authoritarian rule, and threeyears after King Juan Carlos approved a constitution setting upSpain's democracy.   A pistol-waving officer stormed parliament with 200 fellowparamilitary civil guards, while a second plotter ordered tanksonto the streets of Valencia for an advance on Madrid that nevermaterialized. The revolt was foiled early the next morning whenJuan Carlos said on national television the coup would succeed``only over my dead body.''</TEXT></DOC>
