At this past week's meetings, OPEC settled on raising itsproduction cap from the current 18.5 million barrels a day to 19.5million barrels to support a benchmark price of $18 a 42-gallonbarrel.   It divided the 1 million-barrel increase in productionproportionately, raising each member's supply quota a certain amount.   But still at issue despite the new pact are continued demands byKuwait, the United Arab Emirates and several others in the 13-memberOrganization of Petroleum Countries for a larger share of thecartel's daily output.   Kuwait pressed the issue so strongly at the organization'sjust-ended meeting that the talks nearly collapsed.   ``A lot of problems were swept under the carpet,'' said FergusMacLeod, analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in London.   OPEC ministers plan to meet again in September and take a hardlook at some persistent woes. Indonesia's oil minister, GinandjarKartasasmita, predicted the meeting would be ``crucial for thehistory of OPEC.''   Kuwait's Ali Khalifa al-Sabah endorsed only parts of theagreement reached late Wednesday after six days of bargaining butsaid the nation refused to meet its alloted limit.   Sabah said Kuwait immediately would slash production to 1.35million barrels a day. That would be well above Kuwait'sJuly-December quota of 1.09 million barrels a day but sharply underits estimated current output of nearly 2 million barrels.   Analysts estimate OPEC already is producing about 21 millionbarrels a day, so the cartel would have to rein in output to meetthe new target.   The oil markets initially reacted skeptically to the pact, withU.S. crude futures tumbling before stabilizing at lower levels.   Michael Rothman, senior energy analyst at Merrill Lynch CapitalMarkets in New York, said the agreement injects ``a dose ofpessimism because it signals OPEC is unable to deal with the quotaissue.''   ``It does not bode well for prices (in the short term),'' he said.   He said prices for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S.crude, could slip into the range of $15 to $17 a barrel in theJuly-September quarter.   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate fell 12 cents to$19.88 on Friday, up from the lows of less than $13 a barrel reachedlate last year.   But MacLeod said prices would hold fairly steady if Kuwait andothers did not cheat too much on their quotas. Although Sabah saidKuwait would not obey its quota, MacLeod said, ``He is suggesting hewill show more restraint than expected.''   Paul Mlotok, head of energy research at the investment firmMorgan Stanley andamp; Co. in New York, estimated actual cartel productionwould be just under 21 million barrels a day.   ``That level of production could lead to some erosion fromtoday's price level but nothing too serious,'' he said.   As a result, there should not be much impact on gasoline pricesat the pump, Mlotok said.   In addition to Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates _ a persistentcheater _ was expected to continue producing more than its share.Its new quota is about a million barrels a day but it has beenproducing an estimated 1.6 million barrels.   Gabon and Ecuador also tend to exceed their quotas.   To control the leakage, the producers would have to do somethingabout the sensitive quota issue. But to give more oil to one countrymeans the cartel would have to make the unpopular move of takingaway some from another.   ``Every member probably considers itself to be a special case(for a higher quota),'' said Ian Graham, analyst at the London-basedCounty NatWest.</TEXT></DOC>
