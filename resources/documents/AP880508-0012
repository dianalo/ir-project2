Madeleine Bassil made a televised statement Saturday to Reagan,saying, ``Mr. President, you probably have never heard of me butyou certainly know that Terry Anderson, hostage in Lebanon for overthree years, has a family.''   Ms. Bassil, who is Lebanese, said their 2-year-old daughterSulome ``cannot accept my excuses any longer of why her daddy isonly a picture.''   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the AssociatedPress, was kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985. He has never seenhis daughter.   Ms. Bassil's plea to Reagan comes four days after three Frenchhostages were released in Beirut by the Islamic Jihad, the samepro-Iranian group that claims to hold Anderson.   ``Compromising now is the only solution,'' she told Reagan.``Are we to wait (for) an election before we see our loved one? Wecan't wait any longer, Mr. President. You must do something nowbefore things get out of hand.''   Another American hostage, Thomas Sutherland, dean of agricultureat the American University of Beirut, is also believed held byIslamic Jihad. He was kidnapped in June 1985.   Anderson and Sutherland are among 18 foreign hostages, includingnine Americans, being held hostage.</TEXT></DOC>
