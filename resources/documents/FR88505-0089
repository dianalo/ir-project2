The Boardis responsible for protecting the public interest in a civil service administeredin accord with these merit principles and free from the prohibited personnelpractices. The Board does this by adjudicating employee appeals, actingon actions brought by the Special Counsel, conducting special studies ofthe civil service and other merit systems, and reviewing the regulationsand signficant actions of OPM. The Office of Policy and Evaluation hasprincipal responsibility within the Board for merit systems studies andOPM oversight, including the annual report on OPM's significant actions.<ITAG tagnum="84">(b) What Is a Significant Actions Report?</ITAG>The law (5 U.S.C. 1209(b)) allows the Board substantial discretion to determinewhich actions of OPM are significant to the merit system in any given year.In exercising its discretion as to which actions of OPM it will study,the Board considers several criteria, as follows: (1) Any OPM policy or program which might conflict with the statutory meritprinciples or contribute to the commission of a prohibited personnel practice;(2) The extent to which other major decisions made or actions taken byOPM are in accord with and promote the merit principles; and(3) OPM's impact, overall, on personnel management within the merit systemsof the Federal civil service.The Board's review of OPM's significant actions in 1986 considered fivemajor subject areas: pay for performance (the Performance Management andRecognition System); expanded authority for temporary appointments; reductionin force; hiring of entry-level Federal employees; and performance management.<ITAG tagnum="84">(c) Public Comment on significant Actions</ITAG>The Board invites any interested person or organization to comment on:which actions of OPM during calendar year 1987 were ``significant'' forthe merit system; whether those actions were consistent with the meritsystems principles and free from prohibited personnel practices; what typesof data would be most pertinent in evaluating the significant action(s)being suggested; and from what sources could these data be most appropriatelyobtained.Although comments are invited on any action taken by OPM during 1987, commentsshould be germane to the Board's criteria as described above. Considerationmay also be given to the fact that a lack of action on an issue by OPMcan constitute a significant action for purposes of this review.In addition, the Board invites comments on the following topics which arealready under consideration:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Development and implementation of new or revised classification andqualification standards;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Quality of worklife activities, as reflected in such Government policiesand programs as the drug-free workplace program, and the problems of individualssuffering from Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), as well as theconcerns of their co-workers;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Executive development, including the status of the Federal ExecutiveInstitute; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_College recruitment, concentrating on OPM's progams to assist theGovernment in attracting the best college graduates from all segments ofsociety.</ITAG>Finally, the Board also invites comments on the relative priority thatshould be assigned to each of the significant actions being suggested,including those topics listed above.<ITAG tagnum="84">(d) Format for Comments</ITAG>For each topic being suggested, please provide a short statement of theissue being raised, along with a brief explanation as to why it shouldbe reviewed, and the impact_positive or negative_that OPM's related actionhas had on the Federal service.Suggestions on what data (nature and sources) would be most useful in evaluatingthe issue and OPM's action(s), as well as comments on the relative priorityof all potential study topics, should be shown in a separate paragraph.<ITAG tagnum="84">(e) Confidentiality</ITAG>The Board will protect the identify of persons submitting comments andthe confidentiality of such comments to the extent permitted by law.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: May 2, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
