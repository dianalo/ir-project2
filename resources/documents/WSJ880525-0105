The opposition Liberal and New Democratic parties, which oppose the agreement, said they will use every parliamentary procedural tactic to delay passage of the bill by the House of Commons.    The legislation also is expected to face serious hurdles in the Senate, Parliament's appointed upper chamber, which is controlled by the Liberals.    Despite the opposition, Trade Minister John Crosbie said the federal government intends to have the legislation enacted before &quot;summer is out.&quot; The U.S. Congress, which is considering similar legislation to implement the agreement in the U.S., intends to take a final vote before its August recess.    The trade pact, which was signed Jan. 2 by President Reagan and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, provides for a gradual elimination of all tariffs and many other trade barriers between the two countries, starting Jan. 1.    Mr. Mulroney's Conservative government is expected to be able to eventually push the trade legislation through the House of Commons because of its big majority there. But it could face more difficulties in the Senate. If the Liberal majority in that body tries to block the bill, Mr. Crosbie warned it would provoke &quot;a constitutional crisis.&quot; Bills can become law only if they are approved in the same form by the House of Commons and the Senate.    The trade agreement is opposed by the governments of two of Canada's 10 provinces, Ontario and Prince Edward Island. Some of the other provinces, while favoring closer trade ties with the U.S., are concerned that the pact will infringe on their rights.    Mr. Crosbie said the federal government was &quot;well aware of their {provincial} sensitivities&quot; and wasn't trying to use the trade agreement to &quot;strong arm&quot; the provinces. But he acknowledged that some provinces won't &quot;like our exercise of power&quot; under a clause of the implementing legislation that would allow the federal government to make regulations to assure the agreement's implementation in any province.    The U.S. Senate Finance Committee has warned that the agreement won't be implemented in the U.S. until Congress has clear evidence that the provinces will be bound by the pact's terms.    To implement the agreement, Mr. Crosbie said only one change is needed in a business that usually comes under provincial jurisdiction. That change concerns price markups and the listing for sale of U.S. wine and liquor sold in provincial government retail outlets. The Ontario government has said it won't change its procedures to conform with the trade agreement. The U.S. has complained that the provincially owned stores, which handle large volumes of wine and liquor, discriminate against U.S. brands.    Mr. Crosbie said the legislation provides for federal regulations to bring listing and markups for wine and liquor into conformity with the trade agreement by Dec. 31. &quot;We are confident that this is within Parliament's power,&quot; he said.    Ontario Premier David Peterson has warned that he may challenge the trade legislation in court if he considers that it infringes on provincial jurisdiction in wine and liquor pricing and other areas. Mr. Peterson asserts that Canada will gain little from the proposed trade pact. But the latest opinion poll shows a substantial majority of Canadians continue to favor the agreement. </TEXT></DOC>
