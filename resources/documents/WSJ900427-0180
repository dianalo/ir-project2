Instead, he suggests that &quot;relationships,&quot;both within a company and between a company and its clients,are what really matter.   He is right on that count, but he demonstrates a lack ofunderstanding of what the Information Revolution is allabout: using technology to exploit information for a wholehost of reasons -- strategic planning, corporateintelligence, improving management and production, betterintegrating functions within the company, projecting thecompany's image, and, of course, improving internalcommunications and client services (read &quot;relationships&quot;).</LP><TEXT>   On the other hand, when Mr. Schrage slams CIOs (chiefinformation officers), he unwittingly hits the nail on thehead. Today, most CIOs do not manage information; they manageinformation technology -- hardware, networks, integration andso on. In fact, most CIOs are nothing more than glorified(and well-paid) technicians. They lay the roadwork, directthe traffic and do repair work. As long as information makesit to its final destination, the CIO has succeeded. That'sthe problem.   Information is a strategic asset only when it is properlyexploited. Getting tailored information to the right peopleis a technical problem; using that information is a strategicproblem. A company's CIO, then, ought to be the company's topstrategic planner, someone who understands the value ofcritical information and how to exploit informationtechnology for the benefit of the company -- to beat thecompetition, to increase the efficiency of company operations(and raise profits), and, yes, to improve the &quot;relationships&quot;inside the company and with its clients.   Stephen Aubin   John M. Olin Fellow in Defense Journalism   Boston University   Boston   ---   The relationships between individuals withinorganizations, specifically people responsible for providinginformation, are critical to management. These individualsare oftentimes referred to as &quot;information providers.&quot; Arelatively new technology has been emerging over the pastseveral years called executive information systems, whichprovide executives (I define executives as Peter Druckerdoes, as &quot;knowledge based workers&quot;) with information fromwhich they might better manage an organization.   The concept of executive information systems is not new.In fact, the idea of providing information for high-levelindividuals within an organization is as old as informationtechnology itself. It's a good idea. Unfortunately, it haspreviously failed for various reasons, not the least of whichwas a lack of attention paid to the relationships mentionedin Mr. Schrage's article. Not considering the roles thatinformation providers play in the political environmentwithin an organization does a disservice not only to theorganization and these providers but to informationtechnology as well. Without interaction between executivesand information providers, management expectations gounchecked, and the information system does not contain theinformation the executive needs.   But if the relationships between people are incorporatedinto an organization's technology plan, then an executiveinformation system can encourage productive interaction. Bygiving executives access to internal and external data ofalmost any kind, executives and providers are both focused onthe same information and can spend more time solving problemsrather than trying to locate them. Executive informationsystem technology provides a means for information providersand executives to communicate in a way that does not inhibitthose who are computer literate or savvy, nor does itpreclude those who have no computer expertise fromparticipating.
