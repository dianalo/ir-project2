(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Florida Supreme Court will heararguments this week in a custody battle between a child's biologicaland adoptive parents in a case that could curtail privately arrangedadoptions in the state.   The court is being asked to decide if a man who virtually ignoredhis pregnant girlfriend after she refused to have an abortion canretain the right to challenge her decision to put the baby up foradoption. The man began the challenge shortly after the baby wasborn two years ago, and he also later reconciled with and marriedthe mother.   Arguments were scheduled to be heard Tuesday, with a rulingexpected in about a month.   ``Certainly, it would concern me if the court was to say thebiological father could show up at any point and have the adoptionoverturned,'' said Greg Coler, state secretary of health andrehabilitative services. ``It puts the chance of establishingpermanency for the child at great risk.''   Paternal rights in adoptions have been in the legal spotlightrecently in several states. Last week, the U.S. Supreme Court hearda California case in which a man sought visitation rights to his7-year-old daughter given up for adoption.   In the Florida case, court documents use assumed names, callingthe adoptive parents Bob and Jane Doe and the biological parentsRichard and Mary Roe.   Mary gave upthe child up for adoption within 48 hours of hisbirth. Richard, who initially had refused to get married and hadurged an abortion, then hired a lawyer, acknowledged paternity andsought to halt the adoption.   Richard and Mary were reconciled, and married when the baby was 2months old.   In June 1987, a judge ruled against Roe, saying he hadeffectively abandoned the child during Mary's pregnancy. Theadoptive parents provided an apartment, paid her medical costs andgave her $300 a month for expenses.   A state appeals court reversed the ruling in March, saying thefather's consent was necessary in a privately arranged adoption.However, the appeals court left the boy with his adoptive parentsuntil the Supreme Court could review the case.   Attorney Michael Carbo said a decision for Roe could mean the endof privately arranged adoptions.   ``If the putative father could come in and essentially negate theentire adoption proceeding, because of the fact he wasn't consultedor he didn't know he was the father at the time, would you invest asignificant amount of time and money in the expenses surrounding thebirth?'' he asked.</TEXT></DOC>
