A BMW in every driveway might thrill investors in theshort run but ultimately could dissipate the prestige thatlures buyers to these luxury cars. When Eberhard von Kuenheimtook over as BMW chief executive in 1970, the companyproduced just 160,000 cars. The 1991 level was 553,000. Inthat period, sales have surged to a staggering 30 billionmarks ($18.5 billion) from just 1.7 billion marks.</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. von Kuenheim knows he can't rely on past successesalone to carry BMW into the future. He's looking for ways tokeep the company firmly in the fast lane, includingdiversifying into jet engines, cutting costs at expensiveGerman plants, and looking for lower-cost production sitesabroad. And market saturation is far from the only threat toBMW's continued success. Though Mr. von Kuenheim plays itdown, the surprising success of the Japanese in theluxury-car market has helped put BMW on the alert.   Mr. von Kuenheim, 62 years old, is now studying a range ofoptions to improve his company's cost structure, includingassembling cars in the U.S. or even Mexico. No decision hasbeen made, but simply contemplating such a move marks animportant shift. &quot;It's our task,&quot; he says, &quot;to think theunthinkable.&quot;   Such soul searching is new for BMW -- and for Mr. vonKuenheim. For years, the company seemed supremely satisfiedwith itself. And with good reason. BMW has pulled in profitand retained its independence while other luxury names, suchas Porsche AG or Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar Cars Ltd., havestumbled or been gobbled up by bigger companies.   &quot;BMW is probably the best-managed car company in Europe,&quot;says Dagmar Bottenbruch, auto analyst at Credit Suisse FirstBoston in Milan.   While BMW has done well sticking to its established path,it isn't immune to problems looming ahead for the autoindustry. The Japanese are coming on strong in Europe, andthey already have established a foothold in BMW's luxurysector, especially in the troubled U.S. market.   U.S. sales of BMWs slipped 16% last year, to 53,000 cars.That was a better performance than the other three majorGerman luxury-car makers, but it still worries Mr. vonKuenheim, who says no serious global player can afford toturn its back on the U.S. market.   More troubling for a company like BMW, however, is the waythe luxury sector itself is evolving. It was once thought asmall band of mainly European companies would dominate thetop end of the market for years to come -- simply because oftheir established reputations and aura of exclusivity.According to this view, the Japanese would need at least adecade to build name recognition and market share. But theJapanese have done well introducing new high-priced models,such as Toyota's Lexus and Nissan's Infiniti.   Few people were more startled by this than Mr. vonKuenheim. Urbane and aristocratic, he used to dismiss theJapanese almost without discussion. He still sniffs at theway they create trendy new names for their luxury models.&quot;We're not in the situation where we are forced to invent newnames,&quot; he says. He insists BMW only has one &quot;truecompetitor&quot; -- Germany's Mercedes-Benz AG, a Daimler-Benz AGunit.   Says one European auto analyst: &quot;He doesn't want to givethe impression of being scared of the Japanese, becausecustomers and investors will pick up on that.&quot; Still, it'sclear Mr. von Kuenheim's assessment of the Japanese challengehas changed. &quot;The Japanese are competitors, without anyquestion,&quot; he says, &quot;as are the Italians or the French.&quot;   Says Mr. von Kuenheim, &quot;Our people should not believe thatthey have the right to be a winner forever.&quot; But growth aloneisn't the answer. While 1991 profit is expected to top the1990 record of 696 million marks, he says putting too manyBMWs on the road could hurt the image.   He also is cautious about diversification. In 1990, BMWlinked up with Britain's Rolls-Royce PLC jet engine company-- to develop engines for 130-seat commuter jets. But Mr. vonKuenheim emphasizes this will remain a peripheral activityfor BMW. It won't become a &quot;millstone&quot; around BMW's neck, hepromises.   Against this background, BMW seems set to keep focusing onits core auto business. One big advantage at the moment isthe company's success in updating its range of models,including the new 3series, which accounts for 58% of BMW'ssales. If the new 3-series had flopped, BMW might not be ableto invest in the next generation of designs -- because thecost of developing new cars has soared.   Such successes also make it easier for Mr. von Kuenheim toconsider bold moves, such as setting up foreign production.It's clear one reason BMW is looking overseas is the problemsit faces in the U.S. High wage levels and other productioncosts at BMW's three German plants -- together with theweakness of the dollar against the mark -- have pushed BMW'sprice tags out of reach for many Americans. Importers alsoface a 10% tax in the U.S. on cars costing more than $30,000.   Earlier this month, the company confirmed it was scoutingfor building sites near Anderson, S.C. Clearly, assemblingcars in the U.S. would let BMW trim prices, but Mr. vonKuenheim insists it's too early to know whether any foreigninvestment makes sense. &quot;All the Europeans who tried toproduce motor cars in the U.S.A. had no success,&quot; he says.&quot;Only the Japanese had success.&quot;   And Mr. von Kuenheim is acutely aware that his cars areclosely identified with their &quot;Made in Germany&quot; label. But hesays the increasing globalization of the auto market ismaking this less relevant.   One of BMW's biggest cost-cutting challenges is highproduction costs in Germany, where workers are among thehighest paid in the industrialized world. Mr. von Kuenheimalready is trimming costs. The company recently said it wouldcut 3,000 jobs at its German plants to boost productivity.But analysts say BMW will need to do more to offset risingwages.   Part of Mr. von Kuenheim's strategy is being implementedat BMW's sprawling factory outside Regensburg, just north ofhere. Built in the late 1980s at a cost of 1.7 billion marks,the factory is BMW's answer to the Japanese. The plantintegrates the latest technology and production techniques,including Japanese-style just-in-time parts deliveries andteam production, but with a German twist. BMW spent millionsmaking the plant &quot;worker-friendly.&quot; Many difficult tasks wereautomated or made easier through the use, for example, ofmachines that tip cars for easier access by workers.   Also, BMW managed to establish a shift system that allowsthe factory to operate six days a week, boostingproductivity.   Mr. von Kuenheim says places like Regensburg showEuropeans are well-positioned to compete with the Japanese.&quot;I think that this decade will be the decade of Europe, andnot of East Asia,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
