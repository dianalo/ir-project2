One corporate defense against hostile takeovers involves the issuance to shareholders of rights to buy more stock at a big discount in the event of one; it's a &quot;poison-pill&quot; strategy. Yet the tax status of such rights has been unclear: Are they taxable dividends or tax-free stock &quot;attributes&quot;? Now, Robert Willens of Shearson Lehman Brothers sees in private ruling 8739053 the first clue to the IRS's thinking -- and he finds it favorable.    Poison-pill rights aren't the crux of the ruling, which says one unidentified concern's acquisition of another was through a tax-free stock exchange. But the acquirer's stock carries such rights. If the IRS deems them taxable, it would have held that recipients of the stock had gain equal to the rights' value, Willens says; thus, he sees &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; of the IRS's view.    Great Western Financial Corp. confirms that it got the ruling in connection with its acquisition of Southern Home Savings Bank.    TAX-BILL HEAT could melt estate value &quot;freezes&quot; used by family concerns.    The owner of a corporation can cut potential estate tax with this maneuver: He gives common stock to his children, freezing asset values for them as of then; future appreciation in value escapes gift or estate tax. But he keeps his income and control through preferred stock. Now the proposed House tax bill would bar such maneuvers for anyone who owns 10% or more of a corporation's voting power or income stream:    If an owner gave a disproportionate share of appreciation and kept disproportionate control or income, the transferred interest would still be counted in his estate (freezes in effect by last Oct. 13 would be exempt). Byrle Abbin of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co., CPAs, says the measure could disrupt family ownership by forcing an estate to sell a concern to pay estate tax.    SOFTWARE BUGS delay IRS use of new data-retrieval processors into 1988.    A $150 million replacement of computers and terminals used in the 10 service centers to keep tabs on taxpayer accounts has slipped again. Congress's General Accounting Office said Oct. 8 that as of mid-August, the first processor usage, at Fresno, had been put back five weeks to Dec. 2; the GAO was concerned then about pushing installations into the 1988 return-filing season. Now Assistant Commissioner Capozolli says the Fresno start-up has been reset for Jan. 9 -- if Sysorex Information Systems supplies improved software this week for testing.    Only as each system proves out, Capozolli adds, will the IRS proceed to start-ups now set for Austin March 4, Atlanta late in April, and elsewhere by 1988's end -- about a year later than originally planned. The new units aren't involved in returns processing and won't disrupt it, he says. Old systems will be on &quot;hot standby,&quot; usable in a day or two for account updating and taxpayer inquiries if problems arise.    By 1987's end, the IRS will have replaced 3,300 obsolete inquiry terminals and raised the number of terminals in use to 9,080 from 8,200.    THE IRS WON'T INSIST that a taxpayer attend the first audit interview after all, if a knowledgeable representative is there. Commissioner Gibbs announced the policy change to the American Institute of CPAs. It and others had protested an IRS &quot;re-emphasis&quot; on taxpayer interviews.    A CORPORATION SELLING stock of a consolidated subsidiary for a profit may be able to use present rules to trim tax, under the Tax Court's 1985 decision for Woods Investment Co. Now the House and Senate tax bills would block further benefits stemming from that decision.    QUALITY IMPROVEMENT is the goal of a pact between the National Treasury Employees Union and the IRS, the first of its kind in federal government. The IRS will train union leaders and members for problem-solving councils composed of management and employees at each IRS location.    RELIEF IS SPELLED &quot;F-i-l-e e-a-r-l-y,&quot; say the IRS's ad folks.    McCann-Erickson has provided a preview of its public-service campaign for the IRS. The theme: &quot;Make Your Taxes Less Taxing.&quot; The aim: To get taxpayers to &quot;do it now and do it accurately.&quot; The payoff for them, says the agency's Steve Hurwitz, will be the &quot;relief&quot; they feel when the stamp goes on the envelope and the envelope goes in the mailbox. By about Jan. 15, the agency plans to distribute the first round of TV and radio spots, print advertising, and outdoor and transit postings.    One TV spot will show a man waking to a &quot;Spielbergian&quot; light emanating from a drawer. &quot;It looks like there's something horrible in there,&quot; says Hurwitz, but it's just a tax return waiting to be done. When the job is over, the man grins with relief and realizes that &quot;the monster&quot; was his own creation. The ads combine emotional and intellectual appeals, Hurwitz says: &quot;They don't preach, they make you feel.&quot;    Ad creators try to focus on the benefit to the consumer, he notes, &quot;and that's not so easy here.&quot;    BRIEFS: Neither the House bill nor the Senate's would extend expiring tax breaks for two employee benefits: educational aid and group legal services . . . . IRS Revenue Ruling 87-106 lists home modifications that are deductible as medical costs. . . . The IRS has received 1.6 million order forms for its free booklet on personal-tax changes and filled 1.1 million of them. </TEXT></DOC>
