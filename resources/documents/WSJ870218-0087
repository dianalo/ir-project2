A shadowy, elegant man of uncertain nationality, Mr. Maurier is one of the most unscrupulous arbitragers ever to violate a stock-market confidence. People who know him say insider trading comes as naturally to him as breathing and sleeping.    Until now, he has operated in absolute secrecy. But, in a few weeks, the public will learn the details of a shocking takeover scheme involving a former U.S. senator, one of Denver's most glamorous oil tycoons and Mr. Maurier.    Believe it or not, insider trading is about to have its debut on &quot;Dynasty.&quot; Next month, the prime-time TV soap opera will unveil its newest villain -- the evil arbitrager Maurier. And a cast of characters already preoccupied with arson, amnesia and unrequited lust now will also have to contend with securities-law violations.    The rest of America may abhor insider trading, but Hollywood loves it. Producers and actors were racing to make movies and TV shows about Wall Street crime before the ink dried on Ivan Boesky's plea-bargaining agreement.    Madcap insider-trading comedies and searing insider-trading dramas are in the works. Comedian Chevy Chase and Warner Bros. recently paid more than a million dollars for rights to a story about an invisible insider trader. Oliver Stone, the director of the current Vietnam War movie &quot;Platoon,&quot; has been spending a lot of time in New York and Washington having secret meetings with corporate raiders and takeover lawyers. He is boning up on the subject for his next movie.    &quot;It's a very glamorous world that is now perceived as very sexy,&quot; says Scott Rudin, the president of motion-picture production of Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp. &quot;When people hear about these giant sums of money traded in seconds, I see saliva forming and eyes growing wide.&quot;    Mr. Stone is about to start filming &quot;Wall Street,&quot; the story of a rookie stockbroker who learns secret details of a big takeover battle. Michael Mann, the creator of television's &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;Crime Story,&quot; is at work on a Wall Street drama tentatively entitled &quot;Young and Indicted.&quot;    The Chevy Chase project is a first novel by H.F. Saint called &quot;Memoirs of an Invisible Man.&quot; It is about a securities analyst who becomes invisible and makes a fortune trading on information he picks up by sneaking into takeover strategy sessions.    In the same comic vein, independent producers Peter Bart and Paul Bluhdorn are developing a farce called &quot;Filthy Rich.&quot; In it, a hapless young Wall Streeter is accosted with stock-market secrets by his girlfriend, his parking-lot attendant, strangers in the men's room and runners in Central Park.    Associates of Robert Redford say he is developing a Wall Street thriller. And the former head of Motown's motion-picture division recently took an option on R. Foster Winans's book about his own involvement with insider trading as a Wall Street Journal reporter. The producer, Arnold Orgolini, says he is talking seriously with Gore Vidal about writing the screenplay.    Not long ago, Hollywood held its nose when it thought about the world of finance. The last big Wall Street movie was &quot;Rollover,&quot; a 1981 Jane Fonda picture with a tangled plot about petrodollars and the collapse of the international monetary system. The film was a flop, financially and critically.    But with the recent headlines about Mr. Boesky and the other fallen insider traders, Wall Street's stock is at an alltime high in Hollywood. Michael Shamberg, a developer of &quot;Young and Indicted,&quot; says, &quot;Wall Street has always been pretty faceless. But once the financial world became the world of celebrities and personalities, that was the vocabulary we could understand out here.&quot;    (As producer of &quot;The Big Chill,&quot; Mr. Shamberg is a pioneer of sorts in the cinematic history of Wall Street crime, since a scene in that 1983 movie involves the first leak of illegal inside information on film that movie people can remember. It occurs as the actor Kevin Kline, out for a morning jog with his down-and-out friend William Hurt, discloses that his sneaker company, Running Dog, is about to be taken over. He implies that it might just be a good time to invest a few bucks.)    Now, producers breathlessly drop financial arcana as if they were movie stars' first names. &quot;I'm fascinated by greenmail and poison pills,&quot; says Esther Shapiro, the executive producer of &quot;Dynasty&quot; and the creator of Dirk Maurier.    Mrs. Shapiro and her staff won't say much about Dirk until details are disclosed to one and all in March. &quot;He's an Ivan Boesky-like character,&quot; promises a &quot;Dynasty&quot; publicist. &quot;He's definitely a junk-bond specialist.&quot;    Equally tight-lipped is Mr. Stone, who postponed plans to make a Mexican cowboy movie so he could rush ahead with &quot;Wall Street.&quot; All he will say about the film is that &quot;it's an examination of the old values and the new values. I don't want to reveal too much because of all these other projects.&quot;    But sources close to &quot;Wall Street&quot; say a recent draft of the script tells the story of a young stockbroker who rises in his firm by trading on inside information about the company his father works for. His career takes a dramatic turn when his father's company becomes the target of a corporate raider's hostile takeover bid. The raider is said to be based loosely on Carl Icahn.    Mr. Stone has reportedly been talking to Tom Cruise and Matthew Broderick about the starring role, but &quot;Platoon&quot; star Charlie Sheen is said to be the top contender for the part.    The son of a New York stockbroker, Mr. Stone has been consulting on his screenplay with an array of real-life Wall Street powers. Among his sources: takeover specialist Asher Edelman; Dennis Block, a prominent raiders' lawyer whose clients include Mr. Icahn; and the two government investigators who broke the Boesky case, Gary Lynch of the Securities and Exchange Commission and federal prosecutor Charles Carberry.    Mr. Stone also put two experts on his payroll as technical advisers: a defense lawyer in last year's &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; insider-trading case and a broker in E.F. Hutton's Beverly Hills, Calif., office. &quot;I personally have always felt -- and I know this movie will prove it -- that the stockbrokerage business is very dramatic,&quot; says the Hutton broker-adviser, Fredric Havens. &quot;What's coming up on all those machines? It's money! And that's exciting to an audience.&quot;    Not everyone on Wall Street would agree. &quot;I can't imagine anyone wanting to do a movie about this,&quot; admits Mr. Edelman. &quot;I find it very unglamorous.&quot;    &quot;It's not surprising someone wants to make a movie about insider trading and takeovers,&quot; says Mr. Block. &quot;But I doubt there'll be a scene where someone is eating a turkey sandwich at the printer's waiting for page proofs of a tender offer.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
