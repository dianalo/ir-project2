<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-17-0382 </DOCNO><TEXT>A cruise was completed to measure the vertical distributions of plantbiomass, growth, size and species composition, nutritional content andthe zooplankton biomass and species composition. There were no consistentdifferences in the size spectra of particles between the regions of highestplant biomass and highest growth rates. Species known to be noxious ordistasteful to the zooplankton were not members of either assemblage.The nutritional content of the particulate matter was greatest at theplant biomass maximum. Thus there was no evidence that the region ofhigher plant growth rates was a better place for zooplankton to feed.The diurnal distribution of zooplankton biomass was not consistentlyrelated to the vertical distributions of plant biomass, primary productivity,or productivity/chlorophyll. At night, the vertical distribution of zooplanktonbiomass was consistently related to the vertical distribution of plantbiomass. There were species whose vertical distributions were consistentlyrelated to either the vertical distribution of plant biomass or productivity/chlorophylla but not primary productivity, contrary to the observations of others.The total grazing pressure, measured in situ with a new design of grazingchamber and an isotopic carrier which labels the particulate matter dayand night, indicated that the daily production of plant carbon was muchgreater than its rate of removal by the grazers. Thus, it is not necessaryfor the grazer biomass maximum to be located above the chlorophyll amaximum in order for that feature to persist.</TEXT></DOC>
