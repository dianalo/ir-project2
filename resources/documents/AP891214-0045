(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Opponents of a proposed radioactive wastedump claimed a first-round victory after chasing members of a stateteam scouting for sites through snowy fields and holding themcaptive for four hours.   Protesters were ready to be arrested Wednesday, but state policeagreed instead to file trespassing charges against members of afield team from the state Low-Level Radioactive Waste SitingCommission.   Protest organizers said they were ready to block inspection oftwo other potential dump sites in Allegany County today if thefield team returned.   Also Wednesday, 20 protesters were arrested on disorderlyconduct charges in Cortland County, 100 miles to the east, whenthey refused to allow a state inspection team to leave one of twopotential sites there.   Anti-dump activists in both counties have been camping out allweek at the five proposed dump sites, watching for the stateinspectors.   Dump opponents fanned out along the edges of the Allegany sitesat dawn, armed with citizens band radios, portable heaters andthermoses on sleds as they waited throughout the morning infreezing weather.   Bill Mura, who lives near one potential site, opened his home asa rest area and warming station for protesters.   ``We moved out here 22 years ago to get away from it all,'' Murasaid, gesturing toward the hilly, forested countryside. ``This iswhat we get thrown at us.''   His house, like almost every building in Allegany and Cortlandcounties, bears a fluorescent orange sign reading ``No Dumping _Don't Waste New York.''   The five sites were chosen by the commission in September. Underfederal law, states must have a place to store low-levelradioactive waste by 1993.   The commission plans to complete soil testing and otherpreliminary evaluations by spring and then narrow the number ofsites to two or three for more comprehensive tests.   Allegany protesters planned to block the state field team fromgetting on the sites Wednesday, but the team was not spotted untilit was already on the site in the town of Allen at about 12:30 p.m.   Several dozen people tracked the officials' footprints throughthe fresh snow, chasing them up and down wooded hills until theysurrounded seven team members on a county road.   About 100 protesters linked arms and formed a human chain toprevent the officials from leaving the site.   Allegany County Sheriff Lawrence Scholes, who has no deputiesother than jail officials, called in state police.   The two officers who arrived made no arrests.   ``At this point in time I don't see a need for arrests,'' Lt.Charles McCole said. ``What I see is a group of concernedcitizens.''   Dump opponents produced landowner William Giovanniello, who saidthe state team had failed to give him notice that they would be onhis land and asked that its members be arrested for trespassing.   ``They never notified me,'' Giovanniello said. ``No phone call,no nothing.''   Commission staff member Bruce Goodale called Giovanniello'scharge ``absolute, sheer nonsense.''   Police and protesters began an hour of negotiations, with thedump opponents demanding that the state team be arrested beforethey would allow them to leave.   The protesters eventually agreed to let the team members leaveafter Giovanniello signed a complaint against them and police filedcharges with the district attorney's office.   Exuberant protesters whooped and hollered ``See you in themorning,'' as the team members were allowed to return to their cars.   Jay Dunkleberger, executive director of the siting commission,said he did not consider Wednesday's events a victory for theprotesters.   ``I consider it a draw,'' he said. ``We did accomplish the taskwe set for ourselves for the day.''</TEXT></DOC>
