 &quot;In all honesty, I hope it never gets here,&quot; said a data centerexecutive at a large insurance company.andP;  &quot;I can't see that there's anythingin it for me but headaches.&quot;andM;While the initial SAA software architecture blueprint announced in 1987 didlittle to address the work of data center managers, IBM is now articulating amirror image of AD/Cycle aimed at data center managers, systems programmers,technical support staff and operators.andM;SAA up to now has primarily addressed the needs of end users and programmers.andO;For end users, the Common User Access user interface promises that futureapplications will look and behave in much the same way.andP;  For programmers, theCommon Programming Interface offers the long-sought lingua franca, a set astandard languages and services that lets both programs and programmers movefreely among IBM computer environments.andM;The Common Communications Support (CCS) SAA interface promotes peer-to-peernetworking among different machines.andP;  CCS offers both users and developersthe benefits of a cooperating network of machines--speed, efficiency andflexibility.andM;&quot;SAA is for end users, vendors, Case tool builders, applicationprogrammers--people interested in cross-platform solutions,&quot; said MarioMorino of Legent Corporation, Vienna, Va.andP;  &quot;But for systems people, SAArepresents a real culture gap.andP;  They're not acclimated to any of itsprinciples.andP;  It hasn't got much for them yet.&quot;andM;What will SAA mean to data center administrators?andP;  They are the ones who keepthe machines up and running.andP;  They monitor the activities and performance ofthe information system, and make sure the data in the database is availablebut secure.andP;  These folks also distribute, configure and update the hardwareand software; project future needs and recommend purchases; and areresponsible for keeping the IS department on schedule, on budget and ontrack.andP;  Current wisdom says that SAA promises little that could make theirjobs easier, and much that could make them harder.andM;If SAA succeeds in making distributed processing the industry standard, datacenter management is sure to become a more complicated endeavor.andP;  Most datacenter managers still live in a world where the mainframe is king, computersare self-contained and data processing resources are under tight controlinside a centralized &quot;glass house.&quot;andM;SAA threatens to distribute these resources across heterogeneous environmentsall over the countryside.andP;  Applications that span networks of cooperatingplatforms require at least as much centralized control as old-styleapplications while presenting new-style challenges.andM;&quot;I feel like all my kids are going off the college,&quot; said one manager, &quot;andyet I'm expected to keep as close control over them as I did when they alllived at home.&quot;andM;Terry Lowder, vice president for technology research at BancOne ServicesCorporation in Columbus, Ohio, agrees that data center managers face &quot;a majorparadigm shift, thinking in terms of a global network of peer processorsinstead of just the one mainframe.&quot;andP;  But he also believes that &quot;systemmanagement people just need to be shown what the advantages are, how SystemsApplication Architecture can let them maintain control and improve service.&quot;andM;If IBM can come up with cooperative tools for managing cooperative systems,&quot;they will take a lot of pressure off the mainframe, especially wherescheduling is concerned,&quot; according to Lowder.andM;IBM's SYSTEM MANAGEMENT PROJECTandM;Such tools are on their way.andP;  User input, especially from Guide and Share,IBM mainframe user groups headquartered in Chicago, has convinced IBM thatSAA will face powerful resistance unless tools to help manage data in adistributed environment have been announced by the time that major SAAapplications start hitting the data center.andM;Talk of a significant IBM initiative on the data center has been circulatingin the computer press for some months now.andP;  IBM executives have dropped broadhints in this direction at recent user group meetings, and an officialannouncement is expected within the year.andM;In the meantime, preliminary information from IBM executives, informedspeculation from consultants and extrapolation from previous IBM solutionsmake it possible to sketch the outlines of IBM's plans.andM;We know that IBM has established a System Management &quot;cluster&quot; to tackle theproblem.andP;  This cluster is one of 13 interdisciplinary task forces IBM hasformed to deal with the complex issues that SAA's cross-system architectureraises; other clusters include user interface, security, cooperativeprocessing and transaction processing.andM;NETWORKING IS KEYandM;Don Haile, enterprise, system director of software systems at IBM, heads theSystem Management cluster.andP;  He described his group's charter this way: &quot;Wewill provide the programs, processes and procedures that will led anenterprise plan, alter, operate and deliver information system servicesaccording to its own business needs and policies.&quot;andP;  The system they willeventually deliver has no officially announced name; it will be called SSA/SMfor the purposes of this article.andM;According to Haile, SAA/SM will cover six distinct management areas:configuration, change, problem solving, automation, performance and business.andO;These divisions may sound familiar; they are very much like the categoriesused to describe network management under NetView.andP;  (NetView is IBM's networkmanagement product under Systems Network Architecture, IBM's datacommunications architecture.)andM;This similarity is neither coincidence nor plagiarism, but rather more proofthat under SAA, system management means network management.andP;  SAA's mostprofound effect will be to make the network the basic unit of system design.andO;(In the words of one SAA theorist: &quot;You won't program or use the computeranymore, you'll program or use the network.&quot;)andM;To get an idea of how SAA and the data center will interact in the future, wewill look briefly at each of Haile's six SAA/SM areas in terms of theproblems that SAA presents, the possible solutions and what--if anything--weknow of IBM's plans.andM;Configuration Management.andP;  Configuring, and continually reconfiguring, thecomputing environment has become so complex that it is now a specialty untoitself.andP;  Configuration is understood and controlled by the system programmer,the high priest of the &quot;glass house&quot; who works his or her secrettransformations on hardware and software that is hidden from the view ofordinary users.andM;When PCs began appearing in organizations, they lived outside the systemprogrammer's control.andP;  Very little configuration expertise was necessary toget a one-user desktop environment up and running--one reason that PCs caughton with such astounding speed.andM;As PC use became widespread, PC software grew more complex.andP;  PCs begancoalescing into LANs and configuration soon got complicated again.andP;  Mostorganizations have had to form special PC support staffs to help in theorderly installation and configuration of PC LANs.andM;Now SAA decrees that the always-complex mainframes and the newly complex PCsare supposed to interact, seamlessly sharing data and function.andP;  Centralizedconfiguration control is more vital than ever, but now the configurableelements are spread out in dozens, if not hundreds, of sites.andM;SAA/SM will have to provide a centralized, uniform method of configuring themany layers of these complex networks: mainframes to communications links toLAN servers to PCs.andP;  This SAA configuration environment will include:andM;* a uniform definition of configuration data across the various systems;andM;* a common repository for the configuration data, most likely that emergingcentral warehouse of SAA &quot;meta-data,&quot; the big-R Repository;andM;* an ability to share this configuration data among the various entities ofthe SAA network--people, platforms and processes; andandM;* the capability to dynamically update the configuration.andM;In addition, according to IBM's Haile, SAA/SM will include a number ofadvanced configuration features.andP;  For example, &quot;We'll let you propose andeven model possible configurations,&quot; he said, giving data center managers thechance to see the impact of a certain configuration before actually puttingit in place.andM;Change Management.andP;  Although business evangelists preach the importance ofembracing change, the C-word has always struck fear into the hearts of systemmanagers.andM;Even in today's standalone computer environments, managing change is adaunting activity.andP;  It includes planning, distributing, installing andtracking all the system changes required to keep the computing environmentalive and productive.andP;  When SAA-style distributed processing arrives with itscross-platform distributed computing environment, the job will be many timesmore difficult.andM;Here is an example.andP;  It is well known that changing a table definition inIBM's DB2 database management system can create fatal inconsistencies betweenvarious system components.andP;  These problems are so widespread that a number ofplatform-specific third-party tools have appeared to determine the impaact ofDB2 application changes and to automatically rebuilt parts of theapplication.andP;  In the future, when databases distribute according to the SAAmodel and the potential inconsistencies inevitably multiply, newcross-platform tools of enormous complexity will be needed to sort them cut.andM;&quot;IBM keeps showing up charts that promote 'any-to-any' connectivity amongDB2, SQL/DS, SQL/400 and OS2/DM,&quot; said Howard Fosdick, a Villa Park, Ill.,andO;consultant and chairman of the International DB2 Users' Group (IDUG).andP;  &quot;Buttoday the tools for the database administrator all work differently on thedifferent platforms.andP;  How are we going to administer SAA's distributeddatabase?&quot;andM;Cynthia Dwyer, a systems analyst with the Data Administration Group at AmocoCorp., Chicago, is worried about one aspect of change management.andP;  &quot;Gettingsoftware to remote locations in a reasonable amount of time, and legally, isalready a full-time job around here,&quot; she said.andP;  &quot;We can't keep handing outdiskettes.&quot;andM;Haile acknowledged that &quot;there are a great many workstations out there, andthe distribution problem is compounded by different kinds of LANs.&quot;andP;  Hepromises a solution &quot;honed to the business reality of software distribution,including license management.&quot;andP;  Haile would not commit to a time frame, butindustry observers expect a software distribution solution probably beforethe end of the year.andM;Problem Management.andP;  The problem management job is to provide cradle-to-gravehandling of system problems, preferably bringing the problem to its gravebefore the system or the management.andP;  We can expect an SAA/SM approach tofollow the problem life cycle that has been defined for NetView, namely:andM;* problem determination--detectin the loss or impending loss of service fromsome system resource, and isolating the location of the problem;andM;* problem diagnosis--finding the cause of the problem and figuring out how tofix it, using data from the determination phase, as well as additional datafrom special diagnostic procedures;andM;* problem bypassand recovery--circumventing the problem if possible,especially where priority processes are concerned;andM;* problem resolution--getting the problem fixed; andandM;* problem tracking and control--auditing the problem over the course of itslife to gain knowledge that will make it easier to diagnose or preventsimilar problems in the future.andM;These problem-management steps become trickier as the network increases itsspan.andP;  Not only are problems sure to increase, but they will end up in thelaps of people who are poorly equipped to deal with them.andM;&quot;We're not going to expect users way out on a token-ring to do heavydiagnostics,&quot; Haile said.andP;  &quot;We're going to need to initiate problemmanagement from the central location, even taking control of the user'skeyboard to get to the problem.&quot;andM;Performance Management.andP;  Even a problem-free system will fail to provide goodend-usersolutions if it does not deliver the required level of service.andO;Measuring current system throughput and projecting future throughput rankamong the data center's primary responsibilities.andP;  Making these measurementsand projections in a distributed environment, where the value of a Mips(million instructions per second) varies wildly from platform to platform, issure to be complicated.andM;Measuring current system performance in an SAA environment will involvecapturing the same kind of data, formatted in the same way, on each of theSAA platforms, and then making that data available at a central site foranalysis and reporting.andM;Haile said, &quot;We're going to put as much system information as possible in acommon format.andP;  Part of our job is to define the data model for systemmanagement.&quot;andP;  An even more difficult job will be finding a way to interpretthe data so that it fairly evaluates the performance of a distributed system.andM;Projecting future performance for capacity planning purposes presents otherchallenges.andM;Imagine an MIS organization that wants to commit wholeheartedly to SAA.andO;Imagine that this company typically produces five-year plans so thatmanagement will know when to make capital available for the purchase of newhardware and software.andM;How does the planner begin to project the capacity needed to implement IBM'ssoftware strategy in 1995?andP;  How much hardware will be needed?andP;  Where?andP;  When?andO;With what software?andP;  What communication lines?andM;Apart from the mysteries around how this future hardware and software will bepriced, how much should the planner recommend buying?andM;Large-scale SAA systems will not be put into place until plans are set.andP;  SAAhas said very little explicity or implicitly that acknowledges how a firmneeds to plan and project.andP;  It is now up to SAA/SM to take up the slack.andM;Operations Management.andP;  Over the past decade, large systems users and usergroups have pressured IBM to do more about automating computer operations.andO;&quot;Unattended operations&quot; is on Guide's &quot;Top Concerns&quot; list.andP;  A large MVS shopprocesses 4,000 to 6,000 operator messages per day--all of which are handledmanually--to mount tapes, track down problems and answer questions.andM;&quot;You'd hardly believe it,&quot; said Arnold Farber, president and principal ofFarber/LaChance, Inc., a Richmond, Va., consulting firm, &quot;but a centralcomputer center is one of the most manual and people-intensive organizationsin the whole company.&quot;andM;Among the routine tasks that could be automated are: job scheduling, librarymanagement, Dasd and print management, and tape movement.andP;  The staffedoperations consold could be significantly automated, possibly throughrobotics according to Farber.andM;&quot;We can aspire to SAA,&quot; Farber said, &quot;but we're never going to see integratedautomated enterprise systems as long as we need a human to press a buttom ona 3090 to do an IMPL.&quot;andM;Operation problems may seem less acute when smaller-sized computers areconcerned: AS/400s can often be left to their own devices; PCs, bydefinition, are meant to be attended.andP;  But, as soon as easy-to-use, smallmachines get joined together into networks, complexity increases.andM;For example, various portions of the network will sometimes need to beremotely operated, perhaps with a remote site driving a mainframe, or perhapsthe opposite, depending on the application, the situation and even the timeof day.andP;  Systematic methods for running the network from the outside in, orfrom the inside out, are an absolute necessity.andM;Business Management.andP;  The business of an information system is business...andthe information system is itself big business.andP;  The SAA/SM solution will makeprovisions for auditing and controlling the business aspects of theinformation system.andM;On the audit side, a data manager needs to collect consistent data fromaround the distributed environment to determine what resources have beenexpended on a given function.andP;  This data can be used for accounting,chargebacks and availability analysis, or it can be combined with performancedata for capacity planning.andM;HOUSEKEEPING CHORESandM;On the control side, the manager needs to register and administer suchnetwork data as user names, passwords, account codes and usage limits.andP;  Noneof these tasks is terribly taxing individually, but putting them into theorderly framework that a distributed environment requires is one of SAA/SM'slarger tasks.andM;Though IBM's System Management cluster has divided data center managementinto six somewhat distinct topics, it would be a mistake to expect sixindividual solutions.andP;  Anyone who has watched IBM's SAA applications expectsSAA/SM to take the shape of an integrated solution framework, similar instructure to AD/Cycle.andP;  (AD/Cycle is IBM's Case/Repository-based frameworkfor application development.)andM;SM/Cycle, or whatever it will be called, will do for data center managementwhat AD/Cycle does for product development--propose standard categories, layout the ways they fit together and enlist products to do the jobs (seesidebar on page 61).andM;As with AD/Cycle--and with SAA itself--we can expect the System Managementsolution to arrive in a couple of steps.andP;  As Legent's Morino said, &quot;A productlivesthrough two cycles: the first to be operable in the new world, thesecond to be applicable in the new world.&quot;andM;Operability in this case will involve simply getting SM facilities andinterfaces defined and implemented on the four SAA platforms.andP;  Only laterwill we see these facilities applied to the task of planning, altering,operating and delivering systems that are not just consistent butcooperative.andM;Amoco's Dwyer said, &quot;I'm afraid some of these systems and tools are muchfarther in the future than we think.andP;  We're in for some disappointments.&quot;andM;IBM's Haile promised, &quot;Some of these issues we're addressing will achievesolutions over the next one to two years.&quot;andM;But he said that a comprehensive solution will take much longer.andP;  &quot;Ourcustomers want us to help them figure out how to manage their new cooperativeenvironments.andP;  We understand this, and we're looking into some aspects of it,but it's a tough one.&quot;andM;SAA will provoke a tough transition for data center people.andP;  The &quot;paradigmshift&quot; that BancOne's Lowder described at the beginning of this article isnever easy.andP;  Administrators may not be able to envision the future benefitsof SAA as easily as programmers or users.andP;  But they will benefit, too.andM;Data center management needs shaking up, according to Alex Lobba, productmanager at Softool Corp. in Goleta, Calif.andP;  &quot;The old policies are stretchedvery thin.andP;  Data centers can't keep ignoring PCs and LANs, for example.andP;  SAAwill force the issue.&quot;andM;Whether or not SAA sweeps the computing world, the era of the &quot;glass house&quot;seems drawing to a close.andP;  Open, distributed systems are inevitable.andP;  If SAAdoes prevail, and if it brings along a set of cooperative system managementtools, organized into a rational structure and linked by standard interfaces,the data center managers cannot help but benefit.andM;Centralized management in a cooperative environment is certain to bechallenging, especially during the long transition phase ahead.andP;  But datacenter managers will end up enjoying the same benefits SAA offers to the restof the community: flexibility, efficiency, connectivity, standardization andpower.andM;Tibbetts is president of Kinexis, a San Francisco-based consulting firmspecializing in cooperative processing issues.andP;  Bernstein, also a principalin Kinexis, is a managing editor of the SAA Update newsletter, published bySystems Education Associates, Dallas.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
