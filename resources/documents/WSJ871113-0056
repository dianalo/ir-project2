The Oct. 29 internal document says some of its funding for AIDS education is already delayed because &quot;this amendment will have major impact&quot; on CDC programs. And, although the measure had widespread support in Congress, some of its original backers have begun efforts to kill it.    The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), and under review by a House-Senate conference committee, says federally funded AIDS education must &quot;emphasize abstinence from sexual activity outside of a monogamous marriage&quot; and can't &quot;encourage, directly or indirectly, homosexual sexual activities.&quot;    The CDC, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the amendment's impact isn't yet clear. But public health officials said it's so broadly written it could devastate efforts to prevent AIDS not only among homosexuals, but among drug addicts, teen-agers, and unmarried people who are sexually active.    &quot;It could result in a loss of federal funding for vitally important education,&quot; said a letter to conference committee members signed by Sens. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and others who originally voted for the amendment. &quot;This clearly was not our intent.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
