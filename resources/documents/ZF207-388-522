(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OBJECT-ORIENTED CELLS BRING NEW LIFE TO DBMSandM;Object-oriented will be the new database structure for the 1990s, say someindustry analysts.andM;Whoa!andP;  Lots of data processing people are just beginning to warm up torelational database management systems.andM;In fact, many MIS professionals have only recently decided--after years ofreview--that is is worthwhile to convert some real bread-and-butter onlineproduction systems from hierarchical to relational databases.andM;And many people out there have not made that decision yet.andP;  Maybe they arethe lucky ones.andP;  Maybe they will get to skip the relational era and jumpright into the next generation of databases.andM;But then, maybe being in a relational database management system (RDBMS) willmake it easier to ease into object-oriented systems.andM;Maybe, ad maybe not.andP;  A few developers say the transition would be easy ifobject-oriented systems become an extension of relational databases, and SQLis extended to accommodate objects.andM;Others are not so sure.andP;  In fact, some developers say that object-orientedtechniques represent a complete change in the way data processing isaccomplished.andP;  They claim the change is so radical that the benefits of thisnew approach will only be realized after they move up a long learning curve.andM;&quot;It's difficult stuff to learn,&quot; acknowledges Dave Pendleton, manager of theArtificial Intelligence Program at the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration (NOAA) in Rockville, Md.andM;&quot;In fact, for experienced programmers, there is a lot of unlearing to do,&quot;Pendleton said.andM;&quot;But once you get up to speed, you have tremendous productivity,&quot; he said.andO;&quot;We are doing things that I would not attempt to do with earlier databasesystems.&quot;andM;Each new database model provides some significant benefits.andP;  When the benefitis significant enough, it becomes worth the time and expense to implement thenew database technology.andM;Now that relational systems are installed, important new ways to access dataare possible.andP;  Natural language interfaces are increasingly appearing forrelational database systems.andP;  These new, ease-of-access capabilities arejustifying the cost of implementing the relational systems.andP;  Equally, or moreimportant, they are offering an enterprise strategic benefit over itscompetitors.andM;Even more dramatic strategic advantages may exist for some enterprises thatmove quickly, shrewdly, and resourcefully into object-oriented systems.andM;The risks of jumping in too soon are similar to the risks of jumping into anynew technology too soon.andP;  It was not until the current second generation ofexport systems arrived that it really paid off for many companies to jumpinto export system technology.andP;  Maybe it is best to wait for the secondgeneration of object-oriented systems as well.andM;But there is a brand-new risk with object-oriented systems.andP;  The risk ofwaiting must be considered just as carefully as the risk of going forward soearly in the game.andP;  The risk of not proceeding now with object-orientedtechnology is that you are potentially giving your competitor a head startthat could prove lethal to your business survival.andM;This unique, new approach has much potential.andM;&quot;We believe that during the next decade, wholesale migration toobject-oriented applicatons throughout the software market is inevitable,&quot;says Randall Sutherland, a former industry analyst at Dataquest, a marketreseach firm based in San Jose, Calif.andM;The concepts of object-oriented technology take a while to absorb in full,but a quick review of the basic concepts reveals some interesting qualities.andM;Objects are combinations of data and procedural code.andP;  The code permits theobject to act upon itself.andP;  Objects belong to calsses and the classes areorganized into a hierarchy.andP;  A class is a general category of objects.andP;  Anobject in one class can inherit attributes and procedures (methods) from thehigher class.andM;Once defined within an enviroment, an object can easily be used by otherapplications.andP;  The objects may be used as originally defined, or a new classmay be created with slightly different attributes and methods.andP;  The mostimportant point is that objects are easily changed and easily shared withinan environment.andM;The major contributions of this new techniques are extensibility, codereusability and the ability to handle substantially different types ofentities within a single database structure.andM;Probably the most dramatic capability of the object-oriented approach is thepotential for reusing code.andM;If object-oriented systems really do come through with the extensive amountof code reusability that the early users are experiencing, this feature alonewill be a tremendous asset.andM;In addition, the extensibility offered by object-oriented systems would makeit much easier to modify systems after they are in production.andP;  This couldhave a major impact on software maintenance.andM;Bertrand Meyer in his new book, Object-Oriented Software Construction(Prentice Hall, New York), discusses the value offered by object-orientedsystems in software maintenance.andM;He feels that traditional approaches emphasize the software cycle only up tothe first delivery of a working version and neglect the whole afterlife ofchange and revision that follows.andM;Meyer says this is &quot;as remote to real life as those novels which stop whenthe hero marries the heroine--in reality, the time when the reallyinteresting part begis.&quot;andM;Easy extensibility and reusability of code would do more than make a bigdifference for teh maintenance and application backlog.andP;  Easily modified andreusable code could have the DP equivalent that low-cost fusion technologywould provide in the energy field.andM;It could propel us into a brand-new era of computing.andM;The principle of reusable parts revolutionized the manufacturing industry.andM;The concept of widespread interchangeable code or reusable program modulescould cause equally dramatic changes in the software industry.andP;  Reusable codecould offer an enterprise a tremendous strategic advantage over a competitor.andM;That is one of the main reasons why it is worthwhile to keep an eye on theobject-oriented approach.andM;Another quality of object orientation--the ability to handle complex datatypes--is another important capability.andM;&quot;CAD/CAM applications,&quot; says Tim Shetler, product marketing manager fordatabase engines at Informix Software Inc., Menlo Park, Calif., &quot;with theircomplex data requirements and engineering drawings are natural candidates forthis technology.&quot;andM;Lisa Thorell, a former industry analyst of Dataquest, notes that thecomputer-aided design (CAD) community has placed a lot of ads in the helpwanted pages of the San Jose Mercury News for C + + programmers.andP;  C + + is anincreasingly popular object-oriented programming language.andM;Throughout the entire manufacturing industry, CAD specialists--who have notbeen heavy users of hierarchical or relational databases--are expressing alot of interest in the newer object-oriented databases.andP;  If offers themcapabilities that hierarchical and relational systems could not provide.andO;Object-oriented database systems can handle the large volumes of complex datastructures that design engineers deal with.andM;&quot;In CAD environments,&quot; says Jeffrey Sutherland, vice president of engineeringat Graphael, Inc., Waltham, Mass., &quot;a system is made up of a lot of parts andthe parts have interrelationships.&quot;andM;For example, if you change the diameter of a bolt, the stress on the plate towhich the bolt is attached will also change.andP;  If that happens to be on thebottom of an airplane and the plate changes shape, the fuselage changesshape.andP;  If the fuselage changes shape, the wing changes shape.andP;  That all hasto change automatically when you modify the diameter of a bolt.andM;&quot;Now the object-oriented environment is a message passing environment,&quot;explains Sutherland.andP;  &quot;When you change that bolt, it can automaticallytrigger a message to the plate to change the size of the plate, etc.andP;  And youget this cascading message effect.&quot;andM;Other industries paying attention to object-oriented concepts includepublishing, communications, defense and financial services.andM;Computer-aided software engineering (Case) vendors are taking notice too.andO;Index Technology, Cambridge, Mass., is developing a new release ofExcelerator based on object-oriented concepts.andP;  It is due to be released bythe end of this year.andM;&quot;In early May,&quot; says Mark Fourman, director of product marketing forOntologic, Inc., Billerica, Mass., &quot;we signed a contract with IndexTechnology for them to build the next generation of their Case product on ourobject-oriented technology.andM;CASE COMMITMENTandM;&quot;That is pretty crucial for the object-oriented market.andP;  A lot of people areexperimenting and doing prototyping with object-oriented systems, but hereyou have a major Case vendor that is making a very big commitment to thistechnology.andM;&quot;It's very important to Ontologic as well,&quot;  Said Fourman.andP;  &quot;Index Technologydid their homework.andP;  They researched their object-oriented alternatives andthey selected us.&quot;andM;In fact, many of the application software vendors are taking very seriousnotice of object-oriented technology.andP;  If software reusability and some ofthe other techniques are exploited by their competitors, it becomes a matterof survival for software vendors to keep pace.andM;The object-oriented approach started with object-oriented programming (OOP)as demonstrated in the popular Machintosh user interfaces.andP;  (See sidebar onobject-oriented programming.)andM;The object-oriented approach now consists of object-oriented databasemanagement systems (OODBMS), and the beginnings of object-oriented analysisand object-oriented approaches and methodologies.andM;Several companies vie in the general-purpose OODBMS market.andP;  The leadingproducts are Gemstone from Servio Logic Development Corp., Beaverton, Ore.;andO;Vbase from Ontologic and G-Base from Graphael.andM;Informix plans to incorporate object-oriented technology into the nextrelease of their database engine, Informix-Turbo.andP;  Innovative SystemsTechniques (Insyte) of Newton, Mass., recently introduced Vision, ageneral-purpose OODBMS that is, so far, primarily targeted at decision-makingand the financial industry.andM;Other object-oriented databases are in various stages of development.andP;  Probe,initially created by Computer Corporation of America, Cambridge, Mass., isnow being developed by Xerox.andP;  And L.A.andP;  Rowe and a team of graduate studentsat the University of California at Berkeley are developing Post-Ingres.andP;  Likesome other object-oriented systems, Post-Ingres has a strong flavor ofartificial intelligence technology.andM;Founded in 1976, Graphael is a software development company specializing inartificial intelligence systems.andP;  In addition to G-Base, which is written inLisp, Graphael also markets G-Logis, an object-oriented Prolog languagewritten in Lisp.andM;&quot;G-base is built on the property-driven model which allows you to think ofthe database in accordance with the Ansi standard view of the three-schemaarchitecture,&quot; says Jeffrey Sutherland.andP;  &quot;This is something that mostdatabase companies have yet to implement.andM;&quot;Because of the way that data model works,&quot; added Sutherland, &quot;we're able tostraightforwardly implement entity relationship models in the database.&quot;andM;Ontologic introduced its object-oriented database management system, Vbase,in 1988.andP;  It is based on the C language and is being used in scientific,engineering and technical applications.andM;&quot;We are coming out with our second-generation product this October which willsupport C++ environments,&quot; says Fourman on Ontologic.andP;  &quot;That is especiallyimportant since C++ has emerged as the de facto standard for productionobject-oriented applications.&quot;andM;Servio Logic introduced the Gemstone object-oriented database in 1987.andP;  Thecompany reports that its growth rate of orders has been doubling every threeto four months.andP;  The typical selling price is $ 15,000 to $30,000.andM;Gemstone functions in a distributed and heterogeneous computing environment,using a client/server software architecture.andM;The server software, which operates on the host, either a VAX or a Sun,includes a complete object-oriented programming language, Opal, for datadefinition and manipulation.andP;  Clients can reside either on the host VAX,another VAX, a host Sun, and IBM PC, or a Tektronix workstation and soon on aMacintosh II.andP;  Applications can be written in either C or Smalltalk and canrun on either the workstation or the host.andM;Mike Connell, general manager of Servio Logic says, &quot;This technology is veryuseful where the client has a combination of large amounts of data and verycomplex data.andM;&quot;Simple data can be handled adequately by relational databases,&quot; continuousConnell, &quot;but not complex data.andP;  Object-oriented databases are excellent athandling very complex data situations.&quot;andM;Connell explains that increases in the volume, variety and complexity of datahave created the need for a new system of data management.andM;A &quot;LIVING&quot; DATABASEandM;He compares the data cells in an object-oriented system with living cells.andO;The analogy helps explain the concept of encapsulation within an object andhow objects can participate within larger structures.andM;&quot;A living cell in nature consists of value, behavior and structure,&quot; saysConnell.andP;  &quot;Object-oriented technology is based upon living data.andP;  The objector data cells contains content, structure and behavior much as the livingcell.&quot;andM;The most primitive forms of life are the one-celled animals.andP;  More complexforms of life consist of combinations of living cells into more complexorgans, and combinations of organ systems into more complex organisms.andP;  Yetthe cell has a life of its own.andP;  Its cell membrane, cytoplasm and nucleusprovide for the cell's life requirements while it participates in sustainingthe life of the larger organism of which it is a part.andM;If one were to burst the cell membrane, one would be left with the samemolecules that made up the cell, but its structure and the behavior (itsresponse to external stimuli) would be lost.andP;  All that would be left would beits value.andM;Connell explains that data in traditional systems are content (value) withoutstructure or behavior.andM;The virtual capsule within which the data and methods (procedures) areencapsulated acts much like the cell membrane to preserve the integrity ofits contents and behavior while permitting it to take part in the larger,more complex &quot;organic&quot; system.andM;Object-oriented database management systems combine the fundamental conceptsof object-orientation with such database capabilities as persistency,transaction support, concurrency sharing, and recoverability.andM;As with most new technologies, object-oriented techniques bring us a newvocabulary and new concepts to learn.andP;  The concepts admittedly have a bit ofa learning curve, but then, not every programmer in the early 1970s considerthe then new hierarchical concepts a snap either.andM;Some of the basic concepts of object orientation include encapsulation,inheritance, reusability and extensibility.andM;Encapsulation refers to packaging data and procedures together in a singlestructure called an object.andP;  Inheritance permits objects of a lower class toautomatically benefit from capabilities of a higher clasS.andP;  Reusability ispossible because objects are self-contained and can serve as standardsoftware modules in various applications.andP;  Extensibility is accomplished dueto the ease with which objects (software modules) can be modified orspecialized.andM;Object-oriented techniques make it easy to build new systems fromoff-the-shelf modules.andM;Haven't a lot of programmers been aiming for the goals of extensibility andreuasability for a long time?andP;  What makes this approach more likely tosucceed with these goals?andM;INGREDIENTS FOR SUCCESSandM;Developers who are experienced with the technique point to the combination ofencapsulation (combining data and procedures or methods in objects) andinheritance (objects can inherit capabilities from other objects in the sameclass) as the significant milestones of this approach.andM;While object-oriented concepts share similarities to existing techniques,there are marked differences as well.andP;  One similarity is that an object isbasicaly an entity that exists uniquely within the problem domain.andM;Another similarity can be seen between basic hierarchical concepts andinheritance among objects.andP;  Objects that have characteristics in common arepart of the same class.andM;Objects of a higher level class can let a subclass inherit the basicattributes of that class.andP;  Subclasses within a class specify what is uniqueabout their own individual subclass.andP;  A specific entity is known as aninstance of that class.andM;So far, so good.andP;  A lot of that sounds pretty familiar.andM;However, the similarity stops there.andP;  An object is much more than thetraditional entity in the entity-relationship approach.andM;An object contains code as well as data.andM;An object specifies the structure of the data as well as a collection ofcoded procedures, known as methods, which can access that data directly.andP;  Anobject has the capability of acting upon itself or sending messages to otherobjects.andM;This is the most unique aspect of the object-oriented approach--that code, orbehavior, is attached to objects.andP;  Objects &quot;encapsulate&quot; both state andbehavior as well as value.andP;  This represents a major divergence fromconventional programming approaches.andM;Traditionally, data has been passive.andP;  It got created and then it just sat ina file or in a database until it was accessed and manipulated or deleted.andO;The action was done to the data by an application program.andP;  The data neverdid anything to itself.andM;Likewise, the data never did anything all by itself.andP;  It just hung arounduntil something happened to it.andM;It was always an application program that made something happen to data.andP;  Theprocedural steps contained in a program--a separate entity from thedata--caused action to be taken using that data.andM;Data takes a much more active role in an object-oriented system.andP;  Data nowhas procedures stored along with it.andP;  Data now knows how to do some thingsfor itself.andP;  For example, a file may know how to open or close itself.andP;  Adata field may know to insert slashes into its six digits before it allowsitself to be printed.andM;The behavior of data that is associated with an object falls into twoseparate categories--a private part and a public part.andM;The private part is available only to other internal members of that class.andM;&quot;An example of a private part of an object,&quot; says Tom Atwood, chairman ofObject Design in Burlington, Mass., &quot;would be the knowledge of how to storethe object.andP;  The object might contain the instructions to store itself as abit map.&quot;andM;The public part is available to any function inside or outside that class.andO;This structure is important to reusing the software.andP;  An application can bechanged by modifying the functions that act on the public part of a class,rather than by rewriting the application itself.andM;BANK ACCOUNT EXAMPLEandM;As an example of a class structure with inheritance, suppose we have anobject named Bank__account.andP;  The Bank__account object would define datastorage for the account balance of its instances as well as implementoperations such as &quot;deposit&quot; and &quot;withdraw.&quot;andM;All these definitions would be inherited by the Bank__account's subtypes,Checking__account and Savings__account.andP;  On the other hand, Savings__accountmight contain additional methods of its own, like &quot;calc__interest.&quot;andM;In conventional systems, though data and procedures interact, the twoconcepts are kept quite separate--data is stored in file structures or DBMSswhile instructions are stored in application programs.andP;  Objects, however, arediscrete entities containing both data and procedures.andM;Pendleton of NOAA, a user of Gemstone, says that combining data andprocedures enables the objects to have intelligence.andM;&quot;At NOAA, we make navigational charts for ships and planes,&quot; explainsPendleton.andP;  &quot;The chart is made up of many data types.andP;  Chart features includeobjects like bouys, submerged shipwrecks, rocks, overhead obstructions andmany other things.andP;  There are 200 to 300 different chart features.andM;&quot;Since they are stored as objects,&quot; says Pendleton, &quot;the features know--in anintelligent sense--how they are supposed to go on that chart.andP;  A chart getsbuilt up from the chart objects knowing what to do and where to go on thechart.andM;&quot;Now the final physical chart drawings, of course, are much smaller thanreality,&quot; continues Pendleton.andP;  &quot;At a particular spot on the chart, theremight be several occurrences of chart features.andP;  Suppose that right next to alarge rock, there are two shipwrecks--one has nitroglycerin stored in it, theother has a mast sticking up.andP;  At approximately the same spot, there is alsoa buoy.andM;&quot;The limited resource is space on the chart.andP;  How can all this be depicted?andM;&quot;In the object-oriented system, the objects have the intelligence to know togo and perform the necessary conflict resolution to portray the biggestthreats to a boat in the best way.andP;  One option, for example, is to rotate thedirection of the symbols on the chart so that more than one symbol can bedepicted at the same relative location.&quot;andM;Pendleton said that his early background had been in procedural-based Fortranprogramming.andP;  He said he was not sure about the object-oriented approach whenhe first became aware of it.andP;  But he is a strong advocate now.andM;LIKES GEMSTONE TOOLSandM;He also likes the tools that Gemstone provides.andP;  Gemstone has its ownobject-oriented programming language, Opal, for data definition and datamanipulation.andP;  However, users have a choice of using Smalltalk, or the OpalProgramming Environment, or a C application for building the user interface.andM;&quot;We're using Smalltalk for our user interface,&quot; says Pendleton.andP;  &quot;The systemlets us set up our objects in Smalltalk.andP;  It's almost deceptively simple.&quot;andM;In talking to Pendleton and others, it sounds as though working withSmalltalk is fun too.andP;  Their enthusiasm indicates that they are enjoyingtheir work.andM;In addition to handling large and complex data types, object-oriented systemscan model objects over time, giving a history of objects.andM;Richard Newman, marketing manager of Innovative Systems Techniques' Vision,which is gaining popularity in the financial community, says, &quot;This isimportant not only for investment analysis, but for other markets as well,where you need to keep history and versions of information.&quot;andM;&quot;What we try to stress,&quot; says Newman, &quot;is that the best way to sellobject-oriented database management is to show people where it really can beused rather than just telling people it's the next greatest technology.andP;  Wehave some very conservative customers who are using this technology.andP;  Theonly reason they are using it is because it solves their problem.andM;&quot;We're not selling OODBMS on the basis that it's 'space age stuff.'andP;  We'reselling it to solve today's problems,&quot; says Newman.andM;Most of Insyte's current financial customers have their production systems ona combination of IMS and DB/2.andP;  Insyte's Vision OODBMS adds functionality tothe systems they already have.andM;&quot;For example, at T. Rowe Price, all of their portfolio accounting data isstored in IMS files.andP;  We don't have a direct link right now between thesesystems.andP;  They do a nightly feed from IMS into Vision.andP;  So we look at Visionas a complement to their production systems.andM;&quot;We're not telling people to take all those accounting systems they'vewritten in relational systems or in IMS and rewrite them in Vision.andP;  We'resaying, 'Let's complement those systems and add extra functionality.'&quot;andM;WORTH THE INVESTMENTandM;Newman says the extra functionality that has been added is worth theinvestment because end users can now build their own complex applications.andM;Even with DB/2, while end users could begin to do their own queries, theystill had to go to the DP department for complex applications.andP;  With Vision,the end users can build their own applications using a Smalltalk type ofenvironment, he said.andM;&quot;End users are very comfortable with the Smalltalk-like environment,&quot; saysNewman.andP;  &quot;Now when a portfolio manager yells at one of his researchassistants, 'I want a new report and I want it yesterday!' they might not getit 'yesterday,' but they'll get it a lot faster than they used to.&quot;andM;Many others also see object-oriented techniques as a complement to relationalsystems.andM;&quot;We don't see object-oriented systems replacing systems where relationalsystems perform well,&quot; says Fourman of Ontologic.andP;  &quot;For a heavy volume ofhigh-speed banking transactions acting against simple data structures,relational systems work well.andP;  However, for complex financial modeling,object-oriented systems offer far more benefit.&quot;andM;Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, a newsletter based in New York City,agrees that it is not a situation of object-oriented systems replacing orcompeting with relational systems.andM;She says object-oriented systems offer capabilities that relational systemscannot offer.andP;  Many analysts see that in the long run, each technology willhave its place.andM;Tim Shetler, product marketing manager for database engines at Informix,Menlo Park, Calif., says, &quot;When you get into complex and very large dataobjects, the typical relational database system can't handle them.andO;Additional capabilities are needed.&quot;andM;Informix is extending its SQL-based DBMS product line, adding the support ofBinary Large Objects (Blobs).andP;  This will enable users to store any type offile, such as a spreadsheet, facsimile, digitized image or word processingdocument in a database.andM;To retrieve these new information types stored in the database, Informix willextend SQL with free-text search technology.andM;IBM is adding object-oriented capabilities to its midrange and personalcomputer software.andP;  However, a spokesman for IBM said that any mainframedatabase work with object-oriented systems is in the research stages and isstill considered proprietary information.andM;Cullinet Software, Inc., Westwood, Mass., is also reported to be addingobject-oriented features to its current database products.andM;BEST WAY TO STARTandM;What is the best way to get started with this technology?andM;Probably the most important step is to become thoroughly educated about theessence of this approach and to realistically analyze the long-termpossibilities for your specific type of business.andM;If you are manager and decide to assign a highly qualified technician toperform the analysis, do not be surprised if the initial reaction isnegative.andM;A lot of brilliant technicians are loyal to what they know and love.andP;  Youmight have to let them play with Smalltalk before they gain a realunderstanding of the power of the object-oriented approach.andP;  You might haveto assign several techniques to perform individual evaluations.andM;A programming manager in the manufacturing industry reports that an excellentPC and workstation programmer, proficient in C and Pascal, had completedisdain for the object-oriented approach initially.andM;IBM's announcement that object-oriented capabilities would be incorporatedinto its OS/2 Presentation Manager was met with a shrug.andP;  C++, with itsobject-oriented extensions to C, was regarded with a concerned shrug.andM;Until Borland International of Scotts Valley, Calif., joined the game, peoplewhere still disinterested in objected-oriented programming.andP;  But afterBorland announced an object-oriented version of Turbo Pascal, many started toget seriously interested.andM;Different application developers have varying opinions about the ease ordifficulty of learning to program in an object-oriented frame of mind.andM;However, there is one common insight.andP;  It is easier for a new programmer toaccept the concepts of an object-oriented approach than it is for someone whois used to thinking of data as totally separate from procedures.andM;Carl Longnecker, a partner with the consulting offices of Arthur Andersen andamp;Co., Chicago, says that the object-oriented approach represents a &quot;radicaldeparture&quot; from conventional programming.andP;  It provides a different way ofconstructing the relationship between data and programming.andM;Some analysts have referred to the object-oriented approach as &quot;a newattitude.&quot;andM;Despite the learning curve of this new technique, Servio Logic expects thatover half of the software systems developed in the year 2000 will useobject-oriented technology.andM;&quot;We're going through a classical technology adaptation,&quot; says Connell ofServio Logic.andP;  &quot;The market for OODBMS today resembles the PC market in1975--not yet a household word, but poised for near-term growth.&quot;andM;OBJECT MARKET IS YOUNGandM;Analysis of the product life cycles of DBMS, RDBMS and OODBMS shows that eachtechnology is in a different stage.andP;  DBMS is in the maturity phase RDBMS isin the growth phase, and OODBMS is in the development phase.andP;  Servio Logicbelieves the 1989 market for OODBMS alone will be at least $15 million.andM;Thorell, formerly of Dataquest, believes the 1989 figure for allobject-oriented products combined will be $35 million.andP;  By 1992, she feelsthis could be anywhere from $64 million to $150 million.andM;&quot;The market is difficult to gauge right now,&quot; Thorell said.andP;  She added thatthe object-oriented market &quot;will not take off until there is a certainsynergy of tools.&quot;andM;According to Fourman of Ontologic, &quot;As the front-end tools become available,we will see more use of object-oriented technology by end users.&quot;andM;Right now, objects are mostly created by writting C++ code.andP;  Eventually,there will be tools that permit you to create objects using graphics.andP;  Atthat time, end users with comple data needs will be able to create their ownobjects and related systems.&quot;andM;Industry analysts predict that in the next few years, we will see theintroduction of new object-oriented tools as well as additionalobject-oriented DBMSs.andM;Work is proceeding on methodologies as well as tools.andP;  Various schools ofthought, seminars and many scholarly papers are appearing on object-orientedanalysis and object-oriented design.andM;RISING INTEREST LEVELandM;Some theorize that there is no conflict with structured analysis and designtechniques, while others say that structured techniques fall short of themark for object-oriented systems.andM;In fact, the efforts to define object-oriented analysis and design techniqueshave accelerated within just the last few months--indicating the rapidlyrising interest level and the growing need for answers and guidelines.andM;Newsman of Innovative Systems Techniques, recently spoke at a meetingattended by various object-oriented vendors.andP;  Many of them were talking aboutthe future impact of their object-oriented technology.andM;&quot;You know, you're all talking about 1995,&quot; said Newman when it was his turnto speak.andP;  &quot;But I know this technology is needed now.andP;  I know it because wehave a lot of customers right now.&quot;andM;He is right.andP;  There are a lot of customers for object-oriented technologyalready.andP;  And there will be a lot more in coming years.andM;Bochenski is a high-tech freelance writer and DP profesional who lives inEssington, Pa.andP;  She has over 28 years experience in data processing,performing a wide range of consulting and data processing services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
