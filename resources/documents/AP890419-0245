The Senate voted 61-38 to block an amendment offered by Sen. BobGraham, D-Fla., that would require President Bush to renominate M.Danny Wall as chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and theSenate to vote on the appointment.   The administration wants to guarantee Wall the right to serveout his term through June 1991.   However, Graham complained that Wall's reassuring comments aboutthe health of Sandamp;Ls, as late as a month before last November'spresidential election, ``amounted to ``an intravenous shot ofmorphine that would have numbed anyone to the crisis.''   Sen. Jake Garn, R-Utah, offered a warm personal defense of Wall,who worked for him for 17 years, dating back to Garn's days asmayor of Salt Lake City.   He praised Wall's honesty and integrity, adding, ``Let's do anFBI report on this man. It'll be so dull, so boring that nobodywould want to read it.''   Meanwhile, Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, an opponent of thepackage, threatened to prolong debate unless the Senate adopts ahalf-dozen amendments, including several pro-consumer measures.   ``If you're going to cost the consumers of this country ... theleast you can do is make them feel good about it and give them alittle something,'' he said.   The chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Donald W.Riegle Jr., D-Mich., and Garn, the panel's senior Republican, haveso far defeated attempts to amend the bill in the full Senate. All21 members of the committee have endorsed the bill.   The legislation basically tracks the proposal presented inFebruary by Bush, pledging $157 billion to the problem over thenext 10 years and providing a host of reforms, chief among them arequirement that Sandamp;L owners back their lending with more of theirown capital.   On a 50-48 vote _ 12 short of the 60-vote majority required _the Senate on Tuesday rejected an effort by Graham to add $50billion of the plan's cost to the fiscal 1989 budget. That movecould have stuck Bush with the biggest federal deficit in history.   Earlier, senators voted 66-32 to beat an amendment that wouldhave weakened the administration's control over disposal of anestimated $400 billion in real estate owned by failed Sandamp;Ls.   Objections by Metzenbaum threatened to spoil Senate leaders'plans to pass the bill today and leave for an 11-day recess.   Metzenbaum has not specified what he wants. However, he saidpossibilities include requiring banks and Sandamp;Ls to offer cheapchecking accounts for poor people and free cashing of governmentchecks.   He also wants financial institutions to disclose theirperformance in serving minorities and he wants the government toreopen last year's Sandamp;L rescues.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he wouldrecess the Senate on Thursday to observe the first day of Passover,then, if Metzenbaum desired, return on Friday and keep senatorsworking into the weekend.   However, Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said supporters of the billwould file a motion today seeking to force a vote on final passageby Friday.   The House version of Sandamp;L legislation passed a Bankingsubcommittee this week. It is scheduled for consideration by thefull committee next week and by the full House by the end of May.Following a House-Senate conference, that could put the bill onBush's desk in June, four months after he announced his plan.   On the funding mechanism, six Democratic senators joined 44Republicans in support of the administration plan, which wasopposed by 47 Democrats and one Republican.   Graham had argued that financing the Sandamp;L bailout through regularTreasury borrowings would be $4.5 billion cheaper than theadministration's plan to borrow the money through a quasi-publicagency and keep $50 billion out of the budget deficit.   However, Graham's plan could have ballooned the 1989 budgetdeficit within range of the all-time high of $221 billion, set in1986.   An amendment by Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., would have loosenedadministration control of the Sandamp;L bailout agency. Bush wanted theTreasury secretary, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and theattorney general to run the agency. The Senate bill adds twooutside members to the board, but Kerrey would have added fouroutside members, enough to outvote the government officials.   Democrats opposing Graham on the funding plan were Sens. JosephBiden of Delaware, Alan Cranston of California, Alan Dixon ofIllinois, Joe Lieberman of Connecticut, Jay Rockefeller of WestVirginia and Jim Sasser of Tennessee. Only one Republican, LarryPressler of South Dakota, supported Graham. Sens. Bill Bradley,D-N.J., and Albert Gore, D-Tenn., did not vote.</TEXT></DOC>
