Thelatest year includes about $3.2 million paid out under ITT'slong-term performance plans. The company also reimbursed Mr.Araskog $69,741 to cover interest on a loan he took out in1980 to buy an apartment at ITT's request. ITT paid Mr.Araskog an additional $102,000 to cover the cost of personaltax and financial advisers and for transportation. Thecompany contributed $42,182 for the executive to thecompany's investment and savings plan.   ITT said &quot;Mr. Araskog's compensation . . . is at a levelwhich is no more than a fair reward for bringing to ITT thebenefits which have come to the corporation under hisstewardship.&quot; Mr. Araskog, who is a director of Dow Jones andamp;Co., has been ITT's top officer since 1980. Dow Jonespublishes The Wall Street Journal.   ITT has interests in financial services, insurance andhotels, among others.   The spokesman conceded that per-share earnings haddeclined several years during Mr. Araskog's tenure. But headded that those drops occurred during years when theexecutive was restructuring the business. &quot;Now the company isfixed and in a very strong position,&quot; the spokesman said. Inthe past three years, per-share earnings have posted annualincreases, he added.   In 1990, ITT had net income of $958 million, or $7.28 ashare, on revenue of $20.6 billion.   In December, the $55 billion California Public EmployeesRetirement System, known as Calpers, singled out ITT and W.R.Grace andamp; Co. for boosting the pay of their chairmen whencompany earnings were flat or declining. The fund alsoproposed bylaw changes at those companies intended to linkexecutive compensation with earnings.   On Friday, an ITT spokesman said the company had adoptedCalpers's bylaws language that called for outside directorsto serve on the board's compensation committee. But the moveonly reaffirmed existing policy, he said, adding that ITT'scompensation committee has long been made up of outsidedirectors.</TEXT></DOC>
