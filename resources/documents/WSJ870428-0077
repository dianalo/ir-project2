In a lawsuit filed in federal court here, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., which is now the receiver for the failed thrift, said former Vernon officers &quot;looted, dissipated and wasted&quot; Vernon's assets. The suit accuses seven former Vernon officials and Vernon's parent company of fraudulently inflating the thrift's net worth, ignoring regulatory enforcement orders by making high-risk loans, executing sham lending transactions and bilking Vernon of millions of dollars to pay huge bonuses and for lavish perquisites.    Those perks included a fleet of private aircraft -- including two jets -- three beach houses, a hunt club, yacht and luxury cars, including a Rolls Royce. In the four years or so that Vernon was managed by the defendants, the FSLIC says, Vernon deteriorated to an institution with $350 million in negative net worth and about $1.7 billion in assets, after a history as a small but profitable institution in Vernon, a small town in north Texas.    The civil suit accuses Don R. Dixon, a Dallas real estate financier who indirectly controlled Vernon and was on its lending committee, and six Vernon officials of fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, violations of state and federal banking laws and conversion of Vernon funds for personal use. The suit seeks damages totaling at least $540 million. The Justice Department is conducting a criminal investigation, according to law-enforcement officials.    Vernon Savings' problems have been part of the debate in Congress concerning the recapitalization of the insolvent FSLIC insurance fund. Several officers of Texas thrifts have been trying to reduce the amount of funding proposed for the FSLIC because they fear that it will result in the closing of many Texas thrifts that have been hit hard by bad loan decisions and a recession in the Southwest.    House Speaker Jim Wright has been pushing for a more modest FSLIC recapitalization. And last December, Mr. Wright called Edwin J. Gray, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, to get Mr. Gray to delay possible regulatory action against Vernon because Mr. Dixon told Mr. Wright he had a buyer for Vernon.    A sale of Vernon didn't take place. Meanwhile, federal and state examinations of Vernon disclose that 96% of its loans are in default -- data that the FSLIC alleges Vernon officers had fraudulently concealed. Mr. Wright's aide says the speaker didn't have any knowledge of Vernon's troubles but was seeking to avoid a government bailout of the thrift. Vernon was closed March 20.    The FSLIC also seeks a temporary restraining order from the federal court that would effectively freeze all the assets of the former Vernon executives and Vernon's holding company. U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer plans to meet early today with attorneys to discuss such an order.    Besides Mr. Dixon, the suit names as defendants Woody F. Lemons, a former Vernon chairman and chief executive officer; Richard A. Little, a former executive vice president; John V. Hill, a former chief lending officer; John G. Smith, a former senior vice president; Patrick G. King, a former president and chief operating officer; and Pat L. Malone, a former president of Vernon's Dallas division. Dondi Financial Corp., Dallas, was the parent company of Vernon after Mr. Dixon bought most of the thrift's stock in 1982. Mr. Dixon also controlled a majority stake in Dondi, according to the FSLIC lawsuit.    Mr. Dixon's attorney didn't return phone calls and Messrs. Dixon, Lemons, Little, Hill, Smith and King couldn't be reached. Mr. Malone said he is &quot;flabbergasted&quot; at the lawsuit. &quot;I don't know how to respond,&quot; he said.    The FSLIC said the lawsuit represents the most damages it has ever sought from a defunct thrift. And federal thrift regulators say that more lawsuits of this kind are likely to follow. Vernon may be the most dramatic example of alleged abuse, but thrift regulators say the practices are widespread, especially in the Southwest.    The lawsuit specifically accuses Vernon officers of inflating its net worth in order to pay a total of nearly $23 million in dividends, most of which went to Mr. Dixon's company and about $4 million to Mr. Dixon. The unrealistic financial performance of the thrift allowed it to pay some $15 million in bonuses to senior Vernon executives, including $4.4 million to Mr. Dixon.    The suit also contends that funds generated by the thrift went to pay for personal expenses of some of its top officers, including a $2 million beach house in Del Mar, Calif., that Mr. Dixon used as a personal residence for a time, a wedding party for Mr. Dixon, and trips to Europe for the Dixons and another Vernon official and his wife.    Among other things, the FSLIC suit says that Vernon frequently made loans without proper documentation, usually for the full amount plus interest without recourse to the borrower. And when the borrower defaulted on the loan, Vernon put up funds to make some interest payments. This made the loans look current, when in fact they were in default. Throughout most of Mr. Dixon's ownership of Vernon, the thrift had little or no reserve for possible loan losses until federal regulators forced one a few months ago, which led to the thrift's collapse. </TEXT></DOC>
