Leonardt Kreisle said the ``synergistic reactor,'' developed byAerological Research Systems with help from UT engineering students,removes virtually all sulfur dioxide from smokestack emissions.   ``Dry-air scrubbers'' now in use are more expensive to make anduse and remove only 60 percent to 70 percent of the chemical, hesaid.   Thomas Ewan, president of Aerological Research in Daingerfield,said the company has a prototype that can remove 10 pounds a minuteof sulfur dioxide _ too little for a power plant _ but plans tobuild one big enough to remove 5,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide aminute for power plants and factories.   Sulfur dioxide is a byproduct of steel manufacturing, refiningand coal burning. It combines with nitrous oxide, sunlight and rainto form acid. The government has said that a solution to the acidproblem will cost billions of dollars.   The patent application for the device was accepted by thegovernment in November. Ewan said the company is negotiating withmanufacturers to produce the devices for the market next year.   ``We've not looked at the price yet,'' he said, ``but it willcost a lot less than conventional scrubbers. The design is quitesimple even though the operation is sophisticated.''   Kreisle said he is not a participant in the patent and has nofinancial stake in the device.   He said it is a fraction of the size of comparable dry-airscrubbers, operates on about a third of the energy, acts morequickly, and leaves only dry gypsum, or chalk, as a byproduct.   The reactor is housed in a steel tube 24 feet long and 6 inchesin diameter and is designed to replace the uppermost part of asmokestack.   Gases formed by burning of coal and other organic materials entera reactor chamber filled with steam and ground lime. A resultingchemical action removes the sulfur dioxide, according to thedevelopers.</TEXT></DOC>
