Referring to his 23 years of service in regulating commercialnuclear power, Victor Stello Jr. said, ``Nuclear power is aninherently controversial subject and all decisions are subject tocriticism from one source or another.''   At the start of his confirmation hearing, which is expected tolast at least three days, Stello told the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee his opponents also were motivated by a dislike of hismanagement style.   ``I say what I think ... I'm aggressive, I'm not a diplomat ...I can be abrasive,'' Stello said.   The hearing opened on a note of confusion, with Sen. Sam Nunn,D-Ga., the panel chairman, announcing that the White House and theJustice Department had not yet provided letters, reports and othermaterials on Stello requested several weeks ago.   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, questioned whether the hearing shouldgo ahead since the missing materials might be important to membersquestioning Stello's credentials.   Glenn raised a series of questions about Stello's suitabilityfor the job, and Democratic Sens. Timothy Wirth of Colorado andEdward Kennedy of Massachusetts said in opening statements thatthey would vote against Stello's nomination.   Glenn and Sens. Carl Levin of Michigan, Albert Gore of Tennesseeand Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico also are expected to oppose Stello.Republican members John Warner of Virginia, Strom Thurmond of SouthCarolina and Trent Lott of Mississippi told Stello they wouldsupport his nomination.   The committee has 20 members.   In an unusual move, Energy Secretary James D. Watkins personallyintroduced Stello to the committee and pleaded for his confirmationto a post he called ``one of the toughest'' in the federalgovernment.   Watkins called Stello ``the right person for this job, anindividual whose tough yet reasoned style meets my requirements.''   To bolster his chances for committee approval, Stello this weeksent panel members a massive volume of his rebuttals to chargesthat he is unqualified for the job and ill-suited to restore publictrust in the safety of operations at the weapons complex, whichincludes 17 major defense facilities in 12 states.   Stello's report was not made public.   Even if the committee voted to recommend confirmation, itappeared highly unlikely the full Senate would vote on thenomination before its holiday recess next week.   In a move interpreted by some as a sign that Watkins doubtedStello's chances of winning Senate confirmation, Watkins late lastmonth told a top aide to take charge of the weapons office pendingthe outcome of the Stello debate.   Representatives of the environmental group Greenpeace U.S.A.,which has led a national campaign against Stello's nomination, saidTuesday they were disappointed the committee did not accept thegroup's request to testify at today's hearing.   ``If ever a nominee called for a thorough review process this isit,'' said Stephen Schwartz of Greenpeace.   On Monday, Wirth joined four other senators not on the committeein urging President Bush to withdraw the nomination, which Watkinshad predicted would be controversial before it was announced inJuly.   The letter said the poor condition of the weapons facilities,coupled with declining public trust in the Energy Department'sability to safely operate the plants, made it imperative that thecredentials of the weapons production chief be unassailable.   ``Even if confirmed, the controversy surrounding Mr. Stellowould critically impair his ability to address the managementfailures of past administrations which have reduced our nuclearweapons production program to a shambles,'' the letter said.   The five senators cited a record by Stello of ``circumventinghealth and safety regulations and obstructing investigations''while serving at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.   The letter was signed by Wirth and Democratic Sens. RichardBryan of Nevada, Howard Metzenbaum of Ohio, Brock Adams ofWashington and Alan Cranston of California.   The controversy surrounding Stello comes from his more than 20years of work at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which regulatescommercial nuclear power, and the Atomic Energy Commission, thepredecessor of both the NRC and the Energy Department.   The most recent incident, which sparked a congressionalinvestigation of Stello's conduct in 1987, involved unorthodoxprocedures he used as NRC chief of staff in approving cash paymentsto obtain information from a former utility employee.</TEXT></DOC>
