Leaders in the fashion industry say many stores have stoppedselling and many customers stopped buying jewelry made of ivory.One trade paper says women soon may be wearing jewelry made of cowbones, instead.   ``I talk to jewelers every day, from Main Street to FifthAvenue, and they all express abhorrence at selling ivory today,''says David Federman, gemstone writer for Modern Jeweler magazine.``If they're doing it, they're selling it under the counter.''   So thoroughly has the ivory boycott caught on that some see init the seeds of an environmental ethic in high fashion.   ``There seems to be a very strong trend among Americans to thinkfirst of wildlife, of compassion, and not our own vanity,'' saysReenie Brown, publisher of the trade magazine Accessories. ``It'sbecoming unfashionable to wear furs, too,'' she says.   Ms. Brown has banned ivory from a trade show she runs and fromthe pages of her magazines. ``I've lost some ads,'' she says.   Environmentalists say the ivory story is comparable to whathappened a decade ago when people became aware of the threat thatthe spotted cats _ jaguars, cheetahs and leopards _ could becomeextinct.   Coats made of those furs virtually disappeared from the marketunder the pressure of an outcry for endangered species.   ``Ivory Industry Faces Extinction,'' Colored Stone, anothertrade journal, says in its current issue.   ``Many dealers are switching to ivory substitutes,'' thepublication says. ``Treated cow bone seems to be the currentfavorite.''   Environmentalist Brian Day of the World Wildlife Fund says theprice of ivory at places that still sell it has dropped by 50percent, as dealers seek to unload their stocks.   Steinway andamp; Sons wrote this summer to 800 ``Steinway artists'' _ranging from Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn to Billy Taylor andPeter Nero _ that the company would stop producing ivory-keyedpianos for concert tours and switch to plastic. It made that switchyears ago for ordinary pianos.   ``Without exception, all were appreciative of the environmentalconcern,'' said spokesman Leo Spellman.   The ivory boycott took off this summer after President Bushsigned an order prohibiting the import of African ivory. Canada,Western Europe and Japan followed suit.   The United States had accounted for 12 percent of world ivoryimports. Japan and Hong Kong were the heaviest importers.   Bush's action set the stage for the vote this week by aninternational conference to classify the elephant as an endangeredspecies and ban all trade in elephant products.   Five African nations balked, saying they would continue sellingtusks, but the ban is still likely to undercut the market forelephant poachers who hunt with automatic rifles.   About 70,000 elephants are killed each year, according toWilliam Conway, general director of the New York ZoologicalSociety. He said the African elephant population has fallen from1.5 million 10 years ago to 625,000.   Last week, major retailers pledged not to sell ivory and andclothing designers said they would not use it in a campaignorganized by designer Liz Claiborne.   Taking the pledge were such stores as Macy's, Lord andamp; Taylor,Nordstrom, Marshall Field's and the Federated, Allied and CarterHawley Hale chains and designers Oscar de la Renta, Dana Buchman,Linda Allard and Bill Blass.   ``We believe that ivory must be kept out of fashion and in thepossession of the magnificent creatures for whom it was originallydesigned,'' those firms said. ``Why should a baby elephant beorphaned for a few bangles and beads?''</TEXT></DOC>
