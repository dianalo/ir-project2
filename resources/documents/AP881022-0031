Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., told the Senate itwas ``almost a tragedy'' to allow a handful of House members tobottle up the sanctions bill in the last hours of the 100thCongress.   ``The will of the majority, the will of the Congress has beenrepudiated,'' he said.   The Senate had initially passed a strong set of sanctionsagainst Iraq in the wake of reports that the Iraqi army hadsubjected Kurdish villages to gas attacks. It later went along witha watered-down compromise version originating in the House.   But that compromise died when it was stripped from a pending taxbill.   ``Unfortunately, special interests got into the act,'' Pell toldthe Senate.   He said opposition to sanctions against Iraq had developed inthe American agriculture, oil and chemical industries.   ``The net effect has been to kill the Iraq sanctions for thisCongress,'' said Pell, who vowed to revisit the issue early in the101st Congress next year.   He said that for now he is concerned that Iraq will get ``thewrong message'' and that the Kurds may be placed in further peril.</TEXT></DOC>
