At the United Nations, Francois Giuliani, spokesman forSecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, said Friday that a U.N.team of experts will travel to Iran to see victims of what Tehranclaims was an Iraqi attack with chemical weapons.   Each side claimed to have shot down four of the other'swarplanes during the battle on the northern front.   Iran said its Revolutionary Guards killed or wounded 500 Iraqisin heavy fighting east of Sayyid Sadiq. Both sides used warplanesand helicopter gunships in the battle.   In the Persian Gulf, Iraq claimed its warplanes scored``accurate and effective hits'' on two tankers off Iran during thenight. There was no immediate confirmation from maritime executives.   Reports from Tehran said the Iranians hit Basra, Iraq's southernprovincial capital, and five other border cities farther north withmissile and artillery barrages. Iraq said its warplanes bombedBakhtaran, Hamadan and Shushtar in western Iran.   Iraq reported 10 civilians killed and 22 wounded. Iran said 53people were killed in the Iraqi raids.   Towns and cities on both sides of the frontier have beenbattered regularly since the war began in September 1980.   Both sides have fired more than 250 missiles into each otherscapitals and other cities cities since Feb. 29, killing hundreds ofcivilians.   Foreign ministers of the Organization of Islamic Conference inAmman, Jordan, said they would press the United Nations to force acease-fire on Iran. The Iranians left the meeting Thursday,accusing the delegates of serving only Iraq's interest.   In New York, Iran's U.N. ambassador, Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati,said Iraq used chemical weapons on Kurdish rebels, in violation ofinternational agreements. Giuliani said the U.N. delegation wasmaking the visit at Iran's request.   Mahallati also said Tehran would send a special emissary forpeace talks at the United Nations. Perez de Cuellar had requestedthe consultations on efforts to implement a cease-fire resolutionpassed by the Security Council last year.   Dispatches of Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency saidRevolutionary Guards pushing into northeastern Iraq mauled fourinfantry battalions and a brigade, totaling around 7,500 men.   IRNA identified the brigade as part of Iraq's 7th Army Corps, anelement in the defense network that protects Basra from periodicIranian thrusts across the southern border.   That indicated the Iraqis had moved forces from the south, whereabout half their 1 million soldiers are concentrated, to counterthe northern offensive.   According to the agency, fighting centered on the Rishanmountains east of Sayyid Sadiq, the apparent Iranian objective inthe latest phase of the 10-day-old assault.   An Iranian force of at least 30,000 men was said to be fivemiles west of the town, an important transportation hub, onThursday after a two-pronged drive 10 miles across the border thatcut off many Iraqi soldiers.   Tehran radio said four Iraqi fighter-bombers were shot down byground fire Friday and the pilots killed. Baghdad's official IraqiNews Agency said anti-aircraft fire downed four Iranian jets in thebattle zone and Iraqi fighters destroyed four helicopters.   Iran claims its soldiers have killed or wounded 11,000 Iraqisduring the northern offensive, captured 4,500 and destroyed 200tanks and armored vehicles. Iraq says thousands of invaders havebeen killed, but admits losing several towns.   By Iranian accounts, Revolutionary Guards reached a position 5miles east of Sayyid Sadiq after overrunning several other townssince the offensive began March 16.   They are said to control the area around the eastern shore ofLake Darbandikhan and hills overlooking a major hydroelectric dam,on the southern edge of the lake, that provides power for much ofnortheast Iraq.   Western military analysts said the Iranians could use thecaptured territory as the base for a drive southward, behind Iraqidefense lines in the central sector of the 730-mile border just 80miles east of Baghdad.   That could threaten the Kirkuk oilfields, 80 miles west ofSayyid Sadiq. They are heavily defended and produce about 1.5million barrels of crude a day, more than half Iraq's totalproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
