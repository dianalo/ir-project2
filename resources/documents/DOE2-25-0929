It istaken into account that grain boundary area is retained under such transformations.Theoretical expressions for transition temperature dependence on thedegree of the matter dispersion are found. It is shown that in high-dispersionsamples under dispersivity growth the transformation temperature shoulddecrease and transformation interval should expand. Experiments on indirect(based on electric resistance measuring) and direct electron microscopeobservation of martensitic transformation in high-dispersion TiNi aredescribed. Experimental results agree with the theory conclusions. 4refs.; 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
