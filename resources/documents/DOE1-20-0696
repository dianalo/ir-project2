The yield of extracts as a function oftemperature is discussed. The donor property and shuttling effect ofthe pyridine extract is also considered. The effect of molecular structure,the amount of solvent soluble material and the presence of small moleculeswhich contribute to fluidity during heating, are discussed. 7 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
