Proposed change PCN-256 would revise Technical Specifications3/4.3/1, ``Reactor Protective Instrumentation,'' ands 3/4.3.2, ``EngineeredSafety Features Actuation System Instrumentation.'' Proposed change PCN-281would revise Technical Specification 3/4.3.3.3, ``Seismic Instrumentation.''<T3>The Need for the Proposed Action: </T3>The proposed amendments arerequired to prevent unnecessary plant shutdowns to perform surveillancetests which cannot be performed during plant operation.<T3>Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action: </T3>For each of theproposed amendments, the licensees provided analyses to demonstrate thereliability of the systems. The staff reviewed the licensees' analysesand agrees that there would be little or no chance of failure during anadditional testing interval of 1.5 months beyond the maximum interval of22.5 months currently allowed by the Technical Specifications. Therefore,the staff has approved the proposed 24 month surveillance interval forthese proposed changes but has not allowed a 25% extension of the intervalas is normally permitted by Specification 4.0.2.As a result, the proposed action would not involve a significant changein the probability or consequences of any accident previously evaluated,nor does it involve a new or different kind of accident. Consequently,any radiological releases resulting from an accident would not be significantlygreater than previously determined. The proposed amendments do not otherwiseaffect routine radiological plan effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendments. The Commission also concludes that the proposedaction will not result in a significant increase in individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure.With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendments do notaffect nonradiological plane effluents and have no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.The Notices of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action were published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 21, 1989 (54 FR 7493) for PCN-252,on February 24, 1989 (54 FR 8033) for PCN-281, and on February 24, 1989(54 FR 8035) for PCN-256. No request for hearing or petition for leaveto intervene was filed following this notice.<T3>Alternatives to the Proposed Action: </T3>Because the Commission hasconcluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed action, there is no need to examine alternatives to theproposed action.<T3>Alternative Use of Resources: </T3>This action does not involve theuse of resources not previously considered in connection with the FinalEnvironmental Statement related to operation of San Onofre Nuclear GeneratingStation, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1981 and its Errata dated June 1981.<T3>Agencies and Persons Consulted: </T3>The NRC staff has reviewed thelicensees' request that supports the proposed amendments. The NRC staffdid not consult other agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of no Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendments. Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the applications foramendments dated October 24, 1988, November 7, 1988, and January 16, 1989,which are available for public inspection at the Commission's Public DocumentRoom, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC 20555, and at the General Library,University of California, P.O.
