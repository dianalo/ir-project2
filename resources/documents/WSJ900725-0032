And in London, stocks finished narrowly mixed in modesttrading as an anticipated early advance on Wall Street failedto materialize.</LP><TEXT>   Investors in Asian and Pacific markets were mostlyunperturbed by Monday's volatile trading in New York, whichsent the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than 100points soon after the market opened.   Although the industrial average ended with a 56.44-pointloss, regional markets for the most part followed their ownlocal influences.   Only Hong Kong and New Zealand had sharp falls yesterday.Hong Kong's decline of nearly 2%, the largest drop in theregion, was cast in a relatively positive light. The chiefexplanation was that a correction was overdue after themarket's prolonged rally.   &quot;This is a rather useful buying opportunity,&quot; said PeterEverington, investment director at Thornton Management(Asia).   New Zealand shares slid 1.6%. Investors were worried notonly by the cloud over Wall Street but by the impendingdisclosure of the Wellington government's budget. Singaporestocks fell 0.7%.   Illustrating its isolation from foreign events, Taiwan'sstock market rebounded strongly after plunging the previousday. Its Weighted Price Index surged 5.6%. Likewise, SouthKorean shares responded to internal influences, fallingslightly amid continuing concern over political instability.   In Tokyo, high long-term and short-term interest ratesdried up buying interest, traders said.   Prices finished well above midday lows, however, afterfluctuating widely at lower levels throughout the day.Traders said thin volume permitted index-linked trading --including that by arbitragers -- to sway stocks more widelythan normal.   In Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei index eased another 22.72points to close the morning session at 31679.74.   In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the Nikkei indexrebounded 143.44 points to 31845.90.   Reports Tuesday that U.S. warships in the Persian Gulfwere on alert as Iraq moved 30,000 troops to its border withKuwait pressured Tokyo stock prices, traders said. Theyexplained that stocks fall because of weakened bond pricesresulting from a belief that the situation might strengthenthe dollar.   By the end of the day, most investors concluded that thetension is unlikely to worsen, said Yoshihiro Ito, generalmanager of stock trading at Okasan Securities. He said Iraq'smove appeared to be aimed at pressuring Kuwait to agree tooil-production cuts at the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries meeting that starts in Geneva tomorrow.   Volume on the first section was estimated at 350 millionshares, up from 302 million Monday. Decliners outnumberedadvancers 774-205, with 144 issues unchanged.   The Tokyo Stock Price Index posted a sharper decline thanthe Nikkei index, falling 25.33 points, or 1.09%, to 2304.59.   The Second Section Index dropped 30.88 points, or 0.71%,to 4329.23. Volume was estimated at 15.6 million shares, upfrom 13.5 million Monday.   &quot;All the market attention is focused on interest rates,&quot;said Hiroyuki Murai, general manager of stock trading atNikko Securities.   While a broad range of sectors declined, resource sharessuch as petroleum and mining companies firmed, as they oftendo when the market loses its focus of trade, traders said.   In addition, petroleum shares attracted investors onexpectation that OPEC nations will agree on an oil productioncut, traders said.   Nippon Oil gained 40 yen to 1,480 yen (27 cents to $9.97).Mitsui Mining andamp; Smelting was the day's most active issue,finishing at 858, up 30.   Sony and Kyocera, which have been bought heavily thismonth, received blocks of sell orders from institutions,traders said. Sony was down 80 at 8,720, while Kyocera fell140 to 8,860.   In London, stocks shot higher from the outset, bouncingback from day-earlier losses that dealers said were overdone.But the gains were scaled back on an uninspired Wall Streetstart, the dealers added.   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100 Share Index endedup 1.2 points at 2360.9 after hitting a midmorning peak of2378.1 and a midafternoon minimum of 2351.8.

Reuters Holdings plummeted #1.84 to #10.45 ($3.36 to$19.09) on volume of 5.7 million shares.   Although the news and financial information group reportedinterim results just below the best of market expectations,the stock was clobbered by the company's disclosure that&quot;conditions in financial markets remain difficult andcancellations of Reuter services, which were already high,have recently risen further.&quot;   &quot;In the market's current frame of mind, it's in no moodfor more setbacks, particularly in regard to serviceindustries,&quot; one market professional said. The stock has beena good performer lately and was prone to a setback on anyearnings disappointment, he said.   Oil issues rose across the board. British Petroleum gained7 pence to 340 pence, Enterprise added 14 to 676, Lasmoadvanced 14 to 448, Shell Transport andamp; Trading rose 7 to 489,and Ultramar gained 4 to 343.   Water stocks continued to perform well. Against abackground of uncertainty over profits, corporate downgrades,currency fluctuations and erratic movements on Wall Street,the sector was seen as one of the most secure and stable inthe U.K. market, traders said.   The market's package of 10 water stocks rose 65 to #22.58,Thames Water gained 6 to 228, Anglian Water advanced 7 to228, Severn Trent added 6 to 210, and Southern Water rose 8to 207.
