Bob Hardy, a spokesman for the Health Care Information ResourceCenter which runs the Medicare and Medicaid programs, said theagency will seek another $72 million next year for the program aimedat tapping the nation's largest collection of medical data.   Dr. William L. Roper, head of the HFCA, said the computerizednetwork on treatments, planned to start in 1990, may provide thenext revolution in medical care.   ``We're trying to extend the science,'' Roper said, referring tothe belief among physicians and other practitioners that medicinehas always been a combination of both art and science.   The government has been collecting data on patients' diagnoses,treatments and outcomes since the Medicare insurance program beganin 1965. The information comes from claims billed by physicians,hospitals and other health care providers.   Hardy said the data base has not been used before to analyze themost effective treatments out of concerns for patient privacy, alack of computer resources and fear of government intrusion intomedical practices.   ``The time is ripe for it now,'' Hardy said, adding there is nointent in the program ``to force doctors to use specificprocedures.''   Roper and Hardy acknowledged that quantified data from the fileson various treatments could be used by professional societies,private insurers and the government in setting new treatmentguidelines and ferreting out ineffective or unneccessary practices.   ``That part is secondary,'' Hardy said. ``It's down the pike andwould happen naturally, but ultimately, it would be a by-product.The only way this thing will work successfully is with thecooperation of the medical community.''   At the agency's request, 13 leading physicians convened by theNational Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine met last week topick priority areas where the quantitative studies should begin.   Among a list tentatively chosen were treatments for angina orheart pain, heart attacks, breast cancer, prostate troubles, strokesand hip fractures, Hardy said. Together, they account for billionsof dollars spent on health care annually.   ``In practice, physicians want to do the best by their patientsthat they can,'' Hardy said. ``And when they can plug into a sourceof better, more updated information, we believe they're going to beable to do a better job.''</TEXT></DOC>
