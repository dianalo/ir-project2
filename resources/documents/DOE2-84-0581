In this experiment,distribution feeder equipment on twelve feeders connected to three substationsis being remotely controlled from a central dispatch center. A supervisorycontrol and data acquisition system provides substation and feeder monitoringand remote control of feeder circuit breakers, power reclosers, and loadbreak switches. An analytical study is presented to show the improvementin conventional distribution system reliability indices that are achievedat AUB as a function of the penetration of automation equipment. Thevalue of automation predicted by the study is highly sensitive to thehistorical outage data used in the analysis and to the economic worthof reliability assigned by the utility. Eight case studies are described,from actual AUB operations, where the automation system resulted in significantcost savings and reliability benefits that are not captured by conventionalreliability indices. Other utilities should expect similar benefits,which will be difficult to quantify analytically but, which add to thevalue of and justification for distribution automation.</TEXT></DOC>
