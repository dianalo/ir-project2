Two Cetus patents covering PCR, a process used to amplifythe genetic code, were upheld in a federal court in SanFrancisco last month. Du Pont had sought declaratory reliefsince 1989 to invalidate Cetus's patents, claiming theprocess was anticipated more than a decade earlier byscientists working at the Massachusetts Institute ofTechnology. The six-member jury at that trial rejected all ofDu Pont's 58 claims to invalidate the patents.</LP><TEXT>   Cetus filed a motion in December seeking injunctive reliefto halt the sale of Du Pont products using the PCR patents.Cetus said Du Pont agreed to the injunction at a courtconference held late last week.   PCR acts as a genetic zoom lens to magnify fragments ofthe genetic code for use in diagnostic tests and in forensicanalysis of criminal suspects. The PCR process has manypotential applications, and has been described by Cetusofficials as a market &quot;still in its infancy.&quot;   Last month's jury decision was a big victory for Cetus, asmall company fighting to protect its patent and potentialprofits from a giant contender. But Du Pont's withdrawalwon't necessarily mean a sales windfall for Cetus. Thebiotechnology concern claimed Du Pont's role in the marketwas negligible, and thus it didn't anticipate a rapid salesincrease. &quot;It might mean a small increase in business,&quot; saidPeter Staple, associate general counsel.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Cetusstock closed at $14.125, up 25 cents a share.   The court set a June trial for the next phase oflitigation, to determine whether Du Pont willfully infringedon the Cetus patents, and to set possible damages in thecase.   Cetus said it hadn't determined if other companies alsowere infringing on its patent. &quot;The important thing is thatin the jury trial we vindicated our ownership of thetechnology,&quot; said Katharine Russell, a company spokeswoman.As previously reported, Cetus filed another lawsuit againstDu Pont in December, charging infringement of a recentlyissued patent relating to methods of performing PCR.   In Wilmington, Del., a Du Pont spokesman said the companyhad voluntarily withdrawn commercial sales of its PCRproducts last week. The chemical and natural-resource concernsaid cessation of the sales &quot;is not material in a financialsense.&quot; Du Pont attorneys weren't available to discuss whatlegal alternatives the company is weighing.</TEXT></DOC>
