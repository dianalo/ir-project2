In a move that analysts said could help bolster New York-based Harper andamp; Row's stagnant profits, News Corp. said it would sell the half-interest to William Collins PLC. News Corp. controls 41.7% of Collins's voting stock.    When News Corp. agreed to acquire Harper andamp; Row in March for $300 million, a price analysts considered steep, it disclosed it had opened discussions with Collins about the possibility of Collins acquiring an equity interest in Harper andamp; Row and participating in its management.    Since then, Collins executives have taken an active role in operating Harper andamp; Row. In May, Brooks Thomas, Harper andamp; Row's chairman and chief executive officer, resigned and Collins's chairman, Ian Chapman, and vice chairman, George Craig, were named to head the company temporarily.    Yesterday, News Corp. said Mr. Chapman and Mr. Murdoch will be co-chairmen of Harper andamp; Row.    Messrs. Chapman and Craig won plaudits for reversing Collins's profit slide in the 1970s. The executives &quot;combine the rigor of being accountants with the flamboyance of attracting and keeping good authors,&quot; said Tony Willis, a publishing analyst at London stockbrokerage L. Messel.    Before the acquisition by Australia-based News Corp., Harper andamp; Row profits had been hurt by losses at its London-based medical publishing and packaging unit, Gower Medical Publishing Ltd., and high pension costs, said J. Kendrick Noble Jr., publishing analyst for PaineWebber Inc.    In the fiscal nine months ended Jan. 31, Harper andamp; Row profit fell 14% to $4.4 million while revenue rose 11% to $166.1 million from a year earlier. &quot;The company had had a lackluster earnings performance for some time,&quot; Mr. Noble said. &quot;Most analysts hadn't anticipated the company would do much better.&quot;    News Corp. and Collins already have moved to reverse the profit decline. In June, Harper andamp; Row said it would eliminate about 50 jobs -- about 3% of its work force -- as part of a restructuring and streamlining plan. Among other moves, the company said it also would farm out most of its international trade marketing activities to Collins.    In London, Collins said it hopes to cut Harper andamp; Row's costs by laying off staff, streamlining warehouse and distribution activities and selling &quot;less profitable businesses.&quot;    Founded in 1819, the Glasgow, Scotland-based Collins stumbled badly in the 1970s after buying a loss-ridden U.S. publisher of Bibles, dictionaries and children's books. Collins eventually closed the U.S. unit, after several years of additional losses. Messrs. Chapman and Craig also slashed costs in Collins's book manufacturing and reference-book divisions and jazzed up the company's list of authors, analysts said.    News Corp. officials couldn't be reached for comment. But in a statement, Mr. Murdoch, News Corp. chief executive officer, said that by closely linking the two concerns, &quot;we have the opportunity to develop a truly international book-publishing network.&quot;    Collins would benefit from a presence in the U.S. market, analysts said. &quot;America is the largest English-language market in the world&quot; and crucial for any U.K. publisher, said Luke Johnson, a publishing analyst at London brokers Kleinwort Grieveson Securities.    Collins will finance the acquisition with proceeds from the sale of new shares through a stock rights issue. News Corp. said it agreed to buy a block of the rights issue for about $40 million. </TEXT></DOC>
