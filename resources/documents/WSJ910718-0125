Most Western European countries have olderpopulations than the U.S.; Japan is still younger, but isaging suddenly and massively in the 1990s. As these nationsregister steep hikes in retirement and health-care costs overthe next two decades, the U.S. will be enjoying a demographicIndian summer -- a period of prosperity in which it canprepare gradually for its own senior boom.   The U.S. will grow old in two phases. For the next twodecades, its demographic transformation will be driven almostentirely by a surge in the middle-aged population -- agraying around the temples. Though it is often assumed thatthe elderly population will also be growing rapidly in the1990s, except for the oldest old the ranks of America's agedwill actually increase more slowly than in recent years.</LP><TEXT>   On balance, the demographic changes of the next 20 yearswill confer great economic benefits. As the work force growsmore slowly and middle-ages, increased investment inlabor-saving technology and the rising average skill level ofemployees can both be expected to trigger large gains inproductivity and real wages. With a much larger share ofAmericans reaching their years of high earnings andretirement planning, both theory and a considerable body ofempirical evidence suggest that significant life-cycleincreases in savings may be coming. These developments willalmost certainly boost the nation's income and wealth.   But Indian summers do not last forever. As spiralinggrowth in the number of elderly Americans signals a change inthe weather around the year 2010, the positive impacts ofmiddle-aging could be reversed. Most important, if currentpatterns of retirement and health-care consumption remain onautopilot, by the mid-2020s unreformed Social Security andMedicare will claim between 10% and 17% of GNP, up from just7% today. At 10% of GNP, these costs will become intenselycontroversial; at 17%, they will not be sustainable withoutrobbing other generations and priorities.   America's Indian summer thus represents a window ofopportunity -- and one that is perhaps not just demographicand economic, but political as well. Much research suggeststhat key voter attitudes are related to age, with commitmentto long-term social and economic agendas peaking in mid-life.Over the next two decades, the share of mid-lifers in theU.S. electorate will surge from a postwar low of 30% to anall-time high of 40%. As this shift occurs, support may growfor the types of policy changes that can help the nationprepare for its senior boom.   One change likely to receive a more sympathetic hearingwill be a reversal of the recent restrictive changes infederal policy that have discouraged the expansion of IRAsand pensions. Another will be greater cost-sharing, or even ameans test, in Medicare -- a program that will otherwiserequire large tax hikes long before the 2020s. An entitlementto heavily subsidized health care, regardless of financialneed, is a luxury even a middle-aging society can no longerafford.   But perhaps the most important initiatives will be thosethat shift retirement incentives so that able older peopleare not discouraged from continuing to work and producelonger. Life spans and health spans have lengthened, andemployment is shifting out of industries that place a premiumon youthful vigor. Yet both Social Security and most privatepensions continue to set retirement ages that are early andrigid, after which workers suffer heavy financial penalties.   As America middle-ages, it is to be hoped that the neededchanges will come sooner, allowing gradual shifts in policiesthat erase much of the costs of an aging population withoutcausing wrenching adjustments in individual expectations. Butit is also possible that a confident, working, middle-agedsociety will decide to protect its own future entitlements --or else will just put off addressing the difficult choicesthat lie ahead. If the nation follows the second course inthe 1990s, and its window of opportunity slams shut, it maybe a chilling frost that follows Indian summer.   ---   Mr. Jackson is a research fellow at Hudson Institute inIndianapolis and author of its briefing paper, &quot;America'sIndian Summer: The Economic Impacts of Aging in the 1990s andBeyond.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
