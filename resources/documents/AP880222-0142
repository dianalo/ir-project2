The new danger slowed efforts to reach a buried roomful ofchildren and prompted the mayor to order hundreds of residents to``get out while there's still time.''   Mud-caked survivors flashed thumbs-up signs as they were cartedaway on stretchers, while rescuers moved gingerly about theunstable hillsides in the city.   Scores have died there since the heavy rains began triggeringsporadic floods and mudslides on Friday.   Civil defense officials warned that huge boulders andrain-loosened earth on many hillsides presented an extreme risk ofnew avalanches, particularly in the crowded shantytown slums thatline the hills.   Mayor Roberto Saturnino Braga went on television to orderhundreds of slum dwellers to evacuate their high-risk homes.   ``Get out while there's still time. You may lose yourpossessions, and we regret that. But we're talking about yourlives,'' Braga said.   In the working-class north Rio district of Abolicao, rescueworkers used sledgehammers and spikes to break up concrete slabs ofa three-story apartment building that collapsed under a mudslideSunday night, killing at least nine residents.   Fourteen people were taken alive from the rubble. Televisioncrews broadcasting live from the site showed survivors covered withyellow-brown mud flashing thumbs-up signs as they were borne awayon stretchers.   Civil defense spokeswoman Sonia Hadid said workers expected tofind as many as 11 bodies under the rubble.   ``There was a children's party going on in one of the apartmentswhen it collapsed, so we don't know how many were in there,'' Ms.Hadid said by telephone.   In the Santa Teresa district near downtown Rio, 80 firemensearched for bodies under the debris of a hillside clinic for theelderly that was hit by a mud avalanche late Friday. A three-storypavillion of the clinic collapsed and at least 11 patients died.   Rescue efforts were slowed by rain and by a warning fromengineers that a new mudslide could occur at any moment in SantaTeresa.   ``They have to work carefully, using blowtorches and sledges,removing the metal, concrete and wood. When it starts to rain, theystop. Otherwise the whole hillside could come down,'' Ms. Hadidsaid.   The spokeswoman said the death toll of 75 included only bodiesthat had reached the morgue and ``the final total certainly will behigher.''   The number of dead varied almost daily as civil defenseauthorities struggled to get a clear picture of the tragedy's humantoll.   Nearly 9,500 were without homes, a drop from previous daysbecause some flood victims began moving back to their dwellings.   State health officials began a massive vaccination campaignagainst tetanus and leptospirosis, a sometimes fatal infectioncaused by water contaminated with rat urine and droppings. Earlierreports indicated erroneously that leprosy was feared.   Public service messages on radio and television urged people notto walk barefoot through flood water and to boil their drinkingwater or treat it with chlorine.   Braga declared a state of public calamity in Rio and estimatedthe damage at $150 million.   The weather bureau said the unusually heavy rain was caused byan antarctic cold front. The forecast was for more rain and gradualclearing by Wednesday.   Earlier this month, 207 people died in flooding and mudslidesaround the state and 13,000 were left homeless.</TEXT></DOC>
