The Ukraine, a key center for Soviet industry andagriculture with a population of 52 million, has so farrefused to take part in an economic treaty signed Friday byeight other republics, and it hasn't sent representatives toa session of the national parliament that began this week.</LP><TEXT>   A referendum on independence is due to be held in theUkraine Dec. 1, and officials in Kiev are wary of forginglinks with other republics until then. Indeed, they aresteering the other way: The republic is making progress withplans to issue its own currency and establish its own armedforces, independent of Moscow.   Evhen Marchuk, the republic's minister of emergencysituations and state security, convened a meeting of generalsover the weekend to elaborate a military plan, which foreseesthe republic maintaining 420,000 troops, a separate air forceand its own arms production.   According to the proposal, the republic would honorinternational arms agreements and &quot;is determined to graduallytransform to the status of a neutral and nuclear-free state.&quot;The plan was endorsed yesterday by the Ukrainian parliament.   Such moves are sending shock waves through Moscow, whereofficials fear that a go-it-alone Ukraine could destroy hopesof salvaging a new political structure for the Soviet Unionfollowing the failed August coup. Mr. Gorbachev and theleaders of eight republics, including Russia, went so far asto issue a formal appeal to the Ukraine not to turn its backon historic links with the rest of the nation. The Ukraine's&quot;role in the development of our country, in everything ofwhich our peoples can rightly be proud, is irreplaceable,&quot;the appeal said.   The appeal followed some scarcely veiled criticism of therepublic by Mr. Gorbachev Monday. He told deputies to thenational parliament that &quot;participation in the new {economic}union will be an enormous advantage and not a burden,&quot; andsharply attacked efforts by the Ukraine and some otherrepublics to establish their own military. &quot;As president, Iam responsible for {defense},&quot; he said, adding that he wouldoverrule any attempts to nationalize units of the Sovietarmed forces.   But some in Kiev dismiss such talk as empty threats. &quot;InMoscow they say stupid things,&quot; says Dmytro Pavlychko,chairman of the Ukraine parliament's Foreign AffairsCommittee. &quot;We won't go where {authorities in Moscow} want usto go. There is no union. That nation is past.&quot;   Mr. Pavlychko and some other Ukrainian officials areskeptical about the recently signed economic agreement, whichthey say isn't workable. But opinion is divided on the issue,a sign of the intense conflict in the republic prior to theDecember referendum. Prime Minister Vitold Fokin, who signeda draft of the economic agreement but then backed away fromsupporting it, reportedly said this week that the Ukraineshould sign if its reservations are taken into account. Buthis aides in Kiev now strongly deny that Mr. Fokin made anysuch remark.   Even as the debate continues, the republic is gearing fora limited dose of economic separatism. Parliament recentlycreated a capital fund for the republic's new central bank,and the government has ordered special multiple-use couponsthat must be used when purchasing products in Ukrainianstores. These coupons, reportedly being printed in France,are designed to prevent an outflow of goods to otherrepublics. They could eventually lead to a separate currency,an issue that remains highly controversial here.   While Kiev is reluctant to sign agreements that leave anyrole for a central government in Moscow, it doesn't rule outeconomic ties with other republics. The most important ofthese, an accord with its giant neighbor Russia, has been onthe drawing board for weeks.   But as Mr. Gorbachev turns up the heat on the republic,many Ukrainians are nervous that Russia, too, may seek topressure it into a broad economic alliance. Officials in Kievtalk darkly about the possibility of a Russian tradeblockade, and are working out countermeasures. Worried thatRussia may withhold crucial supplies of oil, for example,officials say they would retaliate by taxing Russian oil thatflows through pipelines on Ukrainian territory.</TEXT></DOC>
