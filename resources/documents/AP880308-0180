Women who still yearn to wear the big cats can now choose theFendi sisters' version consisting of ocelot markings printed onsynthetic fur fabric coats with the added bonus of cuffs in realsable.   Karl Lagerfeld, who designs the Fendi collection, is never shorton witty ideas and when he wasn't making fabric look like fur, hewas reversing the process to make furs imitate fabrics. His longwinter coats in shaved weasel worked to look like corduroy velvetwere a case in point.   There were plenty of other surprises, such as the big muffs inchinchilla or sable which, at a flick of the models' wrists, becamecomplete fur coats.   But although Lagerfeld had his fun with the fakes, he alsoindulged in the real thing, showing styles in sumptuous mink,sable, ermine and Mongolian lamb so lavish that that they couldretail for as much as $100,000.   Favored shapes included high-waisted, oval-skirted coats thatharked back to the fashions in vogue in the early 1920s. Shoulderswere soft and natural with padding sent into retirement.   There were spectacular capes such as the circular version inblack-dyed mole threaded intricately into lace, and shapely coatsin black ermine worked to look like shiny and matte-striped silkvelvet.   A princess-line coat, fitted and flared, came in woven gray wooland had an extra layer of warmth in its luxury lining of sumptuouschinchilla.</TEXT></DOC>
