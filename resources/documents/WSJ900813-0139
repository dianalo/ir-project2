Results of the vote by the 140,000 members who work forUPS are expected today.</LP><TEXT>   A UPS spokesman said both sides acceded to a request bythe Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to continuebargaining over a new three-year contract.   No union spokesman who would discuss the issue could bereached. Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a dissident groupbased in Detroit, said one local had received two messagesfrom the union's headquarters, the first denying anyagreement to keep negotiating, but the second acknowledgingthat the union would continue the talks.   A spokesman for the mediation service said the agency doesintend to ask the union and the UPS to keep bargaining, andhe said the agency is &quot;optimistic&quot; that they will agree to doso.   The current contract expired Aug. 1. The Teamsters agreedto keep working and to extend the deadline for counting theballots until last Friday. Any majority vote againstratifying the offer would empower the Teamsters leaders tocall a strike. Both the union's leadership and the dissidentgroup have recommended that the rank-and-file reject the UPSoffer.   TDU officials say this isn't a good time a strike. Theimpact on UPS business would be diminished, because August isa slow month for small-parcel deliveries. The union would dobetter to wait until the busy October-December deliveryseason approaches, they say.   But union leaders and members may also be concerned thatUPS, the nation's largest small-package delivery firm, mightlose market share from a strike. The Postal Service isgearing up to absorb some of the UPS business if there's astrike, and some other firms have developed new distributionschemes to make up for loss of UPS service.   The TDU, in fact, has urged negotiators to return to thebargaining table. It suggested that members aren't &quot;eager tostrike&quot; and said that &quot;UPS Teamsters are proud of thetop-notch service UPS provides.&quot;   The UPS has called its offer &quot;final,&quot; the same term itused for an earlier offer that union negotiators spurned. Thelatest offer includes a wage increase of 50 cents an hour, orabout 3%; a cost-of-living raise capped at 20 cents an hour,in the second and third years of the contract; signingbonuses; a lower-wage tier for new employees, and an increaseof 35 cents an hour in the employer contribution to thehealth and welfare fund and the pension fund.</TEXT></DOC>
