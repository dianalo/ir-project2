John Tower,president-elect Bush's choice to head the Defense Department,committee chairman Sam Nunn said today.   ``The committee will have a higher set of standards ... for theentire team,'' from Tower down through the Pentagon's top set ofmanagers, Nunn, D-Ga., told a group of reporters in a wide-ranginginterview.   Asked whether Tower would receive kid-glove treatment at hisconfirmation hearing next month before the panel he formerlychaired, Nunn said: ``We are not going to play the old-boy game thisgo-around.''   Nunn said he and Sen. John Warner of Virginia, the panels'ranking Republican, would insist on seeing the full report on Towerby the FBI, which conducted an extensive background investigationfollowing allegations of womanizing and drinking, and reports aboutTower's coziness with the defense industry.   Defense analysts and congressional observers have predicted thatTower, chairman of the panel during the first half of the Reaganadministration, would receive deferential treatment and breeze toconfirmation.   But Nunn said he did not want to repeat the mistakes of Tower'searly tenure as chairman, when former top Pentagon official MelvynPaisley was confirmed. Paisley now figures prominently in thegovernment's defense procurement fraud case.   On other subjects, Nunn said:   _ The government should focus its attention on cleaning upnuclear messes at its aging nuclear weapons production facilitiesaround the country and restoring safety to neglected reactors,including those at the Savannah River plant in South Carolinasoutheast of Augusta.   The United States will not run into a shortage of tritium for usein nuclear weapons for ``a year or two,'' he said, and that prospectposes no immediate threat to national security. ``We've got to findthe money to modernize and clean up,'' he said, adding that theEnergy Department, which runs the facilities, should concentrate ongetting one reactor restarted at Savannah River, rather thanspreading its resources too thinly.   _ While the South African government has eased restrictions onsome well-known anti-apartheid activists like Nelson Mandela, itcontinues to imprison younger, nonviolent protesters withoutapparent cause. Nunn returned Friday from a two-week trip to SouthAfrica, Kenya and Zaire.   ``There is not the kind of communication necessary if SouthAfrica's problems are going to be solved peacefully,'' Nunn said,adding that Congress will have to look closely in the coming year atpossible new sanctions, including American disinvestment.   _ It would be ``unrealistic'' to expect a new vote in Congressany time soon on renewal of military aid to Nicaragua's Contrarebels. The new Bush administration should instead focus its firstattention on working with neighboring countries in Central Americato make sure the leftist Sandinista government lives up to promisesmade to its neighbors in a regional peace plan, he said.   _ He will introduce early in the 101st Congress legislation thatwould provide for a broad new program of voluntary national servicefor young Americans beginning at age 18. The incoming Senatemajority leader, George Mitchell of Maine, ``wants to make that oneof the top priorities for the Democratic majority,'' Nunn said,adding he expects substantial Republican support as well.   Nunn said he hoped the idea, which would include both militaryand civilian service and encompass expanded VISTA and Peace Corpsprograms, could be enacted into law within two years.</TEXT></DOC>
