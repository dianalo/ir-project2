Use a separate directory for your documents.andP;  Ihave WordPerfect configured to save files to a directory named C:\WPFILES.andO;The result is a significantly faster file listing of nothing but what I havewritten.andP;  Similarly, I save my World documents to C:\WORDDOCS, MultiMatedocuments to C:\MMFILES, Word for Windows files to C:\WWFILES, and so on.andP;  Infact, I use this method for all my programs, since it simplifies backups aswell.andM;PHONE DIALINGandM;There are a number of memory-resident utility programs that can pick a numberoff the screen and dial it on your phone via the computer's modem.andP;  The macroshown in Figure 1 lets you do the same task from within a WordPerfectdocument.andM;In order to use the macro, your printer must be set up to address thecommunications port used by your modem.andP;  To do this, Press Shift-F7 to bringup the print menu, S to select a printer, A for additional printers, and thenchoose &quot;DOS Text Printer&quot; from the list of dot matrix printers.andM;WordPerfect will then present the &quot;Printer Select Edit&quot; screen, which allowsyou to configure a printer.andP;  To start, select option 1 and change the printername so that it starts with the number 0.andP;  The new printer will move to thetop of the list.andP;  This way it will be easy for your macro to select theprinter.andP;  You must also change the Port (option 2) to either COM1 orCOM2--whichever one your modem uses.andP;  You'll then be prompted to add thecommunications parameters.andP;  I use 300 bps, 7 character bits, 1 stop bit, andeven parity--although other settings should work just as well.andP;  Once thesettings are adjusted, press the exit key (F7) to return to the previousmenu.andM;Now you will need to change the name of your default printer so that it movesto the end of the list.andP;  In order to do this, simply insert the letter Zbefore the name.andP;  For example, my printer list starts with 0 dial com2 andends with Z Standard Printer.andM;Once you are set up, you can go ahead and use the macro.andP;  In your document,place the cursor on a number that you want to dial and call up the macro.andO;Note that the phone number cannot contain any blanks, but it is acceptablefor it to contain hyphens and parentheses.andM;The macro will change printers to the new entry.andP;  It will then copy the phonenumber to the end of your document and precede it with the dial command usedby Hayes-compatible modems.andP;  The copied line will be sent to the printerusing the Block Print command.andP;  It may be a few seconds before you hear themodem dial, so you will have to be patient.andM;The macro will pause until you press enter.andP;  At that point, it willdisconnect the modem and reset the printer default to the choice located atthe bottom of the printer list.andM;Although the macro is not as powerful or fast as many telephone utilityprograms, it should meet the needs of many users.andP;  in addition, it can becombined with the WordPerfect Search and Sort commands to create a simpleline-format telephone directory.andM;Robert F. MouradianandM;Cincinnati, OhioandM;On occasion we receive tips from readers that make us do a double take.andO;After reading Mr. Mouradian's suggestion, I stared at the printer setupscreen of WordPerfect, wondering why I hadn't thought of the idea.andM;I've altered Mr. Mouradian's macro to eliminate the step of renaming printersand to cut down on unnecessary cursor movements (such as copying the phonenumber to the end of the document).andP;  Creating a new printer definition forthe modem is the only step one need take other than defining a macro.andP;  Mr.andO;Mouradian could have used WordPerfect's native macro programming language todefine the printer, but his own method keeps the process simple andintuitive.andM;TIPS FROM WORKING WORDSMITHSandM;Tell fellow users about your latest word processing tips, and we'll pay you$50 for any tips we print.andP;  Please send your letter on a disk along with aprintout.andP;  Mail your contributions to The Working Word, PC Magazine, One ParkAvenue, New York, NY 10016, or upload them to PC MagNet.andM;Costa Rodis is a computer consultant in New York City.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
