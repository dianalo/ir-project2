Some of the results of this program, presentlyunder way, are presented herein, i.e. the comparison of the automaticand optical settlement data, and the geotechnical evaluation of the maximumsettlement recorded by the system during the 1985 refueling of the plant.The level indicator system is finally shown to provide a basis for thedevelopment of an expert system that can perform and automatic, continuousand real-time foundation safety control of the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
