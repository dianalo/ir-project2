I knowwhat he wants: he wants to see me dead. Not only me but you, andyou, and you, all of us, that's what he wants,'' Shamir saidWednesday during a nationally broadcast Israel Television interview.   He also said he has been holding meetings with Palestinians fromthe occupied territories in an effort to form a representativegroup to negotiate with Israel even before a government peace planis put into effect. He said the Arabs involved were not linked tothe Palestine Liberation Organization.   The prime minister, reacting to reports that indirect talks havebeen held between Israel and the PLO, said even Arafat's acceptanceof Israel's peace initiative would not change his mind abouttalking to the PLO leader.   ``I'm not expecting anything from Yasser Arafat. I don't see inany future any spark of understanding between myself and thisguy,'' Shamir said.   He denied claims by the PLO and Israeli legislators that Israelwas conducting indirect talks with the PLO. Senior officials andlegislators from the left-of-center Labor Party said Wednesday thatIsrael was in contact with the PLO in an effort to win approval ofthe peace plan.   The Labor Party and Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc are uneasypartners in a coalition government.   The peace initiative calls for electing Palestinians in theoccupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip to negotiate with Israel oninterim self-rule, with later talks on the final status of theterritories.   ``The fact that there are negotiations on this subject with thePLO is clear and it has one aim: to get a green light from the PLOfor elections in the territories,'' Yossi Beilin, an aide to LaborParty leader Shimon Peres, said on Israel army radio. He said thecontacts were carried out through the United States, Egypt andRomania.   But Shamir said even indirect negotiations with the PLO areimpossible.   ``This...government has in its guidelines a permanent and stableprinciple: there are no and there will be no negotiations withPLO.''   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist group.   He also reiterated that Israel would not accept a Palestinianstate. The Palestinian National Council, a legislature-in-exile,declared such a state in November.   Despite his other comments, Shamir confirmed that he had metwith Jamil Tarifi, a pro-PLO Palestinian lawyer.   Israeli sources said Wednesday the PLO has proposed forming adelegation of 10 residents from the occupied territories and twoPalestinian-Americans to meet with Israeli officials on theelections proposal.   The sources, who demanded anonymity, said delegation memberswould eventually emerge as candidates in the elections and beassured victory with PLO backing.</TEXT></DOC>
