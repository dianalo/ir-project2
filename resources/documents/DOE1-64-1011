K and C are regression parameters. Logisticregression in assorted imaging modalities yielded r/sup 2/ values rangingfrom 0.95 to 0.99. A figure of merit (FOM), the area under the CD curve(AUC), is obtained by integrating the logistic function over mathematicallyand clinically acceptable limits. For count densities of 200 counts/cm/sup2/ and 1,000 counts/cm/sup 2/, the AUC differed approximately by a factorof 2. Thus, the AUC may be a sensitive FOM.</TEXT></DOC>
