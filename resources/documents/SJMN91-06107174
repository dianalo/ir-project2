Lawmakers-- who conclude the first round of hearings on the Bush bill this week -- havefumed about the administration's shortsightedness. But with Congress dividedbetween the urban-dominated House of Representatives and the rural-leaningSenate, they have yet to offer clear alternatives.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  DESPITE CITY TRAFFIC JAMS, FUNDING TAKESRURAL ROUTE  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Chart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     That leaves the Bay Area at a dead end. Most local roads have been widenedas far as possible, and clean-air laws -- backed by environmental agenciesready to sue to enforce them -- make it nearly impossible to pour moreconcrete. Without increased emphasis on mass transit and traffic-reductionprograms, local experts say, the most a Bay Area motorist can expect from anannual, $70 federal gas-tax bill are smoother cross-country trips and aspeedier weekend jaunt to Eureka.;    &quot;Truckers will love it,&quot; Santa ClaraCounty Supervisor Rod Diridon said, &quot;but not the average citizen who has towait in traffic to get to work.&quot;;    THE Bush administration, for its part,rejects the notion that the federal government should focus on urbanmotorists' miseries. To replace the interstate program, finally complete after35 years, it is proposing a 150,000-mile National Highway System dubbed &quot;Sonof Interstate&quot; by local critics. The president would designate only $16.5billion for mass transit -- less than half the level the Carter administrationspent 10 years ago -- on the theory that rush-hour traffic jams are localproblems that local dollars should solve.;    But critics say the federalgovernment cannot so easily disavow its responsibility for urban congestion.They contend federal policy helped create that congestion by enticing city andcounty planners to favor roadways over railways by offering federal money for90 percent of the cost of an interstate highway but for only half the cost ofa transit line.;    Seduced by these financial incentives, &quot;we all gotinterstate-itis,&quot; Caltrans assistant director Carl Williams said. &quot;We decidedinterstate roadways would solve all our problems. Transit and local roadwayswere neglected.&quot;;    Local commuters can see the evidence of this neglect eachtime they drive Highway 237. Eligible for only small amounts of federalfunding, that aging and heavily used expressway is only now being upgraded tofreeway status, using the proceeds of a local sales tax.;    &quot;It was almost asif federal policy told us that people who wanted to travel from Sunnyvale toMilpitas should go down I-280 and then back up I-880&quot; rather than on 237, saidLawrence Dahms, executive director of the Metropolitan TransportationCommission, which oversees transportation planning in the Bay Area. &quot;So that'swhat we told people, too.&quot;;    Dahms and Williams said the Bush plan carrieson that same big-road logic -- vigorously. For the first time, theadministration is proposing to give extra federal cash for national highwaysto the states that consume the most gasoline -- in effect, creating adisincentive for local mass transit.;    &quot;In Santa Clara County, we're lookingat spending 70 to 80 percent of our total transportation dollars on (mass)transit programs&quot; in the next 20 years, San Jose City Councilman Jim Beallsaid. That spending plan reverses priorities of the last decade, when 70percent to 80 percent of all money spent on transportation in the county wentto highways.;    What federal policy will determine is the speed with whichlocal improvements occur. Even though the last two federal administrationshave shorted transit programs, new railways rarely are built without help:Federal funds accounted for more than 60 percent of California's total transitconstruction budget last year. BART is one of the few large systems that wentahead without money from Washington, but local officials say they will needassistance for planned extensions to San Jose and San Francisco InternationalAirport.;    In the coming months, the arguments to kill Bush's &quot;Son ofInterstate&quot; will be made time and time again in Congress. Urban areas fromOrlando, Fla., to Los Angeles are anxious to promote ways of traveling to workother than the highway.;    Rep. Norm Mineta, D-San Jose, leads the housesubcommittee charged with rewriting the Bush bill, and he says the federalpenchant for paving the prairies has to end.;    'I  WAS driving away from anairport in West Virginia a few weeks ago,&quot; Mineta said recently, &quot;and suddenlywe were on a four-lane, divided highway, out in the middle of nowhere. And Iasked myself, what is this doing here? It probably carries as much traffic ina year as a San Jose road carries in three weeks.&quot;;     But urban politiciansexpect trouble in the Senate, where rural politicians argue that heavy federalparticipation in a national highway system is vital to their lightlypopulated, cash-poor states.;    To that, critics such as Beall counter thatthe United States already has a good system for trucks and buses, and that thetransportation crisis facing the nation today is congestion in urban areas.;   &quot;We've been paying our taxes,&quot; Beall said. &quot;Now it's our turn.&quot;; WHO GETSMONEY FOR HIGHWAY WORK; These numbers show how many dollars each state willreceive -- per capita -- under President Bush's plan for the 150,000-mileNational Highway System.; ...; State                           Amount; Alaska                        $440.94; North Dakota                   $149.60;District of Columbia            $65.97; Oregon                         $45.25; California                      $24.26; New York                       $17.22; ...; California drivers pay an average of $70 annually in federalgasoline taxes to the National Highway Fund.; ...; Source:   Federal HighwayAdministration  </TEXT><BYLINE>  BERT ROBINSON AND DEBORAH ANDERLUH, Mercury News Staff Writers  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  WASHINGTON  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910416  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,008  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday April 16, 199100107174,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
