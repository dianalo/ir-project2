Rabin's statement came as parts of the occupied West Bank wereparalyzed by a strike to protest the shooting deaths of fourPalestinians by Israeli troops. Arab and hospital reports said twomore Palestinians died Saturday after clashes with soldiers.   ``In confrontation, the rioters should suffer casualties andscars, so that they know it would not end with detentions. This ismy policy and I'm responsible for it,'' Israel radio quoted Rabinas saying.   Dozens of black mourning flags flew from rooftops in curfewedNablus, the West Bank's largest Arab city, where the four were shotFriday.   Clashes flared Saturday in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, andArab reports said troops shot and killed one Palestinian andwounded 18 others. Israel television quoted Arab sources as sayingas many as 30 Palestinians were wounded.   The army command confirmed the 18 casualties but said the deathwas caused by a local feud.   In Nablus' Ittihad Hospital, 23-year-old Hamad Abdel Kader fromthe nearby El Ein refugee camp died Saturday of a head woundsuffered during a Sept. 26 demonstration, officials said.   Kader's funeral procession sparked a riot in the curfewed camp,and Israeli troops opened fire on mourners who unfurled outlawedPalestinian flags, wounding seven people, an Arab reporter inNablus said.   The army command confirmed the casulaties.   The army imposed a curfew on about 120,000 Palestinians inNablus and the neighboring refugee camps after violent clashesFriday. In those incidents, Arab reports said four Arabs werekilled and 21 wounded, but the army Saturday confirmed only twodeaths and 14 wounded.   ``We know that other people have perished, but we don't know thecircumstances,'' a military spokesman said, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   Nablus' streets were deserted except for army patrols. At onepoint, demonstrators violated the curfew and threw stones atsoldiers, an Arab reporter said. The army said three Palestinianswere wounded in the clash.   Around the West Bank towns of Qalqilya, Tulkarem and Jenin,Palestinians staged a strike in solidarity with Nablus residents.   Palestinians burned tires and hurled rocks at the troops, who inresponse shot and wounded four people, the military command said.   In the West Bank village of Yabad near Tulkarem, Ahmad ZeidKelani, 28, died after being shot in the chest Saturday, hospitalofficials said.   Circumstances of the death were not immediately clear. The armysaid it was apparently caused by a feud between villagers, but Arabreports said soldiers shot Kelani.   Israel radio said several shots were fired during a fistfightbetween rival families but said an army patrol was attacked when itentered the village to separate the foes.   Saturday's fatalities raised to 291 the number of Palestinianskilled since the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupationbegan Dec. 8. Six Israelis have died in clashes during the sameperiod.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, the army clamped a curfew on fivetowns and refugee camps, affecting at least 100,000 people.   In Gaza Strip clashes, four Palestinians were wounded, the armysaid.   The radio quoted Rabin as saying 7,000 Palestinians have beenwounded and 18,000 detained since the uprising began. Of them, some5,600 are still in jail, with about 2,000 serving sentences of upto six months without trial.   In spite of the high number of casualties and detentions, Rabinwas quoted as saying, the army still failed to achieve its goal of``restoring quiet and maintaining Israeli control'' in the occupiedterritories.   The radio was banned from broadcasting Rabin's voice following alaw forbidding it to air voices of candidates competing in the Nov.1 parliamentary elections. Rabin runs for the left-leaning LaborParty.   Also Saturday, authorities detained five ultra-Orthodox Jewsduring a religious riot during which stones were thrown at passingcars and police in a Jerusalem neighborhood, Israel radio said.   They were protesting what they view as violations of the JewishSabbath, the biblically mandated day of rest which lasts fromsundown Friday till sundown Saturday. Jewish law forbids any work,including driving, on Sabbath.</TEXT></DOC>
