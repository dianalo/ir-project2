(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six activists were arrested for blocking arailroad track at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant during areunion of protesters who were at a massive demonstration 10 yearsago.   ``There wasn't any planned civil disobedience. It was allspontaneous,'' activist Ellen Klaver said of Sunday's protest.``The attitude of the police had a lot to do with it. They were sorigid.''   The demonstrators marched 10 miles from Boulder to Rocky Flats,where about 150 people who gathered on the tracks for then, pitched tentsand danced the ``Hokey Pokey.'' Many hadparticipated in protests that began A 10-yearreuniopril 29, 1978, when dozenswere arrested.

You'reparticipating in murder.'. ``I'd never done anything like that before.Wereally got to know each other because of our common cause. We werevery supportive and loving.''
