The foreign banks also said the Italian government shouldhonor Federconsorzi's debts because the cooperative is a &quot;defacto public entity.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Representatives of about 30 banks with a total exposure ofabout 380 billion lire ($278.6 million) met Thursday inLondon to review the Italian government's proposal for acourt-supervised settlement between Federconsorzi and its2,500 creditors. Federconsorzi has total debts of more thaneight trillion lire.   A banker who was at Thursday's meeting said the banks haveasked their legal advisers to determine whether there is anyground for legal action and if so, where to file suit. Thebanks again said they will insist on full payment of theirloans and said they expect the Italian government &quot;to find anappropriate solution.&quot;   Italian officials have said they regretted the situationbut that foreign creditors couldn't be granted moreprivileged treatment than domestic ones.   Federconsorzi, which is owned by farmers' unions butgoverned through the Agriculture Ministry, has interests infood processing, agricultural machinery and financialservices. In May, Agriculture Minister Giovanni Goria removedFederconsorzi's management and appointed three commissionersto draw up a plan to settle its debts.   After an initial plan was rejected by creditors, thegovernment this month proposed a court-supervised settlementthat would guarantee creditors payment of at least 40% of themoney owed.   The foreign banker said the London meeting didn't discussthe issue of Agrifactoring, Federconsorzi's factoring unitthat is 50%-owned by Banca Nazionale del Lavoro. BNL, ownedby the country's Treasury, is Italy's second largest bank.   Foreign banks are owed about 240 billion lire byAgrifactoring and are holding BNL responsible for repayment.BNL, which itself has a large exposure to Federconsorzi andAgrifactoring, has rejected any claims, sayingAgrifactoring's problems stem from Federconsorzi and that itis an integral part of the cooperative.</TEXT></DOC>
