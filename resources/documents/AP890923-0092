They call it ``the bubble.''   Here's what it means: If the president (who's paid $200,000) andyour bachelor governor with no income except an $85,000 salary win$1,000 each in the lottery, the president must pay $280 in tax onthat additional income and the governor must pay $330.   To House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., ``the bubble ... is adistortion, it is totally topsy-turvy, upside down of everythingthat we have ever considered fair, reasonable tax policy.''   Americans have grown up with the notion that the more you make,the greater portion of each dollar you pay in tax. The stripped-downtax-rate structure enacted in 1986 conflicts with that tradition.   Draw a bar graph of traditional income tax rates and you see aseries of stairsteps leading upward. But the new law has three stepsup and then _ for the really high-income earners _ one step down.   That step down is ``the bubble,'' which benefits the nation'srichest 600,000 couples and individuals.   The quirk is at the heart of a steaming tax battle betweencongressional Democrats and President Bush.   As part of their plan to kill Bush's proposed capital-gains taxcut, Foley and fellow Democratic leaders in the House are trying toburst ``the bubble.'' Eliminating it would take more taxes from thewealthiest and use the money to allow deductible IndividualRetirement Accounts for all workers and to cut the budget deficit.   Here's what ``the bubble'' is all about:</TEXT><TEXT>   The tax law now has three tax rates: 15 percent, 28 percent and33 percent. Every taxpayer pays the lowest rate. For about 80percent of Americans, it is the only rate they pay; every taxabledollar they earn is taxed at a rate of 15 percent.   For a single person, the bottom rate applies to all taxableincome _ what is left after deductions and personal exemptions aresubtracted _ up to $18,550. For a couple filing a joint return, the15 percent bracket covers taxable income up to $30,950.   Suppose Jill Lunchbucket has taxable income of $18,000 and gets a$1,000 pay raise. Step 2 of the rate structure comes into play. Thefirst $18,550 is taxed at 15 percent and the additional $450 istaxed at 28 percent.   Jill has moved up into the 28 percent marginal tax bracket,meaning that any additional income _ another pay raise, winning afootball pool or interest on a new savings account _ will be taxedat 28 percent.   Suppose she's elected football commissioner and gets a $70,000raise. Assuming she has no extra deductions, that pushes her taxableincome to $89,000 and produces this tax picture:   _$18,550 is taxed at 15 percent, resulting in $2,782.50 in tax.   _The next $26,350 is taxed at 28 percent, or $7,378.   _The remaining $44,900 is taxed at 33 percent, or $14,553.   That means a total tax of $24,713.50.   ``The bubble'' does not affect Jill because her taxable income isunder the $93,130 level at which it comes into play.   But consider Jack Bigbucks, who also is single, makes $500,000 ayear and has taxable income of $400,000. He has to figure his taxesdifferently.   That is because congressional tax-writers, in crafting the 1986overhaul, decreed that singles with taxable incomes above $93,130and couples above $155,320 with no dependents pay a flat 28 percentrate on every penny of taxable income. Also, the very rich get notax benefit from personal exemptions.   So, for Jack:   _The entire $400,000 is taxed at 28 percent, for a tax of$112,000.   _Losing the tax saving from his $2,000 personal exemption adds$560 (28 percent of $2,000) to his tax bill.   That gives Jack a tax liability of $112,560.   The Democrats want to remove that ``bubble'' _ prevent the 33percent rate from dropping back to 28 percent. They would tax all ofJack's taxable income over $44,900 at 33 percent. That would mean:   _$18,550 taxed at 15 percent, a tax of $2,782.50.   _The next $26,350 taxed at 28 percent, or $7,378.   _The remaining $355,100 taxed at 33 percent, or $117,183.   Jack would have a total tax bill of $127,343.50 _ or $14,783.50more than under present law.</TEXT></DOC>
