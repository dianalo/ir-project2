(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Think of Hewlett-Packard's 7550A as a magical black box into which you merelypour HPGL, and out come completed plots! The procedure is so elegant that youneed hardly even think about it.andP;  The 7550A is among the fastest plottersreviewed here and, overall, the best.andP;  It's also expensive: $3,900 for thebasic plotter with two carousels, trays for A-size paper, media samplers, andassorted pens.andM;With its standard-equipment automatic paper-feeding mechanism, the 7550Aearns the title, &quot;prestidigitator of plotters.andP;  &quot; Stack up to 150 sheets ofpaper (or 100 blank transparencies) in its front drawer, and it will plotthrough the entire stack without further attention.andM;In one brief in-and-out movement, the 7550A aligns each sheet precisely andspins it into the proper position for plotting.andP;  In a snap, it ejects eachsheet with enough momentum to propel it halfway to Omaha.andP;  HP supplies apaper tray that attaches to the rear of the 7550A to intercept the flight ofthe sheets.andM;A CLASSIC CASEandM;The 7550A is a classic drum plotter (it was HP that patented the drum design)that uses grit wheels to hold each sheet of drafting medium in place.andO;Because the wheels are fixed in spacing, the 7550A is set in the size of themedia it can handle: A-size sheets feed in laterally; B-size sheetslongitudinally.andP;  Maximum plot size measures 9.97 by 16.12 inches.andP;  (Theself-contained automatic paper-feeding system ships as standard equipment,but it handles only A-size paper.andP;  Trays to handle European media sizes and11- by 17-inch B-size sheets are options.)andM;This somewhat large machine-8.5 by 26 by 17 inches (HWD) overall-allows morethan enough room for a fast, robust mechanism, one capable of moving its penat up to 31.5 inches per second.andP;  Paper movements are equally brisk, witheach sheet shuttle so fast as to become a nervous blur.andM;Quality is not compromised for the 7550A's speed.andP;  The 0.00025-inchmechanical resolution of the 7550A is hardly tapped by the 0.001-inch stepsize addressable by HPGL.andP;  Obviously, there are no compatibility problemswith HPGL, and your plots come out just as sharp as they do with the otherplotters from Hewlett-Packard.andM;The eight pens that the 7550A wields are held in a removable carousel thatautomatically caps those not in use.andP;  Hewlett-Packard offers differentcarousels for different pen types  fiber-tipped pens for either paper ortransparency); the carousels themselves carry coding that causes the 7550A toalter its plotting speed to match the different types of pens.andP;  Despite its12K internal buffer, the 7550A does not optimize pen motion.andM;Two interfaces and three connectors are standard equipment on the 7550A.andP;  Twoof the connectors are for RS-232 linkups: one connects to your PC, and theother extends the PC port to reach to another serial device.andP;  The otherconnector is for an IEEE-488 (GPIB) cable.andM;NO MORE DIP SWITCHESandM;Instead of DIP switches and jumpers, the 7550A features a completelymenu-driven setup procedure using its small control panel and a 2-fine by20-character LCD display.andP;  Pressing control panel buttons sets thenonvolatile memory in the plotter for serial port parameters and otheroperating characteristics.andM;As simple as it might at first appear, the actual procedure is obscure, withsome settings and values that you are unlikely to have encountered anywherebefore.andP;  You may know enough to choose hardwire handshaking but are leftwondering whether or not the plotter requires a &quot;direct&quot; or a &quot;remote&quot; PCconnection.andP;  The Hewlett-Packard manual helps sort through the choices byoffering a single set of recommended PC settings.andM;The control panel is also used for normal plotter commands, includingaltering plot size, location, and orientation; digitizing; and manuallyselecting pens.andP;  Hewlett-Packard bestows a one-year warranty on the ClassB-certified machine.andM;The steep price is probably the only reason not to buy the 7550A.andP;  Butconsidering its convenience, high-quality output, and fast plotting speed,the 7550A is more than a fair value.andP;  It's the best desktop plotter we'veseen.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
