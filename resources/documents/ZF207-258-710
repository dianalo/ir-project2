 More software is now available for the DEC VAX andHewlett-Packard machines, for instance.andM;Meanwhile, market leaders such as Computer Associates, McCormack andamp; Dodge andGlobal Software have been busy stretching the functionality of their packagesacross hardware platforms.andP;  But actual heterogeneous integration of thefinancial packages, in which software on a DEC VAX may keep in synch with itssister package on an IBM host, is only beginning to become available.andM;Those applications are for the future.andP;  Today, it appears to be beyonddispute that most organizations--even if they have the creativetalent--cannot afford the time to develop and maintain financial applicationssoftware at the level of effectiveness provided by the independent softwarefirms.andM;Considering the pace of technological change and the cost of Randamp;D, corporatemanagers concede that little is gained by pouring money into in-houseapplications development instead of purchasing off-the-shelf packages.andM;&quot;There's no need to reinvent the wheel,&quot; says David Tilley, accountingsystems supervisor for Nova Group of Alberta, Canada, a $10 billion energycompany.andP;  &quot;The more integrated, end-user controlled packages I could buycompatible with our feeder system, the happier I would be.&quot;andM;Large or small, companies are saying they can use their internal MIS peoplemore cost-effectively for custom software development where standardizedtools and systems are not available.andP;  Companies also want in-house MIS tosupport applications to ensure that systems are fully productive.andM;VENDORS CONSTANTLY TESTEDandM;Concerns about product reliability and support are easily put to rest by thefact that the vendors are constantly tested in a competitive marketplace thatdemands continuous accountability.andP;  The success of the vendor is no smallindication of the quality of the product.andM;Available market research shows that commercially supplied packages have beensteadily gaining in share on in-house generated financial software forseveral years.andP;  According to Computer Intelligence, La Jolla, Calif., 59% ofIBM mainframe sites now use commercially supplied financial applications.andO;(See graphic.)andM;Computer Intelligence makes the following predictions for 1989:andM;* the number of automated systems will increase relative to non-automatedsystems;andM;* the percentage share of the whole claimed by commercial packages willincrease; andandM;* the ratio of commercial packages to in-house financial systems will grow infavor of the packaged products.andM;Dave Lowry, president of Data Design Associates, Sunnyvale, Calif., has seenthese developments evolve over the past 16 years.andP;  In his view, it is noaccident that financial applications packages are more frequently chosen overin-house applications programs.andM;Lowry says the demand for commercial packages during the past three or fouryears is due to the maturity of computer and communicationstechnology--especially at the micro level.andM;A new wave of computer-literate or, at least computer-sensitive, managerscould appreciate the benefits of dependable, fully supported financialpackages that could do comprehensive cross-functional inquiry and reportingby simple commands from an end user at a PC or intelligent workstation.andO;These people, in cooperation with their systems specialists, influenceautomation decisions.andM;The availability of flexible applications processing with &quot;seamless&quot;portability across different operating environments and versatile,user-friendly report-writing programs that extracted, summarized andselectively distributed key information in consolidated format was timelynews.andM;Some companies, at considerable risk of culture shock, embraced the conceptof integrated financial systems in the mid- to late-1970s.andP;  Avondale Mills ofSylacauga, Ala., is an example.andM;Hollis Ezell, assistant controller at Avondale Mills, recounts that thedecision in 1978 to upgrade the obsolescent accounting system was at firstunfavorably greeted by members of the financial staff who werepsychologically unprepared to make the adaptation.andM;&quot;That's history now,&quot; he says.andP;  Installation of the then SoftwareInternational general ledger mainframe package (called CA-General Ledgersince 1986) created an environment in which the necessity to adapt generatedthe will to adapt.andM;Today, with many of the financial managers of 1978 still aboard, &quot;the notionthat an accountant can be effective on the computer is taken for granted,&quot;Ezell says.andM;Even before integrated financial software packages were operating onmainframes, they were well established in the Digital Equipment Corp. VAXennvironment, says Dennis Vohs, chairman and CEO of Ross Systems Inc., PaloAlto, Calif.andM;The VAX system, with integrated architecture built-in, &quot;provided a ready-madeenvironment for integrated transaction processing and intra-corporatereporting,&quot; Vohs asserted.andM;Because system components were internally compatible, portability for thecompany's Renaissance financial products was not an issue.andP;  There was no needfor expensive additional programming or special interfaces to establishinternal communication, he adds.andM;Nutri/System Inc., Willow Grove, Pa., operators and franchisers of aweight-loss system, installed Ross Systems' general ledger, accounts payableand manager report writing products in September 1987.andM;Cindy Shore, accounting operations systems liaison, explained that the newlyreorganized company sought to integrtae and internalize accounting functionswhich had grown unwieldy under previous corporate management.andM;At the same time, it wanted a system which provided a flexible (vs.andO;hierarchical) chart of accounts and could readily download analytical datafor PC-based budgeting and forecasting via Lotus or other spreadsheetprograms, and offer some applications flexibility besides.andM;Combining the VAX-compatible Cullinet Distribution Management System orderentry and accounts receivable system with the Ross software in a VAX 8315 and8530 cluster environment created an interactive accounting system thatenabled the company to reduce monthly reporting time by a full week.andM;The system now services 175 company-owned centers plus 800 franchises with anaccounting staff comprising fewer than a dozen professional-level employeesand a financial analysis staff of only six.andM;For a company that generates $400 million per year, Shore says &quot;the systemhas done a very good job.&quot;andP;  Processing time is comparatively long, she says.andO;DEC VMS version 5.0 is being implemented now.andM;But when the Ross version 5.0 &quot;goes online in the fall, the slowness shouldbe corrected,&quot; she said.andP;  The new version is expected to reduce transactionprocedures that now take 3-1/2 hours to 40 minutes.andM;Similar reactions are reported by a wide range of users with differentobjectives, needs and budgets.andM;Aristech Chemical Corp., Pittsburgh, runs Ross Systems' general ledger andfixed assets packages on a VAX 8700.andM;Cheryl Hayes, senior applications analyst, said that price was not a primaryconsideration.andP;  &quot;More important were common architecture, user friendliness,performance reliability and applications expandability.&quot;andM;The system also had to talk to existing accounts payable and purchasingsystems.andP;  Because of information deficiencies in the software--for instance,failure to provide for freight on board charges and to cross-referencepurchase order numbers with the company's vendor codes--we were obliged todevelop additional reports external to the system to accommodate our payablesrequirements, she said.andM;But the problem was solved and, says Hayes, &quot;the system generally fits ourspecifications.candM;Hayes foresees a continuing need for developmental work to strengthen theconnections between accounts payable, purchasing and the control requirementsof a huge catalog of inventory stores.andM;GROWING TOO FASTandM;Expansion and integration of the financial system became an urgent priorityat Reebok International, Canton, Mass., as the athletic footwear companyexperienced uncommonly rapid growth during 1985-87.andM;Existing in-house software &quot;was just inadequate,&quot; explained MIS businessapplications director George Murphy.andP;  The company wanted state-of-the-artintegration with fourth-generation languages and a highly flexibleapplications-building capability for future expansion, all readilyinstallable on an IBM 3090 mainframe.andM;Equally important, the new software was expected to accommodate theprogramming in place.andM;Reviewing a selection of options, Reebok bought McCormack and Dodge'sMillennium family of general ledger, accounts receivable, accounts payableand fixed assets packages along with Mandamp;D's systems development tool and PClink.andM;The company does over 100,000 receivable transactions a month, Murphyestimates.andP;  Every night they batch process AR entries and cash receipts at5:30 p.m., and by 8:00 p.m.andP;  the job is finished.andM;Using applicable Mandamp;D report writers for monthly general ledger, AR, balancesheet, special credit and other reports, &quot;there is no problem getting them inon time.&quot;andM;Budgeting and financial modeling requirements are also well met, Murphy says.andO;The system effectively feeds the analytical staff via Lotus and otheranalytical software.andM;Continuous maintenance is the key to the ongoing reliability of the system.andO;To ensure consistent performance, Murphy uses a staff of sixspecialists--three accountants and three MIS people--for training, problemassistance and applications development.andM;Stephen Morse, supervisor of general ledger operations, Portland GeneralElectric, Portland, Ore., said his utility company set out in 1981 toestablish an integrated management information system with &quot;as much built-inflexibility as we could achieve.&quot;andM;Portland GE aimed for a system that would set up summary accounts to tiebudgeting to accounting.andP;  They also wanted a hierarchical database that couldtie labor, materials purchasing and other cost-related data to accountspayable and do project tracking as well.andM;A product advisory committee selected Software International's general ledgerproduct (now CA-General Ledger) which went online in 1982.andM;The company subsequently added as a satellite an SAS statistical tool foreasier report formatting and more efficient analytical processing.andP;  Toenhance file access for budgeting applications, CA's Model Tool 204 databasemanagement system was acquired, providing bridges to utilities and reportwriters.andP;  &quot;At present,&quot; says Morse, &quot;we've got the right tools for the job.&quot;andM;Margaret LaSenna, financial systems manager at CSX Corp., Jacksonville, Fla.,andO;assesses Data Design Associates' (DDA) packages in similar terms.andP;  Her officeoperates primarily as a service group to the railroad.andM;REPLACING HYBRIDSandM;In June 1986, her department requested proposals for new financial productsthat would replace and upgrade the &quot;hybrid&quot; accounting system in place.andO;Selection criteria included ease of data entry and the look and functionalefficiency of the screen for accounts payable requirements.andM;For general ledger, the reporting format, hierarchy of account definitionsand the flexibility of the structure were key criteria.andP;  PC connectivity,user friendliness and ease of installation were also considered along withcompatibility with the IBM 3090 MVS-XA mainframe environment.andM;DDA's accounts payable and general ledger systems were up in January 1987,three months after the contract was confirmed.andP;  A year later, the companypurchased DDA's fixed assets package, and in January of this year theyinstalled DDA's project accounting product.andM;Access to general ledger for budgetary analysis and forecasting was a majorpriority readily solved by micro-mainframe data links.andP;  Job set-up andprocessing were rated as only fairly efficient.andP;  But the overall evaluationwas &quot;very satisfactory.&quot;andM;Coda Integrated Accounting System (IAS) is a relative newcomer to the DEC VAXenvironment in the U.S.andP;  Coda Inc., the U.S.andP;  sponsor, is a subsidiary of theBritish software firm established in 1979.andM;IAS features a single, online transactional database for general ledger, APand AR, which incorporates sales and purchasing in the general ledger andprovides for flexible subledger development.andP;  The system permits immediateand automatic intra-company cross-ledger updating and balancing.andM;Another built-in feature provides simultaneous single-transaction processingin up to five different currencies at user-determined conversion rates foruse by firms that deal in foreign currencies.andM;Nedlloyd Lines USA Corp., Atlanta, is the North American branch of a $2billion multinational Dutch conglomerate.andP;  Bookings from hundreds of agentsmust be reported daily and summaries transmitted in realtime to headquartersin Rotterdam for worldwide communication.andM;Keith Jacobsen, financial vice president, reported that when the companymoved into its Atlanta offices at the end of 1987 it needed new receivables,payables and payroll systems.andP;  It chose IAS because its online integratedaccounting features afforded them the ability to post immediately--and audit.andM;A second attraction was the intracompany module enabling the North Americanbranch to make bookings in other parts of the world and report transactionsinteractively between Rotterdam and the Hong Kong branch.andM;The currency conversion facility was another appealing factor.andP;  And since aDEC VAX system was already in place, IAS' compatibility presented an addedincentive.andP;  The modularity of older packages supplied by other vendors wasnot ideal for us,&quot; Jacobsen said.andM;But he also preferred a modification in Coda's receivables system.andP;  IAS postsreceivables by invoice number, he explained.andP;  Nedlloyd posts by otherreferences, including operations media, which forced them to develop aspecial interface that will allow the hardware to communicate betweenoperations and accounting.andM;Outside of that, says Jacobsen, &quot;we've been getting some good results.&quot;andM;Leeson Electric Co., Grafton, Wis., was still using applications softwarefrom the 1960s and '70s with a Burroughs 2900 mainframe through the mid-'80s.andM;Frank Poja, financial vice president, says that in 1986 &quot;we were forced toupdate hardware and software to keep up with growth requirements.&quot;andM;A 14-member project development committee, after investigation of a varietyof vendors, decided in favor of the Business Planning and Control System(BPCS) put out by System Software Associates, based in Chicago.andP;  It wasinstalled in an IBM System 38 and so far has been used for accountingapplications and not for financial planning.andM;It took two months of &quot;trial by force&quot; to orient the accounting department tothe new system, says Poja.andP;  But the adjustment was made and every member ofthe department recognized the advantage.andM;With the old Burroughs-based system, month-end sales accounting typicallyclosed seven days late.andP;  The current system closes sales the next day.andO;Payables take a little longer to close, but present closing times still beatwhat the old system could do.andP;  Improvements have also been made in billingtime.andM;Poja adds that he saves valuable time by querying cost accounting online.andP;  Hecan also transfer cash electronically from one bucket to another for specialLIFO reports.andM;For accounts payable, the system brings component items, such as materialscosts, articles and quantities received, purchase orders and inventoryreporting, under closer control and in tighter balance compared to previousmanual and paper-based methods.andM;Online access to current and historical credit information permits theaccounting staff to conduct telephone conversations regarding credit withcustomers and make immediate decisions while looking at the details on thescreen.andM;The general ledger system offers many benefits previously unavailable to theaccounting department.andP;  Poja points out that the ability to do onlineinquiries for specified periods across the entire GL file system is a majoradvantage, saving untold amounts of research time.andP;  Real-time access to orderentry, billing and inventory files can be very useful.andP;  For example,inventory costing in previous batch mode, edited, formerly took three weeks.andO;&quot;Now it's done in a week.&quot;andM;Important developments have taken place in financial software design andproduct offerings during the past 12 months.andM;A partial list would have to include Data Design Associates' release ofEqqual.andP;  It is an ultra-flexible software system architecture designed tosupport via PC controls all customer financial software on a user-determineddistributed processing basis within IBM's unfolding Systems ApplicationArchitecture.andM;Computer Associates introduced Masterpiece 2.0, a rival architectural systemthat offers &quot;the tools, facilities, flexibility and ease of use&quot; to meet therequirements of both data processing and end-user departments in IBMmainframe, System 3X and DEC VAX environments.andP;  The system is built on&quot;fifth-generation&quot; Masterpiece Programming Language which, through aconversion process, generates Cobol and directs it to specific operatingsystems and hardware.andM;Ross Systems' Renaissance version 5.0 offers improvements in performance.andO;Coda's new spreadsheet software promises to enhance the productivity of itsaccounting package.andP;  Global Software's new Deduction Management System isdesigned to achieve substantial reductions in accounts receivable dollarstied up in disputed invoices or unresolved deductions claimed by customers.andM;The magnitude of these and doubtless other design projects in the worksconfirms the increasing role that packaged software will play in corporatefinancial management.andP;  They also presage an era of greater integrationbetween financial management and the strategic needs of manufacturing,marketing, personnel administration and other major corporate constituents.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
