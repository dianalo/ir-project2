To prohibit analysts fromowning stocks they cover, he says, &quot;would be verydisadvantageous in your ability to hold analysts.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Brokerage-house officials vigorously defend the practice.Many of them say investors should be glad to see analysts&quot;put their money where their mouth is.&quot; Besides, brokeragefirms say they have a host of safeguards to keep analystsfrom &quot;front running&quot; their own recommendations -- buying astock and then touting it to the public.   But the practice of analysts owning stocks raises toughethical questions. Some are dramatized in a civil complaintby the Securities and Exchange Commission pending in U.S.district court in Manhattan against Peter Butler, an analystwith First Boston; such an SEC action against a securitiesanalyst is rare. Mr. Butler, a well-known chemical industryanalyst, has placed second in his industry for two yearsrunning in Institutional Investor magazine's annual rankingof Wall Street securities analysts.   In the 1990 complaint, now grinding its way through thepre-trial process, the SEC alleges that Mr. Butler -- then achemical analyst with PaineWebber -- owned Memory Metalsstock in 1985 and 1986 and tried to drive up its price inviolation of securities-fraud statutes.   Mr. Butler's attorney, Warren Colodner, says that Mr.Butler denies any wrongdoing. He declines to say when Mr.Butler bought and sold Memory Metals shares. &quot;The informationhas to be seen in the full context,&quot; Mr. Colodner says. &quot;Whenall the facts come to light, Peter is confident that it willbe shown that he did not act improperly.&quot;   The SEC alleges in its complaint that Mr. Butlerrecommended Memory Metals to various people, includingPaineWebber brokers who purchased it for clients. The SECsays Mr. Butler told people it &quot;was the stock that they wouldretire on&quot; and that the price was likely to reach 200 withinfive years. The analyst made these and other statements while&quot;knowing or reckless in not knowing that such statements werematerially false or misleading,&quot; the SEC says.   Memory Metals said it was developing copper alloys thatquickly reverted to their original shape when heated. Thestock reached a 1986 high of 16 5/8; by the end of the yearit was below 4. Recently, trading under the new name Memry,it was quoted at 37.5 cents.   The SEC complaint says Mr. Butler organized a shortsqueeze to drive the stock price up (short sellers bet on astock's declining). The complaint also says that Mr. Butlerthreatened to withhold future advice from anyone who soldMemory Metals stock, that he requested or expected to receive&quot;compensation from Memory Metals,&quot; and that he sold sharesfrom his own account while continuing to recommend to otherpeople that they buy the stock. The SEC complaint doesn'tspecify how many shares of Memory Metals Mr. Butler owned orprovide any details of his trading.   Mr. Colodner, the attorney, says that &quot;Peter Butler neverissued a research report on this stock.&quot; His disputed conductinvolved only oral statements, and other parties in theconversations knew that Mr. Butler owned Memory Metals stock,the lawyer says. The SEC contends that Mr. Butler's commentswere recommendations, even if they weren't written reports.   A month ago, SEC officials took a deposition in Dallasfrom Tom Barton, a partner of the well-known short sellersFeshbach Brothers. Mr. Barton told the SEC in his depositionthat he furnished Mr. Butler in the summer of 1986 with whatMr. Barton said was clear evidence that specific contractsMemory Metals claimed to have were nonexistent.   Memory Metals' stock plunged in the autumn of 1986 afterthe company &quot;clarified&quot; its previous announcements aboutcontracts with larger concerns.   Mr. Colodner says that he hasn't yet had a chance tocross-examine Mr. Barton and declined to comment on thedeposition.   Cases like that of Mr. Butler could spur some Wall Streetfirms to review their policies on analysts' owning stocks. Asurvey of eight brokerage firms shows that policies vary.   Most firms require prior approval of all analysts'personal trades, both by the research department and thecompliance department. At Raymond James, prior approval isn'trequired, but analysts must report their trades within 24hours and fill out a disclosure form on why they bought orsold.   All eight brokerage firms allow analysts to own the stocksthey follow, though usually an analyst must wait at least twodays after recommending a stock before buying it. ShearsonLehman Brothers' waiting period is 15 days.   At some firms, such as Salomon Brothers and First Boston,officials say that it's fairly rare for analysts to ownstocks they cover. &quot;We don't get that many proposals fromanalysts to trade in stocks they cover, and of the proposalswe get, a large percentage are turned down,&quot; says RobertDenham, Salomon's chief legal counsel. Salomon, ShearsonLehman and some other firms also require analysts to hold forat least six months any stock they cover.   But at most brokerage firms, stock ownership by analystsis routine. The typical Smith Barney analyst buys or sells astock about &quot;once a month on average,&quot; says John Hoffman, thefirm's associate research director. But &quot;there are a handfulof guys who trade a lot.&quot; He says the firm discourages heavytrading, because &quot;we don't want them to spend all their timewatching their Quotron.&quot; This month, the firm plans toincrease the minimum time analysts are required to hold astock to six months from three, if the stock is in anindustry they follow.   Raymond James says that if an analyst owns a stock, itwould make him or her sell it before initiating coverage witha &quot;buy&quot; recommendation. Another firm, which declined to beidentified, says it won't allow initiation of coverage, evenwith a &quot;hold&quot; recommendation, if the analyst owns the stock.The very fact of &quot;coverage carries some cachet,&quot; says a firmofficial.   But six other firms -- Dean Witter, First Boston, KidderPeabody, Salomon, Shearson and Smith Barney -- say they mightallow an analyst to initiate coverage of a stock he owns,provided various safeguards are observed and the holding isof long standing. &quot;If there were a couple of months delay&quot;between the analysts' purchase and his recommendation, &quot;thatwould be fine,&quot; says Dean Witter's Mr. Korman. Others say theminimum holding period would be six months to a year.   Peter Anker, research director at First Boston, offers anexample. A brokerage firm might recruit a paper industryexecutive as an analyst. The executive may have longstandingholdings in his or her paper company. In Mr. Anker's view, itwould be unfair to require divestiture and foolish to preventthe person from covering his or her former employer.   Perhaps the most ticklish issue is what happens if ananalyst wants to sell a stock while maintaining a &quot;buy&quot;rating on it. That obviously calls for safeguards, as theanalyst has a financial incentive to keep the price up untilhe or she has finished selling.   Seven of the eight firms allow such sales if the analystassures them in writing that the company's outlook hasn'tchanged, and the sale is motivated by a personal need. Payingfor a house, taxes or medical bills will usually suffice as areason.   &quot;If they sell and the stock collapses, it's going to comeout of their hide one way or another,&quot; says Dean Witter's Mr.Korman.   &quot;It's not unheard of to reverse {cancel} a trade&quot; if acompany announces an adverse development soon after ananalyst sells, says John M. Liftin, general counsel forKidder Peabody.   One research director says that when analysts need money,he tells them to sell stocks they don't cover, or don't rateas buys. If an analyst's only holding is a buyrated stock,and the analyst's mother needs an operation, he might allowsale of as much as half the position. Beyond that, he says,the mother will have to &quot;go to a cheaper hospital.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
