Panguitch officials say the town's 1,400 residents have had itup to their noses, prompting authorities to offer a $5-a-skunkreward to encourage the trapping and destruction of the animals.   ``It's a whole stinking problem,'' quipped City Manager BruceFullmer. ``This is a farming community, and the skunks come out ofthe fields and into the community once in a while.''   Fullmer said that in the past, this southwestern Utah towncontracted with resident Van Barney _ ``a pretty good man forhandling skunks'' _ to get rid of the animals, but he died lastyear.   The reward is aimed at enticing two animal control officers totake up the task, he said.   Officials won't turn down residents who find a skunk or twounder a shed or an old house. But officials aren't trying toencourage residents to go out and gather skins and then turn themin for the reward, Fullmer said.</TEXT></DOC>
