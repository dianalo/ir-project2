The A-11 gene was identified by a cDNA that hydridizes to a3.2-kb EcoR1 fragment of genomic DNA on the long arm of the human X chromosome.A-11 transcripts are normally present in fibroblasts but not in B- orT-lymphoblasts. However, A-11 transcription was activated in four of11 independent, gamma ray-induced B-lymphoblastoid HLA antigen-loss mutants.Cell hybrids with a human fibroblast-derived active X contained A-11transcripts but hybrids carrying the human inactive X did not. Azacytidine,a potent inhibitor of DNA methylation, readily reactivated the A-11 locuson the inactive X in hybrid cells, indicating that differential methylationis likely to be involved in the single-active-X control of A-11 transcriptionin fibroblasts. Failure of cells to remethylate DNA synthesized to repairgamma ray-induced damage may also have resulted in the activation ofA-11 transcription among the lymphoblastoid mutants. The A-11 locus providesan opportunity to study the relationship between two types of transcriptionalregulation of a gene.</TEXT></DOC>
