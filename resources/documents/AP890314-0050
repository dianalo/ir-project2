(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An experiment that could be a precursor tospace colonization was proclaimed a ``huge success'' after a marinebiologist emerged from five days of isolation in a tiny world withina world.   Abigail Alling said the 23-square-foot greenhouse-like modulethat had cut her off from the rest of Earth's environment sinceWednesday was ``truly paradise.''   ``The three aspects of science _ the experiment, the experimenterand the experience _ became a unity,'' Ms. Alling said Monday as sheemerged from the module.   ``What surprised me was how easy and relaxed the whole thingwas,'' said Ms. Alling, 29.   ``It's very simple to say how we feel about this,'' said CarlHodges, director of the University of Arizona Environmental Researchlaboratory. ``It's a huge success. I'm ecstatic.''   The experiment was part of a privately funded, $30 millionresearch project designed to see whether human beings can exist inan enclosed world, possibly as a precursor to space colonization.Four men and four women are scheduled to enter the 2{-acre``Biosphere II'' structure in September 1990 for a two-year stay.   In the experiments, plants and organisms are used to purify theair and water and to replenish the oxygen supply, according toMargaret Augustine, the project director.   Food is grown, harvested and prepared inside the biosphere, andwastes are biologically treated and recycled for fertilizer, shesaid.   Ms. Alling, a Yale University-trained marine-mammal scientist,said she enjoyed her stay in the enclosure. She said she busiedherself by harvesting and cooking her own food and working on hercontribution to Biosphere II, which will include a 35-foot-deep,1-million-gallon ``ocean'' as one of its seven seperateenvironmental systems.   The test module is a self-contained greenhouse about the size ofa single-car garage. It is topped with a futuristic steel-and-glasscanopy rising to a height of 20 feet.   Lack of room forced the omission of the chicken, fish and goatsthat will be included in Biosphere II, but Ms. Alling was able tochoose from a variety of fruits and vegetables for her diet of 2,500calories a day.   She stayed in touch with the outside world through a telephoneand computer.   Two more weeks of experiments will be conducted on the testmodule but without a human occupant.   Even after the two-year test is completed in Biosphere II, Hodgessaid, the project will be far from complete.   ``When we close for two years, that's just another step,'' hesaid. ``Biosphere II is designed to last 100 years.''   The Biosphere II project is located on the 2,500-acre Sun Spaceranch, located near Oracle, a small town at the foot of the Catalinamountains about 30 miles north of Tucson.   The ranch is owned by Space Biospheres Ventures, a for-profitresearch company financed largely by Texas oilman Edward P. Bass.   If the project succeeds, Space Biospheres Ventures plans tomarket versions of the biosphere to governments and researchersstudying such endeavors as preservation of endangered species orspace colonization.</TEXT></DOC>
