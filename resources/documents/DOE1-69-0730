Recent demands target removal of other inorganic impurities whichdeactivate catalysts and contaminate finish products. The specific demandor performance need is usually apparent and easily quantified. This paperfocuses on methods to achieve these demands through process optimization,chemical treatment, and employing an integrated process approach to desalting.</TEXT></DOC>
