An army communique early Monday said several Palestinians werearrested and soldiers were sweeping the area around Jericho, sevenmiles east of Jerusalem. A curfew was imposed on the biblical townof 6,000.   Earlier, a Palestinian was killed and 21 others wounded inclashes between Israeli soldiers and Arab demonstrators in the WestBank and occupied Gaza Strip.   The deaths raised the toll to 305 Palestinians and 10 Israeliskilled in the Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. Thebus attack caused the largest Israeli loss of life in a singleincident since the violence began Dec. 8.   The red-and-white bus was stopped by a barricade of stones onJericho's outskirts, Israel radio said. Palestinians then hurledfive firebombs at the bus, which was carrying about 20 people, mostcivilians.   The bus was traveling from Tiberius on the Sea of Galilee toJerusalem when it was halted about 8:15 p.m., the army said.Witnesses said it was engulfed in fire before the woman and herchildren, sitting in the rear, could be rescued.   The army said the dead were from Tiberius. News reports said twoof the children were infants.   The army said five others were wounded, but Israel radio and thenational news agency Itim said 11 Israelis were killed or wounded.   The deaths, the worst shedding of Israeli blood since thePalestinian uprising began 10 months ago, came two days beforeTuesday's Parliament elections.   It could swing undecided votes to the right-wing Likud bloc ofPrime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, who has advocated a tougher line ondealing with the unrest.   ``The murderous and criminal act is testimony to the trendtowards more extremism on the part of the aggressors whose onedesire is to kill and burn as many Jews as possible,'' Itim quotedShamir as saying.   Itim quoted Foreign Minister and Labor Party leader ShimonPeres, his election rival, as saying that such attacks unite thenation into ``one family.''   ``Neither terrorism nor violence will determine our path. Wewill determine our path,'' he said. ``Deeds such as tonight's tearat the heart and provide nothing in the way of hope or a solution.''   Israel radio broadcast an interview with a soldier aboard thebus it identified only as Sgt. Ron, 21.   ``I heard the sounds of a woman. I approached her, and grabbedher with one hand. I said, `Come out with me.' She absolutelyrefused,'' said the soldier.   ``She said, `But I have a baby, what about the baby.' After afew seconds, I realized that if I remained one more second (I wouldbe killed). ... I escaped with the last bit of energy.''   Itim said the soldier, who suffered a burn on his ear, also wasunable to rescue another infant.   Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron rushed to the site, andsoldiers combed nearby fields and citrus groves. Helicopters tookthe wounded to hospitals, where some were reported in seriouscondition.   Extra soldiers have been deployed throughout the territories forfear the parliamentary elections would bring even more violence.   Underground Palestinian leaders called a general strike Tuesdayto coincide with the elections, and they joined Moslemfundamentalists urging another strike Wednesday.   An army spokesman said a Palestinian teen-ager died whensoldiers fired plastic bullets on youths demonstrating in the WestBank Christian village of Beit Sahur, the site of the fields wherethe Bible says shepherds first learned of the birth of Jesus.   Village residents said Iyad Bishara Abu Sada, 18, was shot inthe chest with a plastic bullet and died instantly. A secondPalestinian was reported shot in the right arm.   Rioters set fires, and troops declared the village a closedmilitary area and ordered reporters out.   Palestinians took to the streets of Bethlehem to protest thedeath. Women marched and chanted ``PLO, PLO, Israel no,'' andtroops ordered rock blockades cleared from roads.   In the Gaza Strip, 18 Palestinians ranging in age from 12 to 70were shot by soldiers, hospital officials said. The army said ithad reports of six woundings in the Gaza Strip and was checking theother reports.   Two Palestinians aged 12 and 14 were wounded when Israeli troopsfired on stone-throwers in the village of Salem near Nablus, theWest Bank's largest city, Arab reporters said. They said the12-year-old was shot in the head.   Palestinians also said they found the body of a young Arab, shotin the head, in a water barrel Sunday in the West Bank village ofRujib. Soldiers opened fire there to put down rioting a day earlierand wounded at least six Palestinians. The army said it wasinvestigating.   Also Sunday, a military spokesman said Israeli troops insouthern Lebanon shot and killed a Lebanese man in the mistakenbelief he was a guerrilla.   Israel radio said the dead man had been hunting foxes at nightwith a companion when he was shot Friday in Majdal Zoun.
