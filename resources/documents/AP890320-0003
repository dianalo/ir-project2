Three journalists also were killed.   The alliance, known as Arena, said its candidate gained more than50 percent of the vote.   That would be enough to avoid a runoff election next monthagainst the incumbent Christian Democrats.   ``We are sure and we proclaim oursevles the victors,'' RobertoD'Aubuisson, founder of Arena, told a news conference.   Arena presidential candidate Alfredo Cristiani said the party hadresults from 75 percent of the polling places and he was assured ofvictory.   Election authorities said preliminary officials results wereexpected Monday.   A boycott by leftist rebels and scattered gun battles betweenguerrillas and troops trimmed the voter turnout.   Six soldiers and 23 guerrillas were killed in battles as therebels tried to disrupt the voting, according to Col. Emilio Ponce,chief of the joint chiefs of staff.   Two Salvadoran journalists and a Dutch television cameraman alsowere killed _ one during clash at a rebel-held town and the othersat military checkpoints.   Christian Democratic candidate Fidel Chavez Mena had said heexpected to do better in the countryside than in the capital, butSan Salvador's Channel 12 television station said Cristiani wasrunning strongly enough to win a clear majority.   The Christian Democrat headquarters was virtually deserted Sundaynight and the party provided no results.   ``We have the 50 percent that is needed to win and I can assureyou there will be no second round,'' said D'Aubuisson. ``I am proudto have been able to carry such a good and capable man as FreddyCristiani to the presidency.''   Critics claim Arena is still controlled by D'Aubuisson, a retiredarmy major who has been accused of having links with rightist deathsquads. D'Aubuisson has repeatedly denied the allegations.   Polls closed at 5 p.m. (6 p.m. EST). There was no official wordon turnout, but a spot check by The Associated Press at severalpolling places in San Salvador showed between 55 and 65 percent ofthose registered had cast ballots.   Ana Guadalupe Martinez, a rebel spokeswoman in Mexico City, saidenough people had stayed away from the polls to prove that noelection could be held without participation by the guerrillas'Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.   She said no polling places or voters had been attacked, as theguerrillas had pledged, but rebel assaults on governmentinstallations prevented the army from taking voters to the polls.   The guerrillas had imposed a transport ban and sabotagedtelephone lines and electricity, which cut or restricted power to 80percent of the country.   Roman Catholic churches were crowded with Palm Sunday worshipersand by midday there were long lines of voters at polling stations inSan Salvador. Turnout was light in many smaller towns.   ``With these problems it's better to stay home,'' said JoseCarlos Ortiz, 23. He spoke in front of his home in the capital asguerrillas retreated from an assault on a military post three blocksaway.   Sporadic rifle fire echoed from the slope of the Guazapa volcano,a guerrilla stronghold north of San Salvador, as troops foughtinsurgents in the 9-year-old war that has claimed an estimated70,000 lives.   There were seven presidential candidates and the three major oneswere Cristiani, Chavez Mena and Guillermo Ungo of the leftistDemocratic Convergence.   Christiani and Chavez Mena were the only contenders with a chanceto win.   Christian Democrat President Jose Napoleon Duarte's five-yearterm ends June 1. Duarte, barred by law from running forre-election, is Washington's staunchest ally in Central America. Heis dying of liver cancer.   Cristiani has vowed to follow free-market policies and reducestate intervention in the eonomy. His party promised to step up thewar if the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National LiberationFront do not agree to lay down their arms.   Cristiani voted Sunday morning in San Salvador and told a groupof his supporters, ``I hope the United States realizes that(Salvadorans) want democracy, with this effort they're making tovote. We don't want any more bombs.''   Chavez Mena is a lawyer and heads the Christian Democrats'conservative wing. He struggled against opposition charges ofcorruption in the government and inability of the ChristianDemocrats to deal with the economy and the civil war.   Leaders of the Democratic Convergence maintain formal links withthe guerrillas. This is the first election since 1977 in whichsocialist candidates have competed.   About 1.83 million people out of a population of 5 million wereeligible to vote. Polls opened at 7 a.m. in 243 of the country's 262municipalities and closed at 5 p.m.   Nineteen towns in the north did not set up voting stationsbecause election officials deemed those rebel-held zones toodangerous.   In San Sebastian, 30 miles east of the capital, turnout was light.   ``The people are frightened,'' said William Doherty of theAmerican AFL-CIO. ``There is no question that the intimidation bythe (guerrillas) is working.''   Doherty is one of 21 congressmen, state politicians and privatecitizens named by the White House to be official election observers.He said turnout Sunday was ``far less'' than during three previouselections he attended this decade.   Cornel Lagrouw, a cameraman for Dutch national television, waskilled as army troops moved to oust guerrillas occupying the easterntown of San Francisco Javier, said Bill Gentile, a U.S. photographerfor Newsweek.   Lagrouw was part of a group of six journalists and two driverswho were in the town. The others dragged him away and fled in twocars, but they came under repeated helicopter fire despite pressmarkings and white flags on the vehicles, Gentile said.   The military said it had no immediate information on the report.   Two Salvadoran journalists were killed and another seriouslywounded when security forces fired on their vehicles. The armedforces said the vehicles failed to heed orders to stop at roadblocks.   In the March 1988 elections for the National Assembly, Arena won32 seats, the Christian Democrats 23 and the National ConciliationParty six. But a group called the Authentic Christian Movement splitfrom the Christian Democrats, taking 16 seats from Duarte's faction.The next legislative elections are set for March 1991.</TEXT></DOC>
