The White House, which had been widely expected to end thepenalties this month, received a State Department report lastweek finding that Pretoria's white-minority government hascomplied with five conditions set in the U.S. sanctionslegislation. Under the law, if the requirements have beenmet, Mr. Bush would issue an executive order and sanctionswould be lifted immediately.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's not a question of exercising a lot of judgment,&quot; Mr.Bush said, &quot;it's a question of determining whether these fiveconditions have been met.&quot; At a joint news conference lastnight with Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, thepresident said he sees no reason to avoid using whatdiscretion he does have to keep the sanctions in place.   &quot;I've never been enthusiastic about sanctions in the firstplace, if you want to know the truth,&quot; he said, adding thatSouth Africa's leadership has &quot;done things that none of uswould have dreamed possible in effecting and moving towardchange and freedom.&quot;   Yesterday, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, &quot;Ido expect a decision fairly soon . . . within the next day ortwo.&quot;   Some congressional Democrats and pro-sanctions advocatesassert that removing the penalties now is a mistake. Theyargue that South Africa hasn't yet fully fulfilled the law'srequirements and that, in any case, pressure on Pretoria isstill needed to ensure that it completely dismantlesapartheid and establishes a multiracial democracy in SouthAfrica.   &quot;I think it would be premature for President Bush to liftthe sanctions against South Africa,&quot; said Rep. Mervyn Dymally(D., Calif.), chairman of the House foreign affairssubcommittee on Africa. &quot;Two major issues of concern to blackSouth Africans, land reform and majority rule, haven't yetbeen resolved.&quot;   The National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople, meeting this week in Houston, is expected to approvea resolution today opposing the lifting of sanctions.Benjamin Hooks, NAACP executive director, contended thatremoving the penalties would be &quot;absolutely irresponsible&quot;and said that &quot;they should be kept in place&quot; until &quot;we arefurther than we are now.&quot;   Nevertheless, it isn't likely that pro-sanctions lawmakerswill be able to block Mr. Bush's action. Although theadministration has been consulting with legislators for thelast few weeks, the White House isn't required to notifyCongress formally before it lifts the sanctions. Moreover,some pro-sanctions Democrats, including Mr. Dymally, concedethat they probably don't have the votes to reimpose thesanctions on South Africa.   Administration officials as well as lawmakers who supportthe sanctions note that under other U.S. laws somerestrictions would remain in place. For example, the U.S. isrequired to vote against International Monetary Loans toSouth Africa, is prohibited from making any sales to itsmilitary or police, and can't support most loans from theExport-Import Bank. The U.S. also complies with a UnitedNations arms embargo of South Africa.   With the sanctions about to be removed, South Africa'sambassador to the U.S., Harry Schwarz, has begun urgingCongress to continue its involvement in South Africa byhelping to bolster its economy and promote democracy. &quot;Idon't want the U.S. to wash its hands of South Africa afterapartheid goes,&quot; he said during a recent interview.   In a study released in May, the Investor ResponsibilityResearch Center Inc., a private group, said that SouthAfrica's economy is 20% to 35% smaller than it would havebeen without the restrictions imposed over the years byinternational sanctions.   According to the 1986 sanctions bill, South Africa wasrequired to release all political prisoners, repeal its stateof emergency, legalize all political parties, repeal twomajor apartheid laws, and agree to hold &quot;good faith&quot;negotiations with black leaders.   Although Democrats assert that Pretoria hasn't fully metseveral of the conditions, the strongest contention likelywill be over the issue of political prisoners. Theadministration said that the internationally recognizeddefinition includes prisoners &quot;persecuted for their politicalbeliefs&quot; and that this excludes those jailed for violentcrimes. Others use a broader definition, saying that somepolitical acts involve violence. Yesterday, the StateDepartment said South Africa has released 1,050 prisoners,but it didn't say how many people overall are being held asprisoners by South Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
