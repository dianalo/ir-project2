<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-0557 </DOCNO><TEXT>A threshold Cherenkov counter is described. Its radiator is made as acell (200x400x60 mm) filled with an aqueous amino-G-salt solution. Amino-G-saltis used to convert Cherenkov radiation in the range of 400-550 nm. Thelight collection efficiency changes insignificantly within the radiatorvolume. The counter is used in the magnetic spectrometer for particleidentification and selective triggering. 9 refs.; 6 figs.; 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
