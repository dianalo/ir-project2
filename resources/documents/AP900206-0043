The solvents include methyl ethyl ketone, manufactured primarilyby Exxon Corp. and Shell Oil Co., the Los Angeles Times reported,citing unidentified sources.   The move was authorized under new legislation and targets aboutone in five of the companies that were regular importers of U.S.industrial solvents, the newspaper said.   Disclosures indicating the extensive role of U.S.-originatedchemicals in South American cocaine production were scheduled to berevealed today in a U.S. Senate subcommittee hearing looking intosuch chemical exports, the Times said.   The Drug Enforcement Administration's action could force SouthAmerican companies to turn to European suppliers.   U.S. manufacturers argue they double check to make certain theirinternational customers have legitimate uses for the solvents, buta senior official with the Chemical Manufacturers Association saidU.S. exports often are diverted to cocaine producers.   ``It can happen that products are sold to a customer who seemslegitimate and that the product then is diverted into illegal drugmarketing,'' R. Garrity Baker, the association's director ofinternational activities, said Monday.   The 52 companies were among 288 described as ``regularcustomers'' for U.S. exports. U.S. officials in Bogota, Colombia,said many of the businesses were fronts for Colombian drug cartels.   Regular customer status allows Latin American companies toreceive U.S. shipments with less documentation. Removing the statuseffectively bars them from receiving exported solvents, DEAofficials told congressional investigators.   The DEA refused to identify the companies. The date of thecustomer status reclassification was not reported. None of the U.S.exporters affected have challenged the ban.   The Times reported earlier that 90 percent of the 13 milliongallons of methyl ethyl ketone exported to Colombia last year wasbelieved to have been used in cocaine laboratories.   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., last week introduced legislation tooutlaw export of the chemical. Sen. Richard H. Bryan, D-Nev.,responsible for the subcommittee hearing probing the exports, saidhe will urge the President Bush to bring up the chemical exportissue during his drug summit in Colombia.   ``This is a serious problem, and there is more that (the UnitedStates) can do,'' Bryan said.</TEXT></DOC>
