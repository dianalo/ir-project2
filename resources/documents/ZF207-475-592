 Of thecurrent typesetting suppliers, we believe that only Linotype can show alonger commitment to this industry.andP;  Having surmounted serious financialproblems in the 1970s that would have killed many lesser companies, Monotypehas again become one of the major worldwide prepress suppliers.andP;  At the sametime, it has been one of the significant innovators in typesettingtechnology.andP;  It is also one of the few European companies without an American(or Americanized) technology that has managed to establish itself in the U.S.andM;Despite these achievements, Monotype still attracts wide speculation aboutits financial and market position.andP;  Unlike a number of companies in theprepress area, Monotype is a public company--its shares are traded on theLondon Stock Exchange--so its financial performance is available for all tosee; its ups and downs cannot be hidden, as is the case with companies thatare subsidiaries of firms with deep pockets.andM;Company historyandM;The history of Monotype is part of the history of typesetting.andP;  It is in asimilar position to Linotype (formerly Mergenthaler Linotype) in that it hascontinued as a single organization dedicated to the typesetting industrysince its inception as Lanston Monotype in 1891.andP;  The initial Monotypemachine was produced in 1893.andM;Although it began as an American organization with a British subsidiaryfounded in 1897, it became a totally British company as The MonotypeCorporation in 1931; the Lanston Monotype company later died in the U.S.andP;  Asone of the original hot-metal suppliers, Monotype served the qualitycomposition markets, whereas the line caster suppliers--Linotype andIntertype--served the newspaper, magazine and lower-quality book areas.andP;  Thatis not to say that line casters were not used for quality work, but thelimitations of the line casting process in character positioning meant thatthe character casting of Monotype was more suitable for compositors needingthe best quality.andM;Monotype was an early entrant into the phototypesetting markets with itsMonophoto machines, in which a camera essentially replaced the lead pot andcasting molds, and a series of exchangeable film negatives per characterreplaced the individual casting matrices needed for hot metal.andP;  The firstsuch machine was released in 1955, and various improved models were developedover the next 10 years.andM;Monotype's financial problems started in the mid-1960s.andP;  The company, whichwas still private, fell into the hands of new owners who appeared to see morepotential from the development of Monotype's large industrial site nearLondon's Gatwick Airport than from the development of Monotype's typesettingbusiness.andP;  Money for development of new products was in short supply.andM;Just at this time the market was changing radically; new higher-technologyentrants like Compugraphic and Varityper appeared, and the major Europeantype founder Berthold began to attack the traditional Monotype qualitycomposition market with a very high-quality unit.andP;  Monotype did bring out newmachines, including the Monophoto 400, 400/8, 600, and 2000; however, thesewere all produced in low volume, and they were targeted only at thetraditional Monotype market.andP;  They produced high quality, but they lackedmuch of the flexibility of the new machines from other manufacturers.andP;  Theyalso continued to use either large-format or rather expensive specializedMonotype paper tape keyboards.andP;  Detailed analysis of those products, as wellas further background on Langston and his company in the early 199s, can befound in our 1973 overview of Monotype (Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  18).andM;Lasercomp to the rescue.andP;  A surprising development, and the one thatultimately saved Monotype from going out of business, was its introductionand establishment of the first fourth-generation typesetter, the Lasercomp.andO;Cynics within the company joked that because Monotype took so long to developand refine any product, it decided to move from the second generation to thefourth generation, skipping the third-generation CRT typesetters, to at leastensure that its product got there first.andM;The development of the Lasercomp, the world's first high-resolution rastertypesetter, which was introduced in 1976, was a major achievement.andP;  It brokenew ground in computing and imaging technologies.andM;A competitor at the time derided the achievement by stating that it Monotypehad understood what it was doing it would never have started on theLasercomp, because the problems of manufacturing such a unit were thenbelieved unsolvable at an economic price.andP;  Indeed, when the company tried toget many of the precision optical parts made, no supplier could be found inEurope or the U.S.andP;  that could build to the required tolerances.andM;A company takeover.andP;  Bringing the Lasercomp to the market successfully wasbeyond the financial capabilities of Monotype.andP;  The company's owners, havingfailed to get approval for their development plans for the monotype site,failed to provide any further funding, and massive debts built up.andP;  TheLasercomp initially sold poorly.andP;  Compared to the third-generation CRTmachines (APS-5, Linotron 202, et al.), it had significant drawbacks for textoutput.andP;  It required a separate font master for each typefont/point sizecombination.andP;  It could not expand, condense or oblique type.andP;  Because it hadto sweep the entire width of the exposure window, it took as long to expose asingle-column galley as it did to expose the full width of a 58-pica page.andM;It was only later, as Monotype added more graphic capabilities to the machineand as fron-end systems capable of text and graphics pagination began toemerge, that the Lasercomp finally came into its own.andP;  Before that happeneed,Monotype fell into dire financial straits.andM;In 1978 Monotype was rescued by the British Government venture fundingoperation, The National Enterprise Board, which--together with Barclays Bank,one of the major creditors--took over the company.andM;While the new structure helped Monotype develop and market the Lasercompproduct (details of which are covered later in this article), Monotype stillsuffered from under-capitalization; it never had the money to progresssubstantially.andP;  Nevertheless, the Lasercomp established its niche in themarket, particulary at the top of the newspaper area where its uniquefacilities for speed, total page output of text and graphics and negativepage output were appreciated.andP;  At the same time, Monotype built up itsposition in the Middle and Far East and India, where specific projects, oftenin joint ventures, were succeeding.andM;These successes provided the credibility for a financial restructuring in1983.andP;  Outstanding debts of more than 8 million pounds were removed, and Cityof London investors injected 1.5 million pounds of new capital.andP;  By 1985,Monotype was established as a well-run and soundly based organization, and inmay 1986 it was floated on the Unlisted Securites Market of the London StockExchange.andM;This offering raised 4.67 million pounds and spurred further growth.andP;  Inaddition to building up its core business, Monotype acquired a number ofother businesses that it believed were relevant to its marketing objectives.andO;Some of these objectives were met by increasing the share capital of thecompany.andP;  For example, the French prepress systems supplier Graphic SystemsEquipment was acquired through the placement of 920,000 shares of 2 poundseach with French financial institutions.andM;In April 1988, Monotype was admitted to the Official List of the London StockExchange.andP;  The company's objective was to improve the market for its sharesand to increase its status internationally.andM;Profits, losses and rumors.andP;  Like many other companies within this industry,Monotype saw its profitability fall in 1988 as the company adjusted to rapidchanges in the publishing market.andP;  In the first half of 1988 it posted apretax loss of 1,618,000 pounds on a higher turnover than in the same periodof the previous year.andP;  In the second half of 1988 it returned toprofitability with a pretax gain of 1,286,000 pounds.andM;Since that time, there have been rumors that Monotype had financial problems,and there was speculation about possible acquisition.andP;  These rumors have comemainly out of the U.S., where a number of executives and sales peopple haveleft and Monotype's position among U.S.andP;  newspapers has been hurt by thesuccess of Autologic's APS--6 typesetter, which now appears to achieve atleast equivalent performance in text and graphics to the established Monotypeunits.andP;  American analysts tend, however, to forget that Monotype has aworldwide business, and that in 1987 the U.S.andP;  generated less than 20 percentof Monotype's total revenues.andM;We asked Monotype about such rumors and about its general financial position.andO;Monotype must be very careful about what is says, because it is a publiccompany governed by the very strict rules of the London Stock Exchange, whichare understood to be tighter than those of the U.S.andP;  We were advised thatMonotype is largely owned by approximately 150 major financial and investmentinstitutions in the City of London that regard the shares as a long-terminvestment.andP;  Very few shares are traded, so even the smallest number canaffect share price.andP;  Monotype knows of no approaches to the company orshareholders where there has been a positive intent to make a bid for thecompany.andM;Our attention was drawn to a recently publicized document issued by Monotypeon the 21st of March 1989, when it sold its stake in Chelgraph Products, ajoint venture with De La Rue.andP;  Roger Day, Monotype's chairman, stated:andM;&quot;The interim results of the Monotype groupd for the six months ended 31stDecember, 1988 were announced today.andP;  You will see from the results thatMonotype achieved profits before tax of 1.3 million pounds in the second halfof 1988 but, as foreshadowed in my letter to shareholders dated 31st January1989, this was not sufficient to offset losses arising from the first half ofthe year.andP;  With the change in year end to the 31st March, I will be reportingin July on the first three months of 1989 and I am confident that Monotype'sperformance in this period will be better than in the comparable period of1988.&quot;andP;  (Note that this does not necessarily mean that the company will showa profit for this period, only that it will not lose as much money as it didin the comparable period last year.)andM;Day later continued: &quot;Your board believes that the signs for the financialyear beginning next month are encouraging and anticipates a return toprofitability of the core business.andP;  I will give you updated information onthis when I write to you in July with the full results for the 15 months to31st March 1989.&quot;andM;In the meantime, Monotype is currently overhauling its large industrial site,replacing the outdated factories with a large modern new factory and offices.andO;Together with an outside propery company it will use the remaining 11 acresof its site, which it no longer needs, to create a new business park.andP;  Thisconversion is already well under way, and Monotype views it as an investmentthat should show handsome returns in the future.andM;Monotype's strengths.andP;  One aspect of Monotype that is not generallyappreciated is its strength as a worldwide supplier.andP;  Monotype has a verysignificant position throughout the Asian marketplace, with a particularstronghold in India, and an increasingly sound position in ideographiclanguage areas.andP;  It is a major worldwide supplier of output devices to thenewspaper industry, but ouside of Europe it is perhaps seen more as asupplier to the commercial typesettig markets.andP;  In Europe it does well inmany countries, particularly the UK, France and Italy, where it has beenespecially successful in the newspaper market segment.andM;Another factor that must be considered is that unlike many of its competitorsMonotype has expanded its business base through acquisition in recent years,and an increasing share of its sales and profits is coming from these newcompanies.andP;  Some of them, such as GB Techniques and Graphic Systems, are inthe traditional prepress areas, but others are more involved incommunication.andP;  They operate independently, but have the potential to helpthe prepress segment develop future technologies.andM;Monotype also believes in development of joint venture operations--takingless than a 100-percent stake in companies.andP;  It recently disposed of itsinterests in Chelgraph Products, a company it cofounded with Chelgraph Ltd.andO;to make and distribute products developed by the latter firm.andP;  It has justfounded a new joint venture company, MonoText, with the Swedish organizationTextData, which is covered in detail later in this article.andM;A further communications investment was its acquisition of a 60-percent stakein Sinclair Communications UK, which previously had acquired thecommunications interests of Muirhead that were not acquired when Crosfieldtook over Muirhead's page facsimile business.andP;  There is synergy betweenSinclair and one of Monotype's other companies, Intertec, which developed thePicture Post news wire system.andM;Moving in new directions.andP;  Monotype has been going through a major transitionover the past few years as it moves towards the 1990s.andP;  It is creating a morecompact, less labor-intensive operation in the UK, and at the same time it isfacing the problem of the chaning structure of the industry brought about bythe fourth wave of publishing technology.andP;  Monotype has not been hit asheavily by this change as some other suppliers, because it had already movedout of the lower end of the market into the performance-related medium- andlarge-scale newspaper areas.andP;  Also, its core business has not been as asystem supplier.andM;While it did not move into desktop publishing as early as Linotype, and onlyannounced a PostScript agreement in June of last year (with its firstproducts in September), Monotype entered the desktop publishing servicemarket as the first typesetting supplier to develop direct interfaces to theQuickDraw imaging model of the Macintosh.andP;  It has benefited from working withthe desktop publishing revolution rather than against it.andP;  Furtherdevelopments, to be announced later this year, will strengthen its hand as asystem integrator in the lower end of the market.andM;Monotype's strategy for the 1990sandM;Fundamental changes are in the works from Monotype as part of its futurebusiness plan.andP;  The company is now a major believer in PostScript, but italso believes that for many markets the best current solution is to integratePostScript into its existing applications so that customers get the benefitsof PostScript functionality where it is needed, plus the performance ofMonotype's systems where they are appropriate.andM;The first major change is the introduction of a new high-performance RIP fora range of typesetters.andP;  This new Series 3 RIP, which isinput-code-compatible with the previous Monotype RIPs, will support in itsinitial minimum configuration a level of performance that few companies haveyet achieved.andM;The RIP is designed to allow substantial increases in performance in thefuture in terms of both higher imaging speeds and higher imaging resolutions.andO;It is also designed to handle full color, as Monotype sees that color is anessential element of any future strategy.andM;To support this new thrust into high performance, Monotype is buttressing itsgraphics functionality, and the Series II Graphic System running on SunMicrosystems hardware has been significantly enhanced to operate as a fulllarge-scale graphics input and management system.andP;  The Series II is alsobeing further developed for color, and next May at Drupa Monotype will be oneof a number of typesetting vendors making a bid to become a real player inthe color market.andP;  We are already seeing the capabilities of Monotype as asupplier of high-speed color imaging devices with its initial installation atthe French color news magazine L'Express.andP;  Its new developments in software,combined with the high-performance imaging devices, from a system thatMonotype expects will be attractive to newspapers and magazines for theoutput of total pages with color.andM;Within this article we will review key elements of Monotype's strategy forthe future.andP;  This reveiw will not be exhaustive; we shall only look at thekey typesetting business.andP;  Not covered will be companies like GB Techniquesand Graphic Systems and their products, nor will products like Picture Postfrom Intertec, although that will be mentioned within the coverage ofgraphics.andM;Here we will focus on the new Series 3 RIP, which is used in the Prism,Express S3 and Pioneer S3 imagesetters; PostScript; and the Monotype imagingengine technology.andP;  We will also cover Monotype's latest joint venture,MonoText, which is once again taking Monotype back into the high-qualitycommercial marketplace from which it originated.andM;Monotype and the Lasercomp RIPandM;Monotype and the RIP are almost synonymous.andP;  While Monotype would not claimto be the first organization to develop a raster output system, it was thefirst company to introduce high-performance, high-resolution raster imageprocessing into typesetting, and it was the first to show the benefit of thisprocessing with the merging of text and graphics.andP;  This was al part of theoriginal Lasercomp design.andM;Old ideas in modern settings.andP;  When Monotype introduced the Lasercomp in 1976it was not the first laser typesetter.andP;  That honor goes to the short-livedlaser typesetter from Dymo Graphic Systems.andP;  However, the Lasercomp, whichentered the market a few months after the Dymo unit, was the first rastersetting typesetter.andP;  (The Dymo unit attempted to simulate the operation of aCRT unit with a mix of vertical and horizontal stroking.)andP;  The Lasercomp alsobecame the first successful laser typesetter in the market.andP;  It wassurprising that it took many years for any other company to introduce a lasertypesetter.andP;  Nowadays almost all typesetters are raster-based laser units.andM;The basic ideas that were introduced in the first Lasercomp in 1976 are stillcommon in all typesetters today, and in fact the initial RIP design, while ithas been extensively enhanced, is still basically the same in the currentMonotype Lasercomp, Express and Pioneer units.andP;  The new Series 3 RIP, as usedinitially in the Monotype Prism and now introduced in the high-performanceExpress S3, is a major change in direction for Monotype.andM;There has been one different approach along the way: the Series 2 RIP fromMonotype.andP;  This RIP, which was introduced in 1983 in the Sprint and thenrepackaged and moved into the Blaser, was based on a Z-8000 microprocessorcontroller and bit-slice processor RIP.andP;  In hindsight, the Series 2 might betermed a major learning exercise for Monotype, as this RIP never achieved theintended specification.andP;  Yet many of its ideas have been absorbed into thenew Series 3 unit.andP;  The Series 3 incorporates the lessons of continuallyboosting the function and performance of the Series 1 RIP, plus the lessonslearned in developing the Series 2.andM;The longevity of the first Monotype RIP is impressive.andP;  The ideas for it wereput together in early 1975, and yet its developments are still the yardstickfor performance for metro newspapers today.andM;Lasercomp and RIP: a history.andP;  It is interesting to trace the structure ofMonotype hardware and software over the past 13 years since the introductionof the Lasercomp.andP;  The product started out using the Computer Automation LSI2computer with 32k 16-bit words of memory.andP;  At that stage, the RIP drove onlythe first 58-pica-wide Lasercomp, using an intelligent typesetting programthat had evolved from Monotype's earlier 1000 and 2000 typesetters.andM;In 1979 monotype changed to the more powerful Computer Automation LSI4computer with 64K words of memory.andP;  The major difference obtained fromchanging computers, apart from having a greater degree of pure horsepower,was the ability to microcode certain functions into the computer.andP;  Monotypemade extensive use of this ability by building a microcoded specialinstruction set that increased performance and reduced the number ofadditional circuit boards the system needed.andP;  The LSI4 computer, which isstill in use today, was used when the 100-pica version of the Lasercomp wasintroduced in 1979 for the newspaper market.andM;In 1980 Monotype introduced full text and graphics integration with screeningof halftones on the fly (as the data was passed to the imagesetter) duringthe output pass without degrading performance.andP;  This enhancement was madepossible by the addition of a halftone screening board, plus an interface forthe eCRM Autokon for inputting graphics.andP;  At the ANPA show in Atlanta thatyear, when Monotype showed this facility for the first time, the worldsuddenly realized that this quaint, unusual typesetter from across the pondwas something special; no other device on the market could achieve such alevel of performance in handling complete pages, particularly in negativeform.andM;Hardware developments and software enhancements continued to keep theLasercomp up to date and competitive with both CRT machines and new lasertypesetters.andP;  One initial deficiency of the Lasercomp that was seized upon bythe competition was that it could not scale type to a chosen size--all fontshad to be size-for-size bit maps.andP;  Thi srequirement existed because scalingfonts during the rasterizing process was too great a computing task at thattime.andP;  With CRT machines there was no such problem because most scaling wasan analog rather than a digital process or, as in the case of digitalmachines like the Linotron 202, the machine could stop exposing while anindividual character was scaled.andP;  This could not be done on the Lasercompbecause in one scan line a large number of characters were output at the sametime.andM;The first development to improve this situation wascalled software sizing.andO;The fonts were delivered to customers as master bit-mapped fonts, which couldthen be loaded as size-for-size bit maps onto the Lasercomp disk via a loadprogram.andP;  This approach lowered prices because the customer could createwhatever sizes were necessary when required.andP;  The use of an 80-MB disk on theLasercomp also helped in areas of font storage.andM;Software sizing still did not fully solve the problem because the user had topredict beforehand whic sizes were required for a job, and if the requiredsizes were not available a default font would be used.andP;  A further newfacility, online sizing, enabled the software sizing program to be calledduring production to create the required size of a font and to load it ontothe disk.andP;  The disk was divided into a permanent and a temporary font area,and the online sized fronts were written into the temporary area.andP;  When thisarea wasfull, the oldest used font would be overwritten by the latest scaledfont.andP;  This process was all transparent to the user, so the system had allthe same functionality as the CRT machines with real-time font sizing fromoutline fonts on demand.andM;A further development to improve the Lasercomp font scaling came later.andO;On-the-fly sizing used the stored simple outline, and the sized output fontwas created on the output pass by software with microcode assistance.andP;  Thissized font was not stored.andP;  The on-the-fly facility was usually reserved forspecial functions, including rotation of characters, which were useful fordisplay ads in particular.andM;Other developments constantly improved the performance of the Lasercomp andled to the introduction of the high-performance (24 inches per minute)Monotype Express, which was heralded by the acronym PAMWEII (page a minutewith everything in it).andP;  The RIP gained a facility called Turbo RAM, whichwas 500 KB (now 2 MB) of high-speed RAM used as a solid state disk.andM;Turbo RAM was used to handle input and output to peripherals, storingdirectories, and holding jobs files.andP;  Job files are all the objects in a pagethat must be combined and rasterized in the output pass.andP;  This used to be adisk-bound facility called merge, but with Turbo RAM the merge phase waseliminated, making the processing much faster.andM;The current Series 1.andP;  This brings the Series 1 RIP up to its present state.andO;At present, there are more than 1,000 of them in use around the world.andM;The current RIP is built around a Computer Automation LSI4 computer, or aUK-developed compatible lookalike.andP;  The disk drive can be from a wide rangeof choices depending upon the user's needs for font and graphic storage.andO;They may be SMD-compatible Winchesters (usually 160 MB), or 300-MBexchangeable disks, or SD-506 Winchesters of various sizes from 80 MBupwards.andP;  Turbo RAM is built into the Express and Pioneer machines and is anoption on the Lasercomp 70i and 100i units.andM;The developments on the Series 1 RIP have not finished, however, and a numberof beta site installations are now outputting color from the Pioneer andExpress units using a new color screening board, which enables differentselected screen angles to be produced during output without degradation ofperformance.andP;  The best known beta site is L'Express, which is using a Pioneerunit to output most of its color pages with a 133-line screen ruling, asfully registered separations.andM;The Series 3 RIPandM;Depite all these developments, the Lasercomp and its express and Pioneerderivatives were increasingly being seen as &quot;old technology&quot; compared withdevelopments from other vendors, even though few of them can achieve theperformance of the Express.andP;  Given the company's future direction, whichspecifies higher resolutions than the 1,000 lines per inch of the Lasercompand Express and the 1,500 lines per inch of the Pioneers in order to do colorseparations, as well as its need for lower-resolution proofing and moreextensive non-Latin language support, the time was right for Monotype to moveinto a future RIP generation.andM;It is doing so with the new Series 3, which was quietly introduced lastSeptember at IPEX with the Prism typesetter.andP;  This debut was overshadowed byMonotype's introduction of Adobe PostScript as an option for all itstypesetters.andM;We first came across the Series 3 product in discussions with Monotype inearly 1988, when a prototype was being shown to a limited number ofprospective customers, including Robert Maxwell's Mirror Group Newspapers,which was subsequently one of the beta test sites for the Express S3.andO;Monotype has been quietly testing the Express S3 in customer sites inproduction in Europe and the U.S.andP;  for some months, so it was well proven atthe time of its launch this month at ANPA.andP;  There are also more than 30Prisms in operation using the Series 3 RIP.andP;  The remaining Prisms in use arePostScript machines.andM;Series 3 is a multiprocessor RIP, where processors on a common VME bus workconcurrently.andP;  In the first implementations in the Prism and Express S3, themultiple processors have not been required; they are intended more for futurework with higher resolutions, even higher speeds, and integration of otherimaging models.andM;A three-card RIP.andP;  The Series 3 RIP is a VME bus-based system.andP;  It has a10-slot backplane, but in its minimum configuration only three cards areused.andM;The first card is a single-board computer of Monotype's design with a 16-MHzMotorola 68020 processor, which can be easily changed to run at 25 MHz ifrequired.andP;  On this card are 4 MB of memory, hard and floppy disk controllers,RS232 and 422 serial and 8-bit (Centronics) parallel interfaces.andP;  An extra 4MB of memory can be added to this card.andM;The second card is the workhorse of the system--a 16-bit, bit-slice AMD 29101processor with 2 MB of on-board memory.andP;  A further 2 MB can be added.andM;The third care is the output buffer board.andP;  This takes commands as an objectlist from the bit-slice processor, and it contains special logic forconstructing the raster lines at the selected output resolution.andP;  There is 1MB of RAM on this card for scan-line buffers.andP;  A piggyback add-on to thiscard is the new monochrome halftone screening board.andM;Additional single-board computer cards can be added to the system to sharethe load.andP;  This is not required to support the performance and resolution ofthe current output units, but it is more important for higher resolutions,for ideographic languages, and for supporting other imaging models.andM;The other currently available additional cards are the following:andM;* AppleTalk interface card to support the AppleTalk environment.andM;* 16-bit parallel interface card for handling high-speed graphics input; theintelligence on this card minimizes overhead on the main processor.andP;  Thiscard would be used to connect the Monotype Series II Graphic System or othersuch devices, or for any type of high-speed interfacing.andM;* The new Monotype Laserbus interface (described below).andM;There is no Ethernet or other high-speed LAN interface because Monotypecurrently sees the use of PCs as a better and cheaper way of handling suchinterfacing.andM;Enhancements on the way.andP;  The software on the Series 3 supports a compatibleversion of Monotype's slave input language.andP;  It is built around a real-timeoperating executive called pSOS.andP;  There are also planned extensions to theslave language to enable almost anything on a page to be imaged.andM;One of these additions will be a new combination mode of output.andP;  Currentlythe slave language has four modes: white and black, each in the&quot;exclusive-or&quot; writing mode and the new &quot;replace&quot; mode.andP;  Exclusive-or modereverses the sense of the background bits under the writing location.andP;  Thismeans that if one is writing white type on a black background and the typethen moves onto a white background, the type will immediately change from thepoint of transition into black type.andM;The new mode will be a &quot;replace&quot; mode that will clear the background bitswith a white mode.andP;  This means that with one operation the user can have anopaque mode where the background is hidden, or a transparent mode (which isone of the few functions PostScript does not support) where one also sees thebackground.andP;  Opaque mode is already available but it requires the drivingsystem to first fill the defined area with white.andP;  The slave software workson the basis of stacking objects on top of each other in the order in whichthey are received, and each object has a defined writing mode.andM;There are also plans to make available additional graphics primitives.andP;  Atpresent it is possible to create almost any shape with the low-level GeneralArea Primitive, in addition to the line, box, and round corner instructions.andO;Monotype plans to offer access to primitives for polygons, arcs and evenbezier curves.andP;  These would require system developers to enhance the routinesto output Monotype slave code.andM;A further software enhancement is that images will be callable byalphanumeric names instead of just numbers.andM;Fonts: Qubic and other formats.andP;  A major difference in the Series 3 is itsfont handling.andP;  In the Series 1, the fonts used for output were size-to-sizebit maps.andP;  These could be created from the delivered font format, which wouldbe held on disk as a master font.andP;  In the Series 2 RIP, as used in the sprintand Blaser, fonts were held as straight-line vector outlines; these werescaled and rasterized at the time of output.andP;  In the Series 3, the fonts areheld in Monotype's new Qubic format, which is a Bezier-curve, vector-outlineformat.andM;Monotype is converting its entire library to the Qubic format, and currentlysome 600 faces are in it, including some Greek and Russian fonts.andP;  Noideographic, Arabic, Indian or other non-Latin faces have been converted yet,but the total Monotype digitized library will be in Qubic format in the nearfuture.andM;One reason Monotype has delayed the introduction of Series 3 machines in itsmainstream business area is to ensure that a sufficient volume of fonts willbe available at its release.andM;We also expect that the Series 3 RIP will support the Folio F3 format fontsin the future through an additional font imaging module.andP;  This will enablethe entire Linotype, Berthold and other libraries also in this format to beused with the system.andP;  This is a good example of the benefits of the new openfont formats.andM;Speed and color.andP;  The Series 3 can, as we stated before, image almostanything on a page very quickly.andP;  It will now be possible, for example, usingthe Express S3 108-pica unit, to rotate a double-truck broadsheet page, suchas in a newspaper center spread.andP;  The only limitation is that the Series 3RIP does not yet rotate contone images.andP;  This would have to be done prior tothe output on the Monotype Series II Graphic System.andP;  Rotating the total pagetakes only a few seconds.andM;At present the Series 3 RIP does not support screening of color images.andO;Monotype intends to have this facility available by September, as the lessonslearned from the beta work on the Series 1 RIP at various sites areincorporated into the new Series 3 color screening board.andM;Series 3 interfacing.andP;  We mentioned above that one of the cards that is addedto the Series 3 VME card cage is the Laserbus controller.andP;  Laserbus isMonotype's new interfacing structure to drive output devices.andP;  All of itsimaging devices--the Lasercomp, Express, Pioneer and Prism--now use a controlcard within the typesetter called the LOU (Laser Output Unit) to connect theoutput unit with the RIP that drives it.andP;  The LOU is responsible for controland timing of all the elements of the output device and for receiving rasterdata from the RIP.andM;An alternative for driving other output devices from the Series 3 RIP isMonotype's new Laserbus.andP;  The Series 3 has output capabilities for both LOUand Laserbus.andM;Laserbus is a four-way twisted-pair interface that can drive the unit atdistances of up to 1,000 feet from the RIP.andP;  An output device would need tohave a personality card to link to the Laserbus.andP;  Currently, Monotype hasdeveloped personality cards for the Canon 300- and 400-dpi SX, DataproductsA3 and Minolta A3 480-dpi printers.andM;Monotype plans to drive higher-resolution devices via the Laserbus in thefuture.andP;  For example, it will offer a Laserbus connection for the CrosfieldDatrax, which is currently driven by Monotype's Series 1 RIP.andM;The Laserbus can address up to sixteen output devices at once and boasts atop speed of about 20 megabits/second.andP;  At this speed, it is unlikely thatthe system would support a distance of 1,000 feet.andM;For driving laser printers there would be a one-page buffer in the system.andO;One potential use is for proofing, where individual dumb laser engines plusLaserbus personality cards would be in specific departments, and the proofsrasterized by the Series 3 RIP into the one-page buffer would be sent towhichever department requested the proof.andP;  This would enable the same RIP tobe used for high-resolution output and for proofing, and it would free thenetwork at the same time.andM;A further extension to this is LaserPlex, a multiplexing device thatinterconnects four Laservus inputs and four Laserbus outputs.andP;  In theory thisenables one RIP to drive up to 64 high- and low-resolution imaging engines.andO;It enables different RIPs to share a range of output devices and printers.andO;Figures 1 and 2 show some of the uses for this.andM;PC interfacing.andP;  As we said, Monotype views the PC as the best way ofinterfacing to Ethernet and other LANs.andP;  The company is developing a familyof PC-based interfacing solutions that will provide both interfacing andproduction spooling.andP;  The initial products for this are Ethernet to Series 3RIP and running multiple Adobe Atlas Plus RIPs on an AppleTalk network into asingle output device to improve production speeds.andM;Embracing PostScriptandM;In addition to all the above developments in its own RIPs and driverlanguages, Monotype is also a licensee of Adobe PostScript.andP;  At IPEX in theUK and at the Desktop Publishing Conference in the U.S.andP;  last September,Monotype introduced its Adobe RIP, which used Adobe's Atlas Plus design.andO;This product is sold in two forms: as an add-on RIP to a Monotype typesetterwith either a Series 1 or a Series 3 RIP, and, in the case of the Prism, as aPostScript-only typesetter, the Prism PS.andM;PostScript RIP and interfaces.andP;  The Atlas Plus RIP has a 68020 processorrunning at 16 MHz and 8 MB of memory, although this can be increased to 16MB, as has been done with a number of installed systems.andP;  Monotype has beenexperimenting with an enhanced version of the PostScript RIP using a 25-MHz68020 processor with faster memory, and for some jobs this shows a speedincrease of up to 50 percent.andP;  (This may not seem as much as the claimedincreases that Linotype is achieving with its Saturn RIP, which has the sameenhanced specification, but the Atlas Plus with 8 MB of memory was alreadyfaster than Linotype's 6-MB Atlas).andM;Monotype has developed the means by which its PostScript and Monotype RIPsmay work together--some additional elements that reside within the PostScriptRIP cabinet.andP;  They are a RIP switch and a product called Integrator.andM;The RIP switch directs and output from both the Adobe RIP and the Monotype tothe LOU board of the output device.andP;  In this way it enables the two RIPs toshare a common imaging engine as separate page generators (see Figure 1).andM;With the Integrator, one can add a command into the PostScript file to passthe data to the second output port of the RIP switch, which them passes it tothe Integrator.andP;  This product converts the rasterized data into a Monotypegraphic file and back to the Monotype RIP, where it is written to the RIP'sdisk, and from which it can be called as a graphic by a slave languagecommand for inclusion in the page.andP;  Thus, with the integrator, one can mixPostScript and Monotype data on the one page.andP;  It is intended thatnewspapers, for example, will convert PostScript images to Monotype formatahead of time, and then output the full newspaper page at greater speedwithout sacrificing the PostScript compatibility.andM;The Integrator can also write data back into the Monotype Series II Graphicsystem, where there is a separate PostScript converter, as well as the meansto create low-resolution view files (see PostScript conversion, below).andM;The RIP switch can also have a Laserbus output, so together with a LaserPlexone can use both the Adobe PostScript RIP and the Series 3 to share a rangeof output proof printers and high-resolution imagers.andP;  The LaserPlex cansupport output to the Monotype LOU board as well as Laserbus (see Figure 2).andM;PostScript conversion.andP;  We just mentioned the conversion of PostScript datavia the Adobe PostScript software and the Monotype Atlas Plus RIP with theIntegrator product.andP;  But Monotype also handles PostScript conversion in otherareas of its systems.andP;  The first of these is the new logo scanning softwarefor the Series 3 RIP.andP;  This uses an Apple Macintosh II running standarddesktop-level software.andP;  Images are scanned on a 300- or 400-dpi scanner, andthe resulting data stream is processed through the new Adobe Streamlinesoftware to create an Adobe Illustrator image.andM;Before conversion, editing may take place on the scanned data with a graphicsediting package.andP;  Images in Adobe Illustrator format may be edited withinIllustrator or other software that reads Illustrator files.andP;  After editing,the files are converted by a Monotype software package into a Monotypegraphic format that can be called from an input command in the Monotype slavelanguage.andM;Logo images, for which there is no defined maximum size, may be stored on thedisk of the Series 3 Monotype typesetter, or on the Monotype Series IIGraphic System.andM;Another Monotype conversion system runs on the Sun workstation of the SeriesII Graphic System.andP;  This one takes any PostScript data and converts it intoMonotype graphic format, which would then be treated as a graphic called bycommand within the slave input command language.andP;  With the ability of theGraphic System to generate a low-resolution (i.e., screen-resolution) versionof its images that may be sent to a front-end system, this facility meansthat PostScript images can be displayed on any front-end terminal that canwork Monotype low-resolution image data.andM;Monotype imaging enginesandM;There are two main elements in a laser typesetter: the RIP and the output(also called recording or imaging) engine.andP;  Until now, we have devoted ourattention to Monotype's RIP.andP;  But the output engine is equally crucial to thesuccess of any laser typesetter.andP;  Indeed, laser engines are generally moresophisticated in their engineering than CRT-based units because writingpage-wide scans with precise accuracy is tricky.andP;  A raster typesetter thatwrites a complete individual scan line horizontally across the material,rather than building a complete character through vertical strokes within animaging window, brings a number of very complicated technologies together.andM;Interestingly, this split of functions between RIP and engine has allowed anumber of companies such as ECRM, Ultre and Bidco to create businesses out ofjust supplying the imaging engine, and many other companies have createdbusinesses out of supplying RIPs.andM;Today, many major typesetting vendors make only one part of the system.andO;Autologic and Berthold, for example, buy imaging engines from ECRM; Autologicalso buys from Bidco, and Berthold also makes its own highest-resolutionengine.andP;  Other companies that make but one half of some or all of theirproducts include Birmy, Camex, Chelgraph, Digital Technology International,Hell, Hell Xenotron, Hyphen and Tegra.andM;Monotype is one of the companies that continues to make both, harking back tothe days of CRT machines, when there was no functional split and hence nosuch marketing structure.andP;  Until the Lasercomp, no organization had built araster engine using a laser to the specification Monotype wished to achieveat that price.andP;  The only other work in this direction was the effort tocreate a market for laser platemaking pursued by Eocom and Dow Jones.andM;Lasers and mirrors.andP;  In building suchdevices, Monotype broke new ground inoptical deflection systems to image the beam horizontally at acceptable speedacross the image area.andP;  The Monotype polygon multifaceted mirror system--inwhich each mirror deflects the beam for one scan line across the width of thematerial--had to be built to precise tolerances to ensure accuratescan-line-to-scan-line alignment.andM;In early Monotype systems it was reasonably common to find a machine beingused in single-facet mode, where only one of the five mirrors (or eight, asin the 58- and initial 70-pica units) would be used so as to eliminatebanding effects.andP;  This slowed down the unit's speed considerably.andP;  In the1970s, Monotype perfected its skills in building polygons to a high level ofaccuracy so that today it claims that it can make higher-resolution andhigher-speed devices than the competition using polygons, where no beamcompensation controls need to be included in the system to ensure accuratealignment of the output scan lines.andM;In the new Prism imagesetter, which is Monotype's laser diode typesetter, theoptical system is much simpler.andP;  Instead of a polygon with five facets, ituses a solid glass cube mounted directly on the drive from the motor.andP;  Thefirst Lasercomps in 1976 and 1977 used this direct-drive principle, but itwas quickly abandoned because Monotype could not prevent bearing wobble fromthe motor.andP;  This is no longer a problem, and Monotype has reintroduced theprinciple in the Prism.andM;The optical efficiency of the cube is far lower than that of the polygon:only around 20 percent of the rotation movement of the cube can beused forexposure compared with more than 80 percent in an Express or Pioneer.andP;  Thelens system is also much simpler.andM;Banding: an unusual approach.andP;  Among the problems faced by Monotype with itsLasercomp during its development and its refinement in the past twelve yearshas been one seen in most laser typesetters: horizontal banding.andP;  Banding isthe term used to describe thin horizontal streaks introduced into the outputby mechanical variations.andP;  Banding can be produced by a variety of factors,including wobble in the deflection system and uneven movement of the outputmedium.andP;  But it is particularly difficult to eliminate banding when theoutput unit must stop and start while it waits for the RIP to feed it data.andM;There are two separate approaches to the banding problem.andP;  The first is toimprove the functionality of the output unit so that such stops and startsare not seen in the output, which is the Monotype principle.andP;  The other is tomake an output unit that cannot stop and start once imaging has begun; inthis case the RIP must be fast enough to ensure data is always available, analmost impossible situation with PostScript, or it must have a buffer intowhich the RIP sends its data for a full page, before the page imaging starts.andO;This is the procedure of the Autologic PIP, where the fastest PIP has 100 MBof RAM.andP;  The problem with this solution is that each doubling of resolutionmeans a quadrupling of page buffer memory.andM;In the early 1980s, Monotype had to confront the problem of banding in theLasercomp output.andP;  This was particularly apparent in large tint areas, suchas in business forms.andP;  An extensive project, begun to fundamentally improvethe whole of the imaging system to eradicate banding, evaluated all areas ofthe system.andP;  Changes were made to the casting on which all modules weremounted to improve the rigidity and alignment of the parts of the system.andM;Once the positioning of the laser beam had been fully controlled throughlaser focusing, polygon alignment and lens improvements, the remainder of thework focused on the output unit.andP;  In an output unit, a huge number ofvariables can affect the final image quality.andM;The number of stops and starts that the output unit has to make while itawaits data from the RIP can be sorted out to a degree by adding extra scanline buffers, and all Monotype RIPs have reasonable scan line buffer memory.andO;Other areas are purely mechanical.andP;  For instance, the accuracy of materialfeed is influenced by the pressure required to pull material out of the inputcassette and push it into an output cassette.andP;  These loads differ dependingupon the amount of material in the cassettes.andM;The principles that came out of this exercise have been incorporated intolater output devices.andP;  All Monotype output devices now have a sophisticatedmaterial stop-start mechanism, with what is referred to as ramping.andP;  If anoutput unit must stop, the electronic control of the output unit knowsexactly how many micro steps it takes for the material to stop, and also howmany steps it takes to get the unit back up to operating speed.andM;Whenever the unit stops, the material is wound back a predetermined number ofmicro steps.andP;  When data is available from the RIP again, the unit isrestarted.andP;  It is up to speed again by the time the data is sent through thesystem, so that when the unit is in position for exposure, it is in exactlythe position at which the data flow stopped before.andP;  In a Monotype Pioneerthere are 64 mini-steps in each 1,500-dpi scan line.andP;  This ramping procedureis in all Monotype output devices, including the Prism.andM;With the new Series 3 RIP, there is seldom need for any stop-start, and therotated double-page spread of the Daily Express newspaper we saw--set by theExpress Series 3 as a sample in 55 seconds--had no stop-starts within it.andO;The situation is quite different, however, with PostScript, where the AtlasPlus RIP or any Adobe based RIP cannot keep up with the output device.andP;  WithPostScript, there is an almost continual stop-start.andM;When we saw an Adobe Illustrator job run on the Prism, we could hear theoutput constantly starting and stopping, but theresultant output showed nosigns of banding.andP;  The situation was the same with a tabloid newspaper pagecomplete with a number of halftones: again, no signs of any stop-starteffects.andP;  The samples we have seen of color separations from L'Express inParis also show excellent registration and consistency of imaging.andM;Monotype believes that the principles it has built into the output units willbecome increasingly important as it goes to higher resolutions and furtherhandling of color.andP;  It sees RAM-based page buffers as putting too high afinancial overhead on the cost of RIPS.andM;In pursuit of accuracy.andP;  Over the years Monotype has improved the imagingaccuracy of its output units to a level where they now appear to be as goodas or better than almost anything else in the market.andP;  The accuracy ofimaging repeatability for its Express and Pioneer output units is stated tobe plus or minus 2 mils over 10 inches.andP;  (The recently announced ECRM Pelbox3000 claims a similar accuracy over 12 inches).andM;This accuracy was achieved through a number of enhancements to the originalunit.andP;  The first is that all Monotype imaging engines (with the exception ofthat in the Lasercomp 100i) are built upon a rigid aluminum casting knownaffectionately within Monotype as the milk crate.andP;  There are three differentcastings, one each for the Prism, Lasercomp 70i, and Express/Pioneer.andP;  Ontothe casting are mounted all the major elements, such as the laser opticalsystem, lens and film transport.andP;  The single casting ensures accuracy ofalignment and eliminates vibrations set up by the polygon.andP;  The casting isfixed on vibration-absorbing mounts on the typesetting frame to eliminate anyvibrations from the disk.andM;To further improve quality, the Express and Pioneer have load stabilizingcontrols for handling the material from the input cassette to the feedrollers and thence to the take-up cassette.andP;  These controls maintain aconstant load pressure on the film or paper material to provide extremelyaccurate material feed and ensure absolute repeatability from page to page.andO;This is why the Express and Pioneer units are able to handle full colorseparation work at full speed.andP;  The Express, with its 1,000-dpi resolution,can handle screens of up to 100 lines; the Pioneer, with its 1,500-dpiresolution, achieves screens of up to 133 lines.andM;Tracing the optical path.andP;  In the Lasercomp range the basic design of theoptical system has hardly changed since its introduction in 1976.andP;  Manycomponents, such as the polygon and lens, have been substantially improvedover time.andP;  The optical path, however, is reasonably straightforward, withthe laser modulator being mounted directly on the end of the laser, and thenthe helium-neon laser beam being deflected 90[degrees] three times, through abeam expander to increase the size of the spot to cover one facet of thepolygon, and then 90[degrees] again onto the polygon facet.andP;  From there itgoes through the lens and onto the photographic material (see photo).andM;The lens has two main functions.andP;  The first is to focus the writing spot downto the defined size, and the second is to provide a field-flatteningoperation so that the spot has the same shape over the full width of thematerial.andM;With the Express and Pioneer output units the optical path is far morecomplicated.andP;  Here the laser is separated from the laser modulator and thelaser beam is very finely focused before entering the modulator to ensureabsolute beam accuracy (see photo).andM;The lens in each Monotype imaging engine is specifically designed for thetask, and different lenses are used in the Lasercomp 70i, 100i, 72-, 82-,100- and 108-pica Express and Pioneer engines.andM;The Monotype typesettersandM;Monotype's engines and RIPs are packaged together in a variety of completetypesetters and imagesetters.andP;  In most cases, they are driven by a variety offront-ends, most of which are made by companies other than Monotype.andM;Monotype 512.andP;  Monotype's typesetters are, with one exception, laser-basedunits.andP;  This one exception is the small Monotype 512 desktop typesetter,which is mainly sold in the Middle and Far Eastern markets.andP;  It uses atechnology unique to Monotype in the typesetting area, called a light gatearray, a special chip with 512 addressable light-switching elements.andP;  Thisarray is mounted on a carrier together with its green fluorescent lightsource, and it is aimed through a simple lens that focuses the 512 elementsdown into a 32-point-high area.andM;The Monotype 512 uses the Chelgraph Modular RIP, which is mounted within theunit, and it is driven from an Olivetti PC, which runs the compositionprogram and holds all the fonts that are downloaded into the RIP.andP;  Thistypesetter is availabel in 45- and 72-pica versions.andM;Prism.andP;  Prism is Monotype's 72-pica laser-diode typesetter with resolutionsswitchable between 600 and 2,400 dpi.andP;  The unit is available with the Series3 RIP or with the Adobe PostScript RIP, in which case it is sold as the PrismPS.andP;  It can also be sold with both RIPs and with Monotype's RIP Switch andIntegrator product built into the separate PostScript RIP cabinet.andP;  The Prismis designed to compete against the Linotronic 200P Model B, but it offers ahigher resolution and Monotype claims a better film handling system.andP;  It ispriced between the Linotronic 200P Model B and Linotronic 300 units.andM;We are impressed with the way that Monotype has integrated the PostScriptmachine into the Apple environment.andP;  Monotype sells a Macintosh deskaccessory to control all setup and maintenance of the Prism and itsPostScript RIP from the screen of a Macintosh SE or II on the AppleTalknetwork.andP;  The control panel of the unit is also well planned; it serves forboth the Series 3 and PostScript units.andP;  The panel indicates the amounts ofmaterial in both the input and take-up cassettes, whether the material ismoving, which input channel is being used, the laser exposure setting and theoperational mode.andM;Lasercomp 70i and 100i.andP;  The Lasercomp 70i and 100i are the only units thatare to be sold with the Series 1 RIP, and the imaging units are not as fastand accurate as the Express, nor are they as high-resolution or as accurateas the Pioneer.andP;  These, however, are the units in use at most Monotypeinstallations worldwide.andP;  They will continue to be sold because they will bepriced lower than the Express or Pioneer.andP;  Also, in certain parts of theworld, mainly the Comecon countries of Eastern Europe but also in the Middleand Far East and Africa, there may be technology limitations on selling theSeries 3 products.andP;  It will also be necessary for some markets to use theseLasercomps until all the Monotype fonts are converted to Qubic format.andM;Express Series 3.andP;  The Express Series 3 is Monotype's new performanceflagship typesetter, and it represents Monotype's bid to be once more thespeed king of the newspaper market.andP;  As such, it replaces the Series 1, whichhas lately been outmatched by the highest-speed Autologic APS-6 units.andP;  TheExpress Series 3 has an imaging speed of 30 inches a minute, six inches aminute faster than the APS-6, and the new Series 3 RIP appears able to keepup with this rate while running concurrent input and output.andM;The Express Series 3 is available in three output widths--82, 100 and 108picas--with a resolution of 1,000 dpi.andP;  It can be linked with a PostScriptRIP in the same fashion as the Prism so that PostScript data can be settogether with non-PostScript data.andP;  It can screen halftone images on the flyduring output at screens of up to 100 lines.andP;  By September, the Monotypecolor screening board will also be available for the unit, allowing fourcolor separations to be screened at up to a 100-line screen.andM;Pioneer Series 3.andP;  Pioneer is the high-resolution imagesetter that uses muchof the same optical system and film handling system as the Express.andP;  It isavailable in both 1,500- and 1,000-dpi resolutions.andP;  This is not as high asthe Prism, which goes to 2,400 dpi, but the use of a helium-neon laser with aprecisely controlled imaging spot, and the highly accurate film transport,make it more suitable for the highest-quality work.andM;The Pioneer is available in 72- and 108-pica widths, and starting in July itwill be shipped with the Series 3 RIP.andP;  The operating speeds of the unit are10 inches a minute at 1,500 dpi and 15 inches a minute at 1,000 dpi.andP;  Itdiffers from the Express in that the polygon spins at only 3,000 rpm insteadof 6,000, thus giving more time for the spot to image the material.andP;  ThePioneer is the unit currently being used for color at L'Express, but it isused there with the Series 1 RIP.andM;Series II Graphic SystemandM;Monotype probably has more typesetters operating in the newspaper marketsetting pages with graphics than any otherandM;typesetting supplier, and many of these customers use a Monotype GraphicSystem.andP;  The first Monotype Graphic System was a very simple evolution of thegraphics input software developed initially on the Lasercomp to support inputof graphics from an ECRM Autokon.andP;  This developed into a separate system witha simple graphics editing terminal where one could perform cropping and tonaladjustments on an image.andM;Later, a separate graphics management system was added for sharing graphicsamong a number of Lasercomp typesetters.andP;  This larger graphic system ran onthe computer Automation LSI4 computer, as used in the Series 1 RIP.andP;  It couldalso generate low-resolution view files and send them to a front-end systemfor page assembly.andP;  This operation was used particularly with Hastech,Xenotron and Harris page makeup terminals.andM;At ANPA last year Monotype introduced its Series II Graphic System, a totallynew development running on a Sun--4 workstation that replaces Monotype'searlier system.andP;  When we reviewed the product at ANPA and later at IPEX inthe same year, its speed impressed us, but we felt it lacked one essentialfunction to be a usable tool.andP;  That function was the ability to transferlow-resolution images to a page or display ad makeup system (which it coulddo), and then receive the images back from the system and apply the changesto the high-resolution data.andM;The new host system interface is now available.andP;  It allows a front-end,pagination or display ad system to access the Series II Graphic System forpicture directory information, to call for low-resolution images, and to sendcommands to crop, scale and rotate high-resolution images.andP;  The user candefine whether to update the image or a copy of the image.andP;  The interfacealso supports the picture fetch command from the Monotype RIP (Series 1 or 3)within the slave command language to pull an image from the Series II GraphicSystem over the 16-bit parallel interface and directly set it with theLasercomp, Express, Pioneer or Prism.andM;Monotype has developed a new 16-bit bus to allow multiple typesetters to runon the same high-speed interface.andP;  This is particularly important to enablethe Series II Graphic System to run on a smaller Sun platform than that onwhich it was originally shown, which was a Sun--4/260.andP;  It now runs on aSun--4/110, 4/150, or Sparcstation 330, using one VME card slot to connectvia the special interface to typesetters and scanners.andP;  In the future it maybe possible to interface to other devices by the SCSI port as well.andM;The 4/110, 4/150 or Sparcstation 330 may serve dual roles as graphics fileserver or database manager as well as graphics editing workstation.andO;Alternatively, one can use one of these workstations as the central filemanager and database, then add graphics editing terminals using Sun--3/80units with GX accelerated graphics.andP;  Monotype is also planning to add fulldatabase management tools based on off-the-shelf software that runs on Sunhardware.andM;Color from the Series II.andP;  At IPEX Monotype emphasized its move towards colorthrough its color screening board for the Express and Pioneer typesetters.andO;It also showed how the Series II Graphic System will move more toward being anon-retouching color system.andP;  At IPEX this was shown initially through aconnection from the new Itek 310-I input-only color scanner directly into theSeries II Graphic System via a VME interface card.andP;  The four colorseparations were being scanned in as contone images.andP;  The user saw an imageon the screen as monochrome by viewing the cyan separation.andP;  Any cropping,scaling or rotation that was required was carried out on the cyan separation,and then these transformations were applied to the other three separations.andM;Recently, at the Graphitec exhibition in Paris, we saw a further iteration onthis theme from the Monotype French subsidiary, S.A.andP;  Monotype.andP;  It used aPC-based graphic system with a Targa board running with a Howtek scanner andLumena Plus software to scan images and create four-color separations ofcontinuous-tone images.andP;  These were then passed to the Series II GraphicSystem and handled in the same fashion as the Itek data was at IPEX, beforebeing output to a Monotype Express with the color screening board.andP;  (See theGraphitec article in this issue for more detail.)andM;The next enhancement will be a full 24-bit color screen for the currentSeries II Graphic System.andP;  Already, the system supports a number of scanners,both monochrome and color.andP;  Input formats include monochrome PostScript files(via the Integrator function or Monotype PostScript-compatible software) orTIFF images over the Ethernet network, as is being done by the largestSwedish newspaper, Dagens Nyheter, in Stockholm.andP;  Monotype plans to supportColor PostScript and color TIFF formats in the future.andM;One other area of development within graphics is linking the Series IIGraphic System with the Monotype Picture Post, the electronic picture deskproduct for newspaper wire service images.andP;  The Picture Post, which is one ofthe European market leaders in its area, is currently capable of sendingimages to the Graphic System.andP;  It has a new interface to the Apple Macintosh;it can now send images to a Macintosh, from which they can be manipulated byprograms such as Image Studio or Digital Darkroom before being made up intopages for output.andM;MonoText: Serving commercial clientsandM;Over the years, the typesetting market has turned completely around.andP;  In thedays of hot metal--and indeed in the early days of photocomposition--thenewspaper market, which could accept a lower quality of typesetting, tendedto use Linotype equipment, whereas most companies needing higher-qualitytypesetting used Monotype.andP;  These days we see a different situation: a largeshare of Monotype's market is in newspapers, while Linotype (apart from itsdesktop publishing products) sells predominantly into the commercial markets.andO;Monotype does sell many machines outside of the newspaper area, but it is notconsidered a major supplier among the quality typesetting houses.andM;Monotype has just announced a new operation that is intended to reestablishit as a force among companies that demand high-quality typesetting.andP;  This newcompany, MonoText, is a joint venture with the leading Swedish tradetypesetting company, TextData AB.andP;  TextData has established its leadingposition in just three years by using a unique approach that MonoText plansto follow in other countries.andM;TextData: adding typographic quality.andP;  To describe what MonoText will offer,we must explain TextData's operation.andP;  TextData is a highly unusualtypesetting service organization.andP;  When we were asked to look at TextDatalast year, our first comment was: &quot;How can a company using Monotype Lasercompequipment and fonts compete successfully against Berthold, Scangraphic andLinotype in the markets that are looking for the highest quality oftypography, not only in typefaces, but also in text make-up?&quot;andP;  We found thatTextData had succeeded by providing the best typography built around thequality of Monotype's typefaces.andM;To do this, TextData developed the most extensive set of kerning, tracking,and wordspace tracking tables that we had ever seen: for every font, aminimum of 2,500 kerning pairs per font, and in some cases almost 6,000.andP;  Inaddition, there are seven levels of character space tracking and five levelsof wordspace tracking, in which the user defines the point size breaks wheretracking changes occur.andP;  There are also quality improvements and additionsmade to the ligatures and special characters.andM;The extensive detailed work that TextData puts into developing its kerningtables is impressive.andP;  It sets a very wide range of kerning pairs on itsLasercomps, initially with values created from another font.andP;  Typographerslook at the Lasercomp output of more than 6,000 of these pairs; they assessevery single pairing to see whether kerning is needed, and they check how itshould be adjusted for optimum fit.andP;  This process goes through a number ofsetting stages until the right values are obtained.andP;  The typographers alsolook at different sizes to define the tracking values.andP;  Customers can modifythese values and add to them.andM;TextData has also digitized a number of its own characters to add specificones into fonts that lack them; certain fonts lacked true small caps, forexample.andP;  With the Series 3, they will have to be digitized initially byMonotype Typography.andM;The painstaking process of producing 2,500 to 6,000 kern pairs per font takesmuch longer than what might be called &quot;mass-production kerning,&quot; in which thefont supplier includes about 400 standard kern pairs (if any) with a font.andO;TextData has kerned around 300 fonts so far in three years, and it claims tohave spent around 15,000 man-hours in this operation.andM;The service structure.andP;  The next difference is the manner in which TextDataworks with its customers.andP;  Each customer is supplied with a terminal on whichit makes up complete jobs in a WYSIWYG mode.andP;  When completed, the data issent via modem to one of TextData's three production centers in Sweden.andP;  Thejob is typeset, and TextData's contractual commitment is to get the typesetcopy back to the customer within one hour.andM;The customers include six of the ten largest ad agencies in Sweden, manypublishers, designers, studios, and other firms.andP;  There are more than 70TextData terminals in customer sites.andM;The concept behind MonoText is to take this structure into all the importantquality typesetting markets in Europe and the U.S.andP;  Key organizations in eacharea will act as service centers, with customers having MonoText terminalslinked into the service center via modem.andP;  The master franchise for the UKand Ireland has already been agreed upon, as we'll discuss in a minute.andM;Hardware and software.andP;  MonoText will have central production operations towhich creative organizations will send data from the MonoText terminals.andP;  Tobe attractive, the terminals need a very high standard of typography and apowerful, friendly user interface.andP;  The terminals now sold by TextData inSweden are Xenotron XVC2 units, with their software extensively modified byTextData.andP;  Because there was no way this concept would be successful in theinternational market, a new terminal and software were sought.andM;The result of this search is the terminal to be sold by MonoText: an80386-based PC running modified 3B2 software from Advent in the UK.andP;  The makeof PC may differ in each country, but each will have the same display.andP;  Themonitor will be either a Sigma LaserView (or equivalent) for monochrome or aHitachi for color; it will use a QPDM display card with a 1280 X 1024resolution.andP;  There will also be a recommended laser printer--a Canon SX-basedunit--and recommended graphic scanners.andM;The Advent 3B2 software is a package we have admired since we first saw it alittle over a year ago.andP;  We will soon conduct an in-depth review of thesecond software release.andP;  It is one of the few systems in the world to have atrue WYSIWYG display where the screen fonts are created in real time from theoutline font masters.andP;  One of the most powerful macro-based compositionlanguages we have seen enables a sophisticated user to set 3B2 up to handlecomposition in exactly the manner desired.andM;To this basic functionality, MonoText has added full TextData kerning,tracking, wordspace tracking, and ligature and small capital generation tomake a very comprehensive true WYSIWYG composition, graphics and page makeupterminal.andP;  For proofing, the user can add a laser printer that uses exactlythe same fonts as drive the screen.andM;We have not seen the final MonoText system yet, but we are told that with thetypography shown on the screen, the effect is nearly like real typesetting onthe screen--or, as one MonoText executive said, it is like DisplayPostScript, with real typesetting quality.andM;The MonoText terminal, as installed in a customer site for input to aproduction site, will be limited to outputting on the laser printer.andP;  Theproduction site to which it will connect via a modern (installed as a cardwithin the PC chassis) will run Monotype typesetters equipped with the newSeries 3 RIP.andP;  These will mainly be 108-pica 1,500-dpi Pioneers.andP;  The widemeasure is a benefit in this market for setting wide spreads.andP;  The system islimited to driving Series 3 RIP machines, meaning Pioneer, Express S3 andPrism.andP;  Prism is seen as having too narrow a measure, and it also may be tooslow for a high-throughput service operation.andM;MonoText: structure and future.andP;  Monotype has a 55 percent share of theMonoText operation; TextData, 45 percent.andP;  The chief executive will be SvenMalmgren, who has been chief executive of TextData and is responsible for itsgrowth.andP;  Peter Reichel, who has been responsible for the technical andtypographic development of TextData, is technical director.andP;  The Monotyperepresentatives are Rene Kerfante, its director of typography, and Uwe Rumpf,managing director of Monotype Germany.andP;  Germany is seen as a major potentialmarket for MonoText.andM;This system brings the Monotype typography into the quality markets where itis appreciated.andP;  The output samples we have seen from the earlier TextDatasystem are the best we have seen from any Monotype Lasercomp typesetter, andas good as anything from other suppliers.andP;  We look forward to seeing theoutput from the Series 3 Monotype Pioneer, where we believe the Qubic fontsand the higher resolution will give even better quality than before.andM;The first franchisee.andP;  To assess how this could all work we spoke with GarryWasher, chairman of Ad Make-Up Network, the largest independent tradetypesetting and computer graphics operation in the UK.andP;  Ad Make-Up Networkruns a large trade typesetting operation using Linotronic equipment (with thetotal Linotype font library), which replaced a second-generation Bertholdsystem.andP;  It also owns a desktop publishing service operation calledTechnotype, a large Dicomed-based slide producing company, and a range ofother graphics design and corporate image companies.andM;Ad Make-Up Network has become the exclusive MonoText franchise holder for theUK and Ireland.andP;  It also has major trade typesetting and graphics companiesin Paris and plans to open up with MonoText in France and Spain soon afterlaunching the product in the UK.andM;Before signing up with MonoText, Ad Make-Up Network carried out extensiveresearch on the market and the potential for this concept.andP;  It found that theprofessional market had experimented with desktop publishing and wasdisappointed with the quality it offered.andP;  Most of these organizations knewwhat quality they wanted but did not always understand what was necessary toachieve it.andP;  Garry Washer found that they did not realize the importance ofkerning and tracking in quality typesetting, and he equated this to antilockbraking on a car.andP;  You don't know you need it until you've used it, and thenyou don't want to live without it.andM;Ad Make-Up Network has set up TextData UK; its operations will commence inJuly.andP;  It has ordered a Monotype Pioneer typesetter and will install fourterminals plus communications facilities in its London base.andP;  Although ithasn't launched the system yet, it has had a great degree of interest bothfor terminals (for which it has already received customer orders) andsubfranchises.andP;  A subfranchise is where another organization can set up aproduction center and sell terminals to its customers to access its center.andM;The TextData UK initial production center is planned to be accessed by 20terminals by the end of 1989.andP;  TextData UK will avoid quick expansion so asto ensure the highest level of service.andP;  It is guaranteeing a one-hourturnaround from the receipt of data to the return of made-up film or paper.andM;The center will also handle graphics from its Autokon with a SCSI interfacebox.andP;  Customers may include graphics in a page from their 300-dpi scanners,but in the initial stages they will serve only as a guide for incorporationof the high-resolution graphic.andP;  TextData UK may well look at incorporatingthe latest version of the Monotype Series II Graphic System to provide ahigh-resolution graphics scanning service, from which customers would be ableto call low-resolution views files to include in their pages.andP;  Thehigh-resolution file would then be added to the page at time of output.andM;MonoText has not yet defined its support for PostScript.andP;  We understand,however, that Encapsulated PostScript is likely to be handled on the terminalscreen, and the production centers will probably have PostScript RIPcapability in addition to Series 3 RIP capability.andP;  This would enablePostScript data to be included in the page.andM;TextData UK is targeting three types of customers, in addition to sellingsubfranchises.andP;  The first of these are professional studios, ad agencies anddesign houses.andP;  The second are publishers that are looking for high-qualitypaged output; there already have been a number of inquiries from this area.andO;The third are direct clients with an inhouse graphics facility.andP;  Thisincludes organizations, such as accountancy firms, that are moving more intoproducing reports and accounts and other quality image-making financialpublications.andM;Gary Washer is very positive about the potential of MonoText and TextData UK.andO;He said that using a conventional professional typesetting company is likegoing down to the pub for a beer; using desktop publishing is like having ahome brewing kit to make your own beer; and using TextData is like having abeer pump in your home, with a pipe directly connected to your favoritebrewery.andM;Pricing.andP;  TextData UK has established the following pricing for its clients.andO;The terminals sold to customers will be Olivetti M380 units with a 25-MHz80386 processor, 4 MB of RAM and a 150-MB disk.andP;  They will be sold at theOlivetti list price of 7,122 pounds ($11,400).andP;  Different systems areavailable, subject to suitability and to TextData UK's ability to act as adealer.andP;  The screen will use the QPDM 1280 X 1024 controller with either a20-inch Hitachi color monitor at 5,180 pounds ($8,300) or the Flexscan20-inch monochrome monitor at 2,500 pounds ($4,000).andP;  The firm is alsowilling to sell just the software and fonts, but in this case the level ofsupport will be lower.andM;The full software package with all kerning and tracking controls is 4,500pounds ($7,200).andP;  This includes five days of training, plus three days ofcontinuing support.andP;  The prices for the fonts that drive the screen and thelaser printer, and that correspond to the fonts at the production center,depend on the number of fonts purchased.andP;  For fewer than 100, the price is 54pounds ($86) per font; for 100 to 200, it is 43.20 pounds ($69) per font; andfor more than 200, it is 37.80 pounds ($60) per font.andP;  Initially, more than300 fonts with the total kerning information will be available; this isguaranteed to be increased by at least 100 per year.andP;  The cost of output onbromide paper is 0.50 pounds ($.80) per cm.andM;TextData UK will develop a full range of customer support material: specificfont books, casting off tables, setting examples, etc.andP;  These will be basedupon materials developed in Sweden, which are of a very high quality.andM;Monotype TypographyandM;One of Monotype's long-term strengths and major assets is its typography.andP;  Ithas been a driving force in typography since before the 1920s, but in thatperiod and the 1930s Monotype was the major typographic influence in theworld.andP;  In that time the renowned Stanley Morrison and others produced arange of famous typefaces, the best known of which is the world's mostpopular typeface, Times New Roman.andP;  The range of typefaces coming fromMonotype dwindled in later years; one could say at that time the company wasliving on its typographic reputation.andM;In recent years that philosophy has changed and Monotype's type subsidiary isagain a force in typographic developments and the introduction of newtypefaces.andP;  It was one of the first companies to realize the importance oftypography outside of its traditional areas, and it pulled off a major coupin the early 1980s by becoming the supplier of typography to IBM for its 4250and 3800 ranges of printers.andP;  It is also a supplier of digital type to manyother organizations.andM;Monotype Typography is now a licensed user of the Adobe typographic tools andcan make PostScript fonts in Type 1 format.andP;  THe first of these faces will beavailable in September.andP;  However, Monotype already has a wide range of itstypography available in Type 3 format.andP;  Monotype Typography has announcedsupport for the Sun Folio F3 font format and will be supplying fonts in thisformat soon.andP;  Other parts of Monotype are also planning to use these fonts intheir systems, both for screen and output imaging.andP;  Most recently, MonotypeTypography announced that it will support the new Apple Royal format.andM;Other Monotype companiesandM;Monotype has a number of subsidiary or associate companies in the prepressand other fields.andP;  Some of these are historical sales subsidiaries, butothers were acquired within the past five years.andP;  Monotype allows most ofthese companies to be run on an independent basis.andP;  In many cases Monotype asa typesetter supplier distances itself in a sales environment from itssubsidiaries, and its subsidiary companies similarly distance themselves fromtheir parent.andP;  For example, GB Techniques' products are sold through totallydifferent sales channels, and it often sells non-Monotype typesetters.andM;* GB Techniques, the leading supplier of PC-based newspaper systems in theUK, is 100% owned by Monotype.andM;* Graphic Systems is one of the leading suppliers to French commercialtypesetting markets, using PC-based systems.andM;* Intertec Electronics manufactures Picture Post electronic picture systemsfor wirephotos.andM;Monotype is spinning off this aspect of the company, leaving Intertec free toconcentrate on specialized data communications systems.andP;  This split is anindication of how Monotype is building a substantial base of communicationsexpertise among its subsidiaries.andM;* Commandercom, in which Monotype has a 47 percent stake, is a specialistdevelopment company working on digital switching in all forms ofcommunications systems.andM;* Monotype Easydata is another company working in communications,specializing in diagnostic techniques for transmissions systems.andM;* Sinclair Communications UK, of which Monotype owns 60 percent, is in thecommunications market, with wirephoto and other digital and analogtransmission systems.andM;* Monotype has a minority interest in Highwater Design, the small,Cheltenham-based Randamp;D company that is involved in development of the Series IIGraphic System.andM;The global outlook.andP;  Monotype also has wholly or partly owned subsidiaries inAustralia, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, France, Germany, Holland, Hong Kong,India, Japan, Malaysia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Portugal, Singapore, Spain,Switzerland and the U.S.andP;  It also has agents and distributors covering mostother parts of the world.andM;Many analysts see a wholly owned distribution operation as one of Monotype'smajor strengths.andP;  However, this area has also been one of its limitations,because many of these subsidiaries are very small and lack people whounderstand some of the markets in which Monotype is now a player.andP;  Some ofthe subsidiaries, such as Monotype France, have been very successful inselling Lasercomps, whereas others have failed to make a major impression oncertain key markets.andM;Some of today's problems can be traced back to Monotype's undercapitalizationin the 1970s, when many subsidiary companies found it a real strain tomaintain their business while their competitors were expanding.andP;  For thefuture, though, Monotype's ownership of its distribution channel is a majorasset, particularly in the Middle and Far East markets, which will becomemore significant with the ongoing growth of typesetting there.andM;ConclusionandM;These days, few companies with almost 100 years of commitment to one industrycan still claim to be technological leaders in that industry.andP;  In theprepress market there are two such companies: Linotype and Monotype.andM;Linotype has been going from strength to strength in past years, and it isthe one company whose position has been substantially enhanced by the desktoppublishing revolution and PostScript.andP;  As a manufacturer of laserimagesetters it was a latecomer to the party compared to Monotype, but it hasrapidly become the world's leading supplier in terms of installed deviceswith total sales of around 10,000 units, whereas Monotype has sold fewer than2,000.andP;  In terms of financial performance, Linotype has become the mostsuccessful company in the monochrome prepress industry, with an annualturnover some five times that of the Monotype Corporation and approaching theoverall size of Compugraphic.andM;Monotype, however, has been moving steadily ahead since it sorted out itsfunding in the early 1980s, and it has capitalized well on its ability toprovide the newspaper markets with sufficient speed and functionality.andP;  Ithas also addressed many market areas apart from newspapers, and it has builta strong international position in many markets where we expect continuinggrowth in demand for prepress systems that can handle their specific needs.andM;Monotype has benefited from Autologic's failure for years to supply asuitable upgrade path for its APS--5 customers.andP;  Many of those that could notwait switched to Monotype.andP;  Now that the APS--6 is finally delivering theperformance and functionality that Autologic customers were looking for,Monotype's position in the U.S.andP;  market is becoming more difficult.andP;  It iscountering with its new wave of products.andM;Products: a rosy future?andP;  With the Series 3 Express and the forthcomingSeries 3 Pioneer, it appears that Monotype has once again produced units thatare well-suited to the perceived price/performance and functionality needs ofthe U.S.andP;  and lager worldwide newspapers.andP;  The completion of the Series IIGraphic System as a real system for the needs of newspapers adds to thestrength of the output products, as do its PostScript links.andP;  THis new systemappears to be an impressive technical achievement, the more so because it isout of the lab and in customer sites.andP;  Customers with Series 3 units inproduction tell us that the units live up to the claims made of them.andM;Monotype has worked as well on being seen as a supporter of desktop-levelsystems.andP;  While it was not the first company to support PostScript, webelieve it was the first company to support Apple's QuickDraw for running atypesetter with its Macintosh software to convert QuickDraw into the Monotypeslave language.andP;  We understand Monotype has plans to become much more of asystem integrator in the future in this area, with PostScript and its ownlanguage.andP;  Products to be announced later this year will emphasize itsposition in this area.andM;MonoText is also an area of business we find interesting and progressive.andO;Monotype sees a way to reestablish its position as a leader in the qualitytypesetter market through a unique franchising operation that will not add toits distribution channel costs, but that if successful will do much toenhance the company's reputation.andP;  The approach may antagonize commercialtypesetting firms that are not franchisees, but Monotype probably reasonsthat these firms are not Monotype customers anyway.andP;  This shows that thecompany is planning to support different levels of the market, admittedlyprobably more niche than mainstream markets, so as to provide what thesemarkets ideally require.andP;  In short, it is backing a number of horses.andM;The good and the bad.andP;  Do we have reservations?andP;  Yes.andP;  Technical achievementsare fine, but they must be sold to customers.andP;  We have doubts aboutMonotype's ability to sell into all market areas, particularly in the area ofPostScript, where it is competing with much larger and richer firms inselling somewhat similar products.andM;In the key U.S.andP;  market, we have seen Monotype's structure change recently,with a number of its senior key executives and sales staff members leavingthe company; in the past year, there have been a new chairman, president andvice president of sales, plus many different salesmen, including some joiningshortly before ANPA.andP;  We wonder whether the market either understands or hasconfidence in the current sales and support structure.andP;  We have said that theU.S.andP;  generated around 20 percent of Monotype's revenue in 1987.andP;  However, weunderstand that the U.S.andP;  generated a much higher percentage of the profitsthan 20 percent.andP;  It is therefore important for Monotype that its operationin the U.S.andP;  be successful with the Series 3 products.andP;  We understand recentsales have been below expectations, while, at the same time, Autologic hasbeen increasing its sales.andM;We also are not sure about the long-term position of typesetter driverlanguages other than standard languages such as PostScript.andP;  As long as thereis a substantial performance difference between Monotype's command languageand PostScript, Monotype has a good case for its proprietary language.andO;However, we expect that performance gap to continue to narrow significantlyin coming years.andM;Will newspapers simply wait for a PostScript of sufficient performance, orwill they be happy with configurations where two imaging models run into thesame unit, as with the Series 3 or Autologic typesetters today?andP;  We believethat Monotype's plan to support the Sun Folio F3 font format in the Series 3units could be advantageous.andP;  It would give the typesetter access to the samefont libraries as Adobe, and thus it would provide much of the fontcompatibility one gets from PostScript.andP;  At least all the major newspaperfront-end systems support the Monotype slave language, and some also supportworking with the low-resolution images generated by the Monotype GraphicSystem.andM;Monotype's move to support color is one of the strong points of its newsystems.andP;  The world will be looking for units that can handle color for thenewspaper and magazine markets quickly and at an acceptable price.andP;  From whatwe have seen at L'Express in Paris it appears that Monotype has a real chancein this area, since most other organizations are backing PostScript forcolor, and since it currently faces problems in performance.andP;  Admittedly,Monotype may be backing two horses, but it does appear that the Series3/Express and Pioneer units offer acceptable quality and speed to beattractive alternatives.andM;What's ahead?andP;  Monotype enters the '90s with a new look.andP;  It will beoperating by the end of 1989 from its new modern offices and factory, whichreplace its sad old site that dated back to the successful times of hotmetal.andP;  Will it be a healthy, profitable company as it approaches its 100thbirthday?andP;  Although it has taken a beating financially over the past 18months, we believe that its product line is now appreciably stronger than ithas been in some time.andM;The company has tried in recent years to turn itself into more of a totalsystem supplier.andP;  This effort has left it with an interesting collection ofcompanies, investments and technologies.andP;  But we think that Monotype's realfuture will be determined by its success in its core output imaging business.andO;Here, we think that recent developments--including the Series 3 RIP, supportfor PostScript, the Prism and the forays into color output--have beenencouaraging.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
