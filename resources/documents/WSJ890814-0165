The parties reached a settlement Friday, minutes before a jury verdict was reached awarding $40 million to the farmers and nothing to Chubb. Under the settlement, Chubb will receive about $3.7 million and the farmers a total of $4.3 million, a Chubb attorney said.    The jury had decided to award the farmers $20 million in compensatory damages for negligent misrepresentation and $20 million in punitive damages, said Stanley Chesley, an attorney for the farmers. &quot;It wouldn't have made any difference,&quot; Mr. Chesley declared. &quot;All they could collect was $8 million.&quot;    The settlement, which supersedes the jury verdict, will be paid by Fireman's Fund Corp., which held a policy of errors and omissions insurance for Good Weather. Although Good Weather consented to an &quot;entry of judgment&quot; of $73 million, according to Mr. Sheehy, the Fireman's Fund policy had a liability limit of $8 million.    Good Weather &quot;had no other assets,&quot; and $8 million was the limit on the insurance policy it had, said John J. Sheehy, the attorney for Chubb. Mr. Sheehy said the $73 million entry of judgment allows Chubb and the farmers to collect if &quot;let's say we found Good Weather had an interest in an oil well. Then we'd seize that.&quot;    Mr. Sheehy said, &quot;Good Weather exists, but they're just barely surviving.&quot; The attorney said he didn't know whether Good Weather was still writing crop insurance, but he said &quot;one thing you can be sure of {is that Chubb} will not be writing this kind of insurance&quot; any more. Chubb and the 8,800 farmers in the class had sought about $77 million in damages from Good Weather. In addition, the farmers had sought $20 million plus punitive damages from the managing insurance agent, claiming the company oversold crop insurance before and during last summer's drought.    The dispute arose last summer when farmers, facing severe drought, applied for nearly $400 million in crop insurance when Chubb had planned to write only $40 million of coverage. The dispute moved into the courts after Chubb began telling farmers their applications hadn't been accepted. Chubb has asserted that Good Weather, acting as its agent, exceeded its authority in accepting a large volume of applications.    Last November, Chubb agreed to pay about $48 million to settle a suit by a group of farmers who were denied insurance against damage from last summer's drought. That settlement was eventually adjusted to about $55 million, attorneys said. According to Mr. Chesley, farmers who filed drought-related suits have received a total of about $81 million, including about $19 million in claims paid. </TEXT></DOC>
