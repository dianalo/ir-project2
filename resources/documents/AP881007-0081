One of the publications, the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa, alsosaid American hostages will be released before the U.S.presidential election on Nov. 8.   Both Ash-Shiraa and the conservative daily Al-Anwar citedunidentified informed sources for its report. There was no way toconfirm that Waite's release was imminent.   Al-Anwar said one of its sources reported that Waite ``has beenmoved from the Bekaa (valley) to Beirut's southern suburbs andpredicted he will be released in 72 hours.''   But the newspaper said another source claimed Waite, 48, will befreed after resumption of British-Syrian relations.   Ash-Shiraa, based in Moslem west Beirut, said Waite and twoother British hostages will be released ``very soon.''   The magazine said a recent decision for the restoration of fulldiplomatic relations between Britain and Iran ``provided a strongimpetus to efforts currently underway for the release of Waite andhis countrymen.''   Ash-Shiraa also quoted an unidentified informed security sourceas saying Monday's release of hostage Mithileshwar Singh, an Indiannational and legal resident alien of the United States, marked``the beginning of the release of ... American hostages.''   ``The source said American hostages would be released before theU.S. presidential election,'' the report added, without furtherelaboration.   Ash-Shiraa gained fame when it broke the story of secret U.S.arms sales to Iran in November 1986. But its recent reports on thehostages have not been accurate. Al-Anwar also has no record ofauthoritative reports on the hostages.   Singh was held by a pro-Iranian underground group calling itselfIslamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine. He was kidnappedJan. 24, 1987 from the U.S.-affiliated Beirut University Collegealong with American educators Alann Steen, Robert Polhill and JesseTurner.   London severed diplomatic relations with Damascus in November1986, after accusing the Syrian government of involvement in a plotto blow up an Israeli airliner at Heathrow airport. Syria deniedthe charge.   Syria, a strong ally of Iran, has said it was working for therelease of all hostages in Lebanon. Most of captives are held byShiite Moslem followers of Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.   Syria also is the main powerbroker in Lebanon. It has anestimated 40,000 troops in eastern and norther provinces as well aswest and south Beirut.   The fundamentalists who are believed to hold the foreigncaptives are entrenched in areas under Syrian control.   Waite disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his west Beiruthotel for a rendezvous with Islamic Jihad, or Holy War, which holdsAmerican hostages Terry Anderson, 40, and Thomas Sutherland, 56.   Anderson, of Lorain, Ohio, chief Middle East correspondent ofThe Associated Press, is the longest-held captive. He was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   In all 16 foreigners are missing in Lebanon, including nineAmericans.   Britain seeks the release of three of its nationals held bypro-Iranian Islamic fundamentalists _ Waite, journalist JohnMcCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan, a Belfast man with dual Britishand Irish nationality whose release is also sought by the Irishgovernment.   The Foreign Office says it also seeks word on Alec Collett, aNew York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors haveclaimed they killed him. His body was never found.</TEXT></DOC>
