Valentine, restating opposition voiced by Justice officials formore than a decade, said the department does not believe a link hasbeen proven between radiation and cancers in miners and peoplereceiving fallout from the atmospheric weapons tests.   ``The assumptions underlying this ill-conceived proposal areeither subject to serious dispute or demonstrably erroneous,'' saidValentine, adding that the department would recommend a veto oflegislation being pushed by lawmakers from Utah to compensatevictims or their survivors.   ``I am incredulous,'' responded Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.,chairman of the Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law andgovernment relations. Frank said radiation victim compensation``will be high on the (subcommittee's) agenda next year. It won'tgo away.''   Frank's hearing centered on bills introduced by Rep. WayneOwens, D-Utah, and Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, to pay compensationsimilar to what Congress has voted in recent years to militarypeople who participated in the tests and to Marshall Islandersinjured by U.S. nuclear tests in the Pacific.   Their proposal would give $50,000 each to people who lived in adesignated downwind area of Nevada, Utah and Arizona during theNevada tests and who developed cancers that studies show had a highprobability of being caused by the radiation.   Payments of $100,000 each would go to people who worked forminimum periods in underground uranium mines in Utah, Colorado, NewMexico and Arizona between 1949 and 1971 and who developed lungcancer and other respiratory problems.   The lawmakers say the legislation is needed because a U.S.appeals court has overturned a circuit court ruling that awardeddamages to some 1,200 downwind residents on grounds that thegovernment had failed to warn them of the tests' dangers.   Owens, who as a private attorney represented some of theplaintiffs, said that he also has had personal experience withhealth problems of former miners.   ``Last year, my brother-in-law died from lung cancer,'' Owenstestified. ``He worked in the Marysvale uranium mine in Utah forless than six months _ a healthy man who never smoked a singlecigarette in his life dies from lung cancer.''   Owens said payments to the miners are justified because thegovernment knew of high levels of radiation in the mines but failedto warn the miners or force the mine owners to install properventilating equipment.   ``The government demonstrated a reckless disregard for the livesof these uranium miners,'' he testified. ``The uranium minersbecame mere guinea pigs in a government death watch.''   Arden Higgins, who worked in the Marysvale mine from 1953 to1959, told the subcommittee that although he never smoked, he losthis right lung to cancer in 1983.   ``I've watched my partners and my friends die of lung cancer,''Higgins said. ``It seems that each year another one dies.''   He said federal inspectors took radioactivity readings in themine and that physicians tested the workers. ``They never mentionedonce what the radiation was doing to us,'' he said. ``They told uswe were all right.''</TEXT></DOC>
