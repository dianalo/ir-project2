The Die Welt newspaper of Bonn also said that ``no charges havebeen filed against the (second) American citizen, although he isstill in the Federal Republic.''   The man alleged to have led the ring, former U.S. Army Sgt.Clyde Lee Conrad, remained in prison today, facing espionagecharges carrying a maximum 10-year sentence.   Conrad allegedly paid another U.S. soldier ``a five-figure sum''for obtaining secret NATO information, according to chief WestGerman prosecutor Kurt Rebmann.   ``The information that led to the arrest of the allegedinternational spy ringleader, former U.S. Army Sgt. Clyde LeeConrad, apparently came from the U.S. Army soldier who wasrecruited by Conrad to provide information after Conrad left theservice in 1985,'' the conservative Die Welt said.   Although the West Germans say the second American was a soldierwhen he was recruited for espionage, the Washington Post quotedadministration sources as saying the man has since left the Army.   In Washington, a U.S. official said Friday that Conrad had a topsecret security clearance before leaving the U.S. Army.   The U.S. official also conceded that Conrad was never subjectedto a periodic follow-up investigation during the time he held thehigh-security clearance.   West German and U.S. news media reports have said the spy ringsold the Soviets secret documents about nuclear missile bases,military pipelines and NATO troop strength. Officials say the ringstarted operating in the late 1970s.   According to a report Friday night on CBS News, the 41-year-oldConrad collected more than $1 million for peddling the secrets.   CBS attributed the report to a West German newspaper that it didnot identify.   West German investigators have said they believe Conrad kept themoney in numbered Swiss bank accounts.</TEXT></DOC>
