The agency said it ``got what we wanted'' in a long battle withthe Office of Management and Budget over cleanup standards.   Superfund provides money for cleanups only for sites that theprogram has placed on a ``national priority list,'' currentlycontaining 1,175 sites out of 30,013 possible. Such a listing alsoqualifies communities for federal health studies and grants tocommunity groups and local governments to pay for theirparticipation in site discussions.   States contribute 10 percent to cleanup costs, direct manycleanups under EPA oversight, and sometimes clean up sites thatnever make the federal program at all. Companies responsible fordisposal of the waste in the first place also are handling manycleanups.   EPA's proposed regulations would permit the agency not to listsites if a state petitions to handle the cleanup on its own.   ``EPA recognizes that many more sites need to be addressed thanpresent (superfund) resources can accommodate; by deferring someproblem sites to the states, EPA believes more overall responseactions can be accomplished more quickly, and EPA can direct itsresources to sites that would otherwise not be addressed,'' thedraft regulation said.   Agreements with polluting companies to clean up sites and not putthem on the priority list ``may facilitate EPA efforts toexpeditiously obtain such enforcement agreements,'' it said.   EPA still would specify the details of the cleanup if the agencyagreed with a polluter to keep the site off the list, it said.   A state might want to keep a site off the Superfund priority listin the belief that it could get a cleanup finished much more quicklythan EPA's cumbersome procedures would allow. It wouldn't losefederal funds if the company responsible had agreed to pay for thecleanup.   A company has an obvious incentive to keep sites off the list _avoidance of publicity.   J. Winston Porter, EPA's assistant administrator for solid wasteand emergency response, said he believed it would be difficult for astate to get full responsibility for a site if its cleanup standardswere not as strict as EPA's.   In New York, David Strait, superfund specialist for the NaturalResources Defense Council, said ``It's just outrageous'' for EPA topropose ways to give polluters more control over cleanups and leavelocal communities without financial assistance by keeping sites offthe priority list.   The document also proposes extensive revisions to the numericalsystem by which EPA assesses the seriousness of toxic waste sites.The changes would permit threats to the environment, chronic healththreats and potential threats such as accumulation of a contaminantin the food chain to be considered.   EPA was required by 1986 amendments to the superfund law topublish new final regulations by April 1988, which would have meantpublishing a draft in April 1987, Porter said.   The statutory requirement for ``having (the draft) out in sixmonths made interesting reading but it just couldn't be done,''Porter said.   The 769-page, four-pound document will attract ``tons ofcomment,'' and will be adopted in about a year, Porter said. Thelast revision took almost three years from publication to adoption,from 1982 to 1985.   If there are no other applicable regulations on cancer-causingchemicals at the site, EPA proposes to aim at cleanups that willleave nearby residents with no more than a one in 10 million to onein 10,000 chance of getting cancer.   OMB had sought to limit the lower end of this range to one in amillion instead of one in 10 million. Some court decisions and otherprograms in EPA and other agencies have used one in a million as thecutoff below which risks may be ignored.   Porter said OMB had a ``legitimate question'' but EPA believed``it would send a terrible message'' to adopt OMB's position becausethe agency already was using the standard.   OMB's dispute with EPA lasted four months, and Rep. John Dingell,D-Mich., chairman of the investigations subcommittee of the HouseEnergy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement thatPresident-elect George Bush could show his commitment toenvironmental protection by ``preventing OMB from interfering in thefuture.''   An aide in OMB's press office said she would ask if any officialswanted to reply to Dingell, but no one had responded by Thursdayevening.</TEXT></DOC>
