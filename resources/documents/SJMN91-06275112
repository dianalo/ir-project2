To appreciate this, you need somebackground.;   About six years ago, Seghieri, then a 37-year-old sheet metalworker, and some biker buddies were having a late-night discussion over somebeers.;   &quot;I said something like: 'I'm tired of doing what I've been doing,' &quot;he recalled. &quot;One of the guys suggested opening a motorcycle parts store. Thelight bulb went off.;   &quot;We started kicking around names. Way into the night,someone came up with 'The Hog Farm.';   &quot;Since we were all riding Harleys (asin Harley-Davidson motorcycles) and since Harleys were pretty much known asthe classic 'Hogs,' it seemed right,&quot; he said.;   To appreciate thesignificance of this revelation, you need a bit more background.;  Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson has been making motorcycles for 87 years. Atthe end of World War II, when returning soldiers were buying them because theywere cheap, Harleys were likened to garbage scows -- fat, low to the ground,exhaust belchers -- &quot;Hogs.&quot;;   IT'S IMPORTANT to keep that historical tidbitin mind because the Harley lawyers are building their case against Seghieriaround it.;   Anyway, Seghieri borrowed some money and leased a brick buildingat Montgomery and West San Carlos streets near downtown San Jose.;   Hespecialized in Harley parts. He hired reliable mechanics and put in a fewdecor options -- chrome accessories, leather jackets, raunchy T-shirts, etc.;  Within a couple of years, &quot;The Hog Farm&quot; became San Jose's most popularHarley parts store. Last year, it grossed about $1 million.;   By comparison,Harley-Davidson had $600 million in bike and parts sales worldwide last year.That's muscle.;   Now the giant bike builder is trying to muscle Seghieri outof business because The Hog Farm is not one of 600 official Harley dealers.The official Harley dealer, Golden State Harley-Davidson, is about 150 yardsdown the road on West San Carlos Street.;   Harley-Davidson says Seghieri isripping off not only its good name but also the name &quot;Hog,&quot; which, thecompany's lawyers have pointed out in federal court, is a registeredHarley-Davidson trademark.;   &quot;It's not that we have anything against Mr.Seghieri; we just do not want the word 'Hog' or even 'H-A-W-G' to be usednegatively or to become generic, like aspirin,&quot; said Bill Wood,Harley-Davidson's manager of trademark enforcement.;   HE TOOK great pains tosound polite on the phone. But I got the picture.;   &quot;I can't tell you howmany victories we've had or who they were,&quot; Wood said, &quot;because most of thosepeople backed down and settled out of court.&quot;;   Sounds pretty intimidating.;  &quot;They've got the money,&quot; said Seghieri. &quot;They're trying to wear me down.&quot;;  But he's got his own lawyers. And he said he'll fight.;   You've got to admirehim -- the little guy standing up to the self-righteous bully -- especiallywhen the cause is bigger than business.;   It's language.;   In Germany,Harley-Davidson's biggest foreign market, it's the word &quot;schwein.&quot; In France,it's &quot;cochon.&quot; In Italy, it's &quot;porco.&quot; In Japan, it's &quot;buta.&quot;;   &quot;We do notintend to go after foreign derivations, regardless of the markets,&quot; Wood said.&quot;We're only interested in the American word 'Hog.' &quot;;   Somehow, that's notreassuring. Harley-Davidson's claim on the word still sounds greedy. It oughtto be challenged.;   A little San Jose business could be the place to draw theline.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Pat Dillon column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911001  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  590  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, October 1, 199100275112,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
