Oil exporters aggressively seeking a price rise, including Iran, haven't given up the idea of at least a $2 increase from the current fixed-price base of $18 a barrel. But many oil industry officials and analysts suggest the best OPEC can hope for at the December meeting is to hold the $18 reference price through next year's first half -- barring a major disruption of supplies from the Persian Gulf.    Moreover, some say, sluggish petroleum demand could require new cuts in production if OPEC is to keep the price from falling below $18.    Leading OPEC oil ministers, including Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, concede price will be an acrimonious issue at the December meeting. Yet odds are against much of an increase, if any at all, they say.    &quot;I see the possibility of very heated discussions on this point,&quot; Mr. Lukman, who is also president of OPEC, said here. &quot;A case can be made for a price adjustment&quot; of $1 to $2 a barrel.    Some OPEC nations still insist on such an increase to compensate for depreciation in the dollar -- the currency used to price and purchase oil -- and for inflation since the current OPEC quote was fixed last December, he said.    But Mr. Lukman, recently returned from a tour of OPEC's Persian Gulf member states including the warring nations of Iraq and Iran, noted several other leading producing countries are more interested in maintaining their share of the oil market. Thus, they are likely to resist any change in the OPEC benchmark price, he said.    &quot;We're trying to be realistic,&quot; Mr. Lukman said. &quot;With the stock market (crash), we may have to be satisfied with stagnant (oil) demand for some time.&quot;    In earlier remarks to a London oil conference sponsored by the International Herald Tribune and the Oil Daily, both Mr. Lukman and Arne Oien, Norway's oil minister, predicted world oil prices will remain in the 1987 range for the next year or two. Prices this year have stayed between $18 and $20, except for a period last summer -- amid increased tensions in the Persian Gulf -- when they rose to near $23 a barrel.    Both indicated they don't expect any price increases in real terms -- that is, adjusted for inflation -- until the mid to late 1990s.    Although Norway isn't a member, it supports policies of OPEC and reduced its oil exports this year to 80,000 barrels a day in sympathy with the cartel's production targets. But Mr. Oien made clear further restrictions of Norwegian oil exports are unlikely even if OPEC decides to reduce its own oil production from the current ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day.    Mr. Lukman told the conference he expects world oil demand to grow only about 1% annually the remainder of this decade, and then 3% a year through the 1990s. But he indicated later these projections don't take into account possible repercussions on petroleum demand from last week's stock market crash.    &quot;We hope there isn't a recession, but if one comes along&quot; OPEC will have to assess the impact on oil production and pricing, Mr. Lukman said. &quot;We will pitch our quotas and prices on what we believe are the likely trends in demand over the next 12 months.&quot;    Total OPEC production has dropped in recent weeks but still is well above the ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day, Mr. Lukman said. He estimated current OPEC output at about 18.3 million barrels a daylower than many industry estimates.    While OPEC may face sluggish demand when the oil ministers meet in December, other factors also could affect the outcome, Mr. Lukman said. Increased tension between Saudi Arabia and Iran, who had collaborated in the December 1986 agreement, &quot;doesn't make matters easier,&quot; he said.    &quot;It may take longer to fashion an agreement, but the alternative is to go back to the chaos we had last year&quot; when oil prices collapsed, he said. In 1985, OPEC nations were competing for market share, and the resulting discounts forced the price of oil down to about $10 a barrel in March 1986 from $30.    Iran is pushing for an increase in the OPEC benchmark beyond $20 a barrel, and is supported by Libya, Algeria and some others. But the Persian Gulf Arab producers generally want to see the base price held at $18 for at least another year. Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, in particular, are more interested in maintaining current production than in raising the price.    Several members of OPEC had been banking on further gains in world oil consumption next year. But if petroleum demand turns sluggish, as many now expect, the need for OPEC oil will drop. &quot;Don't count on any increase in the call on OPEC oil next year,&quot; said a petroleum adviser to the ruler of one Mideast producing country. &quot;The clear message to OPEC -- if there is going to be a recession -- is that it had better get its act together.&quot;    Many analysts still expect demand for OPEC oil to average around 18 million barrels a day next year. But Humphrey Harrison, a London oil analyst with Banque Paribas, sees a real risk that oil prices will &quot;crater&quot; next year as low as $5 a barrel if OPEC tries to hold production that high. He estimates demand for OPEC oil will be only 15.5 million to 16.5 million barrels a day in the 1988 first half. &quot;Who's going to swing?&quot; he asked.    Saudi Arabia has recently emphasized it wouldn't any longer be the &quot;swing&quot; producer, reducing output while others in OPEC maintained production. But a high-level Saudi official said in an interview the kingdom still &quot;will be willing to swing&quot; next year if others in OPEC also reduce their output proportionately. </TEXT></DOC>
