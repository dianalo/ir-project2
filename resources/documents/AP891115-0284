The world's largest options marketplace is looking at trading inStandard andamp; Poor's 100 stock-index options during the Oct. 13 marketplunge as well as on other volatile trading days, said CBOEPresident Charles Henry.   The CBOE is the fourth major exchange to search forprogram-trading abuses. The New York Stock Exchange, the ChicagoBoard of Trade and Chicago Mercantile Exchange are conductingseparate probes of computer-assisted program trading in stocks andstock-index futures.   Those three exchanges have tightened surveillance measures andimposed stiff fines after long-term federal scrutiny resulted innumerous indictments and convictions.   Henry downplayed the CBOE investigation, saying the exchange hasroutinely monitored days of heavy trading since 1987.   ``We have an ongoing study,'' he said in a telephone interview.``We also make sure participants in our market behave as they aresupposed to.''   Program trading is the rapid buying and selling of stocks bycomputer to take advantage of temporary price differences. A stockindex option is the right to buy or sell the underlying value of astock index, such as the Sandamp;P 100, at a specified price within aspecified time.   The CBOE is looking at ``sources of volatility,'' includingtrades _ program or otherwise _ that may have involved manipulationor other forms of rule-breaking, Henry said.   For years, the exchange has been the subject of rumors aboutprogram-trading abuses _ rumors prompted partly by the complexityof options-related program-trading strategies.   Program trading involving stock-index options, commonly calledOEX, has also been blamed as a contributor to stock marketvolatility.   Tom Bond, CBOE vice president, pointed to three particular daysof heavy trading that are under scrutiny.   One was Oct. 13 when the Dow Jones industrial average fell190.58 points, its second biggest one-day point loss ever. Thesecond was Oct. 16 when the Dow rallied 88.12 points. The third daywas Oct. 24, when the Dow Jones industrials dropped 80 pointsbefore rallying to finish the day with a 3.69-point loss.   The CBOE's scrutiny of trading practices may date back to aclass-action lawsuit filed against the exchange after the October1987 stock market crash.   A group of more than 1,000 investors contend in the lawsuit thatthe CBOE and floor traders responsible for making markets incertain options on the Sandamp;P 100 violated federal law and theexchange's own rules by charging inflated prices for optionscontracts.   In May, the Securities and Exchange Commission censured the CBOEfor failing to enforce its own rules on trading manipulationinvolving stocks and options on Standard andamp; Poor's 500 index.   Program trades involving the Sandamp;P 100 options accounted for 8percent to 19 percent of total index arbitrage volume betweenNovember 1988 and April 1989, the SEC noted.</TEXT></DOC>
