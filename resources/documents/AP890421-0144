Police led the protesters from City Council chambers afterDeputy Police Commissioner Thomas McGeehan asked them to move fromcouncil members' chairs so the hearing could resume.   Robert Brand, a research director for the hospital workers'union, was the first person taken out of the chambers. He said hejoined the protest ``to guarantee that the city passes a budgetthat doesn't kill people.''   City Solicitor Seymour Kurland said he was not sure whetherthose detained would be charged.   Mayor W. Wilson Goode last month proposed a $2 billion budgetthat would cut spending for the homeless, AIDS and communityorganizations but bolster police and health clinic staffs.   Goode was not at the hearing. His spokeswoman, Karen Warrington,had no immediate comment.   The protest was organized by a coalition of labor and communitygroups. Four hundred people had packed the ornate chamber gallery,bearing signs saying ``AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power,'' ``SaveCity Health Services'' and ``Be Fair to Those Who Care.''   Testimony by city finance officials had barely begun whenprotesters began climbing over railings and seizing microphones onmembers' desks to make speeches or shout slogans.   A dozen police buses and paddy wagons raced to City Hall andofficers quickly lined the chamber as the protesters shouted: ``Yousay `Cut back.' We said `Fight back.'''   Council President Joseph C. Coleman tried to gavel theprotesters into silence a number of times, but gave up shortlybefore 11:30 a.m. and called a recess until afternoon.   Most of the protesters then left, but about 40 stayed.   When city officials tried to reconvene the hearing, the 12protesters who refused to go to the part of the room set aside forthe public were detained.   The hearing then proceeded quietly with a limited number ofpeople allowed to sit in the spectators' gallery. Many held protestsigns in silence.   Protesters will attend every council meeting and budget hearinguntil the budget is approved, said Joe Rogers, an activist withProject Share, an advocacy group for the homeless and mentally ill.   ``We'll be demanding that they develop a human budget, a humanebudget, that doesn't cut back at the cost of the poor,'' saidRogers, who also was detained.   City Councilman Angel Ortiz, a Democrat who has opposed thecuts, said he felt the protest effectively showed the budget ``is avery mean budget.''   ``We cannot be cutting recreation, health, AIDS, homeless and soon and expect to have a safe city,'' he said.   City Councilman Jack Kelly, a Republican, said the demonstrationwould have no effect on his support for less social spending.   ``This city took it on itself to fund these programs,'' he said,``and it's just escalated to the point where it's too expensive forthe people of Philadelphia to shoulder it.''</TEXT></DOC>
