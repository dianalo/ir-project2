The cash transaction would give Exco a strong presence in a market that trades about $110 billion a day in Treasury bonds, notes and bills and more than $20 billion daily in debt securities of federally sponsored agencies. Trading volume of government securities has more than doubled since December 1985.    Exco, a unit of British andamp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC, is one of the world's biggest brokers of interbank and foreign-exchange deposits. Under the agreement, Bank of New York Co. would reduce its 50.1% holding in RMJ to 10%. RMJ senior officials who own 49.9% of the broker's equity would cut their holdings to 10%.    U.S. government securities &quot;are by far the most important globally traded securities,&quot; said Richard Lacy, Exco's chairman. The market now trades &quot;about $5 billion a day in Tokyo and $15 billion a day in London, or at least twice the size&quot; of the British government securities market here. The RMJ acquisition would fill &quot;a gap we've always had as an international money broker and one that we've been trying to fill for the past four years,&quot; he said.    The agreement gives Exco the right to acquire the rest of RMJ over a six-year period, with that price based on RMJ's future earnings. The purchase, to be completed by May, also would include RMJ's mortgage-information unit and its 70% interest in a computer software concern that supplies specialist services to the financial community. RMJ already has a London office and last week received Japanese regulatory approval to open a Tokyo office.    In New York, Richard G. Jackson of RMJ said: &quot;We think it's a perfect marriage. This market is going global, toward a 24-hour trading day. The key word here is globalization. They (Exco) already are in several overseas markets. They bring a lot to the plate.&quot;    The proposed acquisition comes at a time of intense competition among the seven specialized firms -- three of them British -- that act as brokers to the 40 primary U.S. government securities dealers. Under pressure from the securities dealers, brokers in October 1985 cut their fees in half to about $39 from $78 per $1 million of 30-year Treasury bonds traded.    &quot;I think we'll be down to five government securities brokers within two years,&quot; Mr. Lacy predicted. Nevertheless, RMJ consistently has been profitable, with a 35% share of the brokers' market, the Exco chairman said. Industry sources in the U.S., however, expressed skepticism about that figure, saying it isn't that high. One of RMJ's main rivals, Fundamental Brokers Inc., New York, is controlled by London-based Mercantile House Holdings Group PLC, a diversified financial-services concern.    Peter Goldie, a managing director of British andamp; Commonwealth and an Exco director, said the suggested RMJ purchase price values the company &quot;roughly at six times its current annual net income.&quot; He predicted that RMJ would contribute about 25% to Exco's annual pre-tax earnings, which in 1985 totaled $136.7 million, converting at current foreign-exchange rates.    He also said that RMJ would account for between 5% and 10% of British andamp; Commonwealth's net earnings per share on a full-year basis in 1987. Analysts have forecast that British andamp; Commonwealth will earn about 39 cents a share this year. In the first half of 1986, British andamp; Commonwealth had net income of $25.2 million, or more than 11 cents a share, down from $42.2 million, or 18 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.    British andamp; Commonwealth, which has a market capitalization of nearly $2.2 billion, acquired Exco last November for $1.05 billion. The former shipping group gradually has developed into a diversified conglomerate with extensive interests in financial services, air transport and aviation services, office equipment distribution and hotels.    Exco, which also owns several currency, securities and insurance brokers, repeatedly has failed to acquire a U.S. government securities broker despite a sizable $398.9 million in cash. In 1985, for instance, it lost a bid for control of RMJ when Security Pacific Corp., a bank and U.S. government securities dealer, agreed to sell its majority stake to Bank of New York.    In New York, Bank of New York said it expects to post a &quot;substantial&quot; gain in the second quarter from the sale of its stake in RMJ, but declined to be more specific. The company acquired its 50.1% interest in RMJ last March from Los Angeles-based Security Pacific for an undisclosed sum. A five-member management group led by RMJ's Mr. Jackson acquired the remainder.    A spokesman for Bank of New York said the company decided to sell the stake &quot;primarily because we received a very attractive offer.&quot; But he added, &quot;There have been basic changes in the U.S. government securities brokerage business that raise questions about its future.&quot; He declined to elaborate.    RMJ and several other large bond brokers have carved out an extremely lucrative share of the massive U.S. government securities market. Dealers use brokers for much of their trading because the brokers offer them anonymity, which dealers consider vital in their trading strategy.    The Justice Department has been investigating possible antitrust violations by bond brokers and dealers. Government officials have been unwilling to divulge details of the probe, but sources familiar with it say one major item under study is the major brokers' decision to limit access to pricing information supplied by brokers on their electronic screens.    Most brokers supply their screens only to the 40 commercial banks and securities dealers recognized by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as &quot;primary dealers,&quot; as well as another dozen or so firms aspiring to become primary dealers. </TEXT></DOC>
