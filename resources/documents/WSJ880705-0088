Dickey Jr., a former Vernon Savings andamp; Loan Association executive, agreed to plead guilty to a charge of misleading federal regulators about the status of Vernon's loans.    Vernon was closed by federal regulators in November, costing the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. $1.3 billion in one of the most expensive restructurings ever. About 96% of the thrift's loans were delinquent when federal regulators took it over in March 1987.    The Dallas bank fraud task force, which includes the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. attorney's office, charged that Mr. Dickey removed a $200,000 loan from Vernon's delinquent loan list in late 1985 even though he knew the loan was delinquent. If the loan had been included in the list, Vernon's profit and net worth disclosures probably would have attracted regulatory attention, the task force said.    Mr. Dickey faces a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $250,000 fine. He was president of Vernon in 1983 and held several other executive positions with the savings and loan until early 1987, his attorney said. He said Mr. Dickey is expected to enter his guilty plea this month.    Two other Vernon executives have pleaded guilty to bank-fraud charges. </TEXT></DOC>
