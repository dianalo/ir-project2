A communique issued at the end of Speaker Hashemi Rafsanjani'sfour-day visit, including two days of talks with President MikhailS. Gorbachev, said the two sides agreed ``to build and develop goodneighborly relations on the principles of equality.''   Rafsanjani, who is also the acting commander of Iran's armedforces, is the highest ranking Iranian official to visit Moscowsince the 1979 revolution that crushed the Iranian Communist Partyand sent mobs into the streets shouting ``Death to America, Death toRussia!''   He went to Moscow barely three weeks after the death of Iran'srevolutionary patriarch, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini _ while hiscountry's official 40-day mourning period is still in effect.   Friday's communique, according to the official Soviet news agencyTass, said Moscow and Tehran will ``develop economic, scientific,technological and commercial relations, as well as cooperation inother fields such as medical services and student and lecturerexchanges on a long-term basis.''   Rafsanjani and Gorbachev also signed a declaration pledging tofoster contacts between Soviet religious leaders and those of Iran.   The declaration promised Soviet cooperation in ``strengtheningthe defense capacity'' of its southern neighbor, indicating that theKremlin planned to sell weapons to Iran.   The Soviet Union was Iraq's major arms supplier during theeight-year Iran-Iraq war, a factor that contributed to the strain inrelations with Iran.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency quoted Rafsanjani assaying at Tehran airport upon his return home, ``Our negotiationsspanned many fields including cooperation in the economic,commercial and cultural sectors as well as in the internationalarena.''   Rafsanjani, originally due to return home Thursday, extended hisvisit by one day to visit the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, describedby Tehran radio as a ``Moslem city.''   During a state dinner Wednesday, he invited Gorbachev to visitIran. If Gorbachev accepts, he would be the first leader of a majorpower to visit Tehran since the revolution.   Gorbachev and Khomeini exchanged messages last February, andtheir foreign ministers then met four times, paving the way forRafsanjani's visit.   Rafsanjani received red-carpet treatment throughout the trip. Hesaid Thursday after his meetings with Gorbachev, ``The optimism wehad before the meetings has been totally justified.''   On Friday, Iranian media quoted him as saying, ``The enthusiasmshown by the Soviet people toward us, especially by the Moslems wasbeyond imagination. Such receptions in Moscow, Leningrad andparticularly in Baku were very frank and sincere.''   Tehran television said Baku's Moslems thronged to receive theIranian delegation. It said most were dressed in black, in mourningfor Khomeini's death.   Tehran radio, Tehran TV and IRNA all were monitored in Cyprus.   Rafsanjani, an advocate of ending Iran's isolation and buildingcloser ties abroad, disclosed this month that days before his deathKhomeini advised better relations with the Soviet Union.   Iranian Chief Justice Musavi Ardebili said Friday that Iran willnot be swayed by U.S. ``threats'' about its developing relationshipwith the Soviet Union, Tehran radio reported.   The United States has expressed concern about warming relationsbetween Tehran and Moscow, and Soviet willingness to sell arms toIran.   U.S. Secretary of State James Baker III told the House ForeignAffairs Committee the administration is ``concerned about thepossibility of weapons transfers.''   Anti-Americanism has been a major plank in Iranian policy sincethe Islamic revolution overthrew the shah and brought Khomeini topower.   Relations with Moscow improved strongly recently as Iran soughtto rebuild its economy after the devastation of the Iran-Iraq war.   The war was halted last August by a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire.</TEXT></DOC>
