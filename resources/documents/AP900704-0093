(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The grape farmer was in the front row,and the plumber and vacuum-cleaner salesman were close by.   That was the payoff for cajoling country-rock star Jerry JeffWalker to give a concert in the picture-postcard village of NorthEast on the shore of Lake Erie.   Walker acknowledged the plumber-turned-promoter by sporting an``Ollinger's Plumbing, Heating and Air Conditioning'' T-shirt underhis black jacket. He traded his beige felt cowboy hat for a maroonNorth East baseball cap.   ``I like a man who knows what he wants and goes and gets it,''Walker hollered to the screams and shouts of 250 fans who packed abarn-turned-restaurant for Walker's concert Tuesday night. ``Andthey said it couldn't be done.''   Chuck Ollinger got the idea of a Walker concert so Ollinger andhis buddies could have front-row seats to hear one of theirfavorite singers.   Ollinger called Walker's agent and struck a deal that Ollingerwould put half the money up front.   ``It was a spur-of-the-moment kind of thing,'' said Ollinger,36. ``We had no idea what we were doing.''   ``It was either going to fly or else it was going to be a realexpensive Fourth of July,'' said Bill Neil, 36, a grape farmer whoput up some of the advance money. The amount was not disclosed.   Walker catapulted to fame in 1968 when he recorded thenow-classic ``Mr. Bojangles.'' Other hits include ``L.A. Freeway''and ``Up Against the Wall, Redneck.''   ``These guys wanted me here, and they paid my money,'' Walker,48, said before taking to the makeshift stage at the DelhurstCountry Inn.   ``I do the solo thing this way ... for economic reasons. Whenguys are carrying six, seven, eight people around, they keepthemselves out of the market. I did that longer and longer withless and less money to show for it.''   Ollinger wanted to bring Walker to North East after he saw himperform at a small club in Pittsburgh, about 150 miles to thesouth. He called Walker's agent and struck a deal that requiredOllinger put half the money up front before a contract could besigned. To Walker, it was a good arrangement because he was headedto his 30th high school reunion in Oneonta this Saturday.   Ollinger tapped four friends to help _ Neil; Rich Timer, acomputer salesman; Brad Wallace, a vacuum cleaner salesman; andRandy Cunningham, a car dealer. They signed the contract at the endof May.   With the help of a local radio station and word-of-mouthadvertising, the $18 tickets were sold out in four days.   ``We could have sold at least 500 tickets with the limitedadvertising we did _ more if we spent money on advertising,'' saidTimer, 36.</TEXT></DOC>
