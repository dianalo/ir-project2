Henry Kempen, marketing manager for a well-known wineestate, says exports of South African wines could double inthe next few years.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;If one is optimistic about South Africa, then one isoptimistic about sanctions and boycotts being lifted and thefuture of the South African wine industry,&quot; says Mr. Kempen,who is marketing manager for Douglas Green of Paarl, a unitof Kersaf Liquor Holdings Inc.   South African wine producers need to seek new exportmarkets because internal consumption has decreased whileproduction has increased.   Production of all types of wine, including table wine,fortified wine and flavored wine, increased by 6% to 953million liters (247.8 million gallons) in 1990 from 898million liters in 1984. Exports as a percentage of productionfell to 22.8% in 1990 from 24.6% in 1984. The actual numberof liters exported and rand value figures are unavailable dueto the &quot;sensitivity&quot; of the issue.   The Cape Wine and Spirits Association estimates exportscurrently make up 20% of production.   Most wine producers are aiming for the European Community,which relies on voluntary boycotts against South Africanagricultural products instead of the legal barriers erectedby the U.S. and Canada.   Europe has traditionally been South Africa's majoroverseas wine market, although the political climate damagedthe export market by stunting export growth.   The Cooperative Winegrowers Association of South Africa(KWV), the producer responsible for exporting the country'ssurplus as well as setting minimum prices and productionquotas, estimates the percentage of table wine sold overseashas remained at around 15% for the past 10 years. It expectsexports of table wine to increase by 80% in 1991. The actualamount in liters of the estimated increase wasn't provided.   Wine makers say South Africa's political reforms haveeased concerns of overseas consumers.   &quot;I've been to Europe a couple of times this year and I'veseen a tremendous change in opinion about South Africa fromwine distributors and merchants,&quot; says Simon Dewhurst,marketing executive for Bergkelder Estates, a subsidiary ofDistillers Corporation (S.A.) Ltd., which has agents in theEC.   But difficulties exist in exporting wine to EC countries.   A current wine surplus -- the so-called wine lake -- hasnarrowed the market, and EC countries have set a price floor,preventing undercutting.   &quot;There is a snobbery factor involved,&quot; says RodrickBlondin, deputy director for agricultural economic trends inthe government. &quot;If Europeans can buy a good French wine forthe same price as a good South African wine, they'll tend tochoose the French one.&quot;   At home, consumption has always been small. Only 8.7% ofthe alcohol-drinking population are classified as winedrinkers by Distillers Corp., South Africa's biggest producerand wholesaler. It classified 24% as beer drinkers.   In recent years, domestic wine consumption has decreasedto 9.07 liters per capita in 1989 from 9.90 liters per capitain 1984. Production of wine has increased by 6% to 956million liters in 1989 from 898 million liters in 1984.   South African wine makers say they can overcome EC marketbarriers because the rand is weak compared with most Europeancurrencies, making their wine cheaper for Europeans to buy.They also cite the high quality of their wine.   &quot;Our wines have won many international awards; they aregood value for the price,&quot; says Riaan Kruger, director of theCape Wine and Spirits Institute. The quality is good enoughto attract buyers despite the minimum prices set in Europe,he says.   &quot;We have to be price competitive overseas because we'reoperating in a hostile environment. We're cutting our profitsto the bone,&quot; says Cas Du Plessis of KWV.   Producers say exchange rates and low labor costs, a relicof the apartheid system, are the main factors that keep SouthAfrican wines relatively cheap.   Wine farm laborers have no unions. Their minimum salary isabout 5,000 rand (about $1,525) a year, but they receivehousing, utilities, medical care and transportation, alongwith some of the products they grow and produce.</TEXT></DOC>
