Today, we rejoice because the system of governmentit established has not only endured, but prospered. Indeed, the great documentwe celebrate this week changed forever the course of human history.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In 1787, the future of the United States was still uncertain. However,it was very clear that the Articles of Confederation_which had looselyassembled the 13 States in a ``league of friendship''_needed to be revised.After our country's independence was formally recognized by the Treatyof Paris in 1783, the cause that once united the 13 colonies had been won_andthey fell to contentiousness and discord.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress of the Confederation, then the central government ofthe United States, was nearly bankrupt. It had no authority to impose taxesand no power to collect them. The States were printing their own money,which was often worth little inside their borders and nothing beyond them.Engaged in disputes over territorial boundaries and the use of each other'sports and roadways, the former colonies were on the verge of splittinginto 13 separate, wholly sovereign_perhaps even hostile_nations. Theirlack of unity left the young country highly vulnerable to the threats ofEuropean powers.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">A number of American leaders at the time, including Alexander Hamiltonand James Madison, called for a convention of the States to reform theArticles of Confederation. George Washington, frustrated by the Congress'inability to provide for the Continental Army, echoed their concerns whenhe sharply noted that ``Influence is no government.'' Once relations betweenseveral of the States reached a crisis point, the Congress of the Confederationfinally agreed to a Federal Convention.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Through months of intense debate and skillful compromise, the delegatesto the Federal Convention carefully shaped our Constitution. Knowing thedanger of relying upon human wisdom alone in forming a free and just government,they often prayed for Divine guidance as they defined the powers of theCongress and the President; established the manner in which legislatorsand the President would be elected; outlined the Judicial system; and assertedStates' rights. The Founding Fathers also provided for amendment, as wellas ratification, of the Constitution.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">More than 200 years after it was written, our Constitution is a glorioustestament to the wisdom and foresight of its Framers. Today, we celebratethe success of their labors. The Constitution, and the Bill of Rights lateradded ot it, has been a blessing to every American citizen and a lightto the world.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">All Americans have an obligation to ensure that this shining experimentin self-government continues to succeed. As citizens of a free Nation,each of us has both the right and the responsibility to become educatedand informed; to vote for those who represent us; and to participate atall levels of government. This week, let us give thanks for the freedomwe so enjoy, and let us pause to learn more about our rights and dutiesas American citizens. For, as President Washington stated in his firstAnnual Message to the Congress:<ITAG tagnum="53">Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.. . . To the security of a free Constitution it contributes in variousways_by convincing those who are intrusted with the public administrationthat every valuable end of government is best answered by the enlightenedconfidence of the people, and by teaching the people themselves to knowand value their own rights . . . to distinguish between oppression andthe necessary exercise of authority . . . to discriminate the spirit ofliberty from that of licentiousness_cherishing the first, avoiding thelast_and uniting a speedy but temperate vigiliance against encroachments,with an inviolable respect to the laws.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Congress, by joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (36 U.S.C.153), designated September 17 as ``Citizenship Day'' in commemoration ofthe signing of the Constitution and in recognition of all who, by birthor by naturalization, have attained the status of citizenship, and authorizedthe President to issue annually a proclamation calling upon officials ofthe government to display the flag on all government buildings on thatday. Also, by joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (36 U.S.C. 159), the Congressdesignated the week beginning September 17 and ending September 23 of eachyear as ``Constitution Week'' in recognition of the historic importanceof the Constitution and the significant role it plays in our lives today.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States ofAmerica, do hereby proclaim September 17, 1989, as Citizenship Day andcall upon appropriate government officials to display the flag of the UnitedStates on all government buildings.
