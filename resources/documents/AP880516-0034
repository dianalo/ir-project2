African Minerals Would Cost $1.85 Billion</HEAD><BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A ban on imports of strategic metals fromSouth Africa would cost the U.S. economy at least $1.85 billion ayear and bring shortages of a key component of auto pollutioncontrol equipment, according to a Bureau of Mines study.   About 94 percent of the costs would result from a cutoff ofSouth African shipments of platinum and rhodium, with the restspread among other metals including palladium, manganese, chromium,titanium and vanadium, the study said.   Platinum, palladium and rhodium are essential constituents ofpollution-control catalytic converters on automobiles in the UnitedStates and Japan. Other members of the platinum group areruthenium, iridium and osmium.   Recycling, reduced consumption, other imports and higherdomestic production could close the gap for most metals, the studysaid. But ``a major domestic shortage of rhodium'' could beexpected.   For all the metals in question, South Africa is either thelargest or second-largest producer in the world. The United Statesimports half to all its supplies of all of them, though notentirely from South Africa for any one. The Soviet Union is a majorsupplier of many of the metals, and the study warned thatdependence on Soviet supplies would increase if South Africanmetals weren't available.   The study was requested by the State Department afteranti-apartheid sanctions against South Africa were enacted byCongress in 1986, measures which did not affect the metals trade.The House Foreign Affairs Committee earlier this month approved anew bill which would end all U.S. investment in South Africa andban almost all trade, but would not affect strategic metals.   Some analysts have said South Africa could forbid shipment ofthe metals as a retaliation.   The Bureau of Mines study assumed that under an embargo onmetals shipments to the United States, shipments to other countrieswould continue. If South African supplies were cut off toeverybody, ``economic impacts will be greater than in the case of aU.S. embargo.''   It also assumed no use would be made of emergency stockpilesheld in the United States for use by the Defense Department, thatno production incentives would be applied and that no technologicalimprovements would be forthcoming. It limited its forecasts to thenext five years.   No estimate was made of the effects of an overall disruption,but figures were given from an earlier study of chromium andmanganese. An embargo would cost $30 million a year for chromiumand $31 million for manganese; a total disruption would cost anaverage of $1.2 billion a year for chromium and $330 million formanganese.   Costs would be incurred in the form of higher prices foralternate supplies, for expanding U.S. production and recycling andfor switching to substitutes. For example, the cost of platinumcould be expected to rise from about $1,300 an ounce to about$8,600 an ounce, the study said.   Rhodium shortages would arise because the metal has been used inauto catalysts since 1981, compared with 1974 for the other twocatalyst metals, so not as much is available for recycling. Becausepractically none is being recovered from cars now being junked, arecycling system would have to be built from scratch.   ``As a result of the embargo there are insufficient availableworld supplies to meet domestic demand in the second and thirdyears of the embargo,'' the study said.   ``Consumption decreases can be expected in both auto catalystsand other industrial applications and may result in impacts ondomestic industrial production.''   No effort was made to calculate the costs to the economy ofproduction losses caused by shortages.</TEXT></DOC>
