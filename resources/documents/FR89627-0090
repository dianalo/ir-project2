Under Pub.L. 89-599, in which the United States assented to the creation of the TransportationAuthority by the States of Missouri and Kansas, the Transportation Authoritywas exempted from the applicability of the provisions of the InterstateCommerce Act and rules, regulations, and orders promulgated thereunder.The Transportation Authority is beyond our jurisdiction and may abandonthis track without our authority. We will treat the notice as a requestfor discontinuance of the trackage rights operations only. Applicants have certified that: (1) No local traffic has moved over theline for at least 2 years; (2) any overhead traffic on the line can bererouted over other lines; and (3) no formal complaint filed by a userof rail service on the line (or a State or local government entity actingon behalf of such user) regarding cessation of service over the line eitheris pending with the Commission or with any U.S. District Court or has beendecided in favor of the complainant within the 2-year period. The appropriateState agency has been notified in writing at least 10 days prior to thefiling of this notice. The circumstances surrounding the abandonment ofthis line are unusual. This Commission had previously authorized the abandonmentof this line by its then owner, Freight Operation, in <T3>Modern Handcraft, Inc._Abandonment,</T3> 363 I.C.C. 969 (1981) on petitionby an adjacent property owner, and by its current owner, the TrasnportationAuthority. We noted: ``Although it is true that the grant of an abandonmentapplication is permissive and the railroad can choose not to surrenderits common carrier status and obligations, a certificate of abandonmentis evidence in any court proceeding that the line is not required by thepublic for rail operations.'' 366 I.C.C. at 972. The Transportation Authority,which joined in Modern Handcraft's abandonment application to permit theline to be condemned, did not pursue condemnation. Rather, it acquiredthe line form Freight Operation. Thus Transportation Authority, applicantherein, states that the abandonment authorized by the Commission has notbeen consummated, despite a long and continuous cessation of service, andthat this agency retains jurisdiction to issue this notice. Applicantsalso state that this class exemption presupposes the retention of Commissionjurisdiction over lines which have been out of service for a long time.Applicants have set forth a basis for Commission jurisdiction to issuethis notice. Due to the unusual circumstances of this case, however, wewill require applicants to serve a copy of this <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice on all adjacent landowners known to hold,or known to claim to hold, reversionary interests in the right of way.The Transportation Authority also requests issuance of a Notice of InterimTrail Use or Abandonment (NITU). It indicates its willingness to assumefinancial responsibility for interim trails use and rail banking underthe National Trails System Act, 16 U.S.C. 1247(d), and the correspondingregulations at 49 CFR 1152.29. We have authority to impose a NITU wherediscontinuance of operations rather than abandonment is involved. <T3>See Vermont andamp; VT RY_Discontinuance_Crittenden Co., VT,</T3> 3 I.C.C.2d903 (1987). However, offers of financial assistance under 49 U.S.C. 10905take priority over interim trail use conditions. Since this notice involvesonly a discontinuance, there can be no offer to acquire the line. A requestcould be filed to subsidize the existing operator, however. Therefore,we will not issue a NITU until the time for filing offers of financialassistance has expired, or until it is clear that the line will not besubsidized under the financial assistance procedures. Moreover, other partiesare not foreclosed form filing requests for interim trail use within 10days after publication of this notice of exemption. The Commission willalso accept a late-filed trail use statement so long as it retains jurisdictionto do so. Employee protective conditions will not be imposed because the discontinuanceof operations over this line is equivalent to discontinuance of the entireoperations of Freight Operation.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See Modern Handcraft, Inc._Abandonment</T3>, 363 I.C.C. 969, 973 (1981),and cases cited thereunder.Provided no formal expression of intent to file an offer of financial assistancehas been received, this exemption will be effective on July 27, 1989 (unlessstayed pending reconsideration).
