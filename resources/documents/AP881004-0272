(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Singer Co. said Tuesday it hadcompleted its $2 billion divestiture program with the sale of itsKearfott Division to Astronautics Corp. of America.   Singer was acquired by Bilzerian Partners in February for about$1 billion.   The new owners embarked on a divestiture plan that has seen thecompany sell eight units since May.   ``Our plan from the outset of the acquisition was to retainSinger businesses with approximately $400 million of annualrevenues,'' said Paul A. Bilzerian, Singer chairman and chiefexecutive officer.   The company said the sales have brought in more money than theacquisition cost, including debt, interest expense and otherexpenses.   The Kearfott Division, based in Little Falls, N.J., is involvedin making equipment used in guidance and navigation systems.   Astronautics is based in Milwaukee and is involved in makingaircraft instruments and flight control systems.   What's left at Singer is a company involved principally indefense-related work with total sales expected to exceed $400million in 1988.
