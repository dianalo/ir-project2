The authors have used radioactive labels to examine the effectsof recrystallization by this mechanism on the distribution between phasesand also between the solid particles. Sucrose tagged with {sup 14}C wasadded to a solution saturated at 65{sup 0}C. After drying, the crystalswere separated into fractions, for which the mean sizes anti r were determined.The authors then measured the specific activities of the interstitialsolution N/sub i/, crystals N/sub c/, and N/sub r/, the same for sizefraction r.</TEXT></DOC>
