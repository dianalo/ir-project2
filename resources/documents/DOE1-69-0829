When this is fully implementedreal time data from neighboring systems will be available, sometimesin solved (state estimated) form. However, given the technical and jurisdictionalproblems of exchanging information the full availability of real timeexternal model data is still a few years away. For some time to come,the external model calculation will have to be done without real timedata. In this paper, the various algorithmic, software design and implementationconsiderations for modeling the external network is presented and theirinter-relationships are discussed. Test results are presented to showthat neither the REI nor the Ward reduction have better accuracy thanthe unreduced models. Better determination of the actual model usingoff-line studies is suggested. But, mainly, the practical considerations,like data base construction, real time data availability, error detection,effects of network islanding, etc., that greatly influence the choiceof model are discussed in conjunction with the traditional concerns foraccuracy and computational efficiency.</TEXT></DOC>
