Wolfgang Schwanitz, the national security chief, barred allflights to Romania following reports that sensitive material wasbeing smuggled out of the country to the hard-line Warsaw Pact ally.   Members of the largest opposition group demanded a referendum onGerman reunification and urged the government to allow quick freeelections. One spokesman said Communist leaders had ``lost alllegitimacy.''   Premier Hans Modrow, a Communist reformer, emerged as thecountry's No. 1 political leader after the entire party leadershipresigned in disgrace Sunday and left a 25-member committee incontrol of the government.   Protests continued despite the resignations.   ``We don't need any Politburo and Central Committee that is madeup of criminals!'' one woman screamed at a rally of about 10,000people Sunday night in East Berlin ``This should have happened longago!'' a man shouted.   The official ADN news agency said security agents were stationedoutside party offices in East Berlin to prevent former members ofthe Politburo and Central Committee from gaining access todocuments in file cabinets and safes.   Agents also stood guard outside official guest houses followinggrowing public resentment of the privileges enjoyed by the formerleadership, it said. The security measures were aimed at keepingvaluables and possibly documents that might be used as evidencefrom being removed.   Several former leaders have been accused in a growing corruptioninvestigation of abusing their powers and stealing money from thestate.   Modrow, the 61-year-old reformer and former Dresden party chief,led East Germany's delegation at the Warsaw Pact summit that beganin Moscow today, ADN reported.   Also attending the summit were Foreign Minister Oskar Fischerand Egon Krenz, who resigned as party chief Sunday along with theparty's 10-member ruling Politburo and its entire 163-memberCentral Committee.   Krenz went to the Moscow meeting in the largely ceremonial roleof head of state. ADN mentioned no further role for him.   Just two months ago, the party's hierarchy enforced iron-fistedrule. Now, the former ruling elite has its back against the wall asdemands grow for punishment of those who lived in style while EastGermany sank into crisis.   Modrow, elected premier Nov. 13 by a Parliament that broke withthe discredited Communists, now appears in charge of day-to-dayaffairs, and official newspapers predicted an imminent split in theCommunist Party.   Public resentment of the ruling Communists has reached a feverpitch and Modrow is seen as more acceptable than the oustedauthoritarian leadership that long shunned him.   Many of the party's rank-and-file are disgusted with the highlife the ousted elite is reported to have enjoyed.   In Sunday's housecleaning, Erich Honecker, Krenz's predecessoras party leader, and 11 other members of the hard-line Old Guardwere expelled from the party; three former Politburo members werearrested on corruption charges; and the country's chief of tradewith the West fled.   The pressure on the party increased today, with the oppositiongroup New Forum demanding a law allowing quick free elections.   The group, with 200,000 members, also urged a nationalreferendum to decide on German reunification. There have beengrowing calls to reunite the two Germanys, but New Forum previouslyhad warned against such suggestions.   A statement signed by New Forum leaders Claus Gerd Scheidig andChristiane Paetzold said the long-term possibility of one Germanstate within present borders of the two countries was ``no longeran unthinkable utopia.''   The statement urged all New Forum organizations to press for aquick a referendum to find out ``what the real wish of the people''was on the issue of reunification.   West Germany claims that most East Germans want reunification,but there have been no opinion polls or other indications of howEast Germans feel about the issue.   Among the reformers named Sunday to the new 25-member CommunistParty committee are Dresden Mayor Wolfgang Berghofer and thecountry's former spy chief, Markus Wolf.   A spokesman for the committee, Gregor Gysi, said its immediatetask would be to investigate corruption among the discreditedCommunist elite.   The committee will effectively rule as the party prepares for aspecial congress on Dec. 15, when it is expected to choose newleaders.   Several hundred thousand people joined hands to form ``humanchains'' in sections across the country Sunday and displayed signscalling for the removal of the ``Central Committee mafia'' andimprisonment for ex-party ``criminals.''   The party that has ruled East Germany for all its 40 years hasalready abolished its guaranteed monopoly on power and promisedfree elections for as early as next year.   Krenz was not named to the new reform committee. His was theshortest reign of any East German leader.   Responding to massive protest demonstrations, Krenz opened theBerlin Wall on Nov. 9 and promised reforms including freeelections, but calls increased for his removal because of his pastlinks to Honecker's rule.   Guenter Schabowski, among those ousted from the Politburo, saidthe 12 expelled Sunday were suspected of ``serious violations ofparty statutes.'' Among those thrown out were ex-Premier WilliStoph and former Parliament speaker Horst Sindermann.</TEXT></DOC>
