McCabe, who is based in Iraq, has been in Lebanon since Saturdaytrying to verify news reports that Irish hostage Brian Keenan wasabout to be freed.   ``I hope that what was said about the hostages ... might prove toinaugurate positive developments in regards to the hostages beforetoo long,'' he said.   McCabe spoke to reporters after a 30-minute meeting in Moslemwest Beirut with Salah Staitieh, chief of the Foreign Ministry'spolitical department. He refused to comment on the talks.   Nabih Berri, who heads the Shiite Moslem Amal militia, predicteda rapid release of the hostages in a statement to reporters inDamascus on Monday.   He spoke after a truce between his pro-Syrian militia and theIranian-backed Hezbollah ended their nine-month war in south Beirutand southern Lebanon. The Amal-Hezbollah accord was sponsored bySyria and Iran.   ``The peace pact did not refer directly to the hostages, but I amsure that this agreement would help the release of hostages asquickly as possible,'' Berri said.   Amal is not involved in hostage-taking. Hezbollah is believed tobe the umbrella for pro-Iranian fundamentalist factions holding mostof the 15 foreigners missing in Lebanon.   McCabe said the Irish government was ``in touch with all thegovernments that might be in a position to render assistance interms of securing the early release.''   Keenan, 38, was kidnapped April 11, 1986 as he walked to theAmerican University of Beirut where he taught English. No group hasclaimed his abduction.   McCabe said Keenan's kidnappers have not contacted him.   ``No organization has indicated who should get in touch with meor with other representatives of the Irish government on thissubject,'' McCabe said.   In addition to Keenan, who also holds British citizenship, thecaptives in Lebanon are nine Americans, three Britons, an Italianand a Belgian.   The hostage held longest is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.</TEXT></DOC>
