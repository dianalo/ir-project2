Dan Quayle was met by protesters andby workers wearing Dukakis-Bentsen T-shirts today when he arrivedto tour a steel plant.   Steelworker Eugene Autry, a Vietnam veteran, carried a signsaying, ``Draft dodger Quayle, Who died in your place?'' _ areference to Quayle's service in the National Guard in Indianaduring the Vietnam war.   Autry, standing at the plant as the Indiana senator's motorcadedrove past, said, ``He's asking American men to vote for him, menwhose sons died in Vietnam, whose fathers died in Korea, whosegrandfathers fought World War II.''   Inside the stainless steel plant, machinist John Ledrich, one ofthe workers wearing a shirt promoting Quayle and George Bush'sDemocratic rivals, said, ``I'm here to tell you that him and Bushare against the 60-day plan on plant closings. They've come to thewrong place.''   One day earlier, Joe Coyle, director of United Steel WorkersDistrict 27, which organized the demonstration, said, ``Sen.Quayle's record in Congress is one that is in opposition to almosteverything working people stand for.''   Quayle's campaign was aware of the planned demonstration, butsenior adviser Ken Kachigian said, ``He's not going to run away.''   He said Quayle has ``had a great rapport'' with steelworkers inhis home state of Indiana.   George Niarchos, manager of production services at the plant,said it had about 440 employees, about 100 of them trained underthe Job Partnership Training Act sponsored in the Senate by Quayle.He said the plant has been operating for two years and had beenclosed for bankruptcy before that.   Earlier this week, Bush, the Republican presidential nominee,ran into taunts and jeers when he addressed workers at an Oregonshipyard.   Meanwhile, in a report that recalled stories on Quayle'sacademic past that surfaced shortly after his nomination, TheCleveland Plain Dealer reported today that Quayle was admitted tolaw school under an experimental affirmative action program.   The newspaper quoted officials at the Indiana University Schoolof Law who said the program was intended to increase admissionsopportunities for minorities, the economically disadvantaged andothers of differing backgrounds.   Cleon H. Faust, the law school dean who approved the program in1969, said, ``I can only remember blacks (as the aim of theprogram).'' He added, ``The program sort of made up for theirbackground. The suggestion was that many (blacks) had not had thescholastic background to cut the mustard in graduate school.''   Quayle, on his way out of his hotel in Canton, Ohio, thismorning, told reporters, ``I got into law school fair and square,and I did rather well there.''   The newspaper said records of who was admitted under the programwere not released by the university.   The visit to Massillon, and later speeches to the Canton RotaryClub and the Copco Metal Products Co. in Youngstown follow a day inwhich Quayle sought to tout the congressional foreign policycredentials he brings to the Republican presidential ticket.   In a speech to the City Club of Chicago, he called for askeptical view of the Soviet Union, saying ``the jury is stillout'' on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's intentions.   The Thursday speech, following his earlier attacks on Democraticpresidential nominee Michael Dukakis as weak and inexperienced inforeign policy, was designed to show ``the breadth and knowledgeand experience he brings to the ticket on defense and foreignpolicy issues,'' said press secretary David Prosperi.   Departing from the prepared text, Quayle said the United Statesmust move ahead on modernization of conventional forces anddevelopment of the Strategic Defense Initiative system.   He also blasted the Congress, where he sits on the Senate ArmedServices Committee, for blocking foreign policy initiatives through``micromismanagement.''   ``Congress doesn't even know what the definition of depressedtrajectory of a ballistic missile is,'' Quayle said derisively.``Yet they prohibit it. And they ask the secretary of defense toplease define what the depressed trajectory of a ballistic missileis, but while you're defining it Mr. Secretary, we are going toprohibit it.   ``That is the kind of micromismanagement that we can dowithout.''   Quayle said he wants to see more proof of Gorbachev's commitmentto reforms in Eastern Europe, whether he will honor treaty and armsreduction agreements and whether there will be human rightsprogress.   ``The Soviet Union, as long as it has its ideology of Marxismand Leninism, will always be an adversary, will always be acompetitor,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
