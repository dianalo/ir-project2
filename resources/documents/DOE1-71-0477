The features of this simple and secure system are brieflydiscussed. Some efforts have been done to make a conversational systemeasily understandable for operators. The keystone of the control systemis an fibre optical link (wireless) between the cyclotron and the computer.The control system is based on the use of an extended configuration ofthe IBM PC/AT computer. A new system software is used to execute multitaskhierarchical programs to control the cyclotron. The comercial adaptersfor control and data aquisition, connected with the fibre optic communicationchannels are used to transmit data and control codes. Two colour graphicCRT displays the ongoing status and function of each controlled unitsso that the operator can monitor the whole system conditions at a glance.The paper gives a general description of the programs which are executedon the computer. It also shows how the cyclotron is controlled by dedicatedcomputer practically without special electronic equipment except of thehardware safety cutout switch. The cyclotron is protected against operatingincidents and mistakes by a complex system of interlocks.</TEXT></DOC>
