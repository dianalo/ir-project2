MARTIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than one in five college men usesnuff or chewing tobaco, nearly twice the number who smoke,according to a nationwide survey.   ``Smokeless tobacco is a serious problem in American collegesand universities,'' said Elbert D. Glover, a Penn State Universityprofessor of health education who conducted the study. ``Unless wedo something, by the year 2000 (or) 2010, we're going to experiencean oral cancer epidemic.''   A 1986 surgeon general's report said smokeless tobacco plays arole in tooth cavities, gum disease and oral cancer and is believedto have the same addictive potential as cigarettes.   Of the 5,894 college or university students participating inGlover's study, 22 percent of the men said they dipped or chewedtobacco, compared to 13 percent who said they smoked.   Among the college or university women surveyed, 2 percent saidthey used snuff or chewing tobacco, while 16 percent said theysmoked.   Glover, director of the Center for Tobacco Studies at PennState, said the recent survey is the first national study ofsmokeless tobacco use among college students. The center is notsupported by the tobacco industry.   An estimated 50 million people smoke in the United States whilean estimated 12 million use smokeless tobacco.   Chewing or dipping tobacco is most prevalent in thesouth-central and southwestern states where 28 percent and 27percent of college men used smokeless tobacco, Glover's surveyfound.   In the Northeast, only 15 percent of college men used thetobacco products, while 16 percent used them in central states,according to the survey.   Snuff, which is cured, ground tobacco, is placed in pinchfulsbetween the cheek and gums, called dipping. Chewing tobacco, soldin packets of leaf, plug or twists, is placed in wads in the cheek.   Glover said most people think smokeless tobacco as a safealternative to smoking. Nearly eight of 10 of the studentssurveyed, 79 percent, believed chewing or dipping was less harmfulthan smoking.   ``You're just trading off different kinds of cancer,'' Gloversaid. ``Obviously, if you chew your chance of lung cancer goes waydown. But your chance of oral cancer goes way up.''   Glover found 90 percent of those students surveyed agreedsmokeless tobacco ``harms the mouth'' and 80 percent said it``causes cancer.''   But only 14 percent agreed smokeless tobacco is ``veryharmful,'' while 79 percent believe it is ``somewhat harmful'' or``slightly harmful.''   Demand for snuff and chewing tobacco among young men has beenstrengthened by the products' masculine image, Glover said, in partbecause they are popular among professional athletes.   He said the amount of chewing tobacco consumed nationallyincreased 22 percent annually from the 1970s until 1986-87 when itdeclined slightly.   Glover conducted the research by distributing surveys in spring1987 to schools with 2,000 students or more in eight states pickedrandomly from eight regions in the country. The questionnaires weredistributed at physical education classes.   The states where the survey were distributed were Ohio,Oklahoma, Minnesota, Colorado, Arizona, Oregon, Connecticut andSouth Carolina.</TEXT></DOC>
