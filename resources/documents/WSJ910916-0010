Unemployment levels are rising in the major Europeaneconomies, and growth expectations are being scaled back.&quot;It's a queer situation,&quot; says Albert Merlin, director ofeconomics for Paris-based Cie. de Saint-Gobain, a bigbuilding materials and glass-making concern. While the U.S.is slowly coming back from recession, Europeans are in aneconomic limbo that may not end until well into next year.</LP><TEXT>   Certainly the successful conclusion of the Persian GulfWar late last winter and the reversal of Moscow's Communistcoup last month brought collective sighs of relief. Recently,European bourses have regained some of their bounce, andeconomists are increasingly saying the recent slump has doneits worst.   But around some of Europe's major companies, officialsfeel the recovery is feeble, fraught with false dawns -- andperhaps non-existent as the 12-nation European Communitystarts implementing its plan to become a unified market nextyear.   &quot;Is there a recovery in Europe?&quot; asks Lennart Ribohn,chief financial officer of Electrolux Co. in Stockholm. &quot;Theanswer is no. Total demand is down further compared with1990, and we expect that to continue through the end of thisyear.&quot;   At the more optimistic end of the spectrum, AlessandroOlvi, senior vice president at IRI, the state-ownedconglomerate based in Rome, says &quot;a slow pickup should becoming,&quot; but he concedes that few tangible signs of it arevisible yet. Meanwhile, Cofindustria, Italy's major industryassociation, is morose. &quot;We have no indication of an upturnin industrial production,&quot; says Stefano Micossi, chiefeconomist for the association. &quot;Maybe we'll have norecovery.&quot;   Even as Americans have grown more confident about theirrecovery, Europeans have become more hesitant about theirs.Compared with the other major economic blocs, Europe's 1992looks decidedly lackluster. Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. inLondon estimates that the U.S. economy will grow 3% nextyear, the Japanese economy 3.5%, and the European economyonly 1.9%. Within Europe, Sweden is predicted to post growthof only 0.7%, and Switzerland's economy is expected to grindout only 1.5% growth.   Further into the decade, Europe should be poised foranother growth spurt, as companies reap the benefits of thesingle market and make inroads into the former communist blocto the east. It's the immediate outlook that seems glum --and that flies in the face of the determined optimism thatcame out of recent international economic gatherings,particularly the ministerial meeting of the Organization forEconomic Cooperation and Development in June and the Group ofSeven economic summit in July. Both meetings predicted aglobal recovery in coming months.   &quot;It was the Anglo-Saxons who were writing the copy&quot; atthose sessions, says Richard O'Brien, chief economist ofAmerican Express Bank in London. The U.S. and Canada aremoving into recovery, and the British government insists thatthe U.K. economy will pick up late this year after arecession that started earlier and cut deeper than any on theContinent. Other Europeans, Mr. O'Brien says, need to bereminded that &quot;you don't get a recovery till you've had yourslowdown.&quot;   And that's the rub. Germany -- which has served asEurope's locomotive for the past year -- is only now slidinginto a slowdown that threatens to drag others into a slump,or keep them sluggish if they are trying to shake off arecession. After estimated growth of 3.2% this year, theGerman economy is predicted to grow only 1.8% next year.   The slowdown will make itself felt throughout Europe. Forthe past year, a surge in demand from the former East Germanykept sales up for many companies despite the slump that tookhold in Britain, France and Italy. Now that German demand isslowing, Europeans are wondering where the economic stimulusis going to come from.   Practically guaranteeing that the German engine will slowdown is the stern Bundesbank, which warned against theinflationary effects of a post-unification spending binge.Now that price data show that inflation is indeed a threat,the central bank has ratcheted key interest rates upward andmay do so again.   Throughout the Benelux countries and France, which sent aflood of exports to Germany, the mood is growing more sober.&quot;I shared the euphoria when the Berlin Wall fell,&quot; saysAndrew Land, chairman of Hagemeyer N.V., an internationaltrading concern in Amsterdam. &quot;Our consumer products pouredinto Germany. This year we've seen an exact reversal.&quot;   The slowing of the German locomotive is particularlyworrisome because businesses don't see an alternate source ofeconomic stimulus. &quot;We've had a slowdown in economic activityin almost all the European economies,&quot; says Werner Grassl,senior economist with BMW AG in Munich. &quot;Germany has been akind of island because of its massive Keynesian fiscalpolicy. Now this island situation is disappearing.&quot;   In a perfect world, the German slump would be offset byrecovery in the U.S. and Britain. However, the Britishrebound is likely to be feeble -- leading to growth of onlyabout 1% next year, some economists say -- and the U.S.recovery isn't thought to be strong enough to spur a surge inimports from Europe. Says Electrolux's Mr. Ribohn: &quot;We'reafraid that the weakening demand in Germany won't be offsetby activity anywhere else.&quot;   Besides, many European companies look to Germany for ahigher share of revenue than to the U.S. For France'sSaint-Gobain, for example, Germany accounts for about 18% oftotal sales; the U.S., only 10%.   The upshot isn't an economic disaster. Rather, says MichelDeVelle, chief economist with Cie. Financiere de Paribas,Europeans can expect to live for a while in an economic limbo&quot;that's not a recession, not an expansion, but something inbetween.&quot; The main danger is that with only sluggish economicgrowth, European companies will fail to contain costs andbecome uncompetitive.   Signs of more robust activity have popped up here andthere, but they have had a mirage quality that businessesfind exasperating. In France, for example, car sales rosesharply in July, only to come in 14% lower in August than inthe same month a year earlier.   On the surface, Europe's sluggish performance resemblesthe &quot;Eurosclerosis&quot; days of the early 1980s -- an afflictionthe EC's single-market project was partly intended to cure.However, the similarities are superficial. In the earlierbout, European companies carried top-heavy and inefficientstructures that didn't perform particularly well even in thebest of times. This time, much of the needed restructuringwork has occurred. &quot;It could be slow in 1992, but after that,if there's no new Saddam Hussein or big world event, youcould have a period of growth for three or four years,&quot; saysSaint-Gobain's Mr. Merlin.   And even the glummest Europeans view the current slump asa lull before a signficant expansion. Not only will post-1992Western Europe be more dynamic, but the eventualincorporation of Eastern Europe and the Soviet republicspromises huge expansion opportunities later in the decade.   &quot;There are some 410 million people in the larger EastBloc,&quot; says J. Paul Horne, economist with Smith Barney,Harris Upham in Paris. &quot;Sometime that will be a market,providing new demand that a month ago was unthinkable.&quot; Bycontrast, he says, in the days of Eurosclerosis, &quot;it wasimpossible to identify new sources of demand.&quot;   Another change is that the European economies have subduedthe inflation dragon that used to roar through at everyupturn in the growth cycle. By linking their monetarypolicies to those of the Bundesbank, France, Britain, Italyand Spain have managed to push their inflation levels to newlows. Inflation-prone France now boasts an inflation ratelower than Germany's, and Britain is likely to be in the sameposition by the end of this year.   Hagemeyer's Mr. Land says that despite the current go-slowclimate, he's betting heavily on Europe. &quot;I think Europe isthe most exciting market for the next 10 to 20 years,&quot; hesays, &quot;more exciting than the U.S., more exciting than Japan,more exciting than the Far East.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
