Hong Kong residents watched in horror as Chinese soldiers stampedout the pro-democracy movement in June, and many responded byapplying for passports and demanding that Britain offer them refuge.   ``It's a tragedy we have here,'' said Joseph Y.S. Cheng, apolitical scientist. ``To most of my friends, there are only twoways out. One is to emigrate; the other is to keep quiet, keep yourfingers crossed and hope for the best.''   Britain agreed five years ago to return Hong Kong to China in1997, when the lease on much of the crown colony expires.   In return, the Chinese said Hong Kong could keep its capitalistsystem and enjoy a ``high degree of autonomy'' for 50 years under apolicy of ``one country, two systems.''   Since then, the people of Hong Kong have busied themselves withwhat they have always done best: making money. The economy achievedimpressive growth that reached 13.5 percent in 1987 and broughtgreat prosperity to many of the 5.7 million people.   Economic links with China strengthened dramatically. Legions ofHong Kong entrepreneurs started factories in adjacent Guangdongprovince and hundreds of Chinese companies set up shop in theterritory.   Such bonds increased the importance of Hong Kong in China'spolicy of modernizing and opening itself to the world, a processwidely seen as the best guarantee of the ``one country, twosystems'' policy.   Then came the night of June 3-4 in Beijing, when the armyattacked and the government acknowledged that hundreds of peoplewere killed. The assault, and mass arrests that followed, causedhundreds of thousands in Hong Kong to shed their political apathyand take to the streets in protest.   ``It has shown very clearly that there's no guarantee from China.They are capable of doing anything,'' said Thomas Chan, a researcherat the Center of Asian Studies at the University of Hong Kong.   Many people are leaving the colony and companies are evaluatingtheir future, said Robert Broadfoot, managing director of abusiness-risk consulting group.   A surge in the emigration of skilled workers would cause a lossof the local investment and personnel needed for the city to grow.The government estimates 45,000 people emigrated in 1988, up from anaverage of 20,000 in each of the previous five years.   Sharp increases in immigration inquiries and applications werereported last month by consulates of such popular destinations asCanada and Australia. Even smaller countries like Jamaica and Belizefound interest growing.   Diane Harrison, personnel manager of a Hong Kong shippingcompany, said three of its 170 employees had resigned to moveabroad, four were planning to leave and 17 had started theemigration process.   ``Everybody is worried about the future,'' she said.   People without the money, skills or connections to go where theychoose are asking Britain to provide refuge as an ``insurancepolicy.''   Officials in the colony say granting the right to live in Britainis essential to restoring confidence among residents, many of whosefamilies fled Communist China. Britain has refused.   ``There is simply no way that the British government could grantto several million people the right to come and live in Britain,''Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said on a recent visit to HongKong.   He said Britain would take all measures possible to safeguard thecolony, and urged the people not to ``underestimate your ability tobuild that future.''   ``Hong Kong has seen hard times before,'' Howe said. ``You'vealways shown the resilience and the resourcefulness to live throughsuch times and emerge from them stronger than ever before.''   A recent poll indicated only 6 percent of residents would move toBritain if given the right, and that most people had no intention ofleaving Hong Kong. Chan said the pro-democracy movement had causedmany to rediscover their Chinese identity.   The political awakening in Hong Kong touched all levels ofsociety. In addition to huge street demonstrations, a televisionpersonality organized seminars on democracy and activists collectedvolumes of signatures for various protests.   Revulsion about the Beijing crackdown was widespread, fromnewspapers long supported by Beijing to taxi drivers who attachedtiny black flags to their antennas.   Britain, which some residents say has not done enough for thecolony, appeared likely to speed democratic reform so the peoplewould have a greater voice in their future. The legislature isdominated by government officials and appointed members.   Cheng, the political scientist, has fought a long battle for moredemocracy but now says: ``What guarantee will it offer? If Beijingis ready to crush the students with tanks and machine guns, what'sthe point of having a democratic system in Hong Kong?''   Others believe continued support in Hong Kong for China'sdissidents might be dangerous.   ``Beijing leaders could perceive a political threat in Hong Kongthat outweighs economic benefits,'' Broadfoot said. ``If Hong Kongrefuses to keep out of China's political affairs, it could beextremely damaging.''   Observers say the fall of the hard-line leadership in Beijing, orenacting a bill of rights and redrafting the post-1997 constitutionfor Hong Kong could help the territory's success extend well intothe 21st century.   But for now, Cheng said, ``almost everyone is very depressed.''</TEXT></DOC>
