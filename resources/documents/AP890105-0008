(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A former janitor serving a 35-year prisonterm for a murder that authorities now believe was committed by theso-called ``Southside Strangler'' was granted executive clemencyWednesday.   David Vasquez' pardon was based in part on the recommendation ofArlington County Commonwealth's Attorney Helen Fahey, said Gov.Gerald L. Baliles.   Vasquez, 42, pleaded guilty in 1985 to second-degree murder inthe death of Washington lawyer Carolyn Jean Hamm of Arlington.   Vasquez at first confessed to the killing, but recanted hisconfession and said he entered the guilty plea to avoid a possiblecapital murder conviction and death sentence.   Vasquez has been imprisoned at Buckingham Correctional Center inDillwyn.   New evidence, a review of existing evidence, furtherinvestigation and analysis by the Arlington County Police Departmentand the FBI National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crimeconvinced authorities that the crime was committed by TimothySpencer, who has been convicted of capital murder in the deaths ofSusan Tucker of Arlington and Debbie Davis of Richmond.   Spencer's convictions were based on DNA tests, also known as``genetic fingerprinting.'' In such tests, the molecular structureof body fluids and tissues from a crime scene are matched with thoseof the suspect. Like fingerprints, each structure is unique to theindividual.   After the murder of Ms. Tucker, Arlington police reconsideredwhether Vasquez murdered Ms. Hamm.   ``Every lead and available scientific process was pursued, andled to the conclusion that Spencer ... was responsible for the Hammmurder,'' a news release issued by the governor's office said.   Ms. Fahey's request for a pardon was reviewed by the VirginiaParole Board, the Secretary of the Commonwealth's Office, thegovernor's executive staff and Baliles, the news release said.   Vasquez received an ``absolute pardon,'' which restores hisconstitutional rights and leaves him without a criminal record. Ms.Fahey had predicted that Vasquez would receive a ``conditionalpardon,'' which is similar to being paroled from prison.</TEXT></DOC>
