Polychron was named president of the company's Planters andamp; Life Savers division, succeeding Martin L. Orlowsky.    Mr. Orlowsky, 45 years old, was promoted to that post earlier this year. The food and tobacco company said he had &quot;resigned to pursue other business interests.&quot; A spokeswoman declined to elaborate. Reached at his home in Parsippany, N.J., Mr. Orlowsky also wouldn't comment.    Mr. Polychron, 51, currently is the president of the Del Monte Fresh Fruit Co. unit. His appointment takes effect next Monday.    Mr. Orlowsky came up through the marketing ranks at R.J. Reynolds Industries Inc.; he was that company's senior vice president of marketing before it merged with Nabisco Brands Inc. in 1985. His departure continues a trend in which Reynolds executives haven't fared as well as Nabisco executives since the merger.    RJR Nabisco recently shifted Planters andamp; Life Savers from its foods sector to its tobacco sector, and it plans to move the division's headquarters from Parsippany to Winston-Salem. </TEXT></DOC>
