Using three energy options of current interestto AID as examples (carbonized coal briquettes to meet residential andcommercial sector energy needs, wood gasification to power stationaryinternal combustion engines, and rural electrification), the paper illustratesthe importance of several dimensions often neglected in engineering-economicanalysis, such as institutional requirements and a relatively detailedunderstanding of market segments. Unless such dimensions are incorporatedeffectively into technology transfer efforts by U.S. developers, relativelylittle success should be expected either in expanding markets for U.S.technology or in helping developing nations meet their energy needs.</TEXT></DOC>
