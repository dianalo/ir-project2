 The way we build computer systems is tantamount to trying to build747s with stone axes and wooden clubs.andP;  I'm trying to supply the modern meansto that end,&quot; he said.andM;Rubenstein has been successfully preaching his message at Metropolitan LifeInsurance Co. in New York.andP;  Under his direction, Met's ApplicationDevelopment Center introduced structured design methodology, Case tools,metrics, quality assurance and other ideas into the company's InvestmentSystems and Technology division.andP;  Other Met units are now looking into thoseideas.andM;Rubenstein's philosophy is based on the idea that quality introduced at thebeginning will improve quality at every step along the way.andM;&quot;In a large computer system there are literally tens of thousands offunctions that computer programmers and analysts perform,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If youcan improve all those functions and subfunctions in terms of quality by 2%and 1%, [and then] add them up, the subtotal of the incremental improvementsis enormous.andP;  And that's exactly what I'm trying to do.&quot;andM;But, he cautioned, &quot;There's no magic solution.andP;  You can't change just onething and it's all better.&quot;andP;  Those who believe that a software tool willprovide a magic solution have a &quot;tekkie-weenie mentality,&quot; he said.andM;Further, he explained, it is crucial to understand the underlying theoriesbefore putting anything into practice.andP;  &quot;That's why Case and other structureddesign tools and techniques have not been widely used--because the basis forCase is in the structured techniques.andP;  And if you don't know those, you can'tuse Case.andP;  If you give a gorilla a Stradivarius, you're not going to hearmusic very soon.&quot;andM;Four years ago, Rubenstein instituted structured design courses for MetLife's programmers.andP;  &quot;Programming is only 15% of the systems life cycle, so Iwanted to bring in other classes in analysis, design and testing.&quot;andP;  The ideawas to give people the basis for understanding the tools that would beintroduced later.andM;At the same time, he started serving on Met Life committees for standards andproductivity improvement--and he began talking about structured design andquality.andP;  But there was one problem: &quot;There was a resounding silence.andP;  When Iyelled, no one listened.andP;  Their solution was to get program generators.andP;  Theydidn't know what I was talking about, and I started getting very frustrated.&quot;andM;At least one person heard Rubenstein's message--Bob Husnagel, the assistantvice president of advanced systems technology.andP;  He was in charge of computersystems for Investment Systems and Technology, the Met division responsiblefor investing all the monies from group insurance policies, annuities andother sources.andP;  And soon, Rubenstein was working in Investment Systems.andM;&quot;There are between 13 and 15 divisions in Met Life,&quot; Rubenstein said, &quot;andthere are no systems development standards because everyone has their own wayof doing things.andP;  We're extremely decentralized.&quot;andM;&quot;I don't think that's a smart, economical way to do things,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Inthe term 'software engineering,' engineering implies a method, a discipline,a precision and rigor.andP;  Without it, you have zilch.&quot;andM;Rubenstein also experienced an uphill battle.andP;  &quot;When you say there's a betterway to do something, the implication is that what you were doing was notperfect, even wrong maybe, and people take personal umbrage.andP;  As manyproponents as I have, I have opponents also.&quot;andM;CHANGING CORPORATE CULTUREandM;Introducing software engineering called for a big cultural change.andP;  &quot;That'sthe hardest part.andP;  Unless you give people a hell of a good reason for change,if you keep promoting them and rewarding them for what they've been doing for30 years, why should they change?andP;  If you do it the new way--reward,approbation, title--that's how you change the culture.andP;  And if you try thenew way and get egg on your face, you're not penalized because at leastyou're trying.&quot;andM;His first step was to sell management on the need for the new tools andtechniques.andP;  &quot;I sold them on the fact that it would be a five- to seven-yearcommitment, and that it would be the hardest thing they ever did.andP;  And theygave me the support I needed--and a $30 million laboratory.&quot;andM;One of the ways he sold the program was by convincing management that qualitybegets productivity.andP;  &quot;If you do it right the first time you're already moreproductive because you don't have to do the same job twice.&quot;andM;Thus, he told management, &quot;if you do development 10%, 20% better, you havethat much more to add to new development, so you're that much morecompetitive.&quot;andM;After getting the go-ahead, Rubenstein developed a uniform systemsmethodology.andP;  &quot;They didn't want to spend the half million dollars to go outand buy one, so I developed an eclectic methodology.andP;  I had worked for ArthurYoung [New York], which sold one, and I had used five or six different ones,so I put pieces of them together like a big jigsaw puzzle.andP;  And it worked.&quot;andM;And then the application Development Center, consisting of a dozen people,was born to help train Investment Systems' 250 programmers in the Case toolsthat the company bought.andM;Rubenstein calls the ADC &quot;the most incredible collection of people I've everworked with, and my proudest time in the computer industry.&quot;andP;  He said hetried to introduce some of the concepts about esprit de corps, which helearned while working on the Saturn Apollo at Cape Canaveral as a programmer.andM;Now, he said, Investment Systems has spent about $30,000 per programmer ontools and education--and, after two years, the &quot;infrastructure is in place.andO;People are now getting used to a methodology, programmers and analysts inmost cases welcome inspections and do joint application design [JAD].andO;They're using Case and understand structured techniques.&quot;andM;Met Life is an IBM shop, with 3090 mainframes running VM.andP;  The InvestmentSystems and Technology division does all development on IBM PS/2s, using theCambridge, Mass.-based Bachman Information Systems' toolset for databasedesign.andM;The division also uses Excelerator from Index Technology, Inc., Cambridge,Mass.; the Analyst from Visible Systems, Waltham, Mass.; and the InformationEngineering Workbench from KnowledgeWare, Atlanta.andM;Investment Systems recently formed a performance measurement group to measurequality, performance and end-user satisfaction.andM;&quot;It's been rumored that our investment people are the happiest users ofcomputer systems in all of Met,&quot; Rubenstein said.andM;Further, Rubenstein's work at Met Life is now being viewed as a prototype.andO;&quot;For the first year the other divisions just watched, but now we're gettingcalls and are going around giving presentations.andP;  They're getting curious;there's a ground swell.&quot;andM;That ground swell comes none too soon for Rubenstein, who has been involvedin the computer industry for 25 years and in Case for 15.andM;His first taste of computers came when he was taking graduate courses at CityCollege in New York.andP;  &quot;I met a programmer in a course I was taking and he gotme a job moonlighting as a programmer at Bell Labs.andP;  I loved it.&quot;andM;Rubenstein says that while he was working at Chase Manhattan Bank about 15years ago, he became the first commercial Case user of a system calledproblem Statement language/Problem Statement Analyzer.andP;  It was developed bythe University of Michigan for the Air Force.andM;(Meta Systems, Ann Arbor, Mich., now has the exclusive rights to market andenhance the PSL/PSA Case tools.)andM;&quot;Although it was a mainframe package and was by today's standards archaic, itworked.andP;  And it seemed to me an intelligent way of doing things.andM;&quot;So when I knew that Arthur Young was funding a PC software project usingstate-of-the-art technology, I had to go work there,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Arthur Youngwas in partnership with KnowledgeWare to develop the Information EngineeringWorkbench with James Martin.andP;  I wanted to be a part of that.&quot;andP;  Rubensteinleft Arthur Young because of the amount of time he spent away from his familytraveling.andP;  So he rejoined Met Life, where he put into practice what he hadlearned at Arthur Young.andM;Several months ago, Rubenstein moved up a notch in the Met Life hierarchy andis now part of a four-member architecture group.andP;  His job is to oversee allthe applications developed in-house as well as those bought from outsidevendors, to ensure that they all fit within the systems development frameworkhe helped established.andM;He remains devoted to structured design.andP;  &quot;I think any company can do what'sbeen done here, if they want to provide more than lip service and if they'rewilling to see on a horizon of five to seven years.andP;  The problem is thatpeople try to put in one or two of these things and then say where's theproductivity?andP;  Where's the quality?andP;  You've got to be committed to it all.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
