There were hints of a bipartisan agreement to delay or limit Social Security cost-of-living increases (COLAs), a step that would save only $2 billion a year but would show rare seriousness about controlling federal spending.    It was not to be. Democratic Rep. Claude Pepper, the 87-year-old enforcer for the senior-citizen lobbies, began beating his war drums. &quot;There will be political fallout if this is pursued,&quot; he warned. GOP House Whip Trent Lott, worried that Democrats would entice Republicans into supporting Social Security cuts only to back out of the deal in the end, threw cold water on the idea and COLA reform slid off the negotiating table.    Major reforms in Social Security can't be ducked indefinitely. They will be needed before most baby boomers retire around the year 2020. Under the Social Security Administration's most commonly used assumptions the program's obligations by the year 2035 will exceed projected revenues by some 50%.    Either policy makers will have to slash promised benefits or raise payroll taxes to undreamed-of levels. A. Haeworth Robertson, a former chief actuary for the Social Security Administration, believes that by 2035 combined payroll-tax rates may have to rise from 15% to 35%.    The Republicans won't touch Social Security. The Democrats' Social Security demagoguery in recent elections has convinced Republicans such as Trent Lott that they risk political suicide if they so much as sample a drop of COLA reform. Republican Ronald Reagan blinked when he had the opportunity to control the program early in his term. Social Security is a sacred cow, which means that its protective priesthood -- the Democrats -- will have to replace it with a more credible system. This is the same political dynamic that moved Richard Nixon to break with his party's past and go to China in 1972, and Democrat Jimmy Carter to push through airline and trucking deregulation.    Of the current Democratic presidential candidates only Bruce Babbitt has shown any interest in the issue. Mr. Babbitt proposes to &quot;means-test&quot; Social Security by taxing more of the benefits of higher-income recipients. Gradually Social Security will have to incorporate more means-testing and shift to general-revenue financing in recognition that it is fundamentally a welfare program.    Politicians eventually will also have to respond to younger workers' growing resentment of Social Security. They have been hit with seven payroll-tax hikes in the past 10 years and face a zero rate of return on their contributions. The maximum combined payroll tax was only $348 in 1965; next January it will be $6,750. Pete du Pont, a GOP candidate for president, says that if young workers are not given some incentives to provide for their own retirement they will withdraw political support for a burdensome system they already view skeptically. He favors an optional variation on Individual Retirement Accounts to replace some Social Security coverage.    The U.S. can't persist with a retirement system that is one-part Ponzi scheme, one-part welfare program and one-part demographic time bomb. Politicians -- especially Democrats -- will have to either build a better Social Security mousetrap or risk a future generational war between elderly haves and younger have-nots. </TEXT></DOC>
