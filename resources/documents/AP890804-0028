The government also said it would suspend the military draft forfive months, starting in September, to ease tensions with theopposition and to help keep the war from flaring up.   Ortega, who will attend a two-day Central American summit thisweekend, said he will insist at the summit that camps housing12,000 Contras and thousands of their dependents in southernHonduras be disbanded.   Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyo has also been saying forsome time that his country finds the Contras a burden.   The summit, involving the presidents of El Salvador, Nicaragua,Guatemala and Costa Rica, is part of a regional peace plan thataims to negotiate an end to the Contra conflict and to the leftistguerrilla war in El Salvador. It is being held in the Caribbeanbeach resort of Tela.   The talks Saturday and Sunday will concentrate mostly onNicaragua.   Both the United States and Contra leaders are resisting the moveto disband the Contras and want to postpone such a move until afterNicaragua's government holds free and fair elections Feb. 25, aspromised.   The agreement to back disbandment was reached after 22 hours oftalks between Sandinistas and leaders of 20 opposition parties. Thetalks recessed Thursday night.   Sandinista leaders also said they planned to suspend themilitary draft from September until after the February elections inan effort to ease tensions with the opposition and de-escalate thewar.   The talks were called by the Sandinistas to reform Nicaragua'selection laws to accomodate opposition objections that theircandidates were not allowed to campaign freely in past elections.   Past constraints on the opposition included news censorship.   The agreement on disbanding the Contras ``calls on thepresidents of Central America to push forward the plan todemobilize and repatriate voluntarily'' the rebels.   It also called on ``the region's governments to abstain fromcarrying out undercover activities during Nicaragua's electoralprocess.''   The Sandinistas also pledged to grant unconditional amnesty toall people arrested for inciting political disorder.   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-Americanaffairs, visited Guatemala and other Central American nations thisweek to urge against disbanding the Contras until after elections.   Adolfo Calero, a member of the rebel political directorate, saidhe was ``elated that President Bush has come out unequivocally infavor of having the resistance remain as a viable force.''   The process of democratization in Nicaragua, promised by theleftist Sandinista government, remains to be seen, Calero said.``You do not take down the scaffold before the building isfinished,'' he said.   A senior State Department official in Washsington, briefingreporters on the Aronson trip, cited complaints that the Sandinistagovernment is mounting raids against suspected Contra sympathizersin northern Nicaragua and has failed to create fair conditions forpolitical opponents.   All U.S. military aid to the Contras was cut off a year ago andthe rebels now receive a trickle of non-lethal assistance, such asfood and boots.</TEXT></DOC>
