Midland Bank PLC, National Westminster Bank PLC, Barclays BankPLC and Lloyds Bank PLC cut the benchmark rate, effective Monday,after the central bank reduced its own money market rate by 0.375percent to 8 percent, apparently to stem the British pound'sadvance.   The base rate cut brought the rate to its lowest level since itstood at 7.5 percent in April, 1978, the banks said.   The banks last cut the rate, by half a point, on March 17.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has been concernedabout the strength of the pound against the West German mark sinceearly March. The pound has been buoyed by Britain's relatively highinterest rates, which make pound-denominated investments moreattractive, stimulating demand for the currency.   A stronger pound could hurt Britain's exports and corporateprofits.   However, there have been concerns that rate cuts would spurinflation, which is running at a modest 3.3 percent.   Mrs. Thatcher repeatedly has said that reining in inflation isher top economic priority.   Better commercial borrowers generally obtain loans at 1percentage point above the base rate.</TEXT></DOC>
