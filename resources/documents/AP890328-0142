ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese IIItestified at Oliver North's trial Tuesday that the specter ofimpeachment hung over the White House in the 72 hours after aidesdiscovered a planned diversion of Iran arms sale money to theNicaraguan Contras.   In two hours of testimony, Meese said he told then-PresidentReagan about the diversion the day after North confirmed that theplan, outlined in a memo, had become a fact.   ``Your worst nightmare had come true?'' asked North lawyerBrendan Sullivan.   ``Yes, it was,'' Meese replied.   ``You knew that spelled trouble?''   ``Yes, I did.''   The nightmares that Sullivan referred to was the revelation thattwo activities in which North was deeply involved had beenintertwined: the administration's secret sale of weapons to Iranand the fact that money from the arms sales _ with the knowledge ofU.S. officials _ secretly was going to the rebels fighting theNicaraguan government at a time such aid was forbidden by law.   ``Merging of those two factors could cause toppling of thepresident himself?'' asked Sullivan.   ``Yes,'' Meese replied.   The memo, which had survived massive shredding efforts by North,his secretary and an aide, was found on Nov. 22, 1986 by Meeseaides William Bradford Reynolds in North's office. The next day, aSunday, Meese met with North and others at the Justice Department.   Meese said that in the Sunday meeting, North appeared surprisedthat Meese had obtained the memo which outlined the arms salesprofit diversion plan.   ``I believe he asked where we had gotten the memo,'' said Meese.   He testified also that North assured him then that the plan wasIsrael's and U.S. involvement was ``none.'' And he said North toldhim he had contacted Contra leader Adolfo Calero and suggestedCalero open three accounts in Switzerland to get the money from theIsraelis.   In truth, North co-defendants Richard Secord and Albert Hakimhad arranged to receive the Iran money in private Swiss accountsthey established and controlled, investigators found.   Meese said he talked to the president on Monday and they talkedof the impact the public disclosure might have.   ``I don't know whether the actual word impeachment was used,''Meese testified. But he said there was concern over ``thetremendous consequences'' of the discovery.   The former attorney general said the administration also wasconcerned that its political opponents might get hold of theinformation about the diversion before it could be made public.   ``I felt it vital that there not be any appearance of acoverup,'' he said. It was decided that decided that Reagan wouldhold a news conference. At the Nov. 25 news conference, Reaganannounced that North had been fired, and that his boss, Adm. JohnPoindexter, had resigned.   Among the 12 criminal counts on which North is being tried infederal court are destruction of documents, attempting to derailMeese's investigation and making false statements to the attorneygeneral.   A former North deputy told the jury earlier that the NationalSecurity Council aide carried sensitive documents to a shreddereven as Meese's investigators were taking a lunch break fromsearching his office.   Marine Lt. Col. Robert Earl said North slipped through analleyway to a White House shredder that day. Among the papers Earlsaid he had previously turned over to North were documents on thesecret arms initiative.   Meese said that he learned about the diversion of funds to theNicaraguan rebels from the memo his men found. On page five, hesaid he found the plan for taking profits from the weapons salesand using them to buy supplies for the Contras. This was at a timewhen U.S. intelligence agencies were forbidden by Congress to spendmoney in military support of the rebels.   North assured him, Meese said, that the plan for the diversionwas Israel's. Israel was a conduit for arms involved in thetransactions.   ``He said Israel would decide how much money would go to theresistance and our involvement, the CIA and the NSC, was none,''Meese testified.   Earl, who was a deputy to North in the NSC structure, said Northcame from a meeting in the West Wing of the White House on Nov. 21and asked Earl for his Iran files, which included records on thesecret arms initiative to Iran.   ``I asked him what was going on,'' Earl testified. ``He said itwas time for Ollie to be a scapegoat.''   North asked him to look for ``sensitive intelligencedocuments,'' Earl said, and when he brought them out, North putthem on top of a stack of papers on his desk.   He said he understood that North was going to ``sanitize'' thepapers.   ``To destroy documents, that was your understanding?''   ``Yes, sir,'' said Earl.   Earl said he began to destroy documents, too, and when he leftthe office, North was till there.   The next day, a Saturday, Richardson and Reynolds searched theoffice and discovered the diversion memo.   The investigators crossed paths with North only as they walkeddown the hall for lunch as North was arriving, Earl said,exchanging only a few words.   ``At that time you saw Lt. Col. North going around cullingadditional papers to destroy?'' asked prosecutor David Zornow.``Yes,'' Earl said.   He said he saw North go outside through an alleyway and head fora shredder in the White House situation room, where nationalsecurity crises are monitored.   ``It was your understanding those papers would never be seenagain,'' asked Zornow.   ``Yes, sir,'' said Earl.   In a related development, the Supreme Court ruled Tuesday thatfederal criminal defendants who fail to persuade a judge to dismisstheir indictments because of alleged misconduct by prosecutorscannot appeal before their trial. The decision likely means thecourt will turn down an appeal by North, who is challenging ajudge's refusal to dismiss his indictment.   North has alleged that independent counsel Lawrence Walsh actedimproperly in using North's testimony to congressional committeesto indict him. North testified before the congressional panelsunder a grant of immunity from prosecution.</TEXT></DOC>
