Under the plan, for each share of common stock held, holders will receive one right to buy a fractional share of a new series of preferred stock for $25. The rights would be exercisable in the event of takeover.    The Dublin, Ohio, fast-food chain said the plan wasn't adopted in response to any known takeover effort, but was aimed at encouraging a prospective buyer to negotiate with the company. </TEXT></DOC>
