No one died. No one wasmarried either.   The doors to City Hall, like so many others in this once-vibrantand remarkably resilient metropolis, were barred.   ``Haven't had one customer the entire day,'' said police officerW. Cunningham, the lone sentry posted at the rear entrance to SanFrancisco's grand City Hall. ``No babies, no couples. In fact, noone's asked about any kind of license.   ``And anyway,'' he added, ``who'd be in this much of a hurry toget married?''</TEXT><TEXT>   Licenses aside, San Franciscans went about their business withfew differences from their counterparts elsewhere in the UnitedStates, just one day after a catastrophic earthquake wrenchedCalifornia's western elbow. And many managed the feat without theamenities everyone else was taking for granted: electricity andrunning water, telephones and easy access to fast food.   Some people, in fact, barely noticed the difference. Chris Walk,who with wife Flo, fled Chicago 2{ years ago for warmertemperatures and the vague promise of work, pointed toward a rollof blankets under a tree in Civic Cneter Plaza and said, ``That'smy home.''   ``And after what happened,'' he added, ``I'd rather be livingout here anyway.''   A bottle of cooking oil and a box of bread-crumb coating mix satopened on a bench nearby as Flo Walk fried up red snapper on asmall metal grate atop a tall steel cylinder. Behind her, the lateafternoon sun glistened off City Hall's polished walls.   ``A lot of people will be eating like us tonight,'' she said.``But the funny thing is we had enough money last night for a hotelroom. That's where we were when all the shaking started. Can youbelieve that?''</TEXT><TEXT>   In the waterfront Marina District, where homes run into themillions of dollars and the Golden Gate Bridge is visible in thedistance from some of the gently sloping streets, Barbara Fortestands behind a police line and shakes her head.   ``My home is trashed, absolutely trashed,'' she said. ``But I'mone of the lucky ones. I got out.''   She didn't need to be reminded that the neighborhood was SanFrancisco's hardest-hit community. The three-story apartmentbuilding in front of her _ once her home _ was now reduced to two.At the far western end of the block-long structure, the only proofthat the structure had garages on the first floor is the gray Fordthat sits flattened beneath it.   Little more than a block away, a second apartment buildingteeters precariously and next to that one, smoke crawled lazilytoward a coastal sky from the wreckage of an apartment building.   Over a loudspeaker, police warned residents and media alike toevacuate the area or be arrested.   Forte, in her 60s and a resident of Marina for much of thattime, leaned across the tape and asked a favor from a militarypoliceman in full fatigues.   ``Just watch out for looters, will you young man?''   Jeffery Mehegan, who hails from Massachusetts and onceconsidered himself lucky to be posted on the coast, smiled backreassuringly, ``Yes ma'am, I certainly will.''</TEXT></DOC>
