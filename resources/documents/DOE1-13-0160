The Gas Research Institute has developed a detailedrepresentation of the lower-48 oil and gas resource base and the activitiesnecessary to explore and develop that resource base. Combined with ahighly detailed assessment of gas well completions, the analysis indicatesthat lower-48 oil and gas production could be maintained at their 1986-87levels through the year 2000 without a return to the peak drilling activitylevels of the 1981-85 period and with little increase in real oil pricesabove the 1985 level. The development of new technology and improvedproduction practices to improve the recovery of hydrocarbons-in-placein known oil and gas fields will play a critical role in sustaining lower-48oil and gas production at their 1986-87 levels through the year 2000.</TEXT></DOC>
