Patients who haveproblems report them to their doctors, who report these inmedical journals, too.   Clearly, the main reason this process failed withsilicone-gel breast implants was that the devices weren'tregulated until 1976, so no studies were required. Even then,the devices were placed in a low-priority category forregulation. And because 80% were used in cosmetic procedures,which are mostly performed outside hospitals and aren't paidfor by insurance companies, they escaped the scrutiny thoseinstitutions customarily bring to bear.</LP><TEXT>   Also, most patients who suffered complications didn't linkthem to their implants; instead, they reported their symptomsto their family doctors and to rheumatologists. And when DowCorning Corp. researchers did find evidence that the implantsmight rupture, they didn't make it public, according tointernal documents from that company. (Dow Corning is a jointventure of Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc.)   Despite the secrecy on the part of that manufacturer, someplastic surgeons discovered for themselves that siliconeimplants could break, releasing silicone into the body. Forinstance, A. Michael Pardue of Thousand Oaks, Calif.,returned several silicone implants to McGhan Medical Corp. in1976 because they ruptured. In a Sept. 27, 1976, letter toMcGhan President Donald McGhan, Dr. Pardue wrote, &quot;Don, thiscase today was one of the most frightening cases that I haveever had. The inflammatory and scar tissue response to theruptured implant was incredible.&quot;   In a written response to Dr. Pardue dated Oct. 8, 1976,McGhan promised to analyze the returned implant and notedthat there was no scientific proof that implants cause tissuereaction. Reached for comment yesterday, a McGhan spokesmansaid several generations of the implant have been introducedsince 1976, but couldn't comment on the Pardue correspondencespecifically.   Dr. Pardue says he didn't report the case to medicaljournals because &quot;I'm not one to write for journals.&quot;Neither, as it turned out, were many of his peers. Whiledozens of articles did appear outlining possible problemswith silicone breast implants, many were written by peopleoutside the specialty -- rheumatologists, oncologists,radiologists and others. That is partly because many plasticsurgeons, like many other professionals, fear that reportingtheir own bad results is tantamount to inviting litigation.   &quot;We joke that there ought to be a Journal for Bad Results.But in this crazy country, you're opening yourself up tolawsuits,&quot; says Melvin J. Silverstein, an oncologist at theBreast Center, Van Nuys, Calif.   Robert Goldwyn, editor of the Journal of the AmericanSociety of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, has writteneditorials chastising his colleagues for not reporting badresults and for reporting successes based on preliminary casestudies instead of long-term research.   At least one colleague agreed. &quot;Many plastic surgeons(myself included) have become mesmerized by the good resultswe usually obtain&quot; with cosmetic implants, William M. Cockewrote in a letter to the ASPRS Journal in 1984. &quot;Because ofthese successes, we have been less than objective in ourevaluation of the body's reaction to silicone gel.&quot; Dr. Cockeconcluded that &quot;we have a problem&quot; and called on surgeons to&quot;objectively review our results.&quot;   Dr. Goldwyn, in an interview, says that plastic surgeons&quot;can't assume responsibility for everything&quot; that goes wrong.&quot;But they can assume responsibility for telling everything.&quot;   ---   (See related article: &quot;Informed Consent?
