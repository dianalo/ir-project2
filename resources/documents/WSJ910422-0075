It is not certain whether Bank of Boston's efforts,culminating in financial agreements signed this past weekend,will satisfy the Fed. To finance its bid, should it succeed,Bank of Boston initially planned to raise $1 billion in newcapital, half from a private placement to a group ofinvestors and half from selling rights to currentshareholders. But the Fed has questioned whether the bank'sproposal to raise as much as $500 million through a publicrights offering &quot;is capital the bank can really count on tofund its bid,&quot; said a person involved in the negotiations.</LP><TEXT>   The main concern of regulators is that some unexpectedevent, such as changes in the bank's condition or a weakenedstock market, might leave the bank unable to raise theexpected money through its rights offering. Without thismoney, regulators say, it would not have sufficient capitalto buy the failed bank.   However, individuals close to Bank of Boston believe thebank has overcome the Fed's concerns by having its investorgroup agree to increase its commitment to $600 million,allowing the amount of public rights offering to be loweredto $400 million. The bank also has obtained specialagreements from underwriters to buy any shares that aren'tpurchased by stockholders in the rights offering for as longas six months.   Although it is the task of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp. to decide which bidder -- Bank of Boston, BankAmericaCorp. or the team of Fleet/Norstar Financial Group andKohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. -- purchases the remains of thefailed Bank of New England, approval from the Fed, whichregulates bank holding companies, is necessary. Officialsfrom both the Fed and FDIC have been negotiating though theweekend with all the bidders to clarify the complex terms ofeach proposal. The FDIC plans to meet today to consider thebids. The agency expects to issue a decision by Wednesday.   Once a winner is announced, negotiations with the FDICover final terms of acquisition are expected to take as longas three months. Only then would Bank of Boston be able tofile for its rights offering to be approved by the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, and eventually proceed to mail theoffer to shareholders and await response. The length of theprocess increases the Fed's uncertainty about the bid, aperson close to the talks said.   Beyond raising the size of the private placement andlowering the amount of the public rights offering, Bank ofBoston has responded by having two investment banks andseveral other financial institutions sign a specialunderwriting agreement called a forward standby commitment.The commitment, which immediately obligates the underwritersto buy any unsold shares for up to six months, &quot;carries somerisks for the underwriters but definitely shows that the fullpublic rights offering will succeed.&quot;   Neither Bank of Boston officials nor federal regulatorswould comment about the negotiations surrounding the bank'sbid. &quot;We are simply not going to comment on any aspect ofthis,&quot; says Bob McWade, the bank's spokesman.   Bank of Boston's bid is not the only one stirringcontroversy. Because of the central bank's role in overseeingbank holding companies, Rep. John D. Dingell (D., Mich.), thepowerful chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,recently sent a letter to Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan warningthat the Fleet/KKR bid &quot;raises serious legal and publicpolicy issues&quot; because it risks blurring the separation ofbanking and commerce. KKR, a leveraged buy-out firm, controlsRJR-Nabsico and other industrial companies.   Little is known about the structure of the Fleet/KKRpartnership and what control, if any, a victorious bid wouldgive KKR over a bank. But in his April 11 letter that wasalso sent to FDIC Chairman William Seidman, Mr. Dingell urgedrejection of the proposal. &quot;The Congress is engaged in athorough review of the issues raised by the so-calledbanking-commerce debate,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It would be highlyirregular and indeed, considering what is at stake to thepublic safety net and to the economy, very dangerous todecide the question on an ad hoc basis in a closed biddingprocess.&quot;   The selection of Fleet/KKR, however, would help draw freshcapital and management talent into the banking industry,something Mr. Seidman is known to favor.   Whatever the FDIC decides, the implications will extendfar beyond its immediate goal of finding the lowest-costresolution to a major bank failure.   The selection of BankAmerica, the nation's second-largestbank holding company, would advance the Bush administration'sgoal of promoting nationwide banking by giving the SanFrancisco-based bank a major East Coast foothold.   An FDIC decision in favor of Bank of Boston would triggerrapid consolidation in an economically troubled area wheretoo many banks are competing for too little business, and itwould send a signal to other parts of the country that theFDIC now looks favorably on in-market mergers, a policy usedamong Texas banks in the 1980s with mixed results.</TEXT></DOC>
