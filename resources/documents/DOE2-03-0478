The capital costof the Solar equipment alone can make such an installation appear prohibitivelyexpensive. This paper discusses one Pump Company's efforts to designa pumping system ensuring maximum water pumped for minimum capital investments,combined with low maintenance costs and meeting the needs of developingcountries. The design centered upon the maximisation of power outputfrom the minimum sized Photovoltaic array using a dc-dc Converter witha maximum power point tracker system coupled with Positive-Displacementpumps. The reasons, problems encountered and the local design and manufactureof the control unit are covered. Further problems were encountered andovercome in obtaining suitable Solar and ancilliary equipment in thelocal market. Early investigation into the Solar field made the Companyrealise that it was not enough to just couple the Solar equipment toa pump. Pumps and pumping equipment were especially designed for Solarpumping systems and these are discussed. Having put together and testedthe Solar pumping package, the Company then approached the problem ofmarketing the equipment in a capital expenditure conscious market. Someof the solutions are approached and discussed. The paper is illustratedwith test data, successful installations and other equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
