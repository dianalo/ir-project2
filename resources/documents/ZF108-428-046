This columnwill compare the results of this survey with a report jointly written by 10intellectual property scholars [1] concerning copyright protection for lookand feel and other aspects of user interfaces.andP;  The CHI survey results are,in general, consistent with the scholars' conclusions based on copyrightprinciples [4].andP;  The legal experts see a basis in copyright law for denyingcopyright protection to look and feel, which is what the user interface fieldthinks would be in the field's best interest.andM;The results of the CHI survey can be summarized briefly.andP;  More than 80percent of the 667 respondents to the survey opposed copyright protection forthe look and feel of user interfaces, although they strongly supportedcopyright protection for source and object code.andP;  They regard the kind ofstrong copyright protection being sought in the current look and feellawsuits as likely to have a negative effect on their own work and on theuser interface design community and industry.andP;  They oppose strong copyrightprotection for user interfaces because they think such protection wouldadversely affect the climate of open exchange and discussion of research anddesign innovations that has brought progress to the field.andM;Background on the CHI SurveyandM;To assist the user interface design community in becoming more aware of thelegal issues involved in the current round of look and feel lawsuits, PamelaSamuelson organized and moderated a 90-minute legal debate on copyrightprotection for user interfaces as a plenary session at CHI  89 [2].andP;  Thedebate featured Jack Brown, the chief lawyer for Apple Computer in theApple-Microsoft litigation, and Thomas Hemnes, a former defense lawyer in theLotus case.andP;  They debated the legal perspectives on the pros and cons ofprotecting the look and feel of software user interfaces through copyrightlaw.andP;  Michael Lesk of Bell Communications Research was an industrydiscussant.andM;Brown's argument emphasized the significant amount of creative work that wentinto the design of a user interface and the role of copyright in protectingthose whose intellectual labor had produced a valuable product from those whofound it easier to imitate a creative work than to do something creativethemselves.andP;  Hemnes pointed out that not every valuable intellectual productwas protectable by copyright law.andP;  Moreover, copyright law should and wouldrespect nonprotection of certain aspects of intellectual works would furtherprogress in a field.andM;We realized the CHI legal debate would provide a unique and efficientopportunity to survey a large sample of the user interface field about thelegal issues.andP;  Such a survey should not be distributed until after thelawyers had had their say, so the audience would have been educated about theterms of the legal controversy and each side had presented its view.andP;  As thedebate drew to a close, Samuelson informed the audience about the surveybeing distributed to them, and said although judges would make the finalrulings on the look and feel lawsuits, this was a chance for representativesof the user interface design community to vote on the legal issues, and urgedthem to do so.andP;  Before filing out of the auditorium, 667 members of theaudience filled out the survey.andM;A Profile of Survey RespondentsandM;The survey asked a number of questions about the respondents and their firmsso it would be possible to analyze whether characteristics of the respondentsor their firms might predict their views on the look and feel lawsuits andrelated issues.andP;  For example, respondents were asked to select from a list ofjob functions the one or two descriptions that best fit (1.68 was the averagerate of response by job function).andP;  Table I shows the respondents' profile byjob function for the most frequently indicated categories.andM;Respondents were also asked to identify the one best description of theorganization or company for which they work.andP;  Table II reflects the resultsof this question.andP;  The survey did not ask respondents to identify theorganization or firm for which they worked, but since the respondents made up42 percent of the total conference registration, this information provides areasonable substitute without compromising the identity of particularrespondents.andP;  The 10 organizations with the highest number of attendees atCHI '89 were, in decreasing rank order: IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Apple, MCC (thehost organization in Austin), ATandamp;T, Texas Instruments, Xerox, BellCommunications Research, the University of Michigan, and Carnegie-MellonUniversity.andP;  In addition to look and feel litigants Hewlett-Packard, Apple,and Xerox in positions two, three, and five, there were severalrepresentatives each from Ashton-Tate Lotus, and Microsoft in attendance.andM;None of the factors characterizing the survey respondents were found topredict statistically significant differences in their answers to thequestions concerning the role of copyright and patent in the protection ofvarious aspects of software or concerning predicted effects of strongcopyright protection.andP;  In view of the support the survey gives to theminimalist interpretation of the appropriate reach of copyright law asapplied to software [21, it is worth pointing out that the respondents wereamong the leading designers and researchers in their field, responsible forcreating many of the most commercially valuable user interfaces in thesoftware industry.andP;  They typically worked for commercial firms that rely oncopyright law to protect their software products [4].andM;Survey Findings on Protection of Look and FeelandM;One of the principal findings of the survey was that the user interface fieldthinks the look and feel of user interfaces should not be given protection bycopyright or patent law.andP;  Some 77 percent of the respondents with an opinionfelt that look and feel should not be given protection by either copyright orpatent law, while 82 percent opposed copyright protection for look and feel.andM;Quite a few of the survey respondents explained their reasons for opposinglegal protection for look and feel of user interfaces.andP;  Some said they werenot sure what look and feel meant.andP;  Some were unsure how similar interfacescould be in look and feel before infringement might be found.andP;  Others thoughtlook and feel related largely to functionalities of the interface whichcopyright should not protect.andP;  Still others expressed concern for the effecton the users, as well as the industry, if the pending look and feel lawsuitsestablished strong copyright protection for user interfaces [4].andM;In addition to asking about look and feel, the survey asked for views aboutlegal protection of five other aspects of user interfaces, all of which(either explicitly or implicitly) are at issue in the current round of lookand feel cases.andP;  The survey revealed even stronger opposition to copyrightprotection for commands, user interface functionalities, and screen sequencethan to look and feel protection, as well as strong (but somewhat lessopposition) to such protection for screen layouts.andP;  (See Table III.) Iconswere the aspect of user interfaces for which there was strongest sympathy forprotection, but not even this feature enjoyed majority support amongrespondents.andP;  Strongest opposition was registered as to protection ofcommands and user interface functionalities, with more than 9 of every 10respondents objecting to their protection by copyright.andM;Because many of these features overlap significantly with the kind of lookand feel being sought to be protected in the lawsuits, it is not surprisingthe respondents would view protection of these aspects of interfaces in muchthe same way they viewed protection of look and feel.andM;However, opposition to protection of look and feel was not part of wholesalerejection of intellectual property protection for software, as shown in Table111.andP;  The respondents overwhelmingly supported intellectual property (andmainly for copyright) protection for source and object code.andP;  Fully 93percent of those with an opinion supported intellectual property protection,either through copyright or patent, for source code.andP;  The 85 percent supportfor object code protection was nearly as strong.andM;As a group, the respondents strongly supported copyright protection forsource and object code, but did not support copyright protection forpseudocode or modular design.andP;  Least of all did they support copyrightprotection for algorithms, although nearly 40 percent of the respondentssupported patent protection for algorithms.andM;Predicted Negative Effect from Copyright Protection for Look and FeelandM;Another major finding of the CHI survey was that respondents regarded thekind of strong copyright protection being sought in the look and feellawsuits as likely to have a clear negative effect both on theindustry/community and on their own work.andM;In response to a survey question about the effect such protection would have&quot;on your own work,&quot; the average rating (on a five-point scale ranging from&quot;1&quot; for &quot;significant negative effect&quot; to &quot;5&quot; for &quot;significant positiveeffect&quot;) was 2.049, a clear overall expectation of a negative effect.andP;  But itwas not just a minority of respondents with &quot;significant negative&quot; votes whoswayed the average; 72 percent expected a negative impact on their own work(ratings of &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;) if the current lawsuits established strong copyrightprotection, while only nine percent expected the effect on their work to bepositive (ratings of &quot;4&quot; or &quot;5&quot;).andM;The predicted effect &quot;on the user interface design industry/community&quot; waseven more strongly negative, with an average rating of 1.646 on the samefive-point scale.andP;  Indeed, 86 percent of the respondents expected the kind ofstrong copyright protection for user interfaces being sought in the look andfeel lawsuits to have a negative impact on the industry, while only 10percent viewed the prospect as positive.andP;  Table IV gives the results of therespondents' predictions about the likely effect of strong protection ontheir own work and on the industry.andM;Lest the reader interpret these results as only reflecting the opinion ofworker bees or ivory-tower types, we hasten to point out that 15 percent ofthe respondent population identified themselves as managers, and theirresponses to the prediction questions and the protectability of individualfeatures question did not differ in a statistically significant way from theresponses of the respondent group as a whole.andP;  The average predicted industryeffect among the managers, for example, was 1.74.andP;  The average responses byjob function closest to the manager predictions were those of faculty (1.76),students (1.73) and user interface designers (1.72).andP;  All were still wellunder a 2.0 rating, which itself was a negative rating.andP;  Not a singlecategory of respondents measured by job function predicted even a neutral,let alone a positive, effect on the industry if the look and feel lawsuitsestablished the kind of copyright protection being sought.andM;When we compared the answers respondents gave concerning their predictions ofeffect on their own work with their predictions about the industry effect, wenoted that while there was some shifting in both directions, people who gavedifferent ratings on the two questions were 3.5 times more likely to move ina more negative direction when predicting the industry effect.andP;  Particularlystriking was the finding that 19 percent of respondents who expected to beunaffected in their own work if the current lawsuits established strongcopyright for user interfaces, 69 percent expected a negative effect for thefield.andM;The Extent of Restriction Perceived at PresentandM;The survey also inquired about the extent of restriction the respondentscurrently felt about the use they could make of the latest research anddesign innovations which they saw or learned about at conferences such asCHI.andP;  Respondents were asked to select one of four statements that bestdescribed their views.andM;1.andP;  No restrictions: I can freely use anything I learn about or see,andM;2.andP;  Some restrictions: I can't copy exactly, but I am allowed to reimplementor reverse engineer any interesting designs,andM;3.andP;  Significant restrictions: I can copy only general concepts or ideas atthe research stage, orandM;4.andP;  Total restrictions: Once I see it at CHI, I know I can't copy it in anyuser interface design of my own.andM;Some 31 percent reported feeling &quot;no restrictions&quot; on use of innovations seenat CHI.andP;  just under half of the respondents (49 percent) felt only &quot;somerestriction.&quot; One 1-in-5 respondents reported feeling &quot;significantly&quot; (19percent) or  totally&quot; (1 percent) restricted in their use of designinnovations seen at CHI.andP;  (Here, there were some statistically significantresponses among respondents by type of employer.andP;  Government employees feltleast restricted, with 64 percent assuming no restrictions.andP;  However, eventhose who worked for computer manufacturers felt fewer constraints than onemight have guessed, with 24 percent perceiving no restrictions, and another50 percent reporting some restrictions.)andM;Not surprisingly, the fewer restrictions that people currently felt, the morelikely they were to expect a negative effect on their own work if strongcopyright protection was established by the current lawsuits about userinterface issues.andP;  But even those who already feel significant restrictionspredicted negative consequences if look and feel protection was established,with an average of 2.303 on the five-point scale as to their own work, and1.70 as to the industry/community effect.andP;  The average response of &quot;norestriction&quot; respondents was 1.464 for the industry/community effect.andM;How the Legal Debate Affected the Respondents' ViewsandM;Perhaps the most dramatic finding from the survey was the fact that the morethose in the user interface field learned about what copyright lawyersthought about copyright protection of user interface issues, the more likelythey were to think copyright protection for user interfaces should be weaker,rather than stronger.andM;Attendees of the CHI legal debate came with some familiarity of the legalissues involved in the look and feel cases.andP;  Indeed, 64 percent of therespondents rated themselves as &quot;moderately familiar&quot; with the legal issuesbefore the legal debate, and another 9 percent reported being  very familiar&quot;with the issues.andP;  Given how much press attention the look and feel lawsuitshave received, and given how important this community feels the legal issuesto be to the health of their field, this result in itself is not surprising.andM;What was surprising was how people reacted to copyright protection for userinterfaces after they had heard the legal debate.andP;  Half of the respondentsindicated that attending the debate had caused them to change their opinionon copyright protection.andP;  Ten times as many changed their minds to thinkingthat copyright protection should be weaker than changed to thinking it shouldbe stronger.andM;It was not the case that Jack Brown argued less persuasively than ThomasHemnes, for Peter Lewis of the New York Times reported both sides of thelegal debate to be equally persuasive (May 7, 1989).andP;  Moreover, a number ofrespondents praised Brown's skill in argumentation.andP;  The lawyers, quiteappropriately, presented arguments based on the issues that copyright lawregards as relevant to deciding legal disputes.andM;What then explains the strong shift toward thinking copyright protectionshould be weaker? We believe the CHI audience was not so much persuaded toone legal position or the other, but awakened to the nature of the legaldebate and its implications for how they worked and for the field in whichthey worked.andP;  The comment of one survey respondent expresses well theauthors' interpretation of the outcome of the legal debate: &quot;The argumentsand session made me very nervous because the arguments against strongprotection were so compelling based on my knowledge of the field, but theymay not be anywhere near as obvious to non-practitioners-and the courts aregenerally nonpractitioners.&quot;andM;The respondents felt strongly enough about the predicted harm to theirindustry that 63 percent of those who expressed an opinion wanted SIGCHI totake an official position on the legal issues based on the results of thissurvey.andP;  Many who responded &quot;no&quot; to this question said they did so becausethey thought the entire SIGCHI membership should be polled before SIGCHI tookan official position.andM;Comparing the CHI Survey Results to Law Scholars' ReportandM;In part because of some novel legal questions presented by the softwarecopyright lawsuits, a group of 10 intellectual property scholars met lastFebruary at Arizona State University to try to reach consensus on the properapplication of copyright law to the protection of computer programs.andP;  Amongthe questions they addressed was whether copyright protection was appropriatefor the look and feel of computer program user interfaces.andP;  The confereesagreed it was not, saying that use of terms like look and feel &quot;obscuresrather than assists in the application of copyright principles to softwareinterfaces&quot; [1].andP;  The conferees recognized that software user interfaces maybe highly functional, and to the extent they are, that copyright protectionis not available for them, nor for functionally optimal expressions of them.andO;In addition, the conferees recognized that user interface design may beconstrained by technological considerations that may limit the range ofviable expressions,&quot; which would restrict the scope of copyright protectionavailable to them.andM;The conferees found in traditional principles of copyright law an affirmationof the right to study and take unprotected elements from copyrighted programsand reimplement them in other products [1].andP;  While accepting thatintellectual property protection for computer programs should balance theneeds of innovators and competitors so as to promote the health of industriessuch as that for software, the conferees regarded their aim to be a limitedone of articulating how traditional copyright principles might be applied tocomputer programs, not to offer their judgment about whether the larger goalof intellectual property law can best be served by use of copyright law toprotect computer programs.andM;The conferees, while agreeing with the user interface survey respondents thatindividual commands or even sets of commands should not be protected bycopyright, were not able to reach consensus on whether a less thanfunctionally optimal arrangement of commands (or icons) in a user interfacewould be protectable by copyright.andP;  Some conferees, like many in the CHIsurvey population, thought the benefits that would flow to users fromstandardization of such things as command names and command groupings insoftware user interfaces, as well as functional reasons that might exist forgrouping certain kinds of commands together, made it generally inappropriatefor copyright protection to attach to arrangements of commands.andP;  Otherconferees thought that in view of the protection copyright law hadtraditionally afforded to compilations, the organization of a set of commandsfrom one program, if original, might be protected by copyright from exactduplication in a competing program.andM;The conferees were also in agreement with those in the user interface fieldabout some issues related to the protection of icons-that &quot;adoption of afunctional general purpose metaphor might limit the range of copyrightableexpression&quot; and when &quot;the choice of icons is logically based upon the choiceof an overarching metaphor (such as a desktop) or the icon itself has nofanciful characteristics, application of traditional principles wouldpreclude copyright protection for the particular representation of the icon.&quot;andO;However, the conferees also thought traditional principles of copyright lawmight provide protection for some more fanciful pictorial representation oficons.andP;  The CHI survey respondents, however, did not support copyrightprotection for icons, perhaps because they perceive user interface icons asnot really having a fanciful character.andM;The CHI survey data suggests the user interface field has developed becausepeople in the field come to conferences such as CHI to share their new userinterface design ideas with others.andP;  When attendees see good design ideas andthe research that stands behind them, they feel they can incorporate thesedesigns into new products of their own, blending the ideas they have receivedfrom others with the ideas they have developed themselves.andP;  And they do notconsider themselves thieves, plagiarists, or copyright infringers when theydo so.andP;  Rather, they consider themselves scientists and engineers who areinnovating on top of others' ideas in the kind of evolutionary fashion whichhas exemplified development in this field.andM;This evolutionary development seems to have brought about a considerableamount of innovation, improved designs which have made computers and softwaremore accessible and usable by those with minimal or no technical training,and competition about performance, enhanced features, and price.andP;  If eachsoftware firm had to develop a different style of user interface to complywith copyright law, there is concern that copyright might impede how those inthe user interface field do their work, might harm the health of theindustry, and might make more difficult the achievement of the goal of makingcomputers usable by ordinary people.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;It is often stated, but nonetheless true, that a fundamental purpose of theintellectual property laws is to provide protection for innovations in orderto give incentives for people to be creative, thereby promoting progress invarious fields of endeavor.andP;  From this, it follows that where legalprotection of some kinds of innovations is not needed to promote innovationin a field, no protective legislation is needed.andP;  Thus, it must surely be thecase that where intellectual property protection would have a detrimentaleffect on innovation in a field, it should be withheld, especially in an erawhere the law does not as yet dictate the protection being sought.andM;In the case of user interfaces, the CHI survey clearly demonstrates that asignificant segment of the leading designers and researchers in the userinterface field are overwhelmingly opposed to strong copyright protection foruser interfaces and regard such protection as likely to be harmful to thefield, rather than helpful.andP;  These are the very people whom the copyright lawis supposed to be encouraging to be creative.andP;  Given that copyright law has,as yet, not formed a firm position about protection of various aspects ofuser interfaces discussed in this column-and can be construed to supporteither side in the legal debate-judges in the current round of copyright lookand feel cases should be receptive to considering the effect strongprotection would have on the industry.andM;That the views of the technical community are largely consistent with viewsexpressed by legal scholars [1] as to the application of copyright law tocomputer programs suggests that judges in look and feel cases could find anadequate basis in copyright doctrine to do what the user interface fieldthinks would be in the field's best interest.andP;
