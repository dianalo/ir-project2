it wasbacked by investors led by Citicorp Venture Capital and MitsubishiInternational, and its products include 15&quot; portrait multi-scan monitor, ahigh-resolution VGA controller board, and high-speed PostScript controllercard for use with the Hewlett-Packard LaserJet II and compatible laserprinters - including Acer's LP-76.andM;- o -andM;Prime Computer Inc reports that as part of the confidentialityandM;agreement signed by MAI Basic Four Inc, the Tustin, California company hasagreed not to reduce its current tender offer of $19.50 a share for 75% ofPrime's fully diluted shares outstanding and $21-a-share in notes for theremainder, before Prime's annual meeting on July 26.andM;- o -andM;In the wake of President Gorbachev's euphorically-received visitandM;to West Germany, Siemens AG has won a $750,000 order from the Soviet Ministryfor Universities andamp; Intermediary Technical Schools for 300,000 personalcomputers - to be paid for in Soviet chemicals in a barter set by Britain'sAfri-Arab.andM;- o -andM;In a fine example of the US and the UK being two countries dividedandM;by a common language, while program trading on Wall Street means usingcomputers to do things like compare option prices with the prices of thelatest shares, and once they get sufficiently out of line, buying one enmasse and selling the  other, and automatically buying or dumping stock whenkey indicators hit pre-set levels, in London, a programme trade appears tomean the liquidation of a portfolio - and mercifully, another US shareholderpractice has so far not made it over here, that of the nuisance class actionlawsuit when a company fails to do as well as investors expected: over here,unhappy investors confine themselves to remarks like the one from an MBS Plcshareholder to the Financial Times - &quot;I feel terribly disappointed; I boughtinto the company because it was to be headed by two IBM directors, and Ithought it was a marvellous opportunity; there appears to be a jinx on thecompany and on the board&quot;; now the auction begins for the fairly cash-endowedrump of MBS.andM;- o -andM;Yet another of those nuisance lawsuits seeking class actionandM;status, this time on behalf of people who bought Ashton-Tate Corp sharesbetween February 5, 1988 and June 13, 1989: as is the custom, the lawsuitalleges violations of Federal and State securities laws - in the facts andcircumstances leading to the Torrance, California company warning of likelyreduced turnover and possibility of losses for the June 30 and September 30quarters.andP;  And TeleQuest Inc, San Diego is similarly afflicted, saying thatit has been named as a defendant in a securities lawsuit alleging that itviolated several acts relating to its initial public offering in March 1986:the suit names officers and directors of the company at the time, its legalcounsel, auditors, underwriters and various venture capital firms who hadinvested in the company in its start-up phase.andM;- o -andM;Corollary Inc, Irvine, California and The Santa Cruz OperationandM;Inc, Santa Cruz have finally put a formal seal on their partnership in thedevelopment of multi-processing Unix software based on SCO Xenix System V andSCO Unix System V/386: Corollary has already shipped the first product out ofthe agreement, the multiprocessing version of SCO Xenix that has gone toZenith Data Systems for its Z-1000 series; under the contract, Corollary hasaccess to Santa Cruz kernel source code and adds proprietary multiprocessingtechnology to create the 386/smp symmetrical multiprocessing kernel, and theproduct is distributed by both Corollary and Santa Cruz to Santa Cruzcustomers with the appropriate hardware; it is non-exclusive, but Santa Cruzendorses Corollary's extensions as the first choice multiprocessing Xenix.andM;- o -andM;Motorola Inc says it is to announce new members of 88open in theandM;near future, and rumour has it that they could include a defector from theIntel Corp 80860 camp; the company also says it expects to ship 10,000 Deltasystems worldwide this year.andM;- o -andM;Don't hold your breath...andP;  Lotus Development Corp is due to shipandM;the first copies of 1-2-3 3.0 today; the good news for Lotus is that wordfrom the field is that it runs fine on a standard IBM  Personal AT.andM;- o -andM;Correction: Supertek Computers Inc, Santa Clara, California pointsandM;out that the product referred to in Tokyograms as being marketed in Japan byNippon Steel Corp is its Supertek S-1 machine; it was misstyled intranslation back into English from Japanese (CI No 1,188).andM;- o -andM;Just to prove that personal computing really is a professionandM;dominated by a &quot;bratpack&quot;, a survey by the London WC1 recruitment consultancyGreythorn Ltd has revealed that over 80% of employers ask for staff betweenthe age range of 20 to 30: the reason many employers believe applicants aretoo old at 30 is that they themselves are often under 35 and are worried thatolder employees will not respect the wisdom of youth;
