But his testimony suggeststhe nominee had a greater understanding of the White House'soperational role in helping the Contras than has so far beenacknowledged.   Mr. Fiers, who has pleaded guilty to withholdinginformation from Congress, is cooperating with a grand juryinvestigation into the Iran-Contra affair. His appearancebefore the committee came only after he was given a grant ofimmunity.   In colorful strokes, the Central America chief portrayedan intelligence world of clannish intrigue. And even as hepraised Mr. Gates's intellect, Mr. Fiers described him as analoof figure who was seen as a young man &quot;on the make&quot; andcut out at key junctures by older hands in the rivaloperations divisions. Dominating this portrait is the imageof the late Director William Casey, a fierce supporter of theContras and both Mr. Gates's mentor and a link to the shadow&quot;quarterback&quot; of the White House supply network, Marine Lt.Col. Oliver North.   Documents released yesterday include a previouslyclassified December 1984 memo to Mr. Casey in which Mr. Gatesappears to depart from the customary ethos of the coolintelligence analyst and ardently argues for a strongerpolicy against the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua. Onlymonths before, Congress had imposed a ban on military aid tothe insurgents, and Mr. Fiers held senators captive as hedescribed how Mr. Casey summoned top members of theoperations branch to stage what one later described as adeliberate &quot;charade&quot; to illustrate the line between the CIAand its proxy, Col. North.   &quot;Sometime in the dark of the night, Bill Casey has said,`I'll take Central America, just leave it to me,'&quot; Mr. Fiersrecalled being told by the chief of the operations division,Clair George. &quot;What you saw going on in there was a charade.&quot;   &quot;And I looked at Clair and, these were my words, I said,`Jesus Christ, if that's true, this will be worse thanWatergate if it ever comes out.'&quot;   Mr. Fiers's testimony was a reminder of the politicalbitterness of that period. He confirmed instances whereintelligence collected on the Sandinista regime yielded whathe said was embarrassing information related to opponents ofthe war, including congressional staff. He said he had been&quot;outraged&quot; by what was learned from the data and pressed hissuperiors, including Mr. Casey, to take action. But there isconcern in the committee that the intercepted communicationsmay have been a means to seek to pressure lawmakers opposedto the administration's policy.   Committee Chairman David Boren said a report of the matteris being prepared for the panel, and while including anallusion to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, his commentsindicated the data were collected as a result of U.S. effortsto monitor Sandinista communications. Mr. Fiers denied thatthe eavesdropping targeted Americans, but he cited instanceswhere information emerged related to an equal number of U.S.citizens.   &quot;Those who engaged in the Iran-Contra scandal and thosewho are trying to cover for them are shameless in theirarrogance,&quot; said House Majority Whip David Bonior, whostrongly opposed the war. &quot;The KGB tactics of these hardlinerightwingers and their supporters in Congress have no placein a democracy.&quot;   Mr. Gates is expected to be questioned about how theintelligence was used by the CIA when he was deputy director.But the significance of Mr. Fiers's testimony more generallyis the issue of whether the nominee has been candid in hisown performance before the panel. With solid Republicansupport, Mr. Gates is favored to win confirmation, but thehearing record is nonetheless laced with instances where heis unable to recall events testified to by at least twoformer colleagues.   For example, Mr. Gates has said he had little knowledge ofa 1985 secret finding authorizing the CIA's role infacilitating an early shipment of arms to Iran. But documentsreleased by the panel yesterday show that CIA lawyers hadfound a draft of the authorization in preparing testimony forMr. Casey in 1986, and the general counsel then recallsgiving Mr. Gates a copy at a meeting.   Similarly, Mr. Fiers confirmed he had discussions with Mr.Gates in mid-summer 1986 regarding a proposal to have the CIAabsorb the millions in dollars in planes and suppliesaccumulated by the Contra supply network run from the WhiteHouse. Col. North lobbied Mr. Gates through Adm. JohnPoindexter, then President Reagan's national securityadviser. Though Mr. Fiers said he felt no pressure from thedeputy, he recounted a conversation in which Mr. Gatesquestioned him on the proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
