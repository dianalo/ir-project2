The need may also arise when it is felt that the miningsystems of the future must make a clean break with those of the past;in other words, systems of the future must be revolutionary rather thanevolutionary. Several approaches have been proposed and investigatedto resolve these problems. Clearly, problems such as productivity, healthand safety and resource recovery cannot be addressed independently butmust be a part of an overall sequential assessment of exploration, development,and extraction aspects as well as individual auxiliary mine operationsevaluation including mine ventilation, power, mine drainage, final mineclosure, etc. Alternatives to existing systems should include rapid developmentprocedures, truly continuous mining methods and haulage systems, moreeffective ventilation systems, and rapid reserve isolation-techniques.There must also be concurrent development of improved techniques forthe prediction of the performance of these mining systems on deploymentin a general or universal manner. The objective of this paper is to addressthis area of development of systems analysis techniques.</TEXT></DOC>
