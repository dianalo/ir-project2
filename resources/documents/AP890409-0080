The 20-page publication has been dubbed a newspaper by itspublisher, Whittle Communications LP, although it resembles some ofthe magazines often stuffed in the Sunday newspaper.   In View is to appear five times during the academic year, and isbeing distributed free through school officials at more than 600campuses at sites such as sorority houses and women's dorms andathletic facilities.   Whittle, based in Knoxville, Tenn., said it expects In View willattract about 2 million readers.   Maybelline Co., the cosmetics maker, is the sole advertiser inthe first two issues, placing multiple ads. Financial arrangementswere not disclosed.   ``It's tough to reach college women with conventionaladvertising,'' said Lewis Nolan, a spokesman for Memphis,Tenn.-based Maybelline.   ``They don't settle into the routine other poeople have ofwatching TV at regular times of the day or reading the morningnewspaper or keeping up a subscription to a magazine,'' he said.   But will they find time to read In View?   Whittle, which has built itself into a $150 million-a-yearbusiness by developing media vehicles that appeal tonarrowly-defined audiences such as mothers waiting in the doctor'soffice or animal owners at the veterinarian, spent more than a yearinterviewing college women and says the research has given it theinsight needs to succeed where others have failed.   ``We found there is a need for information that college womendon't get from traditional magazines,'' said Jim Hilmer, a Whittledivision manager who oversaw development of In View. ``They wantedstraight talk on issues that they have trouble dealing with.''   In the inaugural issue, In View's story, ``Am I My Sister'sKeeper,'' discusses how to decide what to do when a roommate showssigns of having a drug problem, eating disorder or severedepression. Others stories discussed how all-nighters affect yourhealth and what opportunities await psychology majors.   Editor Mara Covell said what readers won't get are ``how-tostories'' or tips on quick fixes for their lives or appearances.``We are not talking down to them,'' she said.   The college market has proven a tricky one for some majorpublishers.   Newsweek and McGraw-Hill Co. each discontinued magazines aimedspecifically at college students last year. Whittle itself droppedits flagship Campus Voice magazine last year and now publishessponored posters under the Campus Voice name at colleges.   Earlier this year, the California-based Alan WestonCommunications Inc. discontinued its three college magazines _College Woman, Moving Up and Ampersand's Entertainment Guide.Ampersand had been published since 1977 and was being maileddirectly with the other two magazines, one aimed at women and theother at men, to a total of 1.2 million students.   Larry Smuckler, president of Alan Weston, said his company gaveup on those magazines because of the volatility of ad spendingaimed at college students.   He said some advertisers would spend a lot of money one yearreaching the college market, but abruptly change direction and trysomething else the next.   ``How can one operate a business on the basis of those kind ofdecisions,'' he said.   Smuckler's company is now creating publications under contractfor companies and produces a sponsored movie trailer for theaters.   There have been some new efforts to reach the college market.   American Express Co., for instance, recently developed alifestyle magazine that will be sent four times a year tocardholders who are college students.   Dow Jones andamp; Co. Inc., publisher of the Wall Street Journal, senta 44-page magazine it described as the college edition of itsNational Business Employment Weekly to more than 1,000 schools inFebruary. The sole sponsor was American Honda Motor Co. Inc.   Follett College Stores Inc. gave away a million copies of itsnew publication, Great Opportunities, through its 280 collegebookstores in January.   The 20-page publication, which is to be published each Augustand January, contained 19 pages of promotional offers fromadvertisers and a single page of tips on resumes and job interviews.   Jim Baumann, vice president of advertising at Follett inElmhurst, Ill., said students are not very interested in gettingnews-oriented publications tailored for them. ``Given their choiceor reading Newsweek or the campus Newsweek, they would choose thereal thing,'' he said.   But he said they don't mind being singled out for specialtreatment when it comes to offering bargains.</TEXT></DOC>
