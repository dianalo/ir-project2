(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. George Deukmejian signedlegislation today restricting the sale and possession of assaultweapons in California, a first-in-the-nation law stemming from aschoolyard massacre.   The two bills signed by the Republican governor virtually banthe sale of more than 50 specified semiautomatic assault rifles,pistols and shotguns after Jan. 1 and sharply restrict theirpossession.   Deukmejian said at the signing ceremony that law enforcementofficers ``need all the help we can give.''   One gun-owners group immediately attacked the governor's action,vowing to mount a recall drive against him and Assemblyman MikeRoos, author of one of the bills. ``Hundreds and thousands of gunowners throughout this state have called or written to GeorgeDeukmejian. Their message has been ignored,'' said Larry Kempton ofVictorville, president of the California Gun Rights Committee.   Attempts to restrict such weapons had been blocked repeatedly bythe gun lobby, led by the National Rifle Association, until ashooting rampage at a Stockton school four months ago left fivechildren and the gunman dead.   The slayings by a deranged drifter carrying a semiautomaticAK-47 rifle rallied the public support needed to push the measurethrough.   Under the legislation, people who owned the listed weaponsbefore June 1 may keep them by obtaining permits. Otherwise, theguns can be possessed only with a special-needs permit, such asthose obtained by movie studios for machine guns.   Possession would be a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year injail and a $1,000 fine, or a felony, carrying up to three years inprison. The bills would also increase the penalties for crimes inwhich assault weapons are used.   The bills would allow the attorney general to go into court toadd similar guns to the list.</TEXT></DOC>
