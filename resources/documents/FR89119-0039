McKenzie</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Summary</ITAG>Pursuant to the December 13, 1988 Recommended Decision and Order of theAdministrative Law Judge, which Decision and Order is attached hereto andaffirmed in principle part by me, John W. McKenzie, individually and doingbusiness as TEKSYS, Inc., with addresses of 6215 Raintree Court, Dallas,Texas 75240 and c/o East West Research and Design, 111/3 Nagombo Road,Peliyagoda, Sri Lanka, is, and the Respondents are collectively, deniedfor a period of five years from the date hereof all privileges of participatingin any transaction involving commodities or technical data exported fromthe United States in whole or in part, or to be exported, or that are otherwisesubject to the regulations (14 CFR Parts 768-700); provided, however, thatcommencing one year from the date hereof the denial period is suspendedfor the balance of the five year term, and shall be terminated at the endof such term, provided that the Respondents, or either of them, have committedno further violations of the Act, the Regulations, or the final Order enteredin this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background and Discussion</ITAG>The ALJ originally made his Recommended Decision and Order in this caseon October 14, 1988. The matter was Remanded to the ALJ on November 15,1988 in order that he might answer two questions posed by the Remand. Onequestion concerned whether or not Respondents involved with the same violationsshould be treated equally with respect to sanctions absent compelling reasonsto do otherwise. The other question sought the ALJ's opinion on certain``boiler plate'' language generally found in denial orders. The ALJ's answersto those questions are found in his attached Recommended Decision and Order.The ALJ's recommended sanction of the Respondents in this case remainsunchanged from that in his October 14, 1988 Recommended Decision and Order.Although I am not convinced by the ALJ's arguments concerning the reasonfor the different sanctions in the two related cases, the evidence is notof such a nature that I can say as a matter of law the ALJ was in errorin imposing the sanction that he has recommended. For that reason, I affirmthe ALJ's Recommended Decision and Order. In doing so, I should also notethat the ALJ again repeats his claim that Departmental counsel intentionallyfiled separate charging letters in related cases so as to inflate, presumablyfor personal performance reasons, the number of cases prosecuted by theDepartment. It is axiomatic that each individual charged in a particularmatter, whether or not he or she acts in concert with another, representsa separate prosecution which must be proved in accordance with the rulesof evidence. The change may or may not be contained in a joint chargingletter. If it is contained in a joint charging letter, the Respondent maymove for a proceeding separate from that of the other Respondents, subjectto a decision on that motion by the ALJ. Likewise, a Respondent might moveto consolidate separate cases into one proceeding. Finally, it is withinthe prerogative of the Administrative Law Judge to consolidate relatedcases on his own order, subject to the review of the Under Secretary, shouldthe facts warrant such a consolidation order. It is certainly wihin theprerogative of the ALJ to inquire of the Department with respect to eachnew charging letter whether or not it is related to another, separatelyfiled charging letter. The ALJ's allegation is uncalled for; it relatesmore to his disagreement with applicable statute of limitations than itdoes to the cases involved.As to the question on the clarity of one clause versus a similar one, thequestion is moot. I have previously decided the issue. Also, I disagreewith the ALJ's characterization of Departmental counsel's behavior withrespect to the issue.<ITAG tagnum="84">Order</ITAG>On December 13, 1988, the ALJ entered his Recommended Decision and Orderin the captioned matter. That Decision and Order, a copy of which is attachedhereto and made a part hereof, has been referred to me for final action.I hereby affirm the Recommended Decision and Order of the ALJ, subjectonly to my disassociation with this remarks concerning multiple chargingletters by Departmental counsel and to modification of Paragraph III, pp13 and 14, to which I add the following paragraph: ``Such denial of exportprivileges shall extend only to those commodites and technical data whichare subject to the Act and Regulations.''This constitutes final agency action in this matter.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Paul Freedenberg,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Under Secretary for Export Administration.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Default Decision And Order On Remand</ITAG>Preliminary Statement<ITAG tagnum="21">Appearance for Respondent: John W.

McKenzie, individually and doing business as Teksys, Inc. (Respondents),charging Respondents with violating the Export Administration Act of 1979,as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 2401-2420, as amended, the Act) and andSection;andSection;387.5 and 387.6 of the Export Administration Regulations (the Regulations).\1\<NOTE/> An Order dated May 18, 1988, extended the time in which toanswer the charging letter to July 15, 1988. The Respondents failed toanswer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Act was reauthorized and amended by the Export AdministrationAmendments Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-64, 99 Stat. 120 (July 12, 1985), andamended by the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100-418,102 Stat. 1107 (Aug. 23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28">The Regulations, formerly codified at 15 CFR Parts 368-399, were redesignatedas 15 CFR Parts 768-799, effective October 1, 1988 (53 FR 37751, September28, 1988).</ITAG>Because of the failure to answer, this Office issued an Order, dated August4, 1988, ruling Respondents in default and directing Agency Counsel tofile an evidentiary submission by September 3, 1988. Pursuant to andSection;388.8 of the Regulations, which provides:<ITAG tagnum="71">DEFAULT (a) General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If a timely answer is not filed, the department shall file with theAdministrative Law Judge a proposed Order together with the supportingevidence for the allegations in the charging letter. The AdministrativeLaw Judge may require further submissions and shall issue any Order hedeems justified by the evidence of record, any Order so issued shall havethe same force and effect as an Order issued following the dispositionof contested charges.</ITAG>Agency Counsel filed the Motion for Default Judgment on September 2, 1988.The Agency also submitted documentary evidence to support allegations madein the charging letter. A copy of the above mentioned Motion for DefaultJudgment was also sent to the Respondents on September 2, 1988 to whichthere has been no response. The Administrative Law Judge's Decision wasissued on October 14, 1988. On November 15, 1988 the proceeding was remandedto this Office soliciting responses to two questions addressed hereafter.Facts and DiscussionThe charging letter issued on April 27, 1988 alleged that the Respondentsviolated andSection;andSection; 387.5 and 387.6 of the Regulations. Specifically,Agency submits that, on or about April 2, 1983, April 23, 1983, April 30,1983, and May 14, 1983, Respondents exported or caused to be exported,from the United States to the Netherlands \2\<NOTE/> U.S.-origin electronic communication equipment (General Electrichand held two-way radios) with knowledge that those goods were intendedto be, and in fact were, reexported to Libya. Since Respondents had failedto obtain from the Agency the validated export license required by andSection;372.1(b) of the Regulations for each of these exports to Libya, the Agencyasserts that Respondents committed five violations of andSection; 387.6 ofthe Regulations.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ There was one shipment made on each of the above-mentioneddates, two shipments on April 23, 1983.The Agency also submits that, in connection with the shipments made onor about April 2, 1983 and April 30, 1983, and the two shipments made onor about April 23, 1983, Respondents made false representations of materialfact by stating on the Shipper's Export Declaration (SED), accompanyingeach of the four shipments that the commodities being shipped were intendedfor ultimate destination in the Netherlands when Respondents knew thatthe commodities were intended for ultimate destination in Libya. The Agencyalleges that in so doing, Respondents committed four violations of andSection;387.5 of the Regulations.The Respondents have filed no response to the charging letter, nor haveany of the facts alleged in the charging letter been contested by the Respondentsor anyone else employed by Teksys, Inc. The Agency submitted documentaryevidence showing that Counsel for Respondent Teksys, Inc. admitted thatthe company had made the five shipments of U.S.-origin electronics communicationsequipment to Libya through the Netherlands (Agency Exh. 1).\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ This admission was made in a memorandum submitted to theUnited States Attorney, who later declined criminal prosecution in thismatter.The Agency submitted several Teksys, Inc. employee statements, includingone made by Respondent McKenzie, indicating that Teksys, Inc. had a businessrelationship with a Libyan company in the late 1970's through the early1980's (Agency Exh. 2-5). Other documentary evidence demonstrated thatin late 1982, Respondent Teksys, Inc. received several orders for U.S.-originelectronic communication equipment from this company (Agency Exh. 6). Inaccordance with a September 29, 1982 letter from the Libyan company toRespondent Teksys, Inc., testing of electronic communication equipmentwas to take place at Teksys, Ltd. (a Teksys, Inc. subsidiary) in Dallas,Texas or in Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Agency Exh. 7). The employee statementsindicate that the acceptance testing took place in Amsterdam, because theLibyans who were to perform this acceptance testing were unable to travelto Texas.Other evidence showed that Respondent Teksys, Inc. filled orders receivedfrom the Libyan company in five separate shipments of U.S.-origin electroniccommunication equipment to its foreign subsidiary in Amsterdam (AgencyExh. 8-12). This evidence clearly demonstrates Respondent Teksys, Inc.knew, based on the purchase orders received, that the U.S.-origin electroniccommunication equipment was intended for ultimate destination to the companyin Libya.Section 372.1(b) of the Regulations requires a validated export licensefor the export of this equipment to Libya. The equipment in question hadbeen subject only to G-Dest controls until the presidential order restrictingtrade with Libya. Respondent McKenzie asserts that he was not informedof that change. He should have been. The absence of any such license foreach of the five shipments constitutes five violations of andSection; 387.6of the Regulations.The evidence further demonstrates that separate SED's were filed with theU.S. Customs Service for the shipments made on or about April 2, 1983 andApril 30, 1983 and for two shipments made on or about April 23, 1983. Thesedocuments reflect that ultimate destination of these shipments was theNetherlands. The shipments were made to Amsterdam, and then the equipmentwas shipped to the company in Libya (Agency Exh. 1, 13). By making falsestatements of a material fact in connection with the submission of theseexport control documents to officials of a United States Agency, Respondentscommitted four violations of andSection; 387.5 of the Regulations.ConclusionThe evidence submitted by Agency Counsel supports the charges made by theAgency in the April 27, 1988 charging letter. The Respondents exportedor caused to be exported U.S.-origin electronic communication equipmentwith knowledge that those goods were intended to be reexported to Libyawithout the required authorization from the U.S. Department of Commerce.Further, Respondents made false representations of material fact on theShipper's Export Declarations regarding the ultimate destination of thegoods.The pattern of conduct demonstrated by the violations shows an intent toviolate United States export laws and regulations. The goods unlawfullyexported to Libya by the Respondents were controlled for foreign policypurposes. I find that an Order denying export privileges for five yearsis warranted and is reasonably necessary to protect the public interest,and to achieve effective enforcement of the Export Administration Act andthe Regulations. However, I also recognize that Respondent, who presentsthe classic media image of a high-flying wheeling-dealing Texan, has beenessentially bankrupted by his failure to know and follow the bureaucraticrules that are so anathema to his ilk.Remand Questions and ResponsesOn November 15, 1988 this proceeding was remanded to this office solicitingresponses to two questions which are addressed thereafter.<ITAG tagnum="21">1. The violations at issue in the captioned matter are the same aswere at issue in <T3>In re Richard C. Carter </T3>(Docket No. 8106-01, Oct. 6, 1988). Inthat case the ALJ approved a consent agreement imposing a three year denialperiod on the Respondent. What factors support treating the instant Respondentin a substantially different manner? Should not those charged with thesame violations be treated equally absent compelling reasons to do otherwise?</ITAG>Review of the files in this proceeding and (<T3>Carter, </T3>Docket No. 8106-01 (53 FR 43911, October 31, 1988)) reflectsthat these matters were initiated as separate cases. Initially this Officeattempted to track them concurrently, however, with the issuance of thepro forma consent decision in <T3>Carter, </T3>any relationship between the proceedings was removed.The handling of these cases supports the comment previously made to theeffect that Agency Counsel seek to inflate the number of a few stale cases.By so doing, the numbers are inflated, however, the connection betweenthe cases is not reflected in the automated docket system. Here the attemptedconnection between these two matters was lost when one was settled. Itis also appropriate to observe that in approving consent agreements therehas been little by way of substantive or evidentiary materials submittedwhich would provide the factual basis for determining the relationshipof the various parties or the degree of their comparative derelictionsin different proceedings. An effort is now being made to provide some moresubstantive submissions in consent cases and to jointly track related cases.<T3>See Behar, </T3>Docket No. 8501-01 (53 FR 48666, December 2, 1988).However, as may be noted from the footnote on the first page of the Agencysubmission for default here, the hostility of Agency Counsel to even theattempt to connect the related cases is manifest. Nor did Agency Counselindicate that there should have been parallel consideration respectingpenalties. Had the submission to this Trier of the facts contained therepresentations and supporting materials, made for the first time on pages3 and 4 of the Initial Submission to the Under Secretary, that tardilysubmitted request could have been considered.The approval in <T3>Carter </T3>was based upon an agreed settlement, the assessment ofthe penalty here was based upon independent consideration of a factualrecord, including the U.S. Attorney's decision not to proceed criminally.The materials set forth in the record, including the fifteen exhibits,fully support the disposition reached here. While it is a truism that thosecharged with identical violations should be treated equally, here therewere reasons for treating the two Respondents differently. Even AgencyCounsel suggested that a three year denial was appropriate for RespondentCarter and a five year denial was appropriate for Respondent McKenzie.\4\<NOTE/> Evaluation of the presentation made in this case led to thejudgment that a substantial part of the denial period should be suspended.The Damocles Sword approach is particularly well suited in these casesto encourage compliance, which is the principle purpose of these proceedings.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Hopefully, the fact of a default or a request for hearingwould not be the basis for increasing the suggested penalty.Review of the file also indicates that while Carter was specifically namedand the record appears to reflect that he and the company manager werethe individuals who executed the documents in the various export transactionscharged, Respondent McKenzie was not specifically identified with the transactions.The record rather indicates that it was his status as the chief executiveof the company which established his responsibility. The explanation inAgency Exh. 1 and the other documents supports the conclusion that theequipment was not highly technical or sophisticated, there was a changein export control policy which the company and Respondent McKenzie failedto ascertain and implement, as they should have done, and that the exportcontrols violated were of a foreign policy rather than a national securitynature.This Tribunal is statutorily charged with exercising its independent judgmentin these cases. Agency Counsel's arguments and conclusions, to the extentthey are supported by record evidence, deserve consideration.\5\<NOTE/> Mere argument or assertion is not such a sufficient basis.The disposition affirmed here is supported by the record.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Agency Counsel's advice to the effect that the AdministrativeLaw Judges actions should be set aside or modified raises substantial question.In <T3>Dart v. U.S., </T3>848 F.2d 217 (DC Cir. 1988) the Court of Appealssaid:<ITAG tagnum="28">It is clear that the common usage of the word ``modify'' does notdescribe the Secretary's action in this case. The dictionary's first meaningof ``modify'' is: ``to make more temperate and less extreme.'' </ITAG><T3>Webster's Third New International Dictionary </T3>1452 (Merriam-Webstered. 1981.). At most, the word means ``to make a basic or important changein.'' <T3>Id. </T3>(fourth definition).<ITAG tagnum="21">2. Is there any legal reason why the final sentence of paragraph IIIof the proposed Decision and Order should not read as follows: ``Such denialof export privileges shall extend to <T3>commodities and technical data </T3>which are subject to the act andregulations?</ITAG>No! Over a period of eight months in 1987 representatives of this officemet with representatives of the Under Secretary (then the Assistant Secretary)to respond to concerns of the Under Secretary's staff respecting the formlanguage of the Orders. The precise language now complained of was suggestedby the Under Secretary's representative. As of November 3, 1987 a standardstyle and content was implemented. Recently, on September 23, 1988, theGeneral Counsel's office tardily expressed its views, and on October 26,1988, those comments, with this office's edits, were forwarded to the UnderSecretary's office. That transmittal gave notice of the revision beingimplemented and which is used here. In it, the sentence containing thecontested language is deleted because it is redundant. There has been noresponse. The denial and civil penalty language is of substantial significanceto individuals and the bar. The form and content of such orders could beimproved through participation by the public and particularly the bar.Public notice and comment followed by the codification in the regulationsis appropriate.OrderI.
