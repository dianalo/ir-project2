Carlos Duque said in a speech Sunday that the reported aid was``brazen intervention'' in the campaign that ends with nationwideelections on May 7. He said he thought the actual amount of aid wasmuch higher than $10 million.   Duque is backed by de facto ruler Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega,with whom the U.S. government has long been at odds.   The May 1 issue of U.S. News and World Report said Bush inFebruary signed the secret intelligence directive to give $10million to the Panamanian opposition.   The magazine quotes unnamed sources as saying Bush personallylobbied the plan through the congressional intelligence committeesand won approval for the CIA to provide more than $10 million inaid. It says the money was to be used for printing, advertising,transportation and communications for candidates opposing Noriega.   Reagan set a similar program in motion a year ago, the magazinesaid. The New York Times reported today that the Reaganadministration plan was intended to dislodge Noriega withoutviolence. Failing that, the plan called for a coup by aU.S.-supported rebel force led by Col. Eduardo Herrara, aPanamanian exile in Miami, the Times said, quoting governmentofficials.   The plan, which was created by executive branch agencies, wasrejected by the Senate Intelligence Committee, apparently becauseof the possibility that Noriega might be assassinated, the Timessaid. A presidential order bars American participation inassassinations.   Asked about the U.S. News report Saturday, White Housespokeswoman Alixe Glen said, ``I can't comment on intelligencematters.''   She added that the U.S. official position remains opposed toNoreiga but the government does not back any candidates there.   ``Our position remains the same. We want to return democracy tothe Panamanian people.'' She added, however, ``It's the Panamanianpeople that vote.''   On May 7, Panamanians will chose a new president, two vicepresidents, 67 legislators and 510 local representatives.   The opposition Democratic Alliance Coalition has emerged as thestrongest competition for the government-backed National LiberationCoalition in the upcoming election.   It is backing Guillermo Endara, who has called the election aplebiscite on Noriega's de facto rule.   Last spring, the United States imposed economic sanctionsagainst Panama in an attempt to force out the powerful leader ofthe Defense Forces.   The sanctions were imposed after Noriega was indicted by twofederal grand juries in Florida on drug trafficking charges and heorchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle. Delvallehad tried to fire Noriega after the indictment.   Noriega denies the U.S. criminal charges.   Bush this month extended the sanctions, which include sharprestrictions on U.S. companies that do business in Panama, a holdon assets of the Panamanian government in the United States and aprohibition on tax payments by U.S. organizations to Panama.   U.S. officials have raised the possibility that the sanctionscould be eased if the May 7 elections are deemed to be fair. Butthe officials have expressed pessimism that that will be the case.   During his Sunday campaign speech in Chorrera, 25 miles west ofPanama City, Duque told thousands of supporters that the oppositionplans to create violence and chaos during the elections.</TEXT></DOC>
