For excitedstates with small principal quantum numbers the results are in accordwith values obtained from C/sub 6/-C/sub 8/-C/sub 12/ potentials calculatedsemiempirically. For intermediate principal quantum numbers the experimentsshow that the elastic scattering of the valence electron at the noblegas atom must be considered additionally. The experimental shift ratesof P/sub 1/2/ states are found to be larger than of P/sub 3/2/ states.Furthermore, the line shifts of the one- and two-photon transitions concerningthe 6P/sub 1/2/, 6P/sub 3/2/, 9P/sub 1/2/, 9P/sub 3/2/, 7S/sub 1/2/ statesshow that the contribution of the lower level of the transition mustbe considered too.</TEXT></DOC>
