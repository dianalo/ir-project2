The biotechnology concern noted that none of the altered microbes, designed to protect crops from frost damage, were detected outside the test area. It also said the microbes found on soil at the test site had &quot;died to undetectable levels.&quot;    Advanced Genetic said it was &quot;very pleased&quot; the initial results of the open-air test successfully confirmed its earlier laboratory tests. The test was designed in part to prove that the microbes could survive in a natural environment. Because it doesn't freeze in California this time of year, company officials plan to expose the treated plants to freezing conditions in a laboratory later.    As previously reported, Advanced Genetic had to overcome resistance from residents near the strawberry field 30 miles east of San Francisco, a legal challenge, and vandalism of the test site before the company carried out the long-delayed test on April 24. Opponents cited concerns that the microbes could prove to be dangerous and would have no natural enemies that would prevent them from spreading.    The company said it planned a second application late yesterday of the bacteria, called Frostban. </TEXT></DOC>
