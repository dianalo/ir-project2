JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Ships and airplanes searched theNorth Atlantic for survivors Saturday near the blazing remains of aGreek tanker that broke in two, leaving one crewman known dead and28 people missing.   But as darkness fell, the U.S. Coast Guard said it wassuspending search operations and there was no plan to resume themSunday.   Petty Officer Brad Terrill of the U.S. Coast Guard's AtlanticOperations said, ``Search conditions were excellent all day withgood to excellent visibility, low seas and mild winds. But nothinghas been spotted since the one body was recovered Friday evening.''   A Dutch cargo ship recovered the body of Polish seaman AndrejSzukalski, 41, from the oil-slicked sea near the 500-foot AthenianVenture around 6.p.m. Friday.   ``He was in a lifejacket but not in a liferaft,'' said Terrillin a telephone interview from New York. Terrill said an earlierreport that the ship's log was found with the body was incorrect,and the document was the victim's passport.   U.S. Coast Guard officials said there were 29 people aboard thetanker, including the wives of five crewmen, and it was believedthat all of the victims were Polish nationals.   Terrill said the stern section of the 18,000-ton tanker, haulinggasoline and bunker fuel from Amsterdam to New York, was stillburning and ``probably will be burning for quite a bit of time.''The bow portion sank Friday.   The crippled tanker was about 800 miles east of New York whenthe Canadian research ship Hudson spotted it ablaze after midnight370 miles southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland.   The Hudson reported that one of the tanker's lifeboats had beenlaunched and a Canadian coast guard spokesman said three life raftsand a lifeboat were missing from the tanker, leading to hope theremight be survivors.   But Lt. Cmdr. Kent Fisher of the U.S. Coast Guard said thelifeboats may have been missing because they burned and there waslittle hope of finding any survivors.   Although the Coast Guard initially said the tanker had sent nodistress signals, Terrill said Saturday: ``There was a very briefSOS (Thursday) evening which was heard up and down the East Coast.It was just one brief mayday and that's all anyone heard.''   Terrill said a Canadian airplane and the Hudson were joined bytwo U.S. Coast Guard C-130 aircraft and a cutter in the search forsurvivors and they were working in much better weather lateSaturday that they had earlier.   Early Saturday, the tanker's fiery hulk was being buffeted inrain squalls and winds exceeding 55 mph that whipped up 5-footswells. But later in the day, Terrill said, there were calm androlling seas three to five feet high, with good visibility and highovercast.   There was no indication what caused the fire.   Patron Marine of Athens, owners of the Cypriot-registeredtanker, notified the Coast Guard that there had been 29 peopleaboard the Athenian Venture _ including 24 crewmen and the wives offive of them.   About one-sixth of the ship _ the bow _ broke off and sank, withfive-sixths of the rear of the ship still burning intensely,Terrill said.   Capt. Loran Strum of the Hudson said the tanker was burningfiercely and had broken in two by the time his ship approached.   ``We could see fire through the house windows so she's allburned out in the bridge sector,'' Strum said in a ship-to-shoreradio interview. ``I think I could quite safely say it would beimpossible for anyone to be alive aboard.''   Strum, a 37-year veteran of the sea, said a column of smoke fromthe tanker's stern could be seen for 30 miles.</TEXT></DOC>
