The officers were snared in an undercover sting run by the FBIand the Police Department's internal affairs division, U.S.Attorney Anton Valukas said Thursday.   ``The investigation, which merged the investigative resources ofthe Chicago Police Department and the FBI, should serve as anotherreminder that corruption of law enforcement agents simply will notbe tolerated,'' Valukas said.   In exchange for bribes, the police _ 10 patrol officers and twosergeants _ allegedly warned the pushers and gamblers about plannedraids, and selectively enforced the law against their competitorsin those illegal trades, the indictment charges.   The officers are charged with racketeering and racketeeringconspiracy, as are 21 alleged narcotics dealers and gamblers whopaid bribes totaling more than $160,000, Valukas said.   Valukas said the FBI set up the sting using an apartmentequipped with hidden cameras and microphones after two policeofficers told federal authorities they had been offered bribes.   Police Officer Cynthia White posed as a corrupt patrolwoman andaccepted payoffs from January 1986 to September 1987, anddistributed the money to the accused officers, Valukas said.   ``When the opportunity to infiltrate a payoff conspiracydeveloped, Officer White stepped forward. For 19 months, she playedthe demanding and dangerous undercover role of a cop who wasreceiving and distributing payoff money,'' Valukas said.   Cmdr. Mardren Johnson, who is in charge of the South Sidedistrict in which the indicted police worked, also workedundercover for the FBI, Valukas said.   The 12 officers were reassigned to administrative chores whilethe charges are pending, said department spokeswoman Tina Vicini.   If convicted, the officers each face a maximum of 40 years inprison and a $500,000 fine.</TEXT></DOC>
