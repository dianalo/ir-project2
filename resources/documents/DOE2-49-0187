On account of the pore size distribution of CMSN2, the diffusioncoefficient of oxygen is more than eight times those of nitrogen andargon so that air separation occurs by adsorption kinetics. Experimentalresults for the individual steps and cyclic operation of the PSA processare presented and compared with the predictions of an isothermal plug-flowmodel. Adsorption rate is represented by a linear driving force equation.If the diffusion coefficients are adapted separately to every step, agood agreement is observed between the model calculations and experimentalresults.</TEXT></DOC>
