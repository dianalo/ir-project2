The Separaex membrane unit atanother Major gas producer's well in South Texas demonstrates the unattendedoperability of membrane systems. Production costs associated with theremote membrane system are lower than the previous gas blending optionutilized. Membrane system design, process selection criteria and economics,and operation and discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
