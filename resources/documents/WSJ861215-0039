O'BoyleStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/15/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP </IN><DATELINE> HAMBURG, West Germany  </DATELINE><TEXT>    Samuel Simonsson has justreturned from a trip to Japan. In a few minutes he will meetwith customers from Italy. In a few hours he is leaving forMoscow.   Mr. Simonsson makes lasers, and these days demand is about as hot as the light beam itself. Rofin-Sinar Laser G.m.b.H., which built its first laser only four years ago, already is the world's No. 3 producer of industrial lasers. It has sold more than 300 custom-built machines to customers in 23 countries; sales have advanced 70% annually for several years.    Such success wouldn't have seemed probable a few years ago for any start-up venture in West Germany, much less one in the vanguard of high technology. From government ministries to corporate boardrooms, Germans sensed they were falling behind the U.S. and Japan in the global race for technological leadership.    But as Rofin-Sinar's sudden rise suggests, that technology gap may be closing. In such highly advanced technologies as lasers, high-energy and nuclear physics and pharmaceutical research, Germany now matches or surpasses Japan and the U.S., technology experts say.    &quot;Five or six years ago, the Germans were buying other people's lasers. Now they're the world's leaders,&quot; says David Belforte, an industry consultant in Sturbridge, Mass. &quot;The technology they have introduced is very impressive.&quot; Germany's funding of laser research, he adds, &quot;far exceeds the U.S. and perhaps even Japan and the U.S. combined.&quot;    Of course, German technology is woefully inadequate in several fields, most notably microelectronics and computers. Moreover, the success of many joint European projects, which aim in particular to shore up the continent's low standing in electronics, won't be known for years.    Still, German scientists won the Nobel Prize for physics this year and last, Germany's first back-to-back selection in the category since 1919. Total government and private research spending has risen nearly 20% in the past three years, to the equivalent of $27.3 billion, the highest proportion of research spending to gross national product of any nation.    And in its latest &quot;World Competitiveness Report,&quot; the European Management Forum, a Swiss research firm, rates West German industry's technological effort as second in the world -- behind Japan but ahead of the U.S., which dropped to fifth place from second in this year's rankings.    &quot;There's a wide range of German industry that is competitive technologically,&quot; says Thomas Rauschenbach, who wrote the study.    In the case of lasers, German industry is not only competitive but is widely believed to be leading the pack. That leadership in part reflects the government's own recognition that lasers are an important future technology that builds on German strengths in fields such as optics, precision equipment and physics, and should therefore be nurtured.    As much as 20% of Rofin-Sinar's research budget is federally funded. Of the 72 projects under Western Europe's Eureka research-support umbrella, the second largest is the so-called Eurolaser program. About 40% of its $205 million support comes from the Bonn government.    While President Reagan envisions bold uses for the laser in his proposed space-based missile-defense system, the Germans think nonmilitary applications have the most potential. Though world-wide sales of all types of lasers will barely exceed $500 million this year, the laser already is an essential tool.    German companies are heavily involved. The electronics giant Siemens AG supplies more than one-third of the world's supermarket checkout scanners. Tiny Lambda Physik G.m.b.H. of Goettingen makes 70% of the world's excimer lasers, used to perform delicate surgery. And in factory automation, powerful Rofin-Sinar lasers are used to cut, weld and anneal many materials, replacing traditional processes.    &quot;Lasers won't replace spot welding,&quot; predicts Mr. Simonsson, Rofin-Sinar's boyish-looking 37-year-old president, &quot;but they will take over many applications.&quot;    Born in Sweden and educated in Germany, Mr. Simonsson and two partners founded Rofin-Sinar in 1975 to sell other companies' lasers. Banks were reluctant to lend money to the new concern. In fact, the idea probably would have flopped without the backing of a venture capitalist, Eberhard Lohss, a Hamburg businessman who holds a majority interest.    The new company also had trouble recruiting personnel. &quot;People in Germany aren't as willing to take a professional risk,&quot; says Mr. Simonsson, an engineer by training. &quot;When I was in college I was amazed how many people had a fixed idea about their careers. They already knew what pension they could expect.&quot;    But by 1982 the company had achieved enough success that Mr. Simonsson was convinced he could make better lasers than the ones he was peddling.    Even competitors thought the new machines had promise: Spectra-Physics Inc. of San Jose, Calif., the largest commercial laser manufacturer, bought rights to sell one early Rofin-Sinar design in the U.S.    &quot;American companies are living off the technology of others,&quot; says Robert McCrory, who directs laser research at the University of Rochester. &quot;They aren't in the vanguard, pushing new applications.&quot; The Germans, on the other hand, are &quot;very, very competitive,&quot; he adds.    Rofin-Sinar has been particularly aggressive in its commercial development of German scientific discoveries. One of the company's newest lasers, Mr. Simonsson explains proudly, can cut thick steel plates with a beam six times as intense as previous designs.    Yet the machine -- about the size of two stacked caskets -- consumes only twice as much gas. A new technique uses radio waves to generate the laser beam, a process developed by a nearby German university.    Elsewhere on the company's shop floor, workers are building some of the 100 lasers that Rofin-Sinar will produce this year, which range in price from $50,000 to more than $1 million.    Yet even with its rapid growth, Rofin-Sinar is a midget among giants. SpectraPhysics's sales of $210 million in the year ended Sept. 30 dwarf Rofin-Sinar's projected $25 million for calendar 1986. Still, Mr. Simonsson sees advantages to being small -- including being nimble enough to exploit market opportunities in a rapidly changing field.    Mr. Simonsson figures his company must have something going for it -- or the competition wouldn't be trying to buy him out. &quot;We have an offer every two or three weeks,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm trying to think of new ways to say no.&quot;    ---              Output of Industrial Lasers                (Carbon dioxide type)               Japan           Germany         U.S. 1982           240              120           800 1983           350              180           925 1984           525              280          1100 1985           680              370          1550 1986           800              480          1800   Sources: Laser Focus Magazine; private consultants'estimates</TEXT></DOC>
