A report commissioned by The Villers Advocacy Associates and theNational Council of Senior Citizens said one or more energy taxes``is likely to develop strong political support'' in the push toreduce the federal deficit.   The report urged that those favoring higher energy taxesconsider ``the impact that these energy taxes would have on thepoor and on other Americans living on fixed incomes.''   ``Unlike those of us who may have become casual about our use ofenergy, the elderly poor cannot readily adopt conservationstrategies because for the most part they are already conservingwherever and however they can,'' the report said.   The report, based on Census and Energy Department data, saidabout 5.8 million elderly households with average annual incomes of$5,300 have only $500 a year left in so-called discretionary incomeafter paying existing housing, food and home energy costs.   ``The average low-income elderly household must pay forclothing, medicine, transportation and other necessities on abudget of less than $10 a week,'' it said. ``So a seemingly modestenergy tax that might be a minor annoyance to most consumers couldbe a severe shock to the elderly poor.   ``For affluent Americans, a new energy tax would be theequivalent of a luxury excise tax: mildly irritating butbearable.'' But for the elderly poor, such a tax ``would be acalamity,'' the report said.   ``If some sort of energy tax is enacted, and if that legislationfails to provide special protections for the poor, millions of ourneediest citizens _ especially low-income seniors _ will suffer asa result,'' said Ronald F. Pollack, director of the Villersorganization. ``An energy tax without low income protections willbe devastating to millions of persons.''   Lawrence T. Smedley, director of the senior citizens council,said, ``Clearly, any across-the-board energy taxes would leave thepoorest citizens with nothing but losing options.''</TEXT></DOC>
