However, the study left open questions about the drug's performance compared with Beecham Group PLC's Eminase, and about TPA's potential to cause bleeding in the brain.    The much-awaited findings were presented over the weekend in Atlanta, at a symposium held prior to the opening of the American College of Cardiology annual meeting.    An improved survival rate following administration of tissue plasminogen activator, or TPA, long had been theorized because of the drug's superior ability to open clogged arteries, when compared with an older drug, streptokinase. However, improved survival with TPA hadn't previously been statistically proved -- an unresolved issue that contributed to the hotly disputed delay in Food and Drug Administration approval, which was granted in November.    The study, conducted by the European Cooperative Study Group for TPA, involved more than 700 coronary patients, half of whom received TPA within five hours of a heart attack. The other half received an inactive substance, or placebo, for comparative purposes.    TPA reduced the number of patient deaths by 51% in the first two weeks after heart attack. Of the 350 patients who were given TPA, 2.8% died in that period. Of the 350 who received the placebo, 5.7% died.    TPA reduced deaths by 46% (to 3.7%, against 6.8% for those in the placebo group) for the duration of the hospital stay -- usually three to four weeks. But by three months following heart attack, TPA's improvement in patient mortality slipped to 36% (to 5.1% of the TPA patients from 7.9% in the placebo group).    Franz Van de Werf, of the University of Leuven in Belgium, the study's principal investigator, declared, &quot;This is the best in-hospital survival ever reported in a large scale study of thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) agents.&quot;    Harvard University cardiologist Eugene Braunwald said in an interview, &quot;It's very exciting. I'm very impressed with it. A mortality of 2.8% after two weeks is the lowest ever reported for acute myocardial infarction. It makes a very strong case for TPA.&quot;    Genentech stock, which had traded at $45 to $46 a share in early March, closed Friday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading at $41.125, down 50 cents, in a broadly lower market.    However, some securities analysts who had been expecting Genentech to report a lasting improvement in coronary survival -- 55% or better -- seemed slightly deflated by the figures in the 40% range.    &quot;It isn't all that much better than Eminase,&quot; said Stuart Weisbrod, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities, referring to Beecham's clot-dissolving drug, which reduced deaths 47% after 30 days and 44% after a year. No comparable one-year survival data are yet available for TPA.    &quot;It doesn't seem as impressive as I had expected and had been led by the company to expect. They led analysts to believe it was better than both streptokinase and Eminase,&quot; Mr. Weisbrod added.    Also, TPA's ability to cause intracranial hemorrhage -- or bleeding into the brain, a potentially fatal complication -- was raised again. The incidence of such side effects in the European study was 1.4% -- much higher than the 0.4% incidence listed on the label for doses at the currently accepted 100-milligram level. This incidence matches that experienced in the U.S. when patients received the old dose of 150 milligrams, although all the European patients received the 100-milligram dose, Dr. Braunwald said.    &quot;I think a 1.4% intracranial hemorrhage rate sounds awful high. I'd be concerned about that,&quot; said Jeffrey Anderson, chief of cardiology at Latter Day Saints Hospital in Salt Lake City.    TPA researchers emphasized that the accumulated experience of using TPA in more than 3,700 patients in U.S. studies shows the average risk to be 0.4%. Referring to the European study, Dr. Braunwald suggested statistical variations may appear much wider in such a relatively small group, and maintained that the true risk is &quot;about one half of 1%.&quot;    In general, analysts believe that TPA's short-term survival benefits will become a potent marketing tool in the hands of South San Francisco, Calif.-based Genentech's aggressive sales force -- at least for the next two years. But several analysts said that TPA's longer-term performance so far doesn't give it clear superiority over Beecham's Eminase, which is expected to make its U.S. debut in 1990.    &quot;The bottom line is that there's going to be a very close horse race between TPA and Eminase&quot; in the 1990s, Prudential-Bache's Mr. Weisbrod said. </TEXT></DOC>
