Police said a strike called Friday by Sinhalese radicals toprotest 150 deaths disrupted normal life in the island nation, andat least 15 people died in ethnic violence since Thursday,including a Bhuddist priest.   About 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to enforce a July1987 peace accord aimed at ending a Tamil ethnic strife in theIndian Ocean republic, where the government is dominated by theSinhalese majority.   Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry sources said the Indian offer cameFriday before the two sides ended a weeklong talk in New Delhiaimed at finding ways to make India withdraw its troops.   ``At this moment I can say that the talks went on well,'' SriLankan High Commissioner, or Ambassador S.S.P.P. Kalpage said.``There are proposals and counter-proposals, and also there are ifsand buts,'' Kalpage said in New Delhi, the Indian capital.   But Sri Lankian Foreign Ministry sources in Colombo said Indiaagreed to withdraw 1,500 troops a week provided the main Tamilguerrilla group, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, observed acease-fire and that no Indians are attacked.   The withdrawal also was conditional on Sri Lanka agreeing togive more powers to the Tamil adminstration in the north and eastof Sri Lanka, where Tamils are a majority.   Indian government officials in New Delhi were not available forcomment on the proposal. India has said that a hasty withdrawalcould cause even more bloodshed.   Sinhalese-language posters signed by the guerrillas of theSinhalese People's Liberation Front warned businesses to closeFriday to protest the killing of 150 people by security forces aweek ago.   Police and witnesses said the daylong strike appeared to besuccessful as the usually-bustling capital was deserted. Shops andoffices were closed and vehicles stayed off the street.   At least 150 people were killed July 28 when supporters of theradicals defied a nationwide curfew and demonstrated against thecontinued presence of Indian troops. Sinhalese radicals also opposethe autonomy plan for Tamils.   The government had said curfew violators would be shot on sightto prevent what it calls a campaign of terror by the militants. Thecurfew remains in effect from dusk to dawn.   In Colombo, two Sinhalese men were killed Friday when a bombthey were carrying exploded in Colombo, police said. A Sinhalesewoman was killed when troops fired at her vehicle which it did notstop at a checkpoint.   The priest, Kotikawatte Saddhatissa, was killed Thursday nightby six gunmen in a Colombo temple, police said. The gunmen weresuspected members of the Sinhalese People's Liberation Front, saidpolice officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Saddhatissa, 72, a supporter of President Ranasinghe Premadasa,is the second religious leader to be killed by the radicals. InFebruary, the front's gunmen killed Bodaramulle Subitha, the headpriest of the Kalutara temple, 25 miles south of Colombo.   Six Indian soldiers and five Tamil Tiger militants were killedin a gunbattle in the northern Jaffna peninsula on Thursday, saidIndian officials in New Delhi, speaking on condition of anonymity.Some civilians were also killed, they said.   Authorities blame the Sinhalese radicals for at least 4,000killings and a series of crippling strikes since the start of ananti-government uprising two years ago.   At least 11,000 people, including 1,000 Indian soldiers, havebeen killed in the 6-year-old Tamil insurgency.   India became involved in the peace plan because of pressuresfrom its own 60 million Tamils who are sympathetic to the rebelcause.   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people,have been fighting for an independent nation since 1983, claimingthey are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who make up 75percent of the population and control the government and themilitary.</TEXT></DOC>
