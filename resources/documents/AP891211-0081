(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A fierce ice storm left eight people deadand two multimillion-dollar television towers in pieces on theground, and forecasters said more bad weather was on the way.   The National Weather Service said a second storm system wouldhit the state beginning in the mountains tonight and graduallyspreading east on Tuesday and Wednesday.   The blast of wintry weather that moved into the state over theweekend spread thick layers of ice on roadways and cut offelectrical service to thousands. Police reported hundreds oftraffic accidents, and at least eight people died.   Western states also were hit with wintry conditions. At Denver'sStapleton International Airport, there were extensive delays Sundaybecause of the storm but officials said the situation was bettertoday.   In Colorado east of the Continental Divide, a slew of caraccidents were reported Sunday, including a 20-car pileup onInterstate 25 near Johnstown that closed the highway for two hours.Three people suffered minor injuries in that accident.

In North Carolina, towers for WPTF-TV and WRAL-TV, both Raleighstations, collapsed Sunday within a half hour of each other, saidspokesmen at the stations said. The towers stand side-by-side inAuburn, a community south of Raleigh.   Witnesses said it appeared melting ice destabilized the2,000-foot structures. The stations estimated damage to the twotowers at $12 million and said it could be weeks before they wouldbe broadcasting at full power.   ``I heard something. It sounded like ice,'' said Sue Williams, aresident who lives near the towers. ``I saw it folding up just likean accordion or folding ladder.''   Adjacent to the towers, a third tower was left leaning to oneside under the weight of the ice.   The storm blew in Friday, dumping several inches of snow in thestate's northern mountains, and began crawling across the state,spitting sleet and glazing roads with ice.   North Carolina Power spokesman Randy Shillingburg said it wasone of the most severe storms the utility has had in recent years.About 8,500 of the utility's 90,000 customers remained withoutelectricity this morning, he said.   Duke Power Co. said 10,000 Charlotte-area customers were withoutpower at some point during the storm, but service was substantiallyback to normal today.   The storm stranded travelers, both by air and car. Roads in theRaleigh area Sunday morning where littered with abandoned cars.Many flights were delayed and some were canceled at Raleigh-DurhamInternational Airport. on Saturday as airport officialsintermittently closed ice-slickened runways.
