The Japan Iron and Steel Federation said overall exports decreased 14% from a year earlier and 9.5% from October, to 8,088,000 metric tons. Although exports of a few specialized products rose, total shipments continued to suffer because of the strong yen and stiff competition from other Asian steel-producing countries.    But exports to the U.S. surged 52%, to 359,000 tons. In October, such exports had increased 28%. A federation spokesman said shipments apparently were helped by strong demand, especially for sheet products, and by a loosening of export curbs.    Separately, the Japan Foreign Trade Council said export contracts concluded by 17 major Japanese trading houses fell 19% in November from a year earlier, while import contracts rose 9.7%. The council's data provide an early indication of short-term Japanese trade trends. The 17 companies together handle about 50% of Japan's exports and 65% of its imports. </TEXT></DOC>
