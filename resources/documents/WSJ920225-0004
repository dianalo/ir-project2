Fletcher Challenge Canada Ltd. and MacMillan Bloedel Ltd.officials confirmed that they will raise the North Americanprice of northern bleached softwood kraft pulp by US$40 ametric ton to $580 a metric ton on April 1. Both companiesare based in Vancouver, British Columbia.</LP><TEXT>   Industry executives and analysts said Canadian PacificForest Products Ltd. and Repap Enterprises Corp. alsoannounced the price increase to customers. Canadian PacificForest Products officials didn't return calls and RepapEnterprises officials couldn't be reached. Both companies arebased in Montreal.   The planned April 1 price rise follows two smaller priceincreases this year. Canadian producers raised the NorthAmerican price of northern softwood pulp by $20 a metric tonto $520 a metric ton on Jan. 1 and by an additional $20 ametric ton to $540 a metric ton on Feb. 1. A metric tonequals 2,204.6 pounds.   Industry executives and analysts said it isn't certain theApril 1 price increase will stick, since demand is weak formany of the paper products made from pulp.   The list price of northern softwood pulp peaked at $840 ametric ton in 1990 before hitting a low of $500 in 1991,below the production cost of the pulp for most Canadianproducers. Canada is the world's largest exporter of marketpulp. The premium northern softwood pulp accounts for about75% of Canada's pulp exports. Market pulp is wood pulp soldon the open market to producers of paper and other products.</TEXT></DOC>
