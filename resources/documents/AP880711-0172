Ross Perotand ruled that it will hear complaints about the contract.   The Postal Service maintains the GSA does not have authorityover the contract, but on Friday suspended its contract with Perotbecause the GSA's Board of Contract Appeals had ordered the pactsuspended.   ``The Postal Service continues to believe that the contractappeals board does not have jurisdiction,'' said Jim Van Loozen, aspokesman for the Postal Service.   But ``we would hope that they would now bring those matters tosome conclusion ... and rule promptly on those protests,'' VanLoozen added.   At least two competitors of Perot had complained to thecontracts board about the pact, under which Perot agreed to studyways to improve the agency's efficiency.   Van Loozen said the contract dispute concerns whether the PostalService complied with the Brooks Act, a law outlining contractingprocedures for most federal entities.   ``We have already agreed that we did not comply with the act.The postal reorganization act of 1970, that set up the PostalService as an independent agency, gives us specific authority tocontract for ourselves,'' said Van Loozen.   The agency last week asked the federal appeals court to rule onwhether the GSA contracts board has jurisdiction over itsactivities. No date has been set for that hearing.</TEXT></DOC>
