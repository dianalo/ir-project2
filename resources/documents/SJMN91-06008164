But the rumor isthat Nintendo will bring a version of its 16-bit Super Famicom game system tothe United States later this year. This unit is currently available in Japanfor $170.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NINTENDO RUMORED READY TO LEAP INTO 16-BITWATERS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  ConsumerThe Gadget Guru  </MEMO><TEXT>     If this rumor is true, it could spell a problem. The Japanese version isnot compatible with existing Nintendo game cartridges -- meaning purchasers ofthis new system would have to buy all new game cartridges.;    One solutioncould be to provide an adapter that would allow the older cartridges to beplayed on the new unit. Another option could be to make the new unit nothingmore than an adapter that attaches to the existing Nintendo EntertainmentSystem.;    Rumors aside, it seems that Nintendo would be smart to do nothingnow but wait to see what happens with the economy. A prudent move would be toconcentrate its efforts and dollars on the growing Gameboy hand-heldbusiness.;    Electronic piano teacher;  One new product designed for use withthe Nintendo Entertainment System is Software Toolworks' Miracle PianoTeaching System. For $350 (more than three times the price of the NintendoEntertainment System), this unit is the most expensive Nintendo accessory yet.But when you learn what it does, the cost quickly justifies itself.;    TheMiracle includes a full-size electronic piano keyboard and a Nintendocartridge. The cartridge is programmed with the equivalent of one years' worthof piano lessons. It features a personalized assortment of drills, musicalpieces and games that work in conjunction with the keyboard to teach thefundamentals of piano playing.;    The Miracle uses artificial intelligencetechnology -- so it &quot;knows&quot; how and when the user is pressing each key. TheMiracle isolates trouble spots in note recognition, fingering and rhythm andcreates customized lessons to meet individual needs.

This unit features a3.2-inch color screen that promises to deliver the finest graphics ever seenon a hand-held system.;    Unlike NEC, whose hand-held TurboExpress uses thesame game software as its TurboGrafx home system, Sega's Game Gear, likeNintendo's Gameboy, will require its own dedicated game software that will notbe compatible with the home system. Game Gear will be available later thisyear and sell for $170.;    The real thing -- for $650;  Just when you thoughtit was safe to go shopping again, a new home video game system is starting toshow up on retailers' shelves. It's called NEO-GEO, and not only is it themost exciting new game system on the market, it also is the most expensive.;   For $650, the NEO-GEO includes the main console, two controllers and onegame. Additional games will retail for $200. For the purist, this game is adream.;    While Nintendo, Sega and NEC bill their systems as arcade-like, theNEO-GEO can safely be called the real arcade game. It has superb graphics,sound, action and control.;    Other than being sold in stores, early planscall for this unit to show up in video stores as a rental item. It isavailable from Video Express, (800) 253-6665).  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Andy Pargh column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  588  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 8, 199100008164,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
