The Bush administration fought hard for interstatebranching this year in its banking reform efforts. Officialsargued that interstate branching reduces overhead costs forbanks and Sandamp;Ls, and that the institutions could diminish riskby diversifying geographically. But Congress stripped thebranching proposal from bank reform legislation after smallbanks, which feared they would be gobbled up by largercompetitors, lobbied hard against it.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The main thing this will do for existing, stronginstitutions, is to allow them to diversify risk,&quot; saidTimothy Ryan, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision.Because loans wouldn't have to be concentrated in one area,he said, lenders wouldn't be vulnerable to local economicdownturns.   Thrifts seeking to expand still would have to apply tofederal regulators for authority to open branches in otherstates. They also would have to meet certain solvencycriteria, and comply with the Community Reinvestment Act,which requires lending to all sectors of their communities.   Current branching regulations are uneven. Federal rulesrequire any financial institution that wants to open a branchin another state to purchase a failing institution there.Over the years, such Sandamp;Ls as First Nationwide, a unit of FordMotor Co., have made acquisitions that permitted them toobtain significant branching rights.   Since the early 1980s, regulators also have allowedfederal Sandamp;Ls to branch into states where state law permittedsuch branching, but just 13 states have passed such laws.   The proposed change would particularly help institutionsin markets that straddle state borders. Bankers First Corp.of Savannah, Ga., the parent of Bankers First Federal Savingsand Loan, for instance, operates in Georgia near the SouthCarolina and Tennessee borders. In its Rossville, Ga.,branch, 50% of the customers are from Tennessee. &quot;We havechecking account customers in Rossville who can't use the{automatic teller machines} in Tennessee,&quot; says the thrift'spresident, Monty Osteen. &quot;This change would free us to pursueour customers with brick-and-mortar and ATMs.&quot;   The change, if enacted, might add value to the failed Sandamp;Lsbeing marketed by the savings and loan bailout agency, theResolution Trust Corp. &quot;You could buy a thrift and thenbranch anywhere,&quot; said Patrick Forte, president of theAssociation of Financial Institution Holding Companies. &quot;Thisis a very big deal.&quot;   The new rule was sent to the Federal Register forpublication, and could be enacted 30 days later. Privately,thrift officials say they are bracing for opposition fromsmall banks and consumer groups. Some consumers groups havecontended that big institutions banks might suck up depositsand then be stingy with loans locally.</TEXT></DOC>
