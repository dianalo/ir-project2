(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Space shuttle Discovery will liftoff after dark on a secret Thanksgiving week military mission, thefirst of three dazzling nighttime launches scheduled here in fourweeks.   NASA announced the Nov. 20 Discovery launch date Tuesday aftershuttle managers concluded a two day-review that assessed thereadiness of the orbiter, the payload, the global tracking networkand all other aspects of the mission.   The space agency said the liftoff would occur during a four-hourperiod starting at 6:30 p.m., only the third night launch in 32shuttle flights. The precise time will not be made public untilnine minutes before launch to make it harder for Sovietreconnaissance ships to track the shuttle.   Martin Marietta also announced Tuesday that it will launch thefirst commercial payloads on its huge Titan 3 rocket on the nightof Dec. 8. They will be communications satellites for Japan andGreat Britain.   NASA earlier announced the scheduled after-dark launch of spaceshuttle Columbia on Dec. 18, to deploy a communications satelliteand to track down and return to Earth a science satellite that hasbeen in orbit more than five years.   The late Discovery and Titan launches are necessary to place thesatellites in desired orbits. The Columbia liftoff is timed to putthe shuttle on course to intercept the satellite to be retrieved.   While Discovery's crew is scheduled to be in space onThanksgiving, Columbia's 10-day mission will have its astronauts inorbit on Christmas.   The trio of night launches should provide a brilliant fireworksdisplay for rocket watchers for hundreds of miles around.   When Atlantis lifted off on the last shuttle night mission inNovember, 1985, its 700-tail of fire was clearly visible from KeyWest, Fla., to Georgia, and in Fort Myers, 150 miles away onFlorida's southwest coast.   Discovery's payload on the Nov. 20 flight will be a $300million, 2{-ton satellite for monitoring Soviet missile tests andeavesdropping on military and diplomatic communications, saidreliable sources who requested anonymity. Another team of Discoveryastronauts launched a similar satellite in 1985.   The crew for the upcoming mission is: Air Force Col. FrederickC. Gregory, the commander; Air Force Col. John Blaha, the pilot;and mission specialists Navy Capt. Manley L. Carter Jr., F. StoryMusgrave and Kathryn C. Thornton.</TEXT></DOC>
