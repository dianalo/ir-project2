 What LAN-based e-mail has accomplished in just a few shortyears (did anyone really use e-mail before 1985?), however, is startling.andM;Workers fortunate enough to use e-mail benefit from almost immediate accessto information that used to take days or even weeks to reach them--some primeexamples might include your subordinates' status reports, weekly or dailysales figures, or the boss's thoughts about a particular project.andP;  E-mailplays a major role in personnel policies at many companies too: Instead ofsending out monthly (or even quarterly) newsletters, a company can use e-mailto keep its employees informed with up-to-the-minute information.andM;E-mail has made it simpler, faster, and more efficient to exchange datafiles, make (and break) appointments, set up important meetings, even nurturea budding love affair.andM;There is a price to be paid for all these benefits, however.andP;  You may nolonger have a desk piled high with old memos, appointment books, and reports,but now you've got an electronic mail box overflowing with outdated messages.andM;Perhaps you can't locate an important message your boss sent you (and thedeadline for completing the project she mentioned is rapidly approaching).andO;Or it took you 20 minutes to find a particular message; or (horrors!) youforwarded a love letter to a network-wide distribution list because youaccidentally attached it to a new message.andM;You realize you shouldn't keep all your e-mail messages active, yet you can'tquite force yourself to simply delete them (for one thing, you enjoyre-reading the love letters too much).andP;  This despite the fact you'recontinually forced to renumber the messages in your e-mail folder, and thatyour system administrator keeps threatening you with expulsion from thee-mail system unless you free some precious network disk space.andM;No Longer OptionalandM;For many workers, e-mail has become a non-optional resource, just likeregular mail services.andP;  Users are demanding more sophisticated e-mailmanagement capabilities.andP;  They're demanding the ability to rearrange, sort,and archive their electronic mail.andP;  They want electronic mail applicationsthat give them the ability to send, receive, and manage all the typical kindsof mail they receive, not just textual, but those including facsimiles,photos, and other kinds of artwork.andP;  And they want to be able to do it allquickly, without learning new tricks.andM;&quot;I see e-mail becoming more than just a mechanism to communicate betweenindividuals,&quot; agrees David Martin, director of marketing for Oracle's officeautomation division, which develops and markets the Belmont, Calif.,andO;company's OracleMail.andP;  &quot;We believe e-mail will be more and more used fordistributing many types of information, and that information will notnecessarily be generated by an individual, but by the company.&quot;andM;In great demand, he says, are capabilities that allow applications programssuch as inventory-control packages and spreadsheets to exchange messagesbetween themselves.andP;  While operating in a client-server environment, e-mailcapabilities would be an integral part of the inventory, financial, ordatabase program, giving users much faster access to competitive information.andO;These kinds of features would give users the ability to query and receiveautomatic reports from various resources on a network--for example, accessthe financial data in the corporate mainframe over the network from aPC-based application.andM;&quot;This takes the burden off MIS and puts it on the application,&quot; adds Martin,&quot;and it does so with an interface [the PC application's] end users areaccustomed to using every day.andP;  E-mail is also being incorporated intocompanies' workflow management systems, helping them manage individuals' andorganizations' daily tasks.andM;&quot;This is all about office productivity, and a good part of that is movinginformation arcund the organization,&quot; Martin explains.andP;  &quot;This may be assimple as sending e-mail notes, or as complex as getting a new piece of[user] documentation [with its associated writing-editing-review process thatdemands the coordination of numerous people] out the door.&quot;andM;Two Dozen-PlusandM;ContendersandM;No matter what the level of functionality your network users require, fromthe simple--that is, little more than the ability to send and receivemessages among the members of a small workgroup--to the complex--forinstance, the capacity to communicate with e-mail gateways, includingelectronic facsimile gateways--rest assured that many choices exist for thoseplanning to add or upgrade an existing electronic mail system.andM;The more than two dozen e-mail packages on the market (see accompanyingchart) offer an array of features, performance, and compatibility for justabout every need and/or network operating system available.andP;  For instance,most vendors selling e-mail offer versions for Novell's (Provo, Utah) NetWareand 3Com's (Santa Clara, Calif.) 3+, two of the more widely installed networkoperating systems (NOSs).andP;  There are also abundant mail applications for theOS/2, Unix, Windows, and the Macintosh operating environments.andM;On another level of functionality, most also allow transferring the principaltypes of electronically encoded information--whether it be typed text, fax,graphics, spreadsheet files, even photos or color slides--typically in use intoday's electronic business office.andM;That noted, it's also important to point out that few e-mail productsactually let you view all these types of files through the mail application.andO;These generally send such data files as &quot;attachments&quot; that must subsequentlybe opened via an appropriate application--a graphics program, spreadsheet,etc.andM;As for popularity, 3Com's 3+Mail (and eventually, by default, its 3+OpenMail) and cc:Mail Inc.'s (Mountain View, Calif.) cc:Mail appear to be the twoe-mail marketshare leaders, each with approximately 30 percent of the market,according to cc:Mail's Phillip (Flip) Whalen, the company's vice president ofmarketing.andP;  In fact, they were both among the e-mail packages mentioned asbest sellers by the LAN VAR 100 resellers in their responses to LANMagazine's recent VAR survey.andM;Enable's (Alameda, Calif.) Higgins/Higgins Mail, OracleMail, and ConsumersSoftware's (Vancouver, B.C.) Network Courier were other e-mail applicationsconsistently mentioned by members of the LAN VAR 100.andP;  Here's a brief look atsome of the advanced features of packages.andM;Mixed Media from cc:MailandM;cc:Mail's Whalen, like Oracle's Martin, says his product is aimed at theFortune 1000 market: &quot;We compete with mainframe companies&quot; e-mail products,he says.andP;  &quot;We're taking business away from the 'big guys' because we canprovide an entire solution.&quot;andM;At the heart of cc:Mail is a multiuser, multithread database that acts as thesystem's post office.andP;  This post office can handle hundreds of individualmail boxes and messages with mainframe-like performance.andP;  One of cc:Mail'skey features is that, when a user sends a single message to multipleusers--e.g., a &quot;broadcast&quot; or &quot;cc&quot; message--it creates one central file inthe server database, not one for each recipient.andP;  A &quot;pointer&quot; to that file ineach recipient's mail box tells the recipient he or she has a message.andM;With even small e-mail messages, this conserves considerable system RAM whilelimiting traffic over the network.andP;  With large files and attachments, it canmean the difference between adding more disk space or subdividing a network.andO;These types of conservation measures are especially important on large e-mailsystems, where thousands of e-mail messages and other files cross networkwire daily.andP;  Any reduction in network traffic translates to substantial costsavings--for example, by reducing the number of new pieces of networkequipment a company must buy.andM;cc:Mail offers a variety of features not generally available from itscompetitors' products.andP;  Of particular value is the ability to send--and, atthe receiving end, view--in a single message a combination of text, graphics,photo, and fax files via the e-mail application.andP;  Whalen likens cc:Mail'smixed-media message format to a Fed Ex envelope.andP;  Such a package couldinclude a letter describing an important meeting, a copy of acomputer-generated map to the meeting site, photos of those taking part inthe meeting, and a copy of a fax from one of those people.andM;The difference between a Fed Ex package and cc:Mail, of course, is that eachcc:Mail component is presented electronically as integral attachments to themessage.andP;  cc:Mail lets you look at each of these components individually fromwithin cc:Mail; most other e-mail programs require you to exit e-mail andenter an appropriate application--a graphics package to view anelectronically sent fax or scanner-encoded photo, for instance.andM;cc:Mail offers both text and graphics editors--the latter lets users createthe site maps such as the one mentioned in the above example--and allowsusers to select their own personal color.andP;  This capability is particularlyuseful when replying to or annotating others' messages: Your comments show updistinctively in red, blue, purple, or whatever color you've selected.andP;  Andthe company plans to add digitized voice mail capabilities soon.andM;Without going into greater detail--cc:Mail's database-search capabilities,for example, allow you to move from A to Z in a 20,000-name post office in afraction of a second--suffice it to say that cc:Mail is an excellent e-mailproduct that offers more functionality than most typical users will everneed.andM;A Look at OracleMailandM;Oracle's OracleMail is similar to cc:Mail in that it, too, depends on acentral database server and uses a pointer-like system for distributingmultiple copies of a single e-mail message.andP;  OracleMail is based on thecompany's Relational Database Management System (RDBMS), which is availablefor 80 to 100 various server platforms--from PCs up to Digital VAXes andmainframes--and operates in a client-server environment.andP;  Because OracleMailis available on such a wide range of systems, it can deliver mail to users ina truly heterogenous environment, says Martin.andP;  Client PCs on an OracleMailsystem can thus communicate with PC servers as easily as VAX servers.andM;Oracle's David Martin says the single-message-with-pointer capability isespecially important in the Fortune 1000 types of installations in whichOracleMail is generally found.andP;  System administrators of these large networksare concerned with network traffic, and generating 5,000 copies of one e-mailmessage--as would be necessary for a broadcast message over the types oflarge installations in which OracleMail is found--would bring many LANs totheir knees, performance-wise.andM;Martin cites the case of one organization with a 30-server e-mail networkwith thousands of users that, prior to the installation of OracleMail,finally had to disallow user-generated broadcast messages.andP;  Instead, thosewishing to send out such mail had to first send them to a data center, wherethey were then grouped and sent as a single message at 2 a.m., when networktraffic was at a minimum.andM;With OracleMail, however, that practice has been eliminated.andP;  &quot;In the worstcase,&quot; says Martin, &quot;they send one message to each of the 30 servers.andP;  That'sa rather significant cut&quot; in e-mail-generated network traffic.andM;Unlike cc:Mail, OracleMail doesn't allow viewing non-textual files (faxes,graphics, etc.) in the mail application.andP;  However, OracleMail does offer anobject-based user interface, that graphically identifies file types for quickvisual recognition.andP;  The in-mail viewing capability will be included in thenext major revision of the product, promises Martin.andM;OracleMail also offers an application program interface (API) that allowsdevelopers to integrate it into other applications.andP;  This API lets OracleMaildistribute application-based information over the network and create gatewaysto other mail systems.andM;3+Mail: First of the LotandM;3Com's 3+Mail may not really have been the first e-mail product designed forLAN use, but it certainly was the first big hit in the field.andP;  This was duein part to the fact that 3Com's 3+ network operating system, for which 3+Mailwas originally designed to operate with, was among the first of the widelydistributed NOSs.andM;But 3+Mail was also among the first products to offer a highly functional,menu-based e-mail system that was also easy for users to learn and to use.andO;3+Mail was also among the first e-mail products to offer mixedPC-to-Macintosh connectivity over the Ethernet, Token Ring, and LocalTalkenvironments.andM;3+Open Mail is 3Com's OS/2 LAN Manager version of 3+Mail; 3Com has indicatedit will market this product as a value-added application for all versions ofMicrosoft's LAN Manager.andP;  Like 3+Mail, 3+Open Mail works with 3Com's globalnaming service to route mail around the network; this feature (similarservices are used with most e-mail packages) allows users to send mail with aminimum of knowledge about the network.andM;As already noted, 3Com has pioneered easy-to-use e-mail interfaces: 3+OpenMail gives users the option of accessing e-mail functions viaspecial-function keys or pull-down menus, and the DOS and OS/2 interfaces areidentical.andP;  The product also lets users customize their e-mail boxes,organizing them into folders by various criteria: for instance, by project,by sender, or by topic.andM;3+Open Mail also offers a fairly wide range of options to send and receivemail to and from other mail systems and gateways; these include connectionsto X.400, IBM PROFS, DEC's All-In-One, MIC Mail, and the Wang Office.andM;Other LeadersandM;Among other top e-mail packages available are Higgins Mail, TOPS In-Box,Consumers Software's Network Courier, and Action Technologies' TheCoordinator.andP;  Other major players in the market include ATandamp;T's StarMail,Hewlett-Packard's OpenMail, and WordPerfect's Office.andP;  As the accompanyingchart shows, these products are available for a variety of environments.andM;What the chart doesn't elaborate on, of course, are the features that makeany one program a viable selection for a particular company.andP;  Of thosementioned, the e-mail functions provided by Higgins Mail, WordPerfect'sOffice, and Action Technologies' The Coordinator are parts of integratedapplications.andP;  Depending on the company, these provide gateway services,modem access via e-mail, and maintain personal on-line calendars in additionto allowing users to send, receive, sort, and otherwise manage e-mail.andM;The fact that we didn't cover the other packages listed in detail wasn'tmeant to detract from their capabilities or features; each of those listedmay or may not be suited to a particular environment or business.andP;  Thoseorganizations installing or upgrading electronic mail capabilities on thegrowing number of enterprisewide networks, however, should take a seriouslook at cc:Mail and OracleMail before making any final choices.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
