Broyles, 28, of Ventura, one of three anti-abortion activists whose1989 protest at a Ventura clinic led to the court's ruling, said that he wasnot surprised by the decision.;    &quot;This is kind of what we were expecting,(but) it's not over for us, by any means,&quot; Broyles said.;    Ventura Countyprosecutor Michael Schwartz, who argued against the necessity defense in ahearing last month, also said that he was expecting the ruling, although fordifferent reasons.;    &quot;I would have been very surprised if the court wouldhave permitted that (the necessity defense), because it really would have ledto anarchy,&quot; Schwartz said.;    Broyles and his two co-defendants were allowedto use the necessity defense during their trial on misdemeanor trespassingcharges. After they were convicted, however, the defendants argued on appealthat there were errors in the way the issue was presented to the jury.;    Theappellate department of the Ventura County Superior Court ruled in Decemberthat the necessity defense is improper in abortion cases. The ruling could notbe cited as precedent, however, so the issue was taken to the state Court ofAppeal.;    Ventura attorney Robert Silver, who represented the protesters,said the latest ruling might be appealed to the California Supreme Court.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Daily News  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Ventura  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910518  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  313  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday May 18, 199100139038,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
