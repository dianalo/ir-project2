DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former White House chief of staff Donald T.Regan, who says he can take it as well as dish it out, gets achance to prove it one week after taking literary swipes at thepresident and first lady Nancy Reagan.   In a book coming out this week, one-time presidential domesticpolicy adviser Martin Anderson pictures Regan as a cocksure aidefollowing his own impulses, ``apparently unaware of the potentialcost to President Reagan.''   Anderson's isn't the only counterpunch thrown at Regan, whosebook ``For the Record'' depicts the president as a hesitantdecision-maker and says the first lady meddled in White Houseaffairs, often on the basis of astrological advice.   David M. Abshire, a special White House counselor during theIran-Contra crisis, writes in The Washington Post that Regan``often seemed more concerned with his own welfare _ how he wouldcome out _ than with the president's.''   Both Regan's book, which came out last week, and Anderson's arepublished by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.   On the CBS television program ``Face the Nation'' Sunday, Regansaid, ``I think I have been very fair and very honest.''   Of the ensuing criticism, he said, ``Sure, they have to hurt,somewhat. But, look, I'm a big boy. I've been around, and I knewthis was coming. So, I'm prepared to take it.''   Anderson, who interviewed Regan among others in preparation forhis book, ``Revolution,'' discusses the former chief of staff'sdecision in October 1985 to disband a group of government economicadvisers.   The group, the President's Economic Policy Advisory Board, ofwhich Anderson became a member after leaving the White House in1982, met with the president four times a year. Regan, after movingto the White House from his previous post as secretary of thetreasury, refused to renew the executive order creating it.   ``As chief of staff, with unprecedented power delegated to himby President Reagan, Regan evidently decided to tidy up the policyadvisory structure,'' Anderson wrote in his book. ``And nobodyoutside a small group in the inner, upper reaches of the WhiteHouse knew it. Probably not even President Reagan.   ``It was a small incident but it revealed something about DonaldRegan's character _ such a strong degree of assurance andself-confidence in his own judgment _ that he unhesitatinglyfollowed his impulse, apparently unaware of the potential cost toPresident Reagan. It was a hint of a character flaw that would bedeepened and widened by the decisions forced upon him in the monthsthat followed, a flaw that perhaps helped plunge President Reaganinto the abyss of the Iran-Contra affair within a year.''   In February 1987, the presidentially appointed Tower Commissionsaid that Regan ``must bear primary responsibility for the chaosthat descended on the White House'' after the revelations of secretarms sales to Iran and diversion of funds to Nicaraguan rebels.   At this time, Abshire wrote in an article published Sunday inthe Post, he called on Regan and recommended that he ``step outnow, rather than be pushed out'' and that he ``write a book ... onthe high ground _ about the genuine dilemmas of government and theWhite House.''   ``He took neither the advice to leave earlier, nor to write ahigh-minded book,'' said Abshire. ``He went out not with dignitybut, as he said, `like a shoe clerk.'''   Regan, in his book, wrote that his dismissal as chief of staffwas ``the bitterest event of my life'' and ``destroyed myfriendship with the president to whom I had devoted six years ofloyal and (as it seemed to me) unselfish service.''   Asked Sunday if he had made mistakes in his relations with Mrs.Reagan, Regan said, ``To the extent that she wants yes-men aroundher, I was not a yes-man and that was a mistake.''   Abshire, however, wrote that Mrs. Reagan, while the presidentwas convalescing from prostate surgery early in 1987, ``did exactlythe opposite'' of Mrs. Woodrow Wilson, who cut off access toPresident Wilson after he suffered a stroke.   ``Nancy Reagan encouraged me to speak up and tell the presidentfrankly about the problems that faced his presidency,'' the formercounselor wrote. ``My dealings with the first lady impressed mefirst, that she is a political realist and, second, that she doesnot dominate this strong-minded president.''</TEXT></DOC>
