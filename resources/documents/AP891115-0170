Abortion Controls</HEAD><BYLINE>By MICHAEL BLOOD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pennsylvania's passage of the nation'sstrictest abortion controls raises the possibility of a courtchallenge, but abortion rights advocates were uncertain Wednesdaywhether a lawsuit would help their cause.   The bill, which Gov. Robert P. Casey is expected to sign withindays, was drafted to conflict directly with provisions in theSupreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade ruling, which establishedabortion as a constitutional right, leading supporters have said.   Abortion rights activists were in a quandary because an attemptto overturn the bill's provisions might open the way for appealsthat could weaken Roe vs. Wade further.   In July, the U.S. Supreme Court gave states greater leeway torestrict abortions; Pennsylvania's law would be the first to takeadvantage of that.   ``We're not going to waltz blindly into any traps. At the sametime, we're going to fight as aggressively as you could imagine tostrike down the parts of this bill that violate women'sconstitutional rights,'' said Sue Frietsche of the state AmericanCivil Liberties Union.   Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, a spokeswoman for PlannedParenthood-Pennsylvania Affiliates, predicted a suit would befiled, but suggested it would be structured in a way that would notnecessarily endanger Roe vs. Wade. Any legal action was notexpected for at least several weeks.   But abortion opponents said the abortion rights camp would takesignificant risks in challenging the new provisions.   ``The pro-choice side is in a Catch-22 position. If they allowthe bill to stand, we've got a good bill in Pennsylvania. ... Ifthey don't challenge, clearly other states will look at thislegislation and say, `We'll at least get this much.' That's not intheir interest,'' said Denise Neary, Pennsylvania director of theNational Right To Life Committee.   The bill, which the Senate passed Tuesday, would represent themost restrictive abortion controls in the nation.   It would require women to notify their husbands if they plan toget an abortion; prohibit abortions because of the fetus' sex; banabortions after the 24th week of pregnancy, except in cases wherethe mother faces death or irreversible harm; and establish a24-hour waiting period.   Also, doctors would be required to inform a woman of the likelyage of the fetus before performing an abortion and explain therisks and alternatives. The proposal would regulate the medical useof tissue from aborted fetuses.   Abortion rights advocates say the prohibition on sex-selectionabortions is in direct conflict with the Supreme Court's ban onrestrictions during the first trimester of pregnancy. Anotherpotential clash is the spousal notification, which pro-choiceleaders have labeled unconstitutional. A third area of disputecould be the 24-week provision, which would place a ban onabortions during a period that the court has permitted limitedrestrictions.   The purpose of the sex-selection ban ``is to overthrow Roe vs.Wade completely and allow state legislatures to ban abortion at anytime for any reason and do away with the trimester system,'' Ms.Hrenda-Roberts said.   A leading pro-choice legislator, Republican state Sen. JamesGreenwood, predicted that if provisions are challenged and upheld,``Then the dam is open.''   ``My instincts are that we are probably better off not havingthis becoming the case to challenge Roe,'' Greenwood said. ``On theother hand, I think it is inevitable that the Supreme Court will,in one way or another, rule on all these matters. It's just amatter of time.''</TEXT></DOC>
