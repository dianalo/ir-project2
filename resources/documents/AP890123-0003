Supercomputers are used by the government, the military,universities and Fortune 500 companies to help crack codes, forecastweather, design aircraft, conduct geological exploration or simulatethe effects of nuclear explosions.   ``The supercomputer is important economically and socially,''said Peter Patton, a computer consultant in Minnesota. ``They'reused in everything from the mundane to the sublime _ designingappliances ... to developing new life-saving techniques andsurgery.''   That range, he said, can help shape America's role in the worldeconomy.   ``The whole name of the game is competitive advantage in theinternational market,'' said Patton, director of technologyassessment at the Super Performance Computing Service of DataquestInc., a marketing-forecasting firm. ``The key to maintaining thatcompetitive advantage is faster design, reduced governmentcertification time, better testing.''   The two major U.S. supercomputer companies are Cray Research Inc.and ETA Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Control Data Corp.   Its competition: three Japanese computer giants _ Fujitsu,Hitachi and NEC.   There also are about three dozen smaller, so-called``mini-supercomputer'' companies in the United States, Patton said.   Some experts believe the Japanese are threatening America'sdominance of the industry. ``We opened a very large lead and we nolonger have that large lead,'' Patton said.   One of Japan's main advantages, he said, is it has the ``lion'sshare of semiconductor (computer chips) market. We gave up on thesemiconductor industry.''   But other experts say it's too early to talk of the Japaneseovertaking the United States.   ``Even though Cray machines use a lot of Japanese components, Idon't think it's fair to say they're ahead in any way, shape orform,'' said Michael Burwen, president of Palo Alto ManagementGroup, a consulting firm.   ``There are a lot of people who say the Japanese are a very bigthreat to supercomputers,'' he said. ``I don't think the evidence isin. The Japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate theycan penetrate anything outside their home market in this business.''   About 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide. U.S.customers include NASA, the National Cancer Institute and Los AlamosNational Laboratory, location of the first Cray, introduced in 1976.   Supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second.   For example, a Bible concordance _ an alphabetical referencing byword _ that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid-1700s andrequired 1,000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a Craysupercomputer in 20 seconds, Patton said.   Although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is,it generally is described as the fastest, largest, most expensivemachine at any time _ one that can do problems others can't.   Burwen also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in privateindustry, 37 percent in government installations, and 19 percent inuniversities.   Nowadays, supercomputers are changing industry, because products``can not only be designed and prototyped on screen, but be testedand evaluated ... and have complete data performance before youtouch tool to steel,'' he said.   Automakers, for one, ``can do a design in six months instead of18 months,'' he said. ``You can literally take years off the designcycle.''   Supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing forautos.   And oil companies use supercomputers to get the best productionin petroleum exploration.   ``If they get 1 percent (more oil) out of a reservoir, it paysfor itself 100 times over,'' Patton said. ``What if it's a $10million computer if you get $20 billion (more oil) out of areservoir?''   Among Cray's customers are America's Big Three automakers,Volkswagen, Fiat and petroleum giants such as Shell and Chevron.   A Cray supercomputer also was used to help design Stars andamp;Stripes, the yacht Dennis Conner sailed in 1987 when he won theAmerica's Cup. Two competing syndicates also used Cray technology,said company spokesman John Swenson.   Scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industryconstantly trying to produce faster machines.   Cray plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next,and it's expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine.In 1992-94, he hopes to produce the Cray-4, 1,000 times morepowerful.   And, Swenson said, that won't be the end. As he explained, ``Westill don't see the limit.''</TEXT></DOC>
