YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/06/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board proposed a rule that would allow it to set minimum capital requirements for federally insured savings and loan associations on a case-by-case basis.    The Bank Board also proposed a new rule allowing troubled thrifts in economically pressed regions to remain open, in some cases even when they drop below minimum requirements. This step was mandated by the comprehensive banking bill that President Reagan signed into law in August.    Beginning last Jan. 1, the Bank Board began phasing in a new regulation that raised capital requirements for all thrifts to 6% of liabilities from 3%. Under the rule proposed yesterday, the Bank Board would be able to set higher minimum capital requirements for individual thrifts that, for example, have experienced rapid growth, have a history of poor loan underwriting, or have loan portfolios with a high degree of interest-rate sensitivity.    The proposed rule reflects a switch by the Bank Board under Chairman M. Danny Wall from issuing strict, across-the-board regulations for all institutions to an approach that targets individual thrifts for close supervision. Mr. Wall became Bank Board chairman July 1.    The new rule covering thrifts in economically troubled areas would permit an institution whose capital drops below the required minimum to continue operating, as long as the institution's problems are deemed to be the result of regional economic problems and not mismanagement.    The influential U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's predominant trade group, pressed for this provision in the banking bill. The group feared that regulators would move too aggressively, closing not only thrifts that were beyond hope but those that could work themselves out of trouble if given sufficient time.    Both proposals are subject to a 30-day period for public comment, beginning with their publication in the Federal Register. </TEXT></DOC>
