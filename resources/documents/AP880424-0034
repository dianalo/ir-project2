The Communist Party daily said engineering jobs at the plantwere handed out to medics, teachers, veterinarians and peoplewithout any higher education.   It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to ``resolve atany cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant``to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance ofextremely intricate equipment.''   The scathing attack was a departure from the numerous articlesappearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary of theApril 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the power plant 80 milesnorth of the Ukrainian capital of Kiev.   The explosion killed 31 people, spewed radiation around theworld and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living near theplant.   The previous stories have stressed the extensive safetyequipment installed at the plant, improved worker training, thedecrease to safe levels of radiation and the return of people tosurrounding areas.   Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant andthe production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity theresince the accident.   But then the focus turned to criticism by the Kiev region'sCommunist Party committee of ``Kombinat,'' the organizationsupervising the plant and cleanup around it.   Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors andwas not tested before being put into service despite seriousdefects, the newspaper said. It said other problems caused ``thegrossest violations of sanitary standards.''   Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plantwere not carried out because of Kombinat's negligence, Pravda said.That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed inconcrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports havestressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized.   ``Leadership posts were given to people who had criminalrecords, who had been excluded from the party or had receivedstrict party penalties,'' Pravda said.   ``Units were headed by people not able to cope with the businessthey were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians andpeople not having any higher education were working in engineeringposts,'' Pravda said.   Discipline was slack, the newspaper said.   ``In the `Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery andviolations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said.   Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken,other than to report that Kiev party leaders reprimanded Kombinat'shead, and indicated he had been fired.   ``E. Ignatenko displayed liberalism and political immaturity inthe evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations oforganizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism,moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said.   The party leaders also reprimanded the Chernobyl plant'sdirector.   ``Judging from all this, the leadership of Kombinat has notlearned a lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. ``It's as thoughthere hasn't been an accident.''   The article indicated that managers tolerated the shortcomingsbecause of a widespread problem in Soviet industry: pressure tofulfill a production plan.   The government has said it must increase the production ofnuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. TheChernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, hasbeen ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year.   Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. V.Lukyanenko, the Communist Party head in Slavutich, a new town forplant workers near Chernobyl, told a newspaper that sloppy work,poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal.   Yuri K. Semyonov, deputy head of the Chernobyl cleanupcommission, denied at a Moscow news conference Wednesday that anymajor accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986explosion.</TEXT></DOC>
