Pentagon sources saidsophisticated U.S. missiles capable of knocking out Iraqi tanks andaircraft had been deployed in Saudi Arabia.   The administration said the economic quarantine of Iraq wasbiting hard, and expressed ``significant optimism'' now that Arabtroops were joining American forces in the armed defense of SaudiArabia.   The administration said it was encouraged that 11 Americans,including 10-year-old Penelope Nabokov, were allowed to leave Iraqovernight. Yet, an estimated 3,800 Americans remain in Iraq andKuwait, prevented from leaving.   ``We think it would be a mistake to characterize it as a hostagesituation and to use a word like that since we are in discussion(with Iraq) with respect to the matter,'' Secretary of State JamesA. Baker III said. He said there was no indication any Americanshave been mistreated.   From his vacation home on the coast of Maine, Bush turned up theheat on Saddam, a day after the Iraqi leader declared a ``holywar'' against countries uniting against his invasion of Kuwait.Bush consulted Arab leaders on the growing multinational militarybuildup in the Saudi desert.   Bush said the United States was not prepared to support Saddam'souster but said that ``some countries around the world are hopingthat that will happen.'' He said such an ouster ``sometimes happenswhen leaders get so out of touch with reality that they committheir country to outrageous acts.''   The military buildup grew in the Persian Gulf and their werefresh indications that a naval blockade was being readied againstIraqi commerce.   Up to 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to take up positions inSaudi Arabia in the coming weeks, and Pentagon sources saycontingency plans call for as many as 250,000 to be sent if Iraqmakes a military move into Saudi Arabia.   In Riyadh, diplomatic sources said Saudi Arabian anti-aircraftbatteries on Saturday fired at two Iraqi reconnaissance planes nearthe border with Kuwait. They said the planes turned back withoutcrossing the border.   Pentagon sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidPatriot ground-to-air missiles were earmarked for deployment inSaudi Arabia, and that U.S. Stinger shoulder-fired guided missilesalready had arrived in the kingdom as the United States preparesfor a possible Iraqi invasion.   Other anti-aircraft missiles to be deployed include theChaparral, a supersonic mobile heat-seeking missile that is capableof knocking out aircraft and helicopters at low altitude, thesources said.   While praising the success of sanctions to enforce a UnitedNations trade embargo against Iraq, the White House said that``planning for a blockade is underway, should it be necessary.''   Bush said, ``The good news is that no shipping from Iraq iscoming through the Straits of Hormuz,'' and added that the UnitedStates was working with other naval forces in the region ``to besure that no oil goes out but we aren't prepared to announceanything more than that.''   Asked about a blockade, Bush said, ``I've made the decision inprinciple and I think most other leaders have that the sanctionswill be fully enforced and that exports from Iraq will not get intothe market.''   ``Right now the United Nations sanctions are being widelyimplemented and there is no Iraqi oil leaving Turkey or SaudiArabia,'' said Marlin Fitzwater, the president's spokesman.Pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey are the primary outletsfor carrying Iraq's oil.   ``The embargo appears to be having considerable effect,''Fitzwater added.   Fitzwater said the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad was ``in contactalmost hourly with Iraqi officials concerning the safety'' of the3,800 Americans in Kuwait and Iraq.   Bush met with Baker and other top advisers to reviewdevelopments. Later, in a news conference, Bush was asked whetherhe would support the ouster of Saddam.   ``We're not prepared to support the overthrow but I hope thatthese actions that have been taken will result in an Iraq that isprepared to live peacefully in a community of nations,'' Bush said.``And if that means Saddam Hussein changes his spots, so be it. Andif he doesn't, I hope the Iraqi people do something about it sothat their leader will live by the norms of international behaviorthat will be acceptable to other nations.''   On the first full day of a 25-day vacation, Bush found time forleisure time activity, too. Despite a driving rain, he went outduring the morning on his racing boat, Fidelity. He also playedgolf in the rain.   He was up early to press diplomatic efforts by phone. At 5:45a.m., the president called Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak andcongratulated him on the Arab summit meeting, which decided Fridayto send Arab troops to Saudi Arabia.   Bush also called King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and the emirs ofBahrain and Qatar.   ``I think things are moving in the right direction,'' Bush toldreporters. ``We're pleased so far with the solidarity,cohesiveness, of the economic actions that have been taken.''   Bush said Saddam was increasingly isolated, as demonstrated bythe Arab summit's commitment of troops to Saudi Arabia. Bush saidthat was a promising development in view of Saddam's ``outrageousrhetoric and outrageous military action against Kuwait.''   Bush said he hoped that economic sanctions would deter Saddam.   He said the United States and other nations must prove theirwillingness ``to tell Saddam Hussein that aggression will not besuccessful and that friends will be protected.''   Asked if forces in Iraq might rise up against Saddam, Bushreplied,   ``I know that some countries around the world hope that'llhappen in this situation, but we'll have to wait and see,'' Bushsaid. ``My feeling is that whatever it takes to have our objectivesmet is what should take place.''   The president noted differences with Jordan's King Hussein, whocame to Saddam's defense after his forces invaded Kuwait.   Bush said the Jordanian monarch ``has been a friend of theUnited States for a long time and I'd like to see that friendshipbe reinstated or be reinvigorated in the future.'' He said Hussein,whose country borders Iraq, was ``in a difficult position.''   On a related front, Bush said it appeared that oil prices weremoderating after sharp increased.   ``We are using every diplomatic channel we can to be sure thatthere are no shortages and there is no gouging and there isn't someprofit windfall made by _ out of these most unfortunate events.''</TEXT></DOC>
