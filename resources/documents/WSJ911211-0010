LBI also has the problem that its name is almost identicalto Bishopsgate Investment Management and London andamp; BishopsgateInternational Investment Management PLC. Both companies arebeing investigated by Britain's Serious Fraud Office forpossible involvement in improperly shifting about 427 millionpounds ($772.9 million) of assets from pension funds atMirror Group Newspapers PLC and Maxwell Communication Corp.to other areas of the late Mr. Maxwell's business.   Andrew P. Smith, executive vice chairman and chiefinvestment officer of LBI, said: &quot;From a personnel point ofview, a capital point of view and from an operational pointof view, there is no crossover&quot; between the two British fundmanagers and the U.S. money management. He added that LBIhadn't been contacted by the Serious Fraud Office and didn'tmanage any British pension assets of the Maxwell Group. LBIdoes manage some of the group's U.S. pension assets, but theyamount to just 3% of LBI's total assets.   Phoebe B. Zaslove, LBI's president and chief executiveofficer said, &quot;We've been trying to get Robert Maxwell tosell his stake for a year.&quot; Since August, when Mr. Maxwellagreed to allow LBI to seek new partners, executives havebeen talking to new investors. Ms. Zaslove added that therecent scandal made the need to split with the family &quot;evenmore imperative.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
