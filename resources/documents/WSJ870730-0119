Their haul includes fall shoes in suede and snakeskin, an emerald and magenta silk outfit, a soft black leather purse marked down to $90 from twice that much and some on-sale Easter bunnies for the kids.    None of which the Nashville, Tenn., family really needs, especially after the vacation shopping the Jacksons did on earlier summer trips to Memphis and to Orlando, Fla. &quot;I get total fulfillment from it,&quot; says Norma Jackson, a Nashville schoolteacher, in trying to explain the family's binge. Adds Mr. Jackson, an assistant school principal: &quot;Shopping is like a drug. It's a temporary high.&quot;    The Jacksons may sound a bit compulsive. But every day, an estimated 50,000 energetic, indefatigable shoppers descend -- sometimes by the busload -- on Lenox Square, one of Atlanta's hottest shopping spots. And many of them are like the Jacksons: They don't really need what they are shopping for. Often they don't even know what they're after. Some buy things they never wear or rarely use; many buy and then return what they bought, then buy again and return that.    Shoppers' behavior has been a major driving force for the economy and has made shopping, arguably, the nation's favorite pastime next to television-watching. Adults (both women and men) average about six hours weekly on shopping for everything. It is impossible to tell what is drudgery and what is pleasure; but according to a study by John Robinson, a sociology professor at the University of Maryland, the time spent shopping is way more than the hour adults spend gardening or reading books, the 10 minutes or less they spend on golf or the 40 minutes spent playing with children.    For some time now, this shopping boom has flown in the face of demographic and economic logic. The archetypal shopper -- the female -- has gone to work and presumably has more important things to do. Everybody, it seems, is strapped for time. And catalog and home-shopping services offer the convenience that consumers say they so badly want.    Beyond that, who can afford it? While a boon for the economy, this spending spree has helped propel consumer debt to staggering levels and pushed the savings rate to just as shocking lows. In the last month, economists have been saying yet again that they believe consumers are tightening their belts. But earlier this week, the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending had surged in June, once again defying their predictions.    Economists, many of them amazed at consumers' freewheeling ways, wonder what has kept them going for so long and periodically predict they will exhaust themselves and collapse under the weight of their credit lines. But even if they do slow down, few expect that this year, anyway, they will do anything as dire as save their money or stay home Saturday afternoons.    Shopping has taken on a life of its own. It has attained a pop-culture status that has spawned such bumper stickers as: &quot;I shop, therefore I am&quot; and &quot;Born to Shop.&quot; &quot;It is a lot more than simply providing for necessary things,&quot; says Joseph Smith, a psychologist and president of the New York consulting firm Oxtoby-Smith Inc. &quot;It is obviously fulfilling many needs -- a lot of people don't like to confess that.&quot;    It is also raising some serious questions. &quot;People are going into debt in incredible levels without making rational decisions about how and why they are spending money,&quot; says Robert Cialdini, a psychologist who teaches at Arizona State University. &quot;There is a kind of mindless character to it.&quot; While truly compulsive shoppers are a small minority, the number of those who have problems controlling their impulse to buy &quot;is much, much larger,&quot; says Thomas O'Guinn, advertising professor at the University of Illinois. He adds: &quot;I would term it a national problem.&quot;    A number of recent studies present the following picture of American shoppers: About 70% of all adults visit a regional mall weekly. Most shop at neighborhood shopping centers twice a week. On the average, everybody grocery-shops at least twice a week.    The shopping epidemic can't be explained away just by spendthrift yuppies or the &quot;me generation.&quot; It has infected everybody. More men are shopping -- making up about one-third of the adult mall crowd this year in one survey -- up from one-quarter in 1981. And judging from the latest generation of shoppers, their numbers are likely to increase. &quot;Teen-age males are becoming extremely fashion-conscious,&quot; says Peter Zollo, executive vice president of Teenage Research Unlimited in Lake Forest, Ill., pointing out that 27% don designer jeans and 23% use hair-styling mousse.    For teens, both the time spent shopping (two hours for boys and four hours for girls) and the enjoyment of the pastime are increasing rapidly, Mr. Zollo says. Even the elderly -- with memories of the Depression fading -- are getting looser with their spare change. Shopping has become a favorite of vacationers. And what time-starved working women want even more than extra hours in the day, one study says, is longer shopping hours.    Increasingly, purchases are linked less and less closely to need. &quot;We're not talking ironing boards that have worn out,&quot; says Isaac Lagnado, the director of research for Associated Merchandising Corp., a merchandising-consulting firm. &quot;You're talking replacement just for the sake of change. People are buying new sheets not because the old ones wore out but because they're stimulated by a new set of plaid ones.&quot; Long true of apparel, the trend is rapidly spreading to other areas. Six years ago, all but one-quarter to one-third of all houseware purchases were to replace items that had worn out. Today, less than half are replacements.    A tremendous amount of buying is done on impulse. About 53% of groceries and 47% of hardware-store buys are spur of the moment, studies say. When Stillerman Jones andamp; Co., a marketing-research firm, asked 34,300 mall shoppers across the country the primary reason for their visit, only 25% had come in pursuit of a specific item.    So why, then, do so many people spend so much time shopping? The reasons are many, varied and complex. According to shoppers and those who observe them, shopping can be all things to all people. It can alleviate loneliness and dispel boredom; it can be a sport and can be imbued with the thrill of the hunt; it can provide escape, fulfill fantasies, relieve depression. A closer look at some of these categories follows.    Alleviating Loneliness: For a lot of people, &quot;shopping appears to be a substitute for a relationship,&quot; says Jack Lesser, a marketing professor at Miami University in Ohio, who has found the most avid shoppers are the single, the widowed and the divorced. Kathryn Roth, an art professor swinging through Lenox Square on a recent lunch hour, says she is most prone to shop during evenings &quot;when I don't have anything to do and don't have anybody to talk to. I go to the mall and look at the people.&quot; And, she says with a sigh, &quot;I can spend it, and I don't have to tell anybody.&quot;    Dispelling Boredom: Shopping is tailor-made for a video generation that thrives on bright colors and visual distractions. &quot;I shop when I'm feeling bored or when I feel like I need something new,&quot; says Brad Vroon, a 19-year-old Emory University student. &quot;If you look in my closet, you'll say I don't need anything. But I get sick of things after a couple of months.&quot; Often he buys things and returns them.    Shopping as a Sport: At Finale on Five, the discount paradise of Rich's downtown department store, the shoppers who cull through tangles of 90%-off belts and racks of half-price evening dresses are committed to beating the system. &quot;To me, shopping is like playing baseball,&quot; says Debra Weston, who has snatched up so many prospective purchases that she is sitting cross-legged on the floor, trying to sort them out. Today's homer: 14 pairs of designer socks for $13, marked down from $50. &quot;I spend a lot of time eyeballing, and I love to find something cheaper at another store,&quot; she says.    At some point, though, one wonders who is beating whom. Last year, Carol Duhart went broke bargain-shopping at Finale on Five. She paid off her debt and is back. &quot;This place is like a magnet,&quot; says the federal employee. &quot;It has a weird effect on me.&quot;    Spoils of the Hunt: Mr. Smith, the consultant, believes shopping may be the modern manifestation of more primitive roles. He explains: &quot;Man, the provider, the big daddy, may not be able to bring home a mastodon, but he can sure bring home a VCR or a computer.&quot;    Shopping as an Escape: Holly Tappen, like many working women at times, considers shopping a pleasant, mind-numbing narcotic. &quot;It's a little vacation from your daily tasks,&quot; says the travel consultant. &quot;It is absolutely mindless behavior.&quot;    In focus groups, &quot;I'm hearing {working} women more and more say, 'I can go into this home-decorating store and it's therapy. I can go into a trance,'&quot; says Bill Huckabee, the president of C.W. Ress andamp; Associates Inc., a Columbus, Ohio, retail consulting firm.    Fantasy Fulfillment: The malls are brimming with the fantastic, but perhaps the most dramatic example is Banana Republic, a unit of Gap Inc. It beckons across Lenox Square like Bali Ha'i with a thatched roof, door handles made out of ivory (presumably) tusks and catalogs piled on crates marked &quot;Chad&quot; and &quot;the Congo&quot; that are filled with pictures of anywhere but here. It lures even the unlikeliest of passers-by. Gail Thiessen, an art professor, prides herself on being a practical shopper and a real stickler for necessities and bargains. But even she admits a weakness for Banana Republic. &quot;I think it appeals to the adventuresome soul in everybody,&quot; she says.    Although Brad Clevenger visits Atlanta's Perimeter Mall twice weekly, he actually only buys something about once a month. The rest of the time, he fantasizes. &quot;I usually come to get something to eat,&quot; says the 18-year-old data processor, &quot;and then I look for what I can get -- what I'd like to have in the future, what I can look forward to. It gives me a goal, something to save my money for.&quot;    Relieving Depression: &quot;Just the thought of going shopping makes me feel better,&quot; says Mrs. Jackson, the Nashville teacher. &quot;I think about the clothes, the colors. It may not feel better in the long run, but it takes my mind off my problems.&quot;    At Rich's, Linda Smith searches for flaws in a green cocktail dress she is holding up to the light. &quot;Shopping makes me feel better when I'm depressed and not feeling too good,&quot; says the finance-company manager. &quot;It's a state of mind, I guess. I don't know why it makes me feel better.&quot;    Shopping is no longer isolated to clearly defined districts. Lenox Square, with its 200-odd stores and shops, could be an entire city all by itself. Instead, it is merely one of 347 shopping centers in the Atlanta area. In one Kroger supermarket, a budget-minded shopper must resist not only gourmet cheeses and pasta but also perfume, television sets and sushi. A local Lechmere store offers not one, not 10 but 32 different personal stereos with headphones, 24 different hair dryers and 16 irons.    The mass media clearly have done a lot to whip up this shopping orgy, says Mr. O'Guinn, the advertising professor, noting that many TV shows portray a life of opulence. &quot;Even if you don't believe life is really like that, you sort of operate as if it were,&quot; Mr. O'Guinn says. Advertisements have fueled the increasing tendency of consumers to value objects for what they stand for instead of what they can do. Speaking hypothetically, Mr. O'Guinn says, &quot;I buy a Mercedes not because it is a fine piece of German engineering, but because I value it as a symbol of my success.&quot;    Consumers, though craftier bargain-hunters than they used to be, are nonetheless susceptible to spending if the right buttons are pushed. One recent study indicates, for instance, that they have developed an almost Pavlovian response to credit cards. When asked how much they would pay for an item like a toaster, the participants were consistently bigger spenders when a credit card was pictured nearby (as it is on many cash registers). They would spend $67.33 for the toaster, for instance, three times as much as when credit cards weren't in sight. They were also bigger tippers and more generous charity donors when they saw pictures of credit cards, says Richard A. Feinberg, the Purdue University consumer-sciences and retailing professor who conducted the study.    Mr. O'Guinn worries that consumers are caught in a &quot;hedonic trap&quot; -- an ever-spiraling and hopeless search for happiness through the acquisition of things. With each purchase, &quot;your expectations are never quite fulfilled, so you say, 'I'll just buy this one more thing,'&quot; he says.    Mr. Cialdini, the psychologist, believes that consumers are resorting increasingly to what he calls &quot;click-whir&quot; behavior. Life has become so complex that consumers can't possibly analyze the merits of all of their decisions, he says. So they are more susceptible to certain cues and symbols like &quot;discount&quot; or &quot;last day sale&quot; and take less time to analyze fundamental questions like need or cost. &quot;When we react to symbols instead of to information, then what we do doesn't make sense anymore,&quot; he says.    Some shoppers doubt their own behavior. &quot;I really think that the time can be better spent in conversation, writing, painting, reading,&quot; says Ms. Tappen, the travel consultant. Says Mr. Vroon, the Emory student: &quot;I don't think all this materialism is so good. It's probably good for the economy, but not real good for people's minds.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
