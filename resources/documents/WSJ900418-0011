It isn't that some chief executive salaries rival those ofballplayers or rock stars, or that golden parachutesproliferate. It isn't that stock options can deliver more paythan a middle manager will earn in a lifetime. And it isn'tsimply that their own pay raises seem paltry.</LP><TEXT>   What really makes middle managers mad is unfairness.   Listen to this vice president and financial analyst at amajor bank: &quot;It disturbs me when someone on high dictatesthat no matter how hard you work or what you do, you're onlygoing to get a 6% increase, and if you don't like it, you cantake a hike. Yet whatever they've negotiated for themselves-- 10% or 20% or 30% -- is a different issue from the rest ofthe staff.&quot; Adds Joe, a manager at Sterling Drugs Inc.: &quot;It'screating a gap between those who do and those who have.&quot;   That same bitterness surfaces repeatedly here in a paneldiscussion with a group of middle managers. Ask them aboutwhat their CEO makes, and most profess not to even know -- orcare. Ask them about their own pay, and they don't seemparticular bothered by the level. But ask them about howtheir pay raises are set or how they compare to the raises oftheir bosses, and they start talking about inequities,sinking morale and the decline of worker loyalty.   Arranged for The Wall Street Journal by Decision ResearchCorp., a marketing-research company, the group consisted ofeight middle managers. Each manager works at a large publiclytraded industrial or service company and has between threeand 40 subordinates. The managers' average tenure is sevenyears. Their own compensation ranges from $50,000 to $100,000a year. And -- not surprisingly -- they agreed to speak oncondition that only their first names or titles be used.   Their responses are not meant to be scientifically valid.But the uniformity of their responses is striking. And theircomplaints are those that are echoed repeatedly throughoutthe ranks of middle management.   In principle, most don't find chief executive payupsetting. &quot;Our CEO is active and involved,&quot; says aninformation-systems manager at American Cyanamid Co. &quot;I don'tthink {millions} is too much. I wouldn't take that job withall its pressure and stress.&quot;   Indeed, many feel their leaders even deserve to earn agreat deal more than do middle managers: &quot;There's more of methan there are of them,&quot; says a manager at Liz Claiborne Inc.The senior managers at Claiborne, she says, &quot;work harder thaneverybody else, and they're making this company what it is.&quot;Do they really need all that money? &quot;I don't think they needit,&quot; she says. &quot;I think they earned it.&quot;   These middle managers had no problems with CEO pay hittingeven stratospheric levels. Should there be a ceiling put ontop executive pay? they are asked. &quot;Is there a ceiling onperformance?&quot; responds a media supervisor at a Saatchi andamp;Saatchi advertising agency.   But for all the talk about pay for performance these days,most of the group feel they see the opposite only too often.Many suspect, for instance, that their superiors aren't abovetampering with pay-for-performance formulas when it suitsthem -- &quot;bingo bookkeeping,&quot; says Joe, the Sterling Drugmanager. &quot;When they don't get the 10% earnings increase, theysay, `OK, it's not my fault we didn't make money, it'ssomebody else's fault. Next year maybe we'll do better, butif we don't, that won't be my fault, either. But if we makemoney, I'm the guy that did it.'&quot;   Indeed, they object even when it benefits them. Amarketing manager at Avon Products Inc., thinks that onerecent year's bonus pool for managers was inflated by specialitems &quot;that shouldn't have been included in the profits, sothey're paying for non-performance and they shouldn't dothat. I don't think they are spending their money well.&quot;However, she adds: &quot;Nobody turned their checks back.&quot;   As managers, they also worry about those who report tothem. Caps on raises don't allow for rewarding extraordinaryperformance. But somehow these managers have to explain totheir subordinates why the pay of lower-level workers isallowed only to inch up, while the pay of the boss canskyrocket.   &quot;One of the things that really frustrates me and a numberof my peers is that I work for a company that prides itselfin paying and compensating people on an {industry average},&quot;says the American Cyanamid manager. &quot;That's not something Inecessarily think is great to strive for. But we also had achairman and CEO who was {among the highest paid in theindustry} in 1988. So I have people killing themselves --actually making a difference on the corporate bottom line --and the best I can do for them is 8%.&quot;   The manager of the Saatchi unit expresses similarfrustration with raising subordinates' pay. &quot;I have23-year-olds making multimillion-dollar decisions who aremaking $17,000 a year,&quot; he says. &quot;We have exit interviews{that show} our company drives people out because they won'tgive them decent salaries.&quot;   It's a common problem. A survey by the Hay Group showedthat on the average, satisfactory performers received 4.7%increases while outstanding performers received 7.7%increases. For a $40,000-a-year worker, that would work outto about a $17-a-week after-tax difference. &quot;Hardly enough topush someone to excel,&quot; says Ira Kay, senior vice presidentand managing director of compensation consulting at Hay.   For some middle managers, though, such a compensationstrategy reflects a deeper, more troubling attitude on thepart of companies. That is, that compensation isn't seen as amotivational tool but rather as just another businessexpense.   &quot;They're looking at it this way,&quot; says Sterling Drug'sJoe. &quot;We get a body, put it in this spot, give it some money,and then when it gets too expensive, get rid of it and getanother body {at a lower cost} and put him in the spot.&quot;Agrees the Saatchi unit manager: &quot;Most of them are treatingpeople like just a cost of operations.&quot;   The solution these middle managers would prefer: a systemof rewards based on team and individual performance thatallows for extraordinary bonuses. They want to be paid moredirectly for their performance in meeting goals -- paid out,though, over a longer term so that workers don't have anincentive to inflate short-term results. And they want theirbosses to be paid similarly.   &quot;I feel pretty good about it,&quot; says a customer-servicemanager for a large public utility, which has such a system.&quot;You all have shared goals. There's a different amount atrisk in each package, so you really incent people to doexceptional work, and not reward people for just hanging on.&quot;   Such a shared system, they believe, would help them workmore effectively. &quot;After working in a company where people doshare the same goals and it is a total team effort, I don'twant to go to work for just anybody else because of a betterpackage or anything they are going to offer to try to lureme,&quot; says the Claiborne manager. &quot;It has to be the kind ofcompany I want to work for.&quot; Agrees the Avon manager: &quot;I'mgetting back to more traditional values. If you are workingwith people that have similar values, it's more likely thatyou will be able to work effectively with them.&quot;   It would also assuage another one of their concerns: peersand immediate supervisors who don't earn their keep. &quot;I seemy boss -- I think I work harder than he does,&quot; says a vicepresident of Chemical Banking Corp. &quot;He's a regional managerand all he does is review my work. And I think he worksharder than his boss. I honestly think that compensationisn't tied to your performance or your effort at all. Really,it's the rank and file that does all the work, and they'renot compensated accordingly. It stinks.&quot;   That's been particularly true, these managers say, inrecent years, as companies have thinned the ranks of middlemanagement -- and yet haven't reduced the burden. As themanager of the Saatchi unit says: &quot;I've noticed that myworkload and responsibilities have increased more than mysalary.&quot;   But most aren't sanguine about solving the problem anytime soon. The bank financial analyst notes that her companyhas recently canceled its profit-sharing plan and that only&quot;deal doers&quot; get bonuses nowadays.   Many of them, however, report having used a time-honoredmethod of increasing their own pay. &quot;Three years ago, I wasgrossly underpaid, so I quit. A year later I came back with a50% increase in salary,&quot; says the Chemical Bank vicepresident. Simply threatening to quit worked for the LizClaiborne manager. Adds the manager of the Saatchi unit:&quot;It's a standard technique.&quot; The problem is, he reckons: &quot;Youhave to be ready to go.&quot;   ---   Ms. Bennett, a senior special writer in The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau, served as contributing editor ofthis Wall Street Journal Report.   ---                       Keeping Pace                                                                                                          Percentage by which changes in cash compensation forvarious occupations exceeded or trailed changes in theconsumer price index                                                                                                                                          Over past    Over past                                   five years   10 years                                                                                                          Personnel manager                  15%          13%   Chief executive officer    (large company)                   12           13   Board member    (non-durable goods company)        9            8   Executive secretary                 7            8   Computer operator                   7            7   Systems analyst                     5            5   Board member    (durable-goods company)            2            3   Cost-accounting manager             1            0   Internal auditor                    1           -1   Plant manager                       0           -4   Chief executive officer    (medium-sized company)             0           -4   Chief financial officer    (large company)                   -3           -5   Market-research manager            -4           -7   Chief financial officer    (medium-sized company)            -7           -8   Customer-service manager          -10          -11                                                                                                          Source: The Wyatt Group, 1989</TEXT></DOC>
