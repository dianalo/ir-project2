The average molecularweight (determined by vapour pressure osomometer) of 10 arbitrary fractionsobtained by this fractionation technique ranged from 228 to 2074. Usingan analytical GPC equipped with Shodex columns (divinyl benzene polymer)a linear relationship was found between the logarithm of the molecularweight of fractions and retention volumes. Elemental analysis of thefractions showed an increase in nitrogen and sulphur contents as a functionof molecular weight. H/C atomic ratios increased with decreased molecularweight and peaked at 648 g/mole. Conversely, aromaticity decreased sharplyto a minimum at 548 g/mole and then increased gradually as molecularweight increased. 27 refs., 10 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
