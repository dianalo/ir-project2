LOUIS -- General Dynamics Corp. said it would seek torevamp a controversial executive compensation plan, which sofar this year has provided some $20 million in bonuses forthe company's top 25 executives.   The defense contractor said the modifications would &quot;moreclosely align management and employee interests with those ofoutside shareholders.&quot; The adjustments would also mean more&quot;downside risk&quot; for the executives, while increasing the&quot;emphasis on long-term results.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The current plan grants credits equal to double anexecutive's base salary every time the company's stock climbs10 points and stays there for 10 trading days. The proposedchanges would substitute that setup with a more traditionalstock-option arrangement.   General Dynamics said it would soon set a date for aspecial shareholders meeting to approve the alterations --the first step of which would actually be to award executiveswith a final, albeit partial, bonus.   The company praises its various incentive programs forplaying &quot;a critical role in motivating employees at alllevels&quot; to focus more &quot;on profitability, financial strengthand improving shareholder value.&quot; Indeed, General Dynamicsthis year has lifted earnings, raised worker productivity andgenerated strong cash flow. Since January, its stock pricehas more than doubled.</TEXT></DOC>
