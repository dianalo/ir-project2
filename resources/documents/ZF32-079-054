 This fall,at least three other companies plan to introduce microprocessors or chip setsthat are compatible with 386 software.andP;  This is going to dramaticallycomplicate the PC microprocessor business, raising a host of compatibilityquestions and legal issues.andP;  One big question is how Intel will respond.andM;AMD has been awble to enter the 386 business earlier than other companies byvirtue of its license to Intel patents (which is not disputed) and itsclaimed license to use Intel's microcode copyrights (which is the subject ofa lawsuit scheduled for trial this fall).andP;  Because of the closeness of AMD'sdesign to Intel's, there have been no compatibility issues.andP;  The legal issuesbetween Intel and AMD are essentially contract disputes, so the morefundamental issues of whether 386-compatible processors are legally possiblehave not been addressed.andM;Intel's physical chip design is protected by its mask copyright.andP;  This shouldnot be an issue for other 386-compatible designs, since no company is likelyto be so bold as to directly copy Intel's chip layout.andP;  Microcode isprotected by software copyrights, but clean-room microcode development caneliminate this as an issue.andM;The big issue is not copyrights, but patents.andP;  Intel has several patents onvarious aspects of the 286 and 386 architecture.andP;  Experts disagree on whetherit is possible to build an object-code-compatible microprocessor that doesn'tinfringe any of these patents.andP;  Intel and compatible processor makers arelikely to have different views of what constitutes patent infringement.andM;If Intel chooses to sue every maker of 386-software-compatiblemicroprocessors for patent infringement, it could cripple their sales--atleast until the litigation were settled, which could be well past the usefullife-times of the chips.andP;  From a corporate viewpoint, this strategy must bequite appealing to Intel, since it would slow the emergence of competitiveproducts.andP;  Intel's huge bankroll enables it to invest far more in litigationthan most competitors could spend in defense.andP;  Given Intel's past actions,this seems to be a likely strategy.andM;Intel has the option, however, to take a different path, which would be farbetter for the computer industry and may be better for Intel as well in thelong run.andP;  By offering to license its 386-related patents on reasonable termsto all applicants, Intel could elevate the 386 architecture to an open,industry standard.andP;  Nothing need be given away--just licensed.andP;  Not onlywould Intel eliminate tens of millions of dollars in possible legal costs,but it would gain an income stream from royalties and help overcome itsreputation as an industry bully.andP;  This approach would also reduce the chancethat a compatible processor maker would challenge Intel's patents and succeedin invalidating them, which would then deprive Intel of any royalty revenue.andO;With a vigorous, multivendor environment, the 386 architecture would giveless ground to the onslaught of RISC microprocessors.andP;  Intel is likely toremain the dominant supplier regardless, even with several directcompetitors.andM;Intel, of course, talks of the need to protect its intellectual property toget a fair return on its Randamp;D, and thereby fund the next generation ofdevices.andP;  Intel has already reaped enormous rewards from developing the 386,however, and its cash resources, design teams, manufacturing capability, andcustomer relationships will give it an enormous edge in the marketplace, evenwithout any patent protection.andM;It is not as if the 386-related patents are protecting fundamentalbreakthroughs that have been the cause of Intel's success.andP;  The patents areon design details that build closely upon earlier processor designs, and thepatented features are not the basis of the 386's success--or even its bestfeatures.andM;The tremendous success of the 386 architecture and its continued strength inthe face of dozens of (incompatible) competitors are due to the enormous baseof third-party application software.andP;  Intel has been able to sellmicroprocessors at premium prices because of the value of this software.andP;  ForIntel to maintain a 17-year monopoly on microprocessors that can execute thissoftware would be a disproportionate reward.andM;A tough, litigious stance may be in Intel's best short-term interest, but thecomputer industry and its customers would be better served if intellectualproperty rights were not allowed to get in the way of interfacestandardization.andP;  The instruction set architecture (ISA) is the software'sinterface to the processor, and any company should have the right toimplement any ISA--using its own technology, of course.andM;With the laws as they are today, however, Intel has to decide whether it willfight to the end to protect its monopoly, or allow the 386 to become a truestandard by licensing its related patents.andP;  The legal system won't changesoon (if ever), but the companies that lead the computer business can take abig step by openly licensing intellectual property that restricts the use ofstandard interfaces.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
