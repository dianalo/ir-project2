Boucek (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CANDA </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><TEXT>   The stock market crash in October ended high expectations both for Canadian share prices and for brokerage houses themselves.    Usually, the resource-based companies that dominate the Toronto Stock Exchange surge in maturing bull markets. So Toronto was expected to outshine other world markets. The Canadian market narrowly did so, but its advantage was centered on a few special sectors.    In addition, deregulation of Canada's securities industry last summer was expected to bring in a flood of foreign investment. But instead, the brokerage business came to be dominated by Canada's big domestic banks.    The Toronto exchange's broad-based 300 composite index had risen 34% from the beginning of last year to its all-time high in August of 4112.9. But the crash in late October knocked it down a third. Some of the losses were recovered in volatile trading for the rest of the year so that the composite ended 1987 at 3160.05 for a net gain on the year of only 3.1%. That was better than most other exchanges and similar to New York's 2.2%.    The slight gain in Toronto came from only a couple of strong sectors: gold mining stocks, whose Toronto exchange index surged 42% on rising bullion prices, other mining stocks, up 36%, and forest products stocks, up 19.4% on red-hot demand for newsprint. But petroleum stocks were flat and the capital goods and consumer products sectors lower. The Toronto exchange index for financial services dropped 13.7% in 1987 as Canadian banks wrote off some 3.47 billion Canadian dollars ($2.64 billion) in Third World debt.    Nevertheless, stock market investors have done extraordinarily well since this last bull market started in the summer of 1982. The Toronto market is still ahead 135% from its lows of that year with some sectors particularly high. The gold miners are up nearly five-fold, real estate stocks are up four-fold, and communications, media stocks and forestry issues are up threefold.    Heading into the crash, the stock trading business was doing very well, fueling hope that foreigners would bring fresh capital and dynamic techniques to the industry. Annual share volume and value records were reached by August and, by year end, some 7.39 billion shares valued at 100.22 billion dollars had traded in Toronto, up 51% and 57%, respectively, from a year earlier. Profits in the first nine months of 1987 for seven publicly traded brokerage houses were up 62% to 101.6 million dollars.    However, the crash quickly made the Canadian securities industry less of an imperative for foreign investors who were already chastened by their experiences with London's &quot;Big Bang.&quot; Just last week, First Chicago Corp. called off its agreement of last June to buy a 35% stake in Wood Gundy Corp. for $200 million. Wood Gundy, once the pre-eminent force in the industry, lost as much as 50 million dollars from its participation in British Petroleum Co.'s share offering last October, leading First Chicago to rethink its plans.    While there has been some foreign investment in small stockbrokers, most of the larger investment houses have fallen into the arms of Canada's big banks. Bank of Nova Scotia is displacing Shearson Lehman Brothers Group Inc. as McLeod Young Weir Ltd.'s major shareholder, Bank of Montreal bought Nesbitt Thomson Inc., Royal Bank of Canada is buying Dominion Securities Inc., and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is forming a joint venture with Gordon Capital Corp.    So far, there haven't been widespread cutbacks by stockbrokers in the wake of the crash. Dominion Securities Inc. took a charge of 26.9 million dollars to cover losses on inventory positions suffered because of the crash. Wood Gundy's problems have led to the layoff of some 150 employees.    Thus, while 1987 didn't turn out as was hoped, Canadian brokers generally appear to have survived the October debacle. The stock trading system withstood unprecedented volume and volatility and the investment community now is buoyed by the huge reserves of the big banks.    The Toronto market crash came despite a strong Canadian economy. Canada's unemployment rate is at a six-year low, gross domestic product grew at a 4.4% annual rate in the third quarter and the government's leading economic indicators have been solidly positive all year. However, a fifth of Canada's domestic output depends upon exports to the U.S., and forecasts for the Canadian economy are hedged with caveats about U.S. developments.    For 1988, many economists have scaled back slightly their estimates of Canadian economic growth. George D. Vasic, chief economist at Data Resources of Canada, said, &quot;A nervous calm has emerged since (the crash): Growth will be slower in 1988, but only moderately more so than was expected prior to Oct. 19.&quot; He has cut his estimate of Canada's 1988 economic growth to 2.5% from 2.9% before the crash.    Unlike in the U.S., the market crash didn't unleash a frantic political response in Canada. There have been no demands for reducing the federal government's budget deficit, even though it is twice the size of America's as a proportion of the economy. Indeed, since the crash, Prime Minister Mulroney's administration unveiled a national child care program to complement its already generous programs for health care, education and unemployment insurance.    Although Mr. Mulroney doesn't have to call an election until the summer of 1989, it's unusual for a government to last for its full five-year term and an election call this year is likely. The free-trade agreement with the U.S. will then be the dominant issue and further efforts to reduce the budget deficit will have to await the new regime.    As for Canadian share prices, they seldom stray too far from the trend set in New York, diverging only in some sectors. So Canadian investors face the same question as Americans: Was Oct. 19 a violent correction or the beginning of a major bear market? Toronto's composite index now is up 11.3% from its October lows, but the gain once again is the result of surging gold stocks and forest products.    ---                    Major Issues                                     Closing       Net Chg.
