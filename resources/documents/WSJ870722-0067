The decline came despite the start of a U.S. military escort of Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf.    Oil prices had risen sharply in recent weeks in anticipation that the tanker protection, among other things, would heighten tensions in the gulf, potentially leading to an attack that would disrupt petroleum supplies from the Middle East.    However, when the reflagging proceeded without incident, selling mushroomed as many traders bailed out of their long, or buying, positions.    &quot;It's the old adage: Buy the rumor, sell the fact,&quot; a trader at the New York Mercantile Exchange said.    &quot;The market has come back to reality,&quot; said Rick Donovan, head of the international energy department at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York.    There hasn't been a major altercation, and &quot;prices have gotten ahead of themselves,&quot; Mr. Donovan said.    At the New York Merc, the August crude oil contract, which expired yesterday, closed at $21.70 a barrel, down 50 cents. The more active September contract fell 41 cents a barrel to $21.47. Heating oil and gasoline futures prices fell more than one cent a gallon.    Spot, or non-contract, prices slipped as well. The spot price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, fell 50 cents a barrel to $21.70, while August North Sea Brent, an abundantly traded European blend, fell 30 cents a barrel to $20.30 in late trading.    &quot;Some people are trying to protect what they've made rather than making more profit,&quot; a trader said of the day's activity.    &quot;Once the market started to trade lower, it fed on itself,&quot; another said. Chart-guided technical factors fueled the losses, especially when prices broke below $22 a barrel, analysts said.    Trading likely will continue to be erratic for the rest of the week, some brokers and analysts said. Prices &quot;clearly won't continue to increase as they had&quot; in recent weeks, said Hutton's Mr. Donovan.    In the meantime, some analysts suggested, it is unlikely Iran would attack a U.S.-flagged tanker.    &quot;Iran is dependent on the gulf to get its own petroleum supplies to the world,&quot; said Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc. in New York.    In other futures markets yesterday:    STOCK INDEXES: Futures prices fell sharply in the afternoon amid renewed inflation fears and despite the drop in oil futures prices. Traders said rumors swept the trading pits that this morning's report on the Consumer Price Index for June may show an increase of more than twice the expected 0.3% to 0.4% climb in the closely watched inflation barometer. Treasury bond futures prices also fell on the rumors, exacerbating the decline in stock index futures prices. Traders said they also focused on Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker's testimony on Capitol Hill. Mr. Volcker sounded a shade gloomier than usual as he counseled lawmakers to fear inflation, said J.R. Fredericks, an analyst with E. David Stephens Commodity Corp. in Chicago. While Alan Greenspan, who has been nominated to replace Mr. Volcker as Fed chief, also testified, he didn't have much impact on the markets, traders said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat futures prices fell amid speculation that the Soviet Union may not need to import as much grain as expected. The speculation was sparked by a Soviet newspaper report that the country's harvest of wheat, corn and other grains could equal last year's, which totaled 210 million metric tons. A metric ton is 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The report surprised traders because earlier this month the Agriculture Department estimated that the Soviet harvest could slip to 195 million metric tons. Much of the crop was planted late due to wet and cold weather. Based on that estimate, the Agriculture Department projected that the Soviets would need to import 36 million metric tons of various grains. The Soviet newspaper report &quot;may indicate that things are more positive&quot; than orginally thought, a department officials said. The Agriculture Department issues its next estimate Aug. 11. Soybean and corn futures declined.    LIVESTOCK AND MEAT: Cattle futures prices finished lower in moderate trading. The market is in &quot;suspended animation,&quot; waiting for a cattle-on-feed report that is due this week and expected to be bearish, said Gerald Abbenhaus, an analyst at A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. Analysts estimate that the Agriculture Department's 13-state report for the second quarter, set for release after Friday's close, will show an 11% to 16% increase in the number of animals placed on feedlots, compared with a year earlier, and a 3% to 5% decline in the movement of animals to slaughter. Inventories as of July 1 are expected to be up 8% to 11%. Because the animals placed on feedlots during the second quarter should be ready for slaughter during the third and fourth quarters, contracts for fall and winter delivery lost more ground than the near-term August contract. Low feed costs -- prices are down more than 25% from the year-earlier period -- and high profitablity are a major reason for the increases that are expected, said Charles Levitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in Chicago.    COPPER: The Commodity Exchange in New York sharply increased margin requirements for buying and selling July copper contracts. The action apparently stemmed from the tightness in near-term supplies, analysts said. The exchange said its copper control committee noticed &quot;a concentration of positions&quot; in the maturing July contract, which expires next Wednesday, and acted to insure its &quot;orderly liquidation.&quot; July copper rose 1.35 cents a pound to 75.35 cents. The more active September contract was up one cent at 73.35 cents. The margin, or good faith deposit, was boosted for July contracts to $4,000 a contract from $900 for speculators and from $700 for hedgers. The action, which normally would weaken prices, instead &quot;increased the perception&quot; of tight supplies -- which has been the market's principal support -- as well as the likelihood the tightness will continue, an analyst said.    SUGAR: Futures prices fell to their lowest levels in seven months, with the October contract down 0.39 cent a pound at 6.12 cents, breaking beneath the low of 6.32 set Thursday, which was considered a major support level, analysts said. A bearish supply-and-demand situation is overwhelming the market, they said. However, the end of the decline may be in sight, said Judy Weissman, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. in New York. At around six cents a pound, &quot;sugar becomes increasingly attractive and may draw enough demand to stabilize the market,&quot; she said. </TEXT></DOC>
