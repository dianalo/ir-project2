But the phenomenal success of many such buyouts has caused greed to overtake fear in the hearts of many individual investors.    This hasn't been lost on Wall Street's ever-inventive investment bankers, who have begun tapping that broadening demand with a new range of offerings. One of the latest spins: &quot;LBO stubs.&quot;    Stubs are the shares created when a portion of a company's equity remains publicly traded after a recapitalization or acquisition. In these transactions, investors receive a package consisting mostly of cash and notes, plus a &quot;stub&quot; of equity.    The acquiring group of investors takes the remaining equity private, using leverage, or borrowings, to finance the transaction. Cash flow and often asset sales are used to pay down the debt. Their aim is to generate a big return on equity as the company is restructured and the debt repaid.    Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp., FMC Corp. and Colt Industries Inc. are three companies that produced stubs in the past eight months when they paid shareholders cash and stock in highly leveraged recapitalizations. Multimedia Inc. led the way with a similar transaction in late 1985, and others, including Holiday Corp., are currently working on plans of their own.    Initially, analysts and investors alike recoiled from stubs because they didn't believe the projected returns justified the risks. &quot;Many of them didn't know how to value these securities, or they took one look at the huge leverage and ran away,&quot; says Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. analyst Paul D. Farrell. But such securities have &quot;done so well that people are now fascinated with them, and we have been swamped with questions about them.&quot;    Indeed, judged on their performance to date, stubs have been sweet investments. As the table shows, all but the Colt stubs have outpaced the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index dramatically since they began trading; even the Colt issue has about matched the index. Like any investment fad, however, popularity will almost surely mean lower returns for latecomers, corporate finance specialists say.    In any case, stubs are very speculative investments. &quot;The returns are very high, but the risks are, too,&quot; warns Robert Long, director of high-yield research at First Boston Corp. &quot;These are junior securities to junk bonds, so if you hate junk bonds, you're really going to hate these.&quot;    Leveraged investments can hold out the prospect of generous returns because the heavy use of debt to finance the transactions has the effect of magnifying even small improvements in a company's financial position. But heavy debt can also magnify even a relatively small deterioration in a company's finances.    Since the company requires high, sustained cash flow to cover interest and pay down debt, any shortfall quickly pushes it toward bankruptcy. In the final analysis, that cash flow hinges on economic developments that may be impossible to foresee.    If the company does poorly, equity investors -- who have last claim on any available resources -- would quickly be wiped out. Moreover, while junk bonds at least pay interest while investors are waiting for the leveraged buyout to pay down debt, agreements with lenders generally prohibit stubs from paying dividends.    Unless an investor thinks such securities can produce returns in the order of 30% a year, the risks aren't worthwhile, investment bankers say.    &quot;Investors should look on these like any other highly leveraged instrument, such as options and futures,&quot; says David Gruber, vice president at the leveraged-buyout firm Carl Marks andamp; Co. &quot;Only because you're that kind of investor with a taste for that kind of instrument should you consider it.&quot;    ---                      ENTICING GAINS        Market performance of LBO stubs compared         with Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index    Company                Price Change*    Sandamp;P 500*    (date first traded)    (in percent)     (in percent)    Colt    (10/8/86)                 21.3%            22.7%    FMC    (5/29/86)                 64.9             17.1    Multimedia    (10/2/85)                178.2             57.7    Owens-Corning    (11/6/86)                147.4             18.1   *Through March 11, 1987</TEXT></DOC>
