Also on Thursday, the territorial government announced securityforces killed a black nationalist guerrilla, raising to 313 thenumber of insurgents the South African-led forces say they havekilled since an unexpected April 1 incursion from Angola.   Nicolas Bwakira, chief representative in Namibia for the U.N.High Commissioner for Refugees, said a five-week repatriation willstart May 22, provided the South African-appointed territorialauthorities implement an amnesty and repeal racist laws.   Both steps are called for in the U.N. plan to end 74 years ofSouth African rule. South Africa has agreed to grant independenceas part of a regional agreement calling for the withdrawal of50,000 Cuban troops from Angola.   Most exiles have lived in Angola or Zambia since fleeing Namibiaduring a 23-year guerrilla war waged by the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization.   Bwakira said some exiles will return from Angola on foot, butmost will be flown back.   They will be given food rations and cooking utensils andencouraged to leave U.N.-supervised reception centers within a weekof arrival, said Bwakira, of Burundi, Central Africa.   Namibian churches are to provide long-term care for 1,500orphans, elderly and disabled returnees.   At a separate news conference, a government spokesman announcedthe killing of a SWAPO guerrilla but gave no details.   He said the fighter was among 1,600 guerrillas who infiltratedfrom Angola after April 1. Pretoria says the incursion violates theU.N. plan. SWAPO was not a signatory to the accord signed byAngola, Cuba and South Africa.   Saturday marks the end of a two-week period in which U.N. andsecurity force officials were to verify whether the guerrillas havewithdrawn. South Africa says its troops will be confined to baseonly if a total SWAPO pullout is confirmed. This will be discussedat a meeting Monday with Angolan and Cuban officials.   The guerrillas are to return home, unarmed, with the refugees.   It is estimated there are perhaps 58,000 Namibian exiles.Bwakira said 32,950 have registered to be repatriated. Others mayregister later or decide after independence, scheduled early nextyear.   Most exiles support SWAPO and Bwakira said the U.N. monitoringforce in Namibia will seek to ensure their return takes place``without fear of intimidation, harassment or prosecution.''   The repatriation will cost $38 million, of which $31 millionalready has been pledged by Western governments, Bwakira said. Itincludes $10 million from Nordic countries, $5 million from theUnited States and $1 million from Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
