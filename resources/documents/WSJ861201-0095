DorfmanStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/01/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES </IN><TEXT>   Crazy Eddie's prices may be insane, as his ads say, but his timing comes straight from a tax planner's manual.    Eddie Antar, chairman and founder of Crazy Eddie Inc., an Edison, N.J.-based discount electronics retailer, sold about 1.5 million shares, or about a third of his holdings, last month. Through a spokesman, he said he wanted to take advantage of the 20% capital gains tax rate while it lasts.    In January, that rate becomes 28%, and in 1988 some individuals will pay as much as 33% on capital gains. So, some tax planners would say, Crazy Eddie was crazy like a fox, and lots of corporate insiders would be well advised to do likewise.    Not too many are. Investors are doing more tax selling than usual this year, and much of it is to nail down gains at the favorable rate. But, at least so far, there's no wave of selling by officers, directors, and major stockholders -- the classic corporate insiders. To some professionals, that's a bullish indicator for the market.    The tax code change, says James E. Conway, chairman of Ayco Corp., a financial-planning unit of American Express Co., &quot;is really not motivating a lot of changes that might make sense theoretically. The smaller companies are still driven by entrepreneurs, often the founders. By definition, they are eternal optimists. They tend to ignore advice about diversification and asset allocation. They tend to ride the one horse -- it got them this far.&quot;    One of them is J. Richard Eshleman, president of Landmark Savings Association in Pittsburgh, who recently added 400 shares to the 5,150 he had. &quot;I've never sold one share of this company's stock,&quot; he says. &quot;I've bought and continued to buy. At the present time our stock is lower than what I think it's worth. My transactions are long-term transactions. This stock may be going into my estate or for my retirement. Who knows what the capital gains rate will be at that time?&quot;    Karen Spero, a financial planner in Cleveland, says that many executives think the capital gains rate may change again, perhaps several times, before they finally sell. &quot;Frequently, they don't believe that the new tax rules will hold,&quot; she says. She herself hasn't given up hope that some favorable tax treatment for capital gains may be restored in 1987 or 1988.    Meanwhile, Ms. Spero says, corporate insiders with major gains are reluctant to pay extra tax by taking gains now, favorable rate or no. &quot;I don't think anyone really likes to take that hit,&quot; she says.    All this is a bit disappointing to people like Maynard Engel, director of the personal financial planning division at E.F. Hutton andamp; Co. in New York. Mr. Engel believes that a number of corporate insiders with big gains are making a mistake if they don't take some gains this year. He points out that a $10,000 gain will require $800 more in taxes next year than this year, which amounts to a 40% increase in the tax bite even though the rate goes up only eight percentage points.    For people who want to take gains at the 20% rate but maintain a major stake in their company, Mr. Engel sometimes recommends selling and buying back. Mr. Engel says some of his clients have done that, but planners report that relatively little of such activity is going on. A screening of insiders' filings of trading activity with the Securities and Exchange Commission, conducted by the Institute for Econometric Research, shows little evidence of sell-and-buyback transactions from Sept. 1 through Nov. 19.    In fact, people who follow the SEC filings say little insider selling is going on, for tax reasons or otherwise. One widely watched barometer is the ratio of insider sales to purchases, published by Edwin Buck in his newsletter Vickers Weekly Insider Report. A normal ratio, says Mr. Buck, is 2.5 to 1. This fall, the ratio has been below normal, indicating that corporate insiders are bullish. In the past couple of weeks, tax selling pushed the ratio back up, he says, but only into the normal range.    Michael Reid, editor of Insider Indicator, refines his data by eliminating transactions involving stocks of the 500 large companies in Standard andamp; Poor's index. With that adjustment, he says, there lately have been more insider purchases than sales -- a rare occurrence that he says is strongly bullish for smaller-company stocks.    Surprisingly, Mr. Reid says, corporate insiders in smaller companies were pessimistic early in the year and have turned highly optimistic just when tax factors might motivate them to cash in their chips. &quot;Since the tax law was passed, they've been net buyers,&quot; he says. &quot;Anybody buying in this market has got to be ignoring tax consequences.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
