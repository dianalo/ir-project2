The New York-based credit-rating concern said that the&quot;problems besetting the Big Three auto makers are deeper thanhad been assumed&quot; six months ago, when Sandamp;P lowered the debtratings of Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, since then U.S. car and truck sales havenose-dived, and the auto makers have idled dozens offactories and temporarily laid off thousands of workers.Automotive analysts now estimate that General Motors Corp.incurred a $1.4 billion loss for the 1990 fourth quarter, arecord GM operating loss for any quarter, and that Ford had aloss of as much as $500 million in the period. Many analystsexpect Ford to announce today a cut in its quarterly dividendof 75 cents a share.   Ford sharply criticized Sandamp;P's announcement.   &quot;We believe Standard andamp; Poor's has overreacted to a problemthat is largely cyclical,&quot; said David N. McCammon, Ford'svice president, finance. &quot;It has been well-recognized forsome time that the U.S. and European car markets have becomemore competitive. We have plans and strategies in place, andthe necessary financial resources, to respond to theseproblems.&quot;   The reactions from Chrysler and GM were less harsh.Chrysler said it was &quot;disappointed,&quot; but added that &quot;giventhe difficult environment the industry is working in, we canunderstand {Sandamp;P's} concern.&quot; GM simply said it expects tomeet with Sandamp;P next month &quot;to discuss all relevant matters atthat time.&quot;   Two months ago, Sandamp;P changed its ratings outlook for allthree auto makers to &quot;negative&quot; from &quot;stable.&quot; Sandamp;P saidyesterday that it expects to conclude its current reviews bymid-February.   The Mideast crisis &quot;is exacerbating the cyclical downturnin demand,&quot; said Scott Sprinzen, Sandamp;P's vice president,corporate finance. &quot;The Middle East is undermining consumerconfidence, and that's a big factor in someone deciding tobuy a car now or wait.&quot;   Any further downgrade would hit Chrysler hardest among thethree companies. That is because Sandamp;P's move last June leftChrysler's credit rating on senior debt at triple-B-minus.That's one notch above speculative grade, a rating that wouldforce the auto maker to pay substantially higher interest onborrowings.   As a result of the poor rating and high interest rates itmust contend with now, Chrysler is considering selling astake in its profitable Chrysler Financial Corp. subsidiaryto give the unit greater access to lower-cost credit.   &quot;Chrysler's financial flexibility is adequate for thecompany to weather the current downturn,&quot; but Sandamp;P expressedreservations at the company's ability to &quot;cope with anydisappointments in new product-development initiatives . . ..&quot;   Chrysler officials said yesterday that they hope topersuade Sandamp;P of the benefits that the company's $2.5 billioncost-cutting plan has brought to its operations. Because ofthat plan, Chrysler is expected to post a relatively modestloss for the 1990 fourth quarter or perhaps break-evenresults. All three companies will announce theirfourth-period results next month.   Sandamp;P said Ford's performance in the U.S. and Western Europe&quot;has been particularly disappointing.&quot; Ford's currentdouble-A-minus rating on senior debt could be downgraded oneor two notches, Sandamp;P said, adding that because of &quot;apersistence of weak earnings and cash flow, borrowingrequirements could rise above the level formerlyanticipated.&quot;   Ford's ratio of debt to shareholders' equity has more thantripled during the past year.   GM's senior debt rating of double-A-minus, the same asFord, could be lowered one notch, Sandamp;P said. &quot;Recent massivelosses raise the specter that even more sweepingrestructuring will be necessary if the company is to againattain strong financial performance levels,&quot; Sandamp;P said.</TEXT></DOC>
