The surge in the pre-allocation price for the bonds to 107 1/4 bid, compared with the par issue price, underlined the recovery of the Tokyo stock market from its autumn lows and the renewed demand for Eurobonds linked to Japanese shares, underwriters said.    Meanwhile, Eurodollar bond prices were 1/8 to 1/4 point weaker, following declines in the U.S. Treasury market.    Otherwise, new-issue activity remained centered on dollar offerings targeted to special investor groups, or on non-dollar bonds.    A subsidiary of Bankers Trust New York launched $100 million of five-year Eurobonds, with the usual five coupons. But in a novel twist, any or all of them can be cashed in semiannually at escalating interest rates.    Saeed Abtahi, syndication manager at lead underwriter Bankers Trust International Ltd., said this issue allows investors greater flexibility in managing their coupon cash flow in line with their market view on interest rates. In addition, it minimizes the traditional risk that coupon payments can't be reinvested at an equal or higher rate.    On 10 dates falling either in December or June, investors can cash in their coupons for interest starting at 5.8% and climbing to 8.31%.    To take extreme examples, if rates rose quickly above the maximum 8.31%, investors would want to cash in their coupons early to reinvest the payments at the higher rates available on new securities, Bankers Trust said. Conversely, if rates fell below 5.8%, investors would benefit by delaying until they could get the maximum 8.31% on all five coupons.    Among other issues, a subsidiary of West German machinery group Kloeckner-Humbolt-Deutz AG sold $75 million of 8% seven-year bonds. The bonds were launched at a cost of around 139 basis points above U.S. Treasury yields. A basis point is 1/100 of a percentage point. </TEXT></DOC>
