More specifically the purposes fall intothe following categories:1. Implementation of Management Plans_Certain prohibited activities havebeen recommended as supplemental rules for designated recreation sites,specially designated management areas, and Public Lands in general. Someplan amendments and recommendations are not enforceable as published. Inorder to implement these recommendations, they must be published as specificprohibitied acts in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Use of the supplemental rules section of 43CFR subpart 8365.1-6, is the most appropriate way of implementing theserecommendations. Rationale for these recommendations are presented in theirentirety in the final management plan for the specific area.2. Mitigation of User Conflict_Certain other supplementary rules are recommendedbecause of specific user conflict problems. Prohibiting the reservationof camping space in developed campgrounds will allow such space to be availableon first come first serve basis. This will prevent a few persons from monopolizingthe use of limited developed camping space. Motorized vehicle freeplayis recommended as a prohibited act to minimize the noise and nuisance factorthat such activity represents in a developed recreation site.3. Public Health and Safety_The erection and maintenance of temporary toiletstuctures on the public lands could represent a major threat to publicsafety and health due to the concentration of human wastes. The erectionand maintenance of temporary toilets may be permitted by the authorizedofficer on a case by case basis and only when appropriate state and localpermits have been obtained.It should be noted that the shooting restrictions recommended do not prohibitlegitimate hunting activities, and therefore do not conflict with the NewMexico Department of Game and Fish Regulations. Recreational shooters areencouraged to use public land where such shooting restrictions do not apply.4. Complimentary Rules_Some supplementary rules are recommended to complimentthose of other Federal, state and local agenices. Because these rules providefor the protection of persons and resources and in the interest and spiritof cooperation with the responsible agenices, these supplementary rulesare deemed necessary.<ITAG tagnum="84">Definitions</ITAG>1.
