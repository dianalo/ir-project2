Like nearly every investor in takeover stocks, Merrill had big trading losses last fall after the Ivan Boesky insider-trading case roiled the stock market. Yesterday the giant investment bank said it plans to bring its arbitrage group more under the control of its traditional stock-trading operation. It also said its arbitragers will put a greater portion of their investments into options and other hedging vehicles to minimize trading losses.    In addition, Wall Street sources said that Timothy L. Tabor, a 33-year-old trader who took over Merrill's arbitrage operation last June, plans to leave the firm. Mr. Tabor's superiors moved him out of his day-to-day trading role shortly after the Boesky news broke, the sources said.    Mr. Tabor declined to comment. Merrill Lynch said Mr. Tabor hasn't officially notified the firm about his plans but said his superiors had been taking on more responsibility in running the arbitrage group.    The changes at Merrill's arbitrage operation, which has five employees and an average of about $100 million in its portfolio, aren't expected to appreciably affect the overall performance of the company, the nation's largest securities firm. But they are significant because they mark one of the most sweeping assessments a major securities firm has made about the Boesky scandal's impact on the stock market.    &quot;The environment for merchant banking, junk (high-yield, high-risk) bonds, and arbitrage has changed dramatically,&quot; said Brian Barefoot, the director of Merrill's global broker-dealer group, explaining the firm's arbitrage strategy shift. &quot;Any firm in any of these businesses that isn't trying to figure out how they want to participate in a different environment is probably not doing its job.&quot;    Mr. Barefoot said Merrill believes the insider-trading scandals will lead to fewer and riskier corporate takeovers. &quot;We've concluded that we'd prefer to have a lower-risk profile,&quot; he said.    Mr. Barefoot said press reports that the post-Boesky stock-market chaos in November and December led to arbitrage losses of $40 million to $50 million at Merrill were &quot;greatly exaggerated.&quot; But he said the losses effectively wiped out the firm's arbitrage profits of the first 10 months of 1986. &quot;It was basically a break-even year in arbitrage,&quot; he said, declining to specify figures.    He said Merrill began putting its new, lower-risk arbitrage investment strategy into place at the start of the year and said changes will continue to be made for about another month. Merrill doesn't plan to change the size of the arbitrage group's staff or portfolio, he said.    For Mr. Tabor, the changes at Merrill mark the end of another chapter in what is becoming one of Wall Street's most peripatetic careers. Last February the former Rhodes scholar left Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. to start a new arbitrage unit at Chemical New York Corp. In June Chemical scrapped the unit, amid controversy over the commercial bank's highly unusual role in takeover speculation, and Merrill snapped up Mr. Tabor.    Mr. Barefoot said that Merrill officials have discussed with Mr. Tabor the firm's planned changes, and he speculated that they probably wouldn't suit Mr. Tabor's trading style. But he said Merrill still doesn't know whether Mr. Tabor will stay at the firm.    However, other Wall Street sources said Mr. Tabor has resolved to leave Merrill because of personality clashes with his immediate supervisor, Martin E. Kaplan, director of equity trading.    Mr. Kaplan wasn't available for comment. It is understood that since Merrill's big losses after the Boesky news, Mr. Kaplan has effectively been running the firm's arbitrage operations. </TEXT></DOC>
