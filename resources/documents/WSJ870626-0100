IbrahimStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><DATELINE> VIENNA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   An imminent expansion of Iraq's oil exports has emerged as a threat to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' efforts to stabilize oil prices at $18 a barrel.    The Arab producer is pursuing a major increase in its oil export capacity to 2.7 million barrels a day by October from its current 2.2 million barrels a day. When completed, the expansion will make Iraq the world's second-largest oil exporter after Saudi Arabia and well ahead of its Persian Gulf enemy Iran, which currently produces 2.2 million barrels a day.    OPEC's recommended quota for Iraq is 1.6 million barrels a day for the remainder of the year.    OPEC's problem is complicated by Iraq's having declared itself outside any of the cartel's production quotas, despite other OPEC members' acceptance since December of strict production limits.    &quot;We are asking the organization what it will do about Iraq's runaway production,&quot; Iran's oil minister, Gholamreza Aghazadeh, said yesterday, the first day of OPEC's ministerial meeting here.    Other delegates said failure to address Iraq's production increase before autumn would diminish the meaning of any agreement reached here. They said it also could jeopardize OPEC's success in raising oil prices to the current $18 or so a barrel from under $10 a barrel last year. OPEC sources said the basic problem is that OPEC, including Iraq, will be pumping some 20 million barrels a day by autumn into a world market expected to need only about 17.5 million barrels a day of the group's oil.    Nevertheless, U.S. oil futures rose amid speculation that OPEC may lower its ceiling on fourth-quarter output. Crude oil for August delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose 24 cents, to $19.64 a barrel.    Within OPEC, the problem is political as well as economic. Many members look to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to end their gifts of free oil sent to Iraq in support of its war against Iran.    So far, the Iraqi problem has been swept under the carpet here. But with the Iraqi production expansion imminent, many sources here say it can't any longer be ignored. &quot;It is topic No. 1 behind the scenes,&quot; one senior Arab delegate said.    Iraq is boosting by 50% the capacity of the pipeline that already carries a million barrels a day via Turkey to the Mediterranean Sea. It sends another 500,000 barrels a day via pipeline through Saudi Arabia to the Red Sea and trucks via Jordan a little more than 100,000 barrels a day. In addition, Iraq receives the 300,000 free barrels of Saudi and Kuwaiti oil a day to support its seven-year-old conflict with Iran. Finally, it produces about 300,000 to 400,000 barrels a day for domestic consumption.    OPEC officials said they would resume their meeting today to review their global production program for the next six months. They said there was &quot;solid agreement&quot; on the need to hold oil prices at $18 a barrel. </TEXT></DOC>
