(WallaceCarlisle)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Lowe, Sue J.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Wallace Carlisle, technical staff member of AT and T's ConnectorSystems Development Group, designed the straight tip (ST)connector for optical fiber links, which is being hailed as theequivalent of the RS-232 connector that links copper-basedcabling.andP;  The ST connector relies on a sleeve that expandsuniformly and self-aligns when two ferrule plugs with fiber havedifferent external diameters, allowing for precise alignment ofthe fibers and minimum light loss.andP;  About 0.3 decibels of alightwave signal's strength are lost in an ST connector.andP;  Theconnector is also spring-loaded and keyed for repeatedconnections.andP;  ST II was designed to accommodate single-mode fiberfor future use in bringing fiber to the home.andP;  Installers of ST IIuse a protruding fiber polishing technique to make fibers touch.andO;An estimated one third of all data communications users are usingthe ST connector.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   American Telephone and Telegraph Co.
