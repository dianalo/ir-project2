Largefluctuations in oil exploration activities, caused by large changes inoil price account for short term shortages and surpluses of petroleumproducing capacity. Overlooking the importance of these cycles has maderational planning regarding alternative energy sources difficult. Petroleumreserves are finite, but large. Conservation and displacement of petroleumand natural gas with coal and biomass will serve to extend the availabilityof petroleum. There will not be requirements for large scale synfuelplants until beyond 2020 or perhaps later, assuming a reasonable stableglobal political environment. At that time other factors will complicateplanning for large scale use of synfuels and alternative energy sources.These factors include difficulty in making unbiased cost estimates, needfor the economies of large scale operation, higher valued uses for biomassthan energy, and parallel inflation of energy costs and commercial constructioncosts.</TEXT></DOC>
