The proposed company will make earthmoving equipment forsale throughout Europe, the Mideast and Africa, and willprovide a way for Deere to expand its presence in Europe,where it currently has no manufacturing facilities andextremely limited sales of U.S.-made equipment.</LP><TEXT>   The new company will be at least 50%-owned by Fiat andwill be based here with mainly Fiat managers. Talks oninvestment levels and the size of the minority stakes thatHitachi and Deere will have are expected to take severalmonths.   Since 1989, Fiat has had a venture with Hitachi, buildinghydraulic excavators at a plant at San Mauro, Italy. Theproposed new company will be broader-based and produce a fullrange of products, including bulldozers, mechanical loaders,motor scrapers and hydraulic excavators. Deere, like Hitachi,will contribute technology. Fiat will provide the salesnetwork.   In Moline, Ill., Deere officials declined to discuss thesize of the stake or their expected investment. Since 1989,Deere has been producing hydraulic excavators at a NorthCarolina plant for distribution in the Americas under a jointventure with Hitachi. It also produces loaders, backhoes andother gear for Hitachi to sell under the Hitachi brand inJapan. Deere also has licensed Fiat to use Deere technologyfor backhoe loaders in Italy.   The latest venture would forge a further link with Fiat,which is a major Deere competitor in the U.S. for tractorsand related agricultural equipment through its 80%-owned NewHolland unit, bought from Ford Motor Co. earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
