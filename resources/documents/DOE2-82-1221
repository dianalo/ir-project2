In the last ten years numerous energy supplyconcepts have been drawn up at local and regional level. The FederalGovernment had made repeated calls for this and had itself suggesteda working programme to support the communities and energy suppliers.The development of energy supply concepts was nevertheless the subjectof heated discussions from the beginning. If the latter were at firstsparked off mainly by the question of overall control and sponsorship,later it was increasingly aspects of principles and political pointsof order which came to the fore. In order to resolve the important questionson this subject, the Federal Minister for Economy tasked the German Institutefor Economic Research along with Prognos AG, with an investigation ofthe form and application of existing local and regional energy supplyconcepts with special consideration of their influence on the energycarrier competition. This published investigation provides for the firsttime an almost complete stock-taking of the energy supply concepts existingin the Federal Republic of Germany. It was possible to establish thecompetitive significance as well as produce a consolidating analysisof a larger number of concepts already at the application stage.</TEXT></DOC>
