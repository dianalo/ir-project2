In an article titled ``Diagnosis: Syringe,'' the labor daily Trudsaid ``criminal negligence'' was under investigation at thechildren's hospital in Elista. Authorities discovered the outbreakin November, the newspaper said.   The Soviet Union only recently admitted to an AIDS problem andstarted diagnosis and treatment programs.   Trud said that of 300 people screened at the hospital, 27 babiesand children, most under two years old, and four mothers were foundto have the deadly disease.   The newspaper said further tests were planned on 1,000 childrenat the hospital, as well as on patients at facilities elsewhere inRussia.   ``I believe it can be said simply: guilty are the medicalworkers, nurses who probably used non-sterile syringes or used onesyringe, changing only the needle, which is about the same thing,''said V.I. Pokrovsky of the Central Scientific Research Institute ofEpidemiology in Moscow.   He told Trud an investigation and trial would be conducted.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus thatdamages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible toinfections and cancer.   It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles orsyringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products,and from pregnant women to their offspring.</TEXT></DOC>
