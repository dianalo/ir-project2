SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Older Americans flexed their political muscleslast November, while interest in choosing a new president flaggedamong other age groups, the Census Bureau reports.   Some 68.8 percent of people aged 65 and over reported going tothe polls last fall, the only age group to show an increase from theelection four years earlier, according to the analysis released onTuesday. Senior citizens voted at a 67.7 percent rate in 1984.   ``The elderly have been getting a lot of attention and havebecome a great deal more active then ever before,'' said CensusBureau statistician Jerry Jennings. ``They are becoming a much moreself-conscious group than before and are beginning to recognizetheir power.''   While the over-65 group was tops in turnout, the 45-to-64 agesegment wasn't far behind at 67.9 percent last November. But thatwas down from 69.8 percent four years earlier.   Turnout by voters aged 25 to 44 fell from 58.4 percent to 54.0percent, and in the 18 to 24 group it dropped from 40.8 percent to36.2 percent.   Overall, the Census analysis found voter turnout down 3percentage points from 1984 and _ at 57 percent _ the lowest sincethe bureau began asking about voting in 1964.   As usual, more people told the Census Bureau they had voted thanthere were votes actually cast, a phenomenon which the bureau gentlyterms ``misreporting.''   The total vote amounted to about 50 percent of the number ofpeople of voting age in the country, the post-election count found.   But when the Census Bureau surveyed about 55,000 households twoweeks after the election, 57.4 percent reported having gone to thepolls.   Does that mean people lie to the census takers?   ``Yes,'' said Jennings, ``That's the greater part of it.''   The purpose of the survey is not to find out how many peoplevoted _ to do that you have to count the votes, Jennings pointed out.   The survey compares the turnout among regions and groups ofpeople. That comparison is valid, he said, ``with one groupmisreporting about as much as another.''   Either way, it was a 3 percentage point drop from 1984 and thelowest turnout in many years.   At 57 percent, the Census figure is the lowest ever recorded bythat agency, while the national vote total hasn't been as low ashalf in a presidential year since 1924, according to figurescompiled by the private Committee for the Study of the AmericanElectorate.   The drop in turnout was greatest for blacks and Hispanics, theCensus study found.   ``By and large, when there is a change in voter turnout it isgreatest in segments of the population which have the lowest turnoutto begin with,'' Jennings said. ``I suspect that is what ishappening here.''   Only 51.5 percent of voting-age blacks said they had castballots, down from 55.8 percent four years earlier. For Hispanicsthe decline was from 32.6 percent to 28.8 percent.   The white turnout fell from 61.4 percent to 59.2 percent between1984 and 1988.   Women held their lead over males in voting, 58.3 percent to 56.4percent last year. In 1984 women had led 60.8 percent to 59.0percent.   As usual, the Midwest topped the nation last fall with 62.9percent reporting they voted, a drop from 65.7 percent in 1984. TheNortheast was second at 57.4 percent, down from 59.7 percent.   Turnout in the West fell from 58.5 percent to 55.6 percent, whilein the South it dropped from 56.8 percent to 54.5 percent between1984 and 1988.   Education seems to encourage voting, with 77.6 percent of collegegraduates turning out. Next were people with some college, 64.5percent and then high school graduates, 54.7 percent. Only 41.3percent of those who hadn't finished high school voted, and turnoutwas 36.7 percent for people who hadn't gone beyond grade school.   People with jobs outvoted the unemployed, 58.4 percent to 38.6percent. People who own their own home turned out at a 70.0 percentrate, while only 39.8 percent of renters reported voting.   Because it is based on a survey the study can be subject tosampling error. The Census Bureau estimates the margin of error forthe overall turnout at four-tenths of 1 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
