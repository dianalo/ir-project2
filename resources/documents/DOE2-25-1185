<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-25-1185 </DOCNO><TEXT>Gives a general description of the work performed by the mine ventilationdepression service, which was set up to assess the state of ventilationin coal mines in the USSR (according to par. 220 of the 1986 Safety Regulations,such assessments must be performed at each mine at least once every 3years). Assessments in 1986 at 188 mines revealed serious failings: airleaks at main blowers were over twice the set norm, and internal leaks(poor quality stoppings, doors, etc.) were also twice the norm. Examplesare given of identification by the service of erroneous planning decisionson ventilation taken at several Donbass mines. The information providedby the service, which constitutes a crucial link between mine planningand mine operation, is not sufficiently utilized. VNIIGD has writtena computer program for the ES computer which will allow computer monitoringof all ventilation systems. This program was delivered to coal industrycomputer centers in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
