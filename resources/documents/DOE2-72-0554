State diagram of Ni-HfC/sub 0.98/-TaC/sub 0.89/ system hasone multivariant eutectics with equilibrium phases, presented by nickelbase solid solution and carbide phase (Hf/sub n/Ta/sub m/)C of variablecomposition. Metastable carbide phases, responsible for decrease of temperatureof alloy melting initiation, form during their cooling from liquid statewith the rate of above 80 deg.C/min.</TEXT></DOC>
