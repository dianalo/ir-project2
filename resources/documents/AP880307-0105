Belonogov made his statements in an unusual news conferenceoutside the U.N. Security Council, which later met behind closeddoors on the Iran-Iraq conflict.   Last July, the Security Council demanded an immediate cease-firein the 7{-year-old war. The United States is now pushing for anarms embargo against Iran for rebuffing the resolution, but theSoviets have balked at an embargo.   Belonogov said he met Monday with Secretary-General Javier Perezde Cuellar and with the president of the Security Council thismonth, Yugoslav Ambassador Dragoslav Pejic, and urged them ``in themost energetic terms'' to try to persuade Iran and Iraq to stop themissile attacks.   ``It is difficult to say what political and psychologicalconsequences the war of the cities may result in,'' Belonogov said.   ``The position of my country is clear. We are for the soonestpossible political resolution of the conflict between Iran and Iraqand for the speediest possible implementation of the'' cease-fireresolution.   Belonogov was also asked whether his country believes Iran nowaccepts the cease-fire resolution, as it seemed to claim in anambiguous unsigned note to the council last week.   ``We don't think that it would be right just to disregard thenew developments in the situation,'' he said, refusing to elaborate.   The unsigned note from Iran claimed that a Feb. 28 letter fromits foreign minister constituted acceptance of the resolution. Theletter, however, did not say that Iran endorsed the resolution.   British Ambassador Sir Crispin Tickell on Monday called theletter ``an undated, unsigned scrap of paper.''   ``Where does that leave us?'' he said. ``It does not constitutea clear acceptance.''   State Department spokesman Charles Redman said in WashingtonMonday that the United States doesn't accept the unsigned noteeither and will keep pushing for an arms embargo on Iran.   Each of the five permanent members of the Security Council _ theSoviet Union, China, France, Britain and the United States _ hasthe power to veto an embargo resolution.   The Soviets are close allies of Iraq but have also been tryingto improve relations with neighboring Iran. Both Iran and Iraq arebelieved to be using Soviet-made missiles in the ``war of thecities.''   Belonogov denied that what he called ``the defensive weapons nowused against Tehran and other cities'' are Soviet-made.</TEXT></DOC>
