But the alleged debtor, the city of Austin, Texas, seesthe routine legal maneuver as naked aggression, probablybecause the bill arises from a touchy situation: 27 nudemassages that Mr. Buschman's lawyer says were performed onvice officers from the Austin Police Department.</LP><TEXT>   According to the lawyer, Laird Palmer of Austin, theofficers received the massages during undercoverinvestigations of his client's three massage parlors. Theinvestigations led to the filing of 27 misdemeanor charges ofprostitution. &quot;After the massage was paid for and given, thenthe officer would solicit sex,&quot; Mr. Palmer says. &quot;When thegirl agreed, he'd arrest her and take his money back.&quot;   Here's the rub: The prostitution charges were dropped, orthe defendants acquitted, in all but two of the 27 cases,according to Mr. Palmer, who represented all of the womencharged. Therefore, he contends, Mr. Buschman is entitled tobe paid for the legitimate services that were rendered at hisbusinesses.   &quot;The money the police officer paid was for a legal act,&quot;he says. &quot;It is absolutely not a sexual act.&quot;   The city of Austin doesn't agree and has refused to paythe bill for $2,790 presented by Mr. Palmer. And since thelawyer threatened last week to file a lawsuit, the city won'tcomment on the dispute beyond saying that its lawyers &quot;findno basis for paying it.&quot; An officer with the vice squadconfirms that the parlors were the subject of an undercoverinvestigation during the time covered by the bill, but theofficer said he couldn't confirm that the massages wereactually performed.   Travis County Attorney Ken Oden, whose office prosecutesmisdemeanor criminal cases in Austin, says he couldn'tconfirm Mr. Palmer's assertion about the disposition of thecases without more-specific information. But he was familiarwith Mr. Palmer's quest for renumeration for his client andadds: &quot;I haven't heard anything that makes me think the cityowes those people any money.&quot;   The problem can't be the size of the bill, Mr. Palmerinsists, because his client is charging the usual hourly rateof $130 for naked massages. If that still seems a littlesteep, Mr. Palmer compares it with a $3 scotch-and-water athappy hour: &quot;At a topless bar, the same drink will cost you$6 because it comes with a naked lady.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
