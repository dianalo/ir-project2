Forminerals of low magnetic susceptibility, use of these circuits has manydisadvantages. Only a separator with a superconducting magnet can contributeto solving the problems and produce a high magnetic field. This paperpresents and describes a magnetic separator having a superconductingmagnet with integrated closed circuit for helium liquefaction. The systemgenerator and maintenance are simplified by extensive automation realizedby a versatile programmable autocontrol unit. A comparative study ofthe results on concentration and purification of different raw materialswith the new and with conventional separators is described.</TEXT></DOC>
