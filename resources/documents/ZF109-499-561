In addition, VLSI chipshave become available for building both MCA computers and expansion boards.andM;These facts lead to an inescapable conclusion: If you care about performance,you need to know about Micro Channel architecture.andP;  PC Labs has found thatISA-bus machines are cost-effective, high-performance products that work wellwith today's DOS or on small LANS, yet MCA (or the non-IBM alternative, EISA)remains an intriguing choice for duty on high-end networks, as well as forfuture applications, because of its many advanced features.andM;PHILOSOPHICALLY SPEAKINGandM;The Micro Channel bus, the connectors into which you plug expansion boards,and the circuitry that links them together are only the embodiment of the MCAspecification-the blueprint or building code that out lines all the rules forbuilding this type of computer.andM;The distinction between the MCA specification and its physical embodiment isan important one.andP;  Real computers are implementations of the MCA design,defined by it rather than defining it.andP;  The MCA specification is not static;it's designed to be changeable while maintaining compatibility.andP;  It is itselfmore flexible than any single computer could possibly be, allowing a widevariety of computers to be built around its architectural core.andP;  MCAcomputers do not have to incorporate all the features of the MCAspecification to be compatible; for example, 8-, 16-, and 32-bit bus designsare possible.andM;Because MCA is a specification, fully defining it means understanding andabsorbing reams of diagrams, scads of schematics, and a dossier ofdescriptions.andP;  But all of the information can be distilled to a few essentialconcepts that characterize the four fundamental areas in which thisarchitecture improves on the AT bus: performance, concurrency, reliability,and accessibility.andM;MCA cams a performance edge in several ways.andP;  First and foremost, it'sdesigned to operate faster.andP;  The biggest speed limit on classic-bus computersis their tendency to emit electromagnetic interference.andP;  The MCA designminimizes this interference, so that its bus can potentially operate fasterthan the AT bus.andP;  Current MCA implementations are 25 percent faster thanclassic-bus machines on like chores simply because most MCA computers have a10-MHZ bus clock and most AT-bus (and EISA) machines have 8-MHz bus clocks.andO;Beyond that advantage, features that are already defined but not implementedin today's PS/2s allow for speed increases of up to 800 percent in futurecomputers.andM;DOUBLE DATAandM;MCA gains performance over the AT bus with its full 32-bit bus width,doubling its data-handling capacity.andP;  The original MCA specification includedseveral new bus protocols, including burst mode and matched-memory cycles, toimprove data transfer speed.andP;  When the MCA specification was revised with theintroduction of IBM's RISC System/6000, more fast-transfer modes were added,including streaming data mode and multiplex data transfers.andP;  Future MCAcomputers and peripherals that take advantage of all the provisions of therevised MCA specifications can potentially transfer data across theirexpansion buses at 160 megabytes per second.andP;  That compares to 16 MBps on theAT bus, 20 MBps on the original MCA, and 33 MBps under the EISA specificationas it stands at the time of this writing.andM;MCA is designed for concurrency, which means that it is capable of supportingboth multitasking and parallel processing.andP;  It combines bus masters and ahardware-controlled arbitration system to break the direct link between acomputer's microprocessor and the expansion bus (see the sidebar &quot;Bus MastersTake Charge&quot;).andM;In AT-style computers, the expansion bus is merely an extension of thesystem's microprocessor, and the microprocessor is burdened with handlingevery transaction that travels across the bus.andP;  The MCA design broadens thebus bandwidth beyond the data-handling abilities of any single microprocessorand allows several intelligent subsystems to share the bus effectively.andM;Today, bus mastering doesn't make much difference.andP;  After all, DOS is asingle-tasking operating system, and the performance of the AT bus exceedsmost single expansion boards.andP;  For example, the 10-MHZ data speed of an ESDIhard disk controller or Ethernet adapter is not constrained by AT busperformance.andP;  But MCA comes into its own when multiple intelligent adaptershave to operate simultaneously.andM;Right now, only multiuser systems--networks and workgroup computers--needthat kind of power.andP;  In the future, new operating systems offer the hope thateven single-user systems will benefit from bus-mastering designs like MCA andEISA.andP;  Imagine, for instance, an advanced version of OS/2 in which eachthread of a task could automatically be directed to a separate MCA busmaster.andM;CRASH DUMMIESandM;The Micro Channel architecture is designed to be especially reliable.andP;  Thanksto such advanced technologies as surface-mount components andapplication-specific VLSI (very large-scale integration) circuits, IBMPersonal Systems are designed to operate considerably longer without failuresthan PCs and ATs.andP;  For many businesses, that translates to correspondinglycheaper maintenance and service contracts.andP;  For individuals, that should meanfewer costly, frustrating trips to the repair shop.andM;Earlier this year, MCA's theoretical reliability seemed at odds with reality:Some MCA hardware was reportedly failure-prone.andP;  But for the most part, theseproblems were related to manufacturing difficulties on the part of IBM andMCA clone vendors and to the software shortcomings of third-party peripheralvendors, rather than to actual defects in the MCA specification.andP;  Inparticular, the adapter description files that some peripheral manufacturersprovided did not precisely follow IBM's specifications; as a result, someexpansion boards failed to operate properly.andP;  Most of these problems wereresolved by the time PC Labs conducted the testing for this review.andM;Of course, reliability means more than just having your computer work whenyou turn it on.andP;  You also have the right to expect that your computer won'tadd errors to your data or just randomly crash.andP;  MCA incorporates severalerror-detection systems to prevent such occurrences.andP;  Parity checking acrossthe MCA expansion bus ensures that every data transfer is accurate.andO;Asynchronous and synchronous error-detection systems not only stopnoise-induced errors (which are admittedly rare) from rippling through yourdata but also help locate the exact part of your system and program in whicheach error occurs.andP;  In addition, MCA's watchdog timer helps prevent a crashin one task on a multitasking system from dragging down your entire computer.andM;The MCA design also improves the accessibility of personal computers to newusers.andP;  System setup and expansion board installation are simplified througha consistent menu-driven software interface that automatically coordinatesthe conflicting demands of multiple expansion boards without making youadjust switches or jumpers.andP;  Expansion boards are easier to plug in,requiring no tools.andP;  They even have plastic grips to make them easy to pullout.andM;Unfortunately, not all manufacturers follow IBM's lead in making MCAcomputers more accessible.andP;  Some MCA computers and accessories still cling totheir beloved DIP switches.andP;  Many still require you to twist out screws toget at their expansion boards (which you can then remove without tools!).andM;PLUG-IN PROBLEMSandM;When manufacturers take such liberties with the underlying concepts of MCA,the question of compatibility arises.andP;  All MCA computers are theoreticallycompatible.andP;  The reality may be different.andP;  Although IBM requires that allmanufacturers of MCA computers be licensed to use IBM technology (therequirement actually stretches to all personal computer manufacturers), anIBM license is no guarantee of compatibility.andP;  It's merely an authorization;like a driver's license, it is neither a certification of ability nor apromise of assistance.andP;  An IBM license only gives a manufacturer permissionto attempt making an MCA computer.andP;  The only direct aid that IBM givesdevelopers is its uneven technical reference manuals and sometimes a seminar(although the company reportedly has been assisting the makers of MCAexpansion boards in creating compatible products).andM;Consequently, you have no real guarantee that a supposedly compatible MCAcomputer meets all of IBM's specifications.andP;  When PC Labs first began to testthe compatibility of MCA computers nearly a year ago, the machines'incompatibilities and inconsistencies were not very subtle.andP;  In the last sixmonths, however, the makers of MCA computers have addressed most of theproblems the Labs turned up.andP;  With few exceptions, the incompatibilities havebeen corrected.andM;PC Labs examined not only whether a board could be installed in the mannerenvisioned under the MCA specification, but also whether each board wouldfunction properly once it was installed.andP;  We used only expansion productsfrom top-name vendors that included well-written ADF files.andP;  A diversity ofperipherals, from fax boards to network cards to tape backup units, wereinstalled and tested to see whether these MCA machines were truly compatibleat last.andM;The two failures in our tests show that plug-and-play operation of MCAcomputers and expansion boards is getting better, although it's still notperfect.andP;  You may still need to do some head scratching-as you would withclassic AT-bus computers.andM;SLOW GAIN, MUCH PAINandM;Within three years of its introduction, the classic PC AT bus was the mostpopular expansion design among personal computers.andP;  MCA has not found suchwide-ranging support.andP;  Beyond the greater difficulty in crafting compatiblemachines, there are other reasons, too.andM;One factor has been users' reluctance to abandon the classic AT bus.andP;  Notonly are they comfortable with that bus, they often have a substantialinvestment in old expansion boards that won't work with MCA.andP;  In contrast tothe United States, where the AT standard is entrenched, MCA computers areselling extremely well in the European market.andP;  The Continent was slow toembrace the classic AT bus, and few there are attached to it.andM;Cost is another reason why MCA has been slow to catch on in the U.S.andP;  Cloningan MCA computer takes a toll, in the form of the licensing fees IBM demandsfor the use of its technologies.andP;  Even renegade Compaq reportedly pays forIBM licenses.andP;  The terms of these agreements can only be speculative becauseIBM does not disclose the cost or nature of its licensing agreements.andP;  Costsreputedly range from nothing (as in cases of cross-licensing, where IBM andanother manufacturer trade access to each other's technologies) to as much as5 percent of the price of the finished computer.andP;  Many industry sources havereported that IBM has had to reduce the high cost of MCA licenses to increasethe architecture's acceptance among manufacturers.andM;MCA technology still appears pricey indeed.andP;  When a manufacturer offerssimilar machines that use the same microprocessor but differ in bus design,the MCA version typically costs $1,000 more than its classic-bus counterpart.andO;EISA machines incur a similar price premium.andP;  Either way, that's a lot to payfor promises, considering that the benefits of these advanced bustechnologies are elusive at best with today's software.andM;Perhaps the most important reason that more people haven't bought MCAcomputers is the limited number of MCA machines manufactured.andP;  Largercorporations have been buying MCA computers as fast as IBM could make them.andO;(Among other factors, they like the improved reliability of IB M's MCAcomputers, which is actually a result of the machines' advanced circuitry,not their expansion buses.) With the exception of the rarely publicized Tandy5000 MC, however, MCA clones weren't available until just a few months ago.andM;THE COMPETITORSandM;Finally that situation is changing, as the 12 machines in this reviewdemonstrate.andP;  If you want Micro Channel architecture in your next PC, you nowhave a choice, even if you restrict yourself to the highest-performancemachines based on the latest microprocessors, such as the Intel 386SX, 386,and 486.andM;This review is limited to computers based on 386SX and 386DX chips, becausewe wouldn't recommend a lesser microprocessor in an MCA PC-or any PC.andP;  Thespeed ratings of these machines range through the entire power spectrum.andO;Those with the lowest clock speeds operate at 16 MHz: the Apricot Qi 300-80,IBM PS/2 Model 65SX, and Wang MC 350/16S.andP;  Three machines have 20-MHz clocks:the NCR PC386sx/MC[.sub.]20'  Reply 386SX/20, and Tandy 5000 MC.andP;  Five morerun at 25 MHz: the Apricot Qi PCi, IBM PS/2 Model 70-A21, Memorex Telex 7270Intelligent Workstation, Mitac MPS3000F, and Olivetti P800.andP;  The fastestclock, at 33 MHz, belongs to the ALR MicroFlex 3300.andM;These compatibles are not much cheaper than IBM's own MCA computers(presumably, thanks to the licensing fee and the cost of development).andO;Consequently, price is not the most compelling reason to choose a compatiblerather than an IBM MCA machine.andP;  Instead, you'll want to look at features andperformance.andP;  The best of the compatibles handily outperform IBM's offerings.andO;And MCA compatibles offer you more growing room-more expansion slots and moredrive bays.andP;  They also offer a greater range of standard hard disks and theavailability of 5.25-inch internal floppy disk drives.andM;Certainly you have wider choices among classic-bus computers than among theseMCA compatibles.andP;  And you'll find similar offerings in the EISA camp.andP;  Whichbus to choose remains a tough question.andM;In theory, MCA has higher performance potentials than the classic AT bus andEISA, because it's not carrying the baggage of a dead bus.andP;  But anyone whoremembers the standards war between Beta and VHS videocassette recordersknows that on-paper arguments about superior technology will not guarantee awinning place in the market, particularly when the benefits are not apparentto the average user.andP;  As mentioned earlier, PC Labs recently showed thatneither EISA nor MCA will demonstrably improve a PC's performance on today'sDOS applications.andP;  From a functional standpoint, any one of the threeavailable expansion buses is acceptable right now.andP;  (See &quot;The Bus Wars: ISA'sSurprising Staying Power,&quot; PC Magazine, June 26, 1990, for a directcomparison of the three bus architectures.)andM;For the future, the call between EISA and MCA is difficult.andP;  Both buses offersimilar abilities (after all, EISA's designers borrowed the best ideas fromMCA).andP;  And the big promises of both remain unfulfilled.andM;If you want an advanced-bus PC, right now you'll find a wider choice amongMCA than EISA machines.andP;  Counting all manufacturer-designated modelvariations, 81 MCA computers with 386SX or better microprocessors had beenannounced by the time this story was written.andP;  (Seven 286 machines were alsoavailable.) By contrast, 57 models had been announced with the EISA bus, allof which had 386SX microprocessors or better.andP;  Hundreds of other models basedon the classic AT bus were available at the time.andM;Thus, your computer choice is no longer limited if you favor a particularexpansion bus.andP;  If you believe that MCA will ultimately triumph--or if youbelieve that someday you'll work with an operating system that can takeadvantage of bus mastering and other advanced features the 12 Micro ChannelPCs reviewed here offer you some excellent alternatives.andP;  Even with today'ssoftware, they will prove themselves capable performers.andP;  If you care aboutthe performance of the computer you use, if you care about multitasking, andif you care about staying abreast of technology, you'll want to consider oneof them.andM;BUS MASTERS TAKE CHARGEandM;The conventional ISA computer is essentially nothing more than amicroprocessor enhanced with incidentals like memory and an expansion bus  -apocket calculator with its wildest dreams fulfilled.andP;  In ISA computers, themicroprocessor is the all-knowing brain that controls everything and alsosets the limits.andP;  The rest of the computer can do nothing more or faster thanthe microprocessor, whose overhead constrains transfer speeds across theexpansion bus.andM;Micro Channel architecture, however, borrows a concept from mainframecomputers: The scheme turns the microprocessor and the expansion bus intoseparate subsystems, each freed from the limitations of the other.andP;  Insteadof having a single element in control, the MCA expansion bus can be commandedby any of several devices called bus masters.andP;  The bus master in charge hasan elegantly simple function; it just moves information across the expansionbus.andP;  MCA gives it free rein to do whatever it wants.andP;  The interactions amongbus masters are coordinated by special system-board circuitry known as thecentral arbitration point (or CAP).andM;A bus master owns the MCA system as long as the CAP gives it command.andO;Typically, the bus master will be a device such as a high-speed direct memoryaccess (DMA) controller, which moves bytes from one place to another withextreme dispatch.andM;Independent bus masters accelerate the performance of MCA computers inseveral ways.andP;  For one thing, they are not restricted by microprocessorperformance.andP;  The MCA specification defines data transfer rates up to 160MBper second, which is nearly three times as fast as the peak transfer rate ofa 33-MHz 80386 microprocessor with true zero-wait-state memory and no systemoverhead (that is, without certain functions that are hardly incidental, suchas memory refreshing).andM;In addition, because bus-master transfers take place without microprocessorintervention, an MCA computer with cache memory can continue working during abus-master data transfer, achieving a small degree of parallel processing.andO;Bus masters that have their own microprocessors and memory (as on acoprocessor board or an array processor) yield an even greater degree ofparallel processing, stealing only a little expansion bus time when they needto interact with other Parts of the system.andM;THE SLAVE ROLEandM;The opposite of a bus master is the bus slave.andP;  As its name would imply, theslave responds to the commands of the bus master, accepting the data the busmaster sends out or originating the data the bus master requests.andP;  The busslave functions like an ordinary expansion device (such as a video card ordrive controller) in a nonmastering computer such as an IBM PC or AT.andM;The difference between bus master and bus slave is entirely functional.andP;  Inthe MCA scheme, one bus master can take control over another, making  thesecond its slave.andP;  When a new  situation demands, the same two devices canswitch roles.andM;All expansion boarandamp; can function as bus slaves; consequently, there is nosuch thing as a special bus-slave board.andP;  Boards that cart function as busmasters are special, however, and require additional circuitry to takecommand of the system.andP;  Such expansion boards should be called bus-masteringadapters or bus-mastering boards.andM;MCA is designed to support up to 15 bus masters (not counting the computer'smicroprocessor), limited by the coding abilities of die four hardware signalsthat the CAP uses for arbitration.andP;  To take control of the MCA expansion bus,a bus master sends out special hardware commands to the CAP and the CAPresolves any conflicts between competing masters.andP;  By default, each busmaster is assigned an arbitration priority, although the MCA specificationallows these priorities to be programmed.andM;Bus masters are not just for multi-microprocessor parallel computers.andP;  Anyinput/output device can take advantage of this technology to enhanceperformance'  power, and overall throughput.andP;  For example, an intelligentbus-masftdng hard disk controller could store disk data in internal cachememory and encrypt it off-line (from the bus and host microprocesasor), inits way to or from the disk drive, providing absolute file security withminimum system overhead.andP;  The same technology could add advanced errorcorrection to disk or tape mass-storage systems.andM;A bus-mastering network adapter can free your system's microprocessor fromthe layers of protocol management because the adapter can communicatedirectly with other expansion boards in the server.andP;  Bus-masteringcommunication concentrators could likewise relieve the load on themicro-processor, supporting many types of terminals by means of in-lineprotocol conversion or emulation.andP;  Bus-mastering microprocessor upgrades canreplace the host microprocessor on the system board or operate parallel withit to improve the system's data processing capabilities.andP;  Bus-masteringdisplay systems can extract data directly from memory and assume all theresponsibility for creating a complex image.andP;  Bus-mastering technology alsolends itself to developing intelligent internal subsystems for the processingof complex mathematics, speech, or electronic vision.andP;  Unrestricted bymicroprocessor performance, bus masters increase the speed at whichinformation is transferred in MCA systems.andM;* ALR MicroFlex 3300andM;* PC386sx/MC,andM;If you're determined to have an MCA computer on your desk or use one as afile server, the ten challengers represented here give IBM a run for itsmoney.andP;  In some cases these systems exceed the abilities of the originator ofMicro Channel architecture.andP;  Most have also solved their compatibilityproblems; with the exception of Tandy and Wang, all passed our suite ofcompatibility tests.andM;Two computers deserve Editor's Choice.andP;  The 33-MHz ALR MicroFlex 3300 is thefastest and most versatile, offering the most bang for the buck in the 386category.andP;  And the NCR PC386sx/ MC[.sub.]20 represents a good value in a386SX machine, from a company with a tradition of providing admirable serviceand support.andM;The ALR MicroFlex 3300 blew away the 25-MHz MCA models in speed, and it tiesfor third place on our 80386 Instruction Mix test when compared withsimilarly equipped ISA machines (see &quot;Speed to Bum: 22 of the Fastest 386s,&quot;PC Magazine, February 13, 1990).ne computer also offers remarkable power,with such features as a 642MB hard disk and the ability to hold up to 64MB ofRAM.andP;  At a list price of $7,909 for PC Magazine's standard configuration(including 4MB RAM and a 120MB hard disk), the MicroFlex 3300 will set youback about $ 1,000 more than a typical ISA machine, but you'll be getting theassurance of a top-quality system and a company that has made a commitment toMCA.andM;NCR's PC386sx/MC[.sub.]20 is a better choice than IBM's PS/2 Model 65SX.andP;  Itoffers competitive pricing; the standard configuration costs $4,844, which is2,000 less than the similarly configured IBM.andP;  While the NCR falls a bitshort, providing only a 44MB hard disk for that price, the machine stillmakes an excellent workstation for Microsoft Windows.andP;  And thanks to NCR'sone-year on-site service policy, you'll get the kind of support you need aswell.andM;IBM's PS/2 Model 70-A21 deserves honorable mention; it comes from the companythat set the MCA standard, and with it, you should never have to worry aboutcompatibility issues.andP;  It's a good performer (though by no means the fasteston our list), and is widely distributed--often at deep discounts-and widelysupported.andP;  Its case construction also deserves recognition, but thesmall-footprint design limits the machine's usefulness as a file server.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
