In addition, staff is responding to tariffformat issues raised at the Order No. 493 implementation conference onFebruary 1 and 2, 1989. Technical revisions for tariff filings are describedin Appendix A. Staff's response to comments on the certificate record formatsand a description of the revisions to those formats are included in AppendixB. Staff is also releasing with this notice the recommended hard copy filingformats for a certificate filing and sample tariff sheet print formatsusing various print pitch and line densities. The record formats for certificate filings are intended to standardizethe electronic format in which certain data included in a certificate filingare reported to the Commission. The record formats are structured to encompassmost of the data which staff frequently requires in supplemental data requests.However, there is no change in the regulations identifying the contentsof a certificate filing. There is also no intent to require companies tofile more information than they have previously been required to submitor to alter the timeframe in which certain information is submitted tothe Commission. Companies may report data in more or less detail than specifiedin the record formats, as appropriate to support their applications. Information in a certificate filing will be submitted in three files: Afile containing only structured data (FILE1), a second file containingall of the footnotes to the structured data (FILE2), and a third file consistingof free form text records, header records and trailer records (FILE3).Using the revised file structure, a company may elect to display a particularstatement or schedule in the Commission-specified format or substituteits own free form display in FILE3. However, the formatted data in FILE1and the accompanying footnotes in FILE2 on the electronic medium must beprovided in either case. The revised structure also enables footnotes tobe printed with the applicable statement or schedule instead of at theend of the hard copy. The General Instructions for the certificate filingrecord formats contain a more detailed description of the new method forsubmitting data on an electronic medium. In addition to publishing the text of this notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, the Commission also provides all interestedpersons an opportunity to inspect or copy the contents of this notice,the associated record formats and the hard copy filing formats, duringnormal business hours in Room 1000 at the Commission's headquarters, 825North Capitol Street, NE., Washington, DC 20426. This notice is also available through the Commission Issuance Posting System(CIPS), an electronic bulletin board service that provides access to formaldocuments issued by the Commission. CIPS is available at no charge to theuser and may be accessed on a 24-hour basis using a personal computer witha modem by dialing (202) 357-8997. To access CIPS, set your communicationssoftware to use 300, 1200 or 2400 baud, full duplex, no parity, eight databits and one stop bit. The text of the notice will be available on CIPSfor 30 days from the date of issuance. Due to the size of the record format and hard copy print format files,the formats will not be available through CIPS. However, the revised recordformats and hard copy formats are available (1) on a single 5.25andmin16;andmin16;(1.2MB) or 3.5andmin16;andmin16; (1.44MB) double-sided, high density diskettein ASCII text file format, or (2) on paper (124 pages for certificates;38 pages for tariffs). The diskettes and/or paper copy may be purchasedfrom the Commission's copy contractor, La Dorn Systems Corp., located inRoom 1000, 825 North Capitol Street NE., Washington, DC 20426.

Watson, Jr., </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Acting Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A_Revisions to Tariff Filing Formats </ITAG>The record formats for tariff sheets have not been significantly revised.The formats and instructions issued with this notice clarify the characterand line limits for tariff pages and specify certain abbreviations to beused, if necessary, for tariff sheet identification. After further review, staff has determined that tariff sheets must be printedat 10, 12, 15 or 17 characters per inch pitch. Sheets that are createdusing other than the specified print pitches (e.g., 16.6) will defaultto the next highest density for printing purposes. For readability considerations,print pitches greater than 17 cpi will not be accepted. Tariff sheets mustbe printed at a line density of either six or eight lines per inch. Thesespecifications result in the following characters/line and lines/inch limits:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,tp0,i1,s25,6,6,6,6,6,6 </C>  <H1>Page orientation</H1><H1>Max. line length (characters)</H1><H2>10 cpi</H2><H2>12 cpi</H2><H2>15 cpi</H2><H2>17 cpi</H2><H1>Maximum lines per page</H1><H2>6 lpi</H2><H2>8 lpi</H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Portrait<D> 65</D><D> 79</D><D> 98</D><D> 112</D><D> 50</D><D> 70 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Landscape<D> 98</D><D> 118</D><D> 148</D><D> 168</D><D> 31</D><D> 44</D></ITAG></ITAG> Commenters have stated that sheet identification will require more thanthe 40 characters specified for both the Sheet ID and Superseded SheetID. These field lengths are limited by the number of characters that canbe printed in the top margin in the format specified in the Commission'sregulations. Therefore, staff has adopted abbreviation conventions thatshould be used when non-abbreviated sheet identification requires morethan 40 characters. The standard abbreviations include:<ITAG tagnum="15">Substitute: Sub </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Alternate: Alt </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Revised: / </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">First, Second, etc.: 1, 2, etc. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Sheet No.: (omit these words)</ITAG>There are no abbreviations specified for ``Original'' and ``Replacement''.For original sheet identification, there should be little need for abbreviation.Staff prefers that the term ``Substitute'' be used in lieu of ``Replacement''.<ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix B_Reply Comments of the Commission Staff to Comments FiledPursuant to March 29, 1989, Certificate Formats, Docket No. RM87-17-000</ITAG>Introduction Ten interstate pipelines and one association filed comments in responseto the certificate filing formats issued March 29, 1989. The commentersare: Northwest Pipeline Corporation, United Gas Pipe Line Company, TexasEastern Transmission Corporation, Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, TexasGas Transmission Corporation, Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation, EnronInterstate Pipelines, Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company, El PasoNatural Gas Company, Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America, and the InterstateNatural Gas Association of America. Commenters offered several suggestions that, where possible, have beenadopted. The most significant change is a reduction in the number of recordformats for Exhibit K. These changes have necessitated a renumbering ofthe record and item numbers. Item numbers in this appendix, unless otherwiseindicated, are the item numbers associated with these final formats. The comments focused on the following areas: 1. Record CA/03, and Exhibits F andamp; G, all of which are related to theEnvironmental Report. 2. Records CA/04, 05, 06, 07, and 08, all of which are related to gas supplyand market data, and; 3. Records CA/09 through CA/13, all related to facilities data in ExhibitK. The general concern of the commenters in all three of these areas is thatthe Commission has designed record formats that go beyond what the regulationsspecifically require to be filed in a certificate application or an abbreviatedapplication. The Commission staff has frequently issued formal data requests and deficiencyletters to applicants in order to obtain additional information on applications.These requests and letters have been issued in both simple and complexproceedings. In more complex cases, there may be many formal requests duringthe course of the proceeding, not including informal data requests, evenin most routine cases. The Commission staff has broad authority under andSection;andSection;157.8 and 157.14(c) of the regulations to request this additional information.In an effort to lessen the instances where deficient applications are filedand to minimize the number of formal and informal data requests for informationrequired in its analysis of an application, staff has designed a comprehensivestructure for filing applications of all types. The formats maintain theflexibility of each applicant to determine the information it believesis necessary to insert in those filings. The Commission staff has addedcertain information to these structured records that it usually requestswhen the application involves certification of facilities and expansioninto new or existing markets. However, there is no change in the regulations identifying the contentsof a certificate filing. There is also no intent to require companies tofile more information than they have previously been required to submitor to alter the timeframe in which certain information is submitted tothe Commission. Applicants may report data in more or less detail thanspecified in the record formats, as appropriate to support an application.General Information Almost all of the commenters stated their concern that it will be onerousto submit executed service agreements for transportation services pursuantto andSection; 284.223(b) on electronic media. While the service agreementitself is approximately five pages in length, the attachments indicatingall of the possible receipt and delivery points can be several hundredpages in length. Staff agrees that executed service agreements pursuantto andSection; 284.223(b) should not be required on electronic media andis clarifying the filing instructions accordingly. Refer to General Instruction8. <T3>Pro forma </T3>tariff sheets included in an application pursuant toandSection; 157.14(a)(18)(i)(b) also will not be required on electronic media.These tariff sheets will not be part of the Commission's electronic tariffsystem. If changes to a pipeline's tariff are made necessary by the grantingof a certificate, then the proposed tariff sheets will be filed on electronicmedia when the pipeline makes a separate tariff filing. These revisionsare now reflected in formats under General Information, Part III(b).A new sentence has been added to the end of General Information Part III(f) which states: ``If these procedures are not adhered to, the filingwill not be accepted.'' A new subparagraph has been added to Part III (f) which reads:<ITAG tagnum="21">The tape reel, cartridge, or diskette(s) must have a sticky labelaffixed indicating the company name and type of filing. Do not attach staples,paper clips, alligator clips, etc., to the electronic medium. </ITAG>General Instructions 1. Several commenters noted that the certificate filing formats do notallow flexibility to insert nonstandard information in lieu of the requiredstructured data records. This instruction specifically states that thestructured data records are placed in FILE1. Footnotes to the structureddata records are included in FILE2. Standard Header Record CA/l2 (old recordCA/15) is used in FILE3 if information from the appropriate records inFILE1 and FILE2 is to be printed in the standard FERC hard copy reportformat. Alternatively, records CA/13 and CA/14 (old records CA/16 and CA/17) areto be used in FILE3 if the applicant desires to insert text or use a nonstandardreport format in the hard copy report. The text or nonstandard report recordsare inserted between the header and trailer records. When the print softwareencounters a Record CA/13, the program will print all records followingthe header record and preceding the trailer record. The information inFILE1 and FILE2, although still required to be included on electronic media,will not be used for print purposes. To add further flexibility as requested by several of the commenters, ExhibitC now contains codes for those exhibits excluded from the requirementsfor electronically filed data. This will give the applicant the optionof inserting nonstandard text or data in FILE3 that it believes is necessaryto accompany and further explain the exhibits not required to be filedon electronic media. Also, additional text, data, or any other miscellaneous information maybe inserted using Records CA/13 and CA/14 and Regulation Section Code 127from Exhibit C for andSection; 157.14(b), ``Additional Exhibits.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">8. Executed Contract Text </ITAG>This instruction caused a great deal of confusion and it is now modifiedto state that executed service agreements related to prior notice filingspursuant to Order No. 500, because of their size, do not have to be submittedon electronic media. <ITAG tagnum="81">12. Record Lengths </ITAG>The standard record length has been changed from 240 to 255 bytes. Thisis consistent with the maximum record length used for other filings requiredon electronic media. However, none of the record formats for certificatefilings require more than 240 characters. <ITAG tagnum="81">13. Pipeline Facility/Segment Number </ITAG>This instruction has been renamed and modified to indicate that the firstsegment or facility in a project or projects is to be Number 1 and so onin sequence, regardless of the number of the project(s). <ITAG tagnum="81">14. Mile Post </ITAG>Since there is bi-directional flow on many pipelines depending upon theseason, the phrase ``in the direction of gas flow'' is deleted. <ITAG tagnum="81">16. Year Reported </ITAG>In order to provide more flexibility, this instruction is modified to givethe applicant the option of using another basis for determining a twelve-monthperiod other than the current instruction of November 1 through October31. This will be accomplished by use of a footnote on Record CA/01 item14. The footnote should also define the basis and the parameters of theweather patterns used in making the forecasts. <ITAG tagnum="81">17. Winter Period Volume </ITAG>The same flexibility will be given to the applicant as in No. 16 above,with the footnote appearing on the appropriate record(s).<ITAG tagnum="81">18. Summer Period Volume </ITAG>See Nos. 16 and 17 above. <ITAG tagnum="81">20. Corrections to Errors in Filings </ITAG>This instruction pertains only to errors in filings. If an amendment isfiled, it should include all the information which is new or revised fromthe original filing and should by reference include that information fromthe initial filing that is pertinent, utilizing different file names thanthe initial filing. Supplements to an application or responses to data requests should be filedon the enclosed formats, both standard and nonstandard, utilizing differentfilenames than the initial filing. <ITAG tagnum="81">23. Records Required </ITAG>This is a new title for this instruction. Apparently, there is some confusionwith regard to the records that are required with each type of application.This instruction is modified to show that Record CA/02 is generally notrequired for applications requesting certification of facilities relatedto system supply, relocation of facilities, or replacement of facilities(that result in no change to existing customer services). The instruction is also clarified to indicate that the receipt and deliverypoints required in Schedule 2 of the hard copy format are not just thosepoints that are to be constructed but all points that are affected by theservices for which certification is sought. If the application is a priornotice filing, Schedule 2 is not required and the receipt and deliverypoint information that is part of the service agreement will be providedin hard copy only as noted in General Instruction 8. These structured formats standardize certain significant portions of theexhibits required in certificate filings and other information usuallyrequested by the Commission staff in formal data requests. The formatsare not meant to be a complete replacement or substitute for specific exhibitsor portions of a certificate application. The applicant has always hadto decide how to comply with the regulations regarding the informationand the amount of detail required to submit a complete application. Theregulations for abbreviated applications (andSection; 157.7) have not beenchanged. The applicant therefore still has the same flexibility as in thepast to include that information which it believes is necessary to submita complete filing. <ITAG tagnum="81">24. Exhibit K, Schedule Records CA/09 and CA/10 </ITAG>This is a new instruction that clarifies the relationship between ExhibitK and the regulations regarding abandonment (andSection; 157.18) that donot require an Exhibit K. Several commenters suggested that old Records CA/09 through CA/13 did notcapture all the data for Exhibit K as required by the regulations. Basedupon these suggestions and with additional input from staff, the five recordformats for Exhibit K have been reduced to two record formats which nowcontain what the regulations require. This includes certain detailed costinformation normally requested by the staff in filings with significantfacilities. The specific changes to Records CA/09 and CA/10 will be discussedbelow in more detail. These new records are also modified to solve a dilemma addressed by severalof the commenters regarding the Exhibit K records when there is a jointapplication or an application that involves more than one project by thesame applicant (some commenters consider a single segment or a series ofsegments as one project and another group of segments or equipment as asecond project). This will be resolved by inserting a new item, ``ProjectNumber'', on these records. <ITAG tagnum="81">25. Joint Applications </ITAG>This is a new instruction to clarify a situation that does not occur veryoften, but can be complex in a structured format.Schedule Records <ITAG tagnum="81">Schedule/Record CA/01 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Item 1 Company ID </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">If company is a new entity, leave blank.

We do not believea change is necessary. If the Commission's regulations are revised in thefuture to require additional types of applications or filings on electronicmedia, revisions to the record formats will be made at that time. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">Schedule/Record CA/02 </ITAG>A new Note is inserted at the top of this record indicating how this recordis to be used. Also several commenters requested that a new ``code=8, none''be added to Item 16, Type of Customer/Shipper. This is unnecessary sincethis record need not be completed if the application does not propose anynew or revised services for any customers. This could occur if the applicationproposes new facilities for system supply, relocations or replacements.<ITAG tagnum="16">Item 22 Term of Service </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Old Item 21.

In the past the Commission Staff has requested gas supplyinformation on a monthly basis. However, we have recently found that seasonaldata is more meaningful for the types of analyses being undertaken today.Using seasonal data rather than monthly data will reduce the amount ofdata required and thus reduce some of the burden on the industry.

The industry is still undergoinggreat changes due to a more competitive marketplace and constant restructuringof supply contracts and pricing. <ITAG tagnum="14">This flexible standard has likewise given a pipeline greater flexibilityin preparing its certificate applications such that, depending upon itssources of supply, its acquisition program, the size and scope of the servicesto be rendered, the number of customers involved, and the comparative natureof the applicant's filing to other applications proposing the same services,pipelines have submitted gas supply information to the Commission on aroutine basis for periods ranging from three to ten years. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="14">Therefore, Records CA/04 through CA/08 have been devised to createa 10-year report (3 actual and 7 projected).

This has necessitated a renumberingof several of these codes. Also, Record CA/05, the applicant's system marketdata required in Exhibit I (andSection; 157.14(a)(11)), is moved in orderto print that data in conjunction with Record CA/04, the supply informationrequired in Exhibit H (andSection; 157.14(a)(10)). <ITAG tagnum="81">Exhibit D </ITAG> No changes.<ITAG tagnum="81">Exhibit E </ITAG>No changes. <ITAG tagnum="81">Exhibit F </ITAG>Many comments, both general and specific, were received concerning thisexhibit and Exhibit G, both of which pertain to the environmental aspectsof an application. All comments have been noted and specific comments willbe addressed under the factors to which they apply. In general, a greatdeal of concern has been generated by the apparent misunderstanding thatall environmental data and information is required at the time of filingin order to be in compliance with the requirements of the regulations.While this is true in theory, it has been observed in practice that applicantsalmost always initially file less than is required by the staff and theregulations to fully analyze the environmental aspects of an application.This has necessitated voluminous data requests to the applicant throughoutthe processing of an application, and has lengthened the review period.The information required in Record CA/03 and the accompanying instructionsin this Exhibit F is information that staff has historically requestedapplicants to provide. As discussed below, Record CA/03 has been made moreflexible to accommodate some of the concerns of the commenters. Staff understands that not all necessary data can be obtained at the timeof filing. For this reason, staff has included a new code=3 under ``Item30_Factor Impact'' on Record CA/03, to indicate that the impact of a factoris undetermined at the time of filing. This will allow the applicant toforego the submission of certain data that can later be filed as a supplementin the same format. However, applicants should be aware that the more informationand data that is available to the staff at the time of initial filing,the quicker staff can analyze the application since fewer data requeststo the applicant will be required. Code=3, ``Impact undetermined at time of filing, will provide as soon aspossible'', should be used when information and data are legitimately notavailable. For example, much of the information requested in Record CA/03may be determined from maps and aerial photography, as built drawings forlooping projects, and consultations with the appropriate federal, state,and local authorities. To the extent that the pipeline route and the affectedareas of impact are modified subsequent to the initial filing, such information,as it becomes available, should be filed as a supplement in the structuredformat of Record CA/03. Commenters also argued that the accuracy of 0.05 mile (264 feet) requiredin Record CA/03, Item 34, is too refined, especially in submitting informationin the initial filing. Staff realizes, as commenters have noted, that thefinal route of a pipeline may vary considerably from the route that isinitially filed; however, the final route should not vary considerablyfrom the route studied by staff under NEPA, except as modified by certificateconditions. The 0.05 mile is based on the filed route. Since an applicantis requested to file its route on USGS 7.5 minute topographical maps, theapplicant should experience little difficulty in measuring mile posts tothis precision (approximately \3/16\ of an inch on a 7.5 minute scale)with respect to the proposed alignment. While the surveyed route may bedifferent, it will certainly yield mile post locations with greater precision,which must be reported when available. The following comments are factor specific with regard to Exhibit F: <ITAG tagnum="81">Factor Number </ITAG>1. Staff is concerned with the short-term turbidity and its effects onwater supplies caused during actual instream construction. At this timethe sediment plume can extend further than one mile downstream and somewater systems may not have alternative water source or stream intake. Duringconstruction and depending on certain conditions, water quality, <T3>i.e.</T3>, turbidity, can be affected further than 3 miles. 2. The applicant should provide the location of identified municipal watersheds,and the sites where construction would cross an area such as watershedsfor reservoirs, well fields or a well recharge area. 3. Staff is seeking information from the applicant on streams already identifiedby the various appropriate regulatory agencies as being contaminated. 4. As specified in Report 2 of Exhibit G on Water Use and Quality, theapplication, and therefore the spreadsheet, must discuss perennial streams.9. Use the best available information if National Wetland Inventory mapsare not available for a specific area. 10. See 9 above. 16. We agree. This information would require consultation with the U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service. 17. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designates both Federal threatenedand endangered species (proposed and listed) and their critical habitats.18. These locations should be determined as close as possible in consultationwith state and local authorities. A code 3 can be utilized in the initialfiling until this information becomes available and can be submitted ina supplemental filing. 19. This information is readily available from existing information andfrom the State Historic Preservation Officers in each state, or needs tobe determined as a result of a survey. 20. See discussion in 19 above. 21. See discussion in 19 above. 22. See discussion above regarding new code on CA/03. 23. See 22 above; surveys may be required. 24. Information on known active faults is readily available. 30. Slopes can be determined from topo sheets and maps and soil types cangenerally be ascertained from general county soil maps or consultationswith the Soil Conservation Service (SCS). 31. See 30 above. 32. The applicant can show in the resource report section of its exhibitthat portion of the site to be converted to non-farm use. However, thisis best shown on a map indicating soil series and the location of the applicant'sfacilities. It is necessary for staff to have an understanding of the characteristicsof the entire site. While staff acknowledges that much of the site mayremain undeveloped, the entire site must be studied. Many times, primefarmland is also the best site for an aboveground facility. 35. The staff routinely requests this information in response to many pastconcerns raised during the analysis of a project. A discussion of the informationgathered appears in every environmental document published by the Commission'sOffice of Pipeline and Producer Regulation. 37. See discussion for factor 35 above. 52. See discussion for factor 35 above. 53. This information is readily available. 63. The definition is revised to: 55 dBa ``<T3>or more stringent state or local values.</T3>'' <ITAG tagnum="81">Exhibit G </ITAG>The information required by Part 380 of the regulations regarding an environmentalreport has been structured into twelve resource reports by the staff. Thishas resulted in a more usable format that logically arranges the detailedinformation required by the regulations for the staff in publishing itsenvironmental documents. The use of this preferred format to obtain the necessary information forthe environmental report as required by the regulations is optional, andthe applicant may still file utilizing the structure for the report asrequired by Part 380. However, it the applicant chooses to use the preferredformat as shown in this exhibit, this format will allow the staff to savevaluable time in structuring the required information, preparing an analysis,and subsequently, issuing its environmental document. Further, staff recognizes that some information required in the EnvironmentalReport may not be available to the applicant at the time of the initialfiling, and that this information will have to be submitted in supplementalfilings prior to any certification. However, this information should befiled in the preferred format in order to expedite the processing of theapplicant's filing. The Commission has primary NEPA responsibility for interstate gas transmissionfacilities. To the extent that other agencies are involved, the certificategranted by the Commission to the applicant is the authorizing action uponwhich an applicant may proceed with its construction of facilities or otheractivities granted by the certificate.The following comments are directed specifically to each report dependingon the issues raised by the commenters. <ITAG tagnum="81">Report Number </ITAG>1. The instructions state that aerial photographic maps shall be provided``when available.'' With respect to nonjurisdictional facilities as (f) and (g), the staffmust analyze the entire project including nonjurisdictional facilitiesand report on the probable impacts. In addition, under the Threatened andEndangered Species Act, as amended, and the National Historic PreservationAct, staff must examine the impact that the <T3>entire</T3> project, both jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional, mighthave on threatened and endangered species and cultural resources. 2. As discussed above, where wetland maps are unavailable, use the bestavailable information. If the surface of the land is to be disturbed, the activity has the potentialto affect water quality in the area. 3. See discussion under 2 above. Any activity, whether on existing or expandedright of way, has the potential to impact biological resources. It is theburden of the applicant to show why there would not be adverse impacts.4. See discussion under 1, 2 and 3 above for the same reasons. 5. This report is required only for new major aboveground facilities suchas compressor stations, LNG facilities and large aboveground nonjurisdictionalfacilities directly connected to the applicant's proposed project (suchas power plants or cogeneration facilities, etc.). 6. See discussion under 1, 2 and 3 above for the same reasons. 7. See discussion under 1, 2 and 3 above for the same reasons. Also, seediscussion under factor number 32. 8. The staff must be able to analyze all existing land uses in the vicinityof a proposed project. Identification of these areas including storageand production areas is required in order for staff to perform a completeassessment. With regard to part (d) of this report, staff realizes that specific detailswith respect to compensation may not be resolved and therefore, seeks generalinformation and descriptions as to how the value of the right of way isdetermined, who determines it, and how damages might be determined. Likewise,a concise description of the eminent domain process in the project areashould be supplied using the same guidelines. As a general rule however, such information regarding compensation is notconfidential and may be requested in certain cases. 9. Since there are many times that equipment parameters can be providedto the Commission prior to the time that state permit applications arefiled, the information requested is still valid and has not been changed.Waiting for state permits could delay processing by the Commission. 12. In (a), the reference to (ii)(a-k) is revised to (b)(i-xvi). In (b)(iv),``cut'' surfaces means ``pipe cuts.'' Further, staff is responsible for formally transmitting the informationrequired in this report to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) underthe September 17, 1987 letter of agreement. If an EPA approved plan hasalready been obtained by the applicant, a copy should be provided to theCommission. If this report does not apply to the applicant or the project,it is not required to be filed. <ITAG tagnum="81">Exhibit H </ITAG>Other than the changes already described above, the only significant changeto the hard copy reports are those made to capture most of the significantphysical, locational, and cost factors required by Exhibit K. One commenter suggests that the 16.6 characters per inch (cpi) pitch andmargin settings of 5 and 175 respectively, for the landscape reports inthis exhibit are in excess of industry standards. The commenter recommendsthat hard copy reports be limited to print lines of 80 cpi for portraitand 132 cpi for landscape. While these print lines have been widely used,they were for a time one of the limiting factors for a typical mainframeline printer. However, laser printers have greater flexibility to compresscharacters than was possible utilizing older printers. Staff reiterates that the hard copy report formats in this exhibit areoptional. An applicant may utilize a different format for printing thestructured data. However, the applicant must still submit the requireddata in the structured data formats of Records CA/01 through CA/11.<ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-13999 Filed 6-12-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6717-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
