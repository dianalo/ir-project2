A strike by the airline's largest union would bring to a head long-simmering labor tensions at the nation's fifth-largest airline. Although it has been a year and a half since Northwest merged with Republic Airlines, Northwest has failed to negotiate combined contracts for the two groups of employees or to settle bitter disputes over vast salary discrepancies between them.    The Teamsters union, which represents the flight attendants, said that it will meet with Northwest management and a National Mediation Board representative today and that it expects to hold bargaining sessions up until the strike deadline of 12:01 a.m. CST Saturday. &quot;We're not optimistic,&quot; a union spokesman said.    A spokesman for Northwest, a unit of St. Paul, Minn.-based NWA Inc., said the company was encouraged by the prospect of new negotiations. &quot;Traditionally, the flight attendants have gone to the wire in their negotiations,&quot; the spokesman said. The airline has said it is prepared to staff its aircraft with managers who have undergone flight attendant training in the event of a strike.    The company also has stepped up recruitment of new flight attendants, but denies the action is related to labor unrest.    So far, none of the airline's other unions have agreed to support the attendants. Support is most likely to come from the Northwest chapter of the International Association of Machinists, who have been without a contract since the merger in October 1986. The Machinists recently won a suit preventing Northwest from unilaterally imposing a new contract on 2,900 former Republic mechanics and ground handlers.    The flight attendants say they also expect Teamsters locals representing drivers who deliver food and fuel to Northwest aircraft to participate in the strike.    The Teamsters said the flight attendants are opposed to company proposals to replace senior flight attendants on trans-Pacific flights with new, lower-paid bilingual employees; to replace the former Republic retirement plan with one the flight attendants say is less beneficial; and to require employees receiving so-called B-scale wages to wait nine years instead of six to qualify for A-scale salaries.    To some extent, Northwest management has benefited from friction between its two groups of flight attendants. The former Republic flight attendants recently won a suit to have their representatives reinstated to the union's contract negotiation team, after the representatives were dismissed by their fellow Northwest attendants. But recent moves by the company, including a rule reducing from three to two the number of attendants aboard DC-9 aircraft, have solidified the two groups. The union said more than 94% of its members voted for the strike measure. </TEXT></DOC>
