(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of tons of french fries, hashbrowns and potato puffs destined for fast-food chains wereimpounded by a food processing company after pieces of wire werefound in them.   Metal-laden potato products mysteriously began appearing atLamb-Weston Inc.'s Hermiston plant June 4, said Steven Johnson, theplant's former quality assurance manager.   ``It looks like wire from a wire brush that you use to scrapepaint off or something,'' Johnson said in a telephone interview.``And we found this wire embedded in the french fry after it hadbeen processed. These wires had kicked off the metal detectors.''   The potatoes were being processed for fast food restaurants inthe U.S. and Japan, but none ever reached consumers, according to astate Agriculture Department official.   Most of the impounded potato products never left the plant, butwere stored in a refrigerated warehouse, The Wall Street Journalreported. The paper said about 100 cases of hash browns were sentto McDonald's distribution centers, but were located and returnedunused to the plant.   At Lamb-Weston's parent company, ConAgra of Omaha, Neb.,spokesman Walt Casey said Lamb-Weston impounded the potatoes,``they notified the FDA, and they worked with the FDA in resolvingthe problem.''   But a state official said the Oregon manufacturer of the spikedspuds failed to notify state inspectors of the problem.   James Black, administrator of the food and dairy division of thestate Agriculture Department, said the only notification was ananonymous tip to a state field assistant on vacation in theHermiston area.   Black said the state Agriculture Department is responsible forinspecting plants in the state. He said the federal Food and DrugAdministration doesn't get involved unless the product is shippedout of state.   Johnson said at least 18 million pounds of potato products wereaffected between June 4 and June 27, when he was fired.   ``We run close to a million pounds a day,'' he said. ``It was alot of metal in a lot of french fries. ... We had 30 cases of metalkicked off on the metal detectors.''   Johnson said he discovered the wire June 15 and tried to trackthe source until he and six other employees were fired because ofthe problem. He did not elaborate on the firings and the companyrefused to discuss them.   Black said he did not know whether plant officials had isolatedthe source of the problem. Johnson said he initially thought a wirebrush might have been caught in a water pump feeding the flume, awater-filled chute that moves the potatoes into the processing areafrom the receiving area, but none was found.</TEXT></DOC>
