HOSTETLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal judge has dismissed chargesholding Unisys Corp. responsible for a predecessor's actions butretained the case against the original firm, Sperry Corp., and aretired Air Force colonel, according to documents filed Tuesday.   The charges against Unisys were dismissed by the U.S. DistrictCourt in Montgomery, Ala., Dec. 29, two months after Unisys andSperry were indicted.   The government alleged the former Sperry Federal InformationSystems Division had falsely billed the government for $501,600 forwork that was never performed as part of a eight-year, $526 millioncontract to modernize the Air Force's computer network.   U.S. District Judge Joel Dubina left intact the indictmentagainst Sperry and retired Ar Force Col. Robert L. Hedges, 51, ofMontgomery, who oversaw the computer project for the Air Forcebefore his retirement in 1984.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Al Agricola said federal prosecutors wereunsure how to prosecute Sperry because the company no longer exists,having been absorbed in a 1986 merger with Burroughs Corp.   The court noted that although Unisys will not be held liable forSperry's actions, the company may have to pay fines.   Hedges is charged with negotiating a consulting job with Sperrywhile he was overseeing the contract from Gunter Air Force Base inMontgomery, according to U.S. Attorney Jim Wilson.   Hedges, who was under contract to Unisys at the time of theindictment, is no longer employed by the company, according tocompany officials.   Unisys spokeswoman Charlotte LeGates said the corporation was``gratified that the court confirmed the important distinctionbetween Unisys and a predecessor company in connection with eventsthat preceded the merger.''   A copy of the court's opinion dismissing the Unisys charges wasfiled Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, accordingto LeGates.   ``In this case, Unisys Corp., which was not even formed untilover two years after the alleged criminal conduct, could not beculpable therefore and, thus, should not be held criminallyliable,'' the judge ruled.   The judge said Sperry was incorporated in Delaware and, under thelaws of that state, Sperry ``would survive the merger for purposesof pending criminal actions.''   LeGates said company officials were unclear as to the amount offines and whether Unisys would have to pay a fine levied againstSperry.   She said Unisys would continue to contest the federal charges,but Rod Nachman, a Montgomery attorney representing Unisys, saidDubina's order closes the case as far as his client.   Agricola said the statute of limitations has expired in the caseand no new indictments can be issued. He said Sperry has not beenarraigned and no trial date has been set.</TEXT></DOC>
