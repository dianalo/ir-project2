Although Jepsen has three years left on a guaranteed contract worth$2 million total, putting him on the injured list might not be a ploy. TheWarriors may waive him when he recovers as a favor to him. He needs to playsomewhere, and it won't be with the Warriors.; TOLBERT AILING: This has been atrying off-season for Tom Tolbert. He hurt his back in the first Los AngelesSummer Pro League game in which he appeared. Now he has a sinus infection.;  Tolbert is with the Warriors on the trip but doesn't expect to play much inthe thin air of the Mile High City.; ETC.: The addition of center DikembeMutombo has led Nuggets Coach Paul Westhead to slow his pell-mell attack. Lastseason, the Nuggets used the offense Westhead had used at Loyola Marymount.They scored 119.9 points per game and gave up 130.8, both league highs, on theway to an NBA-worst 20-62 record. In the preseason, the Nuggets scaled downthe numbers. They've averaged 103.5 points to their opponents' 114.9. . . .The Nuggets were down to 11 players, one under the limit, leaving room forfirst-round pick Mark Macon, who is expected to sign soon, perhaps as early astoday. . . . Last season, the Warriors opened the season in Denver by beatingthe Nuggets 162-158, the highest-scoring non-overtime game in NBA history.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  RON BERGMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Denver  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911101  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  328  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, November 1, 199100306241,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
