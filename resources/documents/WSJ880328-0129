The international gold standard from the late 1870s, when the U.S. went back on gold after the Civil War, to August 1914 is the best example we have. No exchange controls impeded gross flows of financial capital -- unlike the Bretton Woods System of pegged exchange rates in the 1950s and 1960s or the residual controls of today's European Monetary System. Moreover, net transfers of capital among countries were huge: large trade surpluses (or deficits) opened and closed continually with no significant exchange-rate changes. World trade grew rapidly.    Nevertheless, fixed exchange rates in general, and the gold standard in particular, remain as unpopular among American economists today as they were with the populists who almost succeeded in electing William Jennings Bryan president in 1896. From 1873 on, America's acquiesence to the discipline of the gold standard and to the British dominance of the international capital market was always somewhat grudging. Even the formation of the Federal Reserve System in 1913 was an attempt to make American control over domestic money and credit somewhat more independent of international influences.    But this aversion to fixed exchange rates, and subsequent refusal to bend American policy toward maintaining a common international monetary standard, reflects, in part, a misassessment of the late-19th-century experience. How well the process of balancing payments among countries actually worked when exchange rates were fixed and capital markets were integrated has not been sufficently distinguished from systemwide instability associated with gold itself.    As in 1913, private capital flows among the principal industrial economies are now huge relative to official reserves and to the underlying flow of commodity trade. Thus, to stabilize exchange rates, governments must harness the self-interest of international investors. But can these gimlet-eyed speculators be convinced that today's exchange rate will remain virtually unchanged 10 years from now?    Only if participating national governments follow essentially the same monetary policy: each country's price level (in tradable goods) remains aligned with its neighbor's. And therein lay the great achievement of the late-19th-century system. Each government effectively committed itself to adjust its national supply of credit money -- bank notes and deposits -- to maintain its official gold parity. Because international investors knew this with confidence, the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar, for example, held within a narrow range of about $4.80 and $4.90 per pound for more than 30 years -- with little official intervention needed in the foreign exchanges or even in the market for gold.    Because exchange rates were securely fixed, the strength of international arbitrage in markets for tradable goods was remarkable. The table shows that the wholesale price levels of the U.S., Britain, Germany and France fell in parallel by the order of 40% to 50% from 1873 to 1896, and then rose by a similar amount from 1896 to 1913. And the prices of individual commodities were aligned internationally about as well as among different regions within the same country.    Thus, in the late 19th century, the &quot;world&quot; economy was successfully unified in two important respects:   First, any one national currency had about the same real purchasing power in domestic markets for tradable commodities as it did abroad -- there was purchasing-power parity. Trade was more efficient because merchants could more easily identify which country would be the low-cost supplier of any one product -- in contrast to the 1970s and 1980s when exchange rates among Japan, Europe and the U.S. fluctuated wildly.    Second, the international capital market was properly integrated. Because of the absence of exchange risk, nominal interest rates were -- by modern standards -- both low and uniform across countries. For example, from 1900 to 1913 the yield on U.S. railway bonds averaged about 4.1%, with the range of variation less than a percentage point; whereas similar British long-term securities yielded a bit less than 4%. Because price inflation in the two countries was also similar, real rates of return were virtually equalized.    (In the 1980s by contrast, the more or less continual expectation of dollar depreciation in the foreign exchanges contributed to the very high interest rates -- and great volatility in the cost of capital -- facing American firms in comparison with their Japanese and German rivals.)    With changes in relative national price levels -- that is, changes in real exchange rates -- thus restricted, how was capital transferred from Europe to the Americas from the 1870s to 1913? Neither internal price rises nor exchange-rate appreciation in the recipient countries was required to generate trade deficits in those nations to correspond with their capital inflow -- unlike what traditional theory might hold.    By the late 19th century, a large and sophisticated international capital market centered in London had developed. Through modest changes in relative interest rates, expenditure patterns across countries were coordinated to match trade surpluses with net capital flows so that little net gold movement -- let alone changes in exchange rates -- was necessary.    Consider the flotation of a large new issue of American railway bonds in the 19th-century London capital market. British saving that otherwise would have gone toward domestic investment would now ultimately be diverted to support a higher-yielding venture, the U.S. railways. As British domestic expenditures declined and American increased, Britain would develop a trade surplus with the U.S. But how would the international accounts be balanced before that surplus caught up with the long-term capital outflow to the U.S.? Did large quantities of gold suddenly flow out of Britain and into the U.S., thus wreaking monetary havoc in both?    Fortunately, no. Insofar as the British trade surplus initially fell short of the total proceeds from the issue of railway bonds, an offsetting inflow of short-term capital to London balanced international payments. With exchange rates credibly fixed, only slight British gold losses were necessary to increase British short-term interest rates sufficiently -- say, less than 50 basis points -- to keep the funds on deposit in London until gradually disbursed to finance the evolving U.S. trade deficit.    This transfer problem is of more than historical interest. One common justification for floating exchange rates, cited by Jacob Frenkel, is to provide greater flexiblity in allowing the prices of goods and services of country A to vary collectively vis-a-vis those in country B to facilitate trade balances adjusting to net capital flows. In modern industrial economies, the invoice prices of domestic services and tradable manufactures, which are largely brand-specific, are quite rigid or &quot;sticky&quot; in the currency of the country where they originate. Consequently, when the U.S. dollar suddenly rose about 40% from 1980 through early 1985 against European currencies and the Japanese yen, the overall American price level rose far above its European and Japanese counterparts.    Martin Feldstein, then chairman of the U.S. Council of Economic Advisors, justified this sudden loss of international competitiveness as being necessary for the American economy to absorb capital from abroad -- to develop a net trade deficit that covered the emerging U.S. fiscal deficit. (The dollar's subsequent fall from early 1985 through 1987 then pushed the American price level far below those in Europe and Japan. But despite the structural U.S. fiscal deficit being as large as ever, Mr. Feldstein has now switched positions and advocates further devaluation.)    But are such abrupt changes in relative prices -- particularly the terms of trade to effect capital transfer -- warranted if economies could potentially be integrated under fixed exchange rates? The late-19th-century experience suggests not.    If international payments adjustment worked so well when exchange rates were fixed, why was the gold standard so disliked by American populists in the late 19th century -- and why does the ideal of fixed rates remain unpopular with American economists today?    The common world price level was not satisfactorily anchored. Even on a year-to-year basis, variance in the American price level in the late 19th century was high by modern standards. No authority with a world-wide view -- not even the Bank of England -- was monitoring or controlling aggregate credit money with an eye to stabilizing the world price level.    When general deflationary pressure prevailed from 1873 to 1896, the U.S. suffered more severe cyclical downturns in real output than Britain or other European countries. The fragmented American system of unit banking, and the absence in the 19th century of an American central bank to act as a lender of last resort, meant that deflation was associated with gold convertibility crises and bank failures -- shocks that led to declines in income and employment. In contrast, Britain, at the center of the world's capital market, with a more rational system of commercial clearing banks and with the Bank of England acting as a backstop, coped better with a falling world price level.    But the world-wide inflations and deflations of the 19th century and the traumatic changes in relative international competitiveness characteristic of floating rates in the 1970s and 1980s commend us to a better alternative. After a steep drop-off in the relative importance of international trade between World War I and World War II, North America, Western Europe and Japan are now as mutually dependent on commerce and finance as were the former two a century ago.    If exchange rates were again credibly fixed through mutual monetary adjustment, the &quot;natural&quot; nominal anchor for the system as a whole would be the common price level over internationally tradable goods -- which can be approximated by wholesale or producer price indexes. The triumvirate could then, through joint and responsible central-bank policies, keep the new international monetary standard more stable than its 19th-century counterpart.    ---   Mr. McKinnon is Eberle professor of international economics at Stanford University.
