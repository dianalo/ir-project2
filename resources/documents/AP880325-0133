Teachers, parents, school boards, local businesses and othersinvolved in these 50 districts would have the union's blessings to``turn their school systems upside down or inside out'' in pursuitof improvements, said NEA President Mary Hatwood Futrell.   ``What we're proposing will say, `Let's look at everything,'''she told a news conference.   Asked if that would extend to merit pay plans, which her 1.85million-member union has bitterly opposed, Futrell said, ``I can'timagine that they would do that, but if they decide that's anexperiment that they would like to try and they bring us areasonable proposal, we would certainly consider that.''   Futrell said she will ask her state affiliates to work withgovernors, legislators and state education officials to reach aconsensus on designating ``at least one entire school district inevery state as an experimental, living laboratory to fundamentallyrestructure America's schools.''   Bold action is needed to revive a school reform movement thathas started to flag from insufficient funding, she said.   Her proposal drew qualified praise from a persistent critic ofthe NEA, William J. Bennett, the U.S. secretary of education.   Bennett issued a statement from Houston saying: ``It's ratherironic to hear a call for reform from the organization that hasdone the most to resist meaningful education reforms in recentyears. But if they are serious, it will be a welcome and refreshingchange to have NEA begin supporting real education reform.''   Futrell's counterpart at the American Federation of Teachers,Albert Shanker, has already scheduled a speech at the NationalPress Club on Thursday to unveil what his union calls ``a new andpractical plan for teachers to begin radically restructuringAmerica's public schools.''   The AFT said Shanker will outline ``a proposal that teachers beable to `opt out' of traditional responsibilities to create, runand administer innovative `mini-schools' within schools.''   Bella Rosenberg, an assistant to Shanker, said Futrell's ideasounded like ``more of the same old thing'' and ``an example of thetop-down kind of reform we and others are trying desperately to getaway from.''   AFT affiliates in Rochester, N.Y.; Dade County, Fla.; Hammond,Ind., and Toledo, Ohio, are already embarked on experiments givinglocal teachers more say in running schools. Toledo has a peerreview system to improve poor teachers or get them out of theclassroom.   Futrell also announced the NEA will decide April 28 whichDemocratic presidential candidate to endorse, if any. Like mostother unions, it has stayed on the political fence until thecrowded field of candidates sorted itself out.   Futrell said her experimental school district idea must still beapproved at the NEA's annual convention in New Orleans this July.But she already got a green light from the NEA's powerful board ofdirectors and has created a union committee on restructuring.   ``In these 50 school districts, school employees, workingthrough their local association, would join with school boards,parents, civic leaders and business to develop whatever innovativeor creative program they deem appropriate to improve education,''she said.   ``Those 50 local communities would be free to turn their schoolsystems upside down or inside out. They would be free to open theirschool doors to 4-year-olds, or end the arbitrary division of classperiods into 50-minute chunks, or experiment with alternatives tostudent tracking,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
