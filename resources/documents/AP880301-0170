The defense and administration officials commented underquestioning prompted by Republican presidential candidate PatRobertson's continued insistence, in the face of denials, that Cubamay have Soviet-made nuclear missiles aimed at the United States.   The officials said Cuba has about five dozen Frog-4 and Frog-7battlefield missiles, date to the 1960s.   The Frog-7, when originally introduced by the Soviets, couldcarry either a conventional or nuclear warhead, ``but we'reconfident no nuclear warheads ever went to Cuba for that missileand it doesn't have any range anyway,'' said one source whorequested anonymity.   According to the reference book ``Jane's Weapon Systems,'' theFrog-7 has a range of only about 43 miles _ or half the distancebetween Cuba and Florida. Moreover, the rocket has no guidancesystem to direct it to a specific target.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater dismissed Robertson'smissile claim when the candidate first advanced it last month. Hesaid Cuba had been under extensive surveillance since the 1962missile crisis and there was ``no evidence'' any other nuclearweaponry had ever been deployed there by the Soviet Union.   The officials contacted Tuesday endorsed that assessment, butmost insisted they not be identified on grounds they wished toavoid entanglement in the presidential race.   The sources said Cuban President Fidel Castro long ago assembledthe strongest military in the Caribbean, but they said his forcesposed little offensive threat to the United States.   On the other hand, they said, Cuba does serve as a major outpostfor Soviet forces, particularly surveillance units, and it supportscommunist movements around the world from Nicaragua to Angola andEthiopia.   ``Cuba is a horrible force for instability, but it is not amilitary threat to us directly,'' said one Pentagon official.   ``And it is certainly not a nuclear threat. They do not have anymissiles that could reach the United States _ nuclear orconventional _ and they do not have any nuclear bombs to hang onthe jets that could reach us.''   ``Cuba's military power has not appreciably increased in recentyears,'' said one administration official. ``Rather, their forceshave been modernized to keep pace.''   ``In overall terms, they really are not any more of a directmilitary threat to us than they were 10 years ago,'' said anothersource. ``It's serving as the host to the Russians that bothersus.''   Navy Cmdr. Robert Prucha, a Pentagon spokesman, said the DefenseDepartment endorsed the most recent assessment of Cuban militarypower published by the International Institute for StrategicStudies in London. According to that assessment, the Cubans have anactive-duty military force of approximately 175,000, of which145,000 are in the army, 12,000 in the navy and 18,500 in the airforce.   Within the army, the Pentagon believes the Cubans have about 65of the Frog missiles, Prucha said. Also in the Cuban inventory:</TEXT><TEXT>   _A wide variety of Soviet-made surface-to-air missiles thatcould be used against attacking aircraft, as well as short-rangeartillery rockets like the BM-21 and BM-24.   _About 950 tanks, including 300 of the more capable T-62 tanks,and at least 50 BMP infantry combat vehicles.   _Two Koni-class navy frigates made by the Soviet Union, alongwith three diesel submarines, 77 fast-attack patrol boats and 15mine sweepers.   _More than 250 Soviet-supplied combat aircraft, including atleast 50 modern MiG-23 Flogger ground-attack jets and more than 100MiG-21 jet interceptors.   Three years ago, Adm. Wesley McDonald, then the head of the U.S.Atlantic Command, described Cuba's forces as well equipped ``todefend Cuba against anything short of a massive invasion.''   He said the Cuban air force _ with aircraft like the MiG-25s _had ``the range to reach portions of the southeastern U.S.A. andmost of the Caribbean Sea area.''   ``But that doesn't mean they have anything nuclear to hang onthose planes,'' said one Pentagon source. ``We maintain constantsurveillance on Cuba, including SR-71 (spy plane) reconnaissance.   ``Everything that goes in to Cuba is monitored, and nuclearweapons haven't gone in.''</TEXT></DOC>
