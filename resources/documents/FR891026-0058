Background</ITAG>On October 17, 1986, the President signed the Superfund Amendments andReauthorization Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-499), which extends and amendsthe Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Actof 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.).Section 104(i) of CERCLA, as amended, requires the preparation of: (1)A list of hazardous substances found at NPL sites (in order of priority),(2) toxicological profiles of those substances, and (3) the initiationof a research program to fill data gaps associated with the substances.A priority list of the first 100 substances was published (52 FR 12866,April 17, 1987), with a short summary of the procedure used by ATSDR andEPA to compile the list. In that notice, the agencies solicited publiccomment on the approach adopted for evaluating and ranking hazardous substancesfound at NPL sites, and announced the intention to refine the listing processin response to these comments and ongoing efforts by the agencies to improvethe listing process.A second priority list of 100 additional substances was published (53 FR41280, October 20, 1988). At that time, the procedure used to prepare thesecond priority list was summarized. For the most part, the same procedurewas used to prepare the third list of 25 substances that appears in thisnotice.The approach used to prepare this third list is summarized below. The agenciessolicit public comment on this approach; such comments should be submittedin accordance with the instructions given in this notice. The agencieswill continue to seek improvements in the listing process as future revisionsof the list are prepared. All non-confidential comments previously receivedare in the public file for this notice. A more detailed description ofthe revised listing methodology is contained in support documents whichhave been placed in the public file and are available for public review(see unit V of this notice).<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Review of Methodology for Selecting Substances on the First List</ITAG>A. General Approach for the First ListTo obtain the first list of 100 hazardous substances, ATSDR and EPA defineda subset of the 717 hazardous substances which formed the CERCLA list (undersection 102 of CERCLA). The subset was defined as those hazardous substanceswhich EPA has identified at National Priorities List (NPL) sites. To rankthe substances within this subset, three criteria were considered: (1)Toxicity, (2) frequency of occurrence at NPL sites or facilities, and (3)potential for human exposure. These criteria reflect the requirements ofsection 104(i)(2) of CERCLA. To develop a detailed ranking system employingthese criteria, ATSDR and EPA first reviewed a number of hazard scoringsystems for their applicability to the ranking criterion of toxicity. Fromall the approaches considered, the Reportable Quantity (RQ) scoring schemewas selected for ranking toxicity of the 100 priority substances. The RQscoring scheme is described in several <T4>Federal Register</T4> documents (50 FR 13456, April 4, 1985; 51 FR34534, September 29, 1986; and 52 FR 8140, March 16, 1987).The second criterion used by ATSDR and EPA to prepare the first prioritylist of hazardous substances was the frequency of occurrence at NPL sites.Data from the Contract Laboratory Program (CLP) statistical data base wasused for determining frequency of occurrence. The CLP is an EPA programwhich provides a range of chemical analysis services at hazardous wastesites. The CLP statistical data base represents a random, stratified sampleof sites and waste samples from those sites that were analyzed under CLPRoutine Analytical Services (Randamp;S) contracts from 1980 to 1984. Thedata base provided information on the percentage of sites at which substancewas detected at least once in any medium (i.e., frequency of occurrence)and the average and range of concentrations for each medium or matrix (e.g.,soil, ground water, drums).The third criterion used to prepare the first priority list of hazardoussubstances was the potential for human exposure. ATSDR and EPA evaluatedvarious sources of data associated with this criterion, and selected theCLP survey data to derive a rough estimate of potential for human exposureto hazardous substances at NPL sites. Three types of exposure-related datafrom the CLP curve were used: the average concentration of the candidatesubstances detected in ground water and surface water across the 358 NPLsites included in the CLP survey; the frequency of detection of those substancesin ground water and surface water across the 358 sites; and whether thesubstances had been selected for detailed exposure and risk assessmentat Superfund Remedial sites.B. Generation of the First ListUsing the ranking factors described above, as well as some minor criteria,ATSDR and EPA developed an alogrithm incorporating these criteria to calculatea hazard index value for each candidate substances. This alogrithm servedas the basis for generating the rank of the first 100 substances. The startingpoint for the hazard index calculation was the subset of hazardous substanceswhich EPA had identified at NPL sites based on the site percent data fromthe CLP survey. The agencies divided the site percent data value for eachsubstance (representing frequency of occurrence) by the lowest RQ valuefor the substance (based on acute toxiciy, chronic toxicity, or potentialcarcinogenicity) to generate a site index for each substance. ATSDR andEPA ranked the candidate substances based on their site indices. The agenciesthen calculated an exposure index for each substance by ranking them basedon the three exposure-related factors (with each factor receiving equalweight). The final step in the algorithm was to combine the site indexrank and the exposure index value to obtain a hazard index for each substance.The substances were prioritized based on their hazard indices.For purposes of assessing hazardous substances in toxicity profiles, ATSDRand EPA combined some of the candidate substances into groups. If substancesare stereoisomers of one another, are readily metabolized to other substanceson the list, or generally are characterized as mixtures with respect totoxicity and/or frequency of occurrence, they were grouped together andoccupy only one position on the priority list. Examples of these typesof substances include: heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide; endrin and endrinaldehyde; PCBs.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Methodology for Selecting on the Second and Third Lists</ITAG>A. Bases for Improvements in Methodology for Selecting SubstancesAfter publication of the first priority list of hazardous substances, ATSDRand EPA solicited public comment and conducted critical reviews of theabove-described prioritizing method in order to identify potential improvements.The procedure used to generate the second 100 substances was a modifiedversion of that used to rank the first 100. The modifications reflect aneffort to: (1) Improve data acquisition for data-poor substances of thesecond list, and (2) adapt the method to data sources that provide a morecomplete description of exposure to substances found at NPL sites. Theranking alogrithm used to generate the third list is the same version asthat used for the second list. However. several new sources of exposureand frequency of occurrence data were used as inputs for the alogrithm.B. Determination of the Frequency of Occurrence Criterion of the RankingMethodologyIn the procedure for selection of the first 100 priority substances, thenumber of NPL sites at which a substance is found was estimated from theCLP statistical data base. For selection of the second 100 priority substances,two additional estimates of frequency of occurrence were employed, theNPL technical (NPLt) data base, and the CLP Special Analytical Services(SAS) data base. For the development of the third list, the View data base(described below) was substituted for NPLt, and the CLP Analytical Resultsdata base (CARD) was added to supplement the CLP statistical data base(described above). The View, CARD, and SAS data bases are described below.The View data base has been developed by ATSDR's Exposure and Disease RegistryBranch (EPRB) for use in selecting sites for Exposure Registry development.View is built upon EPA's NPLt data base supplemented with information fromATSDR Health Assessment and Health Consultation documents. View currentlycontains updated verified frequency of occurrence data for all of the 1,177NPL sites. The View data based was used as a replacement for the NPLt database as a source of frequency of occurrence data for the algorithm.CARD contains information generated by recent CLP Routine Analytical Services(RAS) contracts. The CARD system currently contains about 1.5 years ofmonitoring data. Only CARD data from NPL sites was used as a source offrequency of occurrence data for the algorithm.The final source of additional information used to estimate frequency ofoccurrence was the SAS data base. This data base contains information onthe occurrence of substances which do not appear in the CLP statisticaldatabase for methodological reasons. Most of the information in the COPstatistical data base is obtained under the RAS program, in which samplessubmitted for analysis are screened for certain target chemicals; additionalsubstances are then determined by matching their mass spectra to knownstandards. A request for determination of a substance under SAS may occurwhen there is a reason to believe that a specific hazardous compound ispresent in a sample at a concentration below the detection limit of theRAS, or when there is reason to believe that a specific hazardous substancewhich is not a target substance may be present in a sample.The SAS data files were examined to identify substances with five or morerequests for SAS which are not present in the CLP statistical database.Those substances were then examined further to determine the number ofNPL sites at which the substance had actually been detected. This numberwas then divided by the total number of NPL sites to obtain a site percentfrequency.The overall site percent value used for a particular substance was thehighest of the CLP statistical data base site percent (as determined byeither RAS or SAS data), the View data base site percent, and the CARDsite percent.C. Determination of the Exposure Component of the Ranking MethodologyFor the preparation of the second list, ATSDR and EPA expanded the basesfor evaluating the potential for human exposure to the priority substancesin two ways: (1) By considering the air and soil as additional routes ofpotential exposure, and (2) by considering additional databases reflectingthe potential for human exposure to the substances.The potential for exposure to candidate substances through soil was consideredby incorporating data on soil concentrations from the CLP statistical database in the calculation of an exposure index for each substance. To estimatethe potential for air exposure, ATSDR and EPA used an indirect method,since no data are readily available on actual air concentrations of thecandidate substances at NPL sites. Retention time on a gas chromatographycolumn was used to estimate the potential for air migration since thesevalues correlate positively with boiling point, which in turn correlatesnegatively with volatility. For the development of the third list, theagencies used boiling points as a correlate of potential for air migrationbecause they were more readily available for the substances to be ranked.The potential for air exposure was included in the calculation of an overallexposure index.Exposure potential also was represented in the second 100 ranking procedurethrough the incorporation of eight separate data sources. The data sourcesused were:<ITAG tagnum="15">CLP statistical data base (CLPs)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NPL Technical data base (NPLt)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Human Adipose Tissue Survey (NHATS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Information System(DOT/HMIS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Acute Hazardous Events data base (AHE)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">National Response Center data base (NRC)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Removal Tracking system data base (RTS)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">NEXIS</ITAG>This source list was modified for the development of the third list toexclude NPLt and include the following additional sources:<ITAG tagnum="15">CLP Analytical Results data base (CARD)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">View data base</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Toxic Release Inventory (TRI)</ITAG>Information from these sources was incorporated in one of two ways: (1)As part of the water, soil and air exposure potential rank (boiling point,and CARD and CLP concentration data) or (2) as a weighting factor appliedto the overall exposure rank (NHATS, DOT/HMIS, AHE, NRC, NEXIS, RTS, TRI).When no NPL site soil or water concentration data were available to determinethe exposure potential rank, information on frequency of occurrence atsites was used as an alternative. The ten data bases used to estimate exposurepotential for the development of the third list are described below.<ITAG tagnum="81">CLP Statistical Data Base</ITAG>The CLPs contain data on the frequency of occurrence and media concentrationof chemicals found at NPL and other hazardous waste sites. The data basewas derived from CLP Routine Analytical Service (RAS) analyses and containsconcentrations of specific chemicals found in soil, ground water, and surfacewater from a subset of the total NPL sites. Only the information from NPLsites was used to estimate exposure potential for development of the thirdlist.<ITAG tagnum="81">National Human Adipose Tissue Survey</ITAG>The NHATS data base contains chemical analysis data of human adipose tissuecollected from individuals in hospitals across the United States. Informationis available for 372 substances, derived from 800 individual adipose tissuesamples that were pooled into 46 composite samples (approximately 17 individualsamples per composite). This data base gives some indication of the degreeto which the population of the United States has been exposed to the substancesdetected. The ATSDR and EPA considered occurrence of a substance in humantissue to be an indication of potential for significant human exposure,and therefore assigned greater weight to the exposure index for such substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">Department of Transportation Hazardous Materials Information System(DOT/HMIS)</ITAG>The DOT/HMIS data base contains information concerning accidental releaseof hazardous substances during transportation. A written report must besubmitted to HMIS within 15 days of the accidental release. The reportscontain an identification of the substance released and an accounting ofany injuries or fatalities resulting from the release. The ATSDR and EPAconsidered occurrence of a substance in the HMIS data base to be an indicationof potential for significant human exposure at facilities on the NPL, andtherefore ATSDR and EPA assigned greater weight to the exposure index forsuch candidate substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">Acute Hazardous Events Data Base</ITAG>The AHE data base was developed by the EPA, following the tragic releaseof a toxic substance in Bhopal, India, to provide information concerningsudden, accidental releases of toxic chemicals in the United States. Themain purpose of the data base is to characterize the kinds of events releasingacutely toxic substances, the substances involved, and the causative factorsleading to their release. The ATSDR and EPA considered occurrence of asubstance in the AHE data base to be an indication of potential for significanthuman exposure at facilities on the NPL; therefore, ATSDR and EPA assignedgreater weight to the exposure index for such candidate substances.<ITAG tagnum="81">National Response Center Data Base</ITAG>The NRC data base contains information concerning hazardous substance releasesexceeding the RQ, pipeline failures and certain transportation incidentsinvolving hazardous substances, and certain releases of toxic or flammablegases. ATSDR and EPA considered the occurrence of a candidate substancein data base for any releases that resulted in death, injury, or evacuation,to be an indication of potential for significant human exposure at facilitieson the NPL. Consequently the agencies increased the weight of the exposureindex for any candidate substances listed in the NRC.<ITAG tagnum="81">Removal Tracking System Data Base</ITAG>The RTS data base describes activities undertaken to clean up a site underthe Superfund removal program. It lists the materials of concern that triggereda removal action and frequently lists other major contaminants being addressedat a site. ATSDR and EPA considered that the occurrence of a candidatesubstance in this data base indicates potential for significant human exposure.Consequently the agencies increased the weight of the exposure index forany candidate substances listed in the RTS.<ITAG tagnum="81">NEXIS</ITAG>The NEXIS information system contains full-text articles reporting therelease of toxic substances in over 125 newspapers, newsletters, and wireservices. ATSDR and EPA considered the reporting in this data base of releaseof a candidate substance which led to human death, injury, or evacuation,to be a significant indicator of potential for significant human exposureat facilities on the NPL. Consequently, the agencies increased the weightof the exposure index for any such substance.<ITAG tagnum="81"> CLP Analytical Results Data Base</ITAG>The CARD contains soil and water monitoring information generated by allCLP RAS contracts starting on or after January 1, 1988. Substance geometricmean soil and water concentration data from NPL sites in CARD was usedthoroughly estimate exposure potential for development of the third list.<ITAG tagnum="81">View Data Base</ITAG>The View data base is built upon EPA's NPLt data base supplemented withinformation from ATSDR Health Assessment and Health Consultation documents.View currently contains updated verified frequency of occurrence data forall of the 1,177 NPL sites.<ITAG tagnum="81">Toxic Release Inventory</ITAG>Section 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-To-Know Act (alsoknown as SARA Title III), requires EPA to establish a computerized nationaldata base of toxic chemical emissions from manufacturing facilities throughoutthe United States. This TRI is a composite of over 70,000 submissions oftoxic release inventory reports filed on Section 313 chemicals. Industryis required to submit these forms annually to EPA and the states. The datacurrently available represent releases in 1987. Information in the database includes quantitative estimates of releases to air, water, and soil,facility information including storage data, and waste treatment data.Reported releases in the TRI data base were used to weight the exposureindex for candidate substances.D. Determination of the Toxicity Component of the Ranking MethodologyATSDR and EPA decided to continue to use the Reportable Quantity (RQ) approachas a hazard scoring system, for the same reasons that guided its choicefor the first and second prioirity list of hazardous substances. This approachprovides the most complete characterization of toxicity of all hazard scoringsystems reviewed by the agencies.The reportable quantity ranking scheme was developed by EPA to set RQsfor hazardous substances as required by CERCLA. Each RQ category correspondsto a weight, in pounds, for which releases must be reported to the CoastGuard's NRC. Section 103 of CERCLA requires immediate notification fromany person in charge of a vessel or an offshore or onshore facility thatreleases an amount of a hazardous substance equal to or greater than itsRQ. RQs are developed for individual chemicals and waste streams that havealready been designated under CERCLA as hazardous substances. Each CERCLA hazardous substance is assigned to one of five RQ categoriesbased on chronic toxicity, acute toxicity, carcinogenicity, aquatic toxicity,and ignitability and reactivity. RQs are determined for each criterionseparately, and the lowest of these is selected as the RQ for the substance.Only values for acute and chronic mammalian toxicity or carcinogenicitywere considered for developing the third list of 25 hazardous substances.Some of the candidate hazardous substances have not yet been assigned RQvalues. In these cases, the ATSDR and EPA used the expertise of EPA's Officeof Toxic Substances (OTS) to evaluate the potential health hazards associatedwith new chemicals submitted to the Premanufacture Notice Program. OTSemploys a panel of toxicologists to assign a level of concern for the potentialfor toxicity, based upon the available experimental data, physical-chemicalproperties, toxicities of analogous substances, and toxicities of possiblemetabolites of the substance, or of substances analogous to possible metabolites.Based on this expert opinion, the level of concern for potential toxicitywas adjusted to a five-point scale to coincide with the five-point RQ scale.This value was then used to represent the RQ value in the ranking algorithm.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Generation of the List</ITAG>ATSDR and EPA generated an algorithm to rank the hazard potential of eachcandidate substance. The starting point for the hazard index calculationwas the subset of hazardous substances which EPA had identified at NPLsites by means of the View data base, CARD, the CLP Statistical data baseor the SAS data base. The agencies divided the site percent value for eachsubstance (representing frequency-of-occurrence) by the lowest RQ valuefor the substance (based on acute toxicity, chronic toxicity, or potentialcarcinogenicity) to generate a site index for each substance. ATSDR andEPA ranked the candidate substances based on their site indices, then calculatedan exposure potential index for each substance. This index was based uponwater concentration, soil concentration, and the boiling point of eachsubstance, or frequency of occurrence (if no other information was available).The final step in the algorithm was to combine the site index rank andthe exposure index value to obtain a hazard index for each candidate substance.The third list of substances is composed of the 25 previously unlistedsubstances which have the highest hazard potential based on their hazardindices.The algorithm for calculating the hazard index is described in greaterdetail in the support document for this notice, which is contained in thepublic file.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
