However, frontalsolvers suggested so far involve rather complex bookkeeping and datamanipulation, and thus are lacking the uniformity desired for vectorand parallel processing. On the other hand, band solution techniquesare very simple and uniform, but not interleave assembly and factorization.In this paper the authors suggest a window-oriented organization of thefrontal method which is attractive to both sequential and parallel processing.The authors' goal is to obtain an implementation of a frontal solverwhich is as simple as the implementations of band solvers.</TEXT></DOC>
