Ceramic raw material powder is pressure-molded and isbaked in a high temperature baking oven. Raw material powder have diameterof 0.1 - 1 micron level wherein more than 100 million atoms are contained.An extreme case of uniformized ceramics is a thin film formed by decomposing/evaporatingthe material into atoms to coagulate onto a substrate. There are twomethods for the formation of thin films, physical method (heat evaporation,spattering evaporation) and chemical method (thermal decomposition andevaporation). Hetero-epitaxial growth method is used for making a thinfilm of single crystal of a superconductive phase. In a gas-phase method,a single crystal substrate is maintained at 600 - 800{sup 0}C whereinatoms of the raw material of stoichiometric ratio are evaporated. Thisreport furthermore describes on the practice of thin film making andits basic characteristics, and problems in its electronic applications.(6 figs, 2 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
