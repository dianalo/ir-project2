To the South Africans, who invented it, the 11-ton vehicle, withits heavy firepower and sturdy protection against landmines, it isthe ultimate weapon for counter-insurgency warfare.   To the local people, the Casspir is the embodiment of evil. Theylargely support SWAPO and they look upon the South Africans an anarmy of occupation.   Now, with the 23-year bush war supposedly at an end and Namibiapreparing for independence from South Africa under United Nationssupervision, a change of image may be in store for what one bumpersticker seen here calls ``Casspir _ an unfriendly ghost.''   U.N. police monitors assigned to watch the local security forcesand report abuses of authority during the election campaign arepreparing to acquire at least 10 Casspirs for their own use.   In U.N. livery _ white paint with big black ``U.N.'' letters onthe side _ the armored cars will no longer instill the fear thatmany people say they felt whenever the army or police roared past,turrets bristling with machine guns.   Although various versions of the Casspir have been employed byregular and paramilitary forces in Ovamboland, it's fearsomereputation stems mainly from the Koevoet, the counter-insurgencypolice made up of local black officers led by white South Africans.   Koevoet _ the names mean ``crowbar'' in Afrikaans _ is notoriousfor tough and often brutal tactics in prying out the SWAPOguerrillas infiltrating across the border from Angola.   Local people tell of terrorist raids, beatings and cropdestructions in Koevoet's campaign to crush SWAPO, and a few Koevoetmembers have been charged with murder.   Some of Koevoet's Casspirs, actually a more powerful versioncalled the Wolf Turbo, have been earmarked for the U.N. policemonitors operating out of Oshakati, the nerve center for U.N.operations in the region.   Peter Fitzgerald, a silver-haired Irishman on leave from his postas a Dublin police superintendent to serve as district commander ofthe U.N. contingent, calls the Casspirs ``absolutely the mostintimidating articles I have ever seen in my life.''   He said it was necessary, however, for the U.N. TransitionAssistance Group to have its own Casspirs in order to keep track ofthe local police, who continue to use them on bush patrols of up toseven days at a time. Unlike the police, the UNTAG vehicles willhave no weapons on board.   Under U.N. Resolution 435, which spells out procedures forNamibia's independence by early next year, Koevoet has already beenintegrated into the South-West African Police. However, the unitremains active and reports persist of Koevoet members continuing tobadger residents who express pro-SWAPO sympathies.   U.N. officials at the operational level say proof of police abuseis hard to obtain, and UNTAG recently moved to double to 1,000 thenumber of monitors assigned as police watchdogs.   The sight of numerous police Casspirs in recent days with their50-caliber machine guns still mounted also indicates that the policeforces have not fully complied with a U.N. proviso for disarming thevehicles.   Fred Eckhard, a U.N. spokesman, said it was understood that thepolice would carry only small arms. While not clearly defined, hesaid, this was generally taken to mean nothing more than sidearmsand semi-automatic rifles. Mounted machine guns would violate thatunderstanding, he said.   Many South Africans see the Casspir as the proudest achievementof a home-grown arms industry springing out of a 1972 arms importembargo, imposed by the United Nations in response to the SouthAfrican government's refusal to abandon apartheid.   Military sources say that despite the embargo, South Africa nowmanufactures 95 percent of its own weapons and has become theworld's 10th largest arms exporter, with customers in 32 countries.   Casspirs have reportedly been put on display at internationalarms shows.   The name Casspir is an acronym derived from the vehicles'designers, the Council for Scientific Research, and the SouthAfrican Police, for whom it was originally developed. Differentversions are tailored for a specific task, carrying infantry intobattle or urban riot control.   Its most innovative feature is a heavily armored, V-shapedunderbody designed to deflect, rather than absorb, the blast of aland mine.   While SWAPO has periodically claimed to have damaged or destroyedthe vehicles in the bush war, South African military sources sayCasspirs that hit SWAPO-laid mines suffered only minor crew injuriesand damage that was easily repaired.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Mon PMs July 3</NOTE></DOC>
