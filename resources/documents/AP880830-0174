Witnesses said at least fourprotesters suffered minor injuries when police dispersed the crowdbut no arrests were reported.   Both the university and Industrial Arts School were closedTuesday and the demonstrators called for the resignation ofNoriega, who as commander of the Defense Forces controls Panama'scivilian government.   On Tuesday, more than 50 riot police tried to clear thebarricaded streets in the capital's downtown university zone.
