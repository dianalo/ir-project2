Field tests were conductedon the effectiveness of the fingerprint technique for application. Thetechnique analyzed the geological environment with organic gases of relativelyhigh molecular weight as a clue. Since these gases has low volatilityand low transferability, it was found that the fault/fracture can belocated with an error in a very narrow range of 10(-20) m. It is alsocapable of effectively detecting the extent of Catagenesis zone nearthe geothermal reservoir, which is the source of underground gases. Byconcentrating the survey of fracture to the possible geothermal area,the fracture that governs the structure of geothermal reservoir can beeffectively detected. (18 figs, 8 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
