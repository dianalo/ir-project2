It has been recognized for quite some time thatin large and complex man-machine interactive systems human errors cancontribute substantially to failures of these systems, and that the improvementin the human interface in man-machine systems is essential for the safetyof the plant. Many important surveys have been made in some member countries.These studies and operational experience have shown that it is possibleto substantially reduce this adverse impact of human errors in nuclearpower plant operations by the application of human factors technology.This technology. This technology includes: (1) selection of people withthe requisite skills and knowledge and providing them with job-relevanttraining, (2) maintenance of the necessary job qualifications for eachperson in the plant, (3) design of man-machine interfaces which are fullycompatible with the capabilities and limitations of the people in thesystem, and (4) design of job operations, including written materials,to facilitate required quality of human performance. A review is madeof education/training, operator support systems, human error data collection,analysis of safety significant events and future activities. (Nogami,K.).</TEXT></DOC>
