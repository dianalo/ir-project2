After all, consider the problem. Although Japan continuesto rack up big trade surpluses with the U.S., the yen keepssagging against the dollar. That only makes Japanese goodscheaper for voracious American consumers -- and U.S. productscostlier for the less-than-voracious Japanese consumers. Andthat makes the deficit even more intractable.</LP><TEXT>   One obvious solution? Increase the value of the yen. TheU.S. and other nations have tried to do just that -- bybuying yen in foreign-exchange markets. The recent actions,however, have been less than successful. More important,though, they have ignited the debate about the value of suchgovernment intervention. They have also pitted theinterventionist Treasury against the hands-off FederalReserve Board.   Little wonder, then, that several economists expectintervention to be discussed at the Houston summit. &quot;Thesecond most important thing that the summiteers could do{after the talks on trade} is stop the terrible amount offoreign-exchange intervention,&quot; says Allan Meltzer, aneconomist at Carnegie Mellon University, who leaves littledoubt where he stands on the debate.   Opponents such as Mr. Meltzer contend that intervention isa form of protectionism. Intervention can't have any lastingeffects, they argue, because the foreign-exchange markets areso huge and because it is an artificial attempt bygovernments to override the markets' decisions. Opponentsalso note that the U.S. has frequently lost money as a resultof such moves.   The advocates of intervention maintain that by actingtogether, the world's most powerful central banks can tell --and convince -- foreign-exchange markets that a currency istrading at the wrong price. Central-bank actions, theybelieve, can influence or at least smooth the markets.   They point to the success of the accord struck at NewYork's Plaza Hotel by the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Franceand Britain in September 1985 to push down the value of theU.S. dollar. But, as even many intervention advocatesconcede, the governments through their intervention werereinforcing what the markets had already begun to believe:that the dollar was substantially overvalued.   &quot;Our view is that intervention can be effective if it'sdone decisively and jointly,&quot; says John Williamson, a seniorfellow at the Institute for International Economics, aliberal Washington think tank.   Even such advocates, however, have their complaints. Inthis year's attempt to prop up the yen, major central banks&quot;weren't doing it jointly,&quot; Mr. Williamson says. &quot;For awhile,&quot; he maintains, &quot;the Americans appeared to have lostinterest.&quot; The Treasury and the Federal Reserve Boardcouldn't agree on what the appropriate action should be, andthis sent confusing signals to the market, Mr. Williamsonargues.   Since the Western world's largest economies moved tofloating exchange rates in 1973, there have been manyinstances of concerted intervention -- with varying degreesof success. Of course, those who favor a return to fixedexchange rates point out that one of the advantages of such asystem is that it removes the need to intervene to influencethe value of currencies.   One of the more controversial pieces of coordinatedintervention occurred after the Louvre Accord of February1987. As a result of that accord, the Group of Seven,comprising the world's major economies, agreed to try to stemthe decline of the dollar, and even set specific secretcurrency ranges. That accord is generally regarded as havingbeen less successful than the Plaza agreement.   It was the Treasury's desire earlier this year to push thedollar down -- particularly against the yen -- that led toconfrontation with the Fed in March and April. In April thedollar was worth close to 160 yen, up sharply from 144 yen inJune of last year.   The Fed saw intervention, which involved the selling ofdollars by many countries, as dangerous &quot;dollar-bashing&quot; thatmight damage the central bank's campaign to hold downinflation. (A cheaper dollar means that imported goods costAmericans more.) The Fed wanted yen-boosting interventiononly if the participating countries each sold their owncurrencies -- not the dollar -- against the yen. But othernations, especially Germany, declined, fearing inflationarypressures in their own economies.   &quot;I've never objected to intervention to support the yen,but that {intervention} has been translated into generaldollar sales,&quot; Fed Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said in aninterview earlier this year.   At the March 27 meeting of the Fed's Open MarketCommittee, the record says that &quot;many expressed strongskepticism that intervention operations can by themselveshave a lasting effect on the value of the dollar inforeign-currency markets, given that the effects of theseoperations are routinely sterilized.&quot;   Such operations are sterilized when the Fed withdraws fromcirculation a similar number of dollars to those put intocirculation by intervening. Thus, if the Fed spent $10million on intervening, it might sell $10 million ofshort-term Treasury securities, siphoning those dollars outof the marketplace. The purpose is to damp down inflation.Advocates of intervention would argue that the two operationsare separate: that the intervention depresses the dollar inthe foreign-exchange markets while the later sale ofsecurities absorbs excess dollars from the general economy.Opponents, such as those on the Fed, would argue that the twooperations largely cancel each other out.   Among those most opposed to intervention is the presidentof the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, W. Lee Hoskins. Inan article in the Cleveland Fed's Economic Commentarynewsletter, Mr. Hoskins and Owen Humpage, an economic adviserto the Cleveland Fed, disparage government attempts toinfluence exchange rates as &quot;monetary protectionism.&quot;&quot;Interventionist policies may be politically appealing,&quot; theysay, because a lower dollar helps American businessmen sellgoods abroad. The two argue, however, that such policies are&quot;economically myopic,&quot; because they merely put off the needfor businessmen to improve productivity and performance.   But central bankers in this country can quarrel all theywant about U.S. intervention policy. It's the Treasury -- notthe bankers -- that sets the policy, albeit &quot;in consultation&quot;with the Fed. Thus, at the March 27 meeting, the Open MarketCommittee, despite the Fed's general reluctance towardintervention, raised to $25 billion the total value offoreign currencies it can hold at any one time. That was anincrease of only $4 billion in the limit on the committee'sholdings of foreign currencies. But since May 1989 the limithas risen 108%, according to a record of the meeting.   The Fed's &quot;warehousing&quot; of foreign currencies for theTreasury also has jumped. At that same March meeting, the 12Fed governors voted 9-3 to raise warehousing limits to $15billion from $10 billion. It was only last September that thecommittee had doubled that limit to $10 billion.(&quot;Warehousing&quot; -- which increases the Treasury's ability tointervene -- refers to a complex series of transactions inwhich the Fed, in effect, holds foreign currencies for theTreasury for a certain period.)   Advocates of intervention say that despite the increase,the overall amount of foreign currency held by the U.S.remains relatively lower than that of other nations. &quot;Onereally shouldn't get over-agitated about the size offoreign-currency holdings,&quot; says Mr. Williamson. &quot;U.S.holdings are really quite modest compared to those of othercountries.&quot;   The Fed concedes that point but takes a differentapproach. It says in its Open Market Committee record thatholdings of foreign currencies are at &quot;historically highlevels&quot; for the U.S. and warns that this carries &quot;the risk ofsizable losses if the dollar strengthens.&quot;   The Fed, however, has a short memory. Not so many yearsago, in the early 1980s, it was arguing the other side of theintervention case. Under Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, itwas Fed Chairman Paul Volcker who was pleading with theTreasury to intervene more to hold down the surging value ofthe dollar. Mr. Regan, a hands-off free marketeer, didn'tfollow Mr. Volcker's advice.   Previous policy in the Reagan administration was &quot;nothinglike what's happened&quot; in this administration, complains Prof.Meltzer, the avid anti-interventionist. Current policymakers,he says, have &quot;just gone berserk.&quot;   ---   Mr. Truell is a staff reporter in The Wall StreetJournal's Washington bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
