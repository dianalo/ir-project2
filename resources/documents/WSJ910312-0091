Mr. Kotlowitzhas kept in touch with the boy, Lafeyette, and has written abook that follows Lafeyette, his younger brother Pharoah andtheir friends over a two-year period. The book looks at lifein today's inner-city through the eyes of its children. Thisarticle about Lafeyette's friendship with an older boy hasbeen excerpted from Mr. Kotlowitz's book, &quot;There Are NoChildren Here: The Story of Two Boys Growing Up in the OtherAmerica,&quot; which will be published this month by Nan A.Talese/Doubleday.                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   In hindsight, the summer of 1988 was a season ofdisappointment and, ultimately, of tragedy. At the time,though, Lafeyette's mother, LaJoe, thought it a season ofhope, an unusually calm, even radiant few months, certainly arespite from the family's recent troubles. It was a dramaticchange from what she now referred to as &quot;the war-zone summer&quot;of the previous year.   On this blistering, humid May afternoon -- the thermometerwould top 100 degrees seven times this summer -- theplaintive falsetto of pop singer Keith Sweat floated from arecord player placed outside Lafeyette and Pharoah'sbuilding.                                                                                                          Let me hear ya tell me you want me   Let me hear you say you'll never leave me baby   Until the morning light   Just make it last forever and ever.                                                                                                          Please, LaJoe thought to herself, make this moment lastforever. Over 50 adults and children had gathered by thefront entrance of 1920 West Washington, their bodies jigglingand pulsating to Sweat's hit tune. It was an unusual sight atthe Henry Horner Homes -- a large crowd of people minglingand laughing together, as if they hadn't a worry in theworld. Even Lafeyette, now 13, who stood to the side, hisback and shoulders rattling rhythmically, smiled at thescene. His mother noted that she had never seen him so atease.   The young man responsible for this musical gathering wasCraig Davis, a good-natured 18-year-old who didn't even liveat Horner, but at another public housing complex, the ABLAHomes. Craig's girlfriend lived with her mother on the secondfloor of Lafeyette's building and Craig visited her regularlyafter school. He spent a great deal of time in the building,and though it took a few weeks before the Vice Lords and theGangster Stones were assured that Craig didn't belong to arival gang, he quickly won the hearts of the youngerchildren.   His ambitions in life were to be a good father -- he hadtwo daughters by another girl -- and to be a disc jockey. Hetold Lafeyette he planned to get a job once he graduated fromhigh school so that he could buy a house in a quietneighborhood where he could raise his kids.   Craig was currently enrolled at Cregier High School.Though slowed down by a slight learning disability, which hisschool's psychological report identified as &quot;a problem withaudio-visual coordination and poor memory,&quot; Craig had managedto make it to his senior year, something three-fourths of hisfreshman class had failed to do. He particularly impressedhis teachers with his creative writing.   But Craig lived for his music. Whenever he had a sparemoment, he wrote raps, which he sent to local radio stationsin the hope that they would be read on the air. He sharedsome of them with Lafeyette and would often ask for hisopinion. He had told Lafeyette he was planning to apply to abroadcasting school, where he could learn to be a radiodeejay.   Craig was different from all the other teen-age boysLafeyette knew. Here was an older boy who not only paidattention to him, but took him seriously. What's more, Craighad thought about the future, something most young men inthis neighborhood rejected -- often for good reason -- as awaste of time. He had the grandest of dreams: a home in asafe and neat neighborhood and a family. He warned Lafeyetteto stay away from the gangs.   &quot;I liked how he thought,&quot; Lafeyette later said. &quot;He usedto talk about a lot of good things.&quot;   Lafeyette often admired Craig from a distance, watchinghim walk through the projects, headphones hugging his head,his hands knocking out a beat, his long legs stridingsmoothly and quickly, always as if he had a destination andpurpose in mind.   On this particular afternoon, as Craig would do numeroustimes through the summer, he set up two turntables and aspeaker in front of Lafeyette's seven-story building, on whattenants there generously referred to as &quot;the porch.&quot; Inreality, it was a slab of concrete about 10 feet deep and 20feet across that led into the building's dark breezeway. Thecorners where the slab met the building bore the unmistakablesmell of urine; it was a nook where drunks could relievethemselves without being seen.   Since an overhang covered the entrance, tenants from theupper floors couldn't watch the activities on the porch,where gang members dealt drugs. The overhang, like the porch,was made of concrete and had the acoustical effect ofdirecting the music outward, into the playground, so thatpeople in the three surrounding buildings could hear ofCraig's arrival. Like the Pied Piper's followers, theydrifted to the front of 1920 West Washington, lured by theblasting beat of pop stars, rap groups and soul singers.                                                                                                          As the evening wore on and the crowd swelled, Craigpersuaded even the shyest of friends to start dancing.&quot;Mama,&quot; 10-year-old Pharoah yelled over the rowdy raps of thegroup El Jabbar, &quot;watch . . . watch me. It's the wop.&quot;Pharoah's shoulders and arms began to move in militarysyncopation as his legs, which he jerkily bent at the knees,propelled his upper body up and down. Adding to the frenzy ofthe new dance, he thrust his small chest forward and back,like the proudest of peacocks. LaJoe, 36, poked her friend,Rochelle. &quot;Will you look at the old boy,&quot; she said, laughingwith a freedom she hadn't felt in a long time.   Next to LaJoe and Rochelle stood Lafeyette and his friendJames. James, who had moved out of Horner earlier in theyear, still came back to visit with his mother on occasionalweekends. James, too, adored Craig. &quot;Look at how he makes allthese people laugh,&quot; he said to Lafeyette. &quot;Man, people enjoyhim.&quot;   &quot;C'mon out here. Let's dance,&quot; Rochelle urged Lafeyette.&quot;C'mon, Chicken Legs.&quot; Rochelle had nicknamed him because hewas so skinny.   Lafeyette shook his head. &quot;C'mon. You don't never dance,&quot;Rochelle insisted. She grabbed one of Lafeyette's hands andbegan to drag him into the group of dancers.   &quot;I don't wanna. I just wanna look,&quot; he protested. Butchildren and adults alike began a quiet chant: &quot;Dance, Lafie,dance. Dance, Lafie, dance.&quot; He did. Reluctantly. His longarms moved tentatively and awkwardly as his upper body movedback and forth in time with the music. Rochelle edged himslower and slower into the middle of the dance floor, where,for just a moment, he let loose, his legs and torso movingwith surprising grace to El Jabbar's raps.   For those few minutes, he was at peace with himself, hisfacial muscles relaxed into a full, unencumbered smile. Hiseyes focused on Craig, whom he considered a friend, not an&quot;associate.&quot; (&quot;I don't have friends,&quot; he once told hismother. &quot;Just associates. Friends you trust.&quot;) Lafeyetteidolized Craig. The older boy's energy and joy had made evenLafeyette momentarily forget about his troubles.   From the porch, Craig smiled and waved at Lafeyette, whichmade him feel self-conscious about dancing. &quot;That's all,&quot; hetold Rochelle. She reached out to grab him, but he snakedthrough the crowd to watch from the sidelines with Rickey andJames. The dancers continued to gyrate and whirl through thehot, humid night. LaJoe, Lafeyette and Pharoah would rememberthis night and the others that Craig deejayed as some of themost spontaneous and spirited fun they had ever had atHorner.   ---   The following February, Lafeyette had looked for Craig atthe Boys Club talent show but couldn't find him. Craig hadturned Lafeyette on to music. Lafeyette now listened tocassettes regularly and would often bring Craig new rap tapesfor him to hear.   A few evenings after the show, Lafeyette heard that Craigwas in the building, visiting his girlfriend, so he wentupstairs to see him. Craig was sitting on the couch, writinga poem. A music tape he'd put together was blaring in thebackground.   &quot;What it is, Laf,&quot; Craig said.   &quot;Hey, Craig.&quot; Lafeyette sat down next to the older boy andwatched him scribble on a sheet of looseleaf notebook paper.   &quot;What you think?&quot; Craig asked, showing Lafeyette the poem.It was entitled &quot;Children of the Future,&quot; and though itsgrammar and spelling were rough, Lafeyette understood itfully. It was an ode to learning. Craig was always tellingLafeyette how important school was.                                                                                                          I can't blame the teacher for teachen   I shoulden criticize the speaken   Because the less I knew the more I weaken   The teacher gave a lesson   If I was there I learned.   What's the use of letting it go to waste win I can showwhat I earned.   I took advanedge of the education   Not advanedge of it being free   If I took advanedge of both   It wouldn't mean much to me                                                                                                          &quot;Straight out,&quot; said Lafeyette, who was tickled thatsomeone older than he would ask for his opinion. Lafeyette soadmired Craig. Despite his kinetic energy, there wassomething soothing about just being around him. Craig toldLafeyette he was going to deejay a party at the Boys Club ina couple of weeks on March 3. He told Lafeyette to stop by.   ---   On Thursday, March 2, winter seemed intent on unleashingsome of its final fury. The day began with a soft, comfortingsnowfall, but by midafternoon, when the temperature rose tothe 20s, the swirling snowflakes turned to hard-drivingdroplets of frozen rain. Coupled with the thin layer of snowalready covering the ground, it made for an icy and slipperyturf.   Craig left work that afternoon and headed directly toHenry Horner to visit his girlfriend. He had graduated fromCregier High School two months earlier and quickly landed ajob as a stockboy at Order from Horder, a stationery storechain. He worked at one of the downtown stores, where heearned $4.50 an hour. Craig so impressed the manager there,Percy Anderson, that he was thinking of training Craig insales. &quot;He caught on fast,&quot; said Anderson.   That evening, Craig briefly visited with his girlfriendand then took the bus home. Craig lived with his uncle andhis uncle's girlfriend in a two-story row house in the ABLAHomes. ABLA, a mile and a half southeast of Horner, is acomplex of four developments: the Jane Addams Homes, theRobert Brooks Homes, Loomis Courts, and the Abbott Homes.ABLA differed from the other projects in that it includedboth high-rises and row houses. The latter, many felt, werepreferable to the 16-story fortresses, but like the tallbuildings, they were in terrible physical condition. What'smore, they were laid out in such a confusing way thatstrangers walking through the maze often got hopelessly lost.   With his customary high spirits, Craig greeted his uncleand his uncle's girlfriend, and placed on a set of speakerstwo albums he had just purchased, Frankie Knuckles's &quot;YouCan't Hide&quot; and Dada Nada's &quot;Haunted House.&quot; He grabbed aturntable needle and two cassette tapes of rap and pop musiche had assembled. He stuffed the tapes and needle in hispockets. Craig always had music with him. During lunch at hisjob, he would sit in back of the store listening to tapes onhis headphones. Tomorrow night was his debut as a deejay atthe Henry Horner Boys Club.   &quot;I'm going right out. To a friend's. Be back real soon,&quot;Craig yelled to his uncle.   &quot;Are you coming right back?&quot; the uncle asked.   &quot;Yeah,&quot; Craig replied as he trotted out the door.   Craig was on his way to pick up two turntables andspeakers from a friend's for tomorrow night's dance at theBoys Club. His uncle, who knew Craig went to bed by 11 everynight, left the door unlocked.                                                                                                          Francis Higgins and Richard Marianos cruised the streetsof ABLA in their unmarked sedan. Higgins, 34, was a Chicagopolice officer assigned to a new gun task force devotedsolely to investigating the illegal shipment of arms. In itsfirst four and a half months, the unit, whose members calledthemselves the Gunbusters, had seized 334 guns. Marianos, 23,was an agent for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, andFirearms, a division of the U.S. Treasury Department. TheBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, or ATF, originatedin the 1920s to battle Prohibition; the famed Eliot Ness wasan ATF agent. But the last illegal still in Chicago wasdiscovered in 1980. Tobacco no longer occupied much of thebureau's time either. Occasionally, the agents capturedillegal interstate shipments of cigarettes.   So, over the last 10 years most of ATF's work had beenfocused on firearms. With the rise in drugs, the weaponry hadbecome sophisticated. The ATF had seen more and moreautomatic weapons, including Uzi machine guns, Mac 10s, andIntertec 9s. Only three weeks earlier, the ATF and theGunbusters, working in tandem, had raided two suburban homes,where they confiscated 23 live grenades, 10 fully automaticmachine guns, 31 handguns, seven sawed-off shotguns, asemi-automatic weapon, a cluster bomb, and thousands ofrounds of ammunition. The police believed these belonged to awest side gang that used the suburban homes as safe houses.This night, though, Marianos and Higgins were looking forsomeone they knew only as &quot;Craig&quot; and who they'd heard hadpurchased a sawed-off shotgun in recent days.   While driving through the labyrinth of ABLA's streets, thetwo officers came on three teen-age boys, including Craig, onthe 1300 block of Thirteenth Street. The boys were on theirway to pick up the stereo equipment. It wasn't clear why thepolice thought they looked suspicious or had any cause tostop them. It was only 8 at night and, though dark, certainlyearly enough for teen-agers to be walking about. One of theboys, Craig Davis, on seeing the two white officers, turnedto one of his friends. &quot;I ain't going to no jail again,&quot; hesaid.   Five months earlier, Craig had been arrested with fourothers for allegedly stealing cookies from a delivery truck.It had been his first arrest and was such an upsettingexperience, he had cried. He had been recording music tapesat a friend's when the police came in on another matter andsaw boxes of chocolate chip cookies in the living room. Thepolice arrested all five boys in the apartment. When Craigwas released the next morning, he told his uncle's girlfriendhe hadn't had anything to do with taking the cookies. He hadjust been at his friend's mixing tapes. Now, with the outcomeof the case still pending, Craig feared the police, so onthis cold night he ran. Craig, everyone said, was alwaysmoving. He took off, and took off fast.   Marianos, only a few years older than Craig, gave chase.Higgins, meanwhile, questioned the remaining two youths. In alater police report, Higgins said they told him the boy whohad run was named Craig. They say, however, that they refusedto give the police Craig's name. Higgins let the two boys goand caught up with his winded partner a couple of blocksaway. Craig had eluded Marianos.   The boys saw Craig one more time. Having outmaneuveredMarianos, Craig was intent on picking up the stereo equipmentfor his big debut the next night. From about a half blockaway, Craig spotted his friends and hollered at them, &quot;Let'sget them turntables]&quot; At that point, the squad car turned thecorner. Marianos got out of the car and resumed the chase.   They ran down one street and up another, then through adarkened breezeway. Marianos lost sight of Craig for &quot;a splitsecond,&quot; according to a later police investigation, and sounholstered his service revolver, a .357 Smith and Wesson.Craig turned to his left to get back to the safety of hisuncle's house. Marianos caught up with him there, grabbed himfrom behind, and shoved him up against the wall.   Marianos had his revolver near Craig's head. He later toldhomicide detectives that Craig struggled, that he &quot;began totwist and turn his body and then reached over his shoulderand made contact&quot; with Marianos's right hand. But the medicalexaminer's report later cited evidence of &quot;soot stainingwithin the wound,&quot; which indicated that the barrel of the gunmay have been pressed up against Craig's skull when itdischarged. Whatever the case, it appeared that Marianosslipped and fell backward onto the fresh sheet of ice, andwhen he did, the Smith and Wesson accidentally discharged.   The pop of the pistol echoed off the brick row houses. Butfew paid much attention to it. There had, after all, beengunshots just about every night in recent weeks.   Craig's mother, Christine Davis, who lived on the 14thfloor of a high-rise just a block away, heard the shot as shereturned from buying cigarettes and a six-pack of beer at alocal store. People started running around her. &quot;They shotsome nigger,&quot; she heard someone say. She hurried to herapartment to avoid the scene that was sure to follow.   Even Daniel Davis, Craig's uncle, thought nothing of thenoise outside his door. &quot;When we heard the shot, we justfigured it was more shooting,&quot; he later said. &quot;They got a lotof shooting around here.&quot; Ten minutes later, when it wasclear from the commotion that someone had indeed been woundedoutside his apartment, he opened the door.   There lay Craig face down in a pool of blood, which seemedstartlingly red and thick against the thin layer of whitesnow and ice.   The police had strung yellow tape from tree to tree tokeep the angry spectators at a distance.   &quot;You shouldn't done that]&quot; someone yelled.   &quot;We see you 'round here, man, we're gonna kill you]&quot; Theanonymous threats rose from the growing crowd.   &quot;Them sons of bitches shot him in cold blood,&quot; oneresident said to another. &quot;They ain't got no reason to havedone that.&quot;   &quot;Man, who care? They don't. It's just another nigger tothem.&quot;   An acquaintance of Craig's banged on his mother's frontdoor. At the same time, she received a phone call from afriend. They both told her, almost simultaneously, that herson had been shot. Christine raced downstairs to thelow-rises, where she learned that Craig was being taken toMount Sinai Hospital, the very place where she had givenbirth to him. Some friends offered to drive her there.   The medical technicians in the ambulance had hooked Craigup to an IV and administered oxygen. They attached him to acardiac monitor, which showed no activity. By the time theygot him to the hospital, Craig had no blood pressure, pulse,or respiration. Four doctors administered cardiac massage.They injected him with adrenaline and atropine in the hopethat they could stimulate the heart. No response. In themeantime, X-rays showed that the bullet, which had enteredthrough the back of the head, had fragmented through bothhemispheres of the brain. Craig Davis was pronounced dead at8:48 p.m.   A spokesman for the ATF told reporters that Craig was aBlack Gangster Disciple and suspected gun-runner. Two dayslater, a one-paragraph account of the shooting appeared inThe Chicago Sun-Times:   &quot;A reputed street gang member was fatally shot Thursdaynight when a federal agent's revolver discharged during ascuffle, investigators said. Craig Davis, 19, of 1262 S.Throop, who was shot once in the head, was pronounced dead atMichael Reese Hospital {sic}. A spokesman for the federalAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms Bureau said the agent and aChicago police gang crimes officer approached Davis tointerview him about illegal firearms trafficking and Davisgrabbed the agent, touching off the scuffle.&quot;   ---   Craig's funeral was nothing like Bird Leg's, a friend ofLafeyette's who, like Craig, had been a source ofcompanionship and who had been killed in a gang battle twosummers before. For starters, the service for Craig was heldat night. And it was conducted at the A.R. Leak Funeral Home,one of the city's oldest and most esteemed black-ownedfuneral homes, a stark contrast to the storefront churchwhere Bird Leg was memorialized. Sam Cooke, the rhythm andblues singers, had been put to rest here, as had FlukeyStokes, a notorious gambler and suspected drug dealer. Over5,000 people had viewed Stokes' body, which lay in a coffinbuilt in the shape of a Cadillac.   Of the funeral home's four chapels, the Mahalia JacksonRoom was the smallest. The room welcomed visitors with ablack-and-white photo of Jackson -- &quot;The World's GreatestGospel Singer,&quot; the caption read -- and was decorated invarying shades of green; the patterned wallpaper in emeraldgreen, the lush carpeting the color of well-watered grass.The room seated 200, but at Craig's funeral an additional 50to 100 mourners stood along the walls, overflowing into thehallway.   Craig, whose head wound had been stuffed with cotton andsutured to prevent any leakage, was dressed in a fitted navyblue suit and light blue shirt and tie, all of which hismother had bought for $154. The casket's baby blue paint jobcontrasted sharply with the dark occasion, but the cheerfulcolor seemed to brighten Craig, who even in death lookedhappy, his lips turned up slightly in a smile.   It was clear from the size of the crowd that Craig hadmany admirers. Six former teachers attended, one of whom hadsaved some of Craig's writings and now planned to have themframed. Those teachers who couldn't attend contributed $100to the family. Children from both ABLA and Henry Horner werethere, as were colleagues from work, including his boss,Percy Anderson. Flowers, almost an entire garden, it seemed,surrounded the casket. One bouquet had been sent by histeachers at Cregier, another by his co-workers at thestationery store. Two bunches had been sent by the residentsof two different high-rises in the public housing complexwhere Craig grew up. And as tradition asked, Craig's motherhad contributed &quot;a bleeding heart,&quot; a set of pink and whitecarnations arranged in the shape of a heart with a cluster ofred roses in the center.   Lafeyette came with his mother, LaJoe, who despisedfunerals as much as her son did. LaJoe knew Craig only fromthe dances in front of the building, but she understood howmuch he had meant to Lafeyette, so she wanted to be here withhim. Lafeyette was older now and had abandoned the corduroysand nylon jacket he wore to Bird Leg's funeral; instead, hewore a dapper blue, high-waisted silk suit that his olderbrother Terence, when he was making money selling drugs, hadhad made for himself. It no longer fit Terence, but clung tothe stick-like frame of Lafeyette as if it had been tailoredfor him. Lafeyette also wore a white, furry Kangol cap,shaped like a golf cap, which made him look older, almost asif he were from a different era. LaJoe wore a gray dressgiven to her by a friend who had outgrown it. Together, theymade a handsome pair.   Pharoah, Lafeyette's 10-year-old brother, chose not tocome. He said it was because he didn't have anything to wear,but more likely he didn't want to be amid all the crying. Hedidn't like to be around sad people, particularly if he knewhe couldn't cheer them up.   Lafeyette's friend, James, who wept when he first heard ofCraig's death, had thought of coming, too. His mother wasthere; in fact, she read the obituary at the opening of theservice. But James turned 15 that day and he felt it wouldbring him bad luck to attend a funeral on his birthday.   In the Mahalia Jackson Room, the crowd was unusuallystill. Few cried. Even fewer yelled out for Craig as they haddone for Bird Leg, who at 15 had been shot by a member of arival gang. Few mentioned Craig's killing, though it wasreferred to once in the sermon, and then only obliquely as&quot;the tragedy.&quot; It was as if friends and family were buryingan older man who had died of natural causes.   The silence, though, extended far beyond the funeral.Silence shrouded Craig's death. Neither the police nor theBureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms had contacted Craig'smother. No phone call of apology or explanation. No letter.No telegram. Not even, Christine thought, flowers. She spentfour days after his death trying to learn what had happened.She visited the police, the state authorities and eventuallythe ATF. But she learned nothing. The ATF told her theycouldn't talk with her because the shooting was underinvestigation. We'll get back in touch with you, they said.They never did.   The ATF continued to tell reporters that Craig had been aBlack Gangster Disciple. One of Craig's teachers angrily saidit was a way to justify his death. Of 18,000 names the policehad on file of people affiliated with the city's west sidegangs, Craig Davis was not among them. Moreover, Craig had nocriminal record as a juvenile and had been arrested only onceas an adult, and that was for allegedly stealing the cookies,a crime he had insisted he hadn't done.   When he died, the medical examiner found no trace ofalcohol or drugs in his blood. His teachers and the principalat Cregier, all of whom thought the world of Craig, knew ofno gang affiliation. Nor did his friends. And, people wouldpoint out, had he been a member of the Black GangsterDisciples he never would have been allowed to visitLafeyette's building, which was controlled by the GangsterStones and the Vice Lords, both rival gangs. Even a policemanwho knew Craig from Horner had only good things to say abouthim.   It wasn't impossible that Craig had purchased a sawed-offshotgun. All the adults knew it was hard to resist the luresof the neighborhood. But no one close to Craig knew anythingabout any gun-running by the boy. Friends said he avoidedhanging out with known drug dealers and gang leaders. Thepolice never produced any evidence. His mother just wanted toknow what happened that night, why they stopped her son. Wasit a case of mistaken identity? Did they have the wrongCraig? Had he, in fact, bought a shotgun? She couldn't findout. Other than the initial press release, the police and theATF refused to say anything about the case. They ruled it anaccidental homicide.   Christine also never heard from the Chicago HousingAuthority, on whose property the killing took place. Theleast they could have done, she thought, was to visit her andoffer her condolences. But the CHA didn't learn of Craig'sdeath until weeks later. The ATF never called them either.Even when CHA officials tried to inquire about it, they couldlearn nothing.   Shortly after the shooting, a police neighborhoodrelations officer did visit with community leaders, but moreto quash rumors -- including one that Craig had been shotwhile handcuffed. Neighbors and friends who now worried aboutthe safety of their own children were afraid to talk aboutthe shooting. Cregier's principal, Ray Gerlik, who believedthat &quot;Craig was done wrong,&quot; urged Craig's friends who hadbeen with him the night of the killing to go to the police,but he had trouble convincing them. They were afraid thatthey themselves might become the subject of an investigation.   &quot;People are scared,&quot; said one friend, a student atCregier. &quot;Who wouldn't be? This is the FBI {sic}. They'd findout where you live. They'd get you before you even testify.&quot;   Neighbors recalled an incident of 20 years earlier with akind of wistfulness. In 1969, the police killed two brothers,Michael and John Soto, and the community rose up in protest,first fighting the police in an hour-long gun battle, thenstaging a series of protests downtown. It was not that theadults who remembered the Soto killings wanted to rise up inarms against the police again. It was just that they achedfor a time when the community had a collective conscience,when neighbors trusted one another and had enough confidencein their own powers of persuasion to demand a better and morepeaceful life. Everyone now seemed timid and afraid. Theirwhispers damning the police and the ATF flutteredweightlessly like leaves in the wind.   The community itself turned inward, sorry for Craig'sfamily, but worried about their own well-being. The majornewspapers ignored the incident. The police and the ATFsimply refused to discuss it, as if by remaining mute theywould somehow make people forget.   The preacher's voice reverberated among the mourners, buthis protestations seemed empty at such a tragic occasion.&quot;Craig was no gang member,&quot; he bellowed, his words barelyreaching the mourners standing in the back. &quot;There is drugs,lots of dope out there, but Craig would have none of that.Oh, he had a temper among friends, but he knew enough to walkaway from trouble.&quot; His voice reached a crescendo; it was theonly moment of untamed anger. &quot;He knew enough to walk awayfrom trouble,&quot; he repeated. &quot;Amen,&quot; some muttered tothemselves. &quot;Amen.&quot;   The minister continued. &quot;But he knew his time had come. Hewas going home. He was going home.&quot; His gravelly, evangelicalvoice called for some response, some cries of sorrow andpain, some recognition of the tragedy, but the room, exceptfor a bawling baby, remained hushed. You could hear peoplefolding the mimeographed programs and shifting in theirchairs, and through the thin walls the cries of a grievingwoman in the room next door.   Lafeyette didn't stay for the service. When he had firstarrived and viewed Craig's body, he pictured the summerevenings spent dancing by the porch, of a laughing and jokingCraig spinning records, his body swaying in time to themusic. He couldn't get out of his mind the image of Craigwaving to him. Each of those evenings was a time when thepresent, the here-and-now, had seemed good enough toLafeyette, one of those rare moments when he wasn't hauntedby the past or worried about the future. Lafeyette couldn'tget those snapshots of memory off his mind.   So, early in the service, he neatly folded the funeralprogram, slipped it into his back pocket and shuffled out ofthe chapel into the crowded hallway, where he slumped into anarmchair. He bent over in the plush gold chair, his chestpulled down to his knees. His face tightened, his expressionbecame flat and vacant. He was unwilling, perhaps unable, tocry. Only his rust-colored eyes offered any hint of hisanguish. Underneath them were two puffy, dark circles. Hespoke to no one. He pulled the silence in around him.   Craig's death, LaJoe believed, broke Lafeyette. From thatday on, she said, he started thinking, &quot;I ain't doingnothing, I could get killed, or if not get killed I might goto jail for something I didn't do. I could die any minute, soI ain't going to be scared of nothing.&quot;   For weeks afterward, LaJoe felt Lafeyette personallycarrying the burden of Craig's death, as if there weresomething he might have done to help his friend. Lafeyetterarely mentioned Craig. He didn't want to talk about him. &quot;Idon't want nothing on my mind,&quot; he would say. Memories forLafeyette became dangerous. He recalled nothing of Bird Leg'sfuneral. He couldn't remember the names of any of theperformers at the Boys Club talent show just last month. Hesometimes had trouble recounting what he had done just theday before in school. Shutting out the past was perhaps theonly way he could go forward or at least manage the present.Besides, he knew, nothing could bring Craig back.   He fell into a deep depression, collapsing in bedimmediately after school and sleeping long hours. And whenthe outward grief diminished in intensity, his distrust ofothers built -- and his memory failed him more. He soonaffected a long, jerky gait in which his upper body leanedforward as if it had been realigned; his eyes locked with theground as if to block out others around him. He no longerlooked 13; his bobbing, cocky walk made him look older.   Many weeks after the funeral, in one of the rare momentswhen Lafeyette talked about Craig, he asserted with acontrolled anger that unnerved those around him: &quot;He wasn'tno gangbanger. They lied. If I was Craig's mama or daddy Iwould of walked up to that police and shot him in the headthe same way he did Craig. I hope the policeman dies.&quot;   ---   LaJoe just noticed it one day. Lafeyette hadn't saidanything about it. On his bedroom wall, he had hung theprogram from Craig's funeral. On its cover was a picture ofCraig in his mortarboard and graduation gown. LaJoe thoughtit a good sign. Other than a few asides here and there, henever talked about Craig. This was the first indication shehad that he was still grieving for him, four months after hisdeath. Maybe, she thought, it would help him get over thesudden loss of his friend.   But two weeks later, LaJoe took the picture down. It hadgiven Lafeyette nightmares. One in particular recurred anumber of times, startling him awake, sometimes drenching himin sweat. It unnerved him just to talk about it. In thedream, someone -- he didn't know who -- was chasing him. Butbecause of a strong wind, he couldn't run away. And when hetried to call for help, nothing came out of his mouth.   ---   It has been two years since Craig Davis was shot andkilled by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agent,and Lafeyette still does not like talking about his friend.The ATF and the police also have remained mum, refusing todiscuss the case. One police official, however, who said hecouldn't talk about the incident, challenged the contentionthat Craig was not a gang member, despite the considerableevidence to the contrary. &quot;Al Capone didn't have a criminalrecord either,&quot; he asserted in a brief phone conversation.   Craig's mother, Christine, has filed a claim of damagesfor wrongful death against ATF agent Richard Marianos and theU.S. government. Twice a year, she visits her son's grave atthe Restvale Cemetery, placing on it a wheel of roses and asmall American flag. The site is unmarked; it can be found bylocating Section A3, Lot 7, Grave 140. She has been unable toafford a tombstone.                                                                                                          Copyright 1991 by Alex Kotlowitz</TEXT></DOC>
