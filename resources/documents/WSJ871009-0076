Hynes president and chief executive officer.    Mr. Hynes, 65 years old, previously held those titles on an acting basis. He replaces Ronald Hammond, one of three top Matrix executives who resigned yesterday, the company said. Matrix also named R.W. Adams as its new chief financial officer. His predecessor, Thomas Fleming Jr., was among the executives who resigned.    Neither Mr. Hammond nor Mr. Fleming could be reached for comment.    A Matrix spokesman said the company's financial statements for the year ended June 30 probably won't be released until early November because of questions about the company's recording of sales.    Matrix makes electrical connectors for the aerospace industry. </TEXT></DOC>
