Historically,gas has had to use innovative marketing in order to be able to competewith other energy sources that had more flexibility in their pricingand other policies (unlike gas, which was more regulated). New developmentsin fuel-efficient equipment, the freeing of gas prices by deregulation,and the public's perception of natural gas as an inexpensive and efficientenergy form have increased the attractiveness of gas in Canada's energymarket. Ongoing efforts to hold and increase this market share includeresearch and development in energy-efficient appliances, developmentof the SMART house concept and R2000 housing, promoting use of naturalgas in industrial boilers and combustion systems, using flexible tubingand plug-in outlets for convenient gas distribution within buildings,and research and development of natural gas fuel cells and natural gas-fuelledvehicles.</TEXT></DOC>
