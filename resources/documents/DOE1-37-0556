The method for the chemicalanalysis of oil pollutions, which has been developed by the DeutschesHydrographisches Institut, has thereby proved to be a successful methodof convicting the guilty polluter, and has proved itself to be reliableeven in the case of thin oil films on the sea. The success of the investigationis decisively dependent upon the condition that the right comparisonsample is taken from the suspect ship; for that reason, the surveillanceof the sea represents a most critical point in convicting polluters.The majority of the oil films detected contained heavy fuel oil or gasoil residues, only a very small part of the samples showed crude oil.The findings emphasize that it is not the oil rig platforms or tankers,but general shipping, which contributes essentially to oil pollutionin the region of the Continental Shelf of the Federal Republic of Germany.</TEXT></DOC>
