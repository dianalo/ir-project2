Shots rang out in the distance while President Raul Alfonsintoured the base later, but authorities said the shots were not aimedat the president or his helicopter.   At least 25 people were killed in fighting after about 40commandos, who the government said were leftist guerrillas, brokethrough the base's main gate in a stolen truck Monday, authoritiessaid.   The state-run Telam news agency said 13 men and one woman leftthe base early this morning, their hands in the air and one waving awhite shirt as a flag of surrender.   It was unclear whether all 14 were involved in the takeover. Thetwo private news agencies, Diarios y Noticias and NoticiasArgentinas, said some may have been hostages.   As the president toured the base, soldiers and police exchangedsporadic gunfire with three men outside the compound _ one in atower, one in a building, and the third in a car. They later chasedthe gunmen, but it was not immediately known if they caught them.   Local news reports said some commandos had also sniped at policeand troops Monday from positions outside the La Tablada base, on thecapital's western outskirts.   The red brick officers' club in which the attackers holed up wasvirtually leveled by tank and mortar fire, and the woman who walkedout this morning was was wounded and had to be carried by twocomrades, Telam reported.   Soldiers took the 14 into custody and entered the bombed-outofficers club, it said.   The battle was the most serious of its kind since an attack bythe leftist People's Revolutionary Party and an allied guerrillagroup on an army arsenal in 1975.   Five soldiers were killed and more than 30 soldiers and policeofficers wounded in Monday's battle, Telam reported. Carlos Becerra,an aide to Alfonsin, said at least 20 commandos were killed.   The commandos either carried with them or stole ground-to-groundmissiles and anti-tank guns, military officials said in explainingthey had held off government forces.   They did not identify themselves or state their motives, but awoman who called Diarios y Noticias on Monday said she belonged tothe group and claimed it had acted to prevent a military coup.   ``It was to defend democracy and now they're massacring us,'' theagency quoted the woman, who would not identify herself, as saying.``Please, do something.''   The popularly elected Alfonsin government has coped with threemilitary insurrections since April 1987, during which `loyalist'troops were extremely reluctant to fire on their rebelliouscolleagues.   The incidents ended with little or no bloodshed. Public sentimenthas strongly backed Alfonsin against rebels in the armed forces,which ruled the country for nearly eight years until he took officein 1983.   During the military dictatorship, at least 8,900 Argentineleftists were arrested by security forces and never seen again. Theyare presumed executed.   The commandos had scattered right-wing pamphlets as they attackedthe base, but the government dismissed the notion they were anythingbut leftist extremists.   Cesar Jaroslavsky, president of the governing Radical CivicUnion's bloc in the House of Deputies, said some commandos weremembers of the Peoples Revolutionary Army, which last battledsoldiers a decade ago.   Inside the base on Monday, the commandos were confined to the redbrick officers club and several other buildings as soldiers blastedtheir positions with tank and mortar fire, setting the buildingsablaze.   Some had fled the base and hid out in nearby buildings, snipingat police and soldiers, local news agencies reported.   At 9:30 p.m., the armory exploded, sending bright flames 100yards high into the darkness. Sporadic gunfire and an occasionalmortar rounds continued inside the compound early today.   The pamphlets thrown out by the commandos they entered the basesaid ``Long Live Rico!'' and ``Long Live Seineldin!'', referring tothe leaders of the three military insurrections.   Cashiered Lt. Col. Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin, bothin military prison, mounted their revolts to press for an end to theprosecution of officers for human rights abuses committed during the1976-83 military dictatorship.</TEXT></DOC>
