Last month, a Texas appeals court panel affirmed $9.1 billion of Pennzoil's $11.1 billion judgment against Texaco Inc. The court's only modification in the whopping award came in its reduction of punitive damages to $1 billion from $3 billion. The ruling was widely viewed as favorable to Pennzoil and the company at the time expressed &quot;delight&quot; and &quot;gratitude&quot; at the fact that the court upheld the overwhelming part of the award.    In a recent filing in the appeals court, however, Pennzoil asked the court to reinstate the full $3 billion in punitive damages. Pennzoil said its request was in part a formality that would preserve its right to the full award when Texaco appeals the judgment to the Texas Supreme Court. But Pennzoil also stated that it thinks it has a right to every penny of the original award it won when a jury found that Texaco unlawfully interfered with Pennzoil's merger agreement with Getty Oil Co. when Texaco acquired Getty in 1984.    &quot;I'm not in the habit of giving away $2 billion,&quot; said Joe Jamail, Pennzoil's chief counsel; &quot;$2 billion here, $2 billion thereafter a while it begins to add up.&quot;    Mr. Jamail said that even when the reduction of $2 billion in damages is taken into account, the judgment now totals $10.3 billion when the accrued interest is included.    But Texaco contends that by seeking to have the $2 billion reinstated, Pennzoil had signaled its refusal to comply with the appeals court ruling. And as a result of what it calls Pennzoil's &quot;conditional compliance,&quot; Texaco has moved that the entire case should be retried in a lower court. &quot;Some states say you can't have your cake and eat it too,&quot; said Russell McMains, a Texaco attorney who specializes in appellate procedures.    Texaco acknowledged that it was attacking on a highly technical point that isn't clearly settled in Texas law. But the latest skirmish clearly indicates the intensity of the dispute between the two companies, with Pennzoil scrambling for every cent it can get, and Texaco pursuing every legal remedy it can muster.    &quot;We will plow every field,&quot; said Mr. McMains.    Lawyers not directly involved in the case also said that Texaco appeared to be taking a chance on a long shot. &quot;It sounds to me like the 'grasp at any straw' approach to the situation, which is where Texaco is at this point in the case,&quot; said Frank W. Morgan, a lawyer here who formerly was associate general counsel for Gulf Corp., now a Chevron Corp. unit. &quot;It sounds highly technical.&quot;    Texaco's latest legal attack is based upon the language buried on page 161 in the appellate panel's opinion. The court conditioned the denial of Texaco's motion for new trial upon Pennzoil's agreement to voluntarily drop $2 billion in punitive damages from the judgment. Pennzoil at that point indicated it would readily comply with the appellate court ruling.    Pennzoil later filed a document called a remittitur in which it agreed to drop $2 billion -- but it also made known its reservations. In the document, Pennzoil said it reserved the right to seek a rehearing on the reduction in damages. Subsequently, Pennzoil filed a motion for rehearing of the punitive damages issue, contending that the court had &quot;erroneously applied the Texas law, and inappropriately embraced&quot; certain principles of New York law, which was also used in the case.    Pennzoil's Mr. Jamail contended that Texaco's latest move to have the judgment overturned was a sign of the company's desperation. &quot;If they had a good case, they wouldn't have to reach this deep into the barrel,&quot; said Mr. Jamail. &quot;It's ludicrous.&quot;    Texaco acknowledged that its latest legal attack was out of the ordinary, but said that wasn't surprising considering the high stakes involved in the case. &quot;Since there's never been a judgment of this size before, I suspect that anything is unusual,&quot; said Mr. McMains. </TEXT></DOC>
