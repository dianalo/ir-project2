His point aboutproduction following research and development (even if it islimited) is absolutely valid. With the high-tech weaponrythat we enjoy today, we must produce and test followingdevelopment of a particular weapons system.   As a retired soldier with some experience, I salute Mr.Weiss. He has said it all in a most articulate and capableway. I hope the right folks take time to read it.</LP><TEXT>   George S. Patton   Major General   U.S. Army (Ret.)
