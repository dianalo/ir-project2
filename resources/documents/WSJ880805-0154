Michael Amick was named to the newly created post of vice president for environment and health. He had been vice president for quality management, a position that wasn't filled. Last month, without admitting or denying the charges, this paper-products concern paid an $872,220 fine to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for alleged safety and health violations at a plant. A company spokesman said the appointment wasn't a result of the federal government's action, but part of &quot;an ongoing commitment&quot; to safety and health issues. </TEXT></DOC>
