It was the fourth bombing in a week.   The president of the Honduran Congress was quoted as saying thewave of bombings was linked to drug trafficking and was not the workof leftist guerrillas.   ``The government strongly condemns the criminal acts that haveseriously injured people and public property, affected social peaceand provoked uncertainty among the population,'' said a statementissued by President Jose Azcona Hoyo's office.   It said the government regrets ``the harm suffered by innocentvictims in terrorist attacks that are not usual in Honduran life(and) undoubtedly are provoked by enemies of the democratic andconstitutional system that reigns in the country.''   In a radio interview, armed forces commander Gen. HumbertoRegalado said he had ordered security forces to begin``high-security'' operations to combat the violence in Honduras thepast two months. He did not give details.   Police have set up roadblocks to check vehicle registrations, andsecurity forces in the capital have stepped up vigilance at allpublic offices.   The announcements followed a pre-dawn attack Thursday on theoffices of the Standard Fruit Company, a subsidiary of Castle andamp;Cooke, in La Ceiba, about 280 miles north of Tegucigalpa.   Three people in a passing car tossed the bomb, damaging theoffices, police said. No one was injured.   Police said they had no suspects in the attack.   A bomb ripped through City Hall in Tegucigalpa on Tuesday night,injuring 10 people and damaging nearly half the structure, policesaid.

Another bomb exploded Monday night in the building housingoffices of the Interior Department in the capital. No injuries werereported.   On Saturday, a crude bomb thrown at the rear of a bus carryingU.S. servicemen north of Tegucigalpa injured three soldiers and twoHonduran civilians.   No one claimed responsibility for any of the attacks.   Carlos Montoya, president of the Honduran Congress, was quotedThursday as suggesting the bombings were not the work of leftistguerrillas.   ``The recent bomb attacks weren't done by leftist guerrillas, butrather are related to conflicts of an internal order,'' Montoya toldTegucigalpa newspapers.   ``This terrorist escalation in the country has a domesticcharacter. It's linked to what happened in the Central Penitentiaryand to drug trafficking, not a political-ideological problem,''Montoya said. He did not elaborate.
