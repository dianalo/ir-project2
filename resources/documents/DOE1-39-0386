Large bribes were paid to employeesof the nuclear industry and government inspectors to allow this illicittransport to carry on over a number of years. It is not yet clear wherethe plutonium came from or where it was going. The suggestion that itmay have been sold to Libya or Pakistan for nuclear weapons is very damagingto the nuclear safety argument. Even if the plutonium was being disposedof because it could not be accounted for, the safeguard procedures donot give confidence to the European public more aware of nuclear safetythan ever.</TEXT></DOC>
