It was the deadliest bombing in South Africa in morethan a year.   The lunch-hour blast went off at 1:30 p.m. outside a branch ofthe Standard Bank in Roodepoort, a city bordering the west side ofJohannesburg. Three black men and a white woman were killed.   The explosion followed four other bombings in the past two weekswhich authorities have blamed on the African National Congressguerrilla movement.   The ANC had no immediate comment on the bombing, but issued astatement from its headquarters in Lusaka, Zambia, saying the monthof June ``must be a period of united and decisive popularoffensive'' against the government.   The statement endorsed a three-day, anti-apartheid protestscheduled to start on Monday, saying South Africa's economy ``mustgrind to a halt'' on those days.   A Roodepoort police spokesman, Maj. Tiene Halgryn, said eightpeople were seriously injured in the explosion, including twowhites and six blacks. He said 11 other people suffered lesserinjuries.   Police said most of the victims apparently were waiting at astreet corner for a traffic light to change when the explosionoccurred.   The blast shattered at least a dozen windows in the bank, aswell as windows in nearby stores, and glass was strewn across anearby intersection in Roodepoort's central business district.Police said the explosive device was a small limpet mine, which canbe attached to another object, and they conducted a search forother bombs after cordoning off the area.   A majority of the bombings blamed on the ANC have involvedlimpet mines. Posters in government buildings around the countryshow pictures of these devices and encourage members of the publicto be on the lookout for them.   The death toll from today's explosion was the highest from abombing in South Africa since four white policemen were killed by acar bomb outside a Johannesburg courthouse in May 1987.   It was the fifth bombing reported in the Johannesburg-Pretoriaarea in a nine-day span. Only one of the other blasts causedinjuries _ a mine placed in a flower box in Pretoria which explodedMay 26, injuring four white women.   Police have blamed the blasts on the outlawed ANC, which haswaged a bombing and sabotage campaign since 1961 as part of itsefforts to topple the white-controlled government. The ANC hasneither confirmed nor denied responsibility for the recent bombings.   Today's ANC statement said the group had distributed leaflets inSouth Africa endorsing the nationwide protest planned Mondaythrough Wednesday by anti-apartheid labor unions, church groups andother activists.   The groups organizing the protest in South Africa are prohibitedby law from promoting a general strike, but it is expected that theprotest will take that form. Government officials and employershave warned that workers who participate face dismissal or legalaction.   The protest is intended to oppose the bannings of majoranti-apartheid organizations and other government moves againstopposition trade unions, newspapers and individual activists.   Under apartheid, South Africa's 26 million blacks have no votein national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy andmaintain separate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
