The report predicted that the number of banks will fall to7,300 from about 9,500, mainly because of the acquisition ofbanks with less than $1 billion in assets. The survey of 250chief executives and regulators was taken by AndersenConsulting, a unit of the accounting firm Arthur Andersen andamp;Co., and the Bank Administration Institute, a Chicagoresearch organization.</LP><TEXT>   Large banks are expected to grow, with the number ofsuper-regional banks -- those with between $25 billion and$100 billion in assets -- jumping to 40 from 25 currently. Asthe merger wave accelerates, the number of even larger banks-- those in excess of $100 billion in assets -- is expectedto grow to ten from the four now in existence or soon to beformed from already announced mergers.   The survey warned that the industry's core consumerdeposit base could be cut sharply by the continuedcompetitive pressure from money-market mutual funds and othernonbank savings products.   Larger banks are expected to lose the most jobs. Mostchief executives expect the number of corporate lendingofficers, once the mainstay of commercial banking, to shrinkby 20%. The expected total reduction of 250,000 bankemployees by 2000 is also about 20% of the current total.   &quot;The golden age of banking will not return,&quot; the reportconcludes.   Contrary to the consensus view that new capital is waitingto be deployed in banking, the survey suggests there will bea scarcity of fresh capital from outside investors because ofthe low returns banking has generated in the last decade.Two-thirds of those surveyed believe the industry lackssufficient capital. The return on equity for the mid-1980shas averaged around 8.0%, the study says, because of excesscapacity -- too many banks and branches. Chief executivesbelieve that consolidation in the banking industry willresult in higher earnings for the surviving players, and thatretained earnings will become a major source of new capital.   &quot;The industry must be prepared for a significant change inits cost structure,&quot; said Waino H. Pihl, a partner atAndersen Consulting.   A concern of the authors is a continued shift away frombanks as vehicles for savings and checking services. Theindustry's core deposit base is at risk from mutual funds,pension funds, and the securities industry. The authors warnthat if current trends continue, the share of householdassets in bank accounts could plunge to 13% in 2000, from 27%in 1991.   &quot;Banks may underestimate the extent to which they arevulnerable to nonbank competition,&quot; the study warns.   By the end of the decade, the increasing presence andinfluence of foreign banks is expected to accelerate. Foreignbanks are expected to increase their share of U.S. financialassets to 30% from 23%. As pending legislation opens the wayfor geographic and product diversification in the U.S., theauthors believe foreign banks will be well-suited to competebecause they have faced less restriction in their homemarkets.   Among bank executives surveyed, roughly 80% favor theelimination of &quot;too big to fail,&quot; the doctrine that allowsthe bailout of large banks because of concern over the safetyand soundness of the financial system. By comparison, 80% ofthe 20 banking regulators surveyed favor its retention.</TEXT></DOC>
