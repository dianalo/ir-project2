Overseas, I hit a coveted Trilateral Commission trifecta-- anticipating rapid victory in Iraq, the withering away ofthe Soviet state, and a fast-track for Mexican free trade.</LP><TEXT>   At home, I performed about as well as the economy: We bothexpected more from George Bush than he delivered. Readersoffended by my views during the year can gloat over thisDelphic embarrassment from June 7: &quot;The Domestic Doormat Eralooks to be ending. The civil-rights clash -- so far a bigvictory for Mr. Bush -- is one sign of growing White Housebackbone.&quot; Hallucinations of this magnitude can only comefrom inhaling vapors in the vicinity of former White HouseChief of Staff John Sununu. I've since put a, well, quota onbackground interviews.   Misguided optimism was a recurrent theme. On May 3, Iasked seriously if New York Gov. Mario Cuomo could &quot;become aJFK pro-growth Democrat?&quot; Readers from New York were amused,if not impressed, by my naivete. I gave too much anticipatorycredit on June 21 to West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller'sexpected run for the White House. At least my blunders arebipartisan.   Undaunted, though not unhumbled, let's continue the marchof folly with forecasts for 1992:   The state of the economy by November will be?   Selling the Bush economy short since 1989 would have mademe prescient; I chose hope over pragmatism. The fourth yearof a first presidential term is not the time to break aperfect record. Bet on a recovery finally breaking through,fueled by Alan Greenspan's nomination-saving interest-ratecuts and a reduction in the capital-gains tax rate. Investorwarning: Most journalists aren't rich for nothing.   With the Soviet threat gone, the world will be frettingabout?   The death of Deng Xiaoping and internal revolt in China; aresumption of terrorism, as Saddam Hussein reminds U.S.voters that Mr. Bush didn't remove him from power; a Russianeconomic implosion following the IMF-imposed ruble float inJanuary; trade friction caused by a global boom in exports,the pain of prosperity. The answer is all of the above.   KGB secrets revealed in the Russian press, furthervindicating Cold Warriors, will include?   Choose your evil empiricism: &quot;Yellow rain&quot; in Asia and&quot;anthrax&quot; at Sverdlovsk were both part of a vast Sovietbiological weapons program; James Angleton was right aboutthe high-ranking Soviet mole in the U.S. government; Brezhnevthreatened to nuke China if it pressed its war with Vietnamin 1979; or Andropov knew about the attempted murder of thepope. My guess is biological weapons.   The most amazing political event of 1992 will be?   Paul Tsongas's dark horse victory in February's NewHampshire primary; Dan Quayle's debate romp over theDemocratic vice-presidential nominee, Bob Kerrey; PresidentBush's rally to win from a 15-point deficit after theDemocratic convention, running on a polarizing &quot;High Noon inAmerica&quot; theme; the defeat of GOP Rep. Newt Gingrich in hisnew Georgia district; or the toppling of at least a dozenSenate incumbents, including Connecticut's Chris Dodd andColorado's Tim Wirth. Go with the Senate.   The dominant issue in campaign 1992 will be?   Discount the once intimidating, &quot;Who Lost Gorbachev?&quot;question; voters understand he lost himself. Other candidatesare Republican Pat Buchanan's anti-immigrant Tortilla Curtainwith Mexico; Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin's samuraiprotectionism; or Bob Kerrey's national health insurance. No,the big issue will be who can make the Beltway insiders cleanup their act, the message carried by Arkansas Gov. BillClinton. The Bush team will counter with: Do we really wantanother inexperienced southern governor in the White House?   The next member of the Bush team to leave will be?   The leading candidates are: Treasury Secretary Brady,after learning what the president's son, George W. Bush,heard about his performance while asking about Mr. Sununu;Budget Director Dick Darman, after admitting to HUD SecretaryJack Kemp that Mr. Kemp has been right all along about taxes;domestic aide Roger Porter, who will return to Harvard toteach a course on &quot;The policy process in the Bush WhiteHouse&quot;; or big-thinker Jim Pinkerton, to consult forDemocrats who are stealing his ideas. Dream on. The answer isnone of the above.   Conservatives will be steamed at George Bush for?   Rarely mentioning the word &quot;abortion&quot; during the 1992campaign; raising the top income tax rate to 35% or higher asthe price for getting a cut in the capital-gains tax;approving, in principle, national health insurance; orreauthorizing the independent counsel statute withoutcovering Congress. Relax; in 1992, he'll only raise the toprate.   Rising political star?   Dave McCurdy, Oklahoma Democrat and House intelligencecommittee chairman, will emerge as a voice for glasnost inpost-Cold War intelligence gathering.   Falling political star?   Following the banking bill debacle, Texas Democrat HenryGonzalez will lose his House Banking Committee chair afterthe election.   Oh, yes, the big one: My crystal ball says George Bushbeats Bill Clinton in a surprisingly close race. On the otherhand, I've overestimated this president before.</TEXT></DOC>
