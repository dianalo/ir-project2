Is smoltingactually involved in the survival process? Intuitively, it would seemso. Why should the fish go through such complicated changes unless thereis some survival advantage? But many recent studies have cast doubt onthis relationship. Evidence in recent years suggests that smolting isnot the entire story. Upwelling, density of fish in the ocean, food supply,ocean temperature, all can influence survival, and these have littleto do with the smolting process. It seems more logical that populationsof anadromous fish should have developed an asynchronous timing mechanismthat causes fish to reach the ocean over a range of times that bracketthe times of optimum ocean conditions. Results are presented from experimentsthat began as early as 1976, attempting to relate smolt indices to releasetimes that promote survival to adulthood. Test organism is coho salmonreleased from two Columbia River hatcheries.</TEXT></DOC>
