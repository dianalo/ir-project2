American Savings, Miami, said the suit, which seeks class-action status, names as defendants the thrift; its directors; a former director; Kinder-Care, a Montgomery, Ala., holding company; and certain Kinder-Care affiliates.    The thrift said the suit asserts, among other things, that the price to be paid by Kinder-Care is inadequate.    American Savings said it didn't have any additional information about Fairbear. It said it will vigorously defend the suit, which is the third to be filed seeking to block the acquisition.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American Savings closed at $15.625 a share, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
