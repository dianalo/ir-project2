Stabilized cellulosic insulation is producedby adding water at the time of installation to dry loose-fill cellulosicinsulation containing adhesive. Insulation thickness measurements weremade at the time of installation, at the end of the construction process,and after over-the-road transport. Insulation densities were measuredfor newly installed material at the factory and after the units had beentransported. The average overall reduction in attic insulation thicknesswas found to be about 5%, with most of the reduction occurring duringmanufacturing. The product densities were found to be greater than thelabel values of 2.0 lb/ft{sup 3} both initially and after transport.The reduction in R-value due to decreased thickness was calculated tobe in the range of 2.65 to 5.1%. 4 refs., 3 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
