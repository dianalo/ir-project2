RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court issued a free-speech rulingThursday that gives public officials more power to ban advertisingand sales pitches _ including the peddling of cookware in collegedormitories.   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the court in a 6-3 decision,said government restrictions on commercial speech may be valid evenif they ``go beyond the least restrictive means to achieve thedesired end.''   As long as the rules are ``reasonable (and) narrowly tailored toachieve the desired objective ... we leave it to governmentaldecision makers to judge what manner of regulation may best beemployed,'' Scalia said.   By contrast, the least-restrictive test remains in force forother forms of expression _ particularly political speech.   The court acted in the case of a ban on cookware sales oncampuses of the State University of New York, SUNY.   While the justices said university officials may place somerestrictions on commerical activity on campus, they left unansweredanother issue raised by the case _ whether the univeristy's ban istoo broad because it also limits non-commercial speech.   The justices said a lower court should study that issue.   The three dissenters, Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J.Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, said the rules involvingnon-commercial speech do go too far.   Blackmun said the ban could prevent a student from meeting hisdoctor or lawyer in his dorm room if the doctor or lawyer is paidfor the visit. It could even prevent a student from paying a musicteacher or a speech therapist to come to the dorm room for tutoring,Blackmun said.   The court, he said, is turning its back on its own free-speechprecedents.   ``The majority holds that `least-restrictive means' analysis doesnot apply to commercial speech cases, a holding it is able to reachonly by recasting a good bit of contrary language in our pastcases,'' Blackmun said.   However, Scalia said Thursday's ruling was in line with a 1986decision that allowed Puerto Rico to ban advertising promotingcasino gambling that was aimed at Puerto Rican residents.   Scalia also cited a week-old ruling in which the court made iteasier for communities to turn down the volume at rock concerts. Inthat decision, the court upheld a New York City rule thatrock-concert sponsors use a sound system operated by acity-designated engineer.   The SUNY board of trustees adopted a rule in 1966 to prohibitmost commercial enterprises from operating on campuses.   The ban was challenged by American Future Systems Inc., ahousewares company in Bryn Mawr, Pa., after one of itsrepresentatives was arrested in 1982 at the campus in Cortland,N.Y., for refusing to leave a dorm.   The housewares company attracts customers by offering freeFlorida vacations to students who arrange sales demonstrations intheir dormi rooms for groups of their friends.   A federal judge upheld the SUNY ban, but the 2nd U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals overturned the ruling last year. The appeals courtordered further hearings to determine whether there might be lessrestrictive rules to accomplish the university's purpose.   SUNY's appeal was supported by university officials in 10 statesand groups representing thousands of college administratorsnationwide.   ``The fundamental right of state colleges and universities tocontrol the use of their premises is at issue,'' said afriend-of-the-court brief filed by the university officials fromCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, SouthCarolina, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Vermont.   The appeal also was supported by the American Council onEducation, the American Association of State Colleges andUniversities, the National Association of State Universities andLand Grant Colleges and the National Association of StudentPersonnel Administrators.   Also Thursday, the court ruled in a case from Washington state,limiting the power of Indian tribes to use zoning laws to controlland owned by non-Indians within a reservation's boundaries.   The court said tribes may be forced to share the zoning powerwith state or county officials.</TEXT></DOC>
