The two authors, Maine senators William Cohen and GeorgeMitchell, conclude that the Republican nominee should have beenaware that an arms-for-hostages deal with Iran was being arrangedand that he endorsed it. Cohen, a Republican, and Mitchell, aDemocrat, were members of the congressional Iran-Contrainvestigating panel and the first insiders to write their own bookabout the probe.   ``The vice president endorsed the sale of weapons to Iran eitherout of loyalty to the president or because he, too, was consumed bythe passion to obtain the freedom of the hostages,'' the twosenators wrote in the book, ``Men of Zeal: A Candid Inside Story ofthe Iran-Contra Hearings.''   Questioned Monday during the vice president's campaign stop inTennessee, Chief of Staff Craig Fuller said the book providednothing new on Bush's role in the affair.   ``I don't believe there are any new insights contained in thebook ... it's more a readable version of information that wasgleaned from thousands of hours of hearings that were conducted,''Fuller said. ``We've seen nothing new on the vice president.''   Bush has sought to put the affair behind him, saying repeatedlythat while he nominally was President Reagan's anti-terrorismchief, he was ``out of the loop'' on the Iran matter and didn'tunderstand a briefing on the arrangements he received in August1986, more than three months before the affair became public.   But he also has refused to talk about any discussions withReagan about the matter. Cohen and Mitchell write that while it ispossible Bush cautioned against the deal, evidence shows others inthe administration were convinced that the vice president supportedit.   And they voice the opinion that even if Bush was not broughtinto the decision-making on this major foreign policy initiative,``his position (of support) would have remained the same.''   The book breaks little new ground about the hearings, but addsthe perspective of two seasoned politicians on issues such asBush's awkward political position as Reagan's No. 2, the mistakesmade by the investigating panels in rushing the probe to beatdeadlines and negotiating with cagey defense lawyers, and thepanels' naive underestimation of how the hearings would play ontelevision.   The senators note that no sitting vice president since MartinVan Buren in 1836 has been elected president, in part because ofthe conflict between the vice president's perceived role as secondin command and the reality that he usually is relegated to thesidelines.   ``Whatever his personal views, the vice president cannotpublicly disagree with the president's policies or action withoutfracturing the bond of unity they must maintain,'' they wrote.``The vice president lacks flexibility to express his views even inprivate Cabinet-level sessions ...''   In recounting the highlights of last summer's hearings and thejockeying that went on behind the scenes, the authors note thefrustration of being interrupted constantly by House and Senatefloor votes and the lack of time to prepare for each new witness.   The initial blunder, they contend, was allowing retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard Secord to become the leadoff witness forthe televised hearings, abandoning plans for a panel of ``wisemen'' to first lay out for viewers the way in which covertintelligence operations are normally _ and legally _ conducted andoverseen.   Public reaction soon showed that Secord, the operative who ranmuch of the Iran arms deal and the diversion of profits toNicaragua's Contra rebels, came off looking patriotic while theinvestigators ``had been perceived as hostile, belligerent,pompous, patronizing or unpatriotic,'' they said.   Later, using the panels' own deadlines against them, lawyers forLt. Col. Oliver North put their client before the televisioncameras largely on his own terms. ``The committee had caved in,''the senators concluded. When North testified, he ``held a Gatlinggun while we sat like ducks in a shooting gallery. The Americanpeople loved it. A real Rambo had come to Washington.''   The authors also point out several issues that investigatorswere unable to fully pursue, including Israel's role in the initialopening to Iranians that paved the way for the arms deals, detailedaccounting of the finances of Secord's ``Enterprise'' and theactivities of former CIA Director William Casey, who died on thesecond day of hearings and was never interviewed.   The book, published by Viking, will be available in bookstoresthis week.</TEXT></DOC>
