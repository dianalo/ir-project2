Interestingly enough, one still sees some very successful executives who don't have college degrees. They are survivors with good track records who possess qualities that allow them to compete successfully with and even surpass not only the B.A.s sitting next to them, but even colleagues with Harvard MBAs.    I grew up in a home where my college savings account was established even before my birth. The first words of advice I remember hearing were: &quot;You must get a college degree if you are ever to amount to anything.&quot; In my case, I think my parents were correct. I needed that sage advice. But what about those who do not? What are they made of? What makes them climb to the top and stay there? And what can we learn from them?    It is my job to conduct daily telephone interviews with chief executive officers, chief operating officers, division presidents and senior vice presidents of companies throughout the U.S., Canada and Europe. I ask them mainly about their backgrounds, and I am constantly amazed at the number who have reached higher rungs on the corporate ladder without college degrees. Looking at the notes I've taken of these conversations over the past decade, I see several things these unusual men and women have in common.    First, they are bright to very bright. They are not necessarily brilliant (a few are), nor are they, for the most part, academic in style. They are often down-to-earth and direct. Their intelligence comes through the telephone with little fluff and few extraneous words -- they tend to be good communicators. Words and thoughts flow from them -- some in impeccable English, some with a few grammatical errors; but they're always able to express themselves well.    Second, they are seldom job-hoppers. In their early years they are afraid to leave a job because they know what everyone from recruiters to future employers would ask: &quot;Where did you get your degree?&quot; So, they stay where they are rather than face that awkward question. Their track records, not their schooling, become their &quot;credentials.&quot; They usually dwell on the results of the last quarter or on last year's bottom line rather than on their glory days 20 years ago. You never have to ask them, &quot;But what have you done lately?&quot; because what they have done lately is all they talk about.    And because they hesitate to put themselves on the job market as often as their more &quot;educated&quot; counterparts, a good percentage of people without degrees have been through bad times with a company and have helped it return to a prosperous operation. They tend to stick it out and help their companies recover. Quite a difference from the Ivy Leaguer who is forever asking, &quot;Will this move help my resume?&quot; In short, these non-degree types who have climbed to senior positions rarely jump ship in a business storm.    Third, in their early years they tend to be too impatient or too busy to go to college. Ask them how they started, and the answer often goes like this: &quot;Well, at 14 I was sweeping out the stock room, and then I became a clerk, then a department manager, a merchandiser, after that a district manager, then a regional manager, and then up, up, up.&quot; If you can pull it out of them, they are still quite proud of how they went to work at an early age. The work ethic runs strong in this type. Many fall into the workaholic category. (Perhaps some are overcompensating for lack of a B.A. -- I'll leave that to the psychologists.)    But what really causes these people to climb to the top and stay there is probably a combination of the above characteristics along with some other, hidden factors in each of them that are known only to them, their Creator or their Aunt Martha. Maybe part of it is being reared in a country that doesn't cut them off at the ankles at age 12 or 14 for not passing some arbitrary, palm-sweating exams.    Nevertheless, one has to wonder how many creative and talented people we may be overlooking because they lack college-board scores or other academic credentials. I think recruiters need to be more open-minded in this regard. I can't remember how many times I've heard executive-search people say, &quot;I'm not going to fly to Chicago to see that guy. He doesn't have a degree.&quot; I say, &quot;But look how he has turned that division around. He made it profitable!&quot; And the recruiter responds, &quot;But you know this client . . . the whole company is so well educated.&quot;    It's not really the fault of the recruiters -- they are on retainer to follow certain specifications. And how many specs read, &quot;College degree required,&quot; &quot;Master's preferred,&quot; &quot;CPA and/or MBA necessary&quot;? Many good people must fall through the cracks between these particular floorboards.    And yet there appears to be a trend in executive recruiting toward putting greater emphasis on a candidate's track record. Window dressing is wonderful, but recruiters are pressing for hard data on accomplishments as never before. This allows the best to move up even if they lack high grade-point averages and magna cum laude veneers.    I have tried to become a broader-minded person in the past decade and learn from the high achievers who rose to CEO, senior vice president of marketing, vice president of management information systems or group vice president without attending -- or, at least, finishing -- college. I have listened to them as carefully as I could, and am wiser for it. And yet I hear myself saying on the telephone to my 20-year-old son -- whom I have sent off to college -- &quot;Listen, son, if you don't finish that degree, you won't amount to anything.&quot; Cliches die hard.    ---   Ms. Shireman is a partner in an independent research-for-recruiting practice in San Francisco. </TEXT></DOC>
