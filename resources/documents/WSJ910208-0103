Five days later, business picked upsubstantially,&quot; he added.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Macke said Dayton Hudson is planning a &quot;veryconservative spring&quot; selling season, reflecting the war aswell as the slowdown in consumer confidence. Sales at DaytonHudson stores open at least one year increased 1.2% inJanuary and were up 3.5% for 1990.   &quot;Sales were sluggish in the first few days directlyfollowing the war basically because people were attached totheir televisions,&quot; said W. Barry Thomson, vice president,public affairs, at Woolworth Corp. &quot;Since then, business hasbeen soft, which also reflects continuing weak economicconditions.&quot; He said that anything related to the U.S. flaghas been in strong demand at Woolworth stores, includingyellow ribbons with flags on them. Comparable store sales inJanuary rose 0.5%.   A spokesman for J.C. Penney Co. in Dallas said businesswas somewhat better in the first week of January than in therest of the month, an indication that the war hurt thecompany's business.   &quot;It affected our catalog operations more than the storesthemselves, but revenues also fell off at store level in thelatter part of the month.&quot; Comparable store sales at J.C.Penney were down 3% in January, and down 0.3% for the year.   Kurt Barnard, publisher of Barnard's Retail MarketingReport, said consumer retrenchment and the Gulf war &quot;playedhavoc&quot; with retailers in January. &quot;Upscale retailers havebeen particularly vulnerable,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;Only storesthat feature moderate prices like the Gap and Wal-Mart havedone well.&quot;   Although Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., J.C. Penney and CarterHawley Hale Stores Inc. reported sales decreases in January,most retailers did better than analysts expected. Still, theoutlook for the rest of the year remains cloudy, with someobservers frankly gloomy while others suggest that pent-upconsumer demand will boost revenues in the second half.   &quot;Retailers generally performed fairly well,&quot; said RobertF. Buchanan, an analyst with Alex. Brown andamp; Sons Inc.,Baltimore. &quot;Our comparable store sales index for 15 bigchains was up 1.8% for the month. Apparel sales wereparticularly strong.&quot;   Mr. Buchanan said Wal-Mart Stores Inc. was especiallyaggressive with its apparel pricing. The retailer loweredJanuary prices at its discount stores even more than in thepast, he said, helping to boost corporate revenue 36% for themonth. Sales at stores open one year were up 11% in January,slightly better than planned. &quot;Wal-Mart lowered prices inorder to gain market share,&quot; he said, adding, &quot;It's a trendthat will emerge throughout the year.&quot;   Jeffrey Feiner, an analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., saidhe expects retail sales for the year to increase about 4.5%,about the same rate as in 1990. &quot;We aren't likely to seesignificant improvement in consumer spending and retail salesuntil the latter part of 1991,&quot; he said.   At Sears Roebuck, comparable store sales decreased 3.2%for January, and were up only 0.6% for all of 1990. Mr.Buchanan said home appliances, home improvement and homefashions all performed worse than anticipated. Only theautomotive department was strong, he said. In addition,apparel sales, an area in which Sears is attempting toimprove, were down about 5%.   At Limited Inc., comparable stores sales declined 4% forthe five weeks ended Feb. 2 and were up only 3% for the 52weeks ended Feb. 2. &quot;Their business was disappointing,&quot; saidJeffrey Edelman, an analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Inc.in New York. &quot;Comparable store sales at the Limited divisionwere down about 12%, and as they've had a management changethere, I don't think we'll see any changes in merchandisinguntil fall.&quot;   Gap Inc., a leading specialty retailer, continued toperform well. Comparable store sales were up 6% for thefive-week period ended Feb. 2, while same stores sales wereahead 14% for fiscal 1990.   ---                 Five-week January period                                                                                                                                  a-'91 sales   '90 sales     b-%                             millions     millions   change                                                                                                          Wal-Mart-c .............. $2,495.0     $1,837.0    36.0%   Kmart-e .................  2,353.5      2,110.9    11.5   J.C.
