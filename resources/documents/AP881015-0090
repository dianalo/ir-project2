Death from starvation is an everyday occurrence in the refugeecamps, although the toll has tapered off to 10 daily from 80 a dayin July and August, the worst months in a summer that some reliefofficials say took up to 10,000 lives.   The tiny town of Abyei, 500 miles southwest of Khartoum, hasbecome a gathering place for people dispossessed in a bitter civilwar that is largely ignored by the world.   Just beyond the reach of the fighting, it also became the targetof a U.S.-financed supply mission aiming to airlift 90 tons of foodin a 10-day period that began Thursday.   ``The people in Abyei are totally emaciated,'' said Cole Dodge,Khartoum representative of UNICEF, the U.N. children's fund.   ``There are old people, women and children, a few wearingragged, short and wide shifts, while the rest are naked. They livein African grass-and-stick huts, huddled together,'' he said.   Dodge said 820,000 people have fled the war into camps or otherhavens in Sudan or neighboring Ethiopia. Of those, 65,000 arereceiving relief in the western regions of Darfur and southernKordofan, where Abyei is located.   Twin-engine Cessna planes fly three flights daily from the aridtown because local air-charter companies have no larger cargoplanes available and Abyei's tiny airfield can hardly handle them.   ``(Abyei) has no more than a dozen or 15 permanent structures,including the military headquarters, the jail, the relief centerand the school,'' said Dodge, who returned to the capital Fridayfrom Abyei.   Neither the Americans nor others in the project have disclosedthe cost of the supply mission, but Dodge said UNICEF will pump$500,000 worth of goods into Abyei in the next six months.   The Sudanese Red Crescent says Abyei's population normally is10,000, but the refugees had swelled it to 40,000. Dodge estimated15,000 to 20,000 live there now.   UNICEF said food is so short on Abyei's open market that theprice of a 198-pound bag of sorghum, the Sudanese staple, has risenfrom $16 to $166 in two months. The refugees, most of whomabandoned all their belongings to find safety, cannot buy any.   Officials of Western relief organizations, speaking on conditionof anonymity, estimated 10,000 people perished from starvation andthe lack of medical care during the summer and continue killingabout 10 people a day in the Abyei area.   Officials estimate that twice that number in the region andfurther south receive no help because weather and road conditions,activity of the rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army or fightingbetween the rebels and the government make it impossible to reachthem.   The Liberation Army, fighting for economic and political reformssince 1983, claims to control 90 percent of the southerncountryside. A key demand is autonomy for the Christian and animistAfrican south from the Moslem-dominated government in the north.   The government earlier expelled several Western relief agenciesfor allegedly working with the rebels in order to get supplies tostranded southerners.   Relief food and medicines last reached Abyei in June, beforePrime Minister Sadek Mahdi's government halted relief operationsduring the rainy season.   Southern rebels step up their activities during the rainyseason, forcing more displaced people on the road and into camps inplaces like Abyei.   Even for those who stayed and farmed, Dodge said, record rainsflooded an area the size of Nevade and ruined their small sorghumcrops.   Mahdi's government gave the U.S. Agency for InternationalDevelopment permission to set up the Abyei relief operation afterSudanese officials visited there last week with U.S. and U.N.representatives.</TEXT></DOC>
