None is a consensus choice. The appointment is almost certain to provoke sharp comment in Congress on why President Reagan overlooked other candidates.    If Mr. Reagan decides to go outside his immediate circle of trade advisers, the choice could be Joe M. Rodgers, a well-known Republican fund-raiser who now serves as ambassador to France, his GOP supporters said. Mr. Rodgers, a former businessman from Nashville, Tenn., has an influential backer in his fellow Tennessean, White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker.    But if the president chooses to appoint a Commerce Department insider for the sake of continuity, the selection could narrow down to Clarence Brown, the deputy secretary now serving as acting secretary, or Bruce Smart, undersecretary for international trade.    The list doesn't necessarily end there. Among others being boosted by various GOP or industry groups are Charles Price, ambassador to Britain; former Rep. Ed Zschau of California; and former Sen. James Broyhill of North Carolina.    A senior White House official yesterday stressed, &quot;There are no front-runners; there is no short list. The process of selection is just beginning.&quot;    The 64-year-old Mr. Baldrige died July 25 from injuries suffered while practicing for a rodeo exhibition at a friend's ranch in California.    Rodgers's name was fed into the Washington gossip mill last week by political sponsors who wanted him to get a stride ahead of other candidates. But already, some opposition to him is building in Congress. Senate aides who favor tough trade remedies fear he would be &quot;soft&quot; on Japan, like many of the leading Tennessee Republicans.    Tennessee has amassed the largest concentration of Japanese-financed industry in the Southeast. Mr. Rodgers would have to convince the Senate, which must confirm the nominee, that he can deal with Japan as firmly as Mr. Baldrige did.    Mr. Brown, a former nine-term Republican congressman from Ohio, is senior to Mr. Smart in both rank and service, having been in the department two years longer. But Mr. Smart has the advantage of being directly in charge of trade, the subject that's likely to occupy much of the new secretary's time for the remainder of the Reagan administration.    Mr. Smart also is known to have been Mr. Baldrige's own choice for a successor if he were to retire before 1988. Both headed Connecticut-based companies at various times and were referred to as the department's &quot;Connecticut Connection.&quot; Two years ago, Mr. Smart joined the department at Mr. Baldrige's invitation shortly after leaving an executive post at a Stamford, Conn., packaging and financial services company that's now called KMI Continental Inc.    Although in a less-visible post, Mr. Brown has run the rest of the department ably and has a stronger feel for Capitol Hill. For example, when the administration originally opposed a Senate bill to convert the department's National Bureau of Standards into a more activist National Institute of Technology, Mr. Brown persuaded the Senate to modify the bill enough to make it acceptable to the White House.    Mr. Zschau, a former businessman who twice held a House seat representing California's Silicon Valley, is backed by the high-technology industry. &quot;We don't want to see our gains in export-control policy go down the drain,&quot; asserted an industry lobbyist. Mr. Baldrige adjusted that policy to meet the industry's needs, but a less forceful secretary could yield to the Pentagon's efforts to restore tough export controls. </TEXT></DOC>
