Stevens, the division chief at theU.S.andP;  Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, D.C., has worked withcomputer systems for 30 years.andM;&quot;Current LAN security is good, especially when compared to security on someIBM mainframes,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;LAN vendors learned from the mistakes ofmainframe vendors and included security features in the design of theirnetwork operating systems.&quot;andM;Stevens said that LAN operating system software has one major advantagecompared to mainframe operating systems.andP;  On a LAN, a file can be accessedonly if the originator designates it as a shared file.andP;  IBM mainframes weredesigned so all files could be shared.andP;  Suppliers were then forced to findtechniques to block unauthorized access.andM;LAN SECURITY NOT GOOD ENOUGHandM;But not everyone is satisfied with LAN security.andP;  Dennis Linnel, thepresident of Gate Technology, a consulting firm in McLean, Va., said, &quot;LANsecurity does not measure up to mainframe security.andP;  LAN security is usuallylimited to password schemes, which can be broken.&quot;andM;Customers who feel uncomfortable with these schemes can layer other securitymechanisms on top of a base LAN operating system.andM;For instance, encryption packages scramble data flowing over a LAN andprevent internal users from reading classified information.andP;  Withoutencryption, an unauthorized user with a data scope can read information as itpasses over a LAN.andP;  With encryption, the unauthorized user sees only garbledmessages.andM;Howard Davis, a software engineer at Novell Inc. in Provo, Utah, said fewcustomers require encryption.andP;  &quot;Interest in encryption is limited togovernment agencies and financial institutions,&quot; he said.andP;  For example, theBureau of Labor Statistics encrypts its data and GM does not.andM;Currently, few LAN operating systems offer an encryption option but somevendors do plan to add it to their network operating systems.andP;  For instance,Novell's Davis said that a future release of NetWare bill include encryptioncapabilities.andM;A second add-on package is a modem call-back system, which prevents hackersfrom using a corporation's dial-up lines.andP;  An employee calls up a corporatedata center and enters an ID and password.andP;  The connection is then broken anda central modem calls the employee back.andP;  A hacker cannot access the systembecause the central modem will not dial a number.andM;LAN MONITORSandM;Some users and vendors hold different views about basic LAN security but theyagree that today's LANs lack good network monitoring tools.andP;  These tools,which are often part of a security package, list which users work with whatfiles.andP;  That information is used in two ways.andM;First, large companies base chargeback systems on monitoring information.andO;For example, a word processing pool creates documents for five differentdepartments.andP;  The departments' charges are determined by the amount of timethat word processing workers are logged onto the departments' applications.andM;Second, these tools often point to possible security breaches.andP;  Once hackersknow a corporate account number and password, they use it as a springboard tobreak into other applications.andM;Network monitoring reports would display a high amount of usage with thecorrupted account.andP;  A network administrator then determines that the intruderhas entered the corporate network.andM;Analysts and vendors listed a number of reasons why LANs lack good monitoringtools.andP;  One reason is that LANs are a new phenomenon.andM;&quot;Mainframes in the early 1970s did not possess sophisticated monitoringtools,&quot; says GM's Peltier.andP;  &quot;Only after base functions were in place didvendors turn their attention to more sophisticated features, like auditingtools.andP;  I expect that the same progression will be played out in the LANmarket.&quot;andM;Also, most popular LANs are based on the MS-DOS operating system, whichcannot address a lot of internal memory.andP;  L. David Passmore, a principal withconsultancy Ernst andamp; Whinney in Fairfax, Va., termed MS-DOS limitation, &quot;RAMcram.&quot;andM;The Microsoft microcomputer operating system addresses only 640Kb ofinformation, which cannot easily support a network operating system, a userapplication and network monitoring software.andM;FEATURES, NOT SECURITY: USERSandM;Gary Wilkensen, the vice president of customer service and technical supportat Saros Corp. in Bellevue, Wash., noted that auditing was a low priorityitem for LAN vendors.andP;  &quot;They worked on other applications, like electronicmail, rather than on monitoring and security tools,&quot; he said.andM;Novell's Davis buttressed the statement saying, &quot;Our customers were moreinterested in improved networking features than in security features.andP;  Weallocated our resources according to their requests.&quot;andM;Solutions to the lack of monitoring tools are coming from a variety ofsources.andP;  Mainframe security vendors represent one market sector acutelyaware of the problem and well-positioned to address it.andM;During this past summer, Computer Associates International Inc., Garden City,N.Y., purchased the rights to Cortana, a microcomputer security product fromUnited Software Services Inc. in Vienna, Va.andM;The purchase will not immediately impact the LAN security market, accordingto Mary Welch, vice president of development at CAI.andP;  She said the companyplans to concentrate on an OS/2 version of the microcomputer security system.andM;After that products is fleshed out, she indicated that Computer Associateswill turn its attention to LAN security.andP;  &quot;Almost all of our Top Secret andACF2 customers are asking for better tools to manage their LANs,&quot; Welch said.andM;One option, which the firm had not committed to as of September, would be touse the Cortana product to fill the void.andM;A second solution would be porting the market-leading Top Secret or ACF2mainframe security tools to run on a LAN.andP;  John Blackley, an informationsenior security advisor at Capital Holding Corp. in Louisville, Ky., is anACF customer who would be interested in a LAN version of the product.andP;  &quot;Wewould like to have an ACF2-like auditing facility on our LAN,&quot; he said.andM;BOOSTING AUDIT FEATURESandM;LAN vendors are also concentrating on beefing up their products' monitoringfeatures.andP;  Microsoft's OS/2 operating system, which addresses up to 16Mb ofmemory, may solve the &quot;RAM cram&quot; problem.andP;  Vendors are beginning to takeadvantage of the extra memory.andM;Saros sells FileShare, which runs on LAN Manager and features many auditingfunctions.andP;  For example, the software automatically archives old versions ofa file and tracks 10,000 iterations of a file.andM;Saros is talking to a number of major software supplies about incorporatingFileShare as a component, according to Saros CEO Wayne Carpenter.andP;  Specificdetails are forthcoming.andM;Novell's Davis said his company plans to boost NetWare's auditingcapabilities in future releases of the software.andP;  But Davis declined tooutline which features will be added or when they would be delivered.andM;Users plan to carefully evaluate any auditing features before installingthem.andP;  Blackley from Capital Holding Corp. said, &quot;We have to see how muchoverhead a monitoring system would add to our LAN.&quot;andM;As users add more security features to their networks, the features chew upmore workstation cycles and tie up network traffic.andP;  Many companies are notwilling to trade performance for better security.andM;A second consideration is ease of use.andP;  PC users have come to exercise freereign over their desktop systems.andP;  They may fear that added security featureswill keep them, rather than intruders, from easily accessing neededinformation.andM;Network administrators must balance user's convenient access to informationagainst a company's security requirements.andP;  The task is complex.andP;  Forinstance, Pfizer installed NetWare version 2.1.5, which forces users toperiodically change their passwords.andP;  Winter, the microcomputer technicalanalyst at Pfizer, reports that some users balk at the additionalrequirement.andM;Ease of use is also a key issue for network administrators who control themonitoring tools.andP;  &quot;Many LANs are run by non-technical personnel,&quot; Novell'sDavis explained.andP;  &quot;For monitoring tools to be effective, these workers haveto be able to use them.&quot;andM;Analysts and vendors agreed that a fundamental shift in how largecorporations design applications will force companies to more closelyscrutinize their security capabilities.andM;Traditionally, important applications ran on mainframes.andP;  During the past fewyears, LANs began playing a role in these mission-critical applications,according to Ernst andamp; Whinney's Passmore.andM;In a few cases, companies designed applications that ran entirely on LANs,but, in most instances, LANs were linked to larger systems, such as an IBMmainframe.andM;During the spring IBM introduced OfficeVision, a series of software programsthat run on various IBM processors.andP;  The company included a set ofapplication program interfaces so users could build cooperative processingapplications that link LAN microcomputers to midrange systems and mainframes.andM;Most companies have just begun dabbling with these applications.andP;  As theseapplications move from test to production mode, security and auditingcapabilities will become more important.andP;  &quot;The user is no longer gainingaccess to a LAN but also to a mainframe that houses all corporate data,&quot; Passmore said.andM;Many users who have had free access to data may resist added securityfeatures.andP;  &quot;Many microcomputer users just do not understand the implicationsof LAN security,&quot; said John O'Leary, managing director of Education ResourceInc., a Plano, Texas, firm that specializes in security.andP;  &quot;Companies mustmake them aware of the dangers.&quot;andM;Some companies are trying to educate their users.andP;  GM's Peltier and Blacklyof Capital Holding Corp. spend much of their time outlining security problemsto users.andM;But the educational challenge is formidable.andP;  Many companies refuse toacknowledge security violations.andP;  Instead, they cover up breaches.andO;Consequently, few statistics outline just how many systems have beencompromised.andP;  The result--many companies are content to believe that they arenot vulnerable.andM;But some corporations know better and are actively tackling LAN securityissues.andP;  &quot;We treat our LANs just like our mainframes,&quot; said Pfizer's Winter.andO;The company backs up all files once a week.andP;  The LANs include fault-tolerantcapabilities, such as redundant file servers and backup power supplies.andM;Also, PFizer has physically secured its LAN file servers, which are housed inrooms like a mainframe glass house.andM;&quot;In New York, one cannot be too careful,&quot; Winter joked.andP;  &quot;A number ofcomputers have the unique ability to sprout legs.andP;  We don't want our mostimportant business applications walking out the front door and down thestreet one night.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
