During this time, average drilling times and well costshave been reduced approximately 45 percent through the optimization ofboth air and mud drilling practices, a streamlining of casing programs,and an increased ability to avoid downhole problems. The keys to theoptimization process have been extensive post-appraisals of offset wellsand thorough planning of each upcoming well, coupled with aggressivewellsite supervision during the drilling process. The result has beena fairly simple drilling plan with emphasis on the consistent executionof basic drilling practices.</TEXT></DOC>
