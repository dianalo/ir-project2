Stern said.   ``We've decided not to press charges. He's given us his promiseto cease and desist his pigeon activities,'' Stern said Thursday.   Domiano Parasmo, 73, of Brooklyn was taken into custody by apark enforcement patrolman on Wednesday and given a summons forviolating parks regulations that made it a crime to trap birds oranimals in the parks.   Authorities say the man caught thousands of the birds and soldthem to poultry markets.   Parasmo has been issued summonses by the American Society forthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals three times and in each case,the hearing judge dismissed the charges.   There is no law against trapping wildlife on city streets, aslong as it is done humanely; however, Park Department regulationsforbid removing or harming birds in city parks.</TEXT></DOC>
