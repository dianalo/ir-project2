<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-1035 </DOCNO><TEXT>This November marks the third time that a state-wide referendum is onthe election ballot to shutdown the Maine Yankee Nuclear power plantin Maine. The Maine Yankee facility is the principal low level radioactivewaste (LLW) generator in the state. Because of the low population density,the quantity of institutional LLW generated in Maine is quite low, lessthan 400 cubic feet/year. To date, the state of Maine has decided notto join any LLW interstate compact. To address these local issues, MaineYankee has proposed an alternative disposal concept that will make maximumutilization of the existing Maine Yankee site. Ebasco Services Incorporated(EBASCO) was commissioned by Maine Yankee Atomic Power Company to defineand examine the technical feasibility of employing a reactor containmentbuilding for LLW disposal. In this concept, all LLW generated in Maineis stored at the Plant site until the Maine Yankee reactor plant is readyfor decommissioning. While the balance of plant is decommissioned, thereactor containment building is employed as a surface vault for LLW disposal.This study surveyed the major technical feasibility issues of this concept,but it did not include a review of the institutional and economic issues.</TEXT></DOC>
