<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-21-0652 </DOCNO><TEXT>A deflector system is described that is designed to shift the phase ofelectrons with an energy of up to 20 MeV relative to a radio-frequencyfield by lengthening their trajectory with the aid of four pulse magnets.The magnetic-field switching time is 50 nsec. Use of the system in experimentson additional acceleration of electrons in a passive resonator excitedby the beam increases the energy of the phase-shifted particles by {similar_to}20%.</TEXT></DOC>
