Newmont Mining rejected an earlier offer by Poseidon GoldLtd., an Australian concern, to acquire the Newmont Australiashares it doesn't own in a stock swap valued at A$780million.</LP><TEXT>   Newmont Australia said its directors and the directors ofBHP agreed to the new proposal and recommended the stock dealto BHP shareholders.   Broken Hill Proprietary, an Australian steel, mining andoil company, holds about 55% of BHP and would hold about 23%of the merged company if the offer is accepted. NewmontMining would hold about 14% of the new company, which wouldbe renamed, according to Newmont Mining Vice Chairman RichardLeather.   &quot;The combined company will be a stronger and moreattractive company with a stronger operating group, strongermanagement and stronger prospects,&quot; said Mr. Leather.Acquiring BHP would boost Newmont Australia's 1991 goldproduction some 75% to 790,000 ounces from 450,000 ounces, hesaid. Combined, the company would have around four millionounces of gold reserves at its gold mines and another 11million ounces of resources that it might mine in the future.BHP and Newmont Australia jointly own the Telfer Gold Mine,which is expected to produce about 300,000 ounces of gold in1990.   In August, Newmont Mining sold nearly half of its shares,or 20% of the stock outstanding, of Newmont Australia toPoseidon Gold for A$166 million. At that time, Poseidonoffered to acquire the rest of Newmont Australia stock byswapping one share of Poseidon stock for every two shares ofNewmont Australia stock. Since then, both Newmont Australiaand Newmont Mining have rejected that offer.   Newmont Mining said it will continue to explore proposalsto liquidate its holdings in Newmont Australia after the BHPdeal is completed. Newmont Mining has said it is interestedin pursuing other gold prospects in Indonesia and Papua NewGuinea instead of retaining its interest in Australian goldproduction.</TEXT></DOC>
