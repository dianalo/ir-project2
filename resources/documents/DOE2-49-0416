During the study a prototypesystem called EKA was developed for the power system of the HelsinkiEnergy Board. The prototype is implemented with object-oriented techniquesand it includes a complete model of the 110-kV transmission network andknowledge for the generation and testing of switching sequences. Thestudy demonstrated that the solution method is suitable for the problem.The use of the expert system reduces routine work of the operators andgives them more time to think about the real problems. The major advantagesof the system are the easiness of the user interface and the domain-orientedrepresentation of the network.</TEXT></DOC>
