The accord, announced Monday by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, sets a cartel-wide daily output ceiling of 18.5million barrels, well under the estimated 22.5 million the cartel ispumping now.   It also resolved a key issue in the talks by giving longstandingrivals Iran and Iraq equal daily quotas of 2.64 million barrels.   While oil traders cheered the pact, they remained skeptical aboutwhether all 13 member countries of the oil cartel would adhere to it.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the January contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, traded as high as$15.80 a barrel before settling at $15.03 on Monday, up $1.06 fromWednesday's close.   The market was closed Thursday and Friday for the Thanksgivingholiday.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange Monday,the December contract for wholesale home heating oil soared 2.93cents a gallon to 48.65 cents. The December contract for unleadedgasoline settled at 46.37 cents, up 1.91 cents from Wednesday.
