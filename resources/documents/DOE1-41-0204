<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-41-0204 </DOCNO><TEXT>A photoluminescence technique to characterize, for lasing wavelength,the channeled substrate buried heterostructure wafer grown for fabricatinglasers for undersea transmission applications, is described. The techniqueconsists of photopumping a piece from the as-grown wafer at 80 K to achievelasing action and determining the lasing wavelength at 300 K after correctingfor the temperature shift of the bandgap. By comparing the opticallydetermined wavelength against the lasing wavelength measured on the device,the accuracy of the technique to predict wavelength is found to be +-20 nm. The factors that limit the accuracy are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
