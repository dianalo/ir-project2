But the vendor, fearing police might spot the transaction, shoos her away. &quot;Go to the other corner and come back after you figure it out,&quot; she says.    Such caution is more common these days. The pursuit of economic reforms in China has brought corruption, inflation and widening income gaps, and there is national concern that things are getting out of hand. The abuses -- notably the siphoning off of state goods into the private economy -- threaten to slow further reform, as conservatives in the Communist leadership seize upon them as evidence of capitalism's evils.    As a result, the authorities are cracking down. The State Council, China's supreme executive body, has issued several regulations in recent weeks aimed at controlling price increases and punishing &quot;profiteers.&quot; In August, police in Beijing joined forces with municipal inspectors to carry out sweeps of private markets, restaurants, barber shops and other establishments. The state-run media have played up criminal cases involving corruption.    This month, China began a campaign, scheduled to last four months, to catch tax evaders, which will mean more inspections and more crackdowns.    Private businessmen are feeling the brunt of the drive. During the August sweeps, more than 10,000 people in the capital were discovered to be either operating private businesses without licenses or violating China's strict residency rules, says Liu Shangyu, director of the general office of the Beijing Public Security Bureau. Most offenders were warned, but some were fined or jailed up to 15 days.    &quot;Especially in the markets, a lot of people have done illegal things. Citizens are grumbling,&quot; Mr. Liu says.    One study in his casebook concerns Song Lianfu, a retired department-store worker who was caught leasing part of his state-provided apartment to a private businessman. Mr. Song's crime was &quot;speculation,&quot; with the state charging that he made 8,000 yuan ($2,160) a year through the rental and paid only a pittance to the state in monthly rent.    The Chinese call the peddlers who try to turn quick, huge profits &quot;dao ye,&quot; or speculation lords. These people often acquire goods from state stores or factories and sell them on the free markets.    One ceramics trader, for example, gets his wares -- off the books, and therefore cheap -- from a state-run plant in a southern province. He explains how he befriends factory officials with gifts, foreign cigarettes and expensive Chinese wine. He also helps the factory carry out illegal blackmarket money transactions.    As the ceramics dealer is talking, two foreigners enter his shop. One pulls out a wad of U.S. dollars and asks to change money, but the ceramics dealer waves the pair away. &quot;They're always changing money,&quot; he says. &quot;They're Iranians. They want much too high a rate.&quot;    But there are lots of opportunities to change money. A stroll through the same market where the egg vendor and the ceramics dealer operate reveals one technique. A woman sitting in a stall makes eye contact with a foreigner and mouths the phrase &quot;change money.&quot;    At a free market in the city, a peddler in his 40s is approached by another Chinese and asked for foreign cigarettes. The peddler says he doesn't have any. &quot;There's no place I can buy these kinds of cigarettes now,&quot; he says. &quot;There's a campaign on and nobody dares to sell these things.&quot;    This entrepreneur gets his supplies of Chinese cigarettes, toilet paper, matches and soft drinks from state-run wholesalers. But to buy popular-brand cigarettes from wholesalers, he has to agree to buy unpopular brands, too -- unless something is offered under the table. &quot;If you give a little bribe to the wholesalers, they might let you buy only good brands,&quot; he says.    The big abuses involve collusion between the state and private sectors. The State Administration of Commodity Prices says that in the first half of this year, inspectors found more than 240,000 violations of price controls. Fines and confiscated illegal income together exceeded 220 million yuan ($59.4 million). The official Xinhua news agency has reported these cases:    --Three cement plants in Fujian province made three million yuan in illegal profits during the first five months of the year by selling cement on the market at higher than state prices.    --The Tangshan Iron andamp; Steel Works made illegal profits by charging different prices for buyers inside and outside its province.    --Zeng Yuanwen, a purchasing agent for a state-run tobacco company in Guangdong province, was sentenced to life imprisonment for cigarette profiteering. He conspired with two Kunming city officials, who took kickbacks for selling him cigarettes at state prices. Mr. Zeng then sold the cigarettes at higher, market prices.    Such abuses are coming at a time when for several reasons reforms are becoming harder, not easier, to carry out. Increasing economic efficiency means curbing the power of the Communist Party and tampering with the delicate relationship between party committees and factory directors. Cutting red tape means curtailing the power of bureaucrats, who strongly defend the status quo. Perhaps most important, easing China's price controls invites further inflation, threatening to roll back improvements in living standards achieved during the past several years. An indication of the problem: A nationwide price index of basic consumer goods in the first half of the year advanced 20% from a year earlier while wages rose only 10.5%.    &quot;Price reform is very complicated,&quot; says Lu Yonghua of the State Commission for Restructuring the Economic System. &quot;If you adjust too fast, the people won't tolerate it. That could cause social problems.&quot;    Chinese and Western economists say that crackdowns and administrative measures are stopgap solutions. Only an overhaul of the state's pricing system can bring lasting change, they say. But they warn that mere tinkering with the system could backfire. Pu Shan, director of the Institute of World Economics and Politics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, criticizes the go-slow approach, likening it to trying to get an entire nation to switch from driving on one side of the road to the other -- in stages. &quot;Sometimes, you have to do it all at once,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
