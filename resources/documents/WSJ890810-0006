After a five-hour special board meeting, the Chicago-based parent of United Airlines said it plans &quot;to explore all possible financial and strategic alternatives open to the company.&quot; The quick launch of the review was surprising because UAL Monday called Mr. Davis's offer &quot;an unsolicited, highly conditional proposal.&quot;    UAL said the review would include &quot;continuing its strategic business plans as an independent, publicly owned company.&quot; But such reviews often open the door to an auction-style procedure that ends in a sale. Other alternatives could include a recapitalization.    In a brief statement, Mr. Davis responded, &quot;We are encouraged by the board's response and look forward to a meeting with the company and its representatives as soon as possible.&quot;    If the UAL study does result in an auction, it could well attract many of the same bidders who pursued Northwest Airlines' parent NWA Inc., which was sold for $3.65 billion to Los Angeles investor Alfred Checchi last month.    The losing NWA bidders included the leveraged buy-out firms of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and Forstmann, Little andamp; Co. and Pan Am Corp. People who know the buy-out firms say KKR and Forstmann Little are likely to bid.    And yesterday Pan Am Chairman Thomas Plaskett said in an interview with the New York Daily News that Pan Am may consider bidding for UAL if the company is put up for sale. Pan Am, parent of Pan American World Airways, has been seeking a merger partner for several months now to buttress its domestic route network.    The board convened a special meeting at midafternoon yesterday under mounting pressure from a continuing rise in UAL's stock price, which soared $24.625 a share to $243.875 yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The latest price rise followed news that Mr. Davis's bid was $240 a share, somewhat higher than expected for an initial proposal.    In its statement, issued at 9:10 p.m. EDT, the board said it would be &quot;premature to make a decision as to whether a sale of the company to Mr. Davis or any other party at the present time would be appropriate.&quot;    UAL Chairman Stephen L. Wolf added that the board still wants &quot;to promote the long-term growth of United Airlines as a major U.S. carrier.&quot; In its deliberations, he said, the board will consider its customers, employees and the communities in which it operates as well as its stockholders.    Many observers had predicted the UAL board would either reject Mr. Davis's bid outright because of its informal nature or take more time to study the situation before responding. The speed with which it opened up a full review may have been influenced by the course of events surrounding Mr. Davis's bid for Northwest Airlines' parent NWA Inc. last spring.    Only a few weeks after rejecting Mr. Davis's bid, NWA began a review similar to UAL's after Mr. Davis took steps to oust the NWA board by launching a proxy fight and starting a procedure known as a consent solicitation. By launching a review of all of its options immediately, the UAL board could spare itself such indignities.    Since the Davis bid was first reported Monday, 5.6 million UAL shares have traded, or 26% of the 21.6 million shares outstanding. Many of the buyers have been takeover stock traders who would favor a sale. In that period, UAL's stock has risen nearly 50%.    &quot;What they're doing is playing for time,&quot; said Robert Joedicke, an airline expert at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. He said the move allows the board to &quot;keep {Mr. Davis} at arm's length while it waits to see if there is anybody else out there&quot; interested in bidding.    Kevin Murphy, an airline analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said Mr. Davis's bid of $240 a share, which Mr. Davis said he might raise after a look at UAL data, is &quot;at the low end of an acceptable bid.&quot; He estimated if the company is sold it could fetch $300 a share, or $6.75 billion.    An acquirer would have to buy 22.5 million UAL shares on a fully diluted basis, counting unexercised options.    UAL's response may also reflect Mr. Wolf's reported interest in pursuing a management-led buy-out himself. There have been reports that he would entertain a buy-out and rumors he is already pursuing such a plan. Mr. Wolf has declined to comment.    A takeover at a price of only $250 a share would give Mr. Wolf a profit of about $42 million on 250,000 stock options he holds. What's more, management usually gets about a 10% to 20% ownership stake in a company that undergoes a buy-out, giving Mr. Wolf the chance for far greater gains if the company prospers.    Separately, there were new indications yesterday that United's most influential labor group, the pilots union, would be willing to participate in a management buy-out. Previously, the union had said it wanted to make its own bid if the company became a takeover target.    Many analysts and even some pilot leaders have said they believed the pilots union wouldn't be willing to participate in a transaction led by Mr. Wolf because of the union's history of stormy relations with the UAL chairman. The pilots have been feuding with Mr. Wolf for nearly two years over terms of a new contract.    The union has said repeatedly it wants majority ownership for employees. After conferring with their advisers over the past three days, union leaders apparently believe they might be able to accomplish that goal under a management buy-out.    Whatever agreement is worked out, the union is likely to insist that employees have a large enough stake in the transaction so that they can influence major corporate decisions. Mr. Wolf would have difficulty completing a buy-out without support from the pilots and other unions.    A spokesman for the International Association of Machinists, which represents United mechanics, said that union won't support any transaction, led by management or otherwise, that doesn't protect union members' jobs and shield them from the sale of assets.    Separately, Saul Steinberg, chairman of one of UAL's largest shareholders, Reliance Group Holdings Inc., announced that Reliance Capital Group, a private leveraged buy-out fund he controls, is negotiating to sell some of its Days Inns hotels for $90 million.    Takeover stock traders are watching Reliance closely. They believe Mr. Steinberg, who became friends with Mr. Wolf when the UAL chairman engineered a turnaround of Tiger International Inc., may be advising Mr. Wolf on the situation and might participate in a UAL buy-out. </TEXT></DOC>
