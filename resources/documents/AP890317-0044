The court on Thursday also transferred several lawsuits, paid forby the National Rifle Association, to the 1st District Court ofAppeal in San Francisco.   The lawsuits contend that state law on gun registration andlicensing was intended to forbid local measures restricting gunownership.   Police and gun-control groups have long been pushing for bans onsemiautomatic rifles, particularly in cities like Los Angeles, wherethey are widely used by street gangs.   Support for local and statewide restrictions gained momentumafter Patrick Purdy entered a Stockton elementary schoolyard on Jan.17, and with rapid-fire shots from a semiautomatic AK-47 rifle,killed five children and wounded 29 other pupils and a teacherbefore taking his own life.   Since then, the cities of Los Angeles, Berkeley, Stockton and thecounty of Santa Clara have passed ordinances banning sale andpossession of the military-style weapons. It was enforcement ofthose laws the state high court refused to block.   Besides the four ordinances that were challenged in court, localbans have been passed by the cities of Gardena, Compton and Carsonand are being considered elsewhere.   The local ordinances in general forbid sale and possession ofassault weapons.   The state Legislature has voted curbs on the sale and possessionof the weapons as of next Jan. 1.   Colt Industries Inc. of Hartford, Conn., on Wednesday said it wassuspending sales to the public of its AR-15. The company said thesuspension was a voluntary reaction to the Bush administration'stemporary import ban on semiautomatics.</TEXT></DOC>
