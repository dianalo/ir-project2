I wish I'd thought ofthat.andM;I recently had the chance to talk with Hal about life in general and X-Basespecifically.andP;  Here's some of what he had to say.andP;  Please note that theopinions expressed here are Hal's, and not necessarily the opinions of FoxSoftware.andM;Hal on the  X-Base&quot; name: &quot;Who came up with that name? Xaviera Hollander?andO;There's a simple solution to this 'X-Base' problem that would make even themost red-eyed relational acolytes sit up and take notice.andP;  In Pascal andother languages you have pseudocode called  'P-code.' So why don't we call it'Pbase?' Then Pascal people would be able to point to it proudly and say,Look, it's Pseudobase,' and the rest of the world would probably not evennotice.andP;  The  X-Base' name just doesn't have the sense of quality that wouldmake me want to stake my business on it.&quot;andM;Hal on Ashton-Tate: &quot;Ashton-Tate's dBASE is at an evolutionary dead end.andP;  Idon't think A-T has added anything to the category.andP;  All the significantimprovements to DBASE have come from other companies.andP;  A-T has just given usmore of the same.andP;  I think there is a massive poverty of technology overthere.andP;  Yet they need to be watched.andP;  With the acquisition of InterBaseandlsqb;which produces client/server systems], there may be a massive infusion oftechnology that will turn things around.andP;  The signals are there.&quot;andM;Hal on Borland: &quot;I think they'll come out with an X-Base product.andP;  But Idoubt it will turn the market on its ear.&quot;andM;Hal on Fox Software:  &quot;They really have a handle on technology.andP;  I think theyhave a chance to be massive player in the industry, and I like being part ofit.andP;  These are exciting times.&quot;andM;Hal on Perrysburg, Ohio, where he spends five days out of every week:andM;&quot;What? Where?&quot;andM;Cold Snippet #2: The Sound Of One Shoe Dropping?andM;I have been 'invited&quot; to visit friendly Torrance, Calif.andP;  to meet with BillLyons of Ashton-Tate.andP;  It's been suggested that I &quot;misinterpreted&quot; thecompany's attitude in the column that appeared here last month.andM;Gulp.andM;I'll be visiting the house of the Parrot (the &quot;Ashton&quot; in Ashton-Tate was aparrot) sometime next month-just in time for my next column.andP;  So if I don'tcome back, you'll know why.andP;  David irwin is the head of irwin ink, a SanDiego, Calif.-based microcomputer marketing and communications firm.andP;  He canbe contacted at (619) 450-1960.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
