Prices of some corporate bonds were little changed in very quiet trading.    In the financial futures market, a weakening dollar helped drive prices of most interest-rate contracts lower in very light trading, traders said.    Prices of long-term Treasury bonds for March delivery declined three-eighths of a point, or $3.75 for each $1,000 face amount, to 90.03 at the Chicago Board of Trade. Eurodollars for March delivery eased 0.03 percentage point, to 93.98, at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. </TEXT></DOC>
