We try to get them todo everything they possibly can -- even if it's only to turn on a light switchwith their shoulder or chin,&quot; says Jeanett McNeely, head of Tri-Aegis, thenon-profit corporation that operates Ross House and five other intermediatecare homes in Santa Clara County.;   All of the young, intellectually alertadults of Ross House have severe cases of cerebral palsy, which has leftspeech impediments and physical disabilities. Their lives have been spent inthe homes of parents or guardians who have ministered to their every need.;  Now, Ross House is trying to wean them from that reliance.;   The facility, arenovated former private residence in San Jose's Cambrian Park area, issupported by public funds, private donations and contributions from clients'families. It opened in December as an alternative to institutional living.Ross House is the only facility in the county that takes people in wheelchairswho need long-term care.;   In addition to taking academic and specialeducation classes, and attending day programs outside, residents are taughthow to plan menus, prepare meals and shop. The program also offers a supportnetwork for families.;   &quot;Because a person can't walk or has a problemcommunicating doesn't mean that nothing is going on inside or that they haveno hopes or aspirations,&quot; said Ken Harreter, a case manager of San AndreasRegional Center, which oversees the care of the handicapped.;   Harreter saidthat, for the rest of their lives, the residents of Ross House will continueto require total care. The only other places that offer the attention theyneed are developmental centers and nursing homes. But neither is reallysuitable here -- developmental centers are too crowded, and nursing homes aredesigned largely for the terminally ill or elderly.;   Yet, after nearly ayear the people of Ross House are beginning to take comfort in theirsurroundings. Strangers for the most part, they have come to accept oneanother and share the tests of a more independent lifestyle. Like members ofany close-knit family, they fight &quot;like cats and dogs&quot; sometimes, said thefather of one resident.;   &quot;But, when it comes to the bottom line, they'resupportive of each other,&quot; he said. &quot;They have similar problems and anunderstanding for one another.&quot;;   Venturing into an unfamiliar environmentwas initially a bit unsettling for 30-year-old Lea Ventura. But she's come tofeel at home in the group-living scene.;   At first, Ventura said she worriedshe would no longer receive the same attention her parents showed her. She wasnot afraid of meeting new people, she said, but rather worried that she wouldhave trouble making the adjustment to the situation.;   &quot;We're still goingthrough a lot of growing pains, but we're getting there,&quot; said Ventura. &quot;We goat a very slow pace,&quot; she said with a smile.;   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; For moreinformation about Tri-Aegis or Ross House, call (408) 371-9433.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Bill Romano, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911006  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  627  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, October 6, 199100280058,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
