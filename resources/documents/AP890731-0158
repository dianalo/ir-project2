WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Scientist Carl Sagan urged the nation's governorsMonday to support measures that counter the environmental threatsof ozone depletion and global warming.   ``We are, to put it simply, in danger of fouling the nest,''Sagan said.   Sagan, addressing a committee on the environment of the NationalGovernors' Association, said potential damage to Earth and theenvironment is too great to delay taking steps to reduce pollutionand destruction of trees caused by global warming.   He said that if unchecked, projected increases in the Earth'stemperature due to increased levels of carbon dioxide and othergases in the atmosphere would lead to drought, creation of newdeserts, and an increase in water levels that would innundatecoastal areas.   ``It is a problem that's extremely serious and will not besolved by business as usual,'' said Sagan, an astronomy professorat Cornell University who has gained fame through his books andpublic television series.   He spoke as the the governors of New York, New Jersey andVermont released a report urging steps to combat the environmentalthreat posed by global warming.   Democrats Mario Cuomo of New York and Madeleine Kunin ofVermont, and Republican Thomas Kean of New Jersey, presented thereport to their fellow governors at the National Governors'Association annual meeting.   The report, written following a conference sponsored last Marchby the three governors, recommends a 20 percent reduction in carbondioxide emissions by the year 2000. It also recommends eliminationof chlorofluorocarbon production and use, and improvement of fueleconomy of new cars to at least 42 miles per gallon, by that date.   Kean said scientists are in agreement on steps needed to avoidthe consequences of atmospheric changes due to pollution and saidgovernors must help turn a ``scientific consensus into a politicalconsensus.''   ``We have to act now,'' said Kean. ``Otherwise we'll have themost studied environmental disaster in history.''   In addition to those steps, Sagan urged further improvements infuel efficiency, increased emphasis on alternative fuel sourcesincluding solar energy and the planting of more trees to compensatefor tree destruction taking place around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
