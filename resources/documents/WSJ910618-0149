But neither company has clear ties orstrength in Japan, said Jean-Francois Dehecq, the head ofSanofi, a unit of French oil company Societe Nationale ElfAquitaine. &quot;It's another kind of culture and it will take apartner who is of that culture,&quot; he said. &quot;We will looktogether {for a Japanese partner}, but it's still too soon.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Sanofi and Sterling, which is a unit of Eastman Kodak Co.,just received final approval from the European Community toproceed with the venture, in which the two are joining forcesin research and development and other areas.
