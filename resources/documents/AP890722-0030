The shelling came in two separate morning attacks, said PatrickVan de Velde, deputy director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation.He cited unconfirmed reports as saying seven people were woundedand four killed.   Other Western officials said pro-Vietnamese forces apparentlystaged the attacks as well as shelling Friday that killed onerefugee and wounded 10 others.   The shelling, the heaviest ever on Site 8, could be intended togain bargaining power at the peace talks to open in Paris onMonday, the officials said.   Site 8, home to about 40,000 Cambodians, is about 156 miles eastof Bangkok, separated from Cambodia by sheer rocky cliffs.   Populated mostly by women and children, it is the main civiliancamp run by the communist Khmer Rouge, the largest guerrilla groupfighting the Vietnamese-supported army in Cambodia.   In the past, the Khmer Rouge has shelled its own camps as partof its attempts to exercise strict control over the refugees.Widespread human rights violations have been reported.   Van de Velde said the refugees first sought shelter from theshelling at the base of the cliffs or along a road leading to Site8. Later, they all gathered in an open area about a mile furtherinside Thailand, he said.   ``We are sending emergency supplies to help them build temporaryshelters,'' Van de Velde said.   On Friday, a 22-year-old man was killed and 10 other refugeeswounded, including two small children, when 27 or 28 shells crashedinto the camp, a Red Cross official said.   Fighting between pro-Vietnamese forces and the Khmer Rouge hasincreased along the border in recent days, as is often the casebefore diplomatic events and peace talks.   The Khmer Rouge and the other guerrilla groups are to hold talkswith the Vietnam-installed government in Paris next week, andattend an international conference on Cambodia starting July 30.   Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1978 and toppled the Khmer Rougegovernment, which had killed hundreds of thousands of Cambodians inexecution chambers and slave labor camps after coming to power in1975.</TEXT></DOC>
