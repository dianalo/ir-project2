The legislation is Proposition 128, the CaliforniaEnvironmental Protection Act of 1990. Called &quot;Big Green&quot; bysupporters and &quot;the Hayden Initiative&quot; by detractors, thisomnibus initiative runs 39 single-spaced, typed pages ofdense legalese, sprinkled with multisyllabic chemical names.Its most radical provisions apply to pesticides and otheragricultural chemicals, and it is these sections that imperilfree trade.</LP><TEXT>   Before one can grasp the free-trade implications, however,one must get a handle on the legislation's faulty &quot;science.&quot;Rejecting the toxicologists' fundamental principle that &quot;thedose makes the poison,&quot; Prop. 128 proceeds from theunsupported assumption that a &quot;toxic&quot; is a &quot;toxic,&quot;regardless of the dose.   Prop. 128 would prohibit Californians from using anypesticides demonstrated to cause cancer or reproductive harmin tests on either humans or two different animal species,regardless of dosage. The initiative would also requiremanufacturers of &quot;high hazard&quot; pesticides -- those suspectedof being carcinogens -- to prove that these chemicals do notcause cancer. Lacking such proof, these chemicals, too, wouldbe banned.   The National Resources Defense Fund and other Prop. 128supporters adamantly maintain that the ban would applyinitially to only 19 chemicals listed as known carcinogens orreproductive toxins by the Environmental Protection Agency.This narrow reading makes for good public relations, but itdoesn't stand up to scrutiny. In fact, Prop. 128 could bantwo-thirds of the agricultural chemicals used in California.To understand why, you have to dig into the esoteric languageof the initiative -- a daunting assignment.   Prop. 128 would ban even those pesticides whose inertingredients alone fail to pass muster. The propositiondefines &quot;inert&quot; to include contaminants of inert ingredients,such as the chromium in clays used to deliver sulfur or thebenzene in oil sprays. Ironically, sulfur is a staple oforganic farming -- as well as a fungicide essential toCalifornia's $1.4 billion grape industry. And oil-basedsprays are widely used in integrated pest-managementprograms, which reduce the use of pesticides by fighting badbugs with good bugs.   Even accepting the NRDC's narrow reading, however, Prop.128 would ban such common agricultural chemicals as Captan, afungicide used on grapes, almonds and cotton -- California'sthree leading export crops. While there is no readysubstitute for Captan, other chemicals are more replaceable-- at a price. Trifluralin, used for weed control on 75% ofCalifornia's tomato crop, can be replaced with pebulate -- atan additional cost of $7 an acre, estimates Leonard P.Gianessi of Resources for the Future, a Washington-basedenvironmental research and education group. Californiafarmers are understandably opposed to Prop. 128.   But the initiative doesn't merely prohibit use of thesechemicals by California growers. It also bans the sale offood containing their residues -- including food producedoutside the state, whether foreign or domestic. Thisprovision would presumably protect California farmers fromless-regulated competition.   Prop. 128's trade provisions could move California towardthe dream of the most radical wing of the green movement:dividing the country into narrow bioregions, cut off fromtrade. The result could be empty produce shelves inCalifornia supermarkets.   Washington state apple growers, for instance, ship some 10million boxes, or 15% to 20% of their crop, to Californiaeach year. Derl Derr, president of the International AppleInstitute, says many of those apples contain trace amounts ofchemicals whose residues would be prohibited by Prop. 128.Marketing &quot;adulterated&quot; apples in California would open theapple vendor to fines of $10,000 to $25,000 per violation perday. So rather than selling their crops in California,suggests Mr. Derr, many apple growers would turn to otherstates.   Indeed, more than a fifth of all fresh fruits andvegetables brought into California in 1988 contained residuesthat would be banned under Prop. 128, reports SandraArchibald of Stanford University's Food Research Institute.This doesn't imply, however, that the residues weredangerous. Of nearly 2,300 samples of fresh tomatoes fromMexico tested over a five-year period, the Food and DrugAdministration found none that exceeded federal tolerancesfor pesticides. Some 70%, however, would be prohibited underProp. 128. More than 99% of U.S. imports of fresh tomatoescome from Mexico.   By establishing a separate trade policy for the nation'slargest state -- and one that eschews mainstream science --Prop. 128 runs directly counter to the Bush administration'strade stance. In talks on the General Agreement on Tariffsand Trade, the U.S. is pushing hard to break downagricultural trade barriers and harmonize food-safetystandards. In place of willy-nilly import regulations, U.S.negotiators propose that an arbitrator decide whether animporting country's standards are scientifically based, usingUnited Nations standards as a guide. U.N. standards are lessrestrictive than existing U.S. rules and much less stringentthan those set by Prop 128.   Even without any revisions, GATT might classify Prop. 128as a nontariff trade barrier, making the U.S. subject toretaliatory action. In response to Prop. 128, the U.S. traderepresentative asked the International Trade Commission tohold a hearing and prepare a report on the initiative'spotential impact on trade. An interim report will be releasedby the end of this month, with the final report due by Dec.31.   Initiative supporters reacted ferociously. The NRDC issueda press release calling the hearing part of &quot;a largerAdministration strategy&quot; that is &quot;intent on preventingCalifornia from enacting its own pesticide standards.&quot;Although the NRDC claimed in its testimony that Prop. 128 islegal under GATT, since it applies equally to all producers,its press release seemed to concede the issue. It said theITC report could provide ammunition to &quot;foreign importers,who could use the report as a basis to challenge Big Green asa violation of international trade regulations.&quot;   In truth, however, Prop. 128 supporters couldn't have beenterribly surprised to run into conflict with GATT. &quot;Thereseems to be a growing concern about how trade affects theenvironment, about how GATT should address those issues,&quot;says Eric Christensen, an attorney with the NRDC'sinternational program.   And environmentalists increasingly see free trade as theenemy. Green economic theorist Herman Daly, a World Bankeconomist, calls for the U.S. to abandon the free-tradesystem and impose stiff tariffs to &quot;greatly reduce theincentive to produce goods for the American market.&quot; He alsocriticizes capital mobility even within the country and urgesa sharp reduction in interstate commerce.   On a more mundane level, attorney Steven Shrybman notes inthe Naderite Multinational Monitor that liberalized tradepolicy &quot;will make it more difficult for countries to maintainor implement tough environmental standards withoutundermining the competitiveness of their domestic industry.&quot;   Mr. Shrybman, who is counsel for the CanadianEnvironmental Law Association, calls the U.S.-Canada FreeTrade Agreement &quot;a disaster, because the environment wasutterly and completely ignored. . . . We lost the ability toregulate the environment and energy development in Canada.&quot;   Just as international competition provided a powerfulcheck on the ability of organized labor to raise wages aheadof productivity, so it promises to restrain environmentalzealotry. And just as labor tried for decades to limitimports from countries not blessed with an NLRB, so theeco-protectionists campaign to save American farmers fromforeign pesticide users.   There is widespread international support for bans ondemonstrably dangerous chemicals and regulation of hazardousresidue levels. But Prop. 128 represents an Americanidiosyncrasy, the belief that everything man-made will killus. Environmentalists who oppose both trade and chemicalshave every interest in turning that conviction into a tradebarrier.   ---   Ms. Postrel is editor of Reason magazine.</TEXT></DOC>
