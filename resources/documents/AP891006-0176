A resolution denouncing Israeli rule in the West Bank and GazaStrip passed by 140 votes, with only Israel and the United Statesvoting against it. All other Western nations and Japan voted forcondemnation.   Six nations abstained: Uruguay, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,El Salvador, Zaire, Antigua and Barbuda, and Grenada.   ``Conveniently absent from the resolution is any reference tothe resort to violence by Palestinian extremists,'' said IsraeliAmbassador Johanan Bein.   Noting that at least 120 Palestinians have been killed by fellowArabs who accused them of collaborating with Israel, Bein said theresidents of the occupied territories: ``Indeed they needprotection; Palestinian citizens are being slain by PLOterrorists.''   Bein denounced the Palestine Liberation Organization forencouraging an arson campaign to set forest fires in theterritories and Israel:   ``The war by the PLO is against the land itself, and is nothingbut wild destruction.''   Farouk Khaddoumi, the PLO's foreign secretary, retorted that``Israel claims to be distressed about the trees that are beingburned, when children are being killed, and children are beingjailed by the thousands.''   The second-ranking U.S. ambassador, Alexander F. Watson,explained the negative American vote by saying ``Resolutionsincorporating one-sided and unbalanced rhetoric do not helpalleviate the conditions they purport to describe ... suchresolutions only deepen divisions, harden positions and poison theatmosphere.''   The resolution expresses ``profound shock at the continuedmeasures by Israel, the occupying power, including the killing andwounding of Palestinian civilians and the recent action ofransacking the houses of defenseless citizens in the Palestiniantown of Beit Sahour.''   Israel began tax raids on Beit Sahour on Sept. 20, and troopshave confiscated at least $500,000 worth of household goods andmachinery.   The mayor of Beit Sahour, Hanna Al-Atrash, estimated that 90percent of the town has boycotted Israeli taxes.   The General Assembly resolution ``condemns'' such practices as``the opening of fire by the Israeli army and settlers that resultin the killing and wounding of defenseless Palestinian civilians,the beating and breaking of bones, the deportation of Palestiniancivilians,'' and economic crackdowns.   Israelis have killed more than 580 Palestinians during the22-month-old uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank andGaza Strip. Palestinians have killed more than 120 suspected Arabcollaborators, and 40 Israelis have died in the uprising.   About 1.7 million Palestinians live in the Occupied Territories.   The General Assembly took up the Palestine resolution the sameday that Israel's divided inner Cabinet rejected an Egyptian peaceplan calling for talks with a Palestinian delegation in Cairo.</TEXT></DOC>
