Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BTI FGRP EUROP </CO><IN> TNM INS </IN><TEXT>   Questions raised by state insurance regulators and legislators show that B.A.T Industries PLC might face significant difficulty in obtaining approval of its $4.5 billion unsolicited tender offer for Farmers Group Inc.    Officials of the Texas State Board of Insurance have asked questions about London-based B.A.T's ability to service the debt it would incur to acquire Los Angeles-based Farmers, about B.A.T's insurance expertise and about its plans to expand in the U.S.    Scott Nance, a division manager of the Texas insurance board, said the questions &quot;potentially&quot; are serious enough to cause the board to reject B.A.T's application. &quot;It depends on how (B.A.T officials) address them and what their answers are,&quot; Mr. Nance said in an interview.    Meanwhile, in Ohio, the state House of Representatives approved, on an 84-1 vote, a resolution expressing &quot;its extreme concern&quot; about how the takeover might affect Farmers policyholders in Ohio and the company's 1,500 employees in the state.    The resolution suggested that B.A.T might withdraw capital from two Ohio-based units of Farmers or move its employees and their $27 million payroll to another state. The resolution, which passed late Thursday night before the legislature began a two-month recess, urges the state insurance department &quot;to proceed cautiously and thoroughly&quot; in evaluating B.A.T's application.    A spokesman for B.A.T, which is mostly involved in retailing and tobacco, said B.A.T is responding to the questions from the Texas insurance board and believes it meets all the legal requirements to control insurance companies in Texas and Ohio. He declined to respond to those questions in an interview, saying that B.A.T is responding directly to the insurance regulators.    Before B.A.T can buy Farmers stock under its $63-a-share tender offer, it must receive approval from insurance regulators in nine states. Such approval generally is required to purchase 10% or more of any insurance company's shares, and B.A.T's offer is conditioned upon at least 51% of Farmers shares being tendered.    Insurance regulators in several other states, including Idaho, Illinois and Kansas, have asked B.A.T to provide more information, but those requests have been largely technical. The regulators have asked B.A.T, for example, to name different parent or subsidiary companies in its application, translate its financial statements into U.S. dollars and provide audited financial statements for 1987.    Farmers, which has rejected the B.A.T offer and vowed to remain independent, is expected to oppose B.A.T's applications. However, neither the Texas questions nor the Ohio resolution was prompted by Farmers, according to the state officials involved.    Farmers shares gained $2 Friday to close at $63.625 in national over-the-counter trading. Volume was heavy, exceeding 1.7 million shares.    Wall Street traders said Farmers was rumored to be planning a board meeting Monday to take some defensive action. Farmers officials didn't return telephone calls seeking comment.    Separately, the British government early Friday cleared the way for B.A.T's offer to proceed without a British investigation of domestic fair trade and competition issues.    Mr. Nance of the Texas insurance board said that so far, B.A.T hasn't provided enough specific information about how it will service the debt that would be required to finance an acquisition of Farmers. He also noted that B.A.T has been involved in insurance for only four years, and said that statements by B.A.T that it wants to retain Farmers' current management are inadequate.    &quot;We believe that with the debt they'll incur, we need a little bit more specificity about who's going to be telling the Farmers Group present management what they want out of it,&quot; Mr. Nance said.    In Ohio, state Rep. William Batchelder, a Republican co-sponsor of the resolution that passed last week, said he believes that B.A.T will shrink Farmers, and switch some of its capital into operations that provide a greater return on equity than the insurance business. &quot;They want to get the cash that's there,&quot; Mr. Batchelder said in an interview.    B.A.T has said it wants to expand Farmers beyond the 26 states in which it currently operates, and will provide additional capital for such expansion. </TEXT></DOC>
