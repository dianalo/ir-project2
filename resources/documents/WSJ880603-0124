Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MTOR GOVMT </CO><IN> FIN BNK REL CON BON </IN><DATELINE> PHILADELPHIA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Meritor Financial Group is being pressed by federal regulators to make an accounting change that could wipe out a significant portion of its primary capital.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. wants Meritor, the parent of PSFS, one of the nation's largest thrifts, to reduce to current market value a part of its portfolio of mortgage-backed securities. Until now, Meritor has insisted on carrying the securities on its books at their original cost, $6.72 billion, rather than at their current market value, $6.33 billion as of March 31.    Meritor disclosed the dispute in a recent FDIC filing. Neither the company nor the agency would say how much of the portfolio is being challenged. If the thrift's entire portfolio of mortgage-backed securities had to be reduced to market value, Meritor's primary capital of $1.19 billion would shrink by about a third, or $397 million. But Harold Connell, Meritor's chief financial officer, said that even in the worst case, any reduction would be &quot;substantially less than the whole portfolio.&quot;    Depending on the timing of some trades, the FDIC generally views them as short-term rather than long-term investments. Thus it wants them to be recognized at current market value for regulatory accounting purposes. But Meritor is contesting the FDIC's position.    The new regulatory pressure comes at a difficult time for Meritor, which has been struggling for more than a year to resolve other serious problems. The company is still in the middle of a tortuous restructuring that began last October. It must raise more capital in the next 10 months, and volatile interest rates could thwart its goal of posting an operating profit for 1988.    Moreover, an accelerated slide in Meritor's stock price in the past two months reflects growing concern of investors that whatever the thrift does to address its capital needs might ultimately dilute the value of their holdings.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Meritor shares rose 12.5 cents to close at $4.75. The stock has fallen about 36% from its 1988 high of $7.25 a share.    The timing of the dispute is especially awkward because Meritor is considering ways to raise more equity capital. Included in its primary capital of $1.19 billion are about $252 million of subordinated notes that expire early next year. The FDIC holds $216 million of the notes, purchased in 1982 as part of Meritor's acquisition of the ailing Western Saving Fund Society. Once the notes expire, Meritor's primary capital would fall below federally required levels.    Mr. Connell acknowledged that the FDIC scrutiny of Meritor's capital base resulted from questions about how the thrift accounts for some of its mortgage-backed securities, and how it will replace the notes that expire next year. He said the thrift is working on a plan to satisfy the regulators, but declined to give details.    Industry analysts believe Meritor will have to come up with cash to make sure it continues to meet regulatory capital levels. Comments contained in the FDIC filing indicate that &quot;the regulators are focusing on the capital issue,&quot; said Diane Merdian, an analyst at Salomon Brothers.    The prospect of a stock offering that could dilute shareholder value or a debt issue that could burden the company with more costly interest payments worries investors. &quot;The FDIC doesn't care about the shareholders, it cares about the solvency&quot; of the bank, said David S. Penn, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore.    Shrinking the thrift is one of the goals of Meritor's current restructuring. Since its revamping was announced last October, Meritor reduced its assets to $18.2 billion from $19.6 billion, sold a West Coast mortgage unit for a $7 million gain, and reduced some operating expenses, mostly by cutting staff. In November, the company suspended its quarterly dividend. Some of its branches in the Washington area and the auto-financing segment of its consumer credit unit are on the block.    In 1987, Meritor had a loss of $395.8 million. It has had only two profitable quarters in the past three years. In recent talks with analysts and shareholders, Meritor Chairman Frederick S. Hammer has said that the thrift would like to show operating earnings by year end. But that goal depends on stable interest rates. &quot;If rates go up,&quot; said a company spokesman, &quot;we're not going to . . . (have) operating earnings.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
