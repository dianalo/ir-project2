Two months ago a widening trade deficit, a weakening dollar and a bond market under siege set the stage for the Oct. 19 stock market crash.    Late yesterday some of the same frightening factors were present. The government's announcement that the trade deficit hit a record $17.63 billion in October touched off an immediate plunge in the dollar and bond market. At first, stocks surprised almost everyone by seeming to shrug off the bad news, but finally buckled late in the day, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 47.08 points from Wednesday's close on futures-related selling.    But beneath the surface there are some basic differences in today's market environment from two months ago. For one thing, the crash has brought stock prices sharply lower, and few investors are worried about the market being overvalued. Further, even though interest rates are rising, the Federal Reserve Board isn't believed to be actively tightening credit as it was in the months preceding the crash.    Some changed factors can cut both ways. Trading activity is much slower now, the result of investors, particularly institutions, sitting on the sidelines. While that implies a caution that is a welcome antidote to the panic of October, it also means that price swings can be particularly volatile and responsive to even incidental developments.    Mood swings among investors also play a bigger role in a more thinly traded market. Some analysts perceived a much brighter mood among investors earlier this week, a factor that they said could help the stock market weather bad news, like yesterday's.    Nonetheless, the combination of a falling dollar and higher interest rates &quot;is very serious,&quot; said Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co. &quot;If the bond market continues under pressure and rates approach 10% again, that's going to cause some turbulence&quot; in the stock market.    The response to the trade news Thursday was swift and unequivocal in the currency markets. Traders around the world scrambled frantically to shed their dollars, sending the dollar down nearly 2% within minutes. It wound up the day in New York down 2.4% against the Japanese yen and off 1.7% against the West German mark. In early Tokyo trading Friday, the dollar continued to fall. The U.S unit was quoted at about 128.25 yen, down from 128.75 yen at the opening.    The plummeting dollar, in turn, drove interest rates to near post-crash highs. As bond prices tumbled, the yield on the government's benchmark 30-year bond climbed to 9.4%, the highest level since Oct. 21, when it stood at 9.46%.    And now many experts in both arenas are looking for worse to come. &quot;We see the long bond rising to 10% on the background of an economy that's proving resilient and a trade deficit saying the dollar's got further to fall,&quot; said David Osman, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London. He said his firm predicts the dollar will fall to 120 yen and 1.5 West German marks.    But there isn't nearly the unanimity of opinion about where the stock market is headed. The bad news on trade came just as the mood on Wall Street had begun to perceptively improve for the first time since the Oct. 19 crash. Indeed, that new mood was credited with keeping stock prices surprisingly high during much of the day yesterday.    &quot;If these figures had come out last week, this market would have been down 80 points,&quot; said Peter DePuzzo, director of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. &quot;But the psychology has changed. It's more rational than emotional.&quot;    The mood swing began last Friday after a shaky dollar and anemic retail sales had sent the stock market tumbling more than 140 points to near its post-crash lows over the course of the week. For the first three days of this week, each trading session saw stock prices climbing, volume on the New York Stock Exchange rising and rallies broadening to include more issues.    As more and more investors became convinced that there wouldn't be a return to the post-crash lows, market professionals began talking about an even broader rally by year-end.    &quot;It seemed evident last Friday that the lows would hold,&quot; said Mr. Groveman. &quot;That's a statement people hadn't been able to make since October.&quot;    Even though the mood was improving, no one was willing to bet that the stock market would take such bad news -- a worst case scenario in any investor's mind -- in stride.    And indeed, in the end, it didn't. After a quick sell-off as the market opened yesterday that most professionals attributed to European investors abandoning U.S. stocks, the market settled down to modest fluctuations up and down on light volume. Only in the last 30 minutes did stock prices drop sharply as declining futures prices triggered computerized sell programs.    Despite the late sell-off, the market's strength through much of the day impressed some traders and portfolio managers. &quot;I'm not suggesting that we have a bull market or rampant enthusiasm, but there's sure as heck a better outlook,&quot; said Thomas Ryan, a trader at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.    Others, however, said that the stock market's muted reaction to the trade figures shouldn't be seen as evidence of any strong optimism by investors.    &quot;What you're seeing is an oversold market,&quot; said Fred Lange, president of Lange Financial Services. &quot;Most of the bad news has already been discounted. Even a recession, if it started today, would be largely discounted.&quot;    And financial experts who don't participate directly in the stock market were simply puzzled by yesterday's performance. The way Irwin Kellner, chief economist of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., sees it, there were only two explanations for stock prices actually rising for a period yesterday: &quot;If the market can rise on a day like this, it's either a good sign, or it's reminiscent of the old expression that if you can keep your head while everyone around you is losing theirs, then maybe you don't understand the situation.&quot;    Foreign investors certainly didn't share any newfound optimism among their domestic counterparts. When they saw the trade figure, they promptly decided to dump U.S. stocks.    &quot;Nobody was looking for such a figure,&quot; said Claude W. Zwick, head of international securities trading for Credit Suisse in Zurich. &quot;The mood was very bearish; it was black.&quot;    And prospects of any renewed optimism among Europeans in the near term are bleak. Mr. Zwick said European investors view U.S. markets through currency-colored glasses and no one abroad is willing to believe the dollar won't fall. &quot;The dollar is everything,&quot; he said. &quot;As goes the dollar, so goes (the European appetite for) the U.S. stock market.&quot;    Meanwhile, most market professionals in the U.S. are urging caution. &quot;I wouldn't let my guard down right now,&quot; said Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. &quot;There are trading opportunities, but the fundamental factors haven't changed that much in recent days. The market is being driven by psychological factors that can't be relied on as anything more than short-term or incidental.&quot;    ---   Michael R.
