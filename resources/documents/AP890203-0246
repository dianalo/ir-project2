Economists say although the mainstay of the tax reform, a 3percent sales tax, will raise many prices in this most expensive ofnations, the overall impact of the reform on the Japanese economywill be positive.   The new laws, the first major overhaul of Japan's tax systemsince 1949, will reduce income, residential, corporate andinheritance taxes by $45 billion in fiscal 1989, which begins April1.   In line with government policy, the reform will encourageconsumption of luxury products through the elimination of a varietyof special taxes on cars, liquor, jewelry, golf equipment andelectronics.   This step is expected to inject an additional $26 billion intoJapan's robust economy in fiscal 1989.   Japan also is trying to get its people to work shorter hours.Banks that used to be open on alternate Saturdays will now be closedall Saturdays, starting with this one, under a plan to move keyinstitutions to a five-day work week.   Reflecting Japan's economic strength, the government said Fridaythat the jobless rate fell to a 6{-year low of 2.3 percent inDecember, while the surplus in the broadest measure of foreign traderose again because of booming exports.   Japan's 40-year-old tax structure no longer suited the needs ofan affluent, aging society, Shigeo Ohara, director of the FinanceMinistry's Research Division, said Friday.   The system, drafted by U.S. occupation authorities while Japanwas rebuilding after its defeat in World War II, slapped high taxeson purchases of liquor, tobacco, furs, jewelry, large appliances andother items considered to be luxury goods.   ``Now, it's hard to decide what goods are luxury items,'' Oharasaid.   Retailers will see sales increase when commodity taxes as high as23 percent are replaced by the 3 percent sales tax, says Richard C.Koo, senior economist at Nomura Research Institute.   ``Its a positive step in encouraging consumption. ...It shouldmake a big difference,'' Koo said.   The reform also is intended to help cut Japan's trade surplus andrespond to foreign criticism of taxes on high-quality liquor andother goods that boost import prices, Ohara said.   The Finance Ministry estimates the new tax laws alone, byslashing prices on luxury imports, will cut Japan's current accountsurplus by $2 billion in 1991.   Overall, the tax reform is expected to boost Japan's output ofgoods and services by about 0.2 percent.   Although consumer prices are forecast to rise 1.2 percent as aresult of a new sales tax, taxes overall will decline by $20billion, the government estimates.   However, some predict the government will quickly raise the salestax rate from the initial 3 percent, resulting in an increase intotal taxes.   The main goal of the reform, the government maintains, is todistribute the tax burden more equitably. The tax cuts favormiddle-aged salary earners through special deductions for dependentsaged 16 to 22.   ``The middle-aged salary workers felt their tax burdens wereheavy and unfair, given the high educational expenses for theirchildren,'' Ohara said.   Critics say the new sales tax is a virtual sieve of loopholesthat favors the rich while squeezing lower-income earners. Ohararesponded that while higher- and middle-income earners will benefitmost, all taxpayers will benefit from the cuts.   The new sales tax exempts small businesses, a feature that gainedthe tax's acceptance among the shopkeepers associations which hadhelped defeat earlier attempts at tax reform.</TEXT></DOC>
