The alternatives to Freon include the safe, non-pollutingFreon causing neither the break of ozone layer nor the greenhouse effectand the substances other than Freon with the functions same as or similarto Freon in some applications. Designing the chemical structure of non-pollutingFreon, a chlorine-free compound or a chlorine-contained compound thedecomposition product of which unlikely reaches from the troposphereto the ozone layer is aimed at. The most promising chlorine-free compoundis hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) 134a. The most favorite candidate of chlorine-containedcompound is hydrochlorofluorocarbon (HCFC) 123 followed by HCFC 141band HCFC 142b. (2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
