Major consumer products featuring the technologies probably won't be available until the 1990s, however, and conventional systems will remain dominant &quot;for many years to come,&quot; the company said.    Still, analysts said that Polaroid's next-generation system eventually could cost less and provide photographic quality similar to Polaroid's existing systems.    Lowering the cost of instant photography -- without lowering quality -- is important for Polaroid's growth because instant photography is about twice as expensive per picture as non-instant photography. It isn't clear yet how much a new system would lower the cost    Peter O. Kliem, senior vice president of research andengineering, said a &quot;cloverleaf intersection of technologies&quot;is establishing &quot;the foundation for a new generation ofpotential products.&quot;   The technologies, unveiled at Polaroid's annual meeting here, include high-density magnetic disks, thermal-activated film and tiny but powerful lasers that emit heat.    Polaroid, based in Cambridge, Mass., didn't describe exactly how the new technologies would work together in a system, in part because there are many options.    Analysts said, however, that the images would be captured electronically by camera on high-density magnetic disks instead of on conventional film. Photographs then would be developed on the new thermal film by using heat from semiconductor diode lasers that translate the information on the disk.    The thermal film is made possible by molecular &quot;switches&quot; that turn the correct colors on or off when a signal -- such as heat -- is applied, Polaroid said; different amounts of heat result in different colors. The new film would take the place of conventional silver-halide film -- which uses light to trigger development -- in the new system. The technology could also be used to make photographic images viewed on televisions or computer screens, analysts noted, by using imaging printers.    Polaroid still must refine these technologies before they can be used in major consumer systems. Initial high-priced commercial systems using the technologies might be available by 1990, but consumer systems will take longer. Moreover, any new system that Polaroid brings to market isn't guaranteed success because other camera companies are working on electronic imaging systems as well.    Still, analysts said that the technologies show Polaroid's plan for the future. &quot;This is very important. They have a new technology, though it will take time to commercialize it,&quot; said Brenda Lel Landry, analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. She added, &quot;As a technology, it's as important as the original instant-photography technology.&quot; James Magid, of Magid Research, said that the new system marks &quot;the beginning of a new, low-cost electronic (instant-photography) medium.&quot;    Polaroid said it is making substantial progress in developing higher-density magnetic disks. Higher-density disks are vital because one obstacle to electronic cameras has been limits on the amount of information that can be stored on existing disks. The company, which makes magnetic storage disks for computers, said it has developed 3 1/2-inch disks that can store 20 megabytes of information, 16 times the amount of information on conventional disks. The disks can't be used in computers until computer makers adopt new equipment to read the disks, equipment that Polaroid is developing.    Polaroid emphasized that it continues to work on improving its silver-halide film technology. It said that recent research has resulted in &quot;experimental film&quot; with a sharper image than existing film. Analysts said new film using the technology could be available next year, and could improve the appeal of Polaroid's popular Spectra camera, introduced last year.    Separately, the company said that it has increased its goal for return on equity to 15%. Its previous goal had been 10%, and it posted a 10.8% return on equity in 1986. It also said its capital spending will increase to $110 million this year from $82.9 million last year.    At the meeting, shareholders approved an increase in the number of authorized common shares to 150 million from 60 million. There were about 31 million common shares outstanding on March 13, and the company will distribute a previously announced 2-for-1 stock split on June 27 to stock of record May 22.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Polaroid closed at $77.125, up 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
