President Reagan signed without comment Friday a measure that will raise $4.1 billion over three years and extend some popular tax breaks. The bill, which was the product of much battling in Congress, was acceptable to the Reagan administration largely because it would pay for sought-after extensions of expiring tax breaks and for technical corrections to the 1986 tax-overhaul law.    But when the new Congress convenes next year, the administration of George Bush will be faced with demands for quick action to reduce the budget deficit. He has said he can do that without a tax boost, and indeed has promised not to raise taxes. But skepticism on this issue is widespread, especially among the Democrats, who slightly increased their control of Congress in the same election that put Mr. Bush in the White House.    The tax bill signed by President Reagan hits defense contractors, under fire for the procurement scandal, while it helps authors, farmers and mutual fund shareholders. A &quot;taxpayer bill of rights&quot; provision is aimed at beefing up taxpayers' rights in disagreements with the Internal Revenue Service.    The bill also removes the limit on the amount of long-term bonds the Treasury can issue, a provision sought by the administration in order to finance the national debt.    The bill raises taxes by accelerating corporate estimated tax payments, curbing life insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters, and restricting the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations. It places a temporary 15% excise tax on a company's withdrawals of excess pension assets, in order to discourage the use of those assets by the company or a concern that wishes to acquire it.    Defense companies and other long-term contractors fought unsuccessfully against the bill's most controversial provision, which will raise $1.3 billion from them over three years. This provision changes the tax-deferral technique known as the completed contract method of accounting, which allowed contractors to delay paying part of their taxes on income from a contract until the contract was completed.    Under the new law, long-term contractors will be able to defer only 10% of their taxes on income from a contract, rather than the 30% previously allowed. Contracts for residential housing are exempt.    Pipe smokers will pay a new 45-cents-a-pound tax on pipe tobacco under the bill, and individuals who use their homes as their offices will get less of a tax break. Deducting the base cost of a telephone that is also used for personal purposes will no longer be allowed.    But some tax breaks were extended, including an exemption to the 1986 tax law that would have required mutual funds to report expenses as income to holders. The one-year exemption for 1987 was extended through 1989. Authors, artists and some livestock producers also were exempted from a rule barring them from deducting certain expenses before a project produces income.    While White House officials had signaled for weeks that President Reagan would sign the tax bill, rumors that he might not created fluctuations in some markets. While the measure was approved by Congress in late October, it was time-consuming to enroll all of its complex provisions in the elaborate form used for the final version of legislation, and additional time was needed for administration officials to review them, White House officials said.    Tax benefits in the bill include:   --Extending through 1989 the 20% research and development tax credit that is scheduled to expire at year end.    --Extending tax breaks for thrifts that rescue troubled thrifts through the first half of 1989. It also would provide the same tax incentive to healthy banks that take over troubled banks.    --Extending a tax break for employer-provided education expenses through the end of this year.    --Extending a provision that eases the tax treatment of research and development expenses that support foreign operations, effective for four months.    --Extending a credit given to employers who hire economically disadvantaged workers through 1989.    --Keeping farmers from having to pay the diesel-fuel highway tax for fuel used off the road.    --Liberalizing the tax credit for low-income housing.    --Allowing families to avoid tax on interest earned on U.S. savings bonds redeemed to pay for college or vocational education.    --Allowing farmers who are forced by drought to sell livestock to delay tax on that income for a year. It also would allow farmers who received drought-assistance payments to defer income tax on them for one year.    --Preventing recognition of taxable gain on the sale of a personal residence for anyone 55 or older if the house had to be sold because the person has become incapacitated. </TEXT></DOC>
