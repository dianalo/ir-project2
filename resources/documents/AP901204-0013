What have you got? Well, just add insecticide, a plastic cap anda lime-green coating and you come out with what researchers call alethal new weapon in agriculture's long-running war against theboll weevil.   It may not look like much, but developers say their newbroomhandle bait stick will deliver a lopsided kill ratio in thefight against the hated arch-enemy of America's cotton producers.   ``It's a simple concept, really, but represents putting togetherfindings from 30 years of research on boll weevil behavior,'' saysUSDA research scientist Gerald H. McKibben.   In Mississippi fields where the device is being tested for thesecond year, scientists are finding 70 percent fewer weevils, hesays.   And one of the glories being claimed is that the homely lookingimplement uses just one gram of insecticide an acre, 100 times lessthan usual. Backers say it could gain support from consumerists whowince at hosing down farm fields with chemicals in the fightagainst insects and other pests.   ``It's possible that the bait stick idea could be used for otherinsect pests on other crops in the future,'' McKibben says. ``Butwe have to test that further.''   McKibben developed the stick at the Agricultural ResearchService Boll Weevil Laboratory in Starkville, Miss. Testing is alsoin progress in Texas.   McKibben says his agency has signed contracts with two privatefirms to improve the device for commercial use.   It is made by thrusting the broomstick through the center of afoil-like aluminum pie pan and driving one end of the stick intothe ground. The pan, with its interior facing up, rides halfway upthe stick.   The stick is topped with a lime-green plastic cap covered withinsecticide, a feeding stimulant and a chemical called grandlure.   Scientists say grandlure is highly effective as a sex attractantfor weevils. And for some reason lime green seems to be theirfavorite color. But when the critters pay a visit to the cap theyget a nasty dose of insecticide and fall dead into the pan.   Since the insecticide is on the cap, it stays out of the soiland ground water.    lime-green compound that kills weevils has also been paintedon the side of the stick. A patent has been filed for both thecoating and the cap.   Before he was through last year, McKibben was finding 200 to 300dead weevils a day in his pans, agriculture officials say.   ---   WASHINGTON (AP) - Agriculture Department forecasters say finalfigures will show strong vegetable production in 1990, exceedingthe trend of the last decade and a half for the second straightyear.   Processing tomato and fresh onion crops appear destined to setproduction records while the dry edible bean crop is likely to comein just short of a record, according to latest figures from USDA'sEconomic Research Service.   Fall potato and sweet potato output also are on their way toposting increases, forecasters say. They say increases in thesecrops account for the bulk of the gain in overall vegetableproduction over last year's level.   Farmers expanded acreage planted in potatoes this year and thusboosted the crop 6 percent over last year's level of 370.4 millionhundredweight.   Dry edible bean production should end the year at 32 millionhundredweight, 33 percent above the 1990 level but 1 percent below1981.   Vegetable growers were hammered by a hard freeze early in the1990 season. It was especially tough on Florida's tomato crop.Growers replanted, though, and by spring ideal conditions werehurrying an unusually abundant crop to market. That sent pricesdown, at times below the costs of picking and packing, and therewere reports of tomatoes left in fields.   The outlook for next season is for stronger supplies and pricesgenerally below a year earlier for the crops.   ---   WASHINGTON (AP) - Supermarkets continue to have the largestshare of the nation's retail food sales, new Agriculture Departmentfigures show.   Supermarkets constitute only about 10 percent of the storesselling food around the country but have 70 percent of the sales,said a report from USDA's Economic Research Service.   The reason for the dominance of supermarkets is that they dealin high volume, the report says. It also says supermarkets areunlikely to remain unchanged as consumer trends already evidentintensify.   Forecasters say the supermarket will become provide anincreasing number of goods and services to meet consumer demand forspeed and convenience and soon may be serving dinner right at thestore.</TEXT></DOC>
