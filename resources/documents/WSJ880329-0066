In an interview yesterday, he said he expects to introduce &quot;quite soon&quot; legislation to implement the pact. &quot;I'm going to pass it, I'm going to run on it and I'm going to win,&quot; he said. Mr. Mulroney must call an election by September 1989 but implied he'll do so much sooner.    He said signs are &quot;quite positive&quot; that Congress also will approve the bilateral trade agreement. The pact gradually would abolish all tariffs between the two nations and remove many other trade barriers. Mr. Mulroney said the agreement will send a &quot;powerful signal to liberalize trade around the world.&quot;    The Canadian prime minister, a close ally of President Reagan's, said that protectionist sentiment in the U.S., once so &quot;lethal and attractive,&quot; has been &quot;wrestled to the ground&quot; over the past 18 months. He expressed confidence that the omnibus trade bill being hammered out in a House-Senate conference committee won't be the protectionist document so many international leaders had feared.    Mr. Mulroney said the change of sentiment in the U.S. is due to the power of intellectual arguments against protectionism and to the common sense of Americans. He cited the defeat of protectionist candidates in the recent presidential primary in South Carolina, whose textile industry once actively sought protection, as evidence of the change in America. Yesterday, Rep. Richard Gephardt (D., Mo.), who had campaigned hard for a stronger U.S. stance against what he called unfair trading partners, withdrew from the presidential race, a further piece of evidence.    Mr. Mulroney was in New York to receive an award from the Pan American Society, which promotes hemispheric cooperation. In remarks prepared for the event, Mr. Mulroney expressed unhappiness over the U.S. failure to impose tougher controls on air pollutants that Canada claims are the cause of &quot;acid rain.&quot;    &quot;Nothing less than targeted, mandated reductions in acid-rain emissions in the U.S.&quot; will satisfy Canada, Mr. Mulroney said in his prepared remarks. The Reagan administration argues that the cause of acid rain requires more study. Mr. Mulroney said in the interview that even &quot;a seven-year-old knows&quot; that it is caused by air pollution. Canada blames half its acid rain on wind-carried pollution from power plants in the U.S. Midwest.    Mr. Mulroney is to visit President Reagan April 27 for the last of the annual summit meetings the two leaders have held since Mr. Mulroney took office in 1984. He said acid rain will be the main issue that he wants to discuss.    Mr. Mulroney said high U.S. and European subsidies for grain exports are &quot;the biggest problem&quot; that Canada plans to raise in June when the prime minister plays host in Toronto to the annual economic summit conference of the Group of Seven industrialized nations. He said that the &quot;agricultural war between the two richest groups in the world&quot; was harming Third World exporters as well as Canada, and that it was &quot;nuts&quot; for the U.S. to subsidize the Soviet Union's grain purchases.    The U.S. has proposed that agricultural subsidies be phased out by the year 2000, but Mr. Mulroney said Canada will argue for a more &quot;compressed&quot; timetable.    Mr. Mulroney predicted that Canada's two opposition parties would lose votes in the next election because they are opposed to the free-trade pact with the U.S. He deplored Liberal Party leader John Turner's threat to tear up the trade pact if his party wins the election. &quot;This is for juvenile delinquents,&quot; Mr. Mulroney said. </TEXT></DOC>
