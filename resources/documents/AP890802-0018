Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, aides said, will kick off thecampaign with a series of speeches outlining the risks to America'sglobal competitive position from low savings rates, which drive upthe cost of capital for U.S. businesses.   The personal savings rate, savings as a percent of after-taxincome, fell to a 40-year low of 3.2 percent in 1987 and increasedonly slightly to 4.2 percent last year.   By contrast, the savings rate in Japan was 16.5 percent in 1987.   The administration is looking at a variety of possible solutionsto the problem, ranging from broadening the tax savings offered byIndividual Retirement Accounts to eliminating the double taxationon corporate dividends.   The trouble is that such proposals to offer tax breaks to peoplewho save would mean a tax loss of billions of dollars when thefederal government is already straining to reduce huge budgetdeficits.   But officials said it was likely that the administration wouldoffer some changes in U.S. tax law for Congress to consider.   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, testifying Tuesdaybefore the Senate Banking Committee, called boosting the low U.S.savings rate ``the crucial issue for the long-term economic outlookof the country.''   Economists have long warned that the low personal savings rates,combined with the large federal budget deficits, were driving upinterest rates in the United States and making it more expensivefor U.S. businesses to borrow money needed to expand and modernize.   Greenspan, as he has done in the past, urged Congress to makereducing the federal budget deficit a top priority. But he saidlawmakers should also consider ways to boost personal savings toexpand the pool of available capital.   The Fed chairman noted that between the Civil War and World WarI, America had the highest savings rate in the world, which helpedsupply the capital needed to transform the country into anindustrial giant.   While the personal savings rate had rebounded somewhat to 5.5percent during the first six months of this year, Greenspan saidmore must be done to push the rate higher.   Greenspan said officials at the Federal Reserve, the TreasuryDepartment and the president's Council of Economic Advisers werestudying a variety of legislative proposals to boost savings,including the possibility of making changes in financial marketsthat would favor savers.   Treasury Undersecretary Robert R. Glauber said in an interviewthat the administration had a task force reviewing the savingsissue and that one option being considered was revamping IRAaccounts, which were scaled back in the 1986 tax law.   Also being studied, Glauber said, are ways to eliminate the taxcode inequity that makes it cheaper for corporations to borrow tofinance expansions than to issue stock.   If a corporation raises capital by borrowing, it can deduct itsinterest payments. But if it sells stock and distributes dividendson its profits, both it and the shareholders are taxed on thoseprofits.   Glauber said Brady would frame the issue in a series of speechesthis fall as part of an overall need in America to focus more onlong-term goals. He said the administration's push for a reductionin the capital gains rate would be included as one of the changesneeded to lower the cost of capital to businesses.   ``These are issues on which the secretary feels very strongly,''Glauber said. ``He is going to map out an agenda in some detail andwith some coherence.''   In a preview of the initiative two weeks ago, White House BudgetDirector Richard Darman called in a speech for both public andprivate belt-tightening to cut budget deficits, increaseproductivity, improve the education system and make other necessarysacrifices to ``adequately address the future.''</TEXT></DOC>
