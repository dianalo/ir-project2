State employees thinkhe's robbing their pensions, welfare recipients think he'spushing them deeper into despair. Taxpayers are being told tocome up with an additional $7 billion in response to thebiggest state tax increase in U.S. history. Even youngsterswho buy a bag of cheese doodles are paying taxes on them forthe first time.   At the middle of all this anger and angst is a whisperyman named Pete Wilson, who for months sat at a long woodentable in the state capitol as the budget deficit tumbled outof control, finally exceeding $14 billion. Then he embracedtaxes he didn't like and, just as astonishing, embracedDemocratic lawmakers he liked even less.</LP><TEXT>   GOP Assemblyman Tom McClintock of Ventura County, who twoyears ago circulated a petition urging then U.S. Sen. Wilsonto run for governor, now charges that the governor&quot;completely misrepresented himself to the voters&quot; andpredicts he will be &quot;the Herbert Hoover of Californiapolitics.&quot; Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a fiery Democraticpopulist from San Francisco who helped the governor cobbletogether the budget compromise, contends that every positionMr. Wilson has taken in his eight months as governor &quot;isrooted in politics and his own ambitions to be president.&quot;   Yet Democratic Assembly Ways and Means Chairman JohnVasconcellos thinks that the governor, by positioning himselfas an aggressive moderate who is giving everyone room formaneuver but the hard right and the hard left, has the rightidea. If that's so, Mr. Wilson may emerge as a model forgovernors across the country. The policies that are tried inSacramento have a way of turning up in Bismarck, Little Rock,Lansing and Montpelier before long.   &quot;He's running the state with the largest budget and thebiggest decisions, with problems beyond comprehension, and hemight have figured out a way to get things going,&quot; says ThadBeyle, a University of North Carolina expert on stategovernors. &quot;He could be the prototype of the governor of the1990s.&quot;   The passions being generated by Pete Wilson, who callshimself a conservative but who consorts with Democrats, mayseem outsized. But then so, too, is everything else aboutCalifornia, a state that has tomorrow's problems today.   With a population bigger than Canada's, a giant indefense, energy, agriculture, education, tourism andtransportation, California is a nation-state in its ownright, with an economy bigger than those of all but sevennations in the world. It leads the U.S. in televisionstations, farm revenue, cars and rush-hour traffic. Itaccounts for almost a third of all Pentagonresearch-and-development spending. It is growing so fast it'sadding a population the size of San Francisco each year.   It also has enormous challenges, so great that Mr.Wilson's friends cautioned him against leaving his cozysinecure in the Senate and taking on a state that is all butungovernable. A third of California high-school studentsdon't graduate. Some schools have student bodies with 40different native languages. Both school enrollments and thestate's population over age 65 have grown by more than 20%since 1984 -- and the prison population has quadrupled in thepast decade. About half the adults living in poverty have nohealth insurance.   Into this maelstrom stepped Mr. Wilson, a former mayor ofSan Diego with only a modest Senate record but with oneimportant attribute: As governor of the nation's colossus, heinstantly becomes a political colossus in his own right. Withthe new population shifts taken into account, Californiaprovides 20% of the electoral votes a candidate needs to winthe presidency. And no other political figure in America hasbeen a state legislator, a big-city mayor, a U.S. Senator anda governor.   Already the new magus of Sacramento is reaching out beyondCalifornia. During his bruising budget battle, Gov. Wilsonpointedly called other Republican governors, even discussingthe intricacies of workers' compensation with Gov. JohnMcKernan of Maine. Last month, while attending the NationalGovernors Association meeting in Seattle, he quietlyorganized his own private dinner party for a handful of GOPgovernors.   But first Mr. Wilson, 58 years old, has to survive therigors of California's state capital -- &quot;a pretty rough brandof politics,&quot; says GOP Assemblywoman Bev Hansen, &quot;a lotharder than the gentlemanly ways of the Senate.&quot;   Mr. Wilson's strategy is to defy the easy stereotypes andto govern creatively if not always ideologically or evenconsistently. &quot;His judgments are no different than judgmentsthat a liberal Democrat would make,&quot; says Democratic Gov.Mario Cuomo of New York. &quot;Seven billion dollars in taxes? Andhe's a conservative?&quot;   Cut adrift from his own party -- Republicans reluctantlyprovided only nine of the 54 votes the budget compromiseneeded in the Assembly -- Mr. Wilson will succeed with hisgrand political bargain only if the budget agreement works.&quot;He'd better produce results,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a SanFrancisco-based Democratic pollster. &quot;Right now this is astate in a bad mood, and if this doesn't work, he'll be partof the `mess in Sacramento,' and he'll never be able to gonational.&quot;   The budget provided Mr. Wilson with as big a test asanyone in politics ever gets. The $14 billion deficit wasabout a third of the state's general operating fund -- so bigthat, as Mr. Wilson said earlier this year, it couldn't beclosed even if all the state universities and prisons wereclosed and the entire state work force were let go.   In the end the gap was filled with $7 billion of new taxes(including income-tax increases for those making over$100,000 a year), $5 billion in spending cuts and $2 billionin accounting shifts and fund transfers -- a combination sounappealing that, once it was completed, the Los AngelesTimes described it in an editorial as &quot;the budget thateveryone still hates.&quot; The tax increases alone were theequivalent of $243 for every man, woman and child in thestate.   Mr. Wilson's first step was to make Democratic lawmakers,frozen out for eight years under former GOP Gov. GeorgeDeukmejian, part of the solution rather than to portray themas part of the problem. &quot;I had no relationship with theprevious governor,&quot; says Mr. Vasconcellos, who had been Waysand Means chairman for 12 years. &quot;He wouldn't talk with mefor seven years and bragged about it. With this governor, I'ma partner.&quot;   That made all the difference with the Democrats, whocontrol the state Legislature. &quot;Sacramento was like a cityfull of abused children locked in a closet,&quot; says KathleenBrown, the Democrat who serves as state treasurer, &quot;and herewas someone who invited them into the front room.&quot;   But Mr. Wilson also alienated the Republican leadershipand an important coalition of conservatives, particularlyantagonizing them when he said that Republicans who wouldn'tvote for tax increases would be &quot;{expletive} irrelevant.&quot;They were aggravated when he pointed out, repeatedly, thatRonald Reagan raised taxes as governor and didn't suffer inhis career.   &quot;To me a Republican believes in the free market, in lessgovernment, and allows individuals to achieve their ownpotential,&quot; says Assemblyman McClintock. &quot;Pete Wilson doesnot meet that definition in the slightest. He's adopted theDemocratic agenda.&quot;   Gov. Wilson's reply to complaints he betrayedconservatives: &quot;That was the price I had to pay. . . .Opposing taxes became a theology for them, and they pledgedon their mothers' sacred honor that they never would supporttaxes. There was no way to get them.&quot;   The governor, who has a cool, managerial air, surprisedsome of the lairds of Sacramento by his cunning firmness andhis displays of sheer political force. He toppled AssemblyRepublican minority leader Ross Johnson this summer when theOrange County lawmaker resisted tax increases. DisaffectedRepublicans believe he won votes for the budget package by aseries of back-room deals: promising help in redistricting toone legislator who wants to win a congressional seat, forexample, and promising fund-raising help for a deeplyindebted assemblyman.   He worked the vulnerable Republicans one by one. &quot;Some ofmy colleagues think being invited into the governor's officefor a Coke and a peanut-butter cookie is too irresistible,&quot;says Mr. Johnson, the deposed GOP leader.   Then Mr. Wilson arranged a complicated plan so that thefew Republicans he snared could rotate in voting for the taxelements of the package. As a result, most of the GOPlawmakers who assisted him won some political cover becausethey escaped voting for all the taxes.   The budget overhauled welfare, cutting checks by about $31a month for a family of three, but liberalized limits onearnings. It transferred about $2 billion of programs fromthe state to local authorities, suspended automaticcost-of-living increases for entitlement programs andtightened workers' compensation.   In all, the budget that emerged was a model of balance andpolitical acuity. The cuts were made across the board, so nointerest group could come forward and plead special harm. Thetaxes included two new brackets for the wealthy, helping thegovernor avoid a &quot;tax-the-rich&quot; ballot fight next Novemberthat would have kept the tax issue alive and complicatedRepublican campaign efforts at a time when two U.S. Senateseats are at stake. He also managed to avoid a utility taxand an increase in the bank and corporation tax.   &quot;He guided the legislature in a way to guard the businessclimate and to avoid putting additional burdens on business,&quot;says Laurence McCarthy, president of the California TaxpayersAssociation, a business-oriented study group.   The governor, moreover, agreed to a level of taxes thatwas high enough that it became difficult to complain that thespending cuts were punitive. &quot;Given the magnitude of thetaxes, it was hard to say there's too many cuts and notenough revenue,&quot; says Leonard Goldberg, a Sacramento lobbyistand consultant.   Spending still rose 7%, enabling conservatives to mock thegovernor's 1990 campaign statement that his Democratic rival,former San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, was &quot;a taxer anda spender and I am not.&quot; And the governor was able toundertake new spending initiatives, primarily a newteen-pregnancy prevention program and a child-care planpatterned on the federal Head Start program. The budget alsoincludes $7 million to replace federal funding forfamily-planning providers who choose not to adhere to fundingrequirements that prohibit the discussion of abortion.   The budget won good reviews from political analysts. &quot;Aspublic budgets and state governments go, it's hard to see howthey could come up with a better effort,&quot; says JeffreyChapman, an economist who heads the Sacramento Center of theUniversity of Southern California. &quot;The astonishing -- veryastonishing -- thing is that they were able to come up withthis and then get it through a legislative body.&quot;   But for all the encomiums, and despite Mr. Wilson's boastthat the budget sets the state &quot;free to set a new course forCalifornia,&quot; the governor emerges from his first test as moreof a skilled repairman than a visionary architect. There islittle structural reform, and the budget has its share ofphantom savings and illusory revenue-accounting techniquesthat, in the end, probably won't amount to much.   The budget, for example, calls for $300 million in&quot;increased federal recoveries&quot; that are unlikely to berealized. The state is unlikely to achieve some $1.2 billionof across-the-board cuts because of the time required to cutpersonnel and because of the growing state workload stemmingfrom California's rising population. The budget also assumesthat the recession will end about now, but the nonpartisanLegislative Analyst's office, in reporting July's revenue,noted &quot;continued softness in the state's economy.&quot;   Nor has Mr. Wilson navigated all of his politicalobstacles. He knows he can't wrest anything out of thelegislature without dealing with Speaker Brown or DavidRoberti, the senate president pro tempore. This month he mustmake the politically sensitive decision of whether to heedconservative demands that he veto legislation prohibitingdiscrimination based on sexual orientation.   The twin Senate races of November 1992, moreover, may be abigger test than anything the legislature throws at him. Thegovernor has indicated he won't sit out those primaries, sohe'll have to make difficult choices, potentially alienatingconservatives yet again.   At the same time, Christian fundamentalists have quietlytaken control of a number of county Republican centralcommittees, and the governor will have to confront them.&quot;Wilson makes deals, but they don't,&quot; says Larry Berg, apolitical scientist at the University of Southern California.&quot;They'd rather go down in flaming glory and be right than tomove an inch and perhaps succeed.&quot;   But the governor has shown some willingness to improvise.To handle the drought, now in its fifth year, Mr. Wilsoncreated California's first price and market system for thestate's most precious resource. The state's water bank,formed primarily from farmers willing to sell their water,made water available to others willing to buy it, includingurban areas and other farmers who needed it to keep theirfruit trees alive.   Perhaps because he's offended so many, Mr. Wilson isalready receiving national attention, even among Democrats,for his efforts. &quot;Wilson is saying there are real problems,he's telling the truth about them and he's attacking themhead on,&quot; says Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, chairman of theDemocratic Governors Association. &quot;There's a real market forthat.&quot;   These days Mr. Wilson works in the capitol's Cabinet Room,sitting beneath a plaque noting, suggestively, that RonaldReagan was &quot;the first California governor elected presidentof the U.S.&quot; But the governor says he's not thinking aboutrunning for president himself and talks about running for asecond term in 1994. &quot;I've got,&quot; he says, &quot;the job I'vealways wanted.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
