Graham Claytor Jr., Amtrak's chairman andpresident. &quot;Unsatisfactory,&quot; he grumps to a train attendant.&quot;It has to be fixed.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Stern and demanding, Mr. Claytor has worried Amtrak, nitby nit, into the best shape of its 19-year history. Now, heis promising that Amtrak will do by the year 2000 what hardlyany other passenger rail system in the world does: operatewithout taxpayer subsidies. Success would mark the &quot;upset ofthe century in passenger railroading,&quot; says William Withuhn,a rail historian at the Smithsonian Institution.   Despite the odds, some employees and academics expect Mr.Claytor to succeed. Eight years ago, government subsidiescovered 52% of Amtrak's operating costs. Now, the subsidieshave dropped to $604 million (from $896 million in 1981) andcover only 28% of those costs. &quot;If I were a betting man, I'dput money on him,&quot; Mr. Withuhn says.   Mr. Claytor's progress has surprised many skeptics. Calledfrom retirement in 1982 to head the nation's passengerrailroad, the former Southern Railway president and Navysecretary has fought sloppy service, has increased revenueand has controlled costs. His steady financial progress haswon him allies in Congress and derailed federal budgetcutters.   &quot;We were asking if Amtrak was a bottomless pit and did weneed it,&quot; recalls Rep. William Lehman, a Florida Democrat andthe chairman of the House transportation appropriationssubcommittee. &quot;Now we're saying let's modernize it.&quot;   But the tracks are littered with obstacles. Most immediateis the Bush administration's hope to end Amtrak's subsidiesin fiscal 1991 -- far earlier than Mr. Claytor would like.Although Congress isn't likely to approve such a cutoff, Mr.Claytor still must find capital funds. He needs, over thenext 10 years, $1.5 billion to $2 billion to expand Amtrak'sskeletal network so that it can generate the revenue to runon its own.   Mr. Claytor also faces problems of low levels of serviceand, because of lagging capital outlays, overworkedequipment. Except for the Boston-to-Washington NortheastCorridor and a few other busy lines, service on most ofAmtrak's 24,000 miles of routes consists of one train a day.At Chicago's Union Station, John Skinner, an Amtrak assistantsuperintendent, tells subordinates that the oil-splattereddiesel locomotive on a train ready to depart looks like a&quot;piece of junk.&quot;   Partly to make up for any reductions in federal operatingsubsidies, Mr. Claytor wants legislation to relieve Amtrak of$135 million a year in employee retirement costs that hebelieves should be borne by freight railroads or the federalgovernment. He also is trying to persuade the Urban MassTransportation Administration to pick up more of the coststhat Amtrak incurs because commuter railroads heavily use theNortheast Corridor.   Moreover, Mr. Claytor is lobbying in Congress to get -- ifthe federal gasoline tax is raised -- a penny a gallon of itassigned to Amtrak's capital needs. Meanwhile, he lined up$105 million in private financing for 104 new passenger carslast year.   And he is coaxing states and communities along Amtrakroutes to pay for modernizing stations, adding trains andimproving track. But when he refused to commit additionalfunds to the busy line between San Diego and Los Angeles lastDecember, he got an angry reaction. &quot;He never takes anyinitiative to improve the service&quot; on that line, says JamesMills, a former Amtrak chairman who heads the Los Angeles-SanDiego Rail Corridor Agency.   &quot;We're not a philanthropic organization,&quot; Mr. Claytorreplies. &quot;If we did everything everybody wanted, we'd gobroke.&quot;   In addition to finding new money, Mr. Claytor's plandepends on wringing more costs out of rail labor, which hasalready agreed to new work rules to help Amtrak. The changes,Amtrak acknowledges, were worth about $50 million a year -- asignificant sum, perhaps, but minor compared with Amtrak'sfiscal 1989 salaries and benefits of $1.03 billion.   Shortly after arriving at Amtrak, Mr. Claytor tookadvantage of 1983 legislation and hired his own crews to runthe Northeast Corridor trains. He paid them a week's wagesfor 40 hours worked. Previously, the trains were operatedunder contract with Consolidated Rail Corp., whose crews gota day's wages for each 100 miles traveled. By operating oneof Amtrak's speedy Metroliners round trip between New Yorkand Washington -- less than eight hours' work -- they earned4 1/2 days' pay.   &quot;Everything I worked for has been taken away,&quot; complainsJohn Harrison, an engineer from Elkton, Md. He now works 20days a month, twice as many as before. Joseph J. Carella,another engineer, says, &quot;I was making about $1,000 a weekseven or eight years ago working three days a week. I'm nowmaking about $1,000 a week working five days.&quot;   Later, Mr. Claytor negotiated the right to hire his owncrews nationwide.   &quot;We're damned frustrated with Amtrak,&quot; says RichardKilroy, head of the Railway Labor Executives' Association,which represents rail unions. &quot;It is demanding cutbacks . . .when we have been the main ingredient in their success.&quot;   When Mr. Claytor took over at Amtrak, his crusty bluntnessand keen eye for railroad operating details amazed somestaffers accustomed to the collegial style of hispredecessor, Alan Boyd. &quot;Details bore me,&quot; Mr. Boyd says.&quot;I'm much more interested in conceptualizing.&quot;   To focus managers' attention, Mr. Claytor bombarded themwith reports of broken doors, burned-out lights and delays.After one trip, he wrote 10 pages worth. Now, each ofAmtrak's 18 top executives must file a dozen trip reports ayear.   &quot;Mr. Claytor leads by being vociferously demanding, and hedoesn't hesitate to chew people out,&quot; says Timothy Gardner, avice president. &quot;When he started here, people were terrifiedof him, but now there's a lot of affection for him.&quot;   When staffers gave him a paste-on skin thermometer said tomeasure stress, he obligingly affixed it to his hand andnoted its &quot;calm&quot; reading. &quot;I don't get stress, I givestress,&quot; he joked.   Mr. Claytor instituted training programs for managers andpromoted those showing the tightest grasp of railroadoperations. Eight years ago, &quot;the people they had in middleand lower management were bush league,&quot; says M.D. &quot;Mike&quot;Ongerth, an assistant vice president of Southern PacificTransportation Co. &quot;Now, I see a very professional cadre ofmanagers.&quot;   Amtrak likes to point to its gains in operations. Revenueincreased to $1.27 billion last year from $758.8 million in1984, and Metroliner revenue doubled. Ridership is up onAmtrak's Western long-distance trains, which cater tovacationers with movies, scenery guides and meals preparedfrom fresh ingredients.   Stations are being rebuilt. For $150 million of federaland private funds, Washington's Union Station has beenrestored to its 1907 grandeur.   Mr. Claytor capitalized on higher demand for rail travelto raise fares 55% in eight years. He has expanded incomefrom real estate, mail handling, fiber-optic cable leases andthe commuter trains Amtrak operates under contract forMaryland and Massachusetts.   All the while, he repeatedly fought off Reaganadministration attacks on Amtrak's &quot;mobile money-burningmachine&quot; that serves less than 1% of intercity travelers. Intime, he convinced a majority in Congress of Amtrak'sfinancial progress and its growing popularity among travelersput off by highway and airport congestion.   A Harvard Law graduate who skippered destroyer escorts inWorld War II, Mr. Claytor practiced law for 20 years beforejoining Southern Railway in 1963. He quickly became chiefexecutive, retiring in 1977 to serve as Navy secretary,acting transportation secretary and deputy defense secretaryunder President Carter.   Steam locomotives and passenger trains fascinate Mr.Claytor; his Georgetown townhouse has floor-to-ceilingshelves of antique toy trains. But his job occasionallyrequires a cutback in train service, a step he has provedwilling to take. For example, he overcame opposition from St.Petersburg, Fla., officials to end service there andsubstitute buses from the Tampa railroad station, saving $1.3million a year.   But his style draws criticism. &quot;Claytor is an arrogantaristocrat, autocrat and plutocrat,&quot; says Austin Coates, thepresident of the United Rail Passenger Alliance, a passengergroup. &quot;He runs Amtrak like the military, and that's a moralekiller.&quot; Howard Prevette, a Galesburg, Ill., conductor, isstill smarting from losing 10 days' pay because last Octoberhe failed to alert an engineer to slow down past a trackgang. &quot;They ought to take {Mr. Claytor's} paycheck away fromhim whenever he makes a mistake,&quot; Mr. Prevette says.   Mr. Claytor defends tough discipline. &quot;Operating arailroad is, in effect, a military organization and has to bedone as close to letter-perfect as can be,&quot; he says. &quot;If arule is in effect, by God, you got to comply with it.&quot;   Others are skeptical of Mr. Claytor's plan to make Amtrakbreak even. &quot;He obviously has an incentive to say thateventually Amtrak will be self-sufficient,&quot; says David Boazof the Cato Institute, a conservative policy group. &quot;He istrying to keep the subsidies going until 1999, and in theyear 2000 there will be another excuse.&quot;   Indeed, Mr. Claytor has had setbacks. A costly move toextend train service to Atlantic City, N.J., last May hasfailed to wean many gamblers from cars and buses. And Amtraktrains have been delayed by freight railroads' moves toconsolidate traffic on fewer lines. When the Illinois Centralsaid it wanted to reroute Amtrak's City of New Orleans to aslow-speed, unsignaled track south of Memphis, Mr. Claytordug in his heels. &quot;Wholly unsatisfactory. We'd get aninjunction,&quot; he says. Edward Moyers, the Illinois Centralpresident, now plays down his proposal as &quot;just adiscussion.&quot;   Mr. Claytor's attempt to cut costs and keep passenger carsin service by postponing some maintenance led to passengercomplaints about worn carpets, ripped seats and brokentoilets. He reversed the policy in 1988. Now, Amtrak puts itscars in the shop for preventive maintenance at least threetimes a year.   Mr. Claytor has updated some Amtrak repair shops withassembly-line methods he used at the highly efficientSouthern. But he still sees big savings possible if Amtrakends rigid craft distinctions among shop workers. And he sayshe can raise productivity by building shelters overpassenger-car yards in New York and Chicago to shieldmechanics servicing cars in rain and snow.   To increase ridership, Amtrak wants to buy hundreds ofpassenger cars, including new Viewliner cars now being testedas replacements for 40-year-old dining and sleeping cars. Toreduce Metroliner delays and increase efficiency, he plans toinstall servicing facilities on station platforms and torebuild the cars to enable engineers to operate the trainsfrom either end. In Sweden, he recently looked at tilt trainsthat could take curves faster.   Despite his age, Mr. Claytor says he hasn't any plans toretire from his $99,500-a-year job in the &quot;foreseeablefuture.&quot; He received a vote of confidence last fall whensupporters in Congress roundly defeated a motion to cut offAmtrak subsidies.   Rep. Robert Walker, a Pennsylvania Republican who hadproposed the cutoff, complained that &quot;Amtrak is eating up$600 million of subsidies while we fail to maketransportation investments for the next century.&quot; But Mr.Claytor, relishing his victory, comments: &quot;Mr. Walker saysAmtrak is the past. In my opinion, it's the past, present andfuture.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
