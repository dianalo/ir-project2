The SPK agency said about 10,000 people, including CambodianCommunist Party officials and military officers, lined the banks ofthe Mekong River to bid farewell to soldiers of Division 339.   Red banners expressing gratitude to the soldiers were flying andmany people waved miniature Vietnamese and Cambodian flags as thefleet passed, the agency said. An army band played songs praisingCambodia-Vietnam friendship and hundreds of schoolchildren and otherpeople shouted slogans hailing the soldiers' service.   The fleet then sailed southward for the 70-mile journey to theborder of southern Vietnam. A large group of foreign journalistsinvited to watch the pullout followed in helicopters.   The agency said Cambodians bade farewell to other departingVietnamese soldiers in ceremonies in Ratanakiri province in thenortheast, in Kampot province south of Phnom Penh, and in KompongCham province east of the capital.   The report monitored in Bangkok did not say how many troops wereinvolved in the movements.   The largest guerrilla group, the Khmer Rouge, called themovements mere troop rotations and said Vietnam had sent in freshunits by land and sea.   The departing soldiers are among the 50,000 troops that Vietnamsays are being sent home this year in its seventh annual partialwithdrawal from Cambodia. Vietnam claims to have pulled out 32,000troops already this year, and 18,000 more are to leave by land andwater in a weeklong transfer ending Wednesday.   Some Western diplomats in Bangkok say they believe only 15,000 to20,000 soldiers have left this year.   The soldiers have been fighting a largely stalemated war againstCambodian guerrillas since massive Vietnamese divisions invadedCambodia on Christmas Day 1978 and installed the pro-Vietnamesegovernment of President Heng Samrin.   Vietnam says it will withdraw by 1990 the 50,000 troops that itsays will remain after this week's pullout, leaving the fighting toHeng Samrin's forces.   Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen said Friday that all Vietnamesemilitary and civilian advisers have already left his country.   ``This will not affect the balance of forces on the battlefielddue to our Cambodian troops, who are in control of all areas fromwhich the Vietnamese have withdrawn,'' he told a news conference.   The Khmer Rouge said Vietnamese soldiers, not those of theCambodian government, are engaged in ``tense, continuous fighting''in the interior and along the western border with Thailand.   ``They have also ordered Vietnamese aggressor troops in Cambodiato disguise as Cambodian puppet soldiers,'' it said in a radiobroadcast Sunday. The text was seen today. ``They have hidden theseimportant combined units in areas that are inaccessible toforeigners and far from populated areas and strategic roads.''   Claims by the communist Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds ofthousands of people when it ruled Cambodia until Vietnam's invasion,are widely regarded as exaggerated.</TEXT></DOC>
