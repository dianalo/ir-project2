The Center for Responsive Politics complained there is no way ofknowing whether the money quietly finds its way into congressionaland presidential elections, where spending is strictly limitedunder the Federal Election Commission.   Federal law prohibits any corporate or union money in federalcampaigns, and limits individuals' contributions to $1,000 percandidate. But many states have no limits on individualcontributions and permit labor and corporate contributions to stateparties.   The state party then can spend the money on voter outreachefforts, such as voter registration and state conventions, that canend up helping candidates for president or Congress as well. Suchfunds are known as soft money.   The Center For Responsive Politics, a non-profit, bipartisangroup, said it could document $3.3 million in soft moneycontributions from corporations during the 1985-86 election seasonin five states.   ``There is currently no way to precisely determine the extent towhich soft money is in fact being used to finance federal asopposed to state activities,'' the report said.   Most of nearly 1,700 soft money contributions disclosed werefrom corporations. Fewer than 10 were from labor unons, and thosedonations were in the $100 to $200 range, the study said.   It listed top givers as American Continental Corp. of Phoenix,which gave $85,000 to the California Democratic Party in 1986, andAtlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles, which gave a total of$89,000 to the state Democratic and Republican parties.   The largest individual contribution identified by the center wasfrom Charles Keating, chairman of the board of AmericanContinental, who gave $100,000 to the Florida GOP.   According to public records cited by the center: In Colorado,the top-dollar donor was CCS Automation systems, Inc. which gave$30,000 to the Republicans; in Florida, S.W. Florida Enterprises,Inc., which gave $20,000 to the Democrats; in Missouri, BruceInvestment Co., which gave $34,082 to the Republicans, and inWashington, Boeing Co., which gave a total of $42,700 to bothparties.   The group said it was not accusing any corporation or laborunion of illegality, since such contributions are legal in thestates studied, but it said there is a potential for abuse.   Soft money is not required by law to be reported at the federallevel. And only some states have strict reporting requirements.   ``We have no idea how the soft money is mixed with the hardmoney,'' said Ellen Miller, the group's executive director. ``We donot know for what purpose the moeny was given or how it was used.''   ``It gives individuals and corporations and labor unions onemore avenue to flex their muscle with candiates and parties.''   Noting that FEC reports document nearly a billion dollars inspending in congressional campaigns and presidential races, Millersaid, ``Lying just below the surface are untold millions ofadditional dollars unaccounted for by the FEC.''   For this year's presidential election, each national politicalparty plans to raise soft money to augment the maximum $8 millionit is allowed to spend to elect its nominee. In addition to theparty expenditure, each candidate gets $46 million from the federalTreasury to wage his campaign.   The finance chairman for likely Democratic nominee MichaelDukakis says he wants to raise $42 million in soft money for thefall campaign.   Based on reports filed with the five states involved in the newstudy _ California, Colorado, Florida, Missouri and Washington _the center identified the following amounts in corporatecontributions to state parties in 1985-86:   California: Republicans, $808,290; Democrats, $295,389.   Colorado: Republicans, $645,888; Democrats, $71,050.   Florida: Republicans, $466,445; Democrats, $458,258.   Missouri: Republicans, $369,482; Democrats, $22,400.   Washington: Republicans, $129,776; Democrats, $31,250.   The center's report noted that McDonald's heir Joan Kroc gave $1million to the Democratic National Committee a few months ago. Atmost, $20,000 of that could be used on federal elections under thelaw, meaning at least $980,000 would go into the DNC's soft-moneyaccounts.   The report also noted published reports of gifts to theRepublican National Committee of $150,000 from Texas developerTrammell Crow, $127,600 from Phillip Morris Corp. and $124,000 fromAtlantic Richfield.   Soft money also can go into national party funds forconstruction of party buildings. The report said the Democrats got$50,000 from the painters' union, $10,000 from the United AutoWorkers and $5,000 from the machinists' union for its building fund.   It cited contributions to the Republican National Committee fundof $40,000 from Bethlehem Steel and $24,120 from Drexel, Burnham,Lambert.</TEXT></DOC>
