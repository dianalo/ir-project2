Sources close to the bargaining said that USX, the nation's No. 1 steelmaker, made &quot;substantial progress&quot; on several important issues during a weekend of marathon negotiations. The strike, affecting 22,000 steelworkers in eight states, today enters its 165th day.    &quot;We can finally see some light at the end of the tunnel, but we're not there yet,&quot; said one source, who added, &quot;It's the hardest bargaining I can ever remember.&quot;    Resolution of the contract dispute would -- for the second time in a week -- end a crisis for the embattled steel and energy giant. On Thursday, New York investor Carl C. Icahn, who had threatened a takeover of USX, dropped his $31-a-share, or $7.19 billion, bid for the company.    An end to the work stoppage would also free management, particularly Chairman David M. Roderick, to focus energy on two major programs -- a much-delayed corporate restructuring promised by month's end and a widely anticipated revamping of the troubled steel operations.    Responding to takeover fears, USX retained two investment banking firms in September to prepare a study of how the company might restructure to enhance the value of its shares. USX received the report in November, and management is thought to have completed its evaluation. &quot;It's still up in the air where we go from here,&quot; said one company source. &quot;It's a question of Roderick making up his mind. He has his own personal timetable for doing this.&quot;    Sources close to the labor talks meanwhile said the contract taking shape grants USX wage and benefit givebacks on the order of those won by Bethlehem Steel Corp., the nation's No. 3 steelmaker. Steelworkers there took cuts last spring totaling about $2 an hour.    In return, USX has moved toward meeting the union's demand for limiting the use of outside contractors to perform steel mill work. Subcontracting has enabled the company to slash its steelmaking costs but has cost the beleaguered union thousands of jobs. Curbing the practice at USX is the Steelworkers' top priority.    In addition, the company has eased its stance toward eliminating mill jobs through craft combinations -- an effort to improve labor productivity. Sources said USX now proposes eliminating only 1,020 jobs, compared with 1,503 positions under its previous offer in November.    Still unclear, though, was whether union negotiators have succeeded in wresting a stock or cash payback plan through which steelworkers could recoup all or a portion of the concessions. Also unknown was whether the eventual contract would provide any assurances that USX won't later shutter extensive portions of its seven steel works.    Progress in the stalemated talks followed the mid-December entrance of mediator Sylvester Garrett, a veteran steel industry arbitrator who has prodded both sides toward middle ground. Under the attorney's tutelage, USX's Mr. Roderick and union President Lynn R. Williams met twice last week while their staffs worked into the early morning, exchanging several sets of contract proposals.    USX failed to reach a settlement by Friday night as hoped, despite an all-night bargaining session that carried through most of Saturday. Sources said Messrs. Roderick and Williams could meet again as early as today to conclude final details. &quot;Sooner or later, we're going to have something for them; the question is just precisely when,&quot; said one source, who assessed the chances of breaking off negotiations as remote. &quot;Still, there are lots of loose ends to be ironed out.&quot;    The intensity of bargaining points up the growing pain to both sides.    On the picket line, steelworkers are growing restless. State and company-paid unemployment benefits have begun to run out, leaving strikers only $60 a week from the union's strike fund. Others have exhausted their savings, and the loss of company-paid health insurance has saddled some with huge bills. Meanwhile, their counterparts at other producers have continued work as usual.    Though leverage has shifted to USX, the steelmaker is paying a price, too. In addition to monthly costs estimated at more than $100 million, USX needs rank-and-file ratification this month to hold onto orders for the second quarter, customarily the industry's busiest time of the year.    Moreover, with Mr. Icahn at bay for now, it is believed that Mr. Roderick wants to wrap up a labor contract before reporting his restructuring recommendations to USX directors later this month. USX has cited at least a dozen options, ranging from the sale of foreign oil properties to the spinoff of its steel unit. </TEXT></DOC>
