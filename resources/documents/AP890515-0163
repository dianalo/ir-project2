James Wieghart, speaking for independent counsel Lawrence E.Walsh, said the matter was brought to the attention of the courtand North's attorneys ``when we learned of the relationship fromthe secretary'' at the end of North's trial in the Iran-Contraaffair.   Denise Anderson, the foreman of North's jury, said in aninterview in this week's People magazine that she bumped into hercousin Gertrude Griffin, but did not discuss the case with her anddid not report the meeting or the relationship to the court.   ``She knew her job, and I knew mine,'' Anderson said. ``Justbecause she worked for Keker didn't mean diddlywink.''   John Keker prosecuted the independent counsel's case againstNorth.   Wieghart said Ms. Griffin worked at the independent counsel'soffice at the federal courthouse during the trial and that shewasn't Keker's personal secretary.   The relationship came up at the end of the trial before the juryreceived its instructions from U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard A.Gesell.   Gesell held a closed-door session on the matter with Griffinpresent and North lawyer Brendan Sullivan questioned her. Therecord of that proceeding is sealed.   Anderson and her 11 fellow jurors convicted North, a formerMarine colonel and National Security Council staffer, on threefelony counts in the Iran-Contra affair and acquitted him of nineothers.</TEXT></DOC>
