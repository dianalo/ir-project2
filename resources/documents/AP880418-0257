Olson, the forceful chairman ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. who got his start cleaning siltout of manholes, died early today of cancer, the company announced.   Olson, who had led the telecommunications giant since the fallof 1986, had been operated on late last month for a tumor in thecolon.   He was 62. The company said he died at home.   ATandamp;T President Robert E. Allen, who took over from Olson afterhe became ill last month, will continue to direct the company untilthe board of directors elects a new chairman, company spokeswomanLynda Beighley said.   ATandamp;T's directors will meet around the time of the annual meetingWednesday in Denver, but Ms. Beighley said she could not say if achairman would be picked at that time.   Olson became ill with flu on March 18 and had surgery seven dayslater. He returned home April 1 and had been undergoingchemotherapy as an outpatient since that time.   ``All of us in the company are shocked at the suddenness ofJim's death,'' Allen said in a statement. ``He was a dynamic andvisionary leader. We will miss him. Our legacy to him will be thevigor with which we carry out the strategic course he laid out forus during his 20 months as our leader.''   Allen, 52, is the company's president and chief operatingofficer.   Olson had made ATandamp;T more aggressive, more cost-conscious andmore certain of its direction since taking office in September 1986.   Analysts said the company had drifted in the first years afterthe historic breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1, 1984, when localphone service was split into seven regional Bell holding companies.   Olson, who landed his first job in the Bell System at age 17,was considered a take-charge executive with an emphasis on gettingresults. Disdaining the fashion of corporate boardrooms, the beefyexecutive wore short-sleeved shirts throughout his career.   ``Jim Olson was the ultimate tough guy. ... I think he instilleda real sense of pride and determination in an ATandamp;T workforce thatat that time needed it,'' said Jack Grubman, an analyst forPaineWebber Inc.   ``I think he leaves ATandamp;T in good hands,'' Grubman said. ``Ifthis had happened a year ago, it would have been extremelydisruptive.''   Allen is widely considered to be ATandamp;T's almost certain choice asa successor to Olson. ``He is a big-picture guy,'' Grubman said.``His style is probably more overtly executive (than Olson's),'' hesaid.   Olson, a native of Devils Lake, N.D., was born Dec. 3, 1925. Hisfirst job, in which he cleaned manholes, was as a splicer's helperin 1943 with Northwestern Bell Telephone Co. in Grand Forks, N.D.   Twenty-three years later, Olson had moved through the ranks ofthe company to become vice president and general manager in itsIowa area. He was transferred to Indiana Bell as vice president foroperations in 1970 and became president of that company two yearslater.   In 1974, Olson assumed the presidency of Illinois Bell and in1977 became executive vice president of ATandamp;T headquarters in NewYork. He was made president and chief operating officer in June1985 after serving as vice chairman of the board since 1979.   Olson was a graduate of the University of North Dakota andserved on the boards of many companies, business organizations andcharitable groups. Olson is survived by his wife, Jean; a son,James D. Olson; a daughter, Mrs. Bruce Paterson; a brother and twosisters.   Olson's undisclosed illness was reminiscent of that of WilliamMcGowan, the chairman of ATandamp;T's long-distance rival MCICommunications Corp., who suffered a heart attack in December 1986,received a heart transplant and returned to office in September1987.   Both companies drew criticism for failing to announce theirchiefs' illnesses until news leaked out to the press.</TEXT></DOC>
