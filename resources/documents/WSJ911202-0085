In their complaint the producers assertthat Soviet imports surged to more than six million pounds in1990 from almost nothing before 1987, and now account for 25%of all uranium imports and 17% of the U.S. utilities'requirements. The producers have petitioned the department toprescribe antidumping duties of 132% to 160% on the Sovietproducts and services in order to offset their allegedlyunfair price advantage over domestic supplies.   The U.S. uranium industry said the price-depressing effectof the Soviet shipments could cost it nearly $50 million thisyear.   The Soviet Ministry of Atomic Energy and Industry and itsforeign trading arm, V/O Techsnabexport, are the main targetsof the petition. However, it's Technsnabexport's chief U.S.importer, Nuexco Trading Corp., that's likely to lead theopposition in proceedings on the complaint both by theCommerce Department and the U.S. International TradeCommission.   &quot;The Soviets aren't dumping,&quot; asserted Frederick Boyne,the corporate relations director of Denver-based Nuexco.&quot;They are selling uranium at world-wide competitive prices.&quot;   U.S. utilities are still figuring how to respond to thisthreat to their newly found foreign supplies. &quot;We still don'thave a firm position, but we have expressed our concern aboutthis petition, and are asking that all aspects of it beinvestigated,&quot; said Gerald Charnoff, a lawyer for the EdisonElectric Institute, the utilities' trade group, and fiveindividual power companies.   Lawyers involved in the case said that the EnergyDepartment may intervene at some point on behalf of the U.S.producers. The department has certified for many years thatfalling uranium prices and lowered nuclear power demands haveseriously hurt the industry's viability. The department's ownuranium enrichment operations also are threatened by Sovietcompetition.   The State Department is yet to weigh in, but the U.S.importers hope that its interest in bailing out the Sovieteconomy would work in their favor. &quot;It's difficult to squarethis case with the foreign policy of the U.S.,&quot; said Mr.Boyne.   For the petition to succeed, the ITC has to verify thatthe U.S. industry has been injured by these imports and theCommerce Department has to determine that the products arebeing dumped, or sold in the U.S. below production costs orbelow the equivalent of home-market prices. The proceedingscould last as long 280 days.</TEXT></DOC>
