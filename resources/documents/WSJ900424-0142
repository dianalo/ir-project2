Amanda is in the third grade.</LP><TEXT>   Such elaborate analysis grew out of a determined effort inConnecticut to zero in on where schools are failing and makeofficials bring them up to snuff. Thanks to statewide tests,school officials in this Hartford suburb found out four yearsago that their fourth and sixth graders were well below theaverage in writing. Acting on this, they pushed a programcalled &quot;process writing,&quot; focusing on organization andrevision. At Metacomet Elementary School here, large signs onthe walls list the steps: pre-writing, drafting, revising,editing and publishing.   It seems to be helping. &quot;In the past, you told kids towrite an essay, and either they could or they couldn't,&quot; saysPortia Mendez, Metacomet's principal. &quot;Now they know how tobegin. If you tell them to write about their vacation, theywrite the word `vacation' and then start putting down theirother thoughts -- television, playground, New York -- andthey can weave a story around them.&quot;   The Connecticut plan has blazed a trail that educators andpoliticians from President Bush down are now starting tofollow in a national effort to enhance education. The idea isto set statewide goals and make school officials accountablefor results.   The approach is somewhat unusual. In the U.S., educationhas long been primarily a local responsibility. Although mostAmerican students take a battery of standardized tests, thereisn't enough uniformity to give a coherent picture of whereschools are improving. And the U.S., unlike most otherindustrial nations, has no national standards, no nationalgraduation tests and no national courses.   Connecticut decided seven years ago to try standards on astatewide basis. To begin, &quot;We asked a very simple question:What skills should we ask children to master?&quot; explainsGerald Tirozzi, the state's commissioner of education.   Committees of teachers drafted grade-level achievementgoals. Then they devised tests to measure how well eachstudent, class, school and district was reaching theobjectives. The Connecticut Mastery Test was born. Now, everyOctober, all fourth, sixth and eighth graders in the statetake the test, which measures their competence in the ThreeR's, reading, writing and arithmetic.   The heart of it is a 45-minute writing exercise. An examfor sixth graders last fall asked them to &quot;pretend you couldlive anywhere in the world. . . . Write a composition aboutthis place.&quot;   Multiple-choice tests in math measure computational andproblem-solving skills, as well as the ability to interpretdata from graphs and charts. A reading test measurescomprehension and such higher-order skills as the ability todraw inferences.   Each December, school officials get detailed scores oneach child. Parents also get a report. In January,school-district results &quot;are published on the front page ofevery newspaper in the state, and if a superintendent wantsto keep his job, he'd better make sure his schools do well,&quot;says Paul Copes, Bloomfield's superintendent of schools.   The net result is to make school officials moreaccountable for the progress of students than in the past.Mr. Copes calls the tests &quot;a public report card&quot; that hasmade it possible for voters and parents to see how Bloomfieldschools stack up against others in the state. Mary Eberle,the chairwoman of Bloomfield's board of education, says thatin the early years, the tests were &quot;instrumental in showingthe teachers that they weren't doing the job&quot; and helpingteachers and administrators focus on ways to improveteaching.   Some educational critics complain that U.S. public schoolsalready inflict too many standardized tests on theirstudents, and that teachers, under pressure to showimprovement, &quot;teach to the test.&quot; School officials here inBloomfield don't think so. &quot;The mastery tests measurelife-long skills -- how to write, how to approach a problem,how to estimate a solution,&quot; Mr. Copes contends. &quot;You can'tdo well on the test by rote memory.&quot;   The concept of accountability is gaining support,especially as other reforms fail to produce results. Over thepast decade, most states have focused their improvementefforts on requirements, spending, resources, and tighteninggraduation standards. Yet scores on standardized tests remainlow and employers complain that high-school graduates can'tread and reason well enough to be skilled workers.   Here in Connecticut, Mr. Copes took over a district thatthe state, through its testing, had just named one of the 20weakest. In 1986, Bloomfield fell below the state average onseven of the nine tests (three each for three grades).   Last year, it was below the average on just three tests.Like a Japanese factory, Bloomfield has lifted schoolperformance by responding to test results with relentlessattention to detail. &quot;We have made adjustments in what weteach and how we teach it,&quot; Mr. Copes says. &quot;When I look atthe scores, I want to know if this is a system problem, aschool problem or a teacher problem. If it's a systemproblem, it's probably the curriculum. If it's a schoolproblem, it may be leadership. If it's a classroom problem,it may be an instructional&quot; deficiency, he says.   When performance on the sixth-grade writing test fellsharply after three years of steady improvement, &quot;upon reviewwe found some areas we could improve upon,&quot; thesuperintendent continues. &quot;The frequency of writing, themonitoring of writing folders and the variety of writingwasn't what we thought it should be.&quot; Hence the writingprogram that has third graders elaborately analyzing oneanother's writing.   The attention Bloomfield teachers pay to writing isunusual. In a recent nationwide survey, only 61% of 11thgraders said their teachers routinely mark mistakes on whatthey write, while only 31% said their teachers commonly pointout what is well done. Possibly as a result, the survey foundthat only 28% of 11th-graders could write an adequate letterto a senator supporting a position on the space program.   At Bloomfield, fine-tuning occurs in other subjects too.&quot;In math we developed a skill card for each grade level,&quot;says Mary Smith, assistant superintendent. &quot;There arerequired objectives that teachers have to cover every markingperiod. It keeps a teacher from going over and over the sametopic for too long.&quot; The tests pinpoint students who needextra help, which is required by the state for those who fallbelow a certain level.   Since the testing began, performance across Connecticuthas improved slowly but steadily. When the first group offourth graders took the tests in 1985, only 58.6% scoredabove the remedial standard on all three tests: math,language arts (which includes writing) and reading. Lastyear, 65% scored above the remedial standard on all threetests.   Bloomfield has shown progress too. In 1985, when onlyfourth graders took the tests, 39% of those in Bloomfieldneeded remedial work in reading. By last fall, when thesechildren were in eighth grade, just 19% needed remedial work.Math and writing have improved as well. &quot;I'm looking to theday when there are no remedial classes in the high school,&quot;Mr. Copes says.   As a black superintendent in a district where 75% of thestudents are black, he says he has another incentive: &quot;Thechallenge is to demonstrate that something largely minoritycan be excellent.&quot;   In its improvement drive, Bloomfield changed some of theways its schools operate. Elementary schools eliminated arecess and reduced the number of times children move from oneroom to another, such as the music room, thus adding 45minutes a day to time available for teaching. Principals gotmore authority over their teaching staffs and instructionprograms.   Teachers now closely check homework performance, andstudents who fall behind must complete their work duringspecial periods, sometimes on Saturday mornings. Mrs. Eberle,the board of education chairwoman, says she learned that thepolicy was having an impact when a student asked her to signa petition protesting longer homework assignments. (Sherefused.) Parents of fourth graders and younger are asked toread to their children 10 minutes a night.   The schools monitor teacher performance more carefully andhold more after-school meetings to discuss curriculum andtechniques. &quot;The teachers have been required to do atremendous amount of extra work,&quot; says Raymond Froscio,president of the local teachers' union, which is affiliatedwith the National Education Association. Vaughn Ranseur, viceprincipal in the high school, says that because of theincreased accountability, managers in the system face&quot;greater stress.&quot;   But the unions and managers generally support the program.One reason is that to compensate for the added effort,Connecticut has lifted the average teacher salaries 41% since1986, to $41,600 a year. The union's Mr. Froscio thinks it'sreasonable for school districts to expect greateraccountability as salaries rise.   A growing number of educators see value in the concepts ofaccountability and testing. &quot;We have lots of tests, but wereally don't have any norms,&quot; notes Chester E. Finn Jr.,chairman of the National Assessment Government Board, whichruns the federally funded National Assessment of EducationalProgress (NAEP is the outfit that issues highly publicizedreports on how little students know). &quot;Hence,&quot; he says, &quot;wehave no clear sense of the result we seek from the efforts weare making at school reform, or how good would be goodenough.&quot;   Critics who question the value of standardized tests saythey raise the chances that national standards will beimposed on local schools. Beverly Greenberg, a member of theConnecticut board of education, worries that even the statetests compromise local control, while overlooking importantdifferences. &quot;I don't think every community is the same, andI don't think every kid's needs are the same. I worry thatstandardization will make everybody the same shade of gray,&quot;she says. But she concedes that the tests &quot;have pushedcommunities to improve basic skills.'   Initially, some superintendents and school boards resistedthe larger state role, but the state board of education usedan open, public process in formulating achievement goals anddesigning tests that made sense to the teachers. &quot;Most of usbelieve they are among the best tests in the country,&quot; saysEdward Reidy, the instructional director in the West Hartfordschool system. Besides fourth, sixth and eighth graders, thestate is considering testing 10th graders.   After establishing the mastery test system, Connecticutalso drafted a broad outline, called the Common Core ofLearning, of what it expects students to be able to do whenthey complete high school. The standards are broad enough toavoid being mistaken for a state curriculum.   &quot;We need a more common set of standards in this country,&quot;Mr. Reidy argues. &quot;We don't want to lose local flavor orcontrol. But the fact is that our kids compete with kids fromall over the world, not just from Hartford.&quot;   ---                  Blackboard Responsibility                                                                                                          To broaden accountability, Connecticut is also consideringrequiring school-by-school reports of:                                                                                                          -- Drop-out rates                                                                                                          -- Student attendance                                                                                                          -- Achievement test results                                                                                                          -- Percentage of students going to college                                                                                                          -- Scholastic Aptitude Test scores                                                                                                          -- Results on college Advance Placement tests</TEXT></DOC>
