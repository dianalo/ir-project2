The current monthly production rate of 10 aircraft will be stepped up to about 20 by the mid-1990s, when Airbus expects to deliver more than 200 airliners a year. Only last year, the production rate for the mid-1990s had been planned at 15 aircraft a month. The rate of 20 a month could be increased further, depending on market demand, said the consortium, owned by aerospace companies in France, West Germany, Britain and Spain.    The decision partly reflects additions to the Airbus family of jets. The consortium has three basic product lines: the widebody A-300-600 and A-310; the short-range to medium-range, single-aisle A-320 and A321; and the planned, longer-range A-330 and A-340. </TEXT></DOC>
