ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential contenders Bob Dole and Jack Kempinvoked President Reagan's name today trying to stem a George Bushtide on Super Tuesday, as the Democrats focused on Texas the daybeore the most delegate-rich showdown in political history.   In Washington, a federal judge dismissed GOP candidate PatRobertson's $35 million libel suit against a former congressman whoquestioned his Korean war record.   Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts, the leader in polls ofTexas and Florida Democrats, met with senior citizens at a NorthMiami Beach condominium development.   On Sunday he campaigned in Spanish as he appealed to Hispanicvoters in Texas and then flew to Georgia where he met with formerPresident Carter.   Robertson was in Texas and told an audience in Abilene, ``Thefrontier that beckons us today is the energy frontier.''   The former television evangelist got the endorsement of DianeDenman, vice chairman of the Texas Republican Party, who said sheknows all the candidates ``but without a doubt, I've got moreconfidence that it is Pat Robertson who will provide the unswervingcommitment to the conservative beliefs that are needed to seeAmerica into the 1990s.''   Dole told a news conference in Atlanta that ``polls dodemonstrate that I beat all the Democrats. He (Bush) doesn't beatany of them. ... We're trying to continue to Reaganize theRepublican Party, to let it grow.''   Kemp, struggling to survive after finishing no better than thirdin any contest so far, told an audience at Louisiana StateUniversity, ``I think the Republican Party wants a ReaganRepublican progressive conservative to be nominated and frankly,George Bush, Bob Dole and Pat Robertson don't qualify.''   ``We are in the race,'' insisted Kemp, brushing aside questionsof how well he had to do on Tuesday to survive.   While Dukakis met with Carter, Sen. Albert Gore Jr. of Tennesseepicked up backing from another influential Georgian, Sen. Sam Nunn.As the Georgia senator left for a week-long trip to the SovietUnion, his office released a statement saying he had cast hisabsentee ballot for Gore because ``his views come closest to my ownviews as to the steps our nation must take to meet our challengesat home and abroad.''   Four of Dukakis' rivals _ Jesse Jackson, Gary Hart, Rep. RichardGephardt of Missouri and Gore _ were in Texas today, as wasRobertson. Bush was ending his campaign day in his hometown ofHouston.   Texas, which votes with 19 other states on Tuesday, offers atrove of 183 Democratic delegates and 111 on the Republican side.   In Washington, U.S. District Judge Joyce Hens Green signed abrief order dismissing Robertson's libel suit ``with prejudice,''which means that former Rep. Paul N. McCloskey Jr., R-Calif. islegally the victor in the dispute.   Robertson accepted the condition the judge imposed on Friday ina one-sentence letter from his attorney Douglas V. Rigler that wasdelivered to the judge's chambers by messenger.   Under terms of the dismissal, Robertson must pay court fees,printing costs and court reporters' fees, but not McCloskey'sattorney's fees, which he has said total about $400,000.   ``This is a confirmation of my integrity,'' McCloskey said todayin a telephone interview from his home in San Francisco. ``I don'tlike at the age of 60 to be called a pathological liar all over theUnited States. He is admitting that he is the one who is the liar.''   Dole conceded Sunday he was involved in ``a long, hard fight''for the GOP nomination and he had little cause for optimism abouthis prospects on Tuesday when 17 states hold Republican primariesand 20 hold Democratic contests.   There are 712 Republican and 1,307 Democratic delegates atstake, including the four to be selected from American Samoa.   Southern and border states dominate the day and William Brock,Dole's campaign manager, said Bush held a ``2-1 or a 3-1 lead invirtually every Southern state.''   The vice president demonstrated his strength in the region onSaturday when he overwhelmed his rivals in the South Carolinaprimary and swept the state's 37 delegates.   On the Democratic side, Dukakis looked strongest with leads insurveys in Texas and Florida, the two biggest Super Tuesday states,and a lock on his home state of Massachusetts, which also votes onTuesday.   ``It could be he'll come out of Super Tuesday thefront-runner,'' said a Gephardt aide of Dukakis.   But Carter, during his meeting Sunday evening with Dukakis,predicted no clear winner on Tuesday.   Jackson's support in the black community gives him the biggestSouthern base of any candidate. Interviewed Sunday on the ABCprogram, ``This Week With David Brinkley,'' he said, ``I'm runningstrong in the South,'' but he refused to predict how many delegateshe might win in the region.   Gore appeared on the same program and conceded he needs to winmore than his home state of Tennessee on Tuesday. He predicted hewould carry ``several other'' states, but refused to say which ones.   Robertson was interviewed on the NBC show ``Meet the Press'' andsaid that if he doesn't get 200 to 300 delegates on Tuesday ``itwill be difficult.''   The vast Super Tuesday landscape was too much for any candidateto cover in person. Millions of dollars was being spent to reachvoters through television and radio commercials, with many of thecandidates trying to sell themselves by attacking their rivals.   Gephardt commercials accused Dukakis of dirty tricks againstother Democratic contenders, while the Massachusetts governor wasrunning an ad showing an acrobat doing flips, a pointed referenceto Gephardt shifts on issues.   Dole continued to run commercials attacking Bush for his role inthe Iran-Contra affair, while the vice president was portraying theKansas senator as straddling on taxes.</TEXT></DOC>
