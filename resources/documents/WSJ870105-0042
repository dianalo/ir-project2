HuntStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   With the Democrats resuming control of the Senate this week, Richard Lugar's two-year stint as Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman is over. But he has left a mark.    The usually cautious and colorless 54-year-old Indiana Republican -- previously known as Richard Nixon's favorite mayor from his days as chief executive of Indianapolis -- surprised even his admirers by his forcefulness as chairman. In the process, he restored some of the prestige and prowess the committee once held but had lost over the past decade -- and seems likely to lose again.    As chairman, Sen. Lugar steered through the first foreign aid bill in five years, helped engineer support for the Nicaraguan Contras in 1985, prodded the administration to oppose Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos and led the overturning of President Reagan's veto of economic sanctions against South Africa. Moreover, he took a committee rife with personal fiefdoms and legislative ineptitude and crafted a consensus on elusive issues.    &quot;Lugar really helped to restore a degree of influence, cohesion and morale to the committee,&quot; says Seth Tillman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service and a former Foreign Relations staff member under Chairman J. William Fulbright.    Dick Lugar is no ideologue, but he has a clear concept of American foreign policy. He opposes what he views as the isolationism of the post-Vietnam era and supports the Reagan Doctrine's aim of checking totalitarianism around the globe. But he argues that this ought to be done in a pro-democratic fashion, opposing dictators of the right and the left to create a &quot;purpose of power.&quot;    He believes that this makes for a sensible foreign policy. More important, this veteran of more than two decades of elective politics believes it's essential to maintain domestic political support for U.S. foreign policy, a need that often isn't appreciated.    Despite some notable exceptions, the Foreign Relations panel traditionally has had little legislative influence. &quot;Over history, Foreign Relations hasn't been a particularly effective committee,&quot; notes Kenneth Shewmaker, diplomatic historian at Dartmouth College. &quot;It only has been an unusual product of circumstances and personalities that change that.&quot;    Two of those personalities were Massachusetts Republicans: Charles Sumner, a key ally of President Lincoln during the Civil War, and Henry Cabot Lodge, the resourceful foe of Woodrow Wilson after World War I. In 1947 and 1948, Republican Chairman Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan was instrumental in forging a bipartisan foreign policy with President Truman, culminating in enactment of the Marshall Plan and Truman Doctrine. From the mid 1960s to the early 1970s, the brilliant Sen. Fulbright turned the committee into a foreign-policy classroom, ranging from the psychological aspects of foreign policy to the nature and purpose of U.S. commitments around the world -- all overarched by his opposition to the Vietnam War.    The Arkansas Democrat was succeeded in 1975 by the aging and ineffective John Sparkman, who was followed by two foreign policy peacocks: Democrat Frank Church and Republican Charles Percy, men whose infatuation with the glitter of geopolitics played a role in their subsequent electoral losses.    Although Sen. Lugar was a Rhodes scholar, there was little chance that he would forget his roots, if for no other reason than his wife, Char. She has skipped state dinners that conflict with her bowling night; at eloquent parties for foreign dignitaries, she can discourse on the strategic realities of either American foreign policy or Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight.    What excited Richard Lugar about Corazon Aquino, who replaced Ferdinand Marcos as president of the Philippines, wasn't the response of the diplomatic set but the enthusiasm of the small merchants and farmers back in Indiana. He recognized the moral and political necessity of taking a stand against the South African government; his highly visible role leading the fight against President Reagan's stance helped deny that issue to the Democrats in the fall elections. He finds the latest Iranian scandal so politically stupid that he feels all the top U.S. participants should be replaced.    Such views have earned Sen. Lugar the enmity of right-wing elements, and North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms plans to challenge him this week for the ranking Republican slot on the Foreign Relations panel. But Sen. Lugar is expected to survive this test. Indeed, as the reins of the committee chairmanship are turned over to lackluster Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell, more than a few Democrats wish they had a Dick Lugar.    &quot;If we were left to our own devices in a private vote,&quot; ventures one committee Democrat, &quot;Dick Lugar would be elected chairman overwhelmingly.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
