Texaco closed at $37.50 a share, unchanged, on volume of about two million shares in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday. It was the fifth most-actively traded issue, but volume was lower than in recent days.    Some Wall Street traders said that instead of buying they preferred to wait and see what the Australian financier and takeover specialist will do.    Rumors that Sir James Goldsmith might be snapping up Texaco shares persisted yesterday. But a source close to Sir James said that the Anglo-French investor wasn't accumulating Texaco shares.    Late yesterday, Texaco officials said they still hadn't had contact with Mr. Holmes a Court. In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, the financier declared his holding of 15,507,300 Texaco common shares, which he has said is &quot;exclusively for the purpose of investment.&quot;    Houston-based Pennzoil Co., which in December 1985 won a $10.3 billion legal judgment against White Plains, N.Y.-based Texaco, declined to comment on whether it had been in contact with the Australian. It was to forestall enforcement of that judgment that Texaco filed in March for court protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.    Trading in Texaco shares has ballooned since shortly before the Chapter 11 filing. About 120 million shares -- the equivalent of nearly half of Texaco's total shares outstanding -- have changed hands since early April. Mr. Holmes a Court's purchases account for only about 13% of that volume.    Texaco said it is aware that a number of major institutional holders have been among recent sellers. The absence of dividend payments because of Texaco's filing -- as well as the restrictions against ownership of companies in Chapter 11 that govern many fiduciaries -- have made institutions net sellers of Texaco common.    So who is buying? Speculation among Wall Street sources ranges from another acquisition-minded investor or group of investors, to arbitragers with no other place to park hot money.    Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Salomon Brothers Inc. have approached institutional holders seeking to purchase blocks of 500,000 shares or more, possibly for their own arbitrage accounts, fund managers said. Dreman Value Management Inc., which holds 2.3 million Texaco shares, was approached twice in the past week by investment banking firms seeking blocks of one million shares at 25 cents to 50 cents above market value, but didn't sell.    But the heavy sales that have occurred suggest that many Texaco shares are now in the hands of speculators who put quick profits ahead of long-term gains or any loyalty to Texaco management. &quot;That stock is now held by folks interested in seeing a deal happen,&quot; said a lawyer who has regular dealings with Texaco.    Because the market value of Texaco's shares outstanding exceeds $8 billion even at today's depressed price, analysts said that it is unlikely Mr. Holmes a Court would try to take over Texaco on his own. Wall Street sources said he isn't believed to have retained a U.S. investment bank in connection with Texaco.    Mr. Holmes a Court hasn't any ties to U.S. investment banks. In taking a position last year in USX Corp., he is understood to have bought the shares through Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., which is said to have assisted him in buying Texaco shares.    Some sources pointed out, however, that Mr. Holmes a Court does have close ties to the New York law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton andamp; Garrison, which represented him in connection with his investments in USX and Asarco Inc. That law firm also remains on Pennzoil's retainer in connection with its Texaco litigation.    A reclusive 49-year-old Perth lawyer, Mr. Holmes a Court generally is considered Australia's wealthiest man. Over the past 17 years his Bell Group Ltd. has acquired interests in transportation, media, entertainment and building supplies.    As a takeover specialist, Mr. Holmes a Court is perhaps most famous for his protracted maneuvering for control of Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's largest company. Since first launching a takeover bid for Broken Hill Proprietary in 1983, he has managed to acquire 29.9% of the steel and natural resources concern.    Mr. Holmes a Court often has acquired a stake in a company, then sold out for a handsome profit as he did last year with Pittsburgh-based USX. But he insists that acquiring companies is his aim.    Ian Storey, an analyst at the Sydney, Australia, brokerage of Meares andamp; Philips Ltd., said of Mr. Holmes a Court: &quot;The Texaco play is to get in and get a whack of it to establish himself as a predator. This may attract other predators, as in the case of USX when Carl Icahn came along.&quot; Mr. Icahn, a New York investor, acquired a large stake in USX last year.    However, Mr. Storey said he believes it now is possible that Mr. Holmes a Court will move to take control of Broken Hill Proprietary as early as July. &quot;Texaco would be a very good fit with BHP,&quot; he said. &quot;In the same way as USX offered downstream steel-finishing facilities that would have fit with BHP's low-cost slab operations, Texaco offers the same kind of vertical integration with its downstream oil marketing and refining.&quot;    ---   Thomas Petzinger Jr. in Houston and Geraldine Brooks in Sydney, Australia, contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
