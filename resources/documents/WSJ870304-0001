The group would pay a total of $10 million in cash, to come out of the assets of one of the units, and as much as $98 million in notes, depending on the performance of the insurance concerns.    Such a sale would represent a &quot;clean break&quot; from the reinsurance liabilities that have plagued Wilmington, Del.-based Beneficial in recent years and led to its decision last August to restructure, according to Andrew C. Halvorsen, chief financial officer. He said the financial services concern probably would return to profitability as early as the first quarter.    As previously reported, Beneficial posted a 1986 loss of $171.6 million, primarily because of heavy reinsurance losses and costs associated with the sale of the insurance businesses. Beneficial said the 1986 loss &quot;fully reflects&quot; the proposed sale. Reinsurers share claims risks in exchange for premiums of policies written by other companies.    The management group is led by Robert Rothman, current chairman and chief executive officer of Beneficial's American Centennial Insurance Co. unit and chief financial officer of Beneficial's insurance group. The units included in the sale are: American Centennial, Wesco Insurance Co. and Beneficial International Insurance Co., including three of its subsidiaries.    Beneficial will retain three insurance units.    Terms of the agreement in principle call for Beneficial International to pay Beneficial Corp. $10 million at closing. The parent also will receive 10-year notes with a face amount of $98 million. However, Beneficial said payment of the notes is &quot;substantially dependent&quot; upon the performance of the insurance companies. &quot;The payments on the notes will all be gravy,&quot; Mr. Halvorsen said.    The transaction is subject to approval by the Delaware Insurance Commission and execution of a definitive agreement.    Anthony Pearce-Batten, an analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., said that while Beneficial is selling the units &quot;for almost nothing,&quot; he views the sale favorably because the company will &quot;sidestep future reinsurance losses.&quot; In addition, he said Beneficial could benefit from an option to purchase a 9.9% stake in two profitable Beneficial International insurance units in Britain that are being sold to the management group.    Wall Street appeared to react favorably to the news. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Beneficial common stock rose $1.75 to close at $64.50.    Beneficial's additions to American Centennial reserves in recent years and its loss taken on the planned sale of the unit totaled more than $700 million.    American Centennial, which Beneficial alleges is the victim of fraud, also faces numerous lawsuits by reinsurers that claim they, too, were defrauded. The reinsurers claim in their lawsuits that they don't owe American Centennial any money for claims. Beneficial said it is negotiating with the management-buyout group over who will be liable for the claims related to the suits. </TEXT></DOC>
