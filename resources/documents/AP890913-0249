Co-written with Adam Simon, ``Carnage,'' an unruly satire onreligious evangelism, was one of two American entries in this year'sEdinburgh International Festival. Robbins directs but does notappear in the play, which opens off-Broadway Sept. 17 at the PublicTheater for a month-long run.   ``It's kind of like our Boston, our New Haven,'' Robbins saidwith a laugh in the wee hours one recent morning at the St. Bride'sCenter in Edinburgh, where ``Carnage'' recently finished sevenperformances.   ``Carnage'' marks the New York debut of The Actors' Gang, a14-member ensemble from Los Angeles, most of whom were classmates atthe University of California at Los Angeles, Robbins' alma mater.Although the Gang has been mounting knockabout productions of suchclassic plays as ``Ubu Roi'' since 1981, they lately have opted fororiginal scripts with a satiric and political bent.   ``Carnage'' takes aim at fundamentalism in the United States,mocking such evangelists as Jimmy Swaggart and Jim and Tammy FayeBakker, as well as a public that can hero-worship Col. Oliver North.Although none of these people is mentioned by name, they are allimplicated in the play's absurdist brew.   The play opened to fine reviews in Los Angeles last yearfollowing a 1987 workshop, but critics in Edinburgh were divided.   Martin Hoyle in the Financial Times praised the ``cartoon-striprobustness'' of Robbins' direction, adding that it made a welcomechange from ``so much prissiness on the English stage.'' But CharlesOsborne in The Daily Telegraph said that ``its savagery is toothless... and the finale collapses into bathos.''   Robbins admitted that the production was still being fine-tuned,but said he expected conflicting reactions.   ``We try to produce plays that raise questions rather thanprovide answers,'' the boyish 30-year-old said between puffs of acigarette after a late-night performance.   ``I personally do not care for theater that is just purelyentertaining; I like to be challenged. I think that's more importantthan having a play that everyone smiles at, enjoys thoroughly andforgets the second they leave the theater.''   He said he and Simon, a 27-year-old graduate of HarvardUniversity, wrote ``Carnage'' to confront ``rapturism and thedangers of that, which no one in the press was talking about.''   Of wayward evangelists, Robbins said: ``I think it'sirresponsible to just write it off as these people being corruptfinancially or sexually, when they're indeed more corrupt in a muchmore insidious way.   ``For some reason, people within the media in the United Statesare afraid of Born Again Christians, as if they have some kind ofmajority _ as if the Moral Majority really was a majority,'' he said.   Robbins thinks he may get a rough ride from the New York critics,because he thinks they are biased against Los Angeles drama, andbecause ``political drama in America is really not encouraged. Youtry to say something, and unless you hit it spot on, people tear youapart.''   He has kept the Actors' Gang afloat with proceeds from hissupporting roles in movies such as ``Howard the Duck'' and ``TheSure Thing.'' But that is more difficult now that he has a4-month-old son by Susan Sarandon, his ``Bull Durham'' co-star.   In ``Bull Durham,'' the hit baseball movie of 1988, he played aklutzy pitcher opposite Kevin Costner. In ``Miss Firecracker,'' hewas the deranged, philosophizing cousin of Holly Hunter. He willnext be seen this fall in the title role of ``Erik the Viking,'' acomedy directed by Terry Jones, formerly of the Monty Python comedytroupe.   Co-starring John Cleese and Mickey Rooney and filmed in Britainlast winter, ``Erik'' is ``a very sweet story,'' Robbins said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Friday AMs, Sept. 15</NOTE></DOC>
