The EPA estimated the cost of the proposal at 1.8 cents to 2.3 cents a gallon, depending on the amount of fuel involved. An EPA official explained that refiners may decide to lower the sulfur on all diesel fuel, even that used in off-road vehicles.    Tougher particulate-matter standards are already being phased in for engine makers. But engine changes can't capture sulfate particulates, which are formed when sulfur is oxidized during combustion, according to the agency.    In addition to reducing particulate emissions, lowering the fuel's sulfur content also would help reduce acid rain, according to the EPA. This is because much of the sulfur that isn't emitted as particulate matter is released as sulfur dioxide. This, in turn, is further oxidized in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid and ammonium sulfates, which contribute to acid rain, the agency said.    Under the proposal, refiners would have to lower the sulfur content of diesel fuel to a maximum of 0.05% from current average levels of about 0.25%. In addition, the agency plans to cap at current levels certain other chemicals such as benzene that are known as aromatics.    Both requirements would take effect on Oct. 1, 1993.    The agency said the basis of the plan is a proposal submitted to the EPA last summer by a group of diesel-engine makers and petroleum refiners. Among other concerns, the engine makers worried that the sulfur in diesel fuel could damage equipment being installed on engines to meet the particulate-emission standards.    Also, the agency said the proposal conforms to a sulfur-reduction requirement recently approved in California.    The agency is soliciting comment on the proposed rule for 30 days. </TEXT></DOC>
