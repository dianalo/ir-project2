Pulliam at the aboveaddress (601/965-4900 or FTS 490-4900).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The Magazine Mountain shagreen (<T3>Mesodon magazinensis</T3>) is a dusky brown, or buff colored, medium-sizedsnail, approximately 13 millimeters (mm) (0.5 inches) wide and 7 mm (0.3inches) high. The rough shell surface is covered with half-moon, scale-likeprocesses that can be seen with a hand lens. The outer lip of the aperturehas a small triangular shaped tooth, the inner side has a blade-like tooth,and there is a small swelling on the basal lip near the center of the shell(Pilsbry and Ferriss 1906).The Magazine Mountain shagreen was originally described as a subspeciesof <T3>Polygyra edentatus</T3> (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1906). Pilsbry (1940)subsequently placed this snail into the genus <T3>Mesodon</T3> and elevated it to specific status. This species can beseparated from <T3>M. infectus</T3>, a similar but widespread species also found on MagazineMountain, by genitalia differences (Hubricht 1972) and a large maximumdiameter of 12.7-14.0 mm (0.50-0.55 inches) for the former and 8.3-13.8mm (0.33-0.54 inches) for the latter (R.S. Caldwell, Lincoln Memorial University,personal communication).This snail is known only from rock slides on the north slope of MagazineMountain in Logan County, Arkansas. A single dead specimen was found onthe south slope of Magazine Mountain in 1903 (Pilsbry and Ferriss 1906),but this population has not been verified since that time (Caldwell 1986).Preferred habitat is found on approximately 60 percent slope between 600meters (2,000 feet) and 790 meters (2,600 feet) elevation. Apparently thisspecies prefers cool moist conditions. Therefore, the species moves deeperinto the rock crevasses and becomes inaccessible for collection duringthe warm dry weather in July and August (Caldwell 1986). Because of itslimited range, this snail would be vulnerable to any land use change oractivities that would have an adverse effect on these rock slides. Thespecies' entire range is within the Ozark National Forest and is classifiedas a Special Interest Area. The Mountain is being considered as a candidatefor a Research Natural Area.On April 28, 1976, the Service published a proposed rule (41 FR 17742)to determine 32 species of snails as endangered or threatened, including<T3>Mesodon magazinensis</T3>. The 1978 amendments to the Act requiredthat all proposals over 2 years old be withdrawn if not finalized by November1979. On December 10, 1979, the Service published a notice (44 FR 70796)withdrawing the proposal of April 28, 1976.The Magazine Mountain middle-toothed snail (recently changed to MagazineMountain shagreen) was included as a category 2 species in a notice ofreview of invertebrate wildlife for listing as endangered or threatenedspecies on May 22, 1984 (49 FR 21664). Category 2 included taxa for whichinformation then in possession of the Service indicated that proposingto list the species was possibly appropriate, but for which available datawere not judged sufficient to support a proposed rule. In 1986, Dr. RonaldS. Caldwell completed a status survey on this species under contract tothe Arkansas Nongame Species Preservation Program. The U.S. Forest Service,the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission,the Arkansas Division of State Parks, and the Logan County government areall aware of the rarity of this snail and are supportive of the proposal.There is a local concern for the effect listing the snail would have onthe proposed development of a State Park on top of the Mountain. Certainly,the effect on the snail's habitat would have to be considered during anyfuture developments or land use changes. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the July 5, 1988, proposed rule (53 FR 25179) and associated notifications,all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices were published in the <T3>Southwest Times Record, </T3>Ft. Smith, Arkansas, on July 16, 1988,the <T3>Booneville Democrat, </T3>Booneville, Arkansas, on July 20, 1988, the<T3>Paris Express-Progress, </T3>Paris, Arkansas, on July 21, 1988, andthe <T3>Arkansas Gazette, </T3>Little Rock, Arkansas, on July 25, 1988, whichinvited general public comment. Comments were received from only threeparties, the Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission, the Arkansas NatureConservancy, and the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission, all in supportof the proposal. No public hearing was requested and none was held. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that the Magazine Mountain shagreen should beclassified as a threatened species. Procedures found at Section 4(a)(1)of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR Part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin Section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the MagazineMountain shagreen (<T3>Mesodon magazinensis</T3>) are as follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range. </T3>Because of the restricted range of the MagazineMountain shagreen, it is vulnerable to any land use change or activitythat would have an adverse effect on the rock slides where it is found.The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism has applied for a SpecialUse Permit from the Forest Service to develop a State Park on MagazineMountain. Any construction or recreational activities, such as buildings,roads, pipelines, or trails, could have an adverse effect on the snailif the rock slides on the north slope are disturbed. The U.S. Army wouldlike to use the National Forest in this area for training exercises. Ifany troop movements, vehicle movements, or artillery operations affectedthe north slope, they also could have a negative impact on the snail. Theseactivities, as well as forestry and recreational activities, representpotential threats, unless such activities are planned and conducted withthe protection of the north slope of Magazine Mountain in mind. The Servicehas contacted the U.S. Forest Service, the Arkansas Department of Parksand Tourism, and the U.S. Army regarding protection needs of the MagazineMountain shagreen. B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes. </T3>Although it is difficult to collect this species duringhot, dry periods, a knowledgeable collector could damage the populationduring a cool period following a rain. Therefore, collecting should becarefully controlled because of this species' rarity and limited range.C. <T3>Disease or predation. </T3>There are no known diseases or predatorsthat pose a significant threat to the snail. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3>Other than theSpecial Interest Area designation by the U.S. Forest Service, there areno regulations in effect that provide protection for this species. E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>The Magazine Mountain shagreen is a very rare snail, being found onlyon the north slope of Magazine Mountain where it is limited to rockslidesat the foot of the cliff. It occurs in small numbers and is dependent ona cool, moist microhabitat. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the Magazine Mountain shagreen as threatened.Since the species has a very restricted range, it is vulnerable to collectingand to any adverse habitat modification. Therefore, it seems appropriateto list the snail as threatened, defined as likely to become in dangerof extinction within the foreseeable future throughout all or a significantportion of its range. Critical habitat is not being designated for thereasons discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate critical habitat at thetime the species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Servicefinds that designation of critical habitat is not prudent for this speciesat this time. As discussed under Factor B in the ``Summary of Factors Affectingthe Species,'' uncontrolled collecting could be a problem. Publicationof critical habitat descriptions would make this species even more vulnerableand increase enforcement problems. In addition, the entire range is inthe Ozark National Forest and the U.S. Forest Service is aware of its presence.Protection of this species' habitat will also be addressed through therecovery process and through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. Thereforeit would not be prudent to determine critical habitat for the MagazineMountain shagreen at this time. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingand harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The only Federalactivities that may affect this species are any land use changes or activitiesadversely affecting the habitat, which is exclusively found on U.S. ForestService land. The U.S. Army is interested in the area for training exercises.However, the north slope could be excluded from this activity. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 and 17.31 setforth a series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to allthreatened wildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for anyperson subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to take, importor export, ship in interstate commerce in the course of a commercial activity,or sell or offer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listedspecies. It also is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport,or ship any such wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptionsapply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingthreatened wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22, 17.23, and 17.32. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. For threatened species, there are also permits for zoologicalexhibition, educational purposes, or special purposes consistent with thepurposes of the Act. In some instances, permits may be issued during aspecified period of time to relieve undue economic hardship that wouldbe suffered if such relief were not available. The Service will review this species to determine whether it should beconsidered for placement on the appendices of the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora and on the Annex ofthe Convention on Nature Protection and Wildlife Preservation in the WesternHemisphere. <ITAG tagnum="84"> National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">Caldwell, R.S. 1986.
