The ultimate test will be whether either side can muster enoughcohesion, military might and popular acceptance to impose its willon a nation that throughout history has resisted control by anycentral authority.   The U.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas have proved themselves adeptat defending their home turf in the countryside, but in a decade offighting they have yet to capture a major city.   Almost every night, one or more guerrilla rockets land in or nearKabul, but these attacks seem to constitute little more thanharassment _ not a battle for the capital, which is still defendedby Soviet soldiers.   A Western diplomat said last week that he believes the guerrillascould eventually triumph over the Soviet-style government, but onlyif they change their methods.   ``The only way you can unseat this Soviet client is through fifthcolumn tactics, psychological warfare,'' said the diplomat, who isnot American but declined to be identified further.   ``Millions are being spent on the mujahedeen (guerrillas), butthey're still walking around barefoot and in sneakers,'' he said.   A clandestine radio station, waging a battle for hearts andminds, would help, he said.   ``You could have four radio transmitters for the price of oneStinger'' _ the U.S.-made anti-aircraft missiles the mujahedeen, orholy warriors, have used to shoot down Soviet and Afghan aircraft.   But there is no evidence of such a shift in tactics. Instead, theguerrillas are pointing to their military triumphs.   Another Western diplomat said they have seized control of 19district towns since late April, when the Soviets began preparingfor the withdrawal of roughly 100,000 Red Army troops that began May15 and is to end by Feb. 15.   District towns are considered important because they areadministrative and military centers. All those taken by theguerrillas were defended by Afghan soldiers, not the Soviets, whosetroops entered Afghanistan in December 1979.   Most of the seized district towns are near the border withPakistan, where the guerrillas are based and get weapons provided bythe United States, China and other countries.   Although diplomats and other observers believe some of thecaptures of district towns were genuine military victories, otherscame about through tactical withdrawals.   President Najib has portrayed these retreats by his soldiers aspart of a deliberate plan to enable more than 3 million refugees toreturn home from Pakistan through a ``demilitarized zone.'' This maybe a face-saving device for the government, but also could be acalculated gamble.   If large numbers of Afghan women and children start crossing theborder, husbands and fathers who are now guerrillas will have tomake a choice: to carry their battle against the government intoterritory farther from home or to join their families, rebuild theirlives and start tilling the soil again.   ``Who's to say the mujahedeen won't think of better things to dothan to fight for Kabul?'' A foreign diplomat asked, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``Very, very few of them have fought outsidetheir home areas.''   The morale and loyalty of the Afghan army, whose strength isestimated at between 40,000 and 60,000 men and consists largely ofconscripts, has long been suspect.   But the government has other forces who are well-armed and bettermotivated. These include an estimated 25,000 to 35,000 ``sarandoy,''paramilitary troops with a decade of demonstrated loyalty to theregime, and KHAD, the secret police force that has its own tanks andarmor and is conservatively estimated at 10,000 men.   In the long run, the most important force may be the villagemilitias, who are currently on the government payroll.   Foreign diplomats estimate their strength at 65,000, the bulk ofthem in towns and villages around Kabul.   In Chahal Dokhtran, a village 20 miles south of Kabul that isfrequently on the government's tours for foreign journalists,militia commander Bari Mangal said he had 61 men to defend the 400residents.   The militiamen ranged in age from early teens to late 70s andcarried World War I vintage rifles, semi-automatic Kalashnikovs andThompson submachine guns.   Their politics, as translated by government officials, werefirmly pro-government and staunchly anti-mujahedeen. But their maininterest seemed to be keeping outsiders away from their fields andfortress-like mud brick houses.</TEXT></DOC>
