(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thieves have discovered there's bigvalue in bull semen, and a rash of burglaries has gotten so bad thatone dairy farmer says he may have to sleep with his semen tanks.   ``There is a bootleg market for semen,'' Marvin Jeglin, arepresentative of the American Breeders Service, said recently.   In recent weeks, a record number of dairies in San Bernardino andRiverside counties east and southeast of Los Angeles have beenraided by thieves who take tanks full of frozen bull semen, used byfarmers to impregnate cows.   Five dairies in the San Jacinto area, about 80 miles southeast ofLos Angeles, have been hit this month, Jeglin said.   The tanks themselves, which resemble Apollo space capsules butstand only three feet high, can sell for up to $900 each, said SanJacinto dairyman Vince Record, whose family has been hit twice inthe past six months.   Each tank can hold about 2,000 straws or tubes of semen worthanywhere from a few dollars to over $100 each, depending on thequality of the donor bull.   ``There are Secretariats in the cow world too, you know,'' Recordsaid, referring to the champion racehorse.   And like great racehorces, prize bulls supply semen that is noteasily replaced.   ``I had semen from bulls that've been dead 10 years,'' said ArieBreedyk whose dairy near San Jacinto was burglarized last week.   Police say they may have a difficult time cracking the case.   ``There's not any way of tracing these things,'' said RiversideCounty Sheriff's Detective Phil Sanchez. ``It's not like a VCR.''   The dairymen are taking a variety of precautions to guard againstfuture thefts.   Raymond Echeverria had already chained his tank to his garagewhen someone sliced through the combination lock with bolt cutterslast week.   ``I keep the tank inside the house now,'' he said. ``I'll sleepnext to them if I have to.''</TEXT></DOC>
