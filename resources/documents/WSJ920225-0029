Under 1990 amendments to the Clean Air Act, the EPA soonwill begin issuing utilities allowances that allow them toemit fixed quantities of sulfur dioxide, a pollutant thatcreates acid rain.</LP><TEXT>   Utilities will be allowed to buy and sell these allowanceslike commodities. For example, a company with low-gradesulfur dioxide emissions wouldn't need the governmentallowances and could make a profit by selling them to acompany that did.   The Clean Air Act amendments call for an annual publicauction and a cash market in the pollution allowances.Yesterday, the New York exchange -- commonly called NYMEX andbest-known for the large petroleum futures and optionscontracts traded there -- became the second futures market toapply to run these markets.   The Chicago Board of Trade has also submitted a proposalto the EPA and has applied for permission from the CommodityFutures Trading Commission to trade futures contracts basedon the allowances. Nymex hasn't applied to trade a futurescontract; a spokeswoman said the exchange sees development ofa futures contract as &quot;evolutionary.&quot;   The Nymex proposal contends that the exchange's experiencewith highly volatile energy markets would be an advantage inadministering the EPA allowance trading program.</TEXT></DOC>
