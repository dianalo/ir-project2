 And there are several ways of using ResEdit thathave nothing to do with programming.andP;  Here are three types of ResEdit tasksthat any user might find useful.andM;Trivial tweaks.andP;  Your friends may call them frivolous, but deep down they'llenvy your custom menus with rearranged, hierarchical menu items sportingbulletsandgt; spot colorandgt; and selective, tasteful underlining and boldfacing.andM;Interface refinements.andP;  Apple didn't do everything right.andP;  At least not foryou, your department, your company.andP;  You can refine the generic Mac interfaceto better serve your needs, with more-targeted dialog-box text, more-helpfulhelp.andM;Essential fixes.andP;  There are some changes you need to make for your softwareto perform properly.andP;  These aren't merely matters of cosmetic or convenience:When the time comes that you really need more than 13 files open at once, youshould know how to override this default limitation.andM;ResEdit knows about resources, and so should you.andP;  Every Mac program,including the System and the Finder, stores much of its functionality inresources, which you can examine and alter without having to rewrite andrecompile the program.andP;  Typefaces, icons, dialog boxes, menus, and cursorsare examples of what is stored in resources.andP;  This arrangement allows evennonpower users to modify programs and System software.andM;That's what ResEdit is for: It's a resource editor.andP;  Version 2.0 has some newfeatures, but more importantly, it has a new, more graphical interface and agood manual.andP;  The specific version current as I write this is 2.0b2, which isnot a final release, but this should not deter you.andP;  ResEdit spends most ofits life in the beta (testing) stage of development.andP;  Even the manual is betaor, as Apple puts it, a development document.andP;  Both work fineandgt; you shouldjust remember always to work on copies of your files.andM;A Few Trivial TweaksandM;Let's look closely at how you might use ResEdit to personalize your userinterface.andM;When you first invoke ResEdit, you see a goofy-looking jack-in-the-box headbobbing up and down.andP;  Let's say, for the sake of argument, that you like thispicture.andP;  Let's grab it and put it to use elsewhere.andM;Choose Open from the File menu, and choose ResEdit itself as the file toopen.andP;  (It is vastly wiser to work on a copy of any file you edit withResEdit, and this is even more important when you're editing System files orResEdit itself.andP;  We won't actually change anything in ResEdit, although it'sinteresting to note that ResEdit can edit itself.)andM;You now see a window full of icons.andP;  Scroll down to the PICT icon, whichrepresents all the PICT picture resources in the file.andP;  Double-click on it toopen it, and scroll through the individual PICT resources until you see thejack you like (there are several).andP;  Click once on it to select it, and chooseCopy from the Edit menu.andP;  Now close all the windows.andP;  You've got the pictureon the Clipboard.andM;Open another application (a copy of an application, that is), and make surethe application has a DLOG resource icon, because we're going to paste thepicture into a dialog box.andP;  Select Paste from the Edit menu.andP;  This pastes thePICT resource into the new applicationandgt; click on the PICT icon, and checkthat it's there.andP;  Also note its ID number.andM;You've copied the PICTandgt; now you need to tell the dialog box about it.andO;Double-click on the DLOG icon.andP;  This brings up a list of all the dialog boxesthis application presents.andP;  Double-click on one to open it, and you will seea miniature representation of the dialog box.andP;  Keep looking until you findone with some empty space into which you can paste the picture of thejack-in-the-box.andP;  (You can resize the picture, so don't worry about exactsize.)andP;  When you find a dialog box, double-click on it and then select CreateNew Dialog Item from the Resource menu.andP;  In the dialog box that pops up,select PICT.andP;  Type in the ID number you noted a paragraph ago, position andsize the picture by dragging its corner, close all windows, and quit.andO;Whenever you encounter this dialog box in this application in the future,you'll see it enhanced by the jack-in-the-box (see Figure 1).andM;Similarly, you can enhance menus by adding color, keyboard commandequivalents, or icons to individual menu items, and you can change their textstyle individually.andP;  If the application was written just right, you may evenbe able to rearrange the items in menus.andM;You can also change the default locations of windows.andP;  If you normally bootyour word processor and another application under MultiFinder, you can forcethe two applications to place their default document windows side by side.andM;I've already described how to change screen-layout settings by editing theFinder LAYO resource (see &quot;Windows of Opportunity,&quot; July '90, page 221).andP;  Youcan get a nice effect by toggling the Color Style setting in the LAYOresource.andM;And you can edit icons.andP;  System 7.0's new icon philosophy gives you a wholefamily of icons to play with, in various sizes and depths of color.andM;Interface RefinementsandM;But there's more to ResEditing than playing with colors and icons.andM;If you can't relate to the way the System displays the date, you can changeits INTL resources.andP;  The most obvious change is the order of elements inshort-date format: If you prefer D/M/Y to M/D/Y, you can have it.andP;  Just opena copy of the System file in ResEdit, select its itlO resource, and choose adate format.andM;As I mentioned last month, System 7.0 will have a nifty feature calledballoon help.andP;  Point at something when you're using balloon help, and a wordballoon pops up to explain what the thing is and what it does when you clickon it.andP;  Apple has done a good job of ballooning the Finder in System 7.0: Ifyou point at a grayed item on a menu, a balloon will tell you what it meansfor an item to be grayed, why this one is grayed, and what to do to ungrayit.andP;  Nevertheless, you might someday want to change these helpful helpmessages.andP;  It's easy, because the message text is stored in resources.andM;This suggests a theme for several other editing possibilities: A systemadministrator might want to customize various system messages for naive usersor for the particular on-line-documentation needs of a particular site.andO;Apple does a good job of localizing software for different countries andlanguages, but if, for instance, you're setting up Macs for English-languageuse in the U.S.andP;  by people whose native language is not English, youron-line-help needs may be peculiar.andP;  In general, you can speak youremployees' language better than Apple can, so you may want to customizewhatever language Apple has used.andM;You can even change the defaults for dialog boxes if you notice that Apple'sdefaults are not intuitive for your users.andM;Some Necessary FixesandM;But these are still optional measuresandgt; there may come a time when you have nooption -- when you really need to change a resource.andM;Just as you can change the default locations of windows, you can relocatealerts and dialog boxes.andP;  This isn't just a simple matter of interfacecosmetics or convenience.andP;  If you've ever been confronted with a dialog boxthat hides the very information you need in order to respond to it, you knowthis situation.andP;  Apple recently introduced nonmodal dialog boxes to solvethis problem in future software (that's a fancy way of saying that you willbe able to move the boxes out of the way).andP;  In the meantime, you can changethe default position of an application's dialog boxes only by editing itsDLOG resources.andM;You can also use ResEdit to edit fonts.andP;  PostScript (and soon, TrueType)fonts are another matter, but you can edit current bit-mapped screen fonts.andO;You want to be careful of copyright restrictions, but you can modify anexisting font to create your own special-purpose font.andP;  You may need to dothis if you have to squeeze a lot of information into a small space.andP;  You canalso build a picture in a word-processing document, using characters in acustom-designed picture font.andP;  To put a visible ruler into a document, createruler-tick characters in your own font and type the ruler in.andM;One of the more obscure resources is KCHR (see Figure 2).andP;  this resource hasnothing to do with fonts or typefaces but controls the mapping between thekeys on the keyboard and the characters of the Mac (ASCII) character set.andO;These ASCII characters are just abstract 8-bit data objectsandgt; they becomeparticular printable characters only when interpreted by a particular font.andM;What you might find a KCHR resource good for (where you'll find one is in theSystem file) is for creating new interpretations of modifier-keycombinations.andP;  The Shift, Caps Lock, Option, Command, and Control keys canall modify the action of any key pressed with them, and you can change themodification.andP;  This doesn't mean that you can set a modifier-key combinationto perform an action such as opening a fileandgt; you need a macro program forthat.andP;  All KCHR lets you do is associate a particular ASCII character with aparticular key combination -- but this can come in handy.andM;You can also use KCHR to decouple paired modifier keys on an extendedkeyboard so that the Option key on the right acts differently from the Optionkey on the left, for example.andP;  And you can create new dead keys, which donothing until they're pressed in combination with another key, usually addinga diacritical mark to the character.andP;  Or you can simply examine KCHR to seewhat dead keys are defined.andM;Note that editing resources is not the exclusive province of ResEdit.andP;  Thereare specific third-party editors for many of the most common resource types.andO;ResEdit is itself a collection of resource editors, including color pickersand bit-map editors.andM;You can get ResEdit and its manual from APDA/Apple Computer, 20525 MarianiAvenue, M/S 33-G, Cupertino, CA 95014andgt; (408) 562-3910.andP;  The reason ResEdit issold through APDA and lives most of its life in beta is because it isofficially a development tool.andP;  But far from being exclusively a programmers'program, ResEdit should be seen as a behavior-modification tool for Macs.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
