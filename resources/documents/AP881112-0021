The pre-dawn crash Friday was the seventh involving Americanmilitary aircraft in the Persian Gulf region, with a total of 12dead, durin 19 months of U.S. naval operations to protect commercialshipping caught in the Iraq-Iran war.   The overall U.S. casualty toll during that time is 49, including37 aboard the missile frigate USS Stark, mistakenly hit by Iraqimissiles in May 1987.   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said the SH-2Fanti-submarine helicopter crashed while making a routine landingapproach to the frigate USS Barbey.   ``They were coming in toward the ship, they called in and saidthey had some kind of a problem, and then the helo (helicopter) justwent down and hit the water,'' said one official.   The aircraft apparently sank immediately because boats and otherhelicopters from the Barbey, the aircraft carrier USS Nimitz and themissile cruiser USS California were unable to find any survivors orwreckage, the official said.   He said names of the crew were being withheld pendingnotificationof next of kin.   The three ships are part of the U.S. carrier battle group nowoperating in the Arabian Sea, in support of U.S. forces inside thegulf.   The investigation will be conducted by the headquarters of NavalAir Pacific at San Diego, where the Barbey and the helicoptersquadron are based.   In addition to the three presumed dead in Friday's crash, theoverall crash toll includes two U.S. Marine pilots killed when theirAH-1 Cobra helicopter gunship was lost, apparently due to hostileaction by Iran, last April 18 and five killed in two helicoptermishaps last year in the Persian Gulf.   The other two killed were pilots of a Navy carrier jet thatcrashed in the Arabian Sea during a training flight.</TEXT></DOC>
