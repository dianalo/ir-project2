The buzzword at the Futures Industry Association's national convention, which ended here Saturday, was &quot;globalization&quot; -- the idea of U.S. exchanges tying in more to world markets.    Apart from hand-wringing about Black Monday, U.S. executives at the 13th annual FIA session dwelled on international trading links, expanded hours and computer-screen trading -- all ways to encourage business with other time zones. The new focus will be many exchanges' best way to expand in coming years.    &quot;Commodities markets are world markets and have been for centuries,&quot; said Andrea Corcoran, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission's director of trading and markets. But there are some new logistic problems.    For example, should there be more coordination of international holidays in case big market swings happen in one country while another's exchanges are closed? Should banks now be available 24 hours a day to extend credit?    Also, some market experts said that as trading expands internationally, exchanges must prepare to open for emergency sessions on holidays.    Eric Bettelheim, a commodities lawyer in the London office of Rogers andamp; Wells, said the futures industry must decide &quot;whether we can force people to come to work even if it's the Fourth of July -- if doing so will avoid some of the repercussions we saw Oct. 19.&quot;    More than that, said Rosemary T. McFadden, president of the New York Mercantile Exchange, the U.S. banking system must in the future be available round-the-clock, if that's when the exchanges are trading. But disagreeing with that view was Roger D. Rutz, president of the Chicago Board of Trade's huge clearing operation. According to Mr. Rutz, exchanges &quot;have to take some of the risk&quot; of credit problems if it means competing internationally.    Another question: With 24-hour trading days, who decides what is the beginning and end of a day?    The CBOT, Mr. Rutz said, pondered the question for weeks before introducing its night trading session. It settled on treating night trading as the beginning of a day.    Such debates among U.S. exchanges amuse some overseas officials. They say they've always thought in terms of a world market.    Leslie V. Hosking, chief executive of the Sydney Futures Exchange in Australia, said American traders appear to have discovered only recently that they're not in a vacuum. &quot; 'International' doesn't just mean U.S. contracts are traded on other international exchanges,&quot; he added.    So provincial are many U.S. futures executives, it seems, that even cooperation within the U.S. takes some doing. At one panel discussion, Richard A. Heckinger, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange's vice president for international market development, reflected the classic Chicago view that commodities trading begins and ends in the Windy City.    &quot;We treat our New York office as a foreign office as well,&quot; he cracked.    Other news and notes from the FIA conference:   COMMODITIES KING: The FIA's board elected as new chairman David R. Ganis, president of Northern Futures Corp., Chicago, a unit of Northern Trust Corp. Mr. Ganis is the first FIA chairman from a bank-affiliated futures brokerage. But banks are the association's fastest-growing group in recent years. Mr. Ganis succeeds Jack H. Lehman III, a Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. executive.    ---   WORDSMITH WILLIAM SAFIRE of the New York Times, at FIA's opening breakfast, joked about George Bush, the Iran-Contra scandal and Michael Dukakis (he's &quot;a shorter Mondale&quot;). But he got his biggest laugh for a dictionary joke.    ---   ANOTHER JOKE. Wendy L. Gramm, in her first speech as CFTC chairman, explained that what happened on Black Monday was quite simple. She said &quot;prices fell in October because people -- a whole lot of people -- wanted to sell a whole lot of stock, 608 million shares, to be exact. They wanted to sell a lot of futures, too.&quot;    ---   COMPUTER-SCREEN trading is all the rage. Intex Holdings Ltd. -- a day before it disclosed that its International Futures Exchange in Bermuda is for sale -- announced a collaboration with Telerate Inc. to market a new computer-screen system. As previously reported, the Chicago Merc and Reuters Holdings PLC next year will launch Post Market Trade, or P-M-T, for electronic trading before and after the exchange's regular hours.    ---   BOCA BRIEFS: FIA officials were heartened that 1,100 executives, regulators and reporters turned out for the high-priced conference held at Boca Raton Hotel and Club, only about 100 fewer than last year despite post-Oct. 19 blues. . . CFTC Commissioner Fowler West blasted the Securities and Exchange Commission for dealing with Oct. 19 and other problems by &quot;pointing fingers at other agencies, particularly ours, and wanting to take over some of our jurisdiction.&quot;. . . Most talked-about promotional gift here was from New York's Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange, which gave everybody a small burlap sack containing coffee, sugar and chocolate samples. </TEXT></DOC>
