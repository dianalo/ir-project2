Miss McLellan, age 30, was arrested on March 31 in Harlem, for the attempted sale of 174 vials of crack. The former editor of the New York Times spotlighted her case in a column about commerce in drugs.    Miss McLellan's offense, a felony, could have landed her a one-year prison term. But Justice Silverman, after a plea bargain, let her off yesterday with probation. She won't spend a day in prison for her crime.    Like many other besieged cities in the U.S., New York is losing its war against drugs-not because its law-enforcement authorities are ineffective, but because the judicial system is failing to hold up its end. Indeed, of the 37,000 or so felony drug arrests in New York last year, only 14% led to sentences of a year or more.    Nearly a third of the city's felony drug offenders received no prison time. For those 51,000 New Yorkers convicted of misdemeanor drug charges, punishment was only slightly more severe than if they had received traffic citations.    Since the prospect of receiving stiff punishment is so remote, New York's drug sellers and users act with virtual impunity. But it is not that the extant drug penalities are too lenient, says Robert Strang, a spokesman for the federal Drug Enforcement Administration office in Manhattan. It's just that the full weight of the law is rarely brought against drug criminals. Mr. Strang argues that people arrested for sale or use of drugs &quot;should know they are going to spend time in jail. That's what's going to make the difference.&quot;    As it is, even the bit players in the drug trade -- those who conduct their business on the street level -- perceive that the law is toothless. When a person is captured with 174 vials of crack and walks away without doing any time, the threat of a prison sentence is no longer a deterrent. &quot;No matter what you're selling,&quot; says William Hopkins, supervisor of the street research unit of New York state's Division of Substance Abuse Services, &quot;you're back on the street. People say, 'Hey, it's worth the risk.'&quot;    Mr. Hopkins reports that an increasing number of drug &quot;crews,&quot; like the one Miss McLellan apparently belonged to, are infesting formerly drug-free neighborhoods in New York. &quot;We'll monitor the number of crews in an area over a six-week period and it will go from one or two crews to 20,&quot; Mr. Hopkins says. The usual crew consists of five to seven people. It might include, in ascending order of authority, a lookout, a hawker, a steerer, a runner, a &quot;security&quot; person, a stasher and a seller.    The lookout is usually a young kid, who watches for police and alerts fellow crew members if they are in danger of arrest. The hawker informs potential buyers of what drugs are offered for sale, and directs interested parties to the steerer. The steerer ascertains the quantity of drugs to be bought, and sends a message to the seller through the runner. The security person, usually armed and dangerous, oversees transport of the drugs to be sold from the stasher to the seller and protects the money. The stasher, often a woman and sometimes with a child in tow, hides the seller's cache of drugs. The seller physically deals the drugs to buyers and rides herd over the rest of the crew.    The police usually go after the crew members holding or selling the drugs -- the felony offenders. Crew members who facilitate the sale -- from the lookout to the runner -- are rarely pursued by the police, who don't want to waste their time on misdemeanor busts. When Miss McLellan was arrested, her steerer was also taken into custody. However, police later dropped the charges against the steerer, letting him get off scot-free.    There is much debate about how best to stem the drug trade in New York and other urban areas overrun by drugs. Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, for one, thinks interdiction is the answer. &quot;The amount of drugs coming into this country is beyond the capacity of law enforcement,&quot; he says. &quot;We need to cut down coca plants and poppy plants growing overseas.&quot; After all, he says, &quot;It doesn't grow in Central Park.&quot;    By contrast, Judge Burton Roberts of the State Supreme Court of the Bronx believes that New York's probation system bears much responsibility for the city's drug epidemic. &quot;The problem up to now has been that probation is somewhat meaningless,&quot; he said. Drug criminals are supposed to be regularly tested, to seek treatment, to pursue vocational training, and to seek gainful employment. But with probation officers checking on their charges only once every several months, many if not most drug probationers return to their illicit trade.    The obvious reason that the drug trade is flourishing in New York, as in other urban areas of the country, is that profits are high for sellers and risks are low for buyers. It stands to reason, then, that the way to curb the drug trade is to reduce the profit margin for sellers and greatly raise the risks for buyers. How do we do this? By redirecting the anti-drug effort to the demand side from the supply side.    A full frontal assault should be waged against the drug user. Those arrested for possession or use should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. A minimum sentence for those convicted on misdemeanor drug counts should be two or three days in local jail. No exception should be made for first-time offenders (the rationale being that the shock of jail will deter them from future use). Mandatory jail sentences on misdemeanor counts should become progressively stiffer with repeated offenses. Eventually, a message will be sent to users that anyone arrested for drugs -- no matter how small the quantity -- will serve at least a few days in jail.    Those convicted of drug felonies should receive a minimum prison term of one year, with no probation. It is inexcusable that only 14% of convicted drug felons in New York City received such a sentence last year. Those drug felons receiving parole after serving at least a year in prison should be monitored by parole officers more often than once every three months. Whatever increased spending goes into the parole system should be used to hire officers to check on drug parolees at least every two weeks.    Juveniles should not be exempt from punishment for drug crimes. If they are guilty of misdemeanors, they too should do some time in detention. Perhaps local jails might designate certain sections for youth offenders. The hardened juveniles found guilty of more serious felony drug offenses should be tried as adults. If kids are not dissuaded from the drug trade, they become even more incorrigible as adults.    As it is, &quot;younger and younger kids are getting involved in drugs because they are useful to dealers,&quot; says Rita Kramer, author of a recent book on juvenile justice, &quot;At a Tender Age.&quot; &quot;Every kid in Harlem knows what the law is,&quot; Miss Kramer adds. &quot;If they are under 16, they can't be touched. When they are caught, judges just release them.&quot;    Plea bargains such as the one that freed Miss McLellan are defended as the only way to clear a tremendous court backlog. Indeed, at least initially an expensive expansion of the justice system would be needed if all drug defendants were to be put on trial.    Another argument often made against tougher punishment of drug users is that prisons would be overtaxed. While that prospect is real, it might not be as bad as some within the justice system think. For one thing, the threat of incarceration will be a deterrent to drug use, thus many of those now using drugs with utter disdain for the law will rein in their habits. For another, the crackdown on drug use will bring in offenders who would have been arrested for other crimes anyway. Indeed, a Justice Department survey of state prisons revealed that nearly half of prisoners were under the influence of drugs when they committed their crimes.    Nonetheless, the number of federal and state prisons throughout the country would have to be increased. With a $71,000 cost per bed for a maximum-security prison, it would cost only $7.1 billion to increase total available prison space in the U.S. by 20%. Nearly three times that amount has been spent on the drug war since 1981 by the federal government alone. The price tag would be even lower for medium-security ($53,000 a bed) and minimum-security ($30,000 a bed) facilities. The money to build these prisons should come from the $6.5 billion a year Congress is expected to approve this term for the federal anti-drug fund. As it is now, 75% of these funds go to fighting the supply side. Additional funds for prison construction should come from the seized assets of drug offenders. Last year, for instance, the Drug Enforcement Administration seized $83 million in drug assets in New York state alone; more than $500 million nationwide.    If these funds are still insufficient to increase prison space, federal and state officials should turn to the private sector for assistance. Rather than the government asking the taxpayers to absorb the cost of additional construction, corrections entrepreneurs can arrange private financing in exchange for lease contracts or lease-purchasing agreements. At the very least, private corrections facilities could be used to house misdemeanor drug offenders.    By raising the risk of incarceration for both casual and hard-core users of drugs, we would greatly damp the demand for the illegal substances. By reducing demand, we would lower the profit margin for sellers, who would also face a &quot;higher cost of doing business&quot; in the form of prison time themselves. With lower profit margins in drugs, sellers may actually find legal commerce more lucrative. And with a smaller U.S. market to sell to, the international drug cartel would look elsewhere to peddle its deadly goods.    A drug dealer like Liviel McLellan should not be able to escape a prison sentence. Her probation makes a mockery of the judicial system and sends a signal to others dealing drugs in New York that crime pays. The way to put drug dealers like Miss McLellan out of business is to deprive them of their customers. This can be done only by putting users behind bars.    ---   Mr. Perkins is a Journal editorial writer.    ---           New York City Drug Felonies in 1987    Arrests                          36,757    Indictments                      18,659    Cases closed                     15,139    Convictions                      13,130    Incarcerations                   10,850    Sentences of one year or more     5,275   Source: N.Y.
