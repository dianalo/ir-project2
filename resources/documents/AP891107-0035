The United States, on the receiving end Monday of a long list ofJapanese complaints, was taking the offensive today, the windup ofa two-day round of new talks on lifestyle and other non-tradeproblems linked to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan.   U.S. officials planned to urge the Japanese to take such stepsas consuming more, building more sewers, ports and``super-express'' highways, and making it easier to convertfarmland into housing projects.   This was in addition to better-known U.S. complaints aboutantiquated distribution, noncompetitive pricing and corporatecollusion that the United States contends discriminates againstimports and penalizes Japanese consumers. The American side wasalso stressing that it wants to keep the U.S. investment marketopen to all countries but obstacles to investing in Japan make thisincreasingly difficult to defend.   The Japanese led off with their grievances Monday because theyaccorded that courtesy to the Americans when the talks started twomonths ago in Tokyo, and now they were the guests, said senior U.S.officials who briefed reporters Monday on condition of anonymity.   Despite strong complaints and obvious disagreement, Monday'stalk at the State Department was ``constructive and open,'' one ofthe U.S. sources said.   The new talks were announced by President Bush last May as aneffort to pinpoint non-trade causes contributing to the annual $50billion U.S. trade deficit with Japan. The two countries haveagreed to meet every two months, with a final report in mid-1990.   A U.S. official said Monday the ideal outcome would be emergenceof ``some new patterns of behavior in both our countries so that... the U.S. is much more competitive and so that on the Japaneseside their economy is much more open.''   The Japanese charged Monday that U.S. corporate behaviorweakened the U.S. economy and its competitiveness, both sides said.Japan pointed to Wall Street's leveraged buyouts as an example ofshort-term business strategy hurting U.S. interests.   Japanese officials also criticized low U.S. savings rates, lowinvestment in production facilities, research and development,slowness to convert to metric measure and underemphasis on exportpromotion and education and training of workers, the Japanesesource said.   Japan also accused the United States of wasteful use of energyand over-regulation by government in such areas as antitrustpractices, the ban against selling Alaskan oil to Japan, andrequired use of American-owned shipping, the source added.   The U.S. delegation was led by Richard McCormack, undersecretaryof state for economic affairs, Deputy Trade Representative LynnWilliams, Assistant Treasury Secretary Charles Dallara and CommerceUndersecretary Michael Farren.   Heading the Japanese delegation of more than 50 officials wereDeputy Foreign Minister Koji Watanabe, Deputy Finance MinisterMakoto Utsumi and Naomichi Suzuki, vice minister of internationaltrade and industry.</TEXT></DOC>
