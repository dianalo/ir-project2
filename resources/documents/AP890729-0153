The move, effective Monday, follows Chase Manhattan Bank, whichdropped its prime on July 10 by the same half percentage point. Thedecline was the second in as many months, bringing the prime rateto the level at which it stood at the start of 1989.   Analysts said they expected most other major banks to quicklylower their prime to the same level. Bank of America is thenation's second-largest bank.   ``They weren't the first and they won't be the last,'' saidstock analyst J. Richard Fredericks with Montgomery Securities inSan Francisco.   Bank of America chief economist John Oliver Wilson cited thefalling federal funds rate _ the rate banks charge each other forovernight loans _ and signs of a slowing economy as the mainreasons for the move, which was announced Friday.   The prime, a laggard among other interest rates, is a benchmarkbanks use to set interest on a variety of consumer and businesscredit, including home-equity lines of credit. It also determinesthe rate for many credit cards.   Wilson said the Federal Reserve Board has shown signs ofloosening its grip on the nation's money supply in reaction to acontinued slowdown in economic growth and an easing of inflation.   Analysts expected most major banks to follow Chase Manhattan'slead in lowering their prime rate once they were certain thefederal funds rate would remain near or below 9 percent, therebyconfirming the Federal Reserve's policy to depress interest rates.The rate was 815-16 percent late Friday.   Reflecting banks' continued dropping costs of funds, the averageyield on six-month certificates of deposit fell to a nationalaverage of 8.47 percent last week, compared with 8.52 percent theprevious week and the 8.8 percent range in late June, according tothe newsletter Bank Rate Monitor.   In the bond market, another indicator of general interest ratetrends, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond finished at about7.98 percent Friday, its first close below 8 percent since April 8,1987.   Wilson said the bank's second reason for lowering its prime wasthe week's economic news ``shows definitely that the economy isslowing down.''   A slowdown in the U.S. economy tends to ease the risk ofinflation, thus allowing the Fed to pursue a strategy of reducinginterest rates.   Wilson cited reports on Friday by the Commerce Department thatpersonal incomes rose a lackluster 0.3 percent in June as consumerspending _ which accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic activity_ declined for a second straight month. He also cited two months ofnegative growth in industrial production.   ``With this kind of interest rate and economic news across theboard, I'd expect the money center banks and big regional banks todo the same _ soon,'' said banking analyst Michael Abrahms ofBateman Eichler, Hill Richards Inc. in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
