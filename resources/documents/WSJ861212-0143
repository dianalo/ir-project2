He adds: &quot;We should have been mourning.&quot;    Four days later, the landlords, the Cohen brothers -- 61-year-old Sherman and 63-year-old Edward -- declared the lease invalid because Integrated hadn't installed a sprinkler system. As a result, Integrated's bank canceled financing for the deal.    Then the Cohens offered to drop the matter -- in exchange for $5.2 million. Integrated took the matter to a state court, alleging the Cohens' action was designed to impose &quot;economic duress.&quot; The judge agreed. But the Cohens threatened to appeal. Integrated had had enough of lawyers, courts and the Cohens: It settled with the brothers, agreeing to pay them $6 million over 15 years. After settling with the Cohens, Integrated secured financing and today retains the lease.    Lawsuits and the Cohens are almost synonymous on the New York real-estate scene. For the past decade, the brothers have been among New York's biggest and wealthiest real-estate tycoons. But lawyers and courts have figured into their climb to the top almost as much as brick and mortar. A combination of penny-pinching, sharpness and tough-mindedness has led the Cohens into dozens of disputes and lawsuits with tenants, brokers, contractors and others. The real-estate community admires them for their business skills. But when it comes to personalities, the word most often used to describe the brothers is &quot;difficult.&quot;    &quot;Our business is negotiating and striking deals,&quot; explains Sherman Cohen, the chairman and co-founder of Cohen Bros. Realty Corp., the family company. &quot;What do you expect us to be, boy scouts?&quot;    Whether as plaintiff or defendant, the Cohens have been able to extract concessions from battle-weary or financially weakened opponents. An examination by this newspaper of more than 20 cases over the past 10 years shows that, like many litigants, most Cohen Bros. opponents settle out of court, thus avoiding lengthy litigation.    A key part of the brothers' game is legal hardball at its fastest. On one recent occasion, they unsuccessfully tried to evict a holdout tenant from a development site by waging war on her potted geraniums. The Cohens alleged that the plants, which the woman says she kept in a window box for 20 years, created a &quot;dangerous condition&quot; (because they could fall and hurt someone) and a &quot;violation of a substantial obligation of {her} tenancy.&quot;    &quot;The Cohens are the ultimate example of business as war,&quot; says Peter Friedman, a commercial real-estate broker. &quot;They're innovative, self-made individuals who function in the real-estate business as if it were the Wild West.&quot;    &quot;They don't enjoy a wonderful reputation,&quot; says John Dowling, a top office-space broker at Cushman andamp; Wakefield Inc. &quot;If everyone in the real-estate industry made a list of their least favorite people, the Cohens would be right on top.&quot;    The Cohens, for their part, acknowledge that they have an image problem. But they brush off criticism. &quot;I don't spend my days concerning myself with what other people say about me; my banks love me,&quot; says Sherman. And if anyone else doesn't think likewise, he adds, it's because &quot;there's a certain amount of jealousy in this world.&quot;    Mr. Cohen asserts that he is no more litigious than other developers. &quot;I'd be happy if I never had to look a lawyer in the face again,&quot; he says.    That is not likely to happen soon. The Cohens still employ a squadron of attorneys for at least a half-dozen pending suits. &quot;When the Cohens believe in something, they fight to the death, even if they lose in every court,&quot; says Herbert Ortner, a Cohen Bros. lawyer.    That determination is what brought the Cohens relatively quick success in the real-estate business. Unlike most major New York developers, the Cohens constructed their empire from scratch. This year, Forbes magazine estimated the brothers' total net worth at $350 million, a figure Sherman dismisses as &quot;way too low&quot; and &quot;so out of line with what we're really worth it's ridiculous.&quot;    Beginning in the men's clothing business in their hometown of Newport News, Va., Sherman, Edward and their late brother, Mortimer, moved in 1949 to New York state, where they bought an Oldsmobile distributorship in Yonkers.    Business boomed and the brothers began dabbling in real estate in the 1950s. After their first project, an apartment building, was quickly rented, they sold the car business and snapped up sites. A prime target was Manhattan's Third Avenue, where real-estate values were soaring as the old elevated railway came down. They built, then sold apartment houses at substantial profit. In 1970, they completed their first Manhattan office tower and turned their energies to constructing more commercial properties.    From the earliest days, associates say, the brothers were close. Even now, Sherman and Edward have apartments in the same plush Fifth Avenue building and travel to work together in a blue stretch limousine.    Sporting tailor-made suits and lustrous silver hair, Sherman is clearly in charge. Sometimes he is gracious and soft-spoken, but in a flash his demeanor can turn and he will shout.    &quot;You're asking all the wrong questions,&quot; he scolded his son, Charles, 34, at a recent meeting with architects and engineers. Charles became the president of the family company in 1983. On another day, Sherman took a phone call, listened in silence for about a minute and then boomed: &quot;Tell them to go. I don't want them as a tenant.&quot;    Older brother Edward, vice chairman and overseer of construction, shouts more than Sherman, associates say. But his trademark is asking puzzling and impertinent questions during heated negotiations.    &quot;Eddy acts like a buffoon to catch people off guard,&quot; explains Arthur Morrison, a former attorney for the brothers. &quot;Really, he's very intelligent, and no decision is made without him.&quot;    Visitors to the Cohens' offices often catch the two brothers arguing with each other. Edward has been tagged &quot;Shut up Eddy&quot; by some in the industry because of frequent tongue lashings by his brother.    Some who have dealt with the Cohens speculate that the verbal sparring is intended to help the brothers gain the upper hand by distracting opponents during negotiations. &quot;They have a routine that might make some people dizzy,&quot; says Josef Mittlemann, a former Cohen Bros. vice president.    &quot;Maybe it is an act,&quot; Sherman admits.    Modesty about their considerable achievements isn't a quality the brothers possess. On one occasion, when an attorney wouldn't return his phone calls, Sherman left a message with the lawyer's secretary: &quot;Tell Mr. Fallon I have more money than he'll ever have, and I return my phone calls.&quot;    Some who have worked with the Cohens say they aren't eager to do it again. &quot;I wouldn't be likely to bring them another deal,&quot; says Mr. Friedman, the broker. &quot;After you've done a deal with the Cohen brothers, you start the second half of your job -- collecting your money.&quot; Mr. Friedman says he received half his commission in &quot;twice the time it should have taken.&quot; Edward Cohen says Cohen Bros. always pays in full, on time.    Some tenants also have had second thoughts. The Cohen brothers &quot;are the only landlords we've ever had problems with -- and we have offices in many cities throughout the state of New York,&quot; says Jerrold Ehrlich, an attorney for Empire Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shield.    A lawsuit the Cohens brought against the health-care concern has been pending in a New York state court since 1978. The Cohens allege Blue Cross owes up to $240,000 for electrical work. Blue Cross says it never authorized the work.    Says Sherman: &quot;It's painful to sue your own tenant. It's not something I relish.&quot;    Some Cohen projects have become legal shooting galleries for everyone from tenants to lenders. At the Crystal Pavilion, a glass and concrete office building on Third Avenue, almost every aspect of construction spawned lawsuits and ill will.    Crystal Pavilion &quot;had all the drama of the Carringtons and the Colbys&quot; on the &quot;Dynasty&quot; television show, says Mr. Mittlemann, the former Cohen Bros. vice president. &quot;If anything could go wrong, it did.&quot;    The Cohens had fully rented the building even before ground was broken in 1980. They anticipated receiving from the city a zoning variance that would have let them build to 35 stories, four more than ordinarily allowed. But the variance never came through.    Sherman Cohen says the city's decision was &quot;unprecedented,&quot; and he believes it was made because the city decided it no longer needed to encourage development on the East Side by granting bonus floors.    But some say the Cohens were a target for city officials eager to prove they weren't soft on developers. Unlike other Manhattan builders, &quot;the Cohen brothers hadn't paid their political dues and weren't well-liked by the real-estate community,&quot; says an attorney familiar with the city's position. &quot;The city wouldn't have done this to anyone else.&quot;    Faced with too many tenants for too little space, the brothers moved to wrest concessions from tenants. When Kenyon andamp; Eckhardt Inc., the largest tenant, refused to pay more rent for fewer floors, the Cohens moved to terminate the ad agency's lease. The Cohens then allocated some Kandamp;E space to other tenants. By early 1981, three different tenants claimed rights to a single floor.    That bred a long string of tenant lawsuits against the Cohens. The &quot;litigation explosion reached absurd heights,&quot; says an attorney for the Cohens. &quot;Every time you turned your head, there was another lawsuit.&quot;    The Cohens, who settled all the suits out of court, say they believe most of the litigation was inevitable, given the city's ruling. But some tenants disagree. &quot;In another building, the tenants would have joined hands and solved their problem,&quot; says a Kandamp;E official. &quot;Nobody wanted to do the Cohens any favors. We didn't trust them.&quot;    But while the Cohens' persistence in the courts has forced some of the nation's largest companies to settle, the brothers apparently have met their match in M. Jean Herman, the geranium lady.    The sixtyish Ms. Herman rents a tiny apartment in a dilapidated tenement on the mid-Manhattan site of the Cohen brothers' latest project, a 31-story office and retail complex due to be completed next year. For the past four years, the Cohens have tried to get her to move. Under the city's rent-control law, Ms. Herman doesn't have to leave.    &quot;She's just as stubborn&quot; as the Cohens, says Ms. Herman's former lawyer, Joseph Fallon.    Ms. Herman says her heat and hot water have been shut off periodically. She has turned down repeated monetary offers to leave. The offers, each higher than the previous one, are believed to have reached $750,000. Last February, Cohen Bros. bulldozed the back half of the building. Then it threatened to evict her on account of her geraniums.    Earlier this year, when nothing else seemed to work, the brothers sued her for more than $10 million, alleging she had harassed them and interfered with their efforts to build.    &quot;They have made my life a living hell,&quot; says Ms. Herman. &quot;Why should I move?&quot;    Sherman Cohen says he has stopped offering her money to leave. He adds with an air of resignation: &quot;We've spent close to $1 million to build around her. And that's what we're going to do.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
