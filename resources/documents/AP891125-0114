Several ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries said they wanted crude prices to go higher.   ``I would like to see them rise,'' Saudi Arabian Minister HishamNazer said at the start of the group's winter conference.   Iran's Gholamreza Aqazadeh said the cartel ``must get'' to itstarget price of $18 a barrel. A basket price of crudes monitored byOPEC recently hit $17.76 a barrel.   West Texas Intermediate, the American benchmark crude, has beentrading around $20 per barrel. Middle Eastern crudes run severaldollars less.   The petroleum ministers, who arrived in Vienna several days agofor informal talks, have as their goal a new production and pricingagreement for the first half of 1990.   OPEC's output ceiling now is 20.5 million barrels a day, butactual production is estimated at more than 23 million barrels.   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria told his colleagues themarket ``can easily absorb'' an average of at least 21 millionbarrels a day next year.   A stumbling block in arranging a production deal is demands byKuwait and the United Arab Emirates for bigger shares of thecartel's output.   Both have ignored the current accord and pump well over theirquotas. Their actions have angered other members who believe priceswould be higher with more restraint.   During private discussions Saudi Arabia has proposed that somecountries, like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, be allowed toproduce more.   ``I think it is a positive concept,'' said Kuwait's Ali Khalifaal-Sabah. Kuwait, according to analysts, is pumping close to 2million barrels a day, nearly double its quota.   The United Arab Emirates' Mana Saeed Otaiba declined to say whatquota he wanted. He said his country is producing ``more than 2''million barrels a day, or double its quota.</TEXT></DOC>
