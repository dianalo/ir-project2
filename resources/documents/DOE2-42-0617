The temperature of the sample is raised at a controlledrate and in a controlled atmosphere. The magnitude of the transmissionof light through the sample is detected as the temperature is raised.A data processor, differentiator and a two pen recorder provide a chartof the optical transmission versus temperature and the rate of changeof optical transmission versus temperature signatures (T and D) of thesample. These signatures provide information as to physical and chemicalprocesses and a variety of quantitative and qualitative information aboutthe sample. Additional information is obtained by repeating the run indifferent atmospheres and/or different rates or heating with other samplesof the same particulate material collected on other filters. 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
