Secondary market participation has recovered significantly since the near paralysis after the Oct. 19 stock market crash, but turnover still isn't back to normal.    New issue volume remains down sharply, and many participants already have written off the rest of this year. However, investment bankers expect 1988 to produce healthier bond markets.    Eurodollar bonds Friday ended the week slightly higher on short-covering ahead of the weekend and on a weaker New York stock market.    Prior to the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday, there may be a dollar-denominated or yen-denominated issue by Belgium equaling $400 million. Belgium plans to use the proceeds to pay off a floating-rate issue of that amount, but it has had some difficulty deciding on whether to come to market.    However, the prospect of the jumbo issue is discouraging other would-be borrowers who fear the market couldn't absorb two major issues in close succession.    &quot;There's a $400 million deal sitting there on the ledge, waiting to fall off. Nobody wants to think about anything else until that gets done,&quot; said a syndication specialist for a major U.S. investment firm.    The uncertainty surrounding last week's budget talks between the Reagan administration and Congress also severely hindered participation. The week ended with an agreement between President Ronald Reagan and budget negotiators on a two-year pact to trim the U.S. budget deficit by $75 billion.    For the week ended last Friday, underwriting volume totaled the equivalent of $756 million. For the same week of 1986, volume equaled $3.6 billion. Issuance is running nearly 40% below the 1986 total of $179 billion.    Eurobond traders said the decline in volume understates the health of many market sectors. In recent weeks, for example, large investors in Britain and the U.S. have actively sifted through seasoned issues, snapping up dollar paper trading at wide spreads to U.S. Treasurys.    Similarly, after a difficult summer, the Euroyen market finally is strong enough to accommodate new paper. Demand was good for last Friday's 20 billion yen ($148 million), five-year issue by the Mortgage Bank and Financial Administration Agency of Denmark. </TEXT></DOC>
