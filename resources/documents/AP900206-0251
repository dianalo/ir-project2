(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Eastman Kodak Co. on Tuesday announced aloss of $60 million for the final quarter of 1989, due mainly tothe costs of a restructuring the photographic company began earlierin the year.   The loss marked only the third time in Kodak's history that ithas reported red ink.   Company officials and industry analysts cautiously predictedimproved earnings in 1990 as Kodak begins to realize savings fromthe restructuring.   The loss, which amounted to 19 cents per share, compared withearnings of $312 million, or 96 cents per share, in the fourthquarter of 1988.   Sales for the fourth quarter totaled $4.89 billion, up 8 percentfrom $4.54 billion in the 1988 period.   Fourth-quarter earnings were reduced by restructuring charges of$322 million, or $525 million before taxes, bringing total chargesfor 1989 to $549 million, or $875 million before taxes.   As part of the restructuring, Kodak sold or consolidated about20 businesses and eliminated 7,500 jobs during 1989 in UnitedStates and abroad, most through voluntary separation, attrition andtransfers to other businesses.   Kodak's earnings for all of 1989 declined 62 percent to $529million, or $1.63 per share, compared with $1.40 billion, or $4.31per share, in 1988.   Sales for the year totaled $18.4 billion, up 8 percent from$17.93 billion in 1988.   ``Clearly, 1989 was a difficult year for Kodak, with significantexpenses related to our restructuring efforts as the most visiblesign,'' Kodak Chairman Colby H. Chandler said in a statement.   ``Earnings were further restrained by the impact of generalinflation on operating costs, higher interest expense and theunfavorable impact of exchange-rate fluctuations,'' he said.   All segments of the company reported increases in quarterly andannual sales. But information systems earnings dropped for both thequarter and the year even without the restructuring costs, andquarterly earnings from chemical sales also sagged.   Quarterly earnings in the health segment, which includesSterling Drug Inc., increased 15 percent without restructuringcosts, but dropped 9 percent for the year.   Without the restructuring costs, total Kodak quarterly earningswould have been $262 million, or 80 cents per share, down 16percent from last year, while annual earnings for the year wouldhave declined 23 percent to $1.08 billion, or $3.32 per share.   Mark Obenzinger, an industry analyst with Trinity Trading Co. ofNew York, said Kodak expects to save $450 million to $500 millionfrom the restructuring last year. Those savings should start toappear in mid-1990, he said, but the company will continue to facecompetitive and financial pressures.   ``They'll have to do even better than that in 1990 and set up amomentum that continues into 1991,'' Obenzinger said.   Analyst Brenda Landry of Morgan Stanley said she thought Kodakwould only manage to save about $350 million. Landry said she wasrevising her estimate for Kodak's 1990 earnings downward from $4.20per share to around $3.70 or $3.75.   Health care profits will be lower than anticipated and ``thechemical business we know will be falling apart,'' she said.   Chandler said he expects things to improve for Kodak in 1990.   ``We look forward to higher sales, better earnings fromoperations, and improved cash flows, especially in later quarterswhen the benefits of initiatives put into place are more fullyrealized,'' he said.   But Chandler warned that ``uncertainties in the U.S. economy,the down cycle in the chemical industry, and a softening in thedomestic market for office equipment ... could restrain somewhatthe gains which might otherwise have been achieved.''   The company has had a troubled decade, laying off thousands ofworkers in 1983, 1986 and 1989 in efforts to turn around saggingprofits.   The two previous losses recorded by Kodak also resulted fromspecial charges _ in 1985 when the company gave up its instantphotography business and in 1986 when more than 10,000 workers werelaid off in an earlier restructuring.</TEXT></DOC>
