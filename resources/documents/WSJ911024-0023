The loss estimate includes the cost of repairs to anadditional 4,500 damaged dwelling units, temporary livingexpenses for people left homeless, and the replacement ofpersonal belongings and hundreds of automobiles, says JamesWelsh, a claims consultant with American Insurance ServicesGroup.</LP><TEXT>   The figure is well below other unfounded estimates ofdamage that ranged as high as $5 billion. That astronomicalprojection was provided by Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris. Themayor's press secretary, who admitted she was unable tosubstantiate the figure, couldn't be reached for comment.   The most expensive disaster on record is Hurricane Hugo,which left a swath of destruction through North and SouthCarolina in 1989 and resulted in insured losses of $4.2billion, Mr. Welsh said.   Disasters prior to 1949, such as the 1906 San Franciscoearthquake and fire, and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871,would probably have cost more in today's dollars. But thelosses would have been borne not by insurers but byhomeowners, who typically didn't have fire insurance in thosedays.</TEXT></DOC>
