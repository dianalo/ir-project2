The Coalscan shaking tube system andpair production gauge significantly lightens the laboratory workloadby monitoring product ash and moisture. The accuracy of this information,produced from batch and continuous testing, is described along with adiscussion of the sources of error. In recent years it has become widelyaccepted that two important principles of yield maximisation within coalwashing operations are: 1. When coal is washed to a certain ash levelusing the practice of maintaining each circuit at an equal incrementalash, the recovery is automatically maximised. 2. If a constant (correct)S.G. of separation is maintained for as long as possible, the yield ismaximised. These principles can now be applied &quot;on-line&quot; within an automaticcontrol strategy using the ash monitor signal in a feed back loop toachieve the desired product ash levels. At Ulan Coal Mines preparationplant, this automatic ash control has been in routine operation sinceMarch, 1984, and is achieved by giving a computer the task of monitoringthe product ash levels and adjusting the set point of four dense mediumcircuits as required.</TEXT></DOC>
