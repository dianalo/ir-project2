Over a quarter-century Andrei D. Sakharov, 68, pursued hisvision of a just, less-brutal society, undaunted by Kremlinvilification, the scorn of his scientific peers and the KGB.   Before anybody but Sovietologists had heard of Mikhail S.Gorbachev, Sakharov demanded ``glasnost'' _ Gorbachev's policy ofopenness. Before Gorbachev's Kremlin declared a 19-month unilateralfreeze on nuclear testing, Sakharov publicly sought a halt to alltests.   Long before the Soviet leadership admitted Stalin's crimes tothe world, Sakharov was among those few who denounced them, and henoisily sought redress for the victims.   The Kremlin this year acknowledged its 1979 invasion ofAfghanistan was a mistake and even a crime, but Sakharov in 1980had denounced it, and he paid with nearly seven years of exile.   The stooped, rumpled physicist died Thursday, but the future heand other dissidents fought so hard for in the 1960s and '70s hasin part come true. For many Soviets, the man who spoke hisindependent mind in a stammering voice will be irreplacable.   ``We have lost our moral compass,'' mourned Roald Z. Sagdeyev,Sakharov's colleague at the Academy of Sciences and a fellow memberof the Congress of People's Deputies.   At the height of the dissident era in the 1970s, no cause seemedtoo small for Sakharov: Crimean Tatars, Soviet Jews and Germansseeking to emigrate, dissidents and religious activists all foundsuccor and sympathy in his two-room Moscow apartment.   While others kept silent in the oppression of the pre-Gorbachevera, this honored son of the Soviet regime spoke out againstinjustice and in favor of individual freedom. He risked hispersonal fortune, his liberty, his health.   The worldwide opprobrium his criticisms brought the Kremlin,plus outrage at his 1980 exile to Gorky and brutal treatment thereby the KGB, showed Soviet leaders they could not hope to be fullyaccepted members of the international community while stillrepressing their citizenry.   Sakharov's voice was only one of many raised in protest, but itcarried the farthest.   In December 1986, when Gorbachev telephoned him in Gorky to sayhe could return to Moscow, it proved the Kremlin, proclaiminggreater openness, was now ready to tolerate criticism it oncebranded anti-Soviet and even treasonous.   Many of the causes pursued by Sakharov and the dissidents of the1970s were won under Gorbachev, named Soviet leader in March 1985.There are now greater liberties of self-expression, freeremigration, successes in superpower disarmament, mass amnesties ofpolitical prisoners.   Soviet dissent, however, continues on other themes, frompro-independence political groups in the Baltics to the DemocraticUnion, a self-styled alternative party seeking a British-styleparliament. But none of their members has the domestic audience andinternational reach of Sakharov, and other anti-establishmentleaders, like maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin, are consideredby many to be demagogues or driven by ambition.   A developer of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who later recoiled inhorror at what he had wrought, Sakharov could have settled into acomfortable life back in Moscow with his wife, Yelena Bonner,continuing research on the physical properties of the universe. Hedid so for a while. But his conscience would not let him rest.   ``I personally respect Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev very much,but it is dangerous to give so much power even to the initiator ofperestroika,'' he declared this summer, after overcoming oppositionfrom the leadership of the Academy of Sciences to become one of itsrepresentatives in the new Congress.   With growing determination, Sakharov fought against theCommunist Party's constitutional monopoly on power. His status as adeputy meant that for the first time, tens of millions of Sovietsheard his views on state-run TV. He had spoken out previously aboutthe abuses of power; now he wanted to alter the very foundations ofpower.   It was to be his last, as yet unsuccessful fight. A nationwidestrike Sakharov called for Monday to force the Congress to enact amultiparty system flopped. Led by Gorbachev, the parliamentariansrejected debate on the issue 1,138 to 839.   After dinner Thursday, the Nobel Peace laureate left hisseventh-floor Moscow apartment for his book-strewn office one floorbelow. He was planning a speech to renew his attack on Article 6,the constitutional guarantee of Communist Party rule.   His parting words were, ``Tomorrow there will be a battle,''said son-in-law Yefrem Yankelevich. It was one of the rare battlesof his times that Sakharov would not take part in. He died alone,apparently of a heart attack.   Retiring on his laurels were not for Sakharov. In June, hetangled for the first time with Gorbachev at the Soviet Congressover breaking the Communist Party's legal grip on power.   Gorbachev tried to cut him off, but Sakharov kept speaking. ``Iwill continue,'' Sakharov declared from the podium. He did untilthe end.</TEXT></DOC>
