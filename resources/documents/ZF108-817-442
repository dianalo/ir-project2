I want thenames of all of them on my desk in the morning.andM;&quot;Hold the phone, Diane.andP;  Here's a most unusual one, created by DEC for theLend Lease Corp. in Sydney, Australia.andP;  Could this be an indication of aninternational expert system ring? The Project Early Design-stage IndicativeConstruction Time Estimate system  called PREDICTE-1 wonder why?) is designedto provide indicative construction time estimates of concrete-framed,multistory building projects at the concept or early design stages whenrelatively little project information is available.andP;  And get this Diane, it'swritten in VAX LISP.andM;Just one minute.andP;  The next IAAI application is also international-this timefrom Japan.andP;  This system, created by Hitachi and Okumura Corp. in Osaka, doespreliminary construction planning for the shield-tunneling method, a methodof excavation used in soft ground situations or high population densitysites.andP;  The application analyzes everything from ground water to soilsettling and makes a decision as to the optimal construction procedures.andO;Question, Diane, albeit a rhetorical one: why are construction applicationsso popular in countries outside the United States?andM;&quot;Boeing has a KEE application running on Apollo workstations called theProduct Knowledge Manager, which generates documentation for electronicproducts developed by Boeing.andP;  See, Diane, all documentation during the lifecycle of a product has to conform to Boeing's documentation standards, anarduous compliance task that would strain even my levels of patience.andP;  Italso takes 60 KEE knowledge bases to operate the program, so we're nottalking small potatoes here.andP;  As a matter of fact, we're not talking potatoesat all.andP;  However, a potato pie sure sounds good right now.andP;  I think I'll calldown for room service.andM;&quot;IBM created AudES, an expert system for auditing computer security.andP;  Thesystem, written in IBM's now defunct ESE program, can audit intrusions to thesystems and do risk analysis for setting up security procedures for aspecific computer operation.andM;&quot;Getting into some really esoteric applications, Eaton has been saving atleast $100,000 annually with a combined expert system/ neural net forbalancing brakes on its fleet of trucks.andP;  Using KEE and HNC's Anza Plusdevelopment board, the company created a system that analyzes diagnostic datafrom brake-testing equipment.andP;  And since we're talking about the rubberhitting the road, the Directorate of Roads in France has created ERASME, asystem for evaluating the needed repair and maintenance of paved highways.andO;The typical maintenance manager oversees 3,000 kms of road but can addressonly 300 kms per year.andP;  This system was written using the SMECI shell and hasalready been used on 300 sites.andM;&quot;A few other applications worth noting at the conference covering knowledgetools for increased software efficiency and PLC programming, but I can't getto them now, Diane.andP;  Someone's at the door.andP;  Must be room service.andP;  I'll beright back.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
