GarciaStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/12/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK INDEXES (NDX)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR)STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK) </IN><TEXT>   Traders are bracing for widespread confusion and a bumpy ride in the stock and futures markets next Friday when futures and options contracts expire.    For the first time, settlement of certain stock-index futures and options contracts will move to the start of New York Stock Exchange trading; others will remain at Friday's close.    The two-part expiration is supposed to quell the stock market volatility usually sparked by the triple-witching hour, the simultaneous, quarterly expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks.    But some traders fear that the new approach, which they have dubbed the &quot;double triple-witching hour,&quot; could make a usually chaotic trading period even worse.    &quot;There will be confusion for traders with positions, as well as for all the world that will be watching,&quot; says Robert Gordon, president of Twenty-First Securities Corp.    The stock market's opening, normally a volatile time because buy and sell orders have piled up since the previous close, may be even more tumultuous Friday, according to critics of the new system. Some stocks may be delayed in opening as Big Board specialists wade through the flood of orders.    Huge order imbalances and price swings, often seen at the close on expiration Fridays, &quot;might be seen next Thursday afternoon as well,&quot; says James A. Jacobson, a partner in the specialist firm of Benjamin Jacobson andamp; Sons.    But some say volatility will be less than expected as traders try to make the revamped system work to forestall pressures for a regulatory solution.    David Shields, a floor broker with Shields andamp; Co., believes &quot;the potential for games playing&quot; could be reduced by separating the end of trading from the settlement procedure and encouraging brokers to disclose any buy and sell orders that must be processed at the opening. When both contracts and stocks traded until the final bell, he said, some firms could delay until the last minute orders that could influence prices. With the new procedure, &quot;There will be more sunshine on these order imbalances, and it gives a lot more people a chance to react.&quot;    Moving some settlements to the opening will take advantage of Big Board systems that sort orders before the market opens. The Big Board hopes that by expanding these order-processing systems it can avoid the last-minute order crush that has sent stock prices skidding or soaring at previous quarterly expirations in the past 2 1/2 years.    On Dec. 19, for example, 86 million shares traded in the final minute before expiration, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average 16 points higher. On March 20, about 54 million shares traded at the close as the industrials soared 34 points.    Widely watched will be the move to Friday's opening of the popular Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract, which is traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The Chicago Merc agreed to the change in December but couldn't implement it in time for the March 20 expiration.    Meanwhile, the Chicago Board Options Exchange is keeping at Friday's close the expiration of the Sandamp;P 100 stock-index options. The exchange wanted to avoid &quot;possible manipulation&quot; of option prices between Thursday's close -- when the options stop trading -- and Friday's opening stock prices on which option settlement prices are based, says Michael J. Razar, a Chicago Board Options Exchange governor and trader.    The CBOE also is keeping the Sandamp;P 100 option expiration at the close, he says, because it's traded mainly by individuals, who might be upset by a change. But to satisfy the largely institutional users of the Sandamp;P 500-stock index, the CBOE added a second options contract that will expire at Friday's opening.    The exchanges aren't willing to predict unqualified success for the new approach.    While Big Board officials and specialists hope that finding buyers or sellers for the huge blocks of stock will be less hectic at the opening than with a deadline looming at the close, they aren't sure if volatility will be reduced.    &quot;We wanted the broadest number possible of investors to participate in the pricing decision&quot; at the opening, says Richard Grasso, Big Board executive vice president. &quot;The volatility factor is anyone's guess.&quot;    The latest tactics aren't carved in stone, exchange officials note. William Brodsky, president of the Chicago Merc, says, &quot;The June expiration may not mark an end to the changes. This is an ongoing process.&quot;    &quot;I suspect the problem will never be solved,&quot; says Susan Phillips, the outgoing chairwoman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. &quot;We'll always be dealing with a new level of problems.&quot;     ---              Triple-Witching, Thrice Confused                                    Trading   Settlement Underlying Index    Exchange       Ends      Basis*  Sandamp;P 500 Index  Futures            Chicago                     Merchantile    Thursday  Friday Opening  Options on futures Chicago                     Merchantile    Thursday  Friday Opening  Options (new)      Chicago                     Board Options  Thursday  Friday Opening  Options (old**)    Chicago                     Board Options  Friday    Friday Close  Sandamp;P 100 Index  Options            Chicago                     Board Options  Friday    Friday Close  Major Market Index  Futures            Chicago                     Board of Trade Friday    Friday Close  Options            American                     Stock Exchange Friday    Friday Close  NYSE Composite Index  Futures (new)      N.Y.
