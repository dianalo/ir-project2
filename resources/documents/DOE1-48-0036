<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-48-0036 </DOCNO><TEXT>A sensitive and specific ELISA method was used to determine changes inthe serum DNA concentration in rats at hours 6 and 9 and on the days1, 3, 7, 10, 15 and 30 after acute whole-body gamma irradiation witha dose of 8 Gy. Changes in the DNA serum concentration were determinedalso on day 10 after irradiation with doses of 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 Gy.The present results indicate that the pattern of changes in the serumDNA concentration is characterized by an initial decrease, typical alsoof the leukocyte count, followed by a statistically significant increasein the DNA concentration on day 10 and in later periods of time. Thesedata confirmed, in principle, the authors' previous findings on changesin the DNA concentration in the rat blood plasma after acute X-ray irradiationassessed by the fluorimetric method with ethidium bromide.
