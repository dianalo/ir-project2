The issue so divided the committee that members submitted tworeports to the council.;    The &quot;neighborhood&quot; report declared the site wasinappropriate for additional elderly-housing or any development that increaseddensity in the area. It also questioned the need for elderly-housing inSaratoga and maintained that there were more viable sites in the city,including the Masson site.;    The other report, representing the views of theSaratoga Avenue Senior Citizens Coordinating Council and officials from Rogersand Brooks Inc., developers of the San Marcos project, said a privately ownedlife care retirement center is needed in Saratoga. The report said that theOdd Fellows site was the preferred location because of its proximity to theOdd Fellows facility and because it provided a more tranquil setting, free ofair quality problems.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MICHAEL CRONK, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910607  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  253  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday June 7, 199100159192,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
