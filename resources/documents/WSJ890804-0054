The selloff reflected a continuing easing of tension over the temporary shortage of soybeans earlier this summer. While soybeans from the bumper harvest in Brazil, the world's No. 2 producer after the U.S., have been slow in flowing into world markets this year because of the political and financial turmoil there, Brazilian exports have begun burying world prices.    Prices for August delivery on the Chicago Board of Trade have tumbled 10% in the past week as a result. The unusually wide price premium of soybeans for August delivery compared with beans for delivery in November, after the U.S. harvest, has plunged by more than two-thirds.    The weather is likely to be nearly ideal for the U.S. soybean crop in the next couple of weeks, many meteorologists say, with moderate temperatures punctuated by showers across the Farm Belt. &quot;Everybody agrees with the weather forecast, and prices have a tendency to just slide,&quot; said Walter Spilka, analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., New York. &quot;The crops should continue to do real well, given that scenario.&quot; U.S. farmers anticipating a big harvest have stepped up soybean sales as well.    The selloff in the bean pit dragged corn and wheat futures lower in thin trading, amid apprehension about a major government crop report set for release next week Thursday.    &quot;It looks like a bottomless pit, which is probably an indication that one should cover shorts,&quot; or buy contracts to take profits on selling positions, said Katharina Zimmer, analyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., New York.    A private crop estimate by an influential commodities concern, Sparks Commodities Inc. of Memphis, Tenn., could spur some buying in corn futures when the market opens today. Sparks predicted a corn crop of 7.349 billion bushels, traders said. A Sparks official declined to comment. While that would be an increase of 49% from last year's drought-damaged harvest, it nevertheless falls short of the levels many traders believe are reflected in current futures prices.    &quot;It's lower than traders are thinking,&quot; said Robert Lekberg, analyst with Farmers Grain andamp; Livestock Corp., Chicago. Current prices would reflect a harvest of about 7.7 billion to 7.8 billion bushels, some analysts estimated.    But Mr. Lekberg said the Sparks estimates &quot;sound very fair to me,&quot; based upon the number of acres farmers planted last spring and upon the Aug. 1 timing of the Sparks survey, which was conducted before recent rains improved conditions. Sparks also told clients it expects soybean production of 1.934 billion bushels, which would be a 26% increase from last year's level.    Separately, Ferruzzi Finanziaria S.p.A. dropped its lawsuit seeking to block the Chicago Board of Trade's emergency order forcing liquidation by traders in July soybean futures. The exchange issued the order after Ferruzzi's accumulation of large holdings on cash and futures markets threatened to force prices sharply higher.    But the big Italian merchant and processor said it still plans to sue the Board of Trade for damages for losses incurred as a result of the July 11 order.    In other commodity markets yesterday:    ENERGY: Oil markets ignored reports of continued high OPEC production to focus on the political situation in Lebanon. &quot;A lot of people are trading on Middle East news,&quot; one trader said. As a result, petroleum futures were relatively firm much of the day. But then there was a late-day selloff on the New York Mercantile Exchange after an apparent easing of the tension in the hostage crisis. After the report that a pro-Iranian Moslem group in Lebanon had &quot;suspended&quot; the threatened execution of a U.S. hostage, West Texas Intermediate crude for September delivery, which had reached a high of $18.50 a barrel during the day, settled at $18.21, down eight cents. The October crude contract was down 17 cents a barrel to settle at $17.91. There was little market reaction, meanwhile, to the monthly report of the International Energy Agency, which estimated July crude-oil production by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries at 21.3 million barrels a day, the same rate as that estimated in June.    COPPER: The September futures contract gave up some of its recent gains, and prices for other months were narrowly mixed. The September contract declined 0.45 cent a pound to $1.1265. September copper has been running at a premium to the December contract -- on Wednesday it was four cents a pound higher -- which reflects an increasing tightness of supplies. At the beginning of trading, warehouses of New York's Commodity Exchange held 18,894 tons of copper, down 1,025 tons from Wednesday. But at the same time, one analyst said, the possibility of an end to the strike at Highland Valley Mines in British Columbia, a major Canadian copper producer, seemed to weigh on the September contract, narrowing its premium over December to 3.4 cents a pound. The analyst said mediation has trimmed the number of issues outstanding in the Highland Valley negotiations to 10 from the 60 originally on the table. Some of the remaining issues are &quot;quite sticky,&quot; he said, and the dispute is far from settled, but &quot;there is increased hope that it will be, in a reasonable amount of time.&quot; The improved situation at Highland Valley follows reports on Wednesday from Papua New Guinea that another major producer, Bougainville, might resume operation by the end of this month or early September after being shut down since May 15.    PRECIOUS METALS: Futures prices ended higher despite some late selling. Gold for August delivery was up $3.60 an ounce at $373.70, while September silver gained seven cents an ounce to $5.333. October platinum rose $3.40 to $506.50. Continued tension over the hostage situation in the Middle East was the principal market-supporting influence, according to one analyst. Precious-metals traders ignored a higher dollar, he said, creating an unusual situation in which a &quot;flight to safety&quot; was working, at the same time, for the dollar and for precious metals. Demand for precious-metals contracts was triggered in the early afternoon by a report that U.S. warships were moving closer to Iran and a rumor that a second U.S. hostage in Lebanon had been killed, the analyst said. Toward the end of the session, selling caused prices to ease from their highs. Just about at the close, the analyst said, and too late for the market to react, there was news that the group holding the hostage had suspended its death threat. Another analyst, Bernard Savaiko of PaineWebber Inc., New York, said the hostage situation might ultimately have differing effects on gold and the dollar. &quot;The rise in gold has come solely from the tension in the Middle East, and when it abates, gold is likely to decline,&quot; he said. &quot;On the other hand, the strong stand against terrorism by President Bush might be constructive for the dollar because it would enhance its 'flight-to-safety' allure,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
