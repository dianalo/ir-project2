More than 70 percent of the 10.4 million voters in Thursday'sballoting voted for the constitutional change, according to resultsannounced today by the Interior Ministry.   The constitution extends the process of political and socialreform that President Chadli Bendjedid promised after a week ofriots last October left 176 people dead by official count.Government offices were the main targets of rioters.   About 80 percent of the 13 million voters in this former Frenchcolony in North Africa cast ballots, the ministry said.   Interior Minister Aboubakr Belkaid said the new constitution``opens the way to a new era.'' He said it will allow his country``to know more democracy, to assure public and individual liberties,and to establish the sovereignty of the law.''   Although it does not specifically authorize political parties tocompete with the ruling National Liberation Front in this nation of25 million, the new constitution declares ``the right to createassociations of a political character.''   Since Bendjedid, 59, announced the draft constitution, variousgroups have begun forming. Among them are the leftist DemocraticUnion, the Islamic Salute Front and the Berber's Rally for Cultureand Democracy.   Ahmed Mahsas, a former agricultural minister, announced formationof the Union of Democratic Forces on Thursday, the official AlgerianPress Service reported.   It was the third national referendum in less than four months.   In November, 92 percent of the voters approved political reformsthat began reducing the power of the ruling party, Algeria's onlylegal political organization. The next month, about 81 percentelected Bendjedid to a third five-year term.   October's riots were rooted in economic problems brought by lowworld prices for oil, the nation's chief export. Many Algeriansblamed the centralized, socialist government for failing to solvethe problems.   The proposed constitution also guarantees freedom of expressionand, within limits, the right to strike. It would restrict the armyto defending the ``national independence, the unity and territorialintegrity of the country.''   Under the current charter, the army has a role in ``developmentof the country and the building of socialism.''   Also dropped is a declaration that ``the Algerian state issocialist.'' The new text does not refer to socialism.   However, Islam would remain the state religion and Arabic theofficial language.</TEXT></DOC>
