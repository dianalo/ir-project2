The contract between Midland Cogeneration Venture and Fluor Daniel, a unit of Fluor, has a ceiling of $468.9 million and includes the purchase of all equipment for the project. The venture plans to redesign a portion of Consumers Power's mothballed Midland nuclear power plant, located in Midland, Mich., to operate as a gas-fired cogeneration facility.    Jackson, Mich.-based Consumers Power said the contracted cost of the conversion is less than it had originally estimated and added that it is &quot;confident&quot; that the project &quot;will be built at or below the contract cost.&quot; The utility also said Fluor will join the venture as an equity partner by investing $25 million in the project. Consumers said more equity partners will be announced in the next few weeks.    Consumers Power had said that in addition to equipment already lying idle at the site that will be used in the conversion, a total of $600 million would be needed to build the new plant. However, the utility has now scaled that figure back to $540 million. Consumers Power has a 49% stake in the joint venture and Dow has a 10% position. Fluor's investment will give it a 3% stake and the remaining 38% will be divided among future equity partners.    Cogeneration plants produce both steam and electricity and are usually owned by businesses that use a portion of the power themselves and sell the rest to local utilities.    Consumers Power announced plans to convert the Midland plant to fossil fuel after the company ran up huge cost overruns and finally abandoned efforts to complete the nuclear facility. In 1985, the utility had to seek an emergency rate increase to avoid bankruptcy.    Dow Chemical, also located in Midland, Mich., became involved in the conversion project partly because it needs steam and electricity for its Midland operations. It was also entangled with Consumers Power in expensive lawsuits over Dow's cancellation of an earlier contract to buy steam from the nuclear plant. The two companies dropped the litigation when they formed the joint venture. </TEXT></DOC>
