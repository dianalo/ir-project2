The four snags cited by Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd,D-W.Va., include a U.S.-Soviet disagreement about the meaning ofprovisions designed to assure the United States against Sovietcheating.   He and the other leaders say they are optimistic all thedifficulties will be resolved, but they have firmly declared theiropposition to rushing the ratification proceedings just so the workwill be finished by the May 29-June 2 summit.   ``This is not a delay,'' said Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of theSenate Armed Services Committee. ``This is an effort to do thisthoroughly.''   Since last December, when the superpowers signed the pacteliminating ground-based missiles with ranges between 315 and 3,125miles, Reagan has hailed the verification and monitoring provisionsas unprecedented sets of safeguards against Soviet non-compliance.   Having steered the pact through committee hearings, theadministration is now eager for approval by the whole Senate intime for a formal exchange of ratification documents between Reaganand Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev at the summit.   Byrd told a news conference on Friday he would open the Senatedebate on May 11, if the four obstacles are overcome. Joining Byrdand Nunn in the decision were the chairmen of two other importantSenate committees: Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., of Foreign Relations andDavid L. Boren, D-Okla., of the Select Committee on Intelligence,who called the stumbling blocks ``important loose ends.''   The newest of the four problems identified by Byrd is adisagreement between the United States and the Soviet Union overthe things inspectors of missile facilities will be permitted tosee and where they may go to see them.   According to the State Department, Soviet experts believe thetreaty permits inspection of weapons containers big enough tocontain entire missiles. They also want to put off-limits someareas of three of their 133 facilities covered by the agreement.   The United States says the treaty permits inspection of smallercontainers as well, to see if they contain individual missilestages, and does not permit the Soviets to place the selected areasoff limits.   State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman said higher levelofficials had become involved in the dispute, which originally wasraised on a technical level, and he said he was optimistic theproblems would be resolved.   Nunn said: ``I believe the problems can be reconciled but Ibelieve the Soviets should understand this is not a good way tostart out by challenging some clear provisions of the treaty.   ``It is enormously important that we go into this treaty withgood faith on both sides. We do not need any cloud of bad faithhanging over us.''   The second snag, the senators said, was the need to getclarification from the Soviets, in writing, that the ban onintermediate range-missiles now in the superpower arsenal willprevent both sides from developing futuristic versions of theseweapons.   In settling this dispute, the two countries would presumablyneed to define more precisely what is, in fact, a ``weaponsdelivery system.'' The fear is that arms builders could devise aweapon they do not define as a missile but has the capabilitiesthat today's missiles have.   Third, the senators are seeking assurances that the UnitedStates has the capability to verify the ban on futuristic weapons.And finally, they want a commitment from the administration that itis moving adequately and with enough money to upgrade satellitesurveillance systems that help monitor the accord.   ``If these differences can be resolved, I don't see any reasonwhy we can't approve ratification,'' Byrd said.</TEXT></DOC>
