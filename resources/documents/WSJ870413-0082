YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)CONGRESS (CNG)TREASURY DEPARTMENT (TRE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some of the popular American Eagle gold coins sold by the U.S. Mint between October and February were slightly underweight.    Some of the coins may be as much as 1% below their nominal weight, according to aides to Rep. Frank Annunzio (D., Ill.), chairman of the House Banking Subcommittee on Consumer Affairs and Coinage. The short-weighting came about because the Mint allowed for some variance in the weight of blank gold coins it purchased to strike the series, Mint officials said.    Rep. Annunzio said he was &quot;horrified that the U.S. government could be involved in shortchanging so many unsuspecting customers of a popular product.&quot;    Mint Director Donna Pope called Rep. Annunzio's comments &quot;an irresponsible distortion of the truth. . . . He is needlessly alarming the American public.&quot;    The coins in the American Eagle gold bullion series are sold in four sizes: one ounce, half-ounce, quarter-ounce and tenth-ounce. Their prices are based upon the spot-market price for gold.    The Mint buys blank coins from two suppliers and then strikes them with the series logo. For the one-ounce coins, the Mint specifies that the blank coins must contain at least an ounce of gold. Until early this year, however, it allowed variations for the smaller coins. A half-ounce coin, for example, could have weighed anywhere between 0.4975 ounce to 0.5025 ounce, according to Mint officials.    Based on Friday afternoon's London price of $431.60 an ounce, that would mean that the purchaser of a half-ounce coin could have been shortchanged as much as $1.08.    The range was allowed because traditionally one-ounce bullion has been bought by serious investors and the smaller coins have been purchased for jewelry or keepsakes or as collectibles, according to Mrs. Pope. &quot;We have produced coins with similar tolerances over the years,&quot; she said. &quot;Such a small tolerance should have no impact on the value of the (smaller) coins.&quot;    The Mint revised its specifications after receiving inquiries from dealers in Europe and the Far East about underweight coins, Mrs. Pope said. &quot;We began sensing that people might be buying (the smaller) coins as investment pieces,&quot; she said. Now all coins must contain at least their nominal weight in gold.    Some variance is considered normal in smaller weights of most gold coins, including the Canadian Maple Leaf and the South African Krugerrand, according to coin dealers.    Since the American Eagle coins were introduced in October, more than 4.1 million coins -- nominally representing more than 70 tons of gold -- have been sold, making it the most popular gold coin in the world. They are the first non-commemorative gold coins to be produced by the Mint since President Roosevelt took the U.S. off the gold standard in 1933.    More than 2.5 million of the coins sold were half-ounce or smaller, and Rep. Annunzio estimates that about half of those are underweight. He said he wants the Mint to replace them.    A spokesman said the Mint will replace coins that are outside the tolerance but couldn't say whether coins within the tolerance but less than nominal weight would be replaced. </TEXT></DOC>
