Results of the double contrast wrist arthrogramswere essential to the diagnosis, confirmed the diagnosis, or salvagedan otherwise poor or nondiagnostic examination. It was found that intra-articularinjection of air augments the information obtained during postarthrogramactive motion studies under fluoroscopy. Double contrast wrist arthrographyhas proved valuable when the standard contrast arthrogram fails to yielddiagnostic information.</TEXT></DOC>
