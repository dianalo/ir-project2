Transamerica, an insurance and financial services concern, said the sale will provide it with an after-tax gain of about $43 million, which will be recorded in the third quarter. In last year's third quarter, Transamerica earned $105.1 million, or $1.42 a share, including $43.2 million, or 60 cents a share, in income from discontinued operations. Revenue was $1.6 billion.    Transamerica began withdrawing from the airline business last year, as part of an effort to return to its core financial businesses. The company has ended all flight operations, and sold all but one plane. </TEXT></DOC>
