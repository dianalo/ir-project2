Food Aid To Refugee Camp May Have Gone to Guerrillas</HEAD><BYLINE>By PETER ENG</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A refugee camp in Thailand administeredby the communist Khmer Rouge may have diverted U.N. food deliveriesto guerrillas while blocking efforts to monitor how the aid wasused, sources said Tuesday.   The U.N. Border Relief Operation halted food deliveries startingMay 1 to Huay Chan, a Cambodian camp of about 9,000 people in theeastern province of Sisaket, said the sources, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   A U.N. source in New York, who is familiar with Huay Chan andasked not to be identified, said the camp operators were violatinga cardinal principle involved in food aid: that the delivery mustbe monitored and the U.N. agency must know that it has not beenmisued.   ``That principle has not been assured in that camp, and atseveral other camps for some time,'' he said.   Camp authorities had been given warnings about the monitoringproblems and told that they risked a cut-off in aid, he said.   He said that the camp appeared to have another, independentsource of food, which could make the U.N. food surplus fordiversion.   They said the France-based Operation Handicap International, theonly other aid group working in the camp, pulled out at the sametime in coordination with the United Nations agency.   The sources said the main concern in Khmer Rouge camps wasdiversion of food from civilians to guerrillas. The camps, alllocated near the Cambodian border, are believed to play some rolein military infiltration into Cambodia.   The agency has struggled for years to improve monitoring anddelivery of medical and other services to camps run by the KhmerRouge, the main guerrilla group fighting Vietnamese forcesoccupying Cambodia.   The Khmer Rouge massacred millions of Cambodians when they ruledthe country from 1975 until Vietnam invaded in late 1978.   Some officials say the Khmer Rouge keeps civilians in its campsin Thailand as virtual prisoners. There have been reports of peopledying of illness after camp authorities refused to allow theirevacuation to an outside hospital.   The only Khmer Rouge camp where access by aid officials hasn'tbeen a significant problem is Site 8, a showcase-type camp housing33,000 people in Prachinburi province south of Sisaket.   The other two guerrilla groups opposing the Vietnameseoccupation _ the non-communist forces of Son Sann and PrinceNorodom Sihanouk _ allow free access to their civilian camps alongthe border. About 300,000 Cambodians live in border camps.   The U.N. agency earlier threatened to halt aid to four``closed'' Khmer Rouge camps unless access was improved. Thesources said that during the past year, improvements were made atNatrao, Bo Rai and Ta Luan camps, where the agency finally was ableto post camp officers and send regular medical teams. These campshouse more than 30,000 people.   Authorities at Huay Chan resisted, however, and did little morethan allow relief officials on occasional escorted tours of thecamp, the sources said.   ``Huay Chan was not the only Khmer Rouge camp where (access) wasa problem but it was most flagrant in denying access,'' one sourcesaid. ``Their basic attitude was: you leave the supplies at thegate of the camp and we'll distribute them.''   Aid won't be resumed until access is improved, but the sourcessaid Huay Chan's administration has not reacted to the cut-off offood.   The U.N. agency had been giving to Huay Chan a little less thana pound of rice per person daily and other foodstuffs. It was notclear where alternative sources of food would come from, but theKhmer Rouge is known to get substantial aid from China, Thailandand other countries. The refugees raise vegetables and chickens inHuay Chan, the sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
