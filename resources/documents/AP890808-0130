New Zealand became nuclear-free during the five-year tenure ofhis predecessor, David Lange, who became involved in major disputeswith the United States and France over the issue.   Lange, 47, resigned Monday, citing health reasons, and thegoverning Labor Party chose Palmer to succeed him.   Palmer, also 47, said of Lange: ``You have led with a vision andhumanity that will be hard for any of us to match.''   The nuclear argument with France began because of that country'snuclear tests in the Pacific and grew when French agents bombed aGreenpeace ship docked in New Zealand, killing a photographer whoworked for the environmental organization.   Two agents involved in the 1985 bombing are back in France,despite an agreement with Lange's government that they would beassigned to a French atoll in the Pacific.   Prime Minister Rabbie Namaliu of Papua New Guinea said Tuesdayhe would miss Lange's ``fearless diplomacy.''   In a statement congratulating Palmer, State Department spokesmanRichard Bouchard said in Washington: ``the United States looksforward to productive dealings with New Zealand under hisleadership.''   Bob Hawke, prime minister of neighboring Australia, said he andPalmer were close despite some policy differences. Palmer told anews conference New Zealand's future well-being depended onAustralia.   The economy deteriorated while Lange was in office, partlybecause of tight regulation, and he appointed Roger Douglas toreform it.   Douglas deregulated industry, sold off state assets and wantedto go farther, but Lange said the social cost of moving so fast wastoo high.   Early last year, Lange rejected Douglas's plans to take hisapproach into social services and the labor market, sacredterritories to the Labor Party.   They argued in public and Lange fired Douglas last December.Douglas was re-elected to the Cabinet last week and Lange wassupposed to give him a portfolio Monday, but resigned instead.   In a final swipe at Douglas during his farewell speech, Langesaid the ``juggernaut of the New Right'' had been beaten.   An editorial Tuesday in the Sydney Morning Herald said: ``Thetiming of the resignation suggests that health was not his onlyconsideration. By resigning now he makes it more difficult for Mr.Douglas to become prime minister, something that might have happnedhad he held on to the end of the year.''   Lange suffered a heart attack a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
