It sought to provide clarifiedguidelines for the use of Export Administration Regulations andSection; 779.3,General License GTDA: technical data available to all destinations, andinvited comments from the public. This final rule includes some of thesuggestions made in the public comments on that proposed rule. A detaileddiscussion of the public comments is contained in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATIONsection of this document. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>effective date: </T2>This rule is effective October 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>for further information contact: </T2>Jim Seevaratnum, Bureau of ExportAdministration, Telephone: (202) 377-5695.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>supplementary information:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In addition to soliciting comments on the May 16, 1986 proposed clarification,the Department specifically requested public comments on the treatmentof software and on the definition of ``public availability.'' The Department received thirty-six responses, including comments from 14universities, six corporations, nine associations, and two individuals.The interagency Working Group on Export Controls and Scientific Communications,which had formulated the recommendations upon which the proposed changeswere based, met twice to consider the responses and to make recommendationsto the Department. Most public comments were positive and urged adoption of the proposed rule,although a few responses suggested fundamentally different approaches orrecommended that final adoption be postponed pending further study of theissues behind the proposed changes. There was general recognition thatthe guidelines clarified certain ambiguities in the regulations, and yetconformed with existing Commerce Department interpretations. The proposed revisions to andSection;andSection; 779.1 and 779.4 publishedin the May 1986 proposed rule were treated in the general revision to part779 of the EAR, which was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>in proposed form on October 13, 1988 (53 FR 40074).Specific comments were as follows: 1. <T3>Treatment of software. </T3>Public comment overwhelmingly favored retainingthe treatment of software as proposed. The Working Group also recommendedto Commerce that the treatment of software remain as proposed in the draftregulation. Consequently, no change has been made. 2. <T3>Definition of ``publicly available'' (section 779.3(b)). </T3>Commentson 779.3(b) were generally very favorable. Several commenters noted that because the term ``public domain'' is a term-of-artin copyright law, use of the same term in andSection; 779.3(b) might causeconfusion and unintentionally limit the meaning of the section to itemswith no copyright protection. They recommended that the phrase ``becomegenerally accessible to the interested public'' be substituted for thephrase ``are put into the public domain.'' The Working Group also recommendedthis change. Consequently, the subsection is changed to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Information is made public and so becomes ``publicly available'' whenit becomes generally accessible to the interested public in any form, including* * *.</ITAG>One Government commenter suggested that andSection;779.3(b) state explicitlythat information in issued patents available from the Patent and CopyrightOffice (that is, issued patents not covered by secrecy orders) is publiclyavailable. A new subparagraph has been added to andSection; 779.3(b) to thiseffect. Other comments noted that the scope of the items listed in andSection; 779.3(b)(1)should be expanded to include optical or laser disk media. The WorkingGroup agreed that it was not its intent to exclude such items and recommendedthat the language of the subsection be broadened. The Department concurs and the subsection has been revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(b) * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Publication in periodicals, books, print, electronic, or any othermedia * * *.</ITAG>Following interagency consultation, Commerce is clarifying the maximumprice at which technical data and software not otherwise publicly availablenonetheless qualifies for General License GTDA. Such maximum price maynot exclude the costs of reproduction and distribution. This reflects thecurrent practice of BXA. Many aspects of this provision of the rule areclarified in the question and answer section at the end of the rule. Asto mass-market software, proposed General License GTDU will provide muchof the additional relief software firms sought in the review of GeneralLicense GTDA and during the broader technical data review now coming toa close. Several other minor changes were suggested by a number of commenters, butnone were deemed as significant. 3. <T3>``Information resulting from fundamental research'' andSection; 779.3(c).</T3>Comments suggested that the phrase ``trade secrets'' as used in andSection;779.3(c)(2)(ii), ``university-based research'', was too narrow and restrictive.They argued that there is no significant difference between a sponsor'sprepublication review for inadvertent disclosure of trade secrets and reviewfor inadvertent disclosure of other proprietary information. The WorkingGroup agreed and recommended that the subsection be revised as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Prepublication review by a sponsor of university research solely toensure that publication would not inadvertently divulge proprietary informationthat the sponsor has furnished to the researchers does not change the ruledescribed in (c)(2)(i).</ITAG>One comment from within the Government suggested that for clarity and closerconformity with andSection; 779.3(f), andSection; 779.3(c)(4) be revised slightly.The Working Group agreed and recommended that it read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Research conducted by scientists or engineers working for a businessentity will be considered ``fundamental research'' at the time and to theextent that the researchers are free to make scientific and technical informationresulting from the research publicly available without restriction or delaybased on proprietary concerns or specific national security controls, asdetailed in paragraph (f) of this section.</ITAG>These recommendations have been adopted. 4. <T3>Impact of regulation on corporate activities. </T3>Several commentsfrom industry stated that although the proposed rules resolved many outstandingissues for the scientific and educational communities, they posed concernsfor industry that needed to be resolved: a. <T3>Proprietary research informally shared among scientists. </T3>Commentersquestioned the operational presumption of andSection; 779.3(c)(4) that corporateresearch will be considered ``fundamental research'' only when researchersare free to make their work ``available without restriction or delay basedon proprietary or national security considerations.'' They argued thatcertain research, which one commenter termed ``interim research'', maybe communicated between U.S. employees and foreign persons ``at a pointin time when it cannot yet be determined whether any prepublication reviewby the company is to be limited solely to non-compromise of patent rightsor whether the company prepublication review will have a broader purpose.''Put another way, certain data is communicated informally between and amongscientists_with the approval of the company_but is not allowed to be generallyreleased by publication or to be otherwise made available without the priorreview of the company. This type of data, it is argued, should be giventhe same treatment as ``university-based research'' in andSection; 779.3(c)(2).The difficulty is that there is no operational way to know, either beforeor after the fact, when these data are freed for open scientific communicationother than by the company's own actions. The presumption that researchresults will be openly published does not hold for corporate research asit does for university-based research. Corporate research, generally speaking,is intended to be proprietary. This limitation on corporate research in GTDA should not hamper commercialoperations extensively. In many cases, General License GTDR offers fullrelief. b. <T3>Prepublication review. </T3> Section 779.3(c)(2)(ii) permits researchconducted at universities to be considered ``fundamental research'' despitea sponsor's right to prepublication review if the review is ``solely''to ensure that the publication would not compromise patent rights or inadvertentlydivulge the sponsor's proprietary information provided by the sponsor tothe researchers.No similar exception was provided in andSection; 779.3(c)(4) for corporateresearch. This difference in treatment was objected to as having no publicpolicy justification. Section 779.3(c)(4) has been revised to eliminatethe difference, and the sentences at issue now read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that the publicationwould compromise no proprietary information provided by the company tothe researchers is not considered to be a proprietary restriction underparagraph (c)(4)(i) of this section. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Prepublication review by the company solely to ensure that prepublicationwould compromise no patent rights will not be considered a proprietaryrestriction for this purpose, so long as the review causes no more thana temporary delay in publication of the research results.</ITAG>c. <T3>Definition of ``fundamental research'' (andSection; 779.3(c)). </T3>Anumber of comments, including those from universities and other organizations,revealed confusion over the definition of ``fundamental research'' in andSection;779.3(c)(1). Some saw two hurdles to be overcome before qualifying underthe section_the definition in paragraph (c)(1) and the requirements ofparagraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4). Others saw contradictions between thedefinition and either the previously announced Presidential policy or otherparts of the section itself.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>Statement by Principal Deputy Press Secretary to the President,21 <T3>Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. </T3>1147 (Sept. 27, 1985).Section 779.3 (c)(2) through (c)(4) was written first and was always intendedto serve as the operational definition of the term ``fundamental research.''Section 779.3(c)(1) was added later, but logically put first to clarifythe intent behind the operational definitions. Section 779.3(c)(1) hasbeen revised with the hope of ending any confusion and reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Fundamental research. Paragraphs (c)(2) through (c)(4) and paragraph(f) provide specific operational rules that will be used to identify whetherresearch in particular institutional contexts qualifies as ``fundamentalresearch''. The intent behind those operational rules is to identify as``fundamental research'' basic and applied research in science and engineering,where the resulting information is ordinarily published and shared broadlywithin the scientific community. Such research can be distinguished fromproprietary research and from industrial development, design, production,and product utilization, the results of which ordinarily are restrictedfor proprietary or national security reasons.</ITAG>5. <T3>``Patent applications'', andSection; 779.3(e). </T3>The Council on GovernmentalRelations (COGR) and several universities suggested expanding GTDA coverageto include information contained in a patent application when sent to aforeign country before or within six months following the filing of a UnitedStates patent application for the purpose of obtaining the signature ofan inventor who was in the United States when the invention was made orwho is a co-inventor with a person residing in the United States. This suggested change has been added to andSection; 779.3(e).6. <T3>``Government-sponsored research covered by contract controls'', andSection;779.3(f).</T3> There was considerable comment on this section. Many ofthe comments were the result of misunderstanding the nuances of the sectionitself and its relation to andSection; 779.3(c) on ``fundamental research''and to previously announced Presidential policy. The Interagency WorkingGroup recommended that the subsection be unchanged, but it also recommendedthat a more detailed explanation of the intent behind the section be given.Commenters correctly noted that the definition of ``fundamental research''in andSection; 779.3(c)(1) parallels that set forth in previously announcedPresidential policy proclaiming as national policy that ``the productsof fundamental research remain unrestricted'' and that ``where the nationalsecurity requires control, the mechanism for control * * * is classification''.\2\<NOTE/> The comments suggested that andSection; 779.3(f), as presentlyformulated, is inconsistent with this policy.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>Id.</T3> at 1148.Consistent with the previously announced Presidential policy, andSection;779.3(c)(1) defines ``Fundamental research'' to exclude work ``the resultsof which * * * are restricted for national security reasons.'' Section779.3(f) deals with research that is indeed restricted for national securityreasons by specific controls agreed on in a contract or other funding agreement.In effect, however, it only partially exempts such work from the generallicense made available for ``fundamental research''. Section 779.3(f)(1)states that the general license remains available ``for any export of informationresulting from the research that is consistent with the specific controls''.The effect is to reinforce contract controls with remedies available underthe Export Administration Act, but to restrict scientific communicationas minimally as possible consistent with those controls. In effect, moreover,an institution accepting such a contract needs to be concerned only aboutcompliance with the contract controls it has agreed to, not with a secondset of requirements under these regulations.A number of rewordings were considered to make clearer the consistencyof andSection; 779.3(f) with the definition of ``fundamental research''.Each of them seemed either to allow an interpretation that would removethe intended partial availability of the general license, or to add toomany extra words and complications, or both. Therefore no change has beenmade from the proposed regulation. Neither the intent nor the effect ofthe regulatory language detracts from the previously announced Presidentialpolicy; on the contrary, these regulations provide a broader general licensethan would be strictly required by that policy.7. <T3>``Consulting'', andSection; 779.3(g).</T3> One commenter noted that andSection;779.3(g) on consulting was not necessary because it had no operative effectand stated the obvious. The Working Group, which recommended the subsection,recognized that it is redundant. The Working Group continues to believe,however, that because consulting is an especially effective mechanism oftechnology transfer, the section should remain as a reminder to personsthat while General License GTDA allows release of technical data describedin andSection; 779.3(a)(1) by means of a consulting arrangement, it doesno authorize release of other technical information or application abroadof other personal knowledge or technical experience acquired in the UnitedStates.Other comments argued that training is also an effective means of technologytransfer and should also be mentioned with consulting. The Working Groupagreed and the provision has been revised accordingly.Because the statement is merely cautionary, it has been redesignated asa note following andSection; 779.3(g), rather than a paragraph within it.It now reads:<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Consulting and training. Technical data can be inadvertentlyexported in various ways. Consulting and training are especially effectivemechanisms of technology transfer. The exporter should be aware that theDepartment of Commerce maintains controls on exports of technical datathat do not qualify for General License GTDA as described in paragraphs(a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, including application abroad ofpersonal knowldege or technical experience acquired in the United States.(See also paragraph (g)).</ITAG>Paragraph (h), Advice concerning uncontrolled information, has been redesignatedas paragraph (g).8. <T3>The term ``information''</T3> vs. <T3>``technical data''</T3>. One commenter urged that the word ``information''be changed to ``technical data'' wherever that word appeared in the regulations,since not all ``information'', but only ``technical data'', is controlledto begin with.``Information'' was deliberately used in this section because it is clearerfor persons unfamiliar with the terminology of export controls. The Departmenthas added a sentence to andSection; 779.3(a) to clarify that for the purposesof andSection; 779.3, the word ``information'' means ``technical data'' asdefined in andSection; 779.1, including software.9. <T3>New supplement with questions and answers.</T3> The Department hasadded a new supplement No. 5 to part 779 that provides questions and answerscovering major areas of interest.10. <T3>Miscellaneous changes.</T3> Some commenters read the final paragraphin andSection; 779.3(a), that begins ``However, see paragraph (f)'', as implyingan exception to subsection (1)-(4) that precede the paragraph. This wasnot the intent. The use of the word ``However'' to introduce the paragraphwas intended only as a clarification of andSection; 779.3(f) itself. Sincethe word ``However'' has caused confusion and is not necessary, it hasbeen deleted from the final text.<ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements</ITAG>1. This rule is consistent with Executive Orders 12291 and 12661.2. This rule involves export of information in connection with certainpatent applications related to technical data. The patent information requirements,which are subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>), have been cleared by the Office of Management and Budgetunder Control Number 0651-0011.3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612.4. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended (EAA)(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 533), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. This rule is not subject to section13(b) of the EAA because this rule does not impose new controls. Furtherno other law requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunityfor public comment be given for this rule. Nevertheless, to help ascertainthe impact of this regulation upon the general public, the regulation wasissued in proposed form and public comment was solicited.5. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment were not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553) or by any other law, undersection 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 603(a)and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared.These regulations are final. While the Department does not expect to makefurther changes to the rule published here, because of the importance ofthe issues raised by these regulations, the Department will consider furthercomments on this rule together with comments submitted in response to theproposed changes to the remainder of part 779, as published in the October13, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 40074).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 15 CFR Part 779</ITAG>Exports, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.Accordingly, part 779 of the Export Administration Regulations (15 CFRpart 779) is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 779_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.

A new supplement No. 5 to part 779 is added to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">Supplement No. 5 to Part 779_Questions and Answers_General LicenseGTDA </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This supplement No. 5 contains explanatory questions and answers aboutGeneral License GTDA. This Supplement is divided into six sections accordingto topic as follows: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section A:</T3> Publication of technical data and exports of technicaldata that has been or will be published.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section B:</T3> Release of technical data at conferences. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section C:</T3> Educational instruction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section D: </T3>Research, correspondence, and informal scientific exchanges.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section E: </T3>Federal contract controls.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section F: </T3>Commercial consulting.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section G: </T3>Software.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section H: </T3>Available in a public library.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Section I: </T3>Miscellaneous.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section A: Publication</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(1): </T3>I plan to publish in a foreign Journal a scientificpaper describing the results of my research, which is in an area listedin andSection; 779.4(d). Do I need a validated license?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. General License GTDA permits unrestricted export toany destination not only of technical data that are already publicly available,but of technical data that are made public by the transaction in question(andSection; 779.3(a)(1)). Your research results would be made public bythe planned publication. You would not need a validated license.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(2): </T3>Would the answer differ depending on where I workor where I performed the research?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. Of course, the General License would not relieve youfrom any restrictions on publications that your employer or another sponsorof your research may have imposed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(3): </T3>Would it make any difference if I published ina foreign journal? Would I need a validated license to send the paper tothe editors for review?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No to both questions. General license GTDA authorizessubmission of papers to editors or reviewers of journals, including foreignjournals, if the intention is that the papers will be published if favorablyreceived andSection; 779.3(b), last paragraph).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(4): </T3>The research on which I will be reporting in mypaper is supported by a grant from the Department of Energy. The grantrequires prepublication clearance by DOE. Does that make any differenceunder the Export Administration Regulations?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No; GTDA would still apply. But if you publish in violationof the controls you have accepted in the grant, you will be subject toappropriate administrative, civil, and possible criminal sanctions underother laws. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(5): </T3>We provide consulting services on the design, layout,and construction of integrated circuit plants and production lines. A majorpart of our business is the publication for sale to clients of detailedhandbooks and reference manuals on key aspects of the design and manufacturingprocesses. A typical cost of publishing such a handbook and manual mightbe $500; the typical sales price is around $15,000. Does general licenseGTDA cover publication and sale of such handbooks or manuals?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. The price is above the cost of reproduction and distribution(andSection; 779.3(b)(1)). Thus, you would need some other form of licensebefore you could export any of these handbooks or manuals.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(6): </T3>My Ph.D. thesis on a subject listed in andSection;779.4(d) has never been published for general distribution. However, itis available at the institution from which I took the degree. Do I needa validated license to send another copy to a collegue overseas?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>That may depend on where in the institution it is available.If it is not readily available in the university library (e.g., by filingin open stacks with a reference in the catalog), it is not ``publicly available''and the GTDA license would not be available on that ground. The GTDA licensewould still be applicable if your PH.D. research qualified as ``fundamentalresearch'' under andSection; 779.3(c). If not, however, you will need someother form of license before you can send a copy out of the country.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question A(7): </T3>We sell electronically recorded information, includingsoftware and databases, at wholesale and retail. Our products are availableby mail order to any member of the public, though intended for specialistsin various fields. They are priced to maximize sales to persons in thosefields. Do we need validated licenses to sell our products to foreign customers?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>You would not need a validated license for otherwise controlledtechnical data or software if the technical data and software are madepublicly available at a price that does not exceed the cost of productionand distribution to the technical community. Even if priced at a higherlevel, General License GTDA authorizes the export if the technical dataor software source code is in a library accessible to the public. (andSection;779.3(b)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section B. Conferences</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question B(1): </T3>I have been invited to give a paper at a prestigiousinternational scientific conference on a subject listed in andSection; 779.4(d).Scientists in the field are given an opportunity to submit applicationsto attend. Invitations are given to those judged by a panel of scientificpeers to be the leading researchers in the field, and attendance is byinvitation only. Attendees will be free to take notes, but not make electronicor verbatim recordings of the presentations or discussions. Some of theattendees will be foreigners. Do I need a validated license to give mypaper?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. General license GTDA is available for release of informationat an open conference. The conference you decribe fits the definition ofan open conference (andSection; 779.3(a)(1) and (b)(4)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question B(2): </T3>Would it make any difference if there were a prohibitionon making any notes or other personal record of what transpires at theconference?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Yes. To qualify as an ``open'' conference, attendees mustbe permitted to take notes or otherwise make a personal record (althoughnot necessarily a recording). If note taking or the making of personalrecords as altogether prohibited, the conference would not be considered``open.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question B(3): </T3>Would it make any difference if there were alsoa registration fee?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>That would depend on whether the fee is reasonably relatedto costs and reflects an intention that all interested and technicallyqualified persons should be able to attend (andSection; 779.3(b)(4)(ii)(A)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question B(4): </T3>Would it make any difference if the conferencewere to take place in another country?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question B(5): </T3>Must I have a validated license to send the paperI propose to present at such a foreign conference to the conference organizerfor review?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. General license GTDA authorizes submission of papersto foreign organizers of open conferences or other open gatherings withthe intention that the papers will be delivered at the conference, andso made publicly available, if favorably received (andSection; 779.3(b),last paragraph).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question B(6): </T3>Would the answers to any of the foregoing questionsbe different if my work were supported by the Federal Government?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. You may use GTDA to export the papers, even if therelease of the paper violates any agreements you have made with your governmentsponsor. However, nothing in the Export Administration Regulations relievesyou of responsibility for conforming to any controls you have agreed toin your Federal grant or contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section C: Educational Instruction</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question C(1): </T3>I teach a university graduate course on designand manufacture of very high-speed integrated circuitry. Many of the studentsare foreigners. Do I need a validated license to teach this course?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. Release of information by instruction in catalog coursesand associated teaching laboratories of academic institutions is licensedunder general license GTDA (andSection; 779.3(d)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question C(2): </T3>Would it make any difference if some of the studentswere from Communist Bloc countries?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question C(3): </T3>Would it make any difference if I talk about recentand as yet unpublished results from my laboratory research?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question C(4): </T3>Even if that research is funded by the Government?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Even then the general license would apply, but the exportAdministration Regulations would not release you from any separate obligationsyou have accepted in your grant or contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question C(5): </T3>Would it make any difference if I were teachingat a foreign university?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question C(6): </T3>We teach proprietary courses on design and manufactureof high-performance aircraft and missiles. Is the instruction in our classescovered by the GTDA license?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>That instruction would not qualify as ``release of educationalinformation'' under andSection;779.3(a)(3) because your proprietary businessdoes not qualify as an ``academic institution'' within the meaning of andSection;779.3(d).Conceivably, however, the instruction might qualify as ``release at anopen * * * seminar, * * * or other open gathering'' under andSection;779.3(b)(4).The conditions for qualification of such a seminar or gathering as ``open,''including a fee ``reasonably related to costs (of the conference, not ofproducing the data) and reflecting an intention that all interested andtechnically qualified persons be able to attend,'' would have to be satisfied.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section D: Research, Correspondence, and Informal Scientific Exchanges</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(1): </T3>Do I need a validated license in order for a foreigngraduate student to work in my laboratory?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Not if the research on which the foreign student is workingqualifies as ``fundamental research'' under andSection;779.3(c). In thatcase, the GTDA general license is available.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(2): </T3>Our company has entered into a cooperative researcharrangement with a research group at a university. One of the researchersin that group is a Polish national. We would like to share some of ourproprietary information with the university research group. We have noway of guaranteeing that this information will not get into the hands ofthe Polish scientist. Do we need to obtain a validated license to protectagainst that possibility?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No. General License GTDA authorizes the disclosure ofinformation to any scientists, engineers, or students at a U.S. universityin the course of industry-university research collaboration under specificarrangements between a firm and the university, provided these arrangementsdo not permit the sponsor to withhold from publication any of the informationthat he provides to the researchers. However, if your company and the researchershave agreed to a prohibition on publication, then you must qualify foranother general license or obtain a validated license before transferringthe information to the university. It is important that you as the corporatesponsor and the university get together to discuss whether foreign nationalswill have access to the information, so that you may obtain any necessaryexport authorization prior to transferring the information to the researchteam.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(3): </T3>My university will host a prominent scientist fromthe Soviet Union who is an expert on research in engineered ceramics andcomposite materials. Do I require a validated license before telling ourvisitor about my latest, as yet unpublished, research results in thosefields?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Probably not. If you performed your research at the university,and you were subject to no contract controls on release of research resultsagreed to with a sponsor of the research, your research would qualify as``fundamental research'' (andSection;779.3(c)(2)). Unrestricted export ofinformation arising during or resulting from such research is covered bygeneral license GTDA (779.3(a)(2)). You should probably assume, however,that your visitor will be debriefed later about anything of potential militaryvalue he learns from you. If you are concerned that giving such informationto him, even though licensed, could jeopardize U.S. security interests,the Commerce Department can put you in touch with appropriate Governmentscientists who can advise you. Write to Department of Commerce, Bureauof Export Administration, Office of Technology and Policy Analysis, P.O.Box 273, Washington, DC 20044.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(4): </T3>Would it make any difference if I were proposingto talk with a Soviet expert in the Soviet Union?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>No, if the information in question arose during or resultedfrom the same ``fundamental research.''</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(5): </T3>Could I properly do some work with him in his researchlaboratory inside the Soviet Union?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Application abroad of personal knowledge or technicalexperience acquired in the United States constitutes an export of thatknowledge and experience, and such an export is subject to the Export AdministrationRegulations (andSection;779.1(b)(1)(iii) and (2)(iii) and andSection;779.2).Such an export must be licensed. If any of the knowledge or experienceyou export in this way is not covered by general license, you would needa validated license.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(6): </T3>I would like to correspond and share research resultswith a Soviet-Bloc expert in my field, which is listed in andSection;779.4(d).Do I require a validated license to do so?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Not as long as we are still talking about informationthat arose during or resulted from research that qualifies as ``fundamental''under the rules spelled out in andSection;779.3(c).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(7): </T3>Suppose the research in question were funded bya corporate sponsor and I had agreed to prepublication review of any paperarising from the research?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Whether your research would still qualify as ``fundamental''would depend on the nature and purpose of the prepublication review. Ifthe review is intended solely to ensure that your publications will neithercompromise patent rights nor inadvertently divulge proprietary informationthat the sponsor has furnished to you, the research could still qualifyas ``fundamental.'' But if the sponsor will consider as part of its prepublicationreview whether it wants to hold your new research results as trade secretsor otherwise proprietary information (even if your voluntary cooperationwould be needed for it to do so), your research would no longer qualifyas ``fundamental.'' As used in these regulations it is the actual and intendedopenness of research results that primarily determines whether the researchcounts as ``fundamental'' and so comes under general license GTDA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(8): </T3>In determining whether research is thus open andtherefore counts as ``fundamental,'' does it matter where or in what sortof institution the research is performed?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>In principle, no. ``Fundamental research'' is performedin industry, Federal laboratories, or other types of institutions, as wellas in universities. The regulations introduce some operational presumptionsand procedures that can be used both by those subject to the regulationsand by those who administer them to determine with some precision whethera particular research activity is covered. Recognizing that common andpredictable norms operate in different types of institutions, the regulationsuse the institutional locus of the research as a starting point for thesepresumptions and procedures. Nonetheless, it remains the type of research,and particularly the intent and freedom to publish, that identifies ``fundamentalresearch''_not the institutional locus (andSection; 779.3(c)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(9): </T3>I am doing research on high-powered lasers in thecentral basic-research laboratory of an industrial corporation. I am requiredto submit the results of my research for prepublication review before Ican publish them or otherwise make them public. I would like to compareresearch results with a scientific colleague from an East Bloc countryand discuss the results of the research with her when she visits the UnitedStates. Do I need a validated license to do so?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>You probably do need a validated license (andSection; 779.3(c)(4)).However, if the only restriction on your publishing any of that informationis a prepublication review solely to ensure that publication would compromiseno patent rights or proprietary information provided by the company tothe researcher your research may be considered ``fundamental research,''in which case you may be able to share information under the GTDA generallicense. Note that GTDA will not be available if the prepublication reviewis intended to withhold the results of the research from publication.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(10): </T3>Suppose I have already cleared my company's reviewprocess and am free to publish all the information I intend to share withmy colleague, though I have not yet published?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>If the clearance from your company means that you arefree to make all the information publicly available without restrictionor delay, the GTDA license will apply and you will not need a validatedlicense for this exchange (andSection; 779.3(c)(4)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question D(11): </T3>I work as a researcher at a Government-owned,contractor-operated research center. May I share the results of my unpublishedresearch with foreign nationals without concern for export controls underthe Export Administration Regulations?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>That is up to the sponsoring agency and the center's management.If your research is designated ``fundamental research'' within any appropriatesystem devised by them to control release of information by scientistsand engineers at the center, it will be treated as such by the CommerceDepartment, and the GTDA license will apply. Otherwise, you would needsome other form of license, except to publish or otherwise make the informationpublic (andSection; 779.3(c)(3)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section E: Federal Contract Controls</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question E(1): </T3>In a contract for performance of research enteredinto with the Department of Defense, we have agreed to certain nationalsecurity controls. DOD is to have ninety days to review any papers we proposedbefore they are published and must approve assignment of any foreign nationalsto the project. The work in question would otherwise qualify as ``fundamentalresearch'' under andSection; 779.3(c). Does the GTDA license cover informationarising during or resulting from this sponsored research?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Any ``export'' inconsistent with the controls you haveagreed to will not qualify for export under GTDA as ``fundamental research.''Any ``export'' consistent with the controls will qualify for export underGTDA as ``fundamental research.'' Thus, if you abide by the specific controlsyou have agreed to, you need not be concerned about violating the ExportAdministration Regulations. If you violate those controls and export informationas ``fundamental research'' under andSection; 779.3(c), you may subject yourselfto the sanctions provided for under the Export Administration Regulations,including criminal sanctions, in addition to administrative and civil remediesfor breach of contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question E(2): </T3>Do the Export Administration Regulations restrictmy ability to publish the results of my research?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>The Export Administration Regulations are not the meansfor enforcing the national security controls you have agreed to. If sucha publication violates the contract, you would be subject to administrative,civil, and possible criminal penalties under other law.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section F: Commercial Consulting</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question F(1): </T3>I am a professor at a U.S. university, with expertisein design and creation of submicron devices. I have been asked to be aconsultant for a ``third-world'' company that wishes to manufacture suchdevices. Do I need a validated license to do so?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Quite possibly you do. Application abroad of personalknowledge or technical experience acquired in the United States constitutesan export of that knowledge and experience that is subject to the ExportAdministration Regulations (andSection;779.1(b) (1)(iii) and (2)(iii), andandSection;779.2). Such an export must be licensed. If any part of the knowledgeor experience you export in this way is not covered by general license,you would need a validated license.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section G: Software</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question G(1): </T3> Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof software in machine readable code when the source code for such softwareis publicly available?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>If the source code of a software program is publicly available,then the machine readable code compiled from the source code is softwarethat is publicly available and therefore eligible for General License GTDA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question G(2): </T3> Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof software sold at a price that does not exceed the cost of reproductionand distribution?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Software in machine readable code is publicly availableif it is available to a community at a price that does not exceed the costof reproduction and distribution. Such reproduction and distribution costsmay include variable and fixed allocations of overhead and normal profitfor the reproduction and distribution functions either in your companyor in a third party distribution system. In your company, such costs maynot include recovery for development, design, or acquisition. In this case,the provider of the software does not receive a fee for the inherent valueof the software.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question G(3): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof software sold at a price BXA concludes in a classification letter tobe sufficiently low to qualify the particular software for General LicenseGTDA?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>In response to classification requests, BXA may chooseto classify certain software as eligible for General License GTDA eventhough it is sold at a price above the costs of reproduction and distributionas long as the price is nonetheless sufficiently low to qualify for sucha classification in the judgment of BXA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section H: Available in a Public Library</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question H(1): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof information available in a library and sold through an electronic orprint service?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Electronic and print services for the distribution ofinformation may be relatively expensive in the marketplace because of thevalue vendors add in retrieving and organizing information in a usefulway. If such information is also available in a library_itself accessibleto the public_or has been published in any way, that information is ``publiclyavailable'' for those reasons, and the information itself remains eligiblefor General License GTDA even though you access the information throughan electronic or print service for which you or your employer pay a substantialfee.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question H(2): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof information available in an electronic form in a library at no chargeto the library patron?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Information available in an electronic form at no chargeto the library patron in a library accessible to the public is informationpublicly available even though the library pays a substantial subscriptionfee for the electronic retrieval service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question H(3): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof information available in a library and sold for more than the cost ofreproduction and distribution?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Information from books, magazines, dissertations, papers,electronic data bases, and other information available in a library thatis accessible to the public qualifies for General License GTDA. This istrue even if you purchase such a book at more than the cost of reproductionand distribution. In other words, such information is ``publicly available''even though the author makes a profit on your particular purchase for theinherent value of the information.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">Section I: Miscellaneous</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question I(1): </T3>The manufacturing plant that I work at is planningto begin admitting groups of the general public to tour the plant facilities.We are concerned that an export license might be required if the tour groupsinclude foreign nationals. Would such a tour constitute an export? If so,does General License GTDA authorize this type of export?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>EAR andSection; 779.1(b) defines exports of technical datato include release through visual inspection by foreign nationals of U.S.-originequipment and facilities. Consequently, you must obtain export authorizationprior to permitting foreign nationals to tour your facilities. Such anexport qualifies under the ``publicity available'' provision of GeneralLicense GTDA so long as the tour is truly open to all members of the public,including your competitors, and you do not charge a fee that is not reasonablyrelated to the cost of conducting the tours (andSection; 779.3(a)(1)). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question I(2): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof information not in a library or published, but sold at a price thatdoes not exceed the cost of reproduction and distribution? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Information that is not in a library accessible to thepublic and that has not been published in any way, may nonetheless become``publicly available'' if you make it both available to a community ofpersons and if you sell it at no more than the cost of reproduction anddistribution. Such reproduction and distribution costs may include variableand fixed cost allocations of overhead and normal profit for the reproductionand distribution functions either in your company or in a third party distributionsystem. In your company, such costs may not include recovery for development,design, or acquisition of the technical data or software. The reason forthis conclusion is that the provider of the information receives nothingfor the inherent value of the information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question I(3): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof information contributed to an electronic bulletin board? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Assume each of the following: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. Information is uploaded to an electronic bulletin board by a personthat is the owner or originator of the information; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. That person does not charge a fee to the bulletin board administratoror the subscribers of the bulletin board; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The bulletin board is available for subscription to any subscriberin a given community regardless of the cost of subscription. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Such information is ``publicly available'' and therefore eligiblefor General License GTDA even if it is not elsewhere published and is notin a library. The reason for this conclusion is that the bulletin boardsubscription charges or line charges are for distribution exclusively,and the provider of the information receives nothing for the inherent valueof the information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Question I(4): </T3>Does General License GTDA authorize the exportof patented information fully disclosed on the public record? </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Answer: </T3>Information to the extent it is disclosed on the patentrecord open to the public is eligible for General License GTDA even thoughyou may use such information only after paying a fee in excess of the costsof reproduction and distribution. In this case the seller does receivea fee for the inherent value of the technical data; however, General LicenseGTDA is nonetheless available because any person can obtain the technicaldata from the public record and further disclose or publish the information.For that reason, it is impossible to impose export controls that deny accessto the information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 25, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James M.
