In three formal presentations and many privateconversations, the delegation sought to refute U.S.allegations that the epidemic had been caused by a leak ofanthrax spores from a military facility in Sverdlovsk.Washington had accused the Soviets of conducting germ-warfareactivities at the facility in violation of a 1972 conventionon biological weapons.</LP><TEXT>   Not true, insisted the Soviet delegation, and in anapparent show of glasnost, they gave the most detailedaccount to date of what they said had really happened. Theepidemic was a tragic accident that bore no relation to germwarfare, they said. Because of sloppy procedures, a naturaloutbreak of anthrax among animals in the Sverdlovsk regionhad worked its way into the food chain. Sixty-four peopledied -- not hundreds, as emigre accounts estimated -- aftereating poisoned meat bought from untested, private sources.   The account was compelling, not least because it wasbacked up by medical slides that seemed to support thetainted-meat theory, and it tallied with Moscow's earlier butless detailed explanations of the outbreak. Matthew S.Meselson, a biochemistry professor at Harvard University whohad invited the Soviet delegation over, described theirversion in an article published after the visit as &quot;plausibleand consistent with what is known from previous outbreaks ofhuman and animal anthrax in the U.S.S.R. and elsewhere.&quot;   In fact, the Soviet explanation doesn't stand up to closescrutiny. A two-month investigation, including three visitsto Sverdlovsk and interviews with dozens of people connectedto the outbreak, finds that the official Soviet version isriddled with inconsistencies, half-truths and plainfalsehoods.   Anomalies in the official Soviet version don't proveconclusively that the U.S. allegations about germ warfare aretrue. But many troubling questions are raised by the evidencefound in Sverdlovsk. If the military facility wasn'tinvolved, why is it that all the victims I managed to tracelived or worked in a very small area next to it? If theoutbreak really was caused by poisoned meat, why has the KGBgone to such lengths to cover up the facts? And why does itcontinue to this day to harrass journalists trying toinvestigate?   The world deserves an answer. And Soviets like LarisaSyskov deserve an answer too. Twelve years ago, she watched,helpless, as her 27-year-old husband Alexei died a sudden andgruesome death from anthrax. Her grief was made even harderto bear by the complete absence of any official explanationas to what had happened. &quot;Nobody said anything. There werejust lots of rumors,&quot; she says, tears welling up in her eyes.&quot;We were so used to believing what we were told.&quot;   The most glaring inconsistencies in the Soviet accountconcern the anthrax-tainted meat itself. The Sovietdelegation to the U.S. told their U.S. audiences that anthraxwas a common disease among livestock in the Sverdlosk region,and they described in detail how it accidentally entered thefood chain in 1979. The bones of diseased animals were groundinto meal for use as animal fodder at a plant in a villageabout 10 miles south of Sverdlovsk. The factory, they said,violated regulations by not sterilizing the bone mealproperly -- an oversight that allowed anthrax spores to liveon. A 29-ton lot of the contaminated meal was then sold bythe factory in late March 1979 to private owners oflivestock, some of whose animals became infected. Theseanimals were slaughtered and their owners sold the meat onthe street to private individuals, who ate it and died.   This account tallies with details given to Harvard's Prof.Meselson two years previously, when he visited Moscow fortalks with Soviet officials. In September 1988, after thedelegation's U.S. visit, he published a long account of theSoviet explanation in the Journal of the Federation ofAmerican Scientists. &quot;At a meat processing plant at Aramil,&quot;he wrote, &quot;autoclave pressure readings were not taken,records of sterilization times were not kept, the rawmaterial and the autoclaved material were handled in the samearea and transported in the same wheelbarrows, andmicrobiological analysis was not carried out.&quot;   In fact, there is no meat processing plant in Aramil, apicturesque village of simple wooden houses set in rollinghills. At the top of one of these hills is a small flourmill, the Aramil Bread Products Combinat, that supplies localbakeries. In one part of the mill is a shop where variousingredients bought elsewhere, including fish meal and bonemeal, are mixed into animal feed. But there is noslaughterhouse of any kind at the plant, or anywhere in thearea.   The factory's director, Boris Martyanov, is a wiry55-year-old who greets a visitor in his flat cap and rubberboots. In 1979, he was in charge of the mill's mixed-feeddepartment. Told about the Soviet explanation, he pauses inastonishment before refuting it.   &quot;We are consumers of bone meal, not producers,&quot; heexplains carefully. &quot;We never produced bone meal. We get itready-made from a Sverdlovsk slaughter house or elsewhere.All shipments come with a certificate of quality.&quot; As forautoclaves, pressure readings, sterilization equipment andthe like, his answer is simple: &quot;We don't have and never didhave such technology. We don't have the production(facilities) that would enable us to make bone meal or anyother feed from livestock.&quot;   Prof. Meselson seemed taken aback when asked about thismajor discrepancy. After reviewing his notes, he tried tocover himself. &quot;I have always assumed that the actualproduction of the meal, not just the distribution or testing,was done at Aramil,&quot; he wrote. But, he added, &quot;now that thequestion has been raised, I cannot confirm that actualproduction as distinct, for example, from distribution did infact occur at Aramil.&quot;   Sloppy note-taking could possibly account for thisdiscrepancy. But there is one other major anomaly that isharder to explain away, not least because it was publiclystated several times by Pyotr N. Burgasov, a former deputyhealth minister, during the U.S. tour, which he led. Theanomaly concerns the supposed sale and distribution of a29-ton lot of contaminated feed to private livestock owners.   At the time, the dying days of the Brezhnev era, privatefarming was actively discouraged in the Soviet Union.   Mr. Martyanov, the Aramil factory director, is adamant:&quot;In 1979, we never sold mixed feed to private individuals,&quot;he says. &quot;Our only customers were state organizations.&quot; Is itpossible that a special decision was taken by localauthorities on this one occasion, as Mr. Burgasov hadclaimed? Mr. Martyanov's answer: a categorical &quot;no.&quot;   One man who would have known about the special decision,if there had been one, is Alexander Laptev. In 1979, he waschairman of Aramil's executive council, the Big Man of thevillage. Now 65 years old and retired, he sits on his bed inone of Aramil's wooden houses, his mouth wide open at thesuggestion that the flour mill could have been responsiblefor the epidemic.   &quot;I worked for 29 years and never heard of a single case ofanthrax,&quot; he says. He remembers one problem with aconsignment of fish meal that came from the Soviet Far Eastcovered in flies. But contaminated bone meal? &quot;Not a word wasmentioned,&quot; he says. And he should know: He would have beenthe first to lose his job, or at least be reprimanded for thesupposed violations. Nothing of the sort happened. &quot;Not asingle official came to see me,&quot; he says. &quot;Nobody mentionedit.&quot;   Mr. Burgasov, now retired and living at a dacha outsideMoscow, won't comment on these or any other points raised inthis series of articles. Of the other two delegation memberswho traveled to the U.S., one, Dr. Vladimir N. Nikiforov hasdied. The other, Vladimir P. Sergiyev, says he isn't familiarwith most details. Unlike the other two men who were inSverdlovsk for much of the epidemic, Mr. Sergiyev stayed inMoscow, where he worked at the Ministry of Health. He says hebriefed himself on the events before traveling to the U.S. byreading an official Health Ministry account of the epidemic.That account has disappeared -- along with almost all otherrelevant documents.   One official in Sverdlovsk who is in a position to know atleast some of the details is Valentin Yaroslavtsev. He is theSverdlovsk region's chief veterinarian, a post he also heldback in 1979. He is deeply skeptical about the officialexplanation for the epidemic. In his 20 years of working inthe region, he can remember a few natural outbreaks ofanthrax among livestock. But he doesn't know of any casewhere it got into the food chain. And, he adds: &quot;I don'tremember any time when we found the source.&quot;   ---   Mr. Gumbel is the Journal's Moscow bureau chief.
