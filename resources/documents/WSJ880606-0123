Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FORGN </CO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> CNG SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   More than one-third of all cases of suspected insider trading referred by stock exchanges to the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1986 and 1987 involved foreign brokerage firms, according to a government study.    Of the total of 609 instances of possible insider trading the exchanges asked the SEC to investigate during that period, some 226 involved &quot;suspicious trades executed through foreign institutions,&quot; according to the report by the General Accounting Office.    A final draft of the GAO report is being reviewed by the SEC before it is made public. The SEC didn't have any immediate comment.    The GAO study of the SEC's efforts to police insider trading also says that, in one case, approximately 30 firms in 10 countries traded 265,900 shares of one company during the six days before a tender offer was made for that company.    The company isn't identified in the report, but this newspaper reported last year that it is Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc., which was the target of a hostile tender offer by Limited Inc. in April 1984. Judging by the profit insider trader Dennis Levine is said by the SEC to have made from his own pre-announcement purchases of Carter Hawley Hale, the foreign entities appear to have made about $1.7 million on the transaction.    The GAO report is generally sympathetic to the SEC's efforts. It describes at some length, for example, the difficulties the agency faces in pursuing insider trading based in Switzerland, even though the SEC now has a memorandum of understanding with that nation.    This process can involve referrals to a panel of the Swiss Bankers' Association, the bank that handled the transaction, the customer involved and the Swiss police. The report implies that, because of this unwieldy process, the SEC doesn't pursue some foreign cases that it would prosecute if they occurred in this country.    The report recommends the SEC take three steps to strengthen its efforts against suspicious foreign trading. The report says the SEC's enforcement staff has reviewed the proposed steps and believes &quot;they have merit.&quot;    First, the GAO says, the SEC should analyze trends in suspicious overseas trading and use that data as a negotiating tool. &quot;If a foreign financial institution is repeatedly identified as trading before corporate events, SEC could use this information to help persuade foreign governments and institutions to release information,&quot; it says.    Second, the report says, the SEC should require U.S. brokerage firms processing orders from foreign institutions to break out the order into individual transactions, rather than handle it in bulk through an &quot;omnibus account,&quot; as is the current practice. Such information would give the SEC a better sense of what to pursue and help it convince foreign regulators it isn't on a fishing expedition when it makes a request, the report says.    Finally, it says, information obtained by the SEC from foreign governments should be exempted from Freedom of Information Act requirements. It says foreign regulators have complained that the SEC can't guarantee confidentiality because, under the act, the SEC can be required to release its files once it closes an investigation. The SEC conveyed that recommendation to Congress on Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
