Method: In addition to a calculation device, a display deviceand a memory device disposed in a control room, a second display deviceand a switch panel are disposed in a reactor container. Neutron fluxsignals from neutron source region and signals indicating the reachingof a fuel assembly to the reactor bottom are inputted to the calculationdevice to calculate the counting rate and the inverted multiplicationfactor. The values are compared with standard counting rate to form acontrol signal for the separation of the fuel assembly. The calculatedvalue is displayed on the display device in the control room and theprocess data are stored in the memory device. Further, the values aredisplayed on the second display device and switching operation is madebetween the automatic separation and manual separation for the fuel assembly.In this way, since the criticality can be controlled only from a fuelexchange crane, the criticality control in the central control room isno more necessary to enable the decrease in the number of workers andautomatic operation.
