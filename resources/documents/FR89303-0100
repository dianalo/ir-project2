Overthe years the determination of what constitutes a domestic unmanufacturedproduct has been based simply on the geographic origin of the product.Determining what constitutes a domestic manufactured product has been moredifficult, however, and has ultimately come to be based on where the finalmanufacturing occurred and where the cost of mining, producing, or manufacturingthe components of such a product was incurred. Depending on the methodof acquisition and the agency involved, domestic products are given 6,12, or 50 percent price evaluation preferences over foreign products inthe award of Federal procurement contracts. Such price evaluation preferencesare waived under certain conditions for signatory countries of the GATTAgreement on Government Procurement (the Agreement) and they do not applyto procurements conducted in accordance with Defense Department Memorandaof Understanding.In 1988, the Act was amended by several sections of Title VII of Pub. L.100-418 to include provisions prohibiting Federal agencies from purchasingproducts and services from individuals or organizations of (1) countriesthat signed but have not abided by the Agreement; (2) countries that signedand have abided by the Agreement, but which discriminate against U.S. productsand services not covered by the Agreement in their government procurements(Note: The prohibition here only covers products and services not coveredby the Agreement); and (3) countries that have not signed the Agreementand which discriminate against U.S. products and services in their governmentprocurements. To fall into these latter two categories, the country's servicesand products must be acquired in significant amounts by the U.S. Governmentand it must maintain, in its government procurements, a significant andpersistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. productswhich results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Identification ofcountries that are determined to discriminate within the meaning of theAct will be made no later than April 30, 1990. Enactment of these provisionsmarks the first time that the Act proscribes as well as prescribes Federalagency behavior and pertains to services as well as products.In bringing services in the above described circumstances within the purviewof the Act, the 1988 amendments also provided a rule for determining whatconstitutes foreign constuction services. They did not, however, define``construction services.'' Nor did they define ``services other than constructionservices''. The Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy was giventhe task of developing policy guidance on determining whether a contractoror subcontractor is a citizen or national of a foreign country or is ownedor controlled directly or indirectly by citizens or nationals of a foreigncountry, for the purposes of the Act. The policy guidance is required tobe issued not later than February 19, 1989 (i.e., 180 days after enactmentof Public Law 100-418).The Administrator therefore convened a public hearing on December 15, 1988.At this hearing, two witnesses presented views, ideas, and suggestionson the proposed policy guidance. Written statements of four others whowere unable to speak at this public hearing were submitted for inclusionin the record.Most comments focused on ways in which the illustrative list of what constitutesa ``service other than a construction service'' might be improved. As aresult of these suggestions, several changes were made in the policy guidance.In addition, several of the commentators suggested that, as a matter oftrade policy, it would be preferable to craft an exception to the proposedguidance on ownership or control where the foreign contractor or subcontractorwould employ a majority of U.S. workers in the performance of the contract.It was concluded that, although the citizenship or nationality of a contractor'sworkers may be one of the factors considered in determining whether anexception to the statutory restrictions should be granted under sections4(c) of 4(d) of the Act, it could not properly be used as a basis for determiningthat a contractor is not foreign owned or controlled and thus not subjectto the Act at all.After careful consideration of all comments duly received, the followingpolicy guidance is hereby issued to Federal departments and agencies bythe Office of Federal Procurement Policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Policy Guidance</ITAG>1. <T3>Question</T3>_Do the amendments made to the Buy American Act of 1933(the Act) by Section 7002 of Pub. L. 100-418 require Federal agencies togive preferences to domestic services in procurements?<T3>Answer</T3>_No, the amendments made to the Act by Section 7002 of Pub.L. 100-418 do not extend the preferential purchase requirements of theAct to services. Instead, the amendments prohibit Federal agencies fromprocuring services as well as products from individuals or organizationsof (1) countries that signed but have not abided by the Gatt Agreementon Government Procurement (the Agreement); (2) countries that signed andhave abided by the Agreement, but which discriminate against U.S. productsand services not covered by the Agreement in their government procurements.(Note: The prohibition here only covers products and services not coveredby the Agreement); and (3) countries that have not signed the Agreementand which have been identified by the U.S. Trade Representative in theannual report on foreign discrimination pursuant to section 7003(d)(2)(C)of Pub. L. 100-418 and determined by the President to be subject to sanctionsbecause of discrimination against U.S. products and services in their governmentprocurements. To fall into categories 2 and 3 above, the country's servicesand products must be acquired in significant amounts by the U.S. Governmentand it must maintain, in its government procurements, a significant andpersistent pattern or practice of discrimination against U.S. productswhich results in identifiable harm to U.S. businesses. Identification ofcountries within all three categories above is to be made annually no laterthan April 30 beginning in 1990. In summary, the Act as amended prohibitsFederal agencies under certain conditions from procuring either servicesor products from individuals or organizations of countries subject to sanctionsfor discriminating against U.S. products and services in making their governmentprocurements. 2. <T3>Question</T3>_Are there exceptions to the prohibitions on the procurementof services set forth in Section 7002 of Pub. L. 100-418? <T3>Answer</T3>_Yes, the prohibitions do not apply to: (1) services procuredand used outside the United States and its territories; and (2) servicesof least developed countries. Also, the President or the head of a Federalagency may exempt procurements from these prohibitions upon a determinationthat such action is necessary in the public interest, or to ensure adequatecompetition. 3. <T3>Question</T3>_When do the prohibitions on procurement by Federal agenciesof services from individuals or organizations of specified countries gointo effect? <T3>Answer</T3>_The prohibitions on the procurement of services by Federalagencies from individuals or organizations of specified countries willnot take effect until 60 days after the first annual report mandated bySection 7003 of Pub. L. 100-418 is submitted to Congress. This annuallyproduced report will list the countries that discriminate against U.S.products and services in making their government procurements. For somespecified countries that are signatories of the Gatt Agreement on GovernmentProcurement, prohibitions imposed by the President would go into effectonly after dispute resolution procedures had failed to produce a settlementwithin one year of their initiation. 4. <T3>Question</T3>_Do the prohibitions on the procurement of services fromindividuals or organizations of specified countries apply to grants? Dothe prohibitions apply to contracts awarded by grantees using grant funds?<T3>Answer_</T3>No, the prohibitions pertain only to services providedby contractor and subcontractors under procurement contracts. They do notpertain to services provided by grantees, contractors, or subcontractorsusing grant funds.5. <T3>Question_</T3>What constitute ``construction services'' for purposesof implementing the Act as amended by Section 7002 of Pub.
