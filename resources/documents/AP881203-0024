The newspaper Sovietskaya Rossia on Friday quoted Lt. Gen. IvanKatargin of the Interior Ministry as saying, ``Exile is being ruledout as inexpedient.''   Internal exile as a form of punishment dates to the czars and hasbeen used against criminals, revolutionaries, political prisoners,their relatives and, during the worst of Josef Stalin's purges,people deemed ``socially dangerous.''   Whole populations have been deported from their homes to Siberiaand the far north, including returning prisoners of war, farmersduring the period of collectivization in the 1930s and residents ofthe Baltic republics and ethnic Germans during World War II.   Katargin was quoted as saying exile will be eliminated as part ofa revision of the entire criminal justice system. The changes willreduce prison sentences and substitute fines, suspended sentencesand other lesser punishments for many offenses.   Since 1980, the proportion of convicted criminals sentenced toimprisonment has dropped from 56 percent to 32 to 34 percent,Katargin was quoted as saying. After the new criminal code ispassed, it is expected to drop to 22 percent to 24 percent,according to the report.   It was not clear from Katargin's statements to the newspaperwhether the reform would end deportation from the country as well asinternal exile.   Nobel Prize-winning author Alexander Solzhenitsyn was stripped ofhis citizenship and deported in 1974, while human rights activistand nuclear scientist Andrei Sakharov was sentenced to internalexile.   Sakharov was exiled from his home in Moscow to the city of Gorkyin January 1980 for criticizing the Soviet intervention inAfghanistan. He was released in December 1986 after receiving atelephone call from Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Exile has often been used as a secondary punishment following aterm of imprisonment.   Dissident Yuri Orlov, who was sent to the United States in 1986as part of the deal that resulted in the Soviets' release of newscorrespondent Nicholas Daniloff and the United States' release ofsuspected spy Gennady Zakharov, spent two years in the Arctic townof Kobyai after completing a term in a labor camp.   Some internal exiles have been sent to a specific area, whileothers are simply banished from living in their hometowns or any ofthe six largest cities in the Soviet Union.   In the past, some were exiled to a specific isolated settlementto find on arrival that the only place to live is a labor camp andthe only food is delivered to the camp mess hall.   More typically, exiles could settle and find work. But forintellectuals, scientists and artists, banishment effectively endedtheir careers.</TEXT></DOC>
