U.S. District Judge Robert Patterson told lawyers for the NewYork area commuter rail lines and the striking machinists at 9:30p.m. that he would not make a decision Saturday, said MTA spokesmanJohn Cunningham.   ``The judge advised the lawyers to be prepared to come backtomorrow sometime after 10 a.m. to possibly answer furtherquestions,'' he said.   Cunningham said it was unclear if the lawyers would be summonedto meet with Patterson on Sunday, but said MTA lawyers were preparedto meet with him.   The MTA, parent company of the Long Island Rail Road and theMetro-North Commuter Railroad, joined by New Jersey Transit, askedPatterson earlier Saturday to issue a temporary restraining orderagainst the threatened sympathy strike, Cunningham said.   Union mechanics and baggage handlers on strike against EasternAirlines have said they plan to mount secondary picket lines atcommuter railroads on Monday morning, particularly in the Northeast.   In Philadelphia, officials of the Southeastern PennsylvaniaTransportation Authority have already obtained a court order aimedat preventing a sympathy strike. SEPTA officials said the authorityhoped its court order, issued Friday night, would keep railroadunion workers on the job even if the Machinists Union sets uppickets Monday.   According to the complaint filed Friday, SEPTA maintained thatunder their contract, its nine railroad unions and their 1,000members can honor picket lines set up by other unions only if thoseunions have contracts with SEPTA.   In Boston, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority said itwas taking steps to assign extra buses Monday morning to help movecommuters in case of a strike. Amtrak, which operates the railsystem on behalf of the MBTA, had no immediate plans to seek a courtorder to stop the expected walkout, a spokeswoman in Washingtonsaid. About 25,000 people travel by MBTA commuter railways on atypical workday.   In their request for an injunction, the New York area transitsystems made an argument similar to SEPTA's, saying the employeesare ``contractually obligated to work and thus must cross any picketline established by the International Association of Machinists,''said Simon Gourdine, director of labor relations at the MTA.   Union leaders at the metropolitan-area rail lines had said theywould honor the picket lines and bring to a halt the trains thatcarry some 320,000 commuters into Manhattan each weekday.   Ed Yule, general chairman of the United Transportation Union forthe LIRR, the nation's largest commuter railroad, said he could notimmediately say how he would advise his workers if Patterson issueda restraining order.   ``It's a union leader's dilemma,'' he said.   Should the strike go on, MTA chairman Robert Kiley predicted``absolute chaos,'' even though officials made plans for such thingsas extra buses and traffic control people to try to handle the crushof commuters.   No transit job actions were reported Saturday.   The LIRR has about 135,000 daily riders, Metro-North carries95,000 people from the northern suburbs and NJ Transit carries about90,000. The Port Authority-Transit Hudson line, or PATH, whichcarries commuters from northern New Jersey into New York City, didnot take part in the request for the injunction, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
