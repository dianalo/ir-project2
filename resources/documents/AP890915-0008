However, U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel also criticizedWatkins on Wednesday as appearing insensitive to the worries ofpeople who live near the Feed Materials Production Center, a uraniumprocessing plant.   ``It's no secret that the Department of Energy has estimated thatit will cost millions, maybe billions, to clean up the site,''Spiegel said, adding that Watkins could have reassured to neighborsconcerned about cleanup costs.   Several businesses near the plant say they interpret thesettlement to mean that they cannot sue to recover from the EnergyDepartment any costs of radioactive materials cleanup on privateproperty. The Energy Department agrees with that assessment, butlawyers for the neighbors disagree.   Spiegel first invited, then last week ordered, Watkins to testifyon that issue, saying a final word was needed from the EnergyDepartment's top official. But Department of Justice lawyers opposedSpiegel's request, saying it was unnecessary and beyond hisauthority.   Justice Department lawyer Richard Stearns said, in papers filedwith Spiegel, the government would appeal if the judge insisted oncompelling testimony from Watkins, a Cabinet officer. Stearns saidthe issue had ``constitutional implications.''   After hearing from both sides Wednesday, Spiegel ruled from thebench that he would decide the issue of cleanup costs on the basisof the case record and would not require Watkins' testimony.   Spiegel said that to do otherwise would probably prompt atime-consuming government appeal that would further delay aresolution for the plant's neighbors.   Spiegel directed lawyers for the government and neighbors to meetand resolve the issue this week.   The 38-year-old plant, about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnti,processes uranium for use elsewhere in making the government'snuclear weapons.   Neighbors of the plant filed their class-action suit in 1985 onbehalf of 14,000 people living within five miles of the plant. Thesuit contended that radioactive pollution from the plant loweredproperty values and caused them emotional distress. The settlementwas reached June 30.   Ruetgers Nease Chemical Co. and the Mobil Corp., which haveoperations near the plant, argued at a hearing on the settlementAug. 23 that its terms would prevent them from suing to recover thecost of any future environmental cleanup on their properties.</TEXT></DOC>
