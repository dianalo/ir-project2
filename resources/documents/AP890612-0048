AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   South Korea needs U.S. troops to defenditself against the communist North and is opposed to any reductionin the American military force, the defense minister said today.   Also today, police arrested a dozen radical students protesting apolice raid on their school to seize pro-North Korea propagandamaterials. Riot police also clashed with student protesters in Pusan.   In another development, President Roh Tae-woo said strikes, highwage increases and other labor problems are undermining the nation'seconomy. He appealed to employers and workers to show restraint andwork together.   The defense minister, Lee Sang-hoon, told the National Assembly'sDefense Committee that the 43,000 U.S. troops based in South Korea``need to be stationed here for a considerable period of time in thefuture.''   Lee was responding to a recent proposal by Sen. Carl Levin,D-Mich., for a reduction in U.S. forces in Korea to about 10,000troops.   Lee said these conditions must be met prior to a U.S. trooppullout:   _North Korea must renounce any plans to unify the Koreanpeninsula by force, and an institution must be established to ensurepeace on the peninsula.   _The military balance on the peninsula must be maintained bysecuring a replacement combat capability corresponding to theAmerican troop withdrawal.   _There must be complete agreement on a U.S. withdrawal reachedthrough full consultations between the U.S. and South Koreangovernments.   Lee said South Korea also would need to boost its militaryspending from 5 percent to 8 percent of its gross national productover a five-year period to build up its own military strength ifU.S. troops leave.   He said the period of active duty for South Korean soldiers wouldneed to be extended from 30 months to 50 months.   Lee said the government was concerned that some``sentimentalist'' South Koreans were advocating reunification andsome ``nationalistic'' citizens were demanding U.S. troops bewithdrawn at the risk of national security.   The minister was referring to dissidents who have called for thereunification of South and North Korea, split since 1945, and apullout of U.S. troops, charging that the American military presenceobstructs reunfication.   U.S. administration officials have said their troops will stay aslong as they are wanted by South Korea.   In Seoul today, 600 Sogang University students tried to march toa police station near their school after a campus rally protesting apre-dawn police raid on their school Friday to seize pro-North Koreapropaganda materials.   About 1,000 riot police with interlocked shields blocked themarch and arrested about a dozen students. No injuries were reported.   As part of a stepped-up crackdown on anti-government movements,police raided the Jesuit-founded school and seized more than 2,000propaganda materials for the 13th World Youth and Student Festivalto be held in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, in July 1-8.   A radical South Korean campus group, the National Council ofStudent Representatives, has vowed to take part in the festival indefiance of a government ban. The festival is a sports and culturalevent mainly for students from the third world and communist nations.   In Pusan, 200 miles southeast of Seoul, 800 university studentswho oppose the government ban on the festival threw rocks at riotpolice, the Yonhap News Agency said. Police fired tear gas to breakup the protests.   No arrests or injuries were reported.   President Roh, in his weekly radio address to the nation, saidthe economy has suffered $4.5 billion in lost production so far thisyear because of labor unrest. He said the losses included $1 billionin lost exports.   Roh urged industrial workers not to make ``excessive'' wagedemands.   He said the competitiveness of Korean exports was decliningbecause of soaring costs and that Japan, Taiwan and other Asiannations were benefitting from Seoul's economic problems.</TEXT></DOC>
