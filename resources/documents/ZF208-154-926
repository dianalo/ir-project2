(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AD/Cycle is the second cornerstone in IBM's implementation of its SystemsApplication Architecture (SAA) strategy.andP;  Unveiled four months afterOfficeVision, AD/Cycle adds the application development (AD) lifecycle to theSAA portfolio.andP;  The AD/Cycle Model (see illustration on next page) includesIBM products and tools from third-party partners, as well as a platform ofservices intended to achieve integration and consistency across all compliantAD products.andM;With AD/Cycle, IBM provides a strategy that endorses CASE, allowing userorganizations to make protected investments in the CASE arena.andP;  No one wantsto build brick walls before the blueprint is finished; mistakes can becostly.andP;  IBM customers who have been reluctant to implement CASE tools cannow rest assured that they will fit into the long-term development framework.andM;The long-awaited IBM Repository Manager plays an important role at theplatform level in allowing AD products to share and integrate components ofthe systems development process.andP;  Ultimately, the repository provides acentral point of storage and control for aU information related toapplications development within an enterprise.andP;  Some initial constraintsshould be noted: The Repository Manager will not be available until June1990, and Version I will only be available on MVS (using DB2 as theunderlying database manager).andM;Those of us disappointed by IBM's continued &quot;host-centricity&quot; approach couldtake the position that, without a 370 running MVS on which to install theRepository Manager, implementing AD/Cycle becomes merely an interestingtheoretical exercise.andP;  However, IBM believes there are benefits to be reapedfrom AD/Cycle even without the repository.andP;  External Source Format (ESF), forexample, provides an interim solution to the repository's integrationfunction with a level of integration between front-end tools and IBM's CrossSystem Product for code generation.andP;  This could be characterized as a&quot;low-end&quot; CASE integration solution within AD/Cycle.andP;  There are also thebenefits of implementing the management architecture, discipline, andstructure of CASE, not to mention the use of current and future CASE toolsthat win be part of AD/Cycle.andM;IBM plans to move the Repository Manager to VM with SQL/DS as theunderpinning, but no timeframe was given.andP;  There will also be an AS/400version in the future as well as transparent services support for the OS/2Extended Edition (EE) platform.andM;OVERVIEW.andP;  Not surprisingly, the AD/Cycle announcement echoed many ofOfficeVision's themes.andM;* AD/Cycle further validates IBM's commitment to implement the SAA strategy.andO;AD/Cycle is an extension of the SAA architecture, and AD/Cycle tools are SAAapplications.andM;* The AD strategy is evolutionary, embracing current tools and methodologiesas well as future ones.andP;  This provides new options while protecting thecustomer's investment in current efforts.andP;  Although some pieces of theAD/Cycle puzzle will not be available until mid-1990 or later, IBM stressedthe customer's ability to get started now by using development products thatare committed to the AD/Cycle framework and to integration with therepository.andM;* The PS/2 running OS/2EE will be the primary window into the AD/Cycleenvironment.andP;  All workstation products will use the SAA cooperative model andthe graphical CUA interface.andM;* Third-party vendors and products can participate through the repository APIand will provide important value and functionality to a customer'simplementation of SAA.andM;* IBM is committed to using AD/Cycle internally as the development foundationfor its own Corporate Information Systems group and its development labsaround the world.andP;  * The AD/Cycle framework is extendable by users anddevelopers.andM;OBJECTIVES.andP;  One obvious reason for implementing an AD/Cycle approach is theneed to improve the productivity of developers while raising the quality ofresulting applications.andP;  This reduces the cost of development and,presumably, the traditional backlogs existing in MIS shops.andP;  Stressed as oneof the most important objectives is the need to provide an applicationsdevelopment environment that is responsive to changes in businessrequirements, and that possesses enough flexibility to adapt to newtechnologies and techniques without starting from scratch.andP;  Another goal isthe ability to support applications too complex to be built by traditionalmeans.andP;  While no one argues with the reality of the problems, the difficultyis solving them.andM;With AD/Cycle, IBM is striving to create an environment in which thedeveloper can use the right tool at the right time for the right task.andP;  Intoday's world, the optimal solution might be to use different tools atdifferent points in an application's lifecycle-one to model the businesssystem, another to design the application and the database, and still anotherto generate the application.andP;  Yet these tools may not be integrated, and thedeveloper must then judge the tradeoffs between optimal integration andoptimal functionality.andP;  Thus, it is often necessary to build an applicationin one technology, using only one set of integrated tools that may not becomplete or the best for each development phase.andM;IBM's goal is to allow the developer to make a decision at the tool levelrather than at the application level, matching the technology to thecomponent.andP;  Each tool chosen can share information and data transparentlywith the other tools.andP;  Another benefit is improved communication betweenbusiness and data processing analysts, making the handoff between these twoparticipants in the development process easier and more effective.andM;As we stated, the repository is a core service necessary to achieve IBM'sgoal.andP;  Each tool (from IBM or third-party vendors) interfaces to therepository, via the API, storing information about the application in therepository according to the AD Information Model.andP;  Other tools that interfaceto the repository can then access and use this information.andP;  Thus, theorganization gains control over the applications development process, and alltypes of application objects become reusable across the enterprise.andM;IBM stated that it will publish the repository API, allowing any vendor toparticipate in AD/Cycle.andP;  The operative concept here is that integration ofapplication development tools is not implemented on a tool-to-tool basis buton a tool-to-repository basis.andM;Another important perspective from IBM is that the development environmentwill vary by platform.andP;  Not all tools will necessarily be available on aflfour SAA platforms.andP;  However, any application developed will be executable onall four platforms.andM;REPOSITORY MANAGER.andP;  As we have mentioned, the repository is intended to bebroader in scope than just storing information about applicationsdevelopment.andP;  The ultimate goal is to store all information about both thebusiness model and the data processing operation in the repository.andP;  As anexample, IBM issued a statement of direction that it intends to storeinformation about network configuration in the repository and generate NCPand VTAM definitions from it.andM;Repository Manager/MVS is a DB2 application, and it runs under TSO.andP;  It isimportant to understand that the repository is only active during thedevelopment phase of an application.andP;  It is not intended to replace existingproduction data dictionaries or catalogs, nor will it interface withproduction applications.andM;The Repository Manager uses an IBM-supplied entity-relationship (ER) modelfor enterprise modeling.andP;  Therefore, the repository will contain informationabout both entities (e.g., customers, employees, programmers, programs,products, parts, etc.) and the relationships between entities (e.g., aprogrammer codes a program, a customer buys a product).andP;  Entities haveattributes, and relationships have properties.andP;  The ER model can be extended,and IBM will provide guidelines for doing so.andM;The Repository Manager provides three views of repository information.andP;  Theconceptual view contains information that is common across all tools andfunctions within the repository.andP;  The logical view is some subset of theconceptual view that is accessible to a specific tool.andP;  The storage view isthe physical representation of repository information in DB2.andP;  Information isstored in the repository by application development tools that interface tothe repository, by repository dialogs, or by the repository batch loadfacility.andM;The Repository Manager will also provide for policies that can be associatedwith repository information.andP;  These are used to define rules for security,integrity, derivation of data values, and triggers (to support processingdriven by changes in repository information).andP;  Policies can berepository-wide (defined at the conceptual level) or tool-specific.andM;The Repository Manager will offer object services for higher-level access toand manipulation of repository information.andP;  The developer will be able todefine both objects and methods, although this is not a true object-orientedapproach.andP;  For example, there is no explicit notion of inheritance, classes,or subclasses.andP;  Since object-level data (versus ER-level data) can be storedoutside the repository (i.e., outside the DB2 repository database), objectservices extends the control of the Repository Manager to any relevantinformation anywhere in the system (e.g., text documents, programs, etc.).andM;The Repository Manager and the repository itself will always reside on thehost, although IBM plans to move some front-end components of the RepositoryManager to the workstation, beginning with the second release.andM;The Repository Manager interacts with ISPF (dialog manager), ISPF/PDF (texteditor), SDF II (screen definition facility), DCF (report output formatting),and DB2 (physically manages repository information).andM;APIs.andP;  IBM has chosen to separate the repository interface into an API and aCPI (a subset of the API).andP;  CPI documentation will be published in the firstquarter of 1990; specs for the full set of API verbs will be available withthe first release of Repository Manager/ MVS  June 1990).andM;Migration Tools.andP;  A Dictionary Model Transformer will assist users in movinginformation from an IMS DB/DC Data Dictionary to the repository.andP;  TheRepository Manager will have access at some level to existing DB2applications and catalogs.andP;  IBM is also committed to a bridge from DBRAD(Database Relational Application Directory) to the repository.andM;OTHER IBM PRODUCTS.andP;  In addition to announcing new language support for PL/I(PL/I has been added to the SAA CPI), IBM introduced several new or enhancedAD products.andM;DevelopMate.andP;  Designed for use by the business professional, this new productfalls into the enterprise modeling component of AD/Cycle.andP;  It is, by the way,the only IBM offering at the front end of the life cycle.andP;  As a cooperativeapplication, the front end will run on OS/2EE and the host portion on therepository platform (initially MVS only, since the Repository Manager is arequired underpinning).andP;  DevelopMate will be available next December.andM;With DevelopMate, a business analyst can interactively define and prototypean enterprise model in entity-relationship terms.andP;  Or the analyst can accessand extend a business model created by another front-end tool and stored inthe repository.andP;  Extensions include the definition of rules, screens,queries, and reports.andP;  All modeling data is stored in the repository and canbe shared by other AD/Cycle tools.andM;DevelopMate creates a prototype application (on the host) directly from thebusiness model.andM;Cross System Product (CSP).andP;  CSP is an important core tool in AD/Cycle.andP;  AsIBM's 4GL offering, CSP is the SAA application generator tool.andP;  Version 3Release 3, available in June 1990, adds a CUA-compliant OS/2EE workstationfront end for designing and modifying CSP applications.andP;  This is not acooperative application since a host 370 is still necessary for testing andcode generation, with explicit utilities required to port the resultingdesign to the host.andP;  IBM plans to move the testing and generation facilitiesto the workstation with cooperative library services provided by the ADplatform.andM;A CSP-developed application can be deployed on any of the four SAA platforms.andO;Therefore, although CSP development will not run on the AS/ 400, resultingapplications can be executed in this environment.andP;  Implementing full CSP onthe workstation in the future will eliminate the need for testing andgeneration on a 370 of AS/400 applications.andM;CSP 3.3 also includes Cobol generation, the ability to define applicationsfor execution in the IMS environment, long names, and SQL extensions.andM;As an AD/Cycle tool deliverer, IBM will interface CSP to the repositorywithin a year, providing additional object and method definitions.andP;  IBM'slong-term strategy for CSP is to assist the developer in generatingdistributed, cooperative applications, including enforcing CUA compliance.andO;Knowledge Base.andP;  IBM very quietly mentioned a future knowledge base product.andO;The Integrated Reasoning Shell (TIRS) has been available as a Systemsintegration Offering from the Systems Integration Division (SID) since March.andO;IBM plans to formally announce this as a program product and an AD/Cycleknowledge base tool by the end of the year.andP;  An internally-developed generalapplication development tool, TIRS runs on OS/2EE and AIX as developmentplatforms, generating PL/I or C code.andP;  TIRS-developed applications can beported across SAA environments, including OS/2EE, IMS, CICS, TSO, and CMS aswell as AIX.andP;  An AS/400 runtime library is also planned.andP;  IBM plans to useESF and Knowledge Tool as bridges to a future version of TIRS.andM;Test Tools.andP;  IBM announced two new workstation-based tools for testingapplications.andP;  Software Analysis Test Tool, available June 1990, providestest coverage measurement and analysis support in the MVS environment forCobol and PL/I programs.andP;  Workstation Interactive Test Tool, coming in March,is an OS/2EE application to capture test data and allow the developer toreplay and validate tests as an application is changed.andM;Database Enhancements.andP;  IBM made a number of database-related announcements,but these were given less of the spotlight than AD/Cycle.andP;  However, it isimportant to note that the data management products form one of the keyfoundations for AD/Cycle, and, in fact, for SAA as a whole.andM;DB2 2.2 is available now.andP;  It is earlierandM;than expected.andM;* Query Management Facility (QMF) 2A, in addition to other enhancements, willoffer query access to remote DB2 data, access to ER information in therepository via queries and reports, and an SAA callable interface.andM;* Data Extract (DXT) 2.4 offers several enhancements, the most interesting ofwhich is a new module that runs on Digital's VAX/VMS, DXT/Dl.andP;  ThroughDXT/D1, DXT users on MVS can extract data from Oracle, Ingres, Rdb, and RMSfiles on the VAX.andP;  This is IBM's first software offering for the VAX,indicating that IBM is weB aware that access to data is a critical part ofthe solution users need.andM;VENDOR TOOLS.andP;  Playing a prominent role as IBM partners in implementingAD/Cycle are three CASE vendors: Bachman Information Systems, IndexTechnology, and KnowledgeWare.andP;  This is the first time IBM has shared thestage with its partners on such a broad announcement.andP;  IBM has establishedmarketing and development agreements with these vendors, and the company hasalso taken a minority equity interest in each.andM;The close alliance with three important CASE vendors is necessary to give IBMa presence in the front end of the application development life cycle.andP;  IBMadmits that in terms of front-end tools, it had &quot;almost none,&quot; prompting itto search out the best as AD/Cycle partners.andP;  IBM will sell all threevendors' products and will assist customers in using them appropriately(although it is not clear how IBM salespeople will differentiate them for thecustomer).andM;All three CASE vendors are committed to OS/2EE, CUA front-end platforms, aninterface to the Repository Manager, and DB2.andP;  Index will ship its firstOS/2EE product in mid-90.andP;  KnowledgeWare will roll out its workstationproducts on OS/2EE over the first six months of 1990.andM;IBM's strong support for CASE, and for these three vendors in particular,will go a long way to making this technology a safe choice for theapplications development process.andM;SERVICE OFFERINGS.andP;  IBM's Systems Integration Division (SID) plans toestablish an AD practice in which it will act as the prime or generalcontractor to customize the AD/Cycle strategy for the customer.andP;  At theservice end, IBM has announced partnerships with four service vendors whowill coordinate the delivery of service to the customer: Cap Gemini, ComputerPower Group, Computer Task Group, and GE Consulting.andM;WHAT'S MISSING.andP;  A distributed Repository Manager and the addition ofend-user computing tools to AD/Cycle were not mentioned in the announcement.andO;IBM has also not articulated the obvious linkage between AD/Cycle as theprovider of SAA applications and data definitions and OfficeVision as thedelivery vehicle.andM;As with the OfficeVision announcement, there was no mention of Unix.andO;According to Earl Wheeler, IBM vice president and general manager,Programming Systems, there are two families within IBM-SAA and Unix-and whatis important to one might not be to the other.andP;  IBM is architecting its Unixstrategy with the realization that it must be consistent with the rest of theUnix environment.andM;CPI-C is still not a generally available part of SAA.andP;  This makes thingstough for the application developer.andM;FUTURES.andP;  A few of the enhancements to AD/Cycle that IBM plans to provideinclude: documentation support, the ability to generate an inventory ofreusable application components from the repository, knowledge-basedgenerators (such as TIRS), significant enhancements to library services, andrepository-driven impact analysis tools and version management to help withmaintenance.andP;  A long-term goal is support for restructuring and reverseengineering of some existing application components, allowing skilleddevelopers to do mapping of design-level information into the AD/Cycle model.andO;This will enhance the maintenance of older applications.andP;  RELATED NOTES.andP;  IBMdid, in fact, ship its first OfficeVision products on schedule in September.andO;These include Release I for both the OS/2EE LAN and MVS.andP;  The only exceptionwas the DOS requestor software.andP;  Delayed due to late-breaking bugs, the DOSrequestor feature will ship a few weeks late.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
