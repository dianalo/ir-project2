And this year the number arriving in the United States isexpected to top 100,000 for the first time since 1982.   Another 14 million to 20 million people are refugees withintheir own countries.   But the numbers are approximate, because in many places, nocareful figures are kept and there are many definitions of who is arefugee.   ``These are not numbers,'' said Roger P. Winter, director of thecommittee, in a statement on its report. ``They are people. Eachone of these 14.4 million represents an individual human tragedy.''   The committee is a private group financed by foundations,churches and contributions from individuals.   The biggest new groups described in its annual report, madepublic this week, are:   _335,000 who fled to Ethiopia when a long-simmering revoltflared up last summer in Somalia, on the northeast tip of Africa.About 600,000 people have been displaced within Somalia, a countrybigger than France and with a population of about 8 million.   _Almost 250,000 Mozambicans who fled a 14-year-old revoltagainst their Communist government by the Renamo guerrillamovement, which has support in South Africa. The commitee says 1.15million Mozambicans have now gone to other countries and 2 millionof the country's 15 million people have been violently uprootedwithin its borders.   _150,000 refugees from a civil war between non-Moslems and theIslamic government of Sudan. They have moved eastward intoEthiopia, one  world's poorest countries, bringing the totalSudanese there to 350,000. About 2 million peopleportedto have lost their homes in Sudan. The y has 24 millioninhabitants and more than twice the area of Egypt, its northernneighbor.   The largest number of refugees comes from Afghion. Most are in Pakistan,which shelters the world'sbiggest refugee population. Another 2 mill withintheir homeland.   Palestinians _ 2.p the second largest group.Ethiopia, to which 700,000 refugees have fled, has seen about 2.1million of its own people flee abroad.   Refugees differ widely. Most of the Afghans have fled in thelast eight or nine years. Many Palestinians left more than 40 yearsago when Israel became a state, ad their children andgrandchildtill considered refugees.   The United Nations High Commissioner for RefugeeserreHocke, praised countries which have taken in refugees assafeguarding the unity of the family.   U.S. tate James A. Baker III told Congress lastmonth that he is planning to ask for another $100 miearfor refugees, in addition to the $412 millie.But for the following year the Bush administration has sought a cutin spending.   Bakerwill complete a review of its refugeeprograms soon after May 1.   Just before leaving office in January, President Reagan raisedto 25,000 the number of rgees from the Soviet Union and easternEurope titted into this country during the year that willend Sept. 30. That will leave 7,000 fewer poss for peoplefrom Vietnam, but almost 40,000 plwill still be available forthem.   Hocke, writing in a specn of his agency's publication`'' said the most natural solution for refugees is tosend them home when conditions change enough so that they arewelcome. He called attention to those repatriated last year toEthiopia, Uganda and El Salvador.   The U.S. committee reported only about 280,000 voluntaryrepatriati for the year, tto Uganda andBurundi in southern Africa.</TEXT></DOC>
