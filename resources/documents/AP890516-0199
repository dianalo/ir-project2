But student leaders said they rejected Zhao's offer and wouldpress on with their protests for democracy.   As Chinese leaders held a historic summit with Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev in the Great Hall of the People on Tuesday,protesters surged onto its steps. The crowd, including students ona 4-day-old hunger strike, turned the adjoining 100-acre squareinto a vast parade ground.   Hundreds of police and soldiers guarded the hall entrances, butno police were seen in the square.   The month-old student campaign for democracy became a massmovement as teachers, doctors, reporters, government employees,workers and others who had cheered from the sidelines took upbanners and marched.   Not since the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when youths mobilizedby Mao Tse-tung ousted alleged rightists, has there been such amass challenge to the Communist establishment. This time, however,it is coming from outside the party.   ``We cannot fail to come out at such a critical moment,'' said aQinghua University teacher.   After midnight, Zhao sent a message to the students from theparty leadership saying it affirmed their patriotic spirit incalling for greater democracy and attacking official corruption.   He also said the government would not punish them and would``work out concrete measures to enhance democracy and law, opposecorruption, build an honest and clean government and expandopenness.''   The message, reported by the official news agency Xinhua,addressed key demands of the students, but he did not accede to ademand for talks with officials to be broadcast live.   Zhao promised only that leaders would talk ``with students andother people at various levels through multiple channels after thestudents return to campuses.''   Student leaders received the document from party officialsduring the night and rejected it after a meeting, said Cheng Zhenof Beijing Normal University.   She said it did not adequately address the question of adialogue with the students and did not thoroughly reject thegovernment's previous stance that students want to put the countryin turmoil.   Students planned another mass march on Wednesday afternoon.   Hundreds conducted an overnight sit-in outside Communist Partyheadquarters, led in occasional chants of ``Li Peng, come out!'' bya Buddhist monk in a saffron robe waving a small bell.   Many Chinese speculated the protest would force the completeretirement of 84-year-old senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who in 1987stepped down from all posts except head of the Central MilitaryCommission.   ``If (the leaders) fear the people, they can't represent them,''said Song Lou, a teacher at the Workers' Movement Institute.   In a meeting with Gorbachev, however, Zhao said: ``We still needhis wisdom and experience.''   A doctor at the Beijing Emergency Center said early Wednesdayabout 600 of the more than 3,000 hunger strikers had beenhospitalized since the strike began Saturday but some laterreturned to the square. He said some cases were serious, includingone student he treated for heart failure.   Twelve students also stopped taking liquids Tuesday.   Classmates laid them on blankets just off the square, alreadyclosed to traffic by the crowd.   ``We cannot die today,'' proclaimed a banner held over theirheads.   In the coastal city of Shanghai, more than 4,000 students held asit-in at city headquarters to show support for the Beijing hungerstrikers, Xinhua reported.   Xinhua and the TV news also carried unusually complete reportsof the Beijing protest, including the support shown by the public.   A high party official, Yan Mingfu, visited the strikers and saidover a student-controlled loudspeaker he sympathized with them, buturged them to go home and give the government more time. Severalstudent leaders agreed.   ``Yan is somebody we can trust,'' said Wu'er Kaixi of the UnitedAssociation of Beijing Universities, an independent student groupformed to lead the movement. The hunger strikers voted to stay,with only 56 dissenting.   The presidents of Beijing colleges issued a letter read over thepublic address system that urged the students to end the protestbut also asked the government to meet the demands.   Students say they will not leave the square until the governmentapologizes for an April 26 editorial in the People's Daily thataccused them of plotting against the state.   They had expected the government to capitulate quickly, but thenprepared for a long protest.   With public donations, they bought umbrellas and hats to shelterprotesters. They organized trucks to bring water and take awaygarbage, and kept paths clear for the trucks and ambulances.   Hunger strikers sprawled listlessly on blankets surrounded by awall of fellow students holding hands.   Hundreds of thousands of non-students roamed the square andnearby avenues. Marchers included people from official media,out-of-town schools and hospitals, the state-run airline and laborfederation. Artists, movie makers and hastily formed organizationscalling themselves the ``Beijing Citizens Support Group'' and``Unemployed Youth Support Group'' joined the demonstration.   The Peking Union Medical College set up a tent and administeredsalt and sugar water intravenously to more than 100 students.   Dr. Ma Sui said most fasters could continue three or four moredays, ``but after that I fear they will be in danger of theirlives.''</TEXT></DOC>
