Bill Clinton sought the Democratic nomination fora fifth term Tuesday, and Republicans decided a rancorousgubernatorial primary that pitted a former utility chief against asheriff-turned-congressman.   In Kentucky, former Louisville mayor Harvey Sloane battled stateschools Superintendent John Brock for the Democratic nomination tomeet Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell. McConnell faced only tokenopposition in the GOP primary, from perennial candidate Tommy Klein.   Long-time Democratic congressmen in both states faced spiritedchallenges.   In the 1st District of northeast Arkansas, Rep. Bill Alexander,a 22-year veteran of Congress, faced Osceola attorney Mike Gibson,a political newcomer with strong business backing.   In the Louisville area, 10-term incumbent Rep. Romano Mazzolicampaigned without money from political action committees againstformer television newsman Jeffrey Hutter and Alderman Paul Bather.   Clinton's main challenger, Tom McRae, former president of theWinthrop Rockefeller Foundation, lagged in public polls, and thegovernor hoped to gain a majority vote and avoid a June 12 runoff.The other Democratic candidates were Joe Holmes of Pine Bluff,Jerry Tolliver of North Little Rock, Cyrus Young of Fayettevilleand O.O. ``Woodrow'' Wilson of North Little Rock.   The GOP primary featured a bitter rivalry between Rep. TommyRobinson, former police chief and sheriff from Pulaski County, andSheffield Nelson, former head of Arkla Inc., the major natural gasutility in Arkansas. Both were Democrats until last year.</TEXT><TEXT>   Sen. David Pryor, an Arkansas Democrat, had no primaryopposition and will face only a write-in foe in November.   Arkansas' Republican campaign for governor focused on a businessdeal between Arkla Inc. and Arkoma Production Co., owned byNelson's friend Jerry Jones, the Dallas Cowboys owner who grew upwith Robinson in North Little Rock.   In 1982, Arkla sold a half-interest in gas drilling leases toArkoma for $15 million. After Arkoma spent $35 million more ondrilling and other costs, Arkla bought back its leases in 1986along with the rest of Arkoma for $174.8 million.   Robinson, 48, called the deal sleazy and severed his financialties and friendship with Jones. Jones' 22-year-old daughter,Charlotte, quit her $60,000 a year job as administrator ofRobinson's congressional office after Robinson began criticizingher father.   Nelson's feud with his mentor at Arkla, W.R. ``Witt'' Stephens,spilled over into the campaign. Stephens' sister-in-law, Mary AnneStephens, managed Robinson's campaign. Her husband, Jack Stephens,and Stephens Inc., the investment firm run by the brothers, weremajor contributors to Robinson's campaign.   Clinton, 43, was the nation's youngest governor when he wasfirst elected in 1978. He lost his bid for re-election in 1980, butwas elected again in 1982, 1984 and 1986, when the two-year termfor governor was doubled.   Clinton, frequently mentioned as a potential presidentialcandidate, became the object of jokes in 1988 because of hismeandering speech introducing another candidate for that office _Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis. Clinton was supposed to talkfor 15 minutes but spoke for more than twice that long.   In Kentucky, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson backed Brock, butdisagreements between the two surfaced last week when Brock decidednot to follow Wilkinson's advice to borrow $250,000 for alast-minute television blitz. Wilkinson said that all but dashedBrock's chances and disassociated himself from the campaign.   Alexander, 52, claimed that rich landowners in his nativeMississippi County and big oil companies bankrolled Gibson'campaign. In a whirlwind push the last two months of the campaign,the incumbent portrayed himself as a ``child of the Delta'' andboasted of bringing $100 million in federal aide to the 24-countydistrict.   Gibson, 43, derided what he said was the incumbent'sineffectiveness in Congress. He noted that Alexander had neverchaired or co-chaired a major congressional committee.   The main issue in Mazzoli's district was whether the incumbent,first elected to the seat in 1970, had done enough for Louisvillein his two decades in office. Mazzoli was co-author with Sen. AlanSimpson, R-Wyo., of the 1986 immigration reform law.</TEXT></DOC>
