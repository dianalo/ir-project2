Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> BOSTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Last August, as Republicans were starting to batter Michael Dukakis over the Pledge of Allegiance, Dukakis media adviser Scott Miller suggested having Sen. John Glenn, the war hero and astronaut, make a commercial answering the charges. Sen. Glenn was eager to do it.    The idea was rejected, reportedly by Mr. Dukakis himself.    A few weeks later, Mr. Dukakis's aides planned an economic-populism offensive to portray Vice President George Bush as the candidate of privilege.    Gov. Dukakis not only rejected the idea but also angrily told his advisers never to put the phrase &quot;country club&quot; into a speech again.    Going into the second presidential debate, aides primed Gov. Dukakis -- portrayed by the Republicans as soft on crime -- to assert aggressively that the mugging of his father and the hit-and-run killing of his only brother exposed him intimately to the personal tragedy of crime.    But aides watching him that night were, as a senior staff member put it, &quot;astonished at his answers.&quot; The first question -- about what he would do if his wife were raped and murdered -- sent him off on an abstract discourse that ended with his calling for a hemispheric summit conference on drugs.    These are only a handful of the missed opportunities for a campaign that only 90 days ago showed enormous promise. &quot;A lot of it was Dukakis's own fault,&quot; says James Reichley, a Republican senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. &quot;He's a pretty arrogant person and wasn't able to adapt.&quot;    This election was always going to be much tougher for the Democrats than Mr. Dukakis's midsummer 17-point lead in the polls suggested. Mr. Bush had an easier route to the nomination and more experienced strategists. And Mr. Dukakis ran against the vice president of a popular national leader, Ronald Reagan, in a time of peace and prosperity. There was no national groundswell for sweeping policy change.    Still, the state of the race on election day underscores the opportunity Mr. Dukakis had for winning the White House for his party. The Democrats, though long-shot underdogs, do still have a slim chance. In recent days, both the crowds and the polls have improved for Mr. Dukakis. The fact that he has a chance at all highlights Mr. Bush's own weaknesses. Most analysts agree that the GOP candidate would have been vulnerable to a strong Democratic attack. Even if Mr. Dukakis is somehow able to pull off a victory today, it will be in spite of -- rather than because of -- many of his strategic and tactical decisions.    As Dukakis insiders re-examine the governor's 19-month odyssey, the images that linger are of a candidate possessed of little understanding of the voters or the election and, more important, of a candidate offering no compelling message or rationale for his campaign. Mr. Dukakis:   --Resisted every effort to get him to leave the relative security of his State House office in August to campaign outside Massachusetts at a time when the Republicans were on the offensive.    --Sternly lectured his aides that he would not engage in negative campaigning even as his lead was seeping away, and rejected response after response to Mr. Bush's attacks.    --Delayed for months the important defense speeches that might have inoculated the candidate from charges that he wasn't fit to be commander in chief.    --And failed to resolve a struggle among powerful aides that paralyzed the campaign at crucial moments.    The result has been a campaign that never understood the demands of a general-election battle, that underestimated Mr. Bush and the ferocity of the campaign he would wage, and that seriously miscalculated the effect of sustained negative attacks. The Dukakis camp failed to reach out to other Democrats and failed to establish its candidate as a legitimate leader.    &quot;They weren't prepared to run a presidential campaign,&quot; says Carl Pinkele, a political scientist at Ohio Wesleyan University. &quot;They had a candidate who for the first time in his life had a slow learning curve. They didn't realize that the election wasn't a Harvard seminar and that the opposition wasn't going to take any prisoners.&quot; While remaining upbeat about his chances to win, Dukakis himself has acknowledged that he may have erred in not responding more swiftly and strongly to Republican attacks.    The Democrats shouldn't have had any doubts about the GOP's intentions. Bush aides freely acknowledged plans for a tough and negative campaign. Starting immediately after the Democrats' triumphant Atlanta convention, Mr. Bush and his lieutenants systematically portrayed Mr. Dukakis as a liberal out of sync with American politics, contemptuous of the flag and of simple patriotic gestures, permissive on social questions, and weak on foreign affairs. Why didn't the Democrats respond?    Aides say Mr. Dukakis, apparently content with the case he had made in Atlanta about his competence being the most important factor in the campaign, believed that the attacks were so patently wrong that they wouldn't stick to him. Kirk O'Donnell, who joined the campaign in the summer, wrote riposte after riposte, only to have each rejected. The Dukakis camp produced television commercials on the failures of the federal prison-furlough program -- commercials explicitly designed to counter GOP attacks on Mr. Dukakis over Willie Horton, the convicted murderer who brutalized a Maryland couple while on a furlough from a Massachusetts prison. But Mr. Dukakis wouldn't allow the spots to be aired.    While refusing to play defense, aides say, the candidate was reluctant to play offense, too. As in the primaries -- when, for instance, Rep. Richard Gephardt attacked him during South Dakota's contest -- Mr. Dukakis wouldn't respond by counterattacking Mr. Gephardt personally. In one internal debate over Mr. Bush's withering offensive, Mr. Dukakis dismissed urgings that he, too, had to get down and dirty, according to one top aide. &quot;I'm not going to do this,&quot; the aide remembers him arguing. &quot;How many times do I have to tell you? That's not me.&quot;    At one point, even Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, Mr. Dukakis's running mate, called and urged the candidate to go on the attack. Still, he resisted.    Nor would Mr. Dukakis deviate from an agreement he and campaign manager Susan Estrich reached in early July to permit him to spend several days a week at his desk in the governor's office. By August, when the GOP assaults began in earnest, Ms. Estrich was repeatedly urging him to return to the hustings. The governor, though, was troubled about the state budget and worried that the legislature would override a line-item veto he had made on the disbursement of excess revenue from the state lottery. He also wanted to take a last tour around Massachusetts to see state agencies and officials.    But while he lingered in Massachusetts, his rivals not only dominated the evening news but also set the agenda for virtually the entire general-election campaign.    A major problem, aides and other observers say, was that neither the campaign nor the candidate had made the transition from the primaries to the general election. In the primaries, Mr. Dukakis's last rival was a candidate of the left, Jesse Jackson. But in the general election Mr. Dukakis -- the product of a Democrat-dominated state and unaccustomed to running against a Republican -- was sure to be challenged from the right on economic and national-security questions.    To blunt such attacks, some Dukakis aides prepared a vigorous defense speech for early July. But the speech didn't get delivered until mid-September. &quot;You can't cede the defense issue if you're trying to become commander in chief,&quot; one aide says now. &quot;You can't say you'd rather talk about job training. We didn't even try to look qualified to be president.&quot;    Other major campaign speeches had the same fate. Some of them weren't delivered until last month, when it was clear Mr. Bush had defined Mr. Dukakis before Mr. Dukakis had a chance to.    As Mr. Dukakis swiftly plummeted in the polls, he finally summoned back longtime political aide John Sasso, despite his own and campaign chairman Paul Brountas's worries that they would be criticized for the move. Mr. Sasso had left the campaign during the primaries almost a year earlier after distributing a videotape that forced the withdrawal, amid charges of plagiarism, of Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware.    Hours before Mr. Sasso met with the governor to get the official offer to return, he asked Hank Morris, a New York political consultant, to read him over the telephone a 30-page memo Mr. Morris had prepared for the campaign. In his memo, which turned out to be a roadmap for the final weeks of the campaign, Mr. Morris contended that &quot;there is nothing unpresidential or negative&quot; about making Mr. Bush's and the GOP's errors one of the &quot;central campaign themes.&quot; He argued that &quot;the campaign cannot be allowed to be a Republican monologue&quot; about Mr. Dukakis and his record. And he urged the campaign to frame the issue in terms of &quot;the cleavage between us and them.&quot;    The candidate continued to resist, but Mr. Sasso pressed. On Labor Day, Mr. Dukakis finally blamed the Republicans for a &quot;middle-class squeeze.&quot; Then, uncomfortable with the theme, he softened it. Gradually, the rhetoric became sharper again, though never as sharp as many advisers, both inside and outside the campaign, would have liked.    Returning after nearly a year, Mr. Sasso found a campaign that was parochial, isolated, and -- worst of all -- drifting. The Republicans' general-election strategy was set by June, the Democrats' was still unformed. There was insufficient opposition research as well as thin polling data. Mr. Sasso tightened his grip on the campaign, causing bruised feelings with Ms. Estrich, whose daily 9 a.m. senior staff meetings eventually were supplanted by Mr. Sasso's 8 a.m. sessions.    Throughout the fall, the campaign's television effort reflected Mr. Dukakis's own dislike of media politics. &quot;He's never been comfortable with commercials,&quot; says Ken Swope, a longtime Dukakis media adviser. Mr. Dukakis's attitude sharply contrasted with Mr. Bush's willingness to be packaged by GOP strategist Roger Ailes. &quot;A guy like Ailes wouldn't prevail with him,&quot; Mr. Swope says of the governor. Mr. Dukakis &quot;just wouldn't agree.&quot;    An executive committee of top advisers was supposed to make the key media decisions. The group, though, seemed unable to come to any real decisions, paralyzing the advertising effort. Scripts were produced by the bushel, but almost all were rejected. Don Payne, another Dukakis media aide, says that trying to get a decision out of campaign higher-ups was &quot;like a one-sided tennis game. We'd hit the ball, but it never came back.&quot;    Finally Mr. Sasso turned to David D'Alessandro, the man responsible for John Hancock Financial Services' widely praised &quot;real people&quot; ads but someone who had no experience in presidential campaigns. Mr. D'Alessandro came up with a series of advertisements showing cynical, shirt-sleeved political operatives sitting around a table packaging a candidacy. These spots were roundly criticized, even within the Dukakis camp, as being too confusing and obscure. &quot;It's our packagers talking about their packagers,&quot; Mr. Swope says.    Eventually, a number of state campaign coordinators rebelled and ordered up their own ads. Some were effective, but the result was little coordination between the images Mr. Dukakis projected on the stump and those reflected in the ads. &quot;Now it's every state coordinator for himself,&quot; says Mr. Payne. &quot;The overall message is all over the place.&quot;    The deadliest television image of all came the evening of the Los Angeles debate when Mr. Dukakis, who was sick and who had slept for three hours that afternoon, mishandled the crime question. Time and again he had rehearsed an answer referring to the victims in his family and asserting to Mr. Bush, &quot;I don't need any lectures from you about crime.&quot;    He didn't deliver the line or even refer to his father or brother. Then he drifted through the rest of the session, discarding his plans as he went.    Aides say the candidate also had intended a touch of self-depreciating humor to soften his image. At one point, he was supposed to say, &quot;Some people say I'm arrogant, but I know better than that.&quot; At another he was planning to say: &quot;Mr. Bush talks about giving the country back to the little guy. I am that man.&quot; He never used the lines, although -- like the planned answer to the question about crime -- he used them in subsequent speeches.    Nor did the governor follow his strategic plan. In his first opportunity to discuss economic questions, he was supposed to portray Mr. Bush's plan to reduce the capital-gains tax as a sop for the rich; instead, he rambled on about Mr. Bush's spending priorities. And he was supposed to conclude with a set of remarks on making America No. 1 again; instead, he talked about how he and his wife appreciated the kindnesses that had been shown them in months of campaigning.    His aides had seen signs that a disaster was imminent. In one of the candidate's final preparation sessions, one aide said Mr. Dukakis should go after Mr. Bush aggressively. But Mr. Dukakis balked, insisting that a positive tone was preferable. &quot;He really wants to go in there and be kinder and gentler,&quot; a frustrated aide said, alluding ironically to Vice President Bush's campaign rhetoric.    After Mr. Dukakis left the meeting, Ms. Estrich even convened an emergency session to discuss how to disabuse him of his soft tone. Ultimately, the group thought Mr. Sasso had persuaded him to take a tougher line -- only to be disappointed once the debate began.    But, as far as the debates were concerned, the missed opportunities began long before that night in Los Angeles. Bush campaign chairman James Baker had insisted on a format that proved the most rigid in the history of televised presidential debates, one that precluded follow-up questions and virtually any give-and-take between the candidates. Mr. Baker bluffed his Dukakis counterpart, Mr. Brountas, with the almost certainly hollow threat that the vice president wouldn't debate at all unless the Republicans got their way. The Dukakis camp gave in, agreeing to a format that helped the carefully rehearsed Mr. Bush, who, most agree, is not as quick on his feet as Mr. Dukakis.    Throughout the campaign, Mr. Dukakis has been struggling to recover -- from the torpor of August, from his poor performance in the second debate, from the disorder of his campaign. In the final days of the race, he finally seemed to reach his stride, connecting with his audience on economic themes and embracing the notion of being a liberal in the tradition of John Kennedy, Harry Truman and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Ironically, it was the very populism he resisted for so long that moved voters. Unless he pulls off a little miracle today, his campaign is likely to go down in the annals of might-have-beens. And if he loses, says Mr. Reichley of Brookings, it will have been Mr. Dukakis himself who &quot;kicked it away.&quot;    ---                     Dukakis's Slippage    &quot;If the election were being held today, would you vote for...?&quot;             7/23-25    8/20-22    10/14-16     11/1-5  Dukakis        51%        40%         38%        43%  Bush           34%        47%         55%        48%    THE WALL STREET JOURNAL/NBC NEWS POLL</TEXT></DOC>
