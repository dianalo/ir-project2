Hudson (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP T PHG </CO><IN> TNM TEL </IN><DATELINE> LONDON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A closely watched marriage of two telecommunications giants showed signs of strain, as American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and NV Philips revised their four-year-old European partnership.    The communications and electronics concerns said ATandamp;T agreed to buy an extra 10% stake from Philips in their ATandamp;T-Philips Telecommunications BV venture. The companies wouldn't comment on the sale price, but analysts put it at less than 90 million guilders ($48.6 million). The move, jointly announced yesterday, puts ATandamp;T firmly in control of a 50-50 partnership that makes telephone exchanges and communications transmission equipment for sale outside North America.    The companies said they are recruiting more European partners for the venture, a move that could lead to Philips further lowering its stake. Robert Dalziel, president of ATandamp;T's European operations, said Stet S.p.A., Italy's state-owned electronics holding company, is among the potential partners. He said a Stet investment would be tied to the venture entering Italy's growing telecommunications market.    The steps follow four years of red ink and struggling sales efforts at the ATandamp;T-Philips alliance, industry analysts said, and may presage further changes. &quot;The plain fact is the ATandamp;T-Philips joint venture hasn't achieved very much&quot; for Philips, said William Dixon, a London-based analyst with PaineWebber Securities Inc.    But Philips and ATandamp;T billed the measures as strengthening rather than dismantling their partnership. Despite the talks with Stet, the companies said they haven't decided whether a Stet stake -- or that of any other additional partner -- would come out of Philips's or ATandamp;T's stake.    It will be up to ATandamp;T to decide which company's stake is lowered if more partners join the venture, said W.B. Marx, an executive vice president of ATandamp;T's Network Systems group in New York. The reduced stake of Philips, he said, reflects the Dutch company's desire to concentrate on its electronics businesses, rather than the business of selling phone equipment to telephone companies.    Because ATandamp;T has modified many of its products to fit European telecommunications standards, Mr. Marx said the venture will start selling ATandamp;T's full line of products for phone companies, including transmission equipment, copper and fiber optic cable.    Based in Hilversum, the Netherlands, the joint venture was the first of a crop of mergers and alliances that have reshaped the world telecommunications industry since 1984. Philips hoped its partnership with ATandamp;T would revive its struggling telephone-exchange business. ATandamp;T wanted Philips's international marketing experience to help launch the American company's first major overseas business since a U.S. court ordered its reorganization in 1984.    But the venture's growth has been slowed by political opposition in Europe's telecommunications markets -- where government phone companies generally are the biggest customers and politics decide contract awards. When the venture formed in 1984, French President Francois Mitterrand publicly scolded Philips for betraying European solidarity by forging a link with an American company.    Eugene Eckel, the venture's president, said sales last year totaled 900 million Dutch guilders and will rise about 30% in 1988. He said pretax losses in 1987 were less than 50 million guilders, and he predicted a small profit this year. </TEXT></DOC>
