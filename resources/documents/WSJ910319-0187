Referring to reports oflimited food shipments through Iran, he said, &quot;There are somesemitransparent windows,&quot; but not enough to meet the direneeds of hungry people inside Iraq.   What is under way there is essentially a referendum on therule of Saddam Hussein, he said. &quot;The answer has been a big`no.' The people have given their verdict -- they are writingit in their blood.&quot;   All of the participants in the news conference stressedthat they don't seek, or need, arms or military support.&quot;Iraq is one big armory from border to border,&quot; said Mr.Abdul Rahman, so opposition fighters have been able toacquire more than enough weapons and ammunition. Anddefections in huge numbers from the army and militias havebolstered the ranks of opposition fighters.   The Kurdish resistence, &quot;Pesh Merga&quot;, or &quot;we who facedeath,&quot; had been reduced to a few thousand guerrillas beforethe Gulf war through systematic repression and chemicalattacks in 1988. Now, Kurds say, the Pesh Merga ranks haveincreased 10-fold because armed Kurdish militiamen haveforsaken the government side.   The opposition spokesmen all stated that warnings of civilwar and Lebanization of Iraq are alarmist exaggerations whoseeffect may be to keep Saddam Hussein in power. Neither theShiites nor the Kurds say they are seeking a separate state.Kurds say they want only implementation of their 1970agreement with the Iraqi government, which promisedpower-sharing, autonomy and cultural rights.   The Shiites, estimated at 55% of Iraq's population, saythey want a more proportionate share of power through theestablishment of democracy in Iraq.   Also at the news conference, Jawad alMaliki of the radicalIslamic group, alDawa, made a &quot;brotherly appeal&quot; for therelease of &quot;innocent hostages&quot; still being held in Lebanon.Al-Dawa has close ties to Iran. The result of thehostage-taking, said Mr. al-Maliki, has only been to &quot;createinternational tension.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
