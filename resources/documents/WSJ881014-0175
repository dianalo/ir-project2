The company earlier offered the test on a limited basis as part of a research project that it conducted with the National Institutes of Health and Massachusetts General Hospital.    Huntington's disease is an incurable, inherited nervous system disorder that causes dementia and early death. Symptoms usually first appear between ages 30 and 50.    The test allows doctors to predict, before symptoms appear, whether people in families with Huntington's disease are at high risk for developing it. It also enables prenatal testing of offspring of parents who may carry the gene for the disease and are at risk for passing it to their children. Huntington's disease affects about 25,000 people; an additional 150,000 people are at risk of developing the disease, Integrated Genetics said.    The test -- performed at the company -- will be sold to genetic counseling centers, a spokeswoman said. It will be priced at $2,750, and people who request it must enter a program that includes psychological counseling concerning the possible outcomes of the test, she added.    Integrated Genetics, whose genetic tests are based on technology for detecting certain DNA &quot;markers&quot; of diseases, currently offers six other tests for inherited diseases, including cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia. </TEXT></DOC>
