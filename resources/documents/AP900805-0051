In the past week, Lithuania and Estonia have begun work on drafttrade treaties with the Soviet Union's largest republic, bypassingthe national government.   Estonia may recruit its own police force to replace the Sovietmilitia. Latvia plans to start privatizing its economy by Oct. 1,regardless of what the rest of the country does.   And all three republics have said they will not take part innegotiations to revise the treaty which binds the Soviet Union's 15diverse republics together.   Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, meanwhile, meetsregularly with Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov to work outdetails for negotiations on Lithuanian independence.   Steadily, the Baltic leaders have been taking matters into theirown hands. They have been aided by the president of the Russianrepublic, Boris Yeltsin, who seized the initiative on economicreform and pushed Gorbachev into accepting his ``500 Days'' programfor the entire country. The Russian Federation is by far thelargest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics and is home to more thanhalf of the nation's population.   While Gorbachev vacationed in the Crimea, Yeltsin took hisholiday on the Baltic Sea in Latvia. He did not spend much time onthe beach, news reports indicate.   Instead, he met with Baltic leaders and offered to negotiaterepublic-to-republic treaties on political, economic, cultural, andother issues, bypassing the national government.   Already, Russian Prime Minister Ivan Silayev and Mrs. Prunskienehave agreed on ``all the key issues that interest our republics''and have asked their officials to prepare a draft economic treatyfor as early as mid-August, the official Tass news agency reported.   Eduardas Vilkas, a member of the Lithuanian negotiatingcommission, says the economic treaties envisage ``a free commonmarket.''   Mrs. Prunskiene was quoted Saturday as telling the Interfax newsservice of Radio Moscow that some hitches remain, such as whetherthe Russian republic can guarantee to sell oil to Lithuania whenthe national government claims ownership of the energy industry.   On Sunday, representatives of Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia,Byelorussia, Moldavia, the Russian Federation, the cities of Moscowand Leningrad, and the district of Leningrad met in the Estoniancapital of Tallinn to begin ``economic cooperation based ontreaties as a first step toward the ideas of a common market,'' theEstonian News Agency reported.   The meeting was convened by the Estonian leadership to counterwhat the news agency called ``economic pressure from centralauthorities in Moscow.''   Estonia last week won an unpredecented concession from thenational government when Soviet Interior Minister Vadim Bakatinagreed to give up his control of the republic's Interior Ministryand let Estonia create its own police force.   Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told the Izvestianewspaper that ``the Estonian government is now fully responsiblebefore the population for ensuring public order, protection ofcitizens' rights and freedoms on the republic's territory.''   Latvian Prime Minister Ivar Godmanis, who recently returned fromthe United States, said economic experts from theIndianapolis-based Hudson Institute have agreed to come advise hisgovernment, and Latvian students will be sent to American businessschools.   ``Latvian private sector and not only farmers need theinvestments. If we are to overcome the present crisis, we shouldembark on privatization of the Latvian economy by Oct. 1 at thelatest,'' he told the Postfactum news agency.   Latvia plans to privatize 25-30 percent of the republic'seconomy, excluding land and natural resources, within four or fiveyears. Property will be sold to private individuals or collectives,including foreign ones, or handed over to public and religiousorganizations.   Lithuania declared independence on March 11, and Latvia andEstonia both have declared their intention to follow at the end ofunspecified transition periods.</TEXT></DOC>
