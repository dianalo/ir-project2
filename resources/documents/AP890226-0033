Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski's appearance at the theaterSaturday illustrates the different paths the East bloc countries aretaking in confronting their critics.   While Czechoslovakia's Communist Party leader, Milos Jakes, haschosen to crack down on dissent, Rakowski's government has startednegotiations on political and economic reforms with the oppositionit once tried to crush.   Many Western countries have criticized the Feb. 21 decision of aPrague court to sentence Havel to nine months in jail on charges ofinciting citizens to take part in a banned demonstration last monthand obstructing police officers.   But nowhere in the East bloc has Havel's jailing aroused suchinterest among officials and anger among independent intellectualsas in Poland.   Even the decision to allow the performance of the highlypolitical and critical works is a reversal of the authorities'attitude toward Havel, whose works have been published here only inthe underground press.   Havel's plays first were staged in Poland in late 1981, butproduction was suspended after only 12 performances when authoritiesimposed martial law that December to suppress the independentSolidarity trade union movement.   Filmmaker Feliks Falk, who directed the current production of twoone-act Havel plays, ``The Audience'' the ``The Protest,'' said hehas tried for a long time to get permission to stage the plays.   The cast began rehearsing in January and Havel originally wasinvited to the premiere, he said.   ``It's just a coincidence that Havel is in prison,'' Falk said inan interview. ``For us and for the actors, of course, theperformance is very important because of Havel, and because theplays are very good.''   Rakowski's appearance added a dramatic twist to the performanceof the two one-act plays.   Assistant theater director Krzysztof Rudzinski blanched and triedto stop a young activist from selling underground copies of``Thriller,'' a collection of Havel's political essays, in thetheater lobby.   Rakowski witnessed the scene as he arrived.   But the prime minister ignored the fuss and calmly took a regularseat in the theater, five rows away from Adam Michnik, a leadingPolish opposition theorist who like Havel has spent years in jailfor his writings and political activities.   For two hours the audience was spellbound, first by ``TheAudience,'' the tale of a simple brewery worker being pressured bypolice to inform on a writer whom authorities have forced to work inthe brewery as punishment for his political activities.   ``It shows the drama of the average man,'' historian BronislawGeremek said during intermission.   But it was ``The Protest'' that particularly touched the audienceof officials and intellectuals.   The story concerns the behavior of an official writer who appealsto an opposition writer to arrange a petition against the detentionof a musician involved with his daughter. But the writer balks whenasked to sign the protest the opposition already had formulated.   As the crowd applauded at the end of the play, Michnik jumped onstage to read a personal hand-written appeal to Czech authorities torelease Havel. But his protest was drowned by music blaring throughloudspeakers.   Michnik has met Havel several times at clandestine meetings ofPolish and Czechoslovak political activists in the mountains alongthe border that separates the two countries.   He called Havel a friend and symbol like Nobel Peace Prizewinners Andrei Sakharov from the Soviet Union and Poland'sSolidarity leader Lech Walesa.   He urged ``competent authorities to stop repression'' and urgedthe Czechoslovak leadership ``to take the same road as other EastEuropean countries are taking _ reconciliation with the nation.''   Havel was arrested Jan. 16 during an attempt with otheropposition activists to lay flowers in memory of Jan Palach, astudent who burned himself to death 20 years ago to protest the 1968Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.   Polish opposition groups quickly rose to his defense.   The national leadership of Solidarity; the independentPolish-Czech Solidarity Group; and the Polish chapter of theinternational writers' P.E.N. Club all have appealed to authoritiesto release Havel.   The Polish government declined to comment on his jailing, sayingit was an internal affair of Czechoslovakia.</TEXT></DOC>
