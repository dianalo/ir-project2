 Current generationCASE tools, however, handle only selected parts of the designprocess, such as code generation, and diagnostics.andP;  Much CASEdevelopment is done in the design and analysis stage at thebeginning of the programming process.andP;  It eliminates some of thetrial and error methods that lead to program faults.andP;  CASE toolsare being used mostly by MIS departments that write their ownsoftware.andP;  Few professional software developers employ the tool ona wide basis.andP;  However, the trend is towards further use as theindustry matures, and the software development process increasesin complexity.andP;  For small shops, CASE is still out of reach, butlow-cost alternatives are emerging.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Computer-aided software engineeringSoftware EngineeringProduct DevelopmentAutomationProgram Development Tools.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>In Their Own ImageandM;Software development has become an embarrassing topic for companies likeLotus and Microsoft.andP;  Delays in product releases are increasingly common, andsoftware bugs seem to be developing resistance to electronic insecticides.andM;By the end of last year, for example, the launch of Lotus's mammoth newspreadsheet package, 1-2-3 Release 3, had already been postponed three times.andO;Lotus said then that the upgraded version of the program would be out byMarch .andP;  .  .  for sure.andP;  No one was holding his breath.andM;The problem, according to Ed Your-don, a programmer turned consultant,lecturer, and general guru of logical programming techniques, is that the PCindustry hasn't yet learned disciplined programming methods.andP;  The solutionmay be something called computer-aided software engineering, or CASE.andP;  Thisemerging technology uses computers to help people program other computers,bringing a measure of engineering precision to what has traditionally been ablack-magic art.andM;The dream is cradle-to-grave automation that starts by designing a softwaredevelopment system and eventually spits out the lines of computer code thatconstitute a finished program.andP;  All major CASE software suppliers say that'stheir goal; some, especially KnowledgeWare, of Atlanta, and TexasInstruments, of Plano, Texas, say they're close to achieving it.andM;So far, however, individual CASE tools tackle only parts of the softwaredesign process.andP;  Some automatically write computer code.andP;  Others helpcorporate data processing departments maintain their software.andP;  Generally,CASE products implement computerized methods for the early planning, design,and analysis of programs--the stage that accounts for up to three-quarters ofthe bugs afflicting end users.andM;A Mainframe HeritageandM;Design-stage CASE helps developers map a program, define its parts, andstraighten out all the relationships between parts before programming begins.andO;Mainframe programmers say it yields faster results, with far fewer bugs, thanthe plan-as-you-write method.andM;They should know.andP;  Computer-aided software engineering began as a problemsolver for mainframe-oriented corporate programmers.andP;  As PC processing powerincreases and PC software becomes more sophisticated, PC programmers may haveto follow the mainframers' lead.andP;  Today's word processing applications oftencontain as many as a half million lines of code.andM;To write such large programs, the software houses need a better way tostructure their work.andP;  The current situation means &quot;big problems&quot; forcompanies like Lotus and Microsoft, says Ken Orr, president of theSchaumburg, Illinois-based CASE supplier Optima and a principal of theRosetta Institute, a technology management consulting firm in Topeka, Kansas.andO;People in the know whisper that PC programming, even at the industry'sleading companies, is still a helter-skelter, write-on-the-fly operation.andO;Their development departments are filled with &quot;exceedingly smart peopleworking very long hours without much methodology,&quot; Orr says.andM;CASE is pure methology.andP;  Just as computer-aided design (CAD) automatesmechanical drafting, CASE automates the structured programming methodsspearheaded in the 1970s by people like Yourdon.andP;  Without a good design,programmers and planners aren't always sure what the machine should do ateach turn, so they play it by ear, making it up as they go along.andP;  CASE givesthem a game plan.andM;New SolutionsandM;PC-based CASE software for planning, design, and analysis has been aroundsince Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Index Technology founded the field withExcelerator in 1984.andP;  It and many other CASE tools that run on personalcomputers automate planning by computerizing the diagrams that softwaredesigners make to represent data flow.andM;But CASE software adds a lot more to the development process than fancierflowcharts.andP;  It analyzes the diagrams, looking for problems like bottlenecksthat may slow down a program.andP;  It can paint prototypes of screen displays,helping to create more effective user interfaces.andP;  It can also break up thedesign into logical chunks, or modules, that can be assigned to differentprogramming teams.andP;  The programmers use these designs as a detailed roadmaptelling them exactly what their code should do and how it should do it.andM;&quot;It's probably going to take longer for the PC industry to move to CASEbecause it's younger industry.andP;  It's still making all its mistakes,&quot; evenmistakes that mainframers ironed out years ago, says Yourdon.andP;  The PCsoftware giants that creat landmarks like 1-2-3 and MS-DOS began as garageshops of just a few people.andP;  And they still tend to suffer from what Orrcalls the &quot;hacking syndrome.&quot;andP;  He explains, &quot;They still want to believe thatthey're that little bitty shop.&quot;andM;Of course, they're not.andP;  As their programs become coordinated efforts ofdozens of people, software developers have to tighten up their act.andP;  Sincethe major PC software firms are already in the business of writing software,they're likely to use in-house expertise to develop their own CASE tools,possibly with outside help.andP;  One big firm recently signed Orr as a CASEconsultant.andM;As software companies become more familiar with it, CASE should put an end tothe try-and-try-again approach to PC programming, shortening the developmentcycle, cutting costs, and killing bugs.andP;  &quot;I see it facilitating themanufacturing process,&quot; says Yourdon.andP;  &quot;The fundamental result is higherquality.&quot;andP;  What CASE won't do is lead to completely new applications.andP;  Thecreative stuff, Yourdon says, will probably always come from those thinkersin the back rooms.andM;Other ProgrammersandM;The big PC software houses, creating complicated applications involvinghundreds of thousands of lines of code, will lead the way to CASE on the PC.andM;But the CASE concept will also affect other types of programmers.andP;  Manycorporate programmers do their work on personal computers, creating softwareto run on mainframes and minicomputers.andP;  Studies indicate that less than 10percent of IBM mainframe and compatible corporate programming departments nowuse CASE tools.andP;  The huge backlog in corporate data processing departments isexpected to push that figure significantly higher.andM;So far, corporate DP departments have concentrated on programming for largesystems, leaving PC programming to individual workgroups.andP;  That's starting tochange, and CASE should be in the thick of things as DP departments step upPC application development.andM;&quot;A lot of PC applications planned for the future will extract and feed datafrom corporate-wide databases on the mainframe,&quot; says Dan Rice, seniorsystems manager for Merrill Lynch.andP;  &quot;You can't afford to put up somethingquick and dirty,&quot; Rice says.andP;  &quot;PC programs will be as complex as anything onthe mainframe.&quot;andP;  Merrill Lynch has been using CASE for almost four years.andM;One-Man bandsandM;There is also a community of one-man programming shops, says Yourdon, but&quot;those guys are still building relatively simple applications,&quot; with maybeonly 50,000 lines of code.andP;  &quot;A one-man genius can do it.andP;  CASE is not alife-or-death issue [for them],&quot; he says.andM;Yet many of these independent programmers have silicon in their blood.andP;  Givethem a better computer tool and they'll buy it no matter how little they needit.andM;To date, commercial CASE products for the PC have been few, far between, andfar too expensive.andP;  The pioneer Index Excelerator, for example, starts atabout $8,000.andM;All that may be about to change.andP;  Computer System Advisers, in WoodcliffLake, New Jersey, has introduced a Picture-Oriented Software Engineering(POSE) package, consisting of nine mix-and-match modules at an introductoryprice of $295 each.andP;  POSE marketing chief Art Latterman says POSE modulesallows programmers to bite off smaller pieces at first and then grow intofull-blown computer-aided software engineering at their own pace by addingmodules.andM;Designed in Singapore, the new system weds a Macintosh-like graphicalinterface to the power and function of more costly CASE design tools.andP;  &quot;IfCASE tools don't look like they're as friendly as paper and pencil, peopledon't want to use them,&quot; according to Latterman.andM;POSE's low price is pulling in all sorts of programmers who couldn't affordearlier CASE products.andP;  Hobbyists, small programming shops, and others arefollowing the lead of the big boys and converting to CASE.andM;&quot;POSE is the first CASE tool with meat in it in this price range,&quot; ways SueAnn Hawley, a software marketing consultant in West Bloomfield, Michigan, whohas seen a lot of CASE products come and go.andM;The rise of CASE can't help but spill over into the lives of PC users whodon't program.andP;  CASE should help lead to better programs that have fewerbugs, are created at lower cost, and are released on time.andP;  And who can arguewith that?andO;</TEXT></DOC>
