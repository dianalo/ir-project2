GCA, which declined to identify the prospective buyer other than as a publicly traded company, said there are &quot;no assurances&quot; that the negotiations will result in its acquisition.    Andover, Mass.-based GCA is a leading U.S. maker of wafer steppers -- machines used to etch electronic circuits on silicon chips. Its fortunes plummeted in recent years because it miscalculated the depths of the industry slump that began in 1985 and continued until the middle of last year.    Yesterday it reported a loss of $9.5 million on sales of $80.3 million for 1987. Its loss from operations was even worse, $56.4 million, but was offset in part by a $47 million extraordinary gain from a financial restructuring. GCA had a loss of $24.9 million on sales of $123.1 million in 1986. In contrast, the company had earnings of $28.6 million on sales of $240.1 million in 1984.    Despite its poor results of late, GCA appears to be rebounding, thus making it a potentially attractive acquisition. The company said, for example, that its order backlog at the end of 1987 was $57.6 million, compared with $18.2 million the year before.    &quot;They're on the road to recovery,&quot; said Stephen Balog, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. &quot;They've got the technology and a huge installed base of this equipment.&quot; Mr. Balog, noting that International Business Machines Corp. uses GCA equipment to make its most advanced memory chips, said that GCA's technology remains state of the art. Its main international rivals are Japanese companies.    Raj Rajaratnam, an analyst at Needham andamp; Co., said that GCA's sales probably would improve if it is acquired. &quot;Customers are worried about (GCA's) financial condition. If a strong company buys&quot; it, customers will be more willing to buy GCA products, he said.    GCA shares closed yesterday at $3.875, up 37.5 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    GCA could &quot;come close to breaking even&quot; in the first quarter, Mr. Balog said. He added, &quot;The timing is impeccable for whoever is buying.&quot; In the 1987 first quarter, GCA had a loss of $12.6 million on sales of $13.4 million. Its stock has climbed from $2.25 a share in mid-February.    Mr. Balog noted that a takeover would benefit GCA because it needs working capital to meet demand. Despite a restructuring that resulted in a cash infusion and cancellation of debt in April 1987, it was pinched for cash and issued $20 million of convertible notes in December; any buyer would have to buy back those notes or otherwise risk substantial dilution upon their conversion into common stock, analysts said.    Its major shareholders, which each own about 10% of GCA's stock, are Hallwood Group Inc., a Cleveland-based financial services concern, and Matra S.A., a French electronics and defense company. </TEXT></DOC>
