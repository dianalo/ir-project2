Manuel Antonio Noriegahas executed ``probably more than 100'' officers and troops since afailed Oct. 3 coup.   ``As a result, there cannot be a chivalrous coup d'etat in thefuture. The next batch of coup plotters won't be interested inhanding Noriega over to us or dispatching him into exile,'' saidRep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.   ``Noriega has changed the ground rules. So the next coup will bebloody.''   The purge, Skelton said, amounts to 3 percent of the men in thePanamanian Defense Force.   Skelton's comments came a day after his Defense Policy Panelreceived a closed-door, top-secret briefing from Gen. MaxwellThurman, chief of the U.S. Southern Command, based in Panama.   Skelton said Noriega had killed ``more than 70 and probably morethan 100 officers and men of the Panama Defense Force.''   ``Before October, coups in Panama were essentially bloodless. Ifyou lost a coup, you lost your job _ but not your life. Noriega haschanged all that,'' Skelton said in a statement.   The result is that any new coup attempt, ``if successful, willdo little that we want except eliminate Noriega, which willprobably happen in a manner we do not wish to be associated with,''Skelton said.   ``Whoever wins lives, and whoever loses will die. That's thegame we're in now,'' he said.   Intelligence sources have said that, in the wake of the failedcoup, the Central Intelligence Agency has received congressionalclearance for a new covert plan that would spend up to $3 millionto depose Noriega. The plan would permit aiding coup plotters, evenif violence were likely, as long as the plot did not include plansfor assassination.   A longstanding executive order bars U.S. operatives fromparticipating in any plot to assassinate a foreign leader.   Skelton said he was satisfied that the likelihood Noriega coulddie in a later coup does not necessarily represent an impediment toU.S. involvement.   ``A death involved in a coup is different from an out-and-outassassination attempt,'' he said.   Noriega's purge has left a ``concentration of thugs'' in thePDF, which lessens the chances that any new coup would lead to arestoration of democracy and elimination of drug trafficking andmoney laundering, Skelton said.   The coup attempt occurred during Thurman's first week as the newchief of Southcom, and Skelton was among the harshest congressionalcritics of U.S. failure to give full support to the rebels led byMaj. Moises Giroldi.   But after Thurman's briefing, Skelton said it was clear that thecoup attempt was flawed because it was based on the ``irrationalpremise'' that Noriega would agree to retire to his farm in Panama,and because the rebels wouldn't turn Noriega over to U.S.authorities, would not have restored democracy and probably wouldhave continued Noriega's drug operations.   At the Pentagon, a spokeswoman, Maj. Kathy Wood, said securityhas been tightened at U.S. defense sites in Panama because of bombthreats.   Wood said that the first such threat was made about a week agoand that the new security steps have been in effect for nearly aweek's time.   ``It means that they are inspecting cars more carefully, andthat some parking lots have been closed if they are within 75meters of buildings,'' Wood said.   U.S. personnel are acting under personnel movement limitationsthat require them to keep others advised of their movements, toexercise caution and to avoid any known trouble areas, Wood said.</TEXT></DOC>
