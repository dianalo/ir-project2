Col. William R. Higgins,warned on Sunday that the kidnappers will be held ``fullyresponsible'' for the safety of Higgins and other American hostages.   The White House released the terse statement after the captorsof Higgins threatened to hang him within 24 hours if Israel failsto free the pro-Iranian fundamentalist cleric who was abducted fromLebanon.   In a statement read by spokeswoman Alixe Glen, the White Housesaid:   ``We hold the kidnappers of American hostages fully responsiblefor their safety. We expect those who have influence with thehostage holders to do everything possible to ensure that no harmcomes to those hostages or other Americans.''   In Paris, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler saidSecretary of State James A. Baker III discussed Higgins' situationearlier Sunday at a meeting with U.N. Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar. Both men are in Paris attending a 19-nationconference on Cambodia.   ``It is outrageous and uncivilized that he should have beentaken hostage in the first place,'' Ms. Tutwiler said of Higgins.``It is equally outrageous to threaten to kill him.''   She called the threat ``an affront to the entire civilizedcommunity.''   The threat to hang Higgins came from the undergroundOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth, which delivered a messageto a Western news agency in Beirut on Sunday. The threat came twodays after helicopter-borne Israeli commandoes kidnapped SheikAbdul Karim Obeid, 33, and two colleagues from Obeid's home insouth Lebanese village and flew him to Israel.   The threat, typed in Arabic, said:   ``This will be our first response to the stupid Israeliaggression and the flagrant American support that proves U.S.complicity in the crime.''   ``We shall execute by hanging the death sentence handed downagainst proven spy Higgins at exactly 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT) Monday ifSheik Abdul-Karim Obeid and his two brethren have not been freed bythen.''</TEXT></DOC>
