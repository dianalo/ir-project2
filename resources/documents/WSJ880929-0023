Late in the New York business day, the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.8768 marks, down from 1.8783 marks Tuesday, and at 134.03 yen, down from 134.66 yen. Sterling gained to $1.6901 from $1.6784.    In Tokyo Thursday, the dollar opened at 133.98 yen, down from Wednesday's close of 134.20 yen.    The approaching end of the month, quarter and first half of Japan's fiscal year kept many market participants on the sidelines Wednesday, dealers said. They added that the market's underlying sentiment toward the dollar remains positive because of the shrinkage of the U.S. trade deficit in recent months, the buoyant growth of the U.S. economy, the high level of U.S. interest rates and the widespread belief that these rates will increase.    However, buying of dollars has been stalled by Monday's intervention against the currency by a number of central banks, including the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bundesbank, and numerous statements lauding currency stability by officials of Group of Seven nations -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- at the International Monetary Fund-World Bank meetings in Berlin.    Initially, the Group of Seven endorsement of exchange-rate stability met with skepticism. In a vaguely worded communique following their weekend meeting, group officials &quot;emphasized their continued interest in stable exchange rates among their currencies . . . .&quot; Traders at first viewed this statement as indicating only weak opposition to further gains by the dollar. However, subsequent comments by individual officials endorsing stability, together with Monday's broad, coordinated intervention, convinced market participants that they had misinterpreted the communique, traders said.    Group of Seven officials have made it clear that &quot;they don't want any further appreciation&quot; of the dollar, said James McGroarty, foreign-exchange manager for Discount Corp.    Reiterating the Group of Seven's desire for exchange-rate stability, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said the group has a &quot;vital interest in stable exchange rates&quot; in the foreseeable future. The group's actions have frightened the market away from acting out its desire to buy dollars, dealers said.    Given the Group of Seven's wishes, dealers foresee continued narrow-ranged movement by the dollar for the rest of the week. One trader predicted the dollar will stay in a range of 1.8725 to 1.8825 marks Thursday and 1.87 to 1.89 marks through Friday, assuming that U.S. leading indicators for August, due to be announced tomorrow, show strong growth.    Sterling continued to receive support Wednesday from the better-than-expected trade and current-account figures announced Monday, dealers said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $398.20 an ounce, up 90 cents. Estimated volume was a moderate 3.3 million ounces.    In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was quoted at $399.25 an ounce.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, Sept. 28, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
