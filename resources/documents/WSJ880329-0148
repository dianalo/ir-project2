But the phrase is so confusing that one foreign banker says a Chinese client grilled her on what constitutes &quot;international practice.&quot;    Chinese political leaders have always had a penchant for slogans that are creative, punchy -- and ambiguous. In a country where toeing the party line is the politically safe thing to do, slogans are seriously studied and indiscriminately applied.    But boiling down official policy into slogans, which reached a zenith during the chaotic Cultural Revolution, is less workable in today's pragmatic times as China seeks to modernize its political and economic structure and strengthen trade and other links with foreigners.    &quot;Monitoring Chinese politics has become a study of fads and trends,&quot; says a diplomat who has watched China's economy for years.    An economist at the Guangdong Academy of Social Sciences explains China's apparent lack of a comprehensive economic-development strategy: &quot;Last April we were still thick in the midst of an anti-bourgeois campaign; it wasn't realistic to talk about planning when no one could predict then that the 13th Communist Party Congress {in October} would close in favor of reformists.&quot;    The economist says his office at the academy, which studies Asian capitalist economies, had been quiet until a few months ago, when the provincial government and the party began buzzing him for information on Asia's prosperous trading territories: Taiwan, South Korea, Hong Kong and Singapore. This research fad was prompted by articles in the state-run newspapers stating that Guangdong province's economy is at the same stage as the so-called Four Little Dragons were in the 1960s, when they began export-processing on a large scale. &quot;Many officials were boning up on the Four Little Dragons, thinking that the theory is being pushed by Beijing,&quot; says the economist.    But when newspapers dropped the discussion, interest in the four economies fizzled. Instead, what is in vogue now is &quot;two heads on the outside,&quot; a slogan invented by Mr. Zhao that urges factory managers to stick two heads into world markets, one scouting for raw materials and the other for buyers.    In plain language, Mr. Zhao is promoting export processing-assembling components supplied by foreign companies that then export the finished goods. Such export processing has made Guangdong province China's leading exporter, and Mr. Zhao wants other coastal areas to follow suit.    But the recognition won by export processing is another flip-flop in the country's development strategy. Less than a year ago, the coastal cities were feverishly trying to attract foreign investments in capital-intensive, high-technology industries. A foreign banker recalls, &quot;Every county, including the remote and backward ones, had a plan for a power plant, a five-star hotel and some state-of-the-art technological projects.&quot;    Assembly work was dismissed then as exploitation of China's work force, businessmen say. The Zhuhai economic zone and the Shekou industrial district even banned processing agreements with foreign businesses.    The official line now has spun 180 degrees. &quot;If we spend all our energy building {high-technology factories}, our people will starve to death,&quot; says Li Yizhou, an official at the Guangdong Commission of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade.    As with the high-tech fad, foreign critics say the promotion of export processing is overdone. They say such business flourishes in Guangdong because it is near Hong Kong, and thus wouldn't work in faraway regions.    Yet when a fad emerges, few academics or newspapers will publicly criticize it, analysts say. An official who wrote an article on China's economic-development strategy says a local newspaper ran the piece last month in full, except for the part that criticized export processing.    &quot;In our country, every institution plays second fiddle to politics,&quot; he says.    Promoting economic role models isn't new. In 1964, Mao Tse-tung hailed the spirit of self-sacrifice in rural Da Zhai county, where peasants turned barren land into a supposedly prosperous commune. Mao also told workers to learn from the workers who persevered in drilling for oil in Manchuria's snow-covered Da Qing field. Some of the role models, especially Da Zhai, later were exposed as frauds.    Much economic sense has returned to China since Mao died in 1976. Still, policy guidelines issued by senior Chinese leaders are mostly bland spiritual directives devoid of concrete measures, analysts say. A middle-ranking official recalls attending a State Council meeting where a Politburo member rambled for an hour on the proper attitude toward economic reform.    After the meeting, the official was instructed to learn the speech by heart and practice its principles. The official confesses that he wasn't enlightened by the speech and doubts that many others at the meeting were. &quot;If we don't understand the central guidelines, what chances do provincial-level officials have?&quot; he asks. </TEXT></DOC>
