<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-28-0038 </DOCNO><TEXT>A simple microscopic approach to the calculation of the exchange partof the real nucleus-nucleus optical potential based on a generalizationof the double-folding model and the local density matrix formalism hasbeen proposed. The model successfully reproduces the nuclear rainbowscattering data for {alpha}-particles, /sup 6/Li and /sup 9/Be. The roleof knock-on exchange effects in these processes is considered in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
