The Arabic-language letter, signed by ``Friends of Britishbusinessman Robin Gregson,'' said his disappearance was reported tothe British Embassy three months ago but was ignored.   ``Our friend Robin Gregson went missing more than six months agobetween the town of Chekka and the port of Jounieh. He was headingfor Jounieh to leave via its port on April 21,'' the letter said.   Chekka is a coastal town in Syrian-policed north Lebanon andJounieh is the main port in the Christian enclave. A passenger boatline serves the Christian enclave with daily trips from Jounieh toLarnaca, Cyprus.   ``We have inquired about his whereabouts with the Lebanese andCypriot immigration authorities as well as with a number ofpolitical parties in north Lebanon, but to no avail,'' the lettersaid.   ``The British Embassy was informed of the matter three monthsago, but unfortunately it did not show any interest in thedisappearance of one of its citizens,'' the report added.   Police said they have no record on Gregson and telephone callsto the British Embassy in Beirut's northern suburb of Jal el-Deebwere not answered.   The letter suggested that Gregson was kidnapped.   ``To his kidnappers we say: Release Robin so he could return tohis family and friends. More than seven years ago he chose to livein Lebanon because he loved Lebanon despite all that hashappened,'' the letter concluded.   The letter did not indicate where the friends lived.   Because his disappearance remains unconfirmed, Gregson was notlisted among the 13 Westerners missing in Lebanon, most believedkidnapped by pro-Iranian underground factions. The hostages includesix Americans. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped onMarch 16, 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
