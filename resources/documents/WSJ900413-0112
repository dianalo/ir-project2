But collecting on those orders is another matter. When themoney is available, restitution is often spread out over theterm of a defendant's probation, slowing collections. Of the$2.2 million in restitution ordered in the Southern Districtof Texas in 1989, for example, only $29,000 has beencollected, according to U.S. Attorney Henry Oncken ofHouston.   Besides, the restitution ordered is minuscule whencompared with the total cost of the thrift bailout, which, itwas estimated last week, would cost a minimum of $325billion.   The committee members' questions about restitution werethe sharpest leveled during the two days of hearings on theprogress of prosecution in thrift-related fraud cases. &quot;Wehaven't had any Sandamp;L fraud in Delaware,&quot; said Rep. ThomasCarper (D., Del.). &quot;Yet we're having to help you pay for it.We don't like it.&quot;   But Mr. Collins and his fellow U.S. Attorneys from Texasoffered little hope to Rep. Carper and intimated that longprison terms were a higher priority for prosecutors. &quot;Peoplein jail don't pay a lot of restitution,&quot; Mr. Collins said.&quot;Another complication is the length of time it takes forthese cases to come to investigation.&quot;   In the case of the defunct Sunbelt Savings Association ofTexas, which was singled out by the Banking Committee,investigators have been worked for 2 1/2 years and won guiltypleas from five officers of Sunbelt or affiliated companies.   But the investigation has yet to produce an indictmentagainst Sunbelt's former owner, Edwin T. McBirney III, whowas paid an annual salary of $252,000 on top of wildlyexpensive perquisites, according to evidence given to theHouse Banking Committee. Thrift regulators attribute almost$20 million in Sunbelt losses to expenditures for airplanes,parties, gifts and overdrafts on insiders' accounts.   Mr. Collins, when asked by Committee Chairman Henry B.Gonzalez why Mr. McBirney hasn't been charged yet, said hecouldn't respond because of the secrecy of the grand juryprocess. Mr. McBirney declined an invitation to testifybefore the committee.   A civil suit to collect some of Sunbelt's losses iscurrently being pursued against Mr. McBirney and other formerSunbelt officers and directors by the Federal DepositInsurance Corp.   Such civil actions by the FDIC offer a better chance ofcollecting restitution than criminal cases, Mr. Collins said.He resisted Rep. Gonzalez's suggestion that U.S. Attorneystake on more restitution chores through their civil sections.   &quot;We cannot begin to match what the regulators spend&quot; onoutside lawyers to pursue restitution, Mr. Collins said.</TEXT></DOC>
