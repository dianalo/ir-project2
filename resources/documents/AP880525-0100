American intelligence had received word that Imad Mugniyeh, aLebanese Shiite linked to terrorist attacks, was visiting Franceand some members of the administration advocated seizing Mugniyehand bringing him to the United States for trial, said the official.   The State Department, fearing an abduction would cause a majorblowup in U.S.-French relations, shot down the proposal, said theofficial, speaking on condition of anonymity.   Instead, French officials were asked to arrest Mugniyeh, butthey did not act on the request, said the official.   National Public Radio, which first reported the proposal, saidin a report broadcast today that the plan was conceived by WilliamCasey, then director of Central Intelligence.   NPR reported that it was never completely proven that Mugniyehwas in France at the time his abduction was proposed. In early1986, following new reports of Mugniyeh's presence in France, localauthorities did act on the U.S. request and went to a hotel toarrest him.   Instead of finding a Lebanese terrorist, police found a familyof vacationers, NPR reported.   Mugniyeh has been identified by U.S. terrorism experts as theleader of Islamic Jihad, an Iranian-backed group held responsiblefor the kidnapping of nine Americans and other westerners inLebanon.   He is under indictment in the United States on charges ofparticipating in the June 1985 hijacking of a TWA jetliner and thekilling of Navy diver Robert Stethem, one of the passengers.   The U.S. official who spoke of the proposal to abduct Mugniyehsaid ``there's always a lot of brainstorming about this sort ofthing. It was an idea that was floated. People were saying `how canwe do this'?''   ``It didn't get to the top level,'' he said.   ``The State Department felt strongly that if something like thiswas to be done it could not be through secret connivance; there hadto be a decision by French political authorities to arrest him andturn him over to the United States,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
