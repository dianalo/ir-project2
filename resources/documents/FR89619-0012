On March 27, 1987, RSPA publisheda notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (52 FR 9996) inviting comments on several specificproposed changes to its system of collecting information on incidents involvingthe transportation of hazardous materials. These changes are intended toenhance the value of the incident report form (DOT F 5800.1) as a meansfor the DOT to evaluate the effectiveness of its regulatory program, andto determine the need for regulatory changes to address new or emerginghazardous materials transportation safety problems. It is also intendedto facilitate and enhance the ease of completing the hazardous materialsincident report form for those who are required to submit this form toDOT.In response to the NPRM, RSPA received written comments from two governmentagencies and 13 members of the public. All comments have been consideredin preparing this final rule. Significant changes in this final rule fromthe proposals published in the NPRM are discussed in detail below. Informationcontained in the Supplementary Information section of the ANPRM and NPRMis hereby incorporated in this final rule by reference, except as it maybe superseded herein. The public reporting burden for this collection ofinformation is estimated to average one hour per response, including thetime for reviewing instructions and existing data sources, gathering andmaintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collectionof information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any otheraspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducingthis burden, to: Information Systems Manager, Office of Hazardous MaterialsTransportation, DHM-63, Research and Special Programs Administration, U.S.Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC 20590;and to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Paperwork Reduction Project(2137-0039), Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Changes From NPRM</ITAG>In response to the comments received and reviewed by RSPA, the final rulereflects several changes to the proposals contained in the NPRM. Section 171.15 Immediate Notice of Certain Hazardous Materials IncidentsThe NPRM had proposed to amend andSection; 171.15 (and andSection; 175.45 concerningincidents involving aircraft) to include three additional criteria forthe immediate (i.e., telephonic) notification of the Department of certaintypes of hazardous materials incidents.The first of the criteria pertains to incidents involving the evacuationof one or more properties adjacent to the property on which the incidentoccurs. One commenter found the language of this proposed reporting requirementto be ambiguous. This commenter stated that an ``airport is usually a contiguousproperty of many square miles and would presumably, therefore, not requirethe notification if evacuated,'' i.e., if people in one area of an airportwere evacuated to another area of the airport, the notification presumablywould not be required. In response to this comment, paragraph (a)(6) ofandSection; 171.15 has been reworded to eliminate references to adjacentproperties. The language of the proposed rule implied incorrectly thatthe Department need not be immediately notified of incidents where, forexample, the general public in one area of an airport were evacuated toanother area of the airport, or even of instances in which people are evacuatedfrom an airport to property or properties adjacent to the airport that,in turn, are not evacuated. This final rule clarifies that paragraph (a)(6)applies only to incidents resulting in evacuations of the general publicthat are the direct result of hazardous materials. The purpose of limitingthe scope of this reporting requirement to evacuations of the general publicis to preclude the reporting of events wherein the initial response ofeither emergency response or supervisory personnel is to clear an areauntil the presence and the nature of a hazardous material is identifiedand the scope of the public risk is more adequately defined. Several commenterssuggested that this safety purpose could be more effectively accomplishedby limiting the reporting requirement to evacuations lasting a certainlength of time. RSPA agrees with these comments and has accordingly modifiedthe reporting requirement to accommodate them. Incidents involving evacuationsof the general public with a duration of less than one hour will not requirethe immediate notification of the Department. It should be noted that,as written, the final rule does not require the immediate notificationof the Department if members of the general public are evacuated from anarea on the erroneous assumption that a hazardous material is present orinvolved, even if the duration of the evacuation exceeds one hour.A number of commenters objected to the requirement that the Departmentbe given immediate notification of incidents involving evacuations wherethere is no release or spill of a hazardous material. The basis for thisobjection is summarized by one commenter who noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * local officials often order evacuations when no threat of physicalinjury or property damage exists. Evacuations are frequently ordered outof an abundance of caution. For example, an evacuation is usually orderedwhen a train derails containing hazardous materials, even if no hazardousmaterial is released as a result of the derailment. The decision to evacuate,while understandable from the perspective of local officials, is not sufficientlyrelated to safety issues to require carriers to satisfy the notificationrequirement contained in the proposed rule, andSection; 171.15(a)(6).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">RSPA does not agree with this line of reasoning. The Department'sneed to be immediately informed of certain types of evacuations does notdepend on whether, in hindsight, a particular decision to evacuate an areawas disproportionate to the actual risks involved in an incident. As pointedout in the Department's Emergency Response Guidebook (Guidebook for InitialResponse to Hazard Materials Incidents, DOT P 5800.4), an ``evacuationis, by itself, a process of significant risk for the persons being evacuated.''The risk associated with a hazardous materials incident is directly relatedto the probability of the release or spill of the material and the numberof people exposed to the release or spill. When a tank car or a cargo tanktruck overturns, the probability of a release of the hazardous materialis certainly greater than otherwise, and the risk associated with suchevents can be reduced if the number of people exposed to the potentialrelease of the material is also reduced (i.e., by means of an evacuation).Finally, RSPA finds no merit in the argument that evacuations are neverwarranted unless there has been an actual release of a hazardous material.A tank car carrying a flammable gas can for a time be engulfed by fireand still not leak; but certainly an evacuation would be appropriate insuch a situation. Therefore, RSPA cannot accept the suggestion that thereporting requirement for evacuations be limited only to instances in whichthere has been an actual release of the hazardous material.The NPRM proposed to amend andSection; 171.15 to require the immediate notificationof the Department for all incidents involving the closure or shutdown ofone or more major transportation arteries or facilities for one hour ormore. The phrase ``major transportation arteries or facilities'' includes,at the minimum, segments of interstate highways; bridges or tunnels providingaccess to interstate highways; airports where scheduled passenger operationsare conducted; commercially navigable waterways; and railroad mainlinetrack. Several commenters opposed this reporting criterion on the groundsthat it is unduly broad and unnecessary from a safety standpoint, especiallyif no release or spill of a hazardous materials occurs. RSPA believes thatthere are significant safety concerns involved in decisions to shut downor close major transportation arteries and facilities that are the directresult of hazardous materials. Some of the more obvious safety concernsinvolved with the shut down or closure of major transportation arteriesand facilities are: The prevention of the general public from enteringthe area affected by the incident; diversions and delays in the routingof other hazardous materials; and the fact that incidents that result inthe shut down of major transportation arteries or facilities are, by theirvery nature, more severe and entail greater public safety concerns thanincidents that do not result in such disruptions. These safety concernsare not definable solely in terms of whether or not there has been a releaseof hazardous materials. Even for incidents involving fatalities or injuriesit is not necessarily the case that such incidents entail the involuntaryrelease of the hazardous material from its container. People have beenkilled or injured while cleaning tanks that contained hazardous materialsor by opening domes or manholes of cargo tanks and tank cars containinghazardous materials. These are incidents that may not entail the unintentionalrelease of the hazardous material.One commenter objected to the reporting criterion on the grounds that itwould require ``a rail carrier to immediately report practically everyderailment because a rail line is often closed for more than an hour whena train derails.'' This objection is apparently based on a misreading ofandSection; 171.15(a). While it is true that derailments almost always resultin rail lines being closed for more than an hour solely because of thesafety concerns and mechanical problems involved with clearing the track,it is not always the case that rail lines are closed ``as the direct resultof hazardous materials''. If a rail line is closed as the direct resultof hazardous materials for less than an hour, then carriers are not requiredto immediately notify the Department even if hazardous materials are present,unless other reporting criteria require such notification.The NPRM had proposed to amend andSection; 171.15 to require the immediatenotification of the Department for all incidents involving deviation ofan aircraft from its planned course or its scheduled landing. The onlycomment received on this reporting criterion pointed out that the criterionshould also pertain to flights that are terminated before take-off (i.e.,a turnaround) due to hazardous materials, and to certain other events,such as flights declaring an emergency due to hazardous materials, eventhough a flight did not deviate from its planned route, or entail an unscheduledlanding. RSPA agrees, and has changed this reporting requirement to pertainto all incidents in which as a direct result of hazardous materials, theoperational flight pattern or routine of an aircraft is altered.In reviewing the comments received in response to the proposed changesto andSection; 171.15 (and andSection; 175.45), RSPA believes the distinctionshould be clarified between incidents in which something happens as a directresult of hazardous materials (e.g., a death caused by exposure to a hazardousmaterials) and two other types of incidents. These are incidents in whicheither something happens to the hazardous material itself such as its beingspilled or something occurs in the presence of the hazardous material suchas the occurrence of a fire.Concerning the occurrence of fires and the presence of radioactive materials,andSection; 171.15(a)(4) as presently worded requires the immediate notificationof the Department for ``each incident * * * in which as a direct resultof hazardous materials: * * * fire, breakage, spillage, or suspected radioactivecontamination occurs involving shipment of radioactive material.'' In thecase of fires this reporting requirement can be incorrectly interpretedas applying only to instances in which a hazardous material (which maynot be a radioactive material) has caused a fire, i.e., the fire is a directresult of a hazardous material. The Department must be immediately notifiedregardless of whether or not the fire, or breakage, or spillage, or suspectedradioactive contamination is the direct result of a hazardous material.In light of these considerations, which also apply to incidents involvingetiologic agents, andSection; 171.15 has been reworded to clarify its intendedscope and coverage.Section 171.16 Detailed Hazardous Materials Incident ReportsThe NPRM proposed to revise the hazardous materials incident report form_DOTF 5800.1_to provide more meaningful and comprehensive data on incidents,especially in terms of causation and consequence factors. In general, theproposed revision of the report form was designed to retain as many featuresas possible of the current report form, not only because many of the datafields on the current report form are essential, but also because of thewide experience and familiarity the industry has with this form. The improvementin the analytic usefulness of the form was accomplished by carefully andmore logically reorganiziang data fields and by providing a much broaderarray of choices to be marked as factors that best describe the natureof the incident. In the past, this type of information was largely providedby carriers who submitted lengthy narrative descriptions of the incident.RSPA believes that this change to the report form will significantly facilitatethe completion of the form, provide a more systematic description of theincident, and decrease the time and effort involved in entering the informationinto RSPA's computerized incident data base. With one exception, all commentersfavored a revision of the current incident report form.A number of commenters suggested that several new data fields be addedto the report form and that other proposed and existing data fields beclarified. These suggestions have been carefully evaluated and, where appropriate,have been incorporated into the report form (exhibit andplusmin;1) and discussedin the guidance document for preparing the form (exhibit andplusmin;2). Forexample, the new report form now requires those submitting the form tocheck the appropriate block that best describes the land use and the typeof community at the site of the incident. On the other hand, the proposeddata field pertaining to the estimated ambient temperature at the timeof the incident has been deleted from the report form. RSPA believes thatsuch estimates are not likely to be very accurate and will be duplicatedby information requested elsewhere on the report form (e.g., instancesof package failures due to heat or freezing).Many commenters took exception to the proposed requirement that copiesof other required reports be submitted to RSPA along with the incidentreport form. RSPA agrees and has deleted the requirement accordingly. Thisaction, however, does not affect the current requirement in andSection; 171.16(a)(1)that a copy of the hazardous waste manifest be attached to the incidentreport form when the incident involves a hazardous waste; nor does it affectthe current requirement in andSection; 175.45(c) that, for incidents involvingaircraft, a separate copy of the incident report form be sent to the FAACivil Aviation Security Office nearest the incident.The NPRM proposed to require that photographs be taken of the damage topackaging and accompany all report forms for all incidents resulting ina fatality or an injury requiring hospitalization caused by the releaseof a hazardous material from bulk packaging such as portable tanks, cargotanks, rail tank cars (see andSection;171.8 for a precise definition of ``bulkpackaging''). Two commenters opposed this requirement. The American TruckingAssociation, Inc. (ATA) urged that photographs of incidents be furnishedat the option of the carrier; the National Tank Truck Carriers Inc., (NTTC)believed that the proposed requirement that carriers assist the Departmentin any investigation or special studies relating to an incident (see discussionon andSection; 171.21, <T3>infra.</T3>) would provide a better means for obtaining informationon how a package failed than that provided by a photograph. In light of these comments, RSPA has decided to retain the present languageon the current incident report form that photographs and diagrams of theparticulars of an incident should be, but are not required to be, submittedfor clarification along with the report form itself. Several commenters urged that RSPA give consideration to incorporatinginto Part 171 of 49 CFR, a specific set of instructions for completingForm 5800.1, in a manner similar to 49 CFR 394.20, which provides instructionsfor the preparation of the Motor Carrier Accident Report form MCS-50T.This suggestion has not been accepted. Currently, RSPA publishes a detailed,seven-page document entitled ``Guidelines for Preparing Hazardous MaterialsIncident Reports.'' This guide is intended to assist carriers in accuratelycompleting the hazardous materials incident report, Form 5800.1, and isavailable to the public upon request to the RSPA. In conjunction with thisrulemaking, the guide has been extensively revised and expanded (see exhibitandplusmin;2). RSPA's experience has shown that possible future revisions,clarifications and additional instructional assistance in completing theincident report form are more easily accommodated and accomplished througha guidelines document than by incorporating such material into the bodyof the regulations. However, an informational note has been added at theend of andSection;171.16 to advise interested persons as to the availabilityof the guidelines free of charge upon request to RSPA. The NPRM proposed that the current 15-day period for submitting incidentreport forms be increased to 30 days in order to provide more time to gatherdata and complete the report form as accurately as possible. Generally,commenters were either silent about this proposal or were in support ofit. One commenter, however, urged RSPA to clarify the requirement thatthe information to be submitted within 30 days of the date of the incidentbe the best information available within 30 days. RSPA has not acceptedthis comment. Information that can reasonably be expected to be availablewithin 30 days is, by definition, the best information available. No usefulpurpose is served by creating an implied distinction between the best informationavailable and information that is less than the best. It is true that betterinformation on the consequences of an incident, especially in terms ofhealth effects or the estimated dollar amount of damage, may become availableafter 30 days. But RSPA has not proposed a requirement that carriers monitorthe consequences of an incident beyond 30 days and subsequently submitthis information to RSPA even though carriers on their own initiative maywish, and are encouraged, to do so. This final rule also reflects two further revisions to andSection;171.16.The phrase ``as a direct result of hazardous materials'' has been deletedfrom andSection;171.16(a) as no longer applicable in view of the need todistinguish between incidents and consequences which are the ``direct resultof hazardous materials'' and incidents involving the mere presence of hazardousmaterials. Section 171.16(a)(2) has been changed to reflect the fact thatPart H of the current report (Form F 5800.1) has become section VIII inthe revised report form. The comments relating to the proposed change to andSection;171.16 concerningthe requirement that carriers maintain a copy of each incident report fora period of two years are reviewed in the discussion under andSection;171.21below, because this record retention requirement is related to the requirementsof that section. Section 171.21 Assistance in Investigations and Special Studies As proposed in the NPRM, paragraph (a) of andSection; 171.21 would requirethat hazardous materials carriers make all records and information pertainingto any incident available, upon request, to an authorized representativeof the Department of Transportation. Further, under this paragraph, a carrierof hazardous materials is required to give an authorized representativeor special agent of the Department all reasonable assistance in the investigationof any incident. One commenter expressed concern about the interpretationof the phrase ``reasonable assistance,'' pointing out that it is possiblethat a carrier's understanding of this phrase could differ from that ofthe representative or agent of the Department. In order to avoid such differencesof opinion, the commenter suggested that paragraph (a) of andSection;171.21be limited to the requirement that carriers make any existing records availableto authorized representatives of the Department. RSPA has not acceptedthis comment. The language of andSection; 171.21 is virtually identical tothe language of andSection;394.15 of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations(49 CFR Parts 390-397). Section 394.15 has been in force for a number ofyears, and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) reports that the interpretationof the term ``reasonable assistance'' has not been a source of contentionbetween the FHWA and motor carriers subject to its jurisdiction. Moreover,the requirement establishes a ``reasonableness'' test which has wide currencyand broad judicial acceptance concerning matters that cannot be specifiedin advance. As proposed in the NPRM, under paragraph (b)(1) of andSection;171.21, carrierswould be required to respond with 15 days, or within such other time asspecified by the Department, to inquiries by the Department in connectionwith any Department studies of hazardous material incidents. A number ofcommenters urged that this paragraph be changed to permit a 30-day or longerresponse period. These commenters point to the possibility that a carriermight be unable to respond to such an inquiry within 15 days, especiallyif the inquiry involved a large number of documents. RSPA believes thatthe proposed 15 day limitation could be too restrictive, and a 30 day periodhas been adopted in the final rule. Since the incident report forms will be of significant importance in anyinvestigations or special studies conducted by the Department under andSection;171.21,the NPRM had proposed to revise andSection;171.16 to require all carriersto maintain a copy at their principal places of business of each incidentreport form submitted to the Department for a period of two years. TheAmerican Trucking Association (ATA) was joined by another commenter intaking strong exception to this proposed requirement on the grounds thatthis imposes an unreasonable paperwork burden on carriers, that the absenceof such a requirement in the current regulations has created no apparentproblem, that the retention of the incident report form by the carrierserves no useful purpose to the carrier or to the Department, and thatthe requirement results in the duplication of information. RSPA disagreeswith these comments for several reasons. First, regarding the paperwork burden on carriers, in general, given thatfailure to comply with the hazardous materials incident reporting requirementscan result in a civil penalty, it is doubtful that prudent carriers wouldnot keep copies of the reports they submit to the Department in their ownfiles. Moreover, 49 CFR 394.13 requires motor carriers to maintain ``** * a copy of each report that the carrier has filed pursuant to andSection;394.9,with a state agency, or with an insurer, with respect to any reportableaccident entered in the accident register.'' Some of these accident reportswill also entail hazardous materials incidents that are required to bekept by motor carriers under andSection;394.13(c) for a period of three years.It should also be noted that the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA)requires each railroad to maintain a duplicate of each form it submitsto the FRA under 49 CFR 225.21 for at least two years. Second, andSection;171.16 requires that the hazardous materials incidentreport form be provided to the Department in duplicate. The incrementalpaperwork burden of a carrier's preparing the incident report form in triplicate,with one copy for the carrier's own records, is minimal. Third, hazardous materials incident report forms can be and have been usedas evidence in court. RSPA does not believe that carriers can or wouldbe content with the idea that RSPA be the sole possessor of such records.This disposes of the claim that the retention of the incident report formby the carrier is of no use to the carrier, even apart from the insightand benefit a carrier can derive from studying its own record of hazardousmaterials incidents. Fourth, the contention that the absence of a record retention requirementin the current regulations has created no apparent problems is beside thepoint; it is precisely to prevent future problems, especially in termsof the enforceability of andSection;171.21, that is the principal reasonfor the record retention requirement. Without such a requirement, the investigationsand special studies envisioned in andSection;171.21 would be very difficult,if not impossible, to implement. This requirement will also aid in theverification of the accuracy of the reports submitted to RSPA, thus demonstratingthat the requirement is not only useful, but necessary. Finally, while the requirement does result in a duplication of information,this duplication has the result of increasing the availability and accessibilityof information. It does not duplicate efforts to obtain information. As proposed in the NPRM, a copy of each incident report was to be retainedat the carrier's principal place of business. However, as pointed out bythe ATA, under 49 CFR 394.13, motor carriers may maintain their accidentregisters at regional or terminal offices, upon written request to, andwith the approval of, Director, Regional Motor Carrier Safety, FHWA. Atthe urging of the ATA, RSPA has modified the requirement that a copy ofthe incident report form be retained at the carrier's principal place ofbusiness to include ``other places as authorized and approved in writingby an agency of the Department of Transportation.'' Additional Public Comments    In response to the NPRM, RSPA also received a number of comments on issueswhich, although they concern RSPA's Hazardous Materials Information System(HMIS), were either fully discussed and resolved in the preamble to theNPRM or were not the subject of any particular proposed amendments in theNPRM. Although it is not obligated to respond to such comments, RSPA believesthat the acknowledgment and a short discussion of these comments are worthwhile.   The Air Transport Association of America commented that the NPRM includedno proposal to exempt air carriers from the current requirement under paragraphs(c) and (d) of andSection;171.16 to report a hazardous material incidentinvolving a consumer commodity; a battery, electric storage, wet, filledwith acid or alkali; or paint and paint-related material when shipped inpackagings of five gallons or less. This commenter could find no justificationthat supports the ``continued requirements to report incidents that occuraboard aircraft which under all other circumstances DOT clearly believesto be trivial.'' In response to these comments, RSPA notes that the exceptionprovided by paragraphs (c) and (d) of andSection;171.16 does not apply toincidents involving the transportation of hazardous waste. Also, RSPA believesthat there is a fundamental difference in the risk of transporting hazardousmaterials aboard aircraft versus other modes of transportation. A simple,but non-trivial, instance of this difference is illustrated by the factthat, generally, unlike a truck driver, a pilot cannot simply stop hisvehicle to determine what is causing the smoke or fumes emitting from thecargo hold. Moreover, the rapidity with which pressure and temperaturechanges can occur aboard aircraft is vastly different from what can occuraboard vehicles and vessels in surface transportation.The Association of American Railroads (AAR), in connection with the requirementin andSection;171.15 that carriers report certain hazardous materials incidentsby telephone at the earliest possible moment, noted that:<ITAG tagnum="20">* * * for certain incidents two phone calls have to be made, to RSPA(49 CFR 171.15) and the National Response Center (40 CFR 300.37), and theFederal Railroad Administration and the National Transportation SafetyBoard (49 CFR 225.9 and 840.3). FRA and NTSB have coordinated their requirementsso that only one phone call has to be made to satisfy their requirements,although their actual notification requirements are independent of eachother. Similarly, RSPA and EPA have coordinated their requirements so thatonly one phone call has to be made to satisfy their requirements, althoughtheir requirements are also independent of each other. We see no reasonwhy RSPA, NTSB, FRA, and NRC cannot develop one set of notification requirementsfor transportation incidents.</ITAG>These comments are well taken, and RSPA, as time and response permit, willexplore the feasibility of a ``one call'' notification system under andSection;171.15which would simplify the carrier notification requirements.   The National Tank Truck Carriers, Inc. (NTTC) has commented on two issuesthat were discussed in the preamble of the NPRM. The first issue pertainsto the requirement in andSection;171.15(a) to report all unintentional releasesof hazardous materials, regardless of the amount of the material released.The NTTC believes the RSPA should establish ``a minimum product loss amountthreshold to trigger'' this reporting requirement. RSPA does not agree.Essentially, as explained in the preamble to the NPRM, such a reportingrequirement would severely diminish the usefulness of the hazardous materialsincident reporting system. The second issue raised by the NTTC pertainsto the question of who is responsible for reporting incidents occurringduring loading/unloading operations that are directed by or under the controlof shippers or consignees. It is the carrier who is required to reporteach incident that occurs during the course of transportation (includingloading, unloading, and storage incidental thereto), regardless of whois in control of the loading/unloading operations. However, the reportingrequirement does not apply if the carrier is not physically present atthe site of the incident (and not required to be) and has no knowledgeof the incident (``knowledge'' is defined in 49 CFR 107.299).   The ATA commented that the incident report form_DOT F 5800.1_provides informationthat is of value to DOT as well as to carriers, shippers, and containermanufacturers, and urged RSPA to make this information more available tothe public in terms of increased published reports and analyses based onthe incident reports it receives. Currently, RSPA publishes an annual reporton hazardous materials transportation which, among other things, providessummary statistics on hazardous materials transportation incidents. RSPAwill also soon be publishing a separate document devoted entirely to thepresentation of statistics on hazardous materials transportation incidents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Administrative Notices   </ITAG>a. <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act. </T3>The information collection requirementscontained in this rule were submitted for approval to OMB under provisionof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C.
