The president also seemed close to announcing other economic measures that, unlike the wage increases, are likely to please the country's creditors, including a devaluation of the local currency, the inti.    Peru's unconventional economic program always has called for keeping wages slightly ahead of inflation, and the government had budgeted a wage increase for about a month ago. But as the date approached, officials delayed the increase, apparently because of concern about the inflationary impact.    By last week, scores of teachers were staging hunger strikes and striking workers in the ministries of agriculture, transport and finance were demonstrating in the streets. On Friday, strikers burned tires and exploded dynamite near the Finance Ministry in central Lima. Meanwhile, the Apoyo SA polling service reported that only 36% of Lima's citizens thought Mr. Garcia was doing well or very well, about half the president's approval rating two years ago. The government decided it couldn't hold real wages down any longer.    Word of the increase brought concern, but not surprise, from independent economists. &quot;Inflation is running at a very high level, so the government had to do this (increase wages),&quot; said Richard Webb, a former president of Peru's central bank. &quot;The big question is whether inflation is going to explode or not. A lot of people are expecting that.&quot; On Saturday, the day after the wage increases were announced, the government raised the price of sugar and authorized higher prices for beer.    Labor leaders, meanwhile, complained that the wage increases weren't big enough. Leaders of the Confederation of Government Employees calculate that it costs 13,000 intis, or about $228, a month to feed the average working-class Peruvian family. But the minimum wage was only increased to 2,200 intis a month, from 1,700 intis.    The turbulence over wages has added to the anxiety and confusion that has characterized Peru since Mr. Garcia announced last July that the government would take over the nation's private-sector banks.    Meanwhile, the government's latest hints that it will soon devalue the inti seem a tacit admission that it will have to alter its economic program somewhat to encourage productive investment again. The country's economy has been deteriorating, with inflation rising and exports and hard-currency reserves declining. Peru has angered its creditors by unilaterally limiting interest payments on its $14.5 billion foreign debt.    But government officials aren't ready to part with their underlying economic principles, however controversial. &quot;One thing is clear, we won't be applying recessive adjustment measures,&quot; Daniel Carbonetto, Mr. Garcia's top economic adviser, said in a recent interview.    The forthcoming measures appear to involve a 25% devaluation of the inti against the dollar, a simplification of Peru's multitiered exchange rates and a warming of relations with the World Bank. In the past, the Garcia administration had argued that devaluations helped cause inflation. It tried to avoid devaluations as much as possible, a policy that many economists believe has hampered the country's exports.    But members of the government economic team &quot;now agree that there shouldn't be an . . . anti-export bias,&quot; said Mr. Carbonetto.    In September, Peruvian Finance Minister Gustavo Saberbein traveled to Washington to talk to the World Bank about the possibility of obtaining &quot;at least $2.5 billion&quot; over the next three years in loans for Peru, Mr. Carbonetto said. Mr. Saberbein will be returning to Washington for more talks with the World Bank next week. Peru is $90 million in arrears on its obligations to the World Bank.    Mr. Carbonetto said he is confident that &quot;there will be no major clash with the World Bank's technical staff.&quot; He said the Peruvian government now agrees that it must raise taxes and promote exports. </TEXT></DOC>
