A portable thermalconductivity probe is inserted temporarily in a 1-1/2 inch diameter boreholeand the rock is heated for a few hours, while the temperature rise atthe borehole wall is monitored. Testing of backfill/seal materials willbe carried out with the probe surrounded by these materials which willhave been placed, compacted and generally treated in a way which simulatesthe processes which will be used in a operational repository. 14 refs.,4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
