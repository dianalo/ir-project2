He did not have immediatedetails on why the sea lion died.   Wildlife agents agents trapped the sea lions in a floating cageWednesday and had planned to release the mammals today on thesouthewest Washington coast. They were to have been transported bytruck.   For five years, sea lions have been hanging out at the BallardLocks a few miles north of downtown Seattle, wolfing down thesteelhead and salmon that use a fish ladder to get from Puget Soundto Lake Washington and the spawning streams beyond.   The sea lion's death will not halt the effort to remove themarine mammals, Alabaster said, adding that trapping would continuetoday.   So far, protective nets, tape recordings of killer whales,firecrackers and foul-tasting chemicals have failed to stop thesteelhead and salmon suppers enjoyed by the voracious California sealions.   Some local fishing advocates have suggested the 20 or so beastsbe shot, but they are protected by federal law.   According to federal agents, one of the two sea lions capturedWednesday, known as Blue Eye because of a cataract, has been aproblem at the locks for three years. It was not immediately clearwhich sea lion had died.   The plan was to tranquilize the sea lions, attach radiotransmitters to them and transport them by truck on a trip of fivehours or more to the coast for release today off the Long BeachPeninsula, 250 miles southwest of Seattle.   Bob DeLong, a marine mammal biologist with the National MarineFisheries Service, admitted that scientists have no idea whether``Operation Goodbye'' will work. He conceded that Blue Eye certainlyknows the way back.   ``He's come back at least three years in a row from Californiaand Mexico and if he wants to come back, he'll return,'' DeLongsaid, adding that he could probably make the trip in two days if hehurried.   Wildlife officials said they eventually hope to capture at leasta half dozen animals and haul them to the peninsula, then see ifthey return.   If they don't, the rest of the problem animals that can be caughtwill be moved, DeLong said.   Wednesday's operation was observed by Ben Deeble of Greenpeace,which has protested some of the anti-sea lion actions in the pastbut gave qualified support to the removal effort.   Deeble said a primary concern was the drugging of the sea lions,which he said could kill the animals.   Deeble said long-term solutions to the problem of the hungry sealions would include modifying the approach the fish have to make tothe fish ladder, and increasing the number of fish in the watershed.However, that could be difficult at the rate the steelhead are beingkilled by the sea lions.   Steelhead are rainbow trout which return to their native riversand streams in western Washington after a few years in the PacificOcean.   The male sea lions, which summer in California and Mexico watersand winter off the coasts of Oregon, Washington and BritishColumbia, have increased dramatically in numbers since the passageof the Marine Mammal Protection Act in the mid-1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
