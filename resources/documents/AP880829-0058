Officials said flood waters also washed away amajor ferry terminal.   News reports today said 35 people died in the flooding Sunday,raising the death toll to 406 since it began in late June.   The destruction of the ferry terminal at Aricha, near Dhaka,snapped the capital's main waterway link to 19 flood-ravageddistricts, officials at the Communication Ministry said.   ``Even if we have ferry boats, where do we take millions ofmarooned people?'' an official in the Rajbari district said bytelephone, speaking on condition of anonymity.   There was no official report on Sunday's casulties. Thegovernment has said only 128 people have died in the floods.   But officials in Dhaka said today that four of the 19 affecteddistricts _ Sirajgang, Rajbari, Tangail and Faridpur _ werevirtually under water. Thousands of residents were fleeing forsafer shelter, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.   ``The situation is going to be worse than in 1987,'' said oneofficial. Last year's floods claimed at least 1,500 lives anddestroyed 2 million tons of grains, forcing Bangladesh, one of theworld's poorest nations, to import 3 million tons of rice.   President Hussain Mohammad Ershad held a special Cabinet meetingSunday to review the situation in this country of 105 millionpeople.   The Flood Forecasting and Warning Center predicted today thatrivers would continue to rise and reach a ``critical situation'' bymid-week.   Heavy rains and flooding are routine during summer monsoon inBangladesh, where rivers shred the country into ribbons of fieldsbetween mighty streams.   Independent newspaper, The New Nation, on Monday reported 35deaths from the 19 affected districts. The newspaper said most ofthe deaths occurred when houses made of mud and straw collapsed orwere washed away by surging water.   The newspaper said thousands of houses have been washed awayduring the past two weeks.   Government-owned daily, Dainik Bangla, said more than fourmillion people were stranded in the area and unable to get out. Thepaper said some residents have taken shelter in trees or on theroofs of government buildings.   Food was scarce and there were fears of an epidemic becauseclean drinking water is not available, the paper said.   There are not enough ferries to rescue the people.   In Dhaka, some streets in the old district where drainage ispoor, were under water today. In some places, residents used boatsto make their way through winding lanes.   Bangladesh has 64 districts.</TEXT></DOC>
