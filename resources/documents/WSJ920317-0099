Sales for 1991 were$19.4 billion.   The forecast surprised analysts, who had expected thatbenefits from last year's $1.6 billion restructuring wouldhelp catapult 1992 earnings to at least $4 a share. &quot;Ithought they'd show some uptick. Instead we had another clunkdown,&quot; said PaineWebber analyst Kimberly Retrievi.   &quot;That's a pretty horrendous performance,&quot; said PrudentialSecurities analyst B. Alex Henderson, who dropped his buyrecommendation following yesterday's news. He had estimated1992 earnings would be $4.65 a share. &quot;Where's the beef?&quot;quipped Wertheim Schroeder analyst Michael Ellmann.   Kodak stock was quoted at $40.75, down $1.875, in late NewYork Stock Exchange trading.   Kodak, based in Rochester, N.Y., has told analysts toexpect restructuring benefits of about $200 million, or 60cents a share in 1992. But with the release of yesterday'snumbers, analysts say, it's apparent that those benefits arebeing eaten up by increased spending on research anddevelopment, sales and advertising.   In addition, the company is suffering from weak sales. ForJanuary and February, imaging sales slipped 2% to 4%, whilefilm volume dropped 10%, Kodak told analysts. Dean Witteranalyst Eugene Glazer suggested the drop was due to inroadsbeing made by lower-priced private label films sold by massmerchandisers.   Information systems sales fell 5% to 10% for the first twomonths, as many analysts expected. The unit makes copiers,microfilm and graphic arts supplies.   Meanwhile, the health sector showed gains of 8% to 10%.And chemical sales decreased slightly, mostly because of anaccounting change, Mr. Henderson said.</TEXT></DOC>
