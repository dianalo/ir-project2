Inflation was running at an annual rate of 5.9% in September, almost double the rate at the start of the year, and many economists believe it will hit 7% in early 1989.    Meanwhile, company profits are growing at a healthy annual rate of about 15%, providing an incentive for workers to ask for large pay boosts. And companies have found that because of rising productivity, their real unit wage costs have barely risen.    &quot;The scene is set for an unpleasant twist in the wage-price spiral,&quot; said Bill Martin, chief U.K. economist at the London brokerage firm of Phillips andamp; Drew Ltd.    The 1988-89 round of pay negotiations gets under way next month, with most of the talks in March and April. The average increase in wages -- excluding overtime and bonuses -- was about 6.5% in the 1987-88 round, according to Mr. Martin. But inflation was only at 3.5% last March and unemployment was at 8.9%, compared with 8% in September. Mr. Martin said he expects an average pay increase of at least 8% this year.    The authorities are clearly worried that higher pay settlements will dilute the anti-inflationary effect of recent rises in British interest rates. Bank of England Governor Robin Leigh-Pemberton, in a speech to British bankers last week, said: &quot;The early phases of the autumn pay bargaining season give grounds for concern. There is a danger that wage negotiators will be unduly influenced by temporary elements in the retail price index. My fear is that such a reaction would extend the current setback to progress on the inflation front.&quot;    The problem for the government is that as long as it sticks to believing that only market forces should dictate wage levels, there is little it can do directly to hold down pay increases. &quot;The only weapon they have is to sit on the economy hard and put a profit squeeze on British industry,&quot; Mr. Martin said.    The government already has lifted the base rate, the interest rate British banks charge their best customers, to 12% from 7.5% in June.    And some economists say the government itself isn't setting a good example. Earlier this month, nurses in the state-run national health system won a 15.3% pay boost.    Though most of the settlements won't come until next spring, the trend for the manufacturing industry could be set next month, with pay talks for British Aerospace PLC's Rover Group, which has 27,000 auto workers, and Jaguar PLC, with 10,000 workers. Last year, Rover workers received a pay increase of only 3%. Nigel Richardson, an economist at Warburg Securities, said Rover management will find it almost impossible to hold wages down at that level.    Mr. Richardson said Rover workers might push for an increase of more than 8%, which is what the 32,500 workers at Britain's largest auto maker, Ford Motor Co., will be getting this year as part of a two-year contract giving them the inflation rate plus 2.5 percentage points.    Jaguar workers received raises of between 5.2% and 7.4% last year, Mr. Richardson said, but they might receive less this year because of lower profits at the luxury auto maker.    Also next month, about one million engineers spread throughout all industries will be seeking to improve on average pay increases over the past three years of about 5%. Mr. Richardson said they could be successful, because of acute shortages of skilled labor in Britain. And a total of about 150,000 coal miners at the country's state-owned mines also will settle their wages for the next year; last year, an increase of 4.2% was imposed, after unions refused to accept management offers.    The miners used to be a barometer for pay settlements in all professions, economists say, but now they are of marginal importance, because the industry is in decline and the government busted their unions' power in a prolonged and bitter strike in 1984.    The roots of the peculiarly British system of an annual pay round lie in the 1960s, when Labor Party governments made it a main part of their economic management. At the time, Labor governments were committed to creating a &quot;corporatist&quot; state, in which government, unions and industry would cooperate.    &quot;There was a time in the '70s when financial markets would lurch from one pay settlement to the next,&quot; recalled Warburg's Mr. Richardson.    But &quot;income policies went out the window when the present government came in in 1979,&quot; said Warburg's chief economist, Ian Harwood. The Conservative government under Margaret Thatcher sought only to target the growth of money supply, while the rampant unemployment that ensued in the early 1980s, as well the government's successful efforts to curb the power of the unions, ensured that wages didn't grow as fast as before.    Consequently, watching the annual round of pay settlements went &quot;out of fashion&quot; until this year's inflation worries revived interest, Mr. Harwood said. </TEXT></DOC>
