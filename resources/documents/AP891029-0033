About 2.3 million citizens were eligible to vote for the new80-member City Council, which in turn elects a mayor. Severalnewspapers expressed concern about a possible low turnout due todissatisfaction with city politicians.   Since July, Rome has been run by a special commissioner named bythe national government, because Christian Democrat Mayor PietroGiubilo resigned in the wake of charges he steered city contractsto friends. He denied he had done anything wrong.   Voting booths were open from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday and from 7a.m. to 2 p.m. Monday. Preliminary results were expected Mondayevening.   The campaign was dominated by debate over a call by a topVatican administrator to vote for Italy's only RomanCatholic-affiliated party, the Christian Democrats.   Despite the request by Cardinal Ugo Poletti, the papal vicar forRome, the Christian Democrats were expected to drop from the 33percent of the vote they obtained in city elections in 1985.   The Christian Democrats have dominated Italian national politicssince World War II, and a poor showing in Rome would be a setbackfor Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti, a Christian Democrat whoseclose allies have headed the city's coalition governments in recentyears.   Reflecting the importance of the vote, Andreotti and othernational party leaders stumped for mayoral candidates.   Voters could choose from nearly 1,500 candidates for citycouncil, divided into 23 parties, ranging from Socialists to agroup called Rock for Growth. They also voted for local governmentcouncils.   Reflecting increased voter concern about the environment, theGreens party was expected to surge from the 2.7 percent of the voteit captured in the 1985 elections.   The Communists, Italy's second-biggest party who governed Romefor the first time from 1976 to 1985, were expected to get lessthan the 30.8 percent they had in the 1985 polls.   The Socialists, the second-biggest party in the nationalcoalition government, hoped to improve from the 10.3 percent theyclinched in 1985.   Other issues prominent in the campaign were Rome's severetraffic problem, pollution and social services.   In an apparent effort to catch the imagination of disgruntledvoters, political parties led their lists of candidates withfigures of national standing, including government ministers.   They also focused more on personality, emphasizing the topcandidates on the list _ the would-be mayors _ rather than simplyplugging the party's general ideology, as is the custom in Italianpolitics.   About 88 percent of eligible voters cast ballots in the lastmayoral elections.</TEXT></DOC>
