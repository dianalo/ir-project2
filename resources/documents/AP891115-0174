Pompliano, president of MFS, which isbased in the Chicago suburb of Oakbrook Terrace, Ill.   Currently the regional Bell and other operating companiesprovide local phone access for all long-distance carriers. Nearly50 cents of every dollar spent on long-distance services goes tothe Bell companies for access fees, totaling about $20 billion ayear.   Pompliano said his company was asking the Justice Department``to enforce the Modified Final Judgment to require that localaccess ... be `unbundled' to the fullest extent possible to permitfair and equitable competition.''   Also, he said, ``we are asking the FCC to mandate thatalternative local telecommunications carriers can cost-effectivelyinterconnect'' and locate equipment at Bell facilities.   ``That means MFS and similar alternative carriers can installtheir equipment in Bell-owned switch sites and hook up to the usercommunity via the Bell network,'' Pompliano said.   Commenting on the announcement, A. Gray Collins, Bell Atlanticsenior vice president for external affairs, said: ``MetropolitanFiber is free to use Bell Atlantic's services any way it wants, andit is free to connect its own network with Bell Atlantic's.''   ``Metropolitan Fiber, however, is demanding more than this. Itis demanding collocation, which is, in effect, the ability to setup their shop in our store. Bell Atlantic has no legal obligationto do this, but it has agreed to meet a number of Metropolitan'srequests,'' Collins said.   Bill McCloskey, a spokesman for BellSouth, said about the MFSaction: ``These petitions appear to propose more confusion in thetelephone industry. They do not appear to offer any new servicesthat residential customers might use'' but instead appear``designed to benefit only high-volume users of specializedbusiness services.''   Bob Jasinski, public relations manager for NYNEX, commented:``The announcement by Metropolitan Fiber Systems simply confirmsthe fact that there's growing competition in the telecommunicationsmarkets served by the regional holding companies.''   He added that ``NYNEX stands ready to consider any reasonablerequests for interconnection that will help ensure customer demandsare met.''   MFS currently operates fiber optic communication networks inChicago, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, Minneapolis and SanFrancisco, with networks in Los Angeles and Houston to be completedby the end of this year. The company also is planning to constructnetworks in Pittsburgh, Dallas, New York and Washington.   Pompliano said ``the problem with having a single supplierexclusively control the local access business is that the lack ofcompetition provides no incentive to be responsive to customerneeds, offer new services, or lower rates.''   ``If alternative local telecommunications carriers like MFS areallowed to offer access services, technology will improve ahead ofcurrent projections and the rates for local access will drop,'' theMFS chief said.</TEXT></DOC>
