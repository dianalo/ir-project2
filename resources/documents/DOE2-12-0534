A heavy-ion beam probe has been plannedfor the ATF torsatron at Oak Ridge National Laboratory with the primarygoal of providing direct measurements of the plasma potential radialprofile and thus of the radial electric field. The complex ATF geometryand magnetic field structure present a diagnostic environment more challengingthan that found on previous beam probe systems which have operated ontokamaks, mirrors, and bumpy tori. Particular attention has been givento system alignment and control capabilities. Since the probing ion trajectoriesremain essentially the same with or without the plasma, an in situ calibrationscheme using suitable ionization targets is possible. Installation ofthe complete diagnostic system is planned for 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
