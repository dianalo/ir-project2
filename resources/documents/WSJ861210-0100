That was two years ago, and it led to guest appearances by N'Dour on a pair of the top current pop LPs, Gabriel's &quot;So&quot; and Paul Simon's &quot;Graceland.&quot; It also helped the Senegalese singer/percussionist get an album of his own released for the first time in the U.S. And it's brought the 27-year-old and his ebullient 12-member band, the Super Etoile de Dakar, here as the exotic opening act on Gabriel's sold-out tour.    &quot;I hope that having him on the tour will help open people's minds,&quot; says Gabriel. &quot;I think it's a pretty hard nut that watches Youssou and doesn't get moved.&quot;    That was certainly true the previous evening, the first of two shows here at the Spectrum. (The Gabriel tour's final concerts are Friday and Saturday at San Francisco's Cow Palace and Monday and Tuesday at the Los Angeles Forum.) Being the opener on a rock bill is always tough, as Gabriel knows -- in 1980 he was booed off the stage opening for Frank Zappa in Bremen, West Germany. It's even tougher if, like N'Dour, your English is practically nonexistent and you're going to be singing in Wolof, a West African tribal language. And when the audience is not the sympathetically predisposed group one might find at an ethnic festival but 18,000 teens antsy for the star they'd been seeing all summer on MTV, it's rougher still.    Youssou's intense 30-minute set, a blur of musicians and dancers in parrot-bright costumes bobbing and whirling to the propulsive polyrhythms, was received remarkably well. The spectators clapped along. They cheered the kung-fu kicks of Ablaye Seck and the Tina Turner-style bumps and grinds of Marietou Kote. They whooped at Assane Thiam's fleet-fingered solo on the tiny &quot;tama,&quot; or talking drum. And, in response to N'Dour's brief English greeting, they even shouted back the Wolof word for hello: &quot;Nangadeff!&quot;    When N'Dour returned two hours later to join Gabriel for an extended version of &quot;In Your Eyes,&quot; the soaring ballad they sing together on &quot;So,&quot; it was the emotional climax of the concert, leaving the roaring audience on its feet and the performers literally jumping for joy.    N'Dour was happy, but there's no reason to think he was surprised. In Senegal he's been a superstar, the superstar, for years. Music is N'Dour's birthright -- on his mother's side he comes from a long line of &quot;griots,&quot; or troubadours, the singer explains in French between sips of hot chocolate during a pre-performance interview. As a child in the capital city of Dakar, N'Dour says, he began singing with his griot grandmother. Despite his father's opposition, he had his first hit at 15. But what really put N'Dour on the map -- and onto cassettes that made their way to even the remotest villages -- was the heady new blend of popular music he devised: &quot;mbalax.&quot;    The heart of mbalax is the beat -- the name itself is Wolof for a rhythm -- specifically the driving dance beats played by the 10-member percussion ensembles N'Dour heard as a youngster. His inspiration was to reassign some of these rhythm parts to other instruments, including electric guitars, keyboards and even brass.    Horn fanfares give some of the compositions a decided salsa spice -- no wonder, since N'Dour says Cuban music was tremendously popular in Senegal when he was growing up. There are also echoes of calypso, '60s soul music, and jazz. But what really makes N'Dour's mbalax unique is his voice.    Wolof speakers can understand he's singing about subjects ranging from imprisoned South African leader Nelson Mandela (the title track on his just-released Polygram album, &quot;Nelson Mandela&quot;) to the joys and rigors of Senegalese life. The rest of us experience him as an exotic, elemental force. His soulful melisma derives from the muezzin's call to prayer (like 80% of his countrymen, N'Dour is a Moslem). At climactic moments he straddles the border between exaltation and keening. Says Gabriel's drummer, Manu Katche, a Parisian whose father comes from the Ivory Coast: &quot;When he sings you can see sand in your eyes. It's another country, another world.&quot;    And that other world is exactly what Peter Gabriel wanted to bring to his fans. He says: &quot;I think musicians like myself who are interested in the music of other cultures have a responsibility to try to popularize the music we are taking from and being inspired by.&quot; Gabriel compares his own use of exotic rhythms with the way Picasso employed the African mask. The rock star has organized the World of Music, Arts, and Dance Festival in Britain to call attention to non-Western artists.    Now, in the wake of the all-star &quot;Sun City&quot; anti-apartheid album, his own efforts and those of Paul Simon, whose Top-10 LP &quot;Graceland&quot; features Soweto township jive musicians, Gabriel hopes the time is right for Youssou and other African artists to reach a broader audience.    It seems to be. Randall Grass of Shanachie Records, which imports a spectrum of ethnic music to the U.S., says the pace of his label's sales of &quot;m'baqanga&quot; (Zulu jive) has already more than doubled since word got out about the Simon album.    But there are few sure things in the music business. Ruben Blades's record company was left with little more than crossover dreams after his 1985 Spanish-language album &quot;Escenas&quot; -- despite an avalanche of good press and a movie tie-in. In N'Dour's case, reaching a mass market could require compromises the Senegalese star and his management aren't willing to make; they've already turned down a popular late-night TV show that wanted N'Dour to perform a song in phonetic English. As Gabriel cautions, &quot;Part of what is good about Youssou's music is that it is different from mainstream.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
