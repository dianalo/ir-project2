Desert tortoises belonging to theSonoran population remaining in their natural range in Arizona (south andeast of the Colorado River) and in Mexico are not covered by this proposedrule.An emergency rule was published on August 4, 1989, listing the Mojave populationof the desert tortoise as an endangered species which expires on August2, 1990. An emergency situation in the form of a recently documented outbreakof a virulent respiratory disease, currently known as Upper RespiratoryDisease Syndrome (Respiratory Disease Syndrome), has been identified andhas caused significant declines to certain tortoise subpopulations andthreatens to become pandemic in subpopulations already stressed as a resultof habitat degradation, predation, and other factors. The Beaver Dam Slopedesert tortoise is proposed to be upgraded from threatened to endangeredwith the critical habitat remaining as previously designated.

The Berlandier's tortoise(<T3>G. berlandieri</T3>) is found in northeastern Mexico and southern Texas.The gopher tortoise (<T3>G. polyphemus</T3>) is found in the hot, humid portions of southeasternUnited States. <T3>G. agassizii</T3> is relatively large, with adults measuring up to15 inches in shell length and inhabits the Mojave, Colorado, and Sonorandeserts in the southwestern United States and adjacent Mexico.Recent studies based on shell shape and variations in genetic compositionindicate that the desert tortoise has two distinct populations, one ofwhich is divided into two subpopulations (Spang et al. 1988). A summaryof this information is as follows:The Colorado River has been an effective geographic barrier, isolatingthe Mojave and the Sonoran populations for millions of years. The Mojavepopulation is found to the west and the north of the river and the Sonoranpopulation is found to the east and south. The Mojave population is furtherdivided into two subpopulations.The western Mojave subpopulation includes parts of the west Mojave, eastMojave, and Colorado Deserts in California and extreme southern Nevada.Tortoises occur in creosote bush (<T3>Larrea tridentata</T3>), cactus, and shadscale (<T3>Atriplex confertifilia</T3>) scrub habitats, and Joshua tree (<T3>Jucca brevifolia</T3>) woodlands (Dodd 1986).Study plot data from eight sites in the western Mojave region indicatethat populations have declined at rates of 10 percent or more per yearfor the last six to eight years. Vandalism, collections, raven predation,and disease are a few of the many factors that have resulted in populationdeclines. Habitat conditions have deteriorated and/or habitat has beenlost in certain localities due to urban, energy, and mineral development,vehicle-oriented recreation, grazing, military activities, and other uses.The eastern Mojave subpopulation includes tortoises in eastern California,southern Nevada, and the Beaver Dam Slope and the Virgin River Basin ofsouthwestern Utah and extreme northwestern Arizona (north of the ColoradoRiver). Eastern Mojave tortoises occur in creosote bush-burro bush (<T3>Ambrosia dumosa</T3>) or creosote bush-Joshua tree vegetation types.Downward trends in this subpopulation and its habitat are believed to bea result of urban development, long-term livestock grazing, mining, large-scalewater development, off-road vehicle use, collecting, military activities,and many other human-related uses.The Sonoran population is found in Arizona, south and east of the ColoradoRiver, and in Mexico. Tortoises in this area are found predominantly onsteep, rocky slopes of mountain ranges, primarily in Arizona upland vegetationdominated by palo verde and saguaro cactus. The distribution of the presentpopulation and habitat is disjunct. Some habitat has been lost to expansionof urban areas. Grazing, mining, and fire have adversely affected someareas of tortoise habitat.The Beaver Dam Slope subpopulation of the Mojave population of desert tortoisesin Utah was listed as threatened with critical habitat on August 20, 1980(45 FR 55654).The Service received a petition on September 14, 1984, from the EnvironmentalDefense Fund, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Defenders of Wildlifeto list the desert tortoise in Arizona, California, and Nevada as endangeredunder the Endangered Species Act. The Service determined in September 1985that the proposed listing of the tortoise within the three petitioned Stateswas warranted but precluded by other listing actions of higher priorityunder authority of section 4(b)(3)(B)(iii) of the Act. Annual findingsof warranted but precluded have been made in each subsequent year since1985 under authority of section 4(b)(3)(C) of the Act.Data collection on the Mojave population in recent months indicate thatmany local tortoise subpopulations throughout the range of the specieshave declined precipitously. The rapid spread of Respiratory Disease Syndrome,rarely seen before in wild tortoises, has been identified as a significantcontributing factor in the current high level of tortoise losses.On May 31, 1989, the same three environmental organizations that petitionedthe Service in 1984 provided substantial new information and again petitionedthe Service to list the desert tortoise as an endangered species throughoutits United States range under the expedited emergency provisions of theAct. This second petition, treated by the Service as a petition under theAdministrative Procedure Act, was received on June 2, 1989. In responseto this petition, the Service conducted an extensive review of existinginformation on the Respiratory Disease Syndrome, other reported diseasesin Arizona, and the current status of the tortoise. As a result of thisand other information, the Service determined the Mojave population ofthe desert tortoise to be an endangered species under an emergency rulepublished on August 4, 1989 (54 FR 32326). The emergency rule providesprotection under the Act for the Mojave population of tortoises for 240days (until April 2, 1990). The Service did not take emergency action toreclassify the Beaver Dam Slope subpopulation in Utah to endangered becauseit is already protected by the Act.This proposal constitutes the final finding on the petitioner's requestto list the desert tortoise throughout its range in the United States asan endangered species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species</ITAG>Section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations promulgated to implement the listingprovisions of the Act (50 CFR part 424) set forth the procedures for addingspecies to the Federal list. A species may be determined to be an endangeredor threatened species due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). The Act defines species to include subspecies and anydistinct population segment of any species of vertebrate fish or wildlifethat interbreeds when mature. The factors and their application to theMojave population of the desert tortoise are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof its Habitat or RangeAs indicated above, habitat is deteriorating and has been lost in manyparts of the tortoise's range due to an accelerating rate of urban, energy,and mineral development, military activities, vehicle-oriented recreationalactivities, grazing, and land exchanges.For an animal such as the tortoise, which must consume its annual foragerequirement in no more than five months out of the year (March to June,and September), it is apparent that meeting this need can become criticalif forage has not been produced, is unavailable, or is of poor nutritivequality.Changes in perennial vegetation, especially the reduction in cover of smalland large shrubs and perennial grasses, are believed to be the result ofcattle and sheep grazing pressures. These changes have created openingsand barren areas in the desert landscape and have deteriorated the qualityof habitat for the tortoise. Losses of plant cover may contribute to theexcessive raven predation on small tortoises, making the tortoise moreexposed and vulnerable as raven prey.Changes in annual vegetation, also thought to be mostly connected to grazing,have also affected food supplies for tortoises. Weedy plant species thathave been introduced for grazing, such as red brome (<T3>Bromus rubens</T3>), filaree (<T3>Erodium cirutarium</T3>), and abu mashi (<T3>Schimus arabicus</T3>), can germinate, flower, and fruit before nativeplants. Native plant species are essential to meet the nutritional needsof the tortoise and are their favored forage. Exotic, weedy plant speciesare outcompeting many native plant species (Berry 1988). Additional potentialadverse impacts to the tortoise from cattle and sheep grazing include:damage to shrubs used for tortoise shelter, crushing of burrows and nests,and trampling of young tortoises. The degree and nature of impacts fromcattle grazing are dependent upon habitat, grazing history, seasons ofuse, stocking rates, and density of the tortoise population (Sievers etal. 1988).Livestock grazing is thought to be a factor contributing to tortoise habitatdegradation in portions of all four States covered by this proposed rule:Nevada, Utah, Arizona, and California. No formal research has been conductedin Nevada on effects of livestock grazing on tortoises. However, both theFinal Statement for the Proposed Domestic Livestock Grazing ManagementProgram for the Caliente Area, Nevada, and the Final Environmental ImpactStatement for the Clark County, Nevada Grazing Program concluded that conflictsbetween livestock and desert tortoises would be reduced by grazing reductionsand/or livestock removal during portions of the growing season (Bureauof Land Management (BLM) 1979, BLM 1982).One BLM-funded research study on the Crescent Peak grazing allotment inPiute Valley near Searchlight, Nevada in 1983, concluded that an observeddie-off of tortoises was ``aggravated by the long-term grazing intensitythat had occurred in the area'' (Mortimer and Schneider 1983). An unusuallyhigh mortality rate in desert tortoises was found while the authors wereinvestigating a permanent tortoise study plot in the valley. The plot islocated in an ephemeral pasture used by livestock in the winter and earlyspring. From the data collected, the authors inferred that a major populationchange of tortoises occurred between 1979 and 1983. The population sustaineda very high mortality rate (23.8 percent) with a resultant decline in thenumber of sexually mature individuals. Heavy spring grazing pressure hadoccurred for several years before 1980 and little or no annual forage wasproduced on the allotment in 1980 and 1981. The authors concluded thatthe decade of spring grazing had reduced the quality of the habitat andthe ability of the tortoises to withstand the drought years of 1980 and1981, even when cattle were not turned into the pasture during those years.The Goffs tortoise study plot is located 26 miles to the south of the PiuteValley site and in 1980 was estimated to have a 2 percent annual mortalityrate (Turner and Berry 1984). The major difference between the two plotsis that the Goffs site is not grazed. The tortoises on that site were ableto withstand the adverse weather conditions because they were in betterphysical condition than those in Piute Valley.The majority of Utah's Beaver Dam Slope allotment is in the Southern DesertShallow Hardpan Range Site as identified by the Soil Survey of WashingtonCounty (United States Department of Agriculture 1977). The potential vegetationfor this site is approximately 15 to 25 percent grasses, 2 to 5 percentforbs, and 40 to 80 percent shrubs. If the site is in excellent condition,the total annual production of air-dried herbage available as forage isabout 400 pounds per acre in good moisture years and 250 pounds per acreunder poor moisture years. The median production of annuals on the BeaverDam Slope between 1980 and 1986 was 83 pounds per acre; half of the timeforage production was more and half of the time it was less. The mean (average)production of annuals during that time period was 191 pounds per acre.It is possible that the forage requirements of the tortoise may never bemet on the Beaver Dam Slope. The BLM (BLM 1987) stated that 47 percentof the Beaver Dam Slope allotment is considered to be in fair forage conditionwhile 53 percent is in poor forage condition. This estimate was based ondesirable forage for livestock, and hence tortoises because of the dietaryoverlap. Additionally, the overall range trend has been static, no improvementhas occurred.Another important facet of tortoise feeding behavior is food preferences.Like livestock, tortoises prefer some plants over others and will go outof their way to consume them even if the plant is in low abundance. Coombs(1977b) observed in his study on the Beaver Dam Slope that bush muhly (<T3>Muhlenbergia porteri</T3>) was sought out more than any other planteven though it was one of the least available. This perennial grass hasbeen greatly reduced in abundance by livestock grazing (Stoddart et al.1975). The second most important plant was cheatgrass (<T3>Bromus tectorum</T3>) and was also one of the least common plants availableto the tortoise. Minden (1980) found that a milk-vetch (<T3>Astragulus nuttallianus</T3>) was by far the most commonly consumedplant in his study (59 percent). This annual plant was not mentioned byCoombs (1977). Apparently, the year of Minden's study (1980) was one ofabove normal rainfall which allowed this annual forb to grow. It is, therefore,believed that the tortoise has food preferences and that total forage productionis not an accurate gauge of food availability.In Arizona, the habitat of the Mojave population of tortoises has experiencedalteration of plant species composition and density. This floristic changehas been attributed, in part, to livestock grazing. The area has been overgrazedby cattle, sheep, and horses since the 1850's. Examination of livestockuse in some of this area plus changes in plant densities and species compositionindicate that adequate nutritional forage for tortoises may be lackingbecause of past overgrazing practices (Hohman and Ohmart 1978).Vehicle free-play in tortoise habitat results in cumulative adverse impactto tortoise habitat. Impacts vary from minor habitat alteration and vehicleroute proliferation to total denudation of extensive areas created by intensivevehicle play, parking, and camping. Concentrated vehicle play areas mayeliminate all but the most hardy shrubs. Other impacts include soil compactionand erosion. Tortoises suffer from loss of forage, loss of vegetative cover,and loss of burrow sites and then become subject to increased mortalityfrom crushing, collection, and vandalism (Sievers et al. 1988).The increasing use of off-road vehicles appears to be having a significanteffect on tortoise abundance and distribution. Not only may direct mortalityresult through crushing of tortoises either above ground or in their burrows,but the desert ecosystems may be degraded as a result of off-road vehicleuse (Luckenbach 1982). Growth of annuals and herbaceous perennials maybe severely reduced. The basic energy fixation and transfer systems ofthe desert can be disrupted or destroyed by vehicular activities. The tortoisesin the St. George area of Utah are particularly vulnerable because of theirproximity to an expanding urban population.Competitive off-highway vehicle racing events adversely impact tortoisehabitat. They often involve several hundred race participants and thousandsof spectators. The camping and race start and finish areas receive intensivevehicle use and become devoid of vegetation. Tortoises are eliminated fromthese areas entirely due to the loss of food, cover, and burrow sites.Affected areas become enlarged with continued use (Sievers et al. 1988).Competitive off-highway vehicle racing events have adversely impacted tortoisehabitat in Nevada. Vehicles operated by racers and pit crews, as well asspectators, have been known to cut across desert habitat off-road, andracers frequently pass other vehicles in vegetated areas (Burge 1986; U.S.Fish and Wildlife Service 1989).Vehicle route proliferation has occurred in many areas and can result ina significant cumulative loss of habitat. Human access increases the incidenceof tortoise mortality from collection, gunshot, and crushing by vehicles.Soil compaction results in loss of vegetation and increases in erosion(Sievers et al. 1988).Road construction and vehicle use appear to have a long-ranging impacton the tortoise. Besides the immediate loss of tortoise habitat from roadconstruction, paved roads and vehicular traffic affect tortoise populationswithin about one kilometer (km) (0.62 mile) of a road. For new roads, theextent of impact is up to 0.4 km (0.29 mile) away, while older roads mayreduce tortoise numbers up to 2 km (1.24 miles) away (Nicholson 1978).Large surface disturbances (e.g., power plants, mining, agricultural developments,military activities, and urbanization) cause long-term, permanent lossof habitat. Both large and small developmental activities often inducefurther surface disturbing activities with resulting habitat loss and tortoisepopulation reduction. Increased human activity results in increased vehiclekills, vandalism, and collecting of tortoises (Sievers et al. 1988).The metropolitan Las Vegas, Nevada, area has experienced rapid expansionin recent years, climbing from 241,000 people in 1980 to 335,000 in 1987;an increase of 28 percent (Walker and Cowperthwaite 1988). In the fouryears between 1982 and 1986, 10,000 acres of desert (tortoise habitat)were converted to urban uses (Clark County Department of ComprehensivePlanning, pers. comm. 1989). City and county planners assume the ultimatelimits of growth are set at the effective topographic limits of construction;planning maps indicate that the metropolitan area could eventually coverapproximately 390 square miles (Clark County Regional Flood Control District1986).In northeast Arizona, additional habitat loss and fragmentation has occurredfrom mining, off-road vehicle activities, road and powerline constructionand maintenance, agricultural development, and commercial, residential,and recreational developments. Currently, there is a proposal to develop2,000 acres of tortoise habitat near Littlefield, Arizona for commercialpurposes. Other developments are also planned for this area. Long-termplans call for development of a community of 250,000 people in the Littlefieldarea. Other potential habitat degradation activities include a BLM proposalfor a utility corridor alternative across the Beaver Dam Slope in Arizonathat would be two miles wide.Land exchanges may result in habitat loss and increased fragmentation ofpopulations. Even where tortoise habitat is exchanged by the BLM for othertortoise habitat, there is an increased likelihood of development, resultingin loss of habitat, on the new private holdings (Sievers et al. 1988).Three thousand sixty seven acres of moderate tortoise density lands, westof Las Vegas, Nevada, were recently transferred from BLM to Summa Corporation.The Desert Tortoise Council (Council) estimated that from 300 to 800 tortoiseswould be displaced by the exchange, and 3,470 acres of crucial tortoisehabitat, as defined by the Council, would be lost to private development(Desert Tortoise Council 1987).Recent legislation directs the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) tosell 3,700 acres of moderate-to-high tortoise density lands, 20 miles northeastof Las Vegas, to Clark County. The Secretary is also authorized to offerfor sale up to 17,000 additional acres in the same area (Pub. L. 101-67.Apex Project, Nevada Land Transfer and Authorization Act of 1989. July31, 1989). B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes Desert tortoises have long been a popular pet in the southwest. It is notcurrently known to what extent collecting has impacted wild populations.It is estimated that at least 100,000 desert tortoises exist in captivity.Many tortoises held in captivity, however, are known to exhibit signs ofthe contagious Respiratory Disease Syndrome. The release of diseased captivetortoises is considered by the BLM to be the source of introduction ofthe currently identified Respiratory Disease Syndrome found in wild populations.Vandalism, including shooting and crushing of tortoises under vehicles,has been documented by the BLM and is considered a factor in reducing thenumber of tortoises in their natural habitat. BLM studies in the westernMojave Desert of California on 11 permanent study plots showed 14.3 percentof the carcasses with evidence of gunshot. At one plot, carcasses withevidence of gunshot was as high as 28.9 percent (Sievers et al. 1988).Loss of tortoises from vandalism has also been reported in northwest Arizona.Approximately 10 percent of shell remains from a tortoise study plot nearLittlefield, Arizona, had gunshot wounds (Charles Pregler, BLM 1989). Luckenbach (1982) concluded that human activity is the most significantcause of tortoise mortality. The Beaver Dam Slope subpopulation of theMojave tortoise population has been subjected to collecting pressure inthe past, and although the species is now protected in Utah, some collectingmay still occur. On the Beaver Dam Slope in Arizona, heavy collection forthe pet trade took place until the 1970s (Coombs 1977). Automotive stationspaid children to collect tortoises and sold them to passing motorists (Coombs1977a). C. Disease or PredationPredation of young tortoises by ravens (<T3>Corvus corax</T3>) is a growing threat to the species. Common ravenpopulations in the southwestern deserts have increased significantly sincethe early 1940's, presumably in response to expanding human use of thedesert. Sewage ponds, landfills, power lines, roads, and other uses haveincreased available foraging, roosting, and nesting opportunities for ravens.In recent years, raven predation on juvenile desert tortoises has increasedto a point where recruiting of young tortoises into the adult populationhas been significantly reduced or eliminated in certain localities. Ravensare highly adaptable as to their feeding patterns, and concentrate on easilyavailable seasonal food sources such as juvenile tortoises, including live,healthy animals. In the Desert Tortoise Natural Area, a protected areaof 21,320 acres in the western Mojave Desert in California, even thoughtortoise eggs are still being laid and hatched, as shown by the presenceof very small tortoises, raven predation appears to have severely curtailedthe recruitment of the young into the adult population (BLM 1989). The BLM's 1989 Environmental Assessment (BLM 1989) for the Selected Controlof the Common Raven to Reduce Desert Tortoise Predation in the Mojave Desert,California, further summarizes the annual trend (percent annual change)and the change (percent) of raven numbers in the last 20 years. In theMojave Desert, raven populations have increased 1528 percent between 1968and 1988, at a rate of nearly 15 percent per year. In the Colorado-SonoranDeserts, raven populations have increased 474 percent in 20 years, at arate of over 9 percent per year. In the Great Basin Desert, raven populationshave increased by 168 percent in the last 20 years, at a rate of over 5percent per year. In the Southern California Basin, raven populations haveincreased by 328 percent, at a rate of over 7.5 percent per year. In 1989, BLM funded a tortoise study at the Piute Valley study plot inNevada. Preliminary indications include a relatively large number of youngtortoise mortalities due to ravens. The carcasses have not yet been extensivelyexamined in the laboratory. Evidence of raven predation on young tortoisesat another study plot (Christmas Tree Pass in Nevada) was observed in 1986,as evidenced by tortoise remains around a raven nest and roost site (SidSloan, BLM, pers. comm. 1989). Predation studies on the Mojave population of the tortoise in Arizona havenot been formally conducted. The proximity of tortoises to local dumpsand a dairy, however, indicates that increased predation by ravens on juveniletortoises, if not already a problem, may result in increased mortalityof tortoises in the future.  A new threat to certain desert tortoise subpopulations has recently beenidentified. A fatal disease, currently referred to as Desert Tortoise RespiratoryDisease Syndrome, has been observed in animals in a number of widely dispersedlocations throughout the Mojave Desert. It currently appears to be spreadingand the mature, reproductively active segment of the population may bemost vulnerable. The disease has been known for some time in captive tortoises throughoutthe world (Snipes et al. 1980), although the exact cause, or etiologicalagent, has not been clearly identified. The disease is probably the resultof multiple factors working in concert. It is known that the disease maybe readily transmitted from an infected tortoise to a non-infected tortoise(Rosskopf 1988). A virus (herpes-like) has been observed by electron microscopicstudies in other species of turtles with respiratory tract infections (Jacobsonet al. 1986). A paramyxovirus is also considered as a primary pathogencapable of initiating the disease (Jacobson, pers. comm., in Rosskopf 1988).Infected animals may not necessarily exhibit obvious signs of the disease.Once the disease is initiated, bacteria may invade and become the primarypathological agent. <T3>Pasturella testudinatus </T3>was recently isolated from a series ofsick tortoises collected for disease study from the Desert Tortoise NaturalArea in California. Species of <T3>Pasturella </T3>bacteria are commonly associated with disease syndromesinitiated or enhanced by other predisposing factors, including poor nutrition,stress, and immune system compromise. The disease appears to be spread via physical contact between infectedand non-infected animals (Rosskopf 1988). Adult male tortoises may contactmany females in a single breeding season and, thus, the occurrence of thedisease in the adult breeding population would reinforce the conclusionthat direct nose contact during courtship activities could spread the pathogento susceptible tortoises. Once the disease is contracted, there appearsto be little chance of full recovery and the affected individual eventuallybecomes debilitated and dies. Even individuals given extensive treatmentin captivity usually succumb to the disease eventually. Furthermore, ifan individual appears to overcome the disease, relapse may occur understress conditions (Rosskopf 1988). Although the transmittance of an infectious agent from one tortoise toanother occurs by contact, the actual infection of the newly inoculatedindividual may be associated with other factors that increase its susceptibility.Some of the original information published about this disease suggesteda nutritional and/or stress-related cause with a secondary bacterial infectionof debilitated animals (Fowler 1977). The combination of an infectiousagent along with lowered resistance is typical of these types of diseasesyndromes in many other animals. Based on current knowledge of the incidence, morbidity, and the mortalityrates, the disease appears to be escalating in surveyed populations inthe western Mojave Desert. The disease was first recognized as a majorproblem in wild populations in the spring of 1988 (Fauna West WildlifeConsultants 1989). Signs of the disease were observed in up to 46 percentof adult tortoises examined during surveys of the Desert Tortoise NaturalArea in the western Mojave Desert in southern California in the springof 1988. In one portion of this range, the infection rate went from 9 percentin a 1988 survey to 52 percent of all tortoises in a 1989 survey. A lossof about 20 percent of the marked tortoise population with disease signsoccurred in one year in this plot. While not all populations surveyed have such high mortality rates, thesefigures demonstrate the potential impact the disease can have on any givenarea. Infection rates in multiple grid areas in the southern Californiastudy area range from 7 to 50 percent. The disease signs have also beenobserved in individual tortoises from a variety of populations (Berry 1989)including the Fremont Valley (50 percent infection rate), Saguara NationalMonument in Arizona (2 of 12 radio-tagged infected, and died), and BeaverDam Slope, Utah-Arizona (10 to 20 percent infection rate with high mortalityin radio-tagged animals). Interviews of personnel at veterinary hospitalsin the Las Vegas, Nevada, area by Service personnel have revealed thatmost cases of Respiratory Disease Syndrome are found in captive tortoises,but that wild tortoises have been brought in with signs of respiratorydisease. The potential exists for the Respiratory Disease Syndrome to reachepidemic proportions throughout the Mojave population. There appear tobe no natural barriers that would prevent transfer of infectious agentsfrom California subpopulations to Nevada, Utah, and Arizona subpopulationsin the Mojave desert. The release of diseased captive animals may, however,spread the disease faster than the natural movement of tortoises betweenStates. In addition to the identified respiratory disease in the Beaver Dam Slopesubpopulation of the Mojave tortoise population, an apparent nutritionaldisease causing ostesoporosis of the bones has been identified (Jarchow1988). Berry and Coffeen (1987) analyzed 100 remains of desert tortoises collectedbetween 1982 and 1986 on the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah. Almost all of theremains were collected from two permanent study plots: Woodbury-Hardy andBeaver Dam Slope. Of the 72 tortoises found on the Woodbury-Hardy plotand one off the plot, fifteen (20.6 percent) of the specimens showed thinningof the plastron and/or carapace, holes in the bone, or a honecomb structure.An additional five specimens (6.9 percent) had deformed bones (pelvic girdle)or eroded bones. Another 15 tortoises (20.6 percent) showed no evidenceof abnormalities or thinning of bones. The remaining 38 specimens (52 percent)could not be evaluated. Of the 23 tortoises from the Beaver Dam Slope plotand 5 from nearby, 9 (32.1 percent) showed evidence of thin bones and/orholes on the plastron and/or carapace or honecombing on the girdles. Nine(32.1 percent) had normal bones and an additional nine could not be classified.In 2,300 tortoise specimens observed in California, Berry found very fewcases of bone abnormality, bone disease, and thinning of bones in youngindividuals. In contrast, young to middle-aged tortoises from Utah werefound in substantial numbers with thin bones or bone disease. Dr. J. Fischer,an orthopedic surgeon, speculated that poor nutrition was the cause forthin bones and osteoporosis in young tortoises. A study by Jarchow (1987) indicated that osteoporosis (porous bones) andassociated osteomalacia (soft bones) in tortoise shells and skeletons foundon the Beaver Dam Slope could be attributed to long-term malnutrition.He suggested that the reduction in abundance of bush muhly may be the primarycause. This perennial grass is highly palatable to livestock, as well asto the tortoise. Bush muhly, once occurred in extensive stands throughoutthe southwest, but is now found only in the protection of shrubs due tograzing pressure (Cronquist et al. 1977). D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory MechanismsAll four States in which the Mojave tortoise population occurs have lawsthat provide varying levels of protection for the desert tortoise. Evenwith State protective measures, subpopulations of the tortoise have continuedto decline.State of Nevada laws concerning fish, game, and watercraft, as amended,afford limited protection to the desert tortoise. Nevada Revised Statutes(NRS), section 501.110.1(d) sets forth that reptiles must be classifiedas either protected or unprotected. NRS section 501.110.2 states that protectedwildlife may be further classified as either sensitive, threatened, orendangered. The Nevada Administrative Code (NAC), section 503.080.1(a)classifies the desert tortoise as protected and rare outside the urbanareas of Clark County (Las Vegas). NRS section 503.597, states that itis unlawful, unless with written consent of the Nevada Department of Wildlife,to transport a desert tortoise from one portion to another portion of theState or across State lines.The California Fish and Game Commission adopted a regulation change onJune 22, 1989, to amend the California Code of Regulations, section 670.5(b)(4)of title 14, to add the desert tortoise as a State threatened species.Under the Fish and Game Code, Article 3, section 2080 prohibits the importor export of endangered or threatened species. This section also indicatesthat no person shall take, possess, purchase, or sell within the State,any listed species, or any part or product thereof, except as otherwiseprovided in State law or regulation.The California Fish and Game Code, Article 4, section 2090 requires thateach State agency shall consult with the California Department of Fishand Game to ensure that any action authorized, funded, or carried out bythat State lead agency is not likely to jeopardize the continued existenceof any State listed species.On January 1, 1988, the Arizona Game and Fish Commission (Commission) prohibitedthe take of desert tortoises from the wild (Arizona Game and Fish Commission1989). The Commission also prohibits the sale of tortoises and the exportof tortoises from the State. Prior to that date, anyone with an Arizonahunting license could take and possess one tortoise for each person inthat household. No provisions have been made to permit or otherwise identifythose tortoises that were in possession prior to January 1, 1988. Thus,enforcement of the State ban on take may not be possible unless the actualtaking of a tortoise from the wild is observed. There is no State authorityin Arizona to regulate the take of desert tortoise habitat.Unlike many other States, Utah does not have special regulations designatingcertain species as either threatened or endangered, thereby affording themadditional protection. All Utah wildlife species are classified as prohibited,controlled, or noncontrolled. The desert tortoise is considered a ``prohibitedreptile'' under Utah Rule <T3>R608-3 Collection, Importation, Transportation, and Subsequent Possessionof Zoological Animals</T3> (Utah Division of Wildlife Resources 1987).Prohibited species are zoological animals that are prohibited from collection,importation, transportation possession, sale, transfer, or release becausethey pose unacceptable disease, ecological, environmental, or human healthor safety risks. No state regulations exist to stop loss of tortoise habitatthrough land development or other habitat degradative actions.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting its Continued ExistenceAn ancillary effect of continued declines in populations and loss of habitatis the fragmentation of remaining populations. Long-term survival of thesefragmented populations will be aggravated by normal random fluctuationsin the population and environment that could lead to extirpation of subpopulations.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by theMojave population of the desert tortoise in determining to propose thisrule. Based on this evaluation, the preferred action is to list the Mojavepopulation of the desert tortoise as endangered. The Act states that theterm ``endangered species'' means any species that is in danger of extinctionthroughout all or a significant portion of its range. Given the loss ofa substantial number of tortoises due to the respiratory disease, lossand degradation of habitat over much of their range, and losses due toraven predation, it is considered that some subpopulations could be extirpatedwithin one year. If the declining trend is not turned around, eventualextinction of the population may be unavoidable.<ITAG tagnum="84">Listing of Sonoran Population Still Precluded </ITAG>The Service declined to emergency list the Sonoran population of the deserttortoise in response to the petition. The rationale leading to this decisionwas as follows: 1. Historically, desert tortoises in the Sonoran population occur in numeroussmall groups, more or less patchy or disjunct, inhabiting steep-sided canyons.This habitat is less subject to disturbance than is more level terrain.2. The very patchiness of the distribution in the Sonoran population leadsthe Service to believe that the Respiratory Disease Syndrome affectingother subpopulations will not likely reach the epidemic proportions thatit has in locations like the Desert Tortoise Natural Area in California.Although a few instances of a respiratory disease have been documentedin the Sonoran population and are of concern to the Service, it appearsthat respiratory disease: (a) Is usually present in tortoise populationsto varying degrees; (b) has not shown any evidence of becoming pandemic;(c) has not been shown to be Respiratory Disease Syndrome; and (d) is currentlybeing addressed by the Service and the Arizona Game and Fish Department,who will continue to gather and evaluate data. A report on the resultsof these studies will be available in January 1991. The report will contain information needed to determine whether the Sonoranpopulation of the desert tortoise warrants listing. All available informationon distribution, abundance, and threats will be summarized. This will includereview of published and unpublished information and preparation of mapsoverlaying tortoise distribution with projected land use patterns. Resultsof field work to determine population status and trend with emphases onreproduction, disease, and mortality will be determined from revisitingpreviously sampled sites. <ITAG tagnum="84">Similarity of Appearance Treatment of the Sonoran Population </ITAG>Section 4(e) of the Endangered Species Act, as amended, provides that theSecretary of the Interior may, by regulation of commerce or taking, andto the extent he deems advisable, treat any species as an endangered orthreatened species even though it is not listed pursuant to section 4(a)(1)of the Act if he finds that: (a) Such species so closely resembles in appearancean endangered or threatened species that enforcement personnel would havesubstantial difficulty in attempting to differentiate between the listedand unlisted species; (b) the effect of this substantial difficulty isan additional threat to the endangered or threatened species; and (c) suchtreatment of an unlisted species will substantially facilitate the enforcementand further the policy of the Act. The Service finds that there are no visual differences, readily discernibleby law enforcement personnel or the general public, between the tortoisesin the Mojave and Sonoran populations, that the similarity of appearancerepresents an additional threat to the Mojave population, and that treatingthe Sonoran population as threatened due to similarity of appearance, whenlocated outside its natural range, would facilitate the enforcement ofprohibitions under the Act regarding illegal trade in or possession ofendangered Mojave desert tortoises. Treating the Sonoran population asthreatened due to similarity of appearance when outside its natural rangewould eliminate the necessity of Service special agents having to determinethe origin of each desert tortoise prior to enforcing the prohibitionsin section 9 of the Act. Inability of the Service to enforce the prohibitionsin the Act would represent an additional threat to the listed Mojave populationof the desert tortoise. By treating members of the Sonoran population oftortoises as threatened under the similarity of appearance provisions ofthe Act, when located outside their natural range, the Service believesthat enforcement problems can be minimized, while at the same time, theconservation of listed Mojave populations can be ensured. <ITAG tagnum="84">Reclassification of the Beaver Dam Slope Population from Threatenedto Endangered </ITAG>The Beaver Dam Slope population of the desert tortoise was listed as threatenedwith critical habitat in 1980. The declining trend of this population appearsto be continuing despite the protection afforded by the Endangered SpeciesAct and efforts of State and Federal agencies to reverse the downward trend.Minden and Keller (1981) surveyed a one square mile plot in the WoodburyDesert Study Area, which is located within designated critical habitatfor the tortoise in southwestern Utah. They estimated a density of 109to 136 tortoises per square mile based on the 74 live wild animals thatwere found. The average mortality rate for 1980 and 1981 was 6 percent.The same one square mile study plot was resurveyed in 1986 (Welker 1986).Preliminary results indicate an estimated reduction of over 50 percentin numbers from Minden and Keller's work in 1981. The data in Welker'sdraft report indicates that only 27 tortoises were captured within thestudy plot; i.e., 6 released captives and 21 wild tortoises. The densityof tortoises within the study area was estimated at between 34 and 47 persquare mile. The population was dominated by adult (61.9 percent) and male(77 percent) tortoises. This is a complete reversal of the sex ratios foundby Woodbury and Hardy (1948) of 36 percent males and 64 percent females.An animal population weighed heavily towards males is an indication ofa population in poor reproduction condition. The average annual mortalityrate in 1986 was 22 percent with the majority of deaths occurring in juvenileand female tortoises. This rate is considered high when compared to anaverage annual mortality rate of 1 to 5 percent in 1948; 6.86 percent byCoombs (1977b); and 6 percent in 1981. A 50 percent population decline of the desert tortoise on a study ploton the Beaver Dam Slope, Utah has been documented between 1981 and 1986.This data appears to be representative of a continuing decline of the entireBeaver Dam Slope subpopulation of Mojave desert tortoises. The Act statesthat the term ``endangered species'' means any species or vertebrate populationwhich is in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant portionof its range. As previously discussed herein, given the loss of a substantialnumber of Beaver Dam Slope tortoises due to disease, loss and degradationof habitat over much of their range, losses due to raven predation, andan escalating decline in the population, it is considered that the BeaverDam Slope subpopulation of the Mojave desert tortoise population is inimminent danger of extinction. <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary propose critical habitat at thetime a species is proposed to be endangered or threatened. Critical habitat was designated for the Beaver Dam Slope subpopulationof the Mojave desert tortoise in 1980. The status of this previously designatedcritical habitat would not be changed with this proposal. The Service finds that designation of critical habitat for the remainderof the Mojave desert population is not presently determinable. The Service'sregulations (50 CFR 424.12(a)(2)) state that critical habitat is not determinableif information sufficient to perform required analyses of the impacts ofthe designation is lacking or if the biological needs of the species arenot sufficiently well known to permit identification of an area as criticalhabitat. The range of the Mojave desert tortoises is extensive. Much ofthis habitat has been fragmented and degraded by a number of land-disturbingactivities. Some remaining areas of good habitat are isolated from eachother or are of such small size as not to support viable subpopulationsof the tortoise. The specific size and spatial configuration of these essentialhabitats, as well as vital connecting linkages between areas necessaryfor ensuring the conservation of the Mojave desert population throughoutits range, cannot be determined at this time.During the proposed comment period, the Service will seek additional agencyand public input on critical habitat, along with information on the biologicalstatus of and threats to the Mojave desert tortoise. The Service intendsto use this and other information in formulating a decision on criticalhabitat designation for the Mojave population of the tortoise.<ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures</ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withStates, and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing.Such increased recognition and conservation efforts would provide a meansto ensure survival for the desert tortoise. Available funding would beused on research to determine the causes of and possible treatments forthe disease currently infecting tortoise populations and to determine whetherthe disease can be passed on to hatchlings by infected females. Availablefunding would also be used for, but would not necessarily be limited to,the identification and isolation of healthy populations, carrying out predatorcontrol to reduce loss of immature tortoises, public education to discouragefurther releases of diseased captive tortoises, and to address habitatissues including land acquisition, fencing, and habitat improvement.The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions againsttaking and harm are discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(4) ofthe Act requires Federal agencies to confer with the Service on any actionthat is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a proposed speciesor result in destruction or adverse modification of proposed critical habitat.Regulations governing these conferences are found at 50 CFR 402.10. Ifa species is listed subsequently, section 7(a)(2) requires Federal agenciesto ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of a listed species or to destroyor adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal action may affecta listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federal agencymust enter into formal consultation with the Service.At least 50 percent of occupied habitat within the range of the Mojavepopulation of the desert tortoise is managed by the BLM. Other Federalmanagers of tortoise habitat include the Department of Defense, NationalPark Service, and the Fish and Wildlife Service. Tortoises are also foundon lands managed by Indian tribes. Federal activities may include, butmay not be limited to, actions resulting in grazing, off-highway-vehicleuse, mining, construction of developments and rights-of-way, and militaryactivities.The act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR part 17 set fortha series of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take (includes harass, harm,pursue, hunt, shoot, wound, kill, trap, capture, or collect; or to attemptany of these), import or export, ship in interstate or foreign commercein the course of a commercial activity, or sell or offer for sale any endangeredspecies in interstate or foreign commerce. It is also illegal to possess,sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship any such wildlife that has beenillegally taken. Certain exceptions apply to agents of the Service andState conservation agencies.Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife under certain circumstances. Regulations governingsuch permits are codified at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are availablefor scientific purposes, to enhance the propagation or survival of thespecies, and/or for incidental take in connection with otherwise lawfulactivities. In some instances, permits may be issued during a specifiedperiod of time to relieve undue economic hardship that would be sufferedif such relief were not available.All <T3>Gopherus </T3>tortoises, including the desert tortoise, were listedon July 1, 1975, as Appendix II species under the Convention on InternationalTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES Convention).The only exception within the genus is <T3>G. flavomarginatus, </T3>which was listed as an Appendix I species.The CITES Convention, as implemented by the Act and various regulations(50 CFR part 23), imposes restrictions on importation and exportation ofAppendix I and II species.<ITAG tagnum="84">Status of Feral Tortoises and Tortoises Currently Held in Captivity</ITAG>Feral desert tortoises, which have been released inside the native habitatof the Mojave desert tortoise, would be classified endangered species inthe area north and west of the Colorado River and would be protected underthe Act.Under section 9(b)(1) of the Act, prohibitions applicable to the Mojavepopulation will not apply to tortoises that were held in captivity or ina controlled environment on the date of the publication of the emergencyrule (August 4, 1989), provided, that such holding and any subsequent holdingor use of the tortoise was not in the course of a commercial activity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments Solicited</ITAG>The Service intends that any final action resulting from this proposalwill be as accurate and as effective as possible. Therefore, comments orsuggestions for the public, other concerned governmental agencies, thescientific community, industry, or any other interested party concerningthis proposed rule are hereby solicited. Comments particularly are soughtconcerning:(1) Biological, commercial trade, or other relevant data concerning anythreat (or lack thereof) to this species;(2) The location of any additional populations of this species and thereasons why any habitat should or should not be determined to be criticalhabitat as provided by section 4 of the Act;(3) Additional information concerning the range, distribution, and populationsize of this species; and(4) Current or planned activities in the subject area and their possibleimpacts on this species.Final action concerning this proposal will take into consideration thecomments and any additional information received by the Service, and suchcommunications may lead to a final regulation that differs from this proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, need not beprepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section 4(a)of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
