Adelman</HL><DD> 09/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   William Safire is a many-splendored thing. A witty twice-weekly columnist, learned essayist on language, and sprightly speaker, Mr. Safire has been soaking up his spare time (we now know) scrupulously scribing a 1,125-page &quot;epic novel.&quot; It takes a remarkable writer to produce &quot;Freedom: A Novel of Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War&quot; (Doubleday, $24.95), just as surely as it takes a remarkable reader to tackle it. Here truly is a book that can last a lifetime.    All these pages of teensy printed words are about the relatively short period from the first fighting of the Civil War to the final signing of the Emancipation Proclamation. But the subject is well chosen. Abraham Lincoln is forever fascinating and the Civil War forever engrossing.    Who ever said wars never settle anything? The Civil War settled the two critical issues the Founding Fathers ignored, finessed, or just plain got wrong: secession and slavery. The war determined, for all time, that the Union was indivisible and that slavery was intolerable. Confederate Gen. Sidney Johnston is quoted in &quot;Freedom&quot; saying, &quot;Not all wars are worth the cost . . . but this one is.&quot; Quite right, for it made union and freedom the hallmarks of our nation. Not bad for one war.    Not easy either. The cost in blood and iron was staggering, the loss of life wrenching. Lincoln felt it all and felt it deeply. And he inspired more biographies than anyone else in history except for Jesus Christ. There's a Lincoln biography for each four hours he occupied the White House -- undoubtedly because of his monumental achievements but also because of his piercing agony.    He was tormented by conflict all around him. There was conflict in the American family: The Southern states' secession was triggered by his actions. There was conflict in his official family: His cabinet was composed of leading politicians Lincoln had stepped over on his way to the presidency, men who squabbled and schemed endlessly. And there was conflict in his personal family: Son Robert was one of the few individuals with whom Lincoln could establish no rapport (and seemed never really to try to), and wife Mary Todd was troublesome at best and loony at worst.    Lincoln's &quot;management style&quot; would today be dismissed as woefully detached. He cared little about settling cabinet conflicts or even learning much about them. In Mr. Safire's account, Lincoln's personal secretary, John Hay, writes in his diary, &quot;The Lincoln Administration was not an administration at all, but a separate and disjointed pack of Cabinet officers, each one ignorant of what his colleagues are doing.&quot; Lincoln frittered away precious hours hearing out individuals who came to plead for jobs or pardons, and spinning out his limitless supply of prairie stories. He explained his policies more often with stories than with logic, having entered his anecdotage at an early age.    But what an iron will when it came to saving the Union! Here there was no compromising (One of Mr. Safire's characters asks another, &quot;What drives that man?&quot; and another rejoins marvelously: &quot;It's just that blind spot of his, Rose. Lincoln doesn't want to compromise, he wants to win.&quot;)    Here there was no muddled approach. Here no skimping. Others might ponder the matter -- how to reconcile our Founders' precept of self-determination with a war to deny the South's right to self-determination -- but Lincoln took union as a matter of faith. Again Mr. Safire's character gets it right: &quot;Had it not been for one man, the stubborn A. Lincoln, the war would not have come. Two nations would exist, one slave, one free.&quot;    Mr. Safire's Lincoln may not be as full a character as the hero of Gore Vidal's novel, &quot;Lincoln,&quot; but Mr. Safire's Lincoln is, as befits Mr. Safire, more cerebral. Indeed, he sets the Civil War action more in people's minds than on battlefields. The main characters are engaged in one huge debate, interminably thrashing out the meaning of constitutional provisions and the concept of democracy. Washington becomes a grand lyceum with Platonic dialogue breaking out whenever any two characters meet.    But what a fascinating dialogue it is. Mr. Safire invents wonderful discussions, time and again, throughout this masterpiece. Its sole deficiency is inherent in any historical novel: It's difficult to distinguish what is historical from what is not. Even the most dedicated Safirite will balk at slogging through the 132 pages of &quot;sources and commentary&quot; that follow the daunting 975 pages of &quot;epic novel.&quot; But in &quot;Freedom&quot; perhaps the distinction between fact and fiction is unimportant; Mr. Safire strives to present the truth and not necessarily the facts.    And this he does so marvelously that, to paraphrase the inscription of the ever-moving Lincoln Memorial: In this book, as in the hearts of those for whom he saved the Union, the memory of Abraham Lincoln is enshrined forever.    ---   Mr. Adelman is director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. </TEXT></DOC>
