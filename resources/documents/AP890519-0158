Witnesses said Chan Yih-hua was engulfed in flames when he litbottles of gasoline strapped to his waist under a black mourningvest.   Riot police doused the area with water cannons. Several mournershelped extinguish the flames with jackets and umbrellas and tookChan to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead.   Chan, in his thirties, was a member of the DemocraticProgressive Party formed three years ago, primarily by nativeTaiwanese, to oppose the governing Nationalists.   Party officials said Chan admired Cheng Nan-jung, 42-year-oldpublisher of the weekly Freedom Era, who was accused of printingseditious articles calling for permanent separation from China.   The Nationalists, who fled from the mainland to Taiwan in 1949after losing a civil war to the Communists, still claim to be thelegitimate government of all China.   Cheng died in an apartment fire April 7 after hurling firebombsat police who had come to arrest him.   Relatives and police said Cheng committed suicide. Friends saidhe had vowed to burn himself to death and become the first martyrof the Taiwan independence movement.   More than 3,000 mourners, many wearing black vests printed with``Establish New Nation,'' remained outside the presidential officebuilding Friday night for a sit-in in the rain. Thousands of riotpolice watched.   The demonstration was the largest on the island since Taiwanlifted 38 years of martial law in 1987.   Mourners, including college students and church members, urgedPresident Lee Teng-hui to allow freedom of speech, includingadvocacy of an independent Taiwan, and release all politicalprisoners.   Police said the mourners dispersed shortly after midnight,ending a demonstration that had lasted 11 hours.   Cheng's coffin was taken on a two-hour funeral processionthrough Taipei by 2,000 supporters before the memorial service.Riot police erected barbed-wire barricades to keep the crowd awayfrom the building.</TEXT></DOC>
