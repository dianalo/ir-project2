Based on heavyoil characteristics, new drilling and well completion techniques havebeen used to prevent formation damage, to minimize sand production, tosatisfy conventional oil production operating requirements, and to meethigh temperature requirements for thermal recovery operations. This articlediscusses the primary open hole gravel pack completion technique, whichwas developed to meet these requirements as well as to meet the objectivesof high production and accelerating the development of Liaohe Oil field(China). Improvements in gravel packing rate and quality are highlightedin the discussion. Reservoir damage by lack of sand control, and itseffects on productivity, are also detailed. 4 refs., 4 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
