The state news agency MTI said writer Miklos Haraszti and theother seven were detained for ``intenting to disturb'' Tuesday'sceremonies commemorating the 140th anniversary of Hungary'srebellion against Austrian rule.   After a Communist Party-organized demonstration on Tuesday, theprotesters marched down the capital's main boulevards shouting``Democracy'' and chanting slogans demanding a free press and freeelections.   Police turned out in force but did not disturb the march.   Speakers at a rally after the march criticized the Soviet system.   ``The time is over for self-appointed governments,'' leadingdissident Gabor Miklos Tamas told the crowd, referring to thenation's Communist authorities. ``A modern democracy has to becreated with a new constitution and free elections.''   Haraszti, reached by telephone from Vienna today, said he andthe other dissident intellectuals were taken to the Gyuejtoefoeghazprison outside Budapest, where Imre Nagy, premier during the 1956revolution, was executed.   ``I was picked up by police at 5 a.m. and set free aroundmidnight,'' Haraszti said. ``We were all held in separate cells.''   Haraszti said that, in days preceding Tuesday's anniversary,authorities launched a campaign to try to discourage young peoplefrom taking part.   In an attempt to keep the number of demonstrators low, he said,police searched houses, seized underground literature and visitedhigh schools, apparently to intimidate students.   He said he did not think any of the dissidents detained Tuesdayhad been fined or charged.   The others are sociologist Ottilia Solt, publisher GaborDemszky, artist Tamas Molnar, Gyoergy Gado, Jenoe Nagy and twolesser known dissidents, Sandor Racz and Robert Palinkas.   On Tuesday, the crowd marched to monuments to national heroes,paying particular tribute to firebrand poet Sandor Petoefi, whosename is symbolic of resistance to foreign domination of Hungary.   A 1948 rebellion in Hungary was put down a year later with thehelp of Russian troops. In 1956, Soviet troops again helpedsuppress a nationalist uprising.   Hungarian dissidents have staged unofficial demonstrations onMarch 15 every year since 1973. Police generally have shownrestraint, although dozens of officers clashed violently withprotesters in 1986.   Roza Demszky, wife of the detained publisher, read her husband'sspeech to the crowd. The Soviet system has led Hungary into acrisis ``and does not show any way out,'' she said.   Hungary recently has imposed an austerity program to try toreverse economic stagnation.</TEXT></DOC>
