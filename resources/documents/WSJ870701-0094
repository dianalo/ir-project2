The charge primarily reflects a decline in the value of mortgage loans in process because of a recent increase in interest rates. Other New England thrifts and banks have been reporting similar charges. In last year's second quarter, Numerica, a bank holding company, earned $1.9 million, or 43 cents a share.    Numerica also said that it broke off talks to sell its Florida-based mortgage banking company, Numerica Financial Services Inc., to a unit of Gibraltar Savings Association of Houston. The companies, which signed a letter of intent earlier this year, weren't able to reach a definitive agreement, Numerica said. A Numerica spokeswoman said the termination wasn't related to the second-quarter charge. Gibraltar Savings, a unit of closely held First Texas Financial Association, the largest savings andamp; loan holding company in Texas, declined to comment.    The bank holding company said it will continue to try to sell the mortgage-banking unit or portions of its loan-servicing portfolio because it wants to focus on New England banking. Numerica bought the Florida mortgage-banking unit three years ago. It services about $1.6 billion in loans. </TEXT></DOC>
