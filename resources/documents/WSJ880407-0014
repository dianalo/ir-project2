The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which had gained nearly 17 points Tuesday, leapt 64.16 to 2061.67. It was the sharpest rise since Jan. 4, the first session of 1988, when the average jumped 76.42 points.    Trading activity picked up along with prices. Big Board volume totaled 189.8 million shares, well above Tuesday's total of 135.3 million.    Traders said the fuel for the rally came from a report that the Group of Seven major industrial countries is likely to reaffirm 125 yen as the lower limit for the dollar at its meeting in Washington. There had been speculation that the lower boundary would be revised to about 120 yen.    The report, over Nikkei Telecom, a Japanese news service, triggered an immediate upturn in the dollar against other major currencies.    As a result, the stock market snapped back to life at midsession after drifting at slightly higher levels on light volume throughout the morning. The advance was bolstered by gains in the bond market, which took the report as a sign that the Federal Reserve may not have to tighten credit to boost the dollar, as had been feared.    The industrial average first showed a gain of more than 50 points with half an hour left in the session. This caused the Big Board to cut off use of its automated order delivery system for stock-index arbitrage and other forms of program trading. The 50-point cap was adopted in early February in response to concern about the impact of buy and sell programs on market volatility.    The restriction wasn't enough to prevent the market from adding to its gains, however, and the Dow industrial average closed at its high for the session.    Among broader market averages, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-Stock Average soared 6.98 to 265.49, and the New York Stock Exchange Composite Index surged 3.47 to 149.76. Almost 1,200 issues rose in price on the Big Board, and only about 400 fell.    John D. Connolly, research director and chairman of the investment committee at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the market's sharp advance wasn't too surprising, given the evidence that the economy has held to a pattern of moderate growth.    &quot;We have had, in the last six months, some awfully good economic news, and the market has been very, very hesitant,&quot; he said. &quot;Just based on the fundamentals, I think we were due for something like this.&quot;    Given the amount of time that has passed since last October's market crash, Mr. Connolly said investors are likely to stop waiting for &quot;the other shoe to drop&quot; -- in other words, another market collapse or a recession -- and start to take some interest in stocks. &quot;At some stage, people will start thinking that maybe there's not another shoe, that maybe both shoes dropped at the same time -- Oct. 19,&quot; he said.    Mary Farrell, a market analyst at PaineWebber, said she was less impressed with the surge in stock prices. The advance mainly reflected the market's neutral position in recent sessions and its anticipation of a major outside event, such as the Japanese news report, that would provide it with some type of direction.    &quot;The market really has been in a trading range, and that's where it's likely to stay,&quot; she said. &quot;At the level of current short-term rates, there really isn't a lot of downside risk, but at the current level of long-term rates, there's not a lot of upside potential.&quot;    Prominent gainers among blue-chip issues included General Motors, up 3 3/8 to 74; Philip Morris, up 2 5/8 to 92 3/4; Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing, up 3 3/8 to 60 7/8; Procter andamp; Gamble, up 2 3/4 to 80 3/4; and International Paper, up 2 1/2 to 45.    The Dow industrials also benefited from strength in the oil sector, with Chevron rising 2 to 47 1/2, Exxon gaining 2 to 44 and Texaco advancing 1 3/4 to 49 1/2. Among other oil stocks, Amoco was up 2 3/8 to 74 7/8, Sun Co. rose 1 7/8 to 60 1/8 and Atlantic Richfield gained 2 to 85 5/8.    Additionally, technology stocks stood out among the market's advancers. Digital Equipment jumped 2 3/4 to 105 1/2, Honeywell advanced 3 to 66 1/2, Unisys tacked on 1 1/2 to 33 7/8, Texas Instruments gained 2 1/2 to 48 1/2 and Motorola was up 2 1/4 to 46 1/4.    F.W. Woolworth fell 1 3/4 to 54 7/8 in an apparent cooling of takeover speculation. In the past two sessions, the stock had jumped a total of 11 1/2 points in response to news that a partnership led by the chairman of Dart Group is interested in buying as much as 15% of the company's shares.    Moore McCormack Resources dropped 3/4 to 39 3/4. The company accepted a $40-a-share takeover offer from Southdown, which gained 1/2 to 40 3/4.    DCNY, which reported lower first-quarter net income, fell 1 5/8 to 20 3/8. The company's net fell to $619,000, or eight cents a share, from the year-earlier $1.6 million, or 20 cents a share.    Facet Enterprises, the target of a hostile $27.50-a-share offer from Prospect Group, added 1 7/8 to 29. The company said it is holding talks with several parties interested in making an offer that would exceed Prospect's bid.    Fairchild Industries jumped 1 5/8 to 11. The company estimated that first-quarter pretax earnings from continuing operations would total $5.7 million, compared with a year-ago pretax loss of $1.5 million. Fairchild also said its 1988 net may top analysts' estimates of about $1 a share, as well as last year's net of 82 cents a share.    Alexander's advanced 4 1/4 to 54 3/4. Interstate Properties boosted its stake in the company to 24.5% through a transaction in which Interstate and New York developer Donald Trump, another major holder, bought the same number of shares.    Genentech closed at 37 1/2, up 1/2, despite an advisory by the Ontario Medical Association to member hospitals and doctors not to use Genentech's TPA anti-clotting drug for heart attacks because, at $2,000 a dose, it is too expensive.    The American Stock Exchange Index advanced 2.51 to 297.58. The average price per share rose 10 cents. Volume totaled 11.4 million shares, compared with 9.3 million Tuesday.    ---                    BIGGEST ONE-DAY GAINS    Date                   Close        Gain      %Chg    Oct. 21, 1987         2027.85     186.84     10.15    Oct. 20, 1987         1841.01     102.27      5.88    Oct. 29, 1987         1938.33      91.51      4.96    Jan. 4, 1988          2015.25      76.42      3.94    Sept. 22, 1987        2568.05      75.23      3.02    April 3, 1987         2390.34      69.89      3.01    April 21, 1987        2337.07      66.47      2.93    Dec. 14, 1987         1932.86      65.82      3.53    April 6, 1988         2061.67      64.16      3.21    Nov. 12, 1987         1960.21      61.01      3.21</TEXT></DOC>
