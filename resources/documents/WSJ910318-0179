They may, however, behelped by considering a system that has proved to beremarkably successful at my own company, and at hundreds ofother companies throughout Germany.   This nationwide mechanism is known as the Dual System forVocational Training, covering about 440 occupations. Itcombines academics and apprenticeships and is particularlygeared toward the 75% of German youngsters who will notpursue a university education. The system divides theresponsibility for training between private companies andpublic vocational training schools, with the greater portionof these activities placed in the hands of the companies.</LP><TEXT>   For instance, Siemens offers courses at 60company-sponsored centers throughout Germany. The centerstrain about 15,000 young people of both sexes, each of whomreceives nearly four years of structured specialized trainingunder the Dual System method at a cost to the company ofabout $25,000 per year per trainee.   There are also full-time Dual Training centers at 30Siemens sites outside Germany. Some 1,800 skilled workerapprentices and 300 commercial apprentices are being trainedin Mexico, Indonesia, Britain and South America.   Several years ago, Dieter Nispel, part of the teamorganizing the Siemens AG apprenticeship programs, met withhis counterparts from Siemens facilities in Sydney andMelbourne. They were highly enthusiastic about our trainingprograms as they toured several facilities and remarked thatonly a very wealthy country with a correspondingly high taxbase could possibly afford programs such as these. When theywere told that the costs are largely borne by the companiesinitiating them, their enthusiasm was clearly damped.Neverthless, subsequently the company was able to establishapprenticeship programs in Australia as well.   Ultimate responsibility for training lies with theemployer, who draws up a training contract. ThroughoutGermany, at least one million high school and post highschool students are currently enrolled in theseapprenticeship programs. Most of the sequences -- which, atSiemens, emphasize science and mathematics in preparation foradvanced instruction in such specialties as computerizednumerical control, hydraulics and personal-computertechnology -- take place at facilities operated at thecompany's expense.   In December, Volkswagen AG opened a new training center inBrunswick at a cost of 19 million deutsche marks ($12.3million). Shortly, some 550 young people will begin trainingthere for as many as 15 different career paths. JochenSchumm, head of personnel at the VW-Works, puts it this way:&quot;Training costs money; not to train costs a great deal moremoney.&quot;   The German vocational schools are rigorous in theirattention to academic content and professional discipline.Companies compete vigorously for promising apprentices, andlocal governments are serious about maintaining the qualityand reputations of their vocational schools.   Unfortunately, there is no real comparison between thevocational centers in Germany and their so-calledcounterparts in the U.S. In 1984, the U.S. General AccountingOffice tracked 1,165 private, for-profit schools receiving$185 million a year in governmental education grants. The GAOfound that nearly half the schools enrolled students whofailed to meet federally mandated admission prerequisites.   Eventually, 74% of the students dropped out withoutfinishing the courses. Nevertheless, the schools were allowedto keep millions of dollars the students received in grants.It is estimated that there are more than 100,000 of thesefor-profit schools operating in the U.S. today.   By contrast, the vocational apprenticeship programs inGermany -- and in Austria and Switzerland -- are turning outhighly skilled, technologically competent graduates who arethoroughly familiar with the flexible manufacturing systemstypical of today's industry. The dropout rate is negligiblebecause these programs are the first and necessary steptoward attaining the coveted and respected title of&quot;meister,&quot; or master craftsman, of a trade. This customarilyis a midlevel management position that is retained for life.   The training doesn't end at this point, however. In 1989,Siemens spent nearly $180 million world-wide on vocationaltraining and an additional $281 million for continuingeducation. More than 20,000 of the company's employees arecurrently enrolled in these corporate training programs,which are designed to nurture high levels ofemployee-employer interaction.   It is this interaction -- the opportunity to forge avocational and emotional identity with the company and itsgoals -- that creates a powerful sense of jointaccomplishment shared by the employee and the corporation.Graduates of the apprenticeship programs are not required tomake a long-term commitment. Yet, after 10 years, more thanhalf of the subsidized apprentices are still with Siemens.   It's my belief that a company-supported vocationaltraining program is the only way some otherwise-capable highschool graduates in the U.S. can ever hope to achievemanagerial positions in corporations. In fact, two members ofthe Siemens AG board entered the company through theapprenticeship program. With the cost of private and evenpublic colleges in the U.S. becoming prohibitive, we run therisk of excluding a large pool of talented individuals frompositions for which they may be well qualified but for whichthey lack proper training and accreditation. A vocationaltraining program fills that gap.   Curtis Plott, executive vice president of the AmericanSociety of Training and Development, has put in a nutshellthe challenge facing all of us here in the U.S.: &quot;Companiescan't just buy employees -- now they have to make them.&quot;   ---   Mr. Decker, who is based in New York, is vice chairman ofSiemens Corp., a German electronics manufacturer.</TEXT></DOC>
