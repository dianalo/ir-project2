Dodge report said.   F.W. Dodge, the forecasting unit of McGraw-Hill Inc., saidtotal construction startup rates slipped to $230.14 billionin August, from $236.31 billion in July. The seasonallyadjusted annual rate brought the Dodge index of contractvalues down to 146 from 150 the previous month, as wasexpected based on fluctuations reported since last winter'ssteep decline. The index uses 1982 as a base of 100.</LP><TEXT>   Regarding the impact of the Middle East conflict on thevalue of new construction, George A. Christie, vice presidentand chief economist for F.W. Dodge said, &quot;The risk, ofcourse, is whether higher-cost oil will tip the alreadyweakened economy into recession by next winter. Chances areit will, and that implies a secondary decline forconstruction, particularly for commercial building andhousing.&quot;   Values for both nonresidential and residential buildingeased 4% in August. Office building remained the weakestsegment, with an August rate of $77.52 billion, down from$80.34 billion in July, when the level plummeted 23% to itslowest level in a decade. Nonbuilding construction, includingpublic works and utilities, edged up 1% due to a surge ofsewer and water projects.   Through the eight months of 1990, total contracting valuesfell 8% from the year ago period. The Northeast regionremained most depressed with a 24% shortfall for the eightmonths, followed by the Southeast, which reported a 14% drop.The only gain this year was in the North Central region,which rose 3% in August.</TEXT></DOC>
