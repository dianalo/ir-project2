(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state appeals court threw out a $50million judgment won by a farmer who said a bank defrauded him byenticing him to borrow millions and then cutting off credit whenhis business went sour.   In a ruling seen as a victory for banks on the issue of ``lenderliability,'' the court Wednesday said Robert Stanghellini failed toprove the Bank of America committed fraud.   A jury in 1987 awarded Stanghellini, his elderly mother and aunt$20 million in compensatory damages and $30 million in punitivedamages. The award was reduced by $3 million, the amountStanghellini owed the bank.   Stanghellini had argued that the bank got him to borrow heavilyto expand and then cut him off after his tomato-growing businesssuffered heavy losses in the early 1980s.   The appeals court cited errors by the trial judge and misconductby Richard Murphy, Stanghellini's lawyer.   Murphy had tried to ``vilify the bank unfairly, both in and outof court'' make his case ``through sources beyond properlyadmissible evidence,'' the court said.   Murphy was unavailable for comment, a spokeswoman said Wednesday.   Recent decisions by appeals courts have reversed several rulingsagainst banks that abruptly cut off credit to long-standingcustomers who began losing money.</TEXT></DOC>
