For life diagnosis of the hydraulicturbine, the life of the component parts does not require diagnosis becauseit is usually renewed simply by replacing. 24 water turbines at 21 powerstations were so far diagnosed and their lives were predicted. A flowchart of the life diagnosis procedure and a process of predicting theresidual life of a flaw by fracture mechanics are introduced. As regardsrecent technology for rehabilitation and modernization of hydraulic turbines,explanations are made on turbine runners, wicket gates, main guide bearings,wicket gate stem bearings, shaft seal, speed governor, computer aidedflow analysis, and electric servomotors. As to the life diagnosis ofgenerators, insulation diagnosis of stator coils, lifetime evaluationby machine operating history, life evaluation by diansostic testing,life evaluation of the rotor coil, and preventive maintenance of mechanicalcomponents are briefly explained.
