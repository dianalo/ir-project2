The problem posed here is how might rules be structuredto allow for the development of biomass facilities which qualify, butwhich are not biased in favor of non-renewable resources? Such protectsare likely to have different requirements necessary for their developmentthan, for example, hydroelectric facilities. In a general comparisonof the two, biomass projects will be fuel and fuel contract dependent,less capital intensive, and more likely to be dispatchable on an annualbasis. In addition, biomass facilities may be cogenerators and have availableto them more than one revenue stream. Biomass facilities may also bemore likely than the hydros to go out of business during the term ofthe contract.</TEXT></DOC>
