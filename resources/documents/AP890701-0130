The army confirmed six of the wounded and said it wasinvestigating the other incidents.   Also Saturday, Israel television reported that Israeli embassieshave been ordered to refuse to accept information from the UnitedStates and other nations concerning their talks with the PLO.   The television quoted Energy Minister Moshe Shahal of theleft-leaning Labor Party as saying the order was an ``attempt toescape reality.''   In the occupied Gaza Strip, merchants shuttered their stores andpublic transportation ground to a halt for the second consecutiveday as Palestinians observed a commercial strike to protest Israel'sdeportation of eight Arabs.   In the strip's Jabaliya refugee camp, Arab reports said, troopsopened fire on a group of mourners visiting the family of Mohammedabu al-Nasr, a Palestinian who kidnapped American relief workerChris George last week.   George was released unharmed after almost 30 hours of captivity.The army said al-Nasr was gunned down last Wednesday by troops afterhe hijacked an Arab taxi.   Arab reports said troops on Saturday shot tear gas and later liveammunition after dozens of mourners standing outside al-Nasr's homebegan throwing stones at soldiers.   The reports said at least six Palestinians were wounded in theincident, including al-Nasr's 60-year-old uncle, Hassan abu al-Nasr.   Arab hospital officials said three other Palestinians fromJabaliya were wounded Saturday, but could not say whether theadditional wounded were connected to the incident at al-Nasr's home.   Elsewhere in Gaza, seven Palestinians including a 12-year-old boyand a 55-year-old woman were wounded by army gunfire, hospitalofficials said.   The army confirmed one wounded and said it was investigating theother incidents.   In the West Bank, troops shot and wounded eight Palestinians invarious clashes, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed atotal of five wounded.   At least 538 Palestinians have been killed and 12,000 woundedsince the Arab uprising against Israeli rule began in December 1987.Twenty-three Israelis have also been killed.   Leaders of the center-left Labor Party said they will demand thatSunday's regular Cabinet session address the Foreign Ministry'sreported order to its embassies to refuse information from theUnited States or other countries on their talks with the PalestineLiberation Organization.   Army radio said Foreign Minister Director-General Reuven Merhavsent the order Israeli embassies Friday. A Foreign Ministry officialrefused to confirm or deny the reports but said embassies havestanding orders not to receive such information.   Last April, Israel turned down an offer from France to shareinfomation on PLO chief Yasser Arafat's meeting with FrenchPresident Francois Mitterrand.   Israel considers the PLO a terrorist organization and has refusedall contact with its members.   In another development Saturday, Israeli Arabs said the PoliceMinistry has stopped recruiting them out of fear they might be toosympathetic to Palestinian protesters in the occupied territories.   Police Chief David Krauss told the Maariv newspaper Friday thatthe Palestinian uprising had ``penetrated deeply from the (occupied)territories to the Arab residents of the state of Israel.''   Israel has about 750,000 Arabs living within its borders.   Police spokesman Rafi Levy denied that Arabs were being cut outof the recruitment because of fears of divided loyalties.   ``The issue is simply that we are full,'' Levy said. ``If thereis an opening it could go to an Arab or a Jew. There will be nodiscrimination.''   Also Saturday, a Jordanian newspaper said Israel is limiting to2,500 the number of Palestinians allowed to cross daily from Jordanto the West Bank. The Arabic-language daily Al-Rai said the decisionwill take effect Tuesday.   In previous years, as many as 4,000 Arabs a day were allowed tocross over the Jordan River, according to Col. Abdul-Hafith Uteish,a deputy bridge director quoted by Al-Rai.   The travelers are Palestinians who visit relatives in theoccupied areas.</TEXT></DOC>
