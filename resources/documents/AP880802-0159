The Commerce Department said sales of new single-family homesclimbed to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 734,000 units inJune, the highest sales level since February 1987.   The June increase followed a revised 0.6 percent decline in homesales in May and was the biggest one-month advance since an 11.9percent sale rise in February. The government also revised upwardthe level of sales for March, April and May, showing more strengthin the residential market than previously believed.   Analysts said these developments were encouraging signs, butthey cautioned against too much optimism, primarily because of abelief that mortgage rates are headed still higher.   ``Demand is still there as long as interest rates can stay at areasonable level,'' said Kent Colton, executive vice president ofthe National Association of Realtors. ``But we are concerned thatfor the rest of the year, the pressure on rates will be upward.That means that this is probably the peak as far as sales areconcerned.''   Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage BankersAssociation, said part of the sales push in June came from attemptsby home buyers to close deals before rates went higher.   Peach noted that the Federal Reserve boosted interest ratestwice in May and once in June in highly publicized moves to dampeninflationary pressures.   Fixed-rate mortgages now stand at 10.5 percent on average. JamesChristian, chief economist for the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, predicted they would hit 11 percent by the end of theyear.   But even with the continued rise in rates, Christian predictedthat new-home sales would total 650,000 units this year, down only3 percent from the 1987 pace.   ``The upward revisions in sales back through March indicate thehousing market was doing pretty well through the spring,'' he said.``People have confidence that the economy will remain strong andthey don't have to worry about going out and making a commitment tobuy a home.''   Prices of new homes were up sharply in June, with the medianprice at $117,800, up $7,800 from May. The median price means halfthe homes sold for more and half for less.   The average price of a home was up as well, climbing 5.7 percentto $141,200.   Analysts said much of the price increase reflected thegeographic composition of the sales increase. Sales were up sharplyin the Northeast and West, the two regions with the highest homeprices.   The sales advance was led by a 28.9 percent rise in the West,where sales totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 245,000units. Sales in the Northeast climbed 15.5 percent to 119,000 units.   Sales fell 4.2 percent in the South to an annual rate of 273,000units. Sales were down 1 percent in the Midwest to a rate of 97,000units.   For the first six months of the year, new-home sales were 3.2percent lower than in the same period a year ago.</TEXT></DOC>
