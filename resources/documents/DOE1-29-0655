It then offers asingle scenario of accelerated gas use through the twenty first centuryas a means of high lighting how these conventional wisdoms may have tochange. An important component must be rapid technological progress inthe more efficient utilization of natural gas. Given that the large scalemobilization of finance for gas megaprojects looks doubtful while theavailability of oil at current prices persists, we must look to thoseareas where commercial forces are likely to exert most pressure. Theseare, in the authors view, likely to be first, Western Europe, and second,the sixty or so developing countries with already proven gas reserves.The conclusion is that whereas Western Europe is likely to be able tolook after itself, drawing largely on experience and techniques alreadyevolving in the United States, the developing world will be very dependenton the evolution of standard investment packages and an internationalclimate which can rescue gas development there from the inertia intowhich it is rapidly falling.</TEXT></DOC>
