McLin's mind will be on how to mobilize support for the Democratic ticket this fall. &quot;The progress I've seen in this convention is tremendous,&quot; says the veteran of five conventions.    Janice Thurmond will be thinking about the day when a black stands in Mr. Dukakis's spot. &quot;We'll be running the party 25 years from now,&quot; says the young political activist.    Angelita Ortega will be angry -- turned off by the outcome of this convention. &quot;Even though Jackson is going to tell his people to support the ticket, I'm not going to,&quot; says the community activist.    Mr. McLin, Ms. Thurmond and Ms. Ortega all came to Atlanta as Jesse Jackson delegates, not just pledged but passionately committed to his candidacy. But tonight, watching another man lay claim to the prize, they will diverge politically.    An NBC News poll of convention delegates found that eight Jackson delegates in 10 think the Massachusetts governor hasn't treated Mr. Jackson fairly. There is a range of grievances: that Mr. Jackson was bypassed for the No. 2 spot despite his voter strength; that he wasn't given advance word of the Bentsen selection; that party rules kept Mr. Jackson from getting as many delegates as he was entitled to; and that the party has generally taken blacks for granted.    Two nights ago, in a powerful and moving address, these delegates heard Mr. Jackson call on them to find &quot;common ground&quot; and unite behind the Democratic ticket. But as strong as Mr. Jackson's hold over his delegates has been, it is not control.    &quot;His suggestion is very important to me,&quot; says Johnnie Walls, a Greenville, Miss., lawyer and Jackson delegate. &quot;But I like to think I'm an independent-thinking individual.&quot;    For Mr. Dukakis, the challenge now is to appeal to these independent thinkers. How well he can keep the support of people like Mr. McLin and Ms. Thurmond, and minimize the number of those who think like Ms. Ortega, may be important to his chances for election in November.    Mr. Jackson &quot;has won some things, but the question is how significantly his constituents view those things,&quot; says Ron Walters, a Jackson policy adviser in 1984 and 1988 who defied Mr. Jackson's urging four years ago for his supporters to unite behind Walter Mondale.    Jackson supporters' reactions after the Atlanta convention and their political experiences this year will have implications far beyond the 1988 campaign. They also may determine the course of black political struggles for years to come -- whether those supporters feel they have a voice in the Democratic Party, or whether they look for other avenues to power.    Contrary to the popular, media-conveyed image, Mr. Jackson's supporters are not monolithic. His delegates vary widely in age, political experience and even race: Only two-thirds of them are black. Their responses to the 1988 campaign aren't monolithic either.    Some, including many black elected officials, have witnessed the political and civil-rights struggles of the last 25 years and see progress being made. Almost 23% of the delegates at this convention are black, twice the percentage in 1976 and almost 10 times that of 1964. These veterans believe that the best way to continue this progress is by electing the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket. (Not all feel this way: Few Jackson backers are more outspoken about what they contend is Mr. Jackson's mistreatment by the political process than Illinois Congressman Gus Savage and California Assemblywoman Maxine Waters. But these are exceptions.)    Others also accept Mr. Jackson's defeat and are willing to back the ticket. But these people already are laying plans to be back four years from now -- and four years after that, and four years after that -- until the party realizes their dream of nominating a black for president.    Finally, there are those for whom Mr. Jackson's defeat has been so crushing, who are so critical of his treatment by the party, that they have become embittered. They are, among Jackson supporters, a distinct minority -- but in a close election could prove important in a few pivotal states.    Here, then, is a closer look at three differing Jackson delegates, and the sentiments they represent:   The Veteran   &quot;I'm a strong believer in the philosophy of the Democratic Party,&quot; declares C.J. McLin.    For 25 years the Dayton, Ohio, undertaker has been involved in the civil-rights movement. For most of that time he has been active in Democratic politics, holding a seat in the state legislature and even, 15 years ago, heading up the short-lived presidential campaign of Sen. Lloyd Bentsen in Ohio.    This year, Mr. McLin ran the Jackson campaign in the state. He surveys his man's defeat from the vantage point of a seasoned veteran of the political wars.    Mr. Jackson, Mr. McLin says, has played a critical role by carrying on the traditions others began more than a quarter-century ago. &quot;He's picked up the Martin Luther King gavel,&quot; he says. The role is critically important, he believes. &quot;Power concedes nothing,&quot; he argues, meaning that without strong leaders like Mr. Jackson to voice black needs and concerns, the Democrats would ignore them.    But with the perspective of a longtime politician who has seen many changes, he views this year's Jackson experience in a very positive light: &quot;Somebody who has been through the '60s, they see some visible improvement in the party. We can remember a time when no blacks served in party positions -- or only a token black, because we fought.&quot; Since his first convention in 1968, he says, &quot;The advancement in progressive politics particularly is beyond my expectations.&quot;    So Mr. McLin will enthusiastically be urging his constituents to vote for Michael Dukakis and Lloyd Bentsen this fall. &quot;When Dukakis accepts the nomination,&quot; he says, &quot;I'm going to be very happy that we got the platform that we got, that Jesse Jackson was able to instill into the platform of the Democratic Party issues that pertain to the basic issues of America, and Dukakis was agreeable to accept them and run on them.&quot;    The Pragmatist   &quot;I'm not frustrated,&quot; Janice Thurmond says when asked about the Jackson experience this year, &quot;because I know time is on his side.&quot;    Mr. Jackson tells confidants that one of the real problems in his campaign was the absence of trained young black professionals. After the election, he plans to establish a political training school for aspiring black political practitioners to create a talent pool for future black campaigns -- including, most likely, his own. He will be looking for people like Janice Thurmond, a tough-minded pragmatist.    Ms. Thurmond, 34 years old, is a lawyer in Athens, Ga. She grew up in a political family, but she thinks her generation is different from that of her parents, the one that was in the forefront of the civil-rights struggle and the early black political movement.    The older civil-rights veterans, she feels, &quot;believe in the purity of the ideal.&quot; By contrast, her generation -- &quot;buppies,&quot; the black equivalent of yuppies -- &quot;are not super-idealistic. . . . We grew up with Watergate and Vietnam, and we're pretty cynical.&quot;    Although an active Democrat, she doesn't feel any great loyalty to the party. &quot;Blacks should not be held hostage to the Democratic Party,&quot; she warns, demanding &quot;a party I can believe in.&quot; Yet despite her reservations, Ms. Thurmond expects to be working for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket in Georgia this fall as another step toward the goal of one day nominating and electing a black president.    The Firebrand   &quot;The Democratic party is committed to money,&quot; angrily protests Angelita Ortega, standing outside a lavish delegate party in Atlanta this week. &quot;We're just there to be used.&quot;    Ms. Ortega, a 44-year-old from New York's Harlem who owns rental property, is one of those firebrands -- plainly a minority among Jackson delegates -- who have been embittered by the political experiences of this year. She approvingly cites a colleague's declaration that there is &quot;only one party in America today: That's the white, male, dominate-the-world party.&quot;    Ms. Ortega thinks the white power establishment has shown &quot;disrespect&quot; for Jesse Jackson, who she argues was thwarted by unfair party rules. And she sees the choice of Lloyd Bentsen as aimed only at protecting the party's white-dominated conservative wing.    She believes there will be a black president in her lifetime. But Americans, she says, will never be ready to elect a black president &quot;unless pushed.&quot; And she rejects the argument that a Democratic victory this fall might be a small step along the path toward opening up the process. Instead, she says, it would be &quot;a hip idea&quot; for minorities to vote in large numbers for important local offices -- while ignoring the national ticket.    So strong are her feelings that she says she would be willing to &quot;suffer four more years of Reaganomics&quot; in order to teach the Democrats not to take minorities for granted. </TEXT></DOC>
