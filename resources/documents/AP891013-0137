Bass.   Meanwhile in Washington, a hearing is scheduled Monday beforethe House Public Works and Transportation Committee on legislationproposed this week that would give the government more authority toreview airline buyouts.   In early trading today on the New York Stock Exchange, AMR wasup $3.625 a share to $102.375, still well below the $120 per shareoffered by Trump, but the second straight day of an increase.   On Thursday, AMR rose $1.625 to close at $98.75 as 1.6 millionshares changed hands. On Wednesday, the price had fallen $4.25 ashare.   Financial analysts have said the stock will continue to tradefar below the level of Trump's offer until there is a significantmove by either side.   The New York Times reported today that AMR Chairman Robert L.Crandall met with American's pilots union about a possibleemployee-management buyout designed to fend off Trump's offer. Thebuyout would include significant participation by the pilots unionand the unions representing Machinists and flight attendants atAmerican, the Times said.   Pilots union officials did not return calls seeking comment. Theother two unions previously have said they have discussed possibleresponses to the Trump offer.   The Times, quoting an unidentified Wall Street source, said theAMR buyout would be similar to a pending pilot-management bid forUAL Corp., parent of United Airlines.   Previous reports have said the pilots at American were askedprior to Trump's bid to study a possible buyout.   Meanwhile, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that aidesto Bass had indicated the secretive investor might be willing tohelp AMR fend off Trump. Bass officials refused to comment on thereport.   AMR, parent of the nation's largest and most profitable airline,has remained silent on Trump's offer since it was revealed Oct. 5,saying it will respond ``in due course.'' The next scheduledmeeting of the board of directors is Oct. 18.   Trump officials said Thursday there ``is nothing new toreport.'' On Wednesday, Trump attorney Jack Nusbaum said there hadbeen no contact between the two sides. Trump's offer is set toexpire Oct. 20.   AMR, while refusing to discuss its own proposed takeover, saidThursday it had asked the Department of Transportation ``to makefundamental changes'' in the air service agreement between theUnited States and Britain before allowing British Airways PLC toparticipate in a leveraged buyout of UAL.   Under the proposed $6.75 billion buyout, British Airways wouldend up with 15 percent of Chicago-based UAL, while employees wouldown 75 percent and management 10 percent.   British Airways shareholders voted in London today to approvethe airline's 15 percent stake in UAL, which would cost it $750million.   AMR said the UAL deal ``represents a unilateral opening of U.S.aviation markets.''   AMR spokesman Al Becker said the company believes the U.S.government should require Britain to ease access to its markets forU.S. carriers.   Becker said American has been stymied in its efforts to launchChicago-London and New York-Manchester routes because ``the Britishgovernment is one of the most restrictive in the world'' inallowing foreign carriers access to its markets.</TEXT></DOC>
