A similar camera was introduced by Sony Corp. last year, but theToshiba-Fuji system is aimed to record images as digital signals,enabling easy transmission of pictures using personal computers andtelephone lines.   ``There are hundreds of advantages in the digitalized system,''said Shozo Iijima, Toshiba's chief engineer. ``The system will bringrevolutionary changes in the field of still pictures.''   Digital electronic signals will be stored on a floppy disc insidethe camera. Because it is recorded digitally, pictures can be storedin personal computers, Iijima said.   The camera will be too costly for broad commercialization.   ``The memory portion of the system involving semiconductors istoo expensive with the current cost of microchips,'' Iijima said.``So the main objective of our project is to lower the cost of thememory without reducing the quality of the picture.''   Officials of the two companies predicted the system will beavailable by 1990 for industrial use and by 1991 for commerical use.Toshiba and Fuji Film also said they plan to call on otherelectronic and camera manufacturers to standarize the format of thedigital camera system.</TEXT></DOC>
