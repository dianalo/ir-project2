Lomax, Director, Policyand Planning Division, Office of Real Estate Policy and Sales, FederalProperty Resources Service, General Services Administration (202-535-7052).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The General Services Administration(GSA) has determined that this rule is not a major rule for the purposeof Executive Order 12291 of February 17, 1981, because it is not likelyto result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; amajor increase in costs to consumers or others; or significant adverseeffects. Therefore, a Regulatory Impact Analysis has not been prepared.GSA has based all administrative decisions underlying this rule on adequateinformation concerning the need for, and consequences of, this rule; hasdetermined that the potential benefits to society from this rule outweighthe potential costs and has maximized the net benefits; and has chosenthe alternative approach involving the least net cost to society.This regulation informs Federal agencies that excess real property whichis reported to GSA for disposal must include information on the presenceof certain asbestos-containing materials. In addition, this regulationadvises the public that the disposal agency shall include such informationin its offering documents as part of its disposal process.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments</ITAG>GSA previously published this regulation as a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 17, 1988. In addition, in a letterto the various landholding executive agencies, GSA also indicated thatit would require information on the cost and time necessary to remove anyasbestos-containing materials. As a result of the publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and through other correspondence with the executivelandholding agencies, GSA received a number of comments. The commentersgenerally endorsed the GSA proposal, with some offering additional suggestions/recommendationsas follows:1. One commenter objected to the requirement to provide the disposal agencywith the estimate of the cost and time to remove deteriorated asbestos-containingmaterials on the basis that such information would not be reasonably availableor ascertainable from the agency files. GSA's intent in proposing to requirethe estimates was to obtain as much information as possible to assist thedisposal agency in its internal decisionmaking regarding the propertiesreported to it for disposal. GSA has clarified its intent in obtainingsuch information in this final regulation. 2. One commenter recommended that GSA perform, or contract for, any requiredtechnical asbestos-containing materials studies. GSA does not intend inthe regulation to require any technical asbestos-containing materials studies.GSA only intends that the holding agency provide to the disposal agencythat information that the government already has available with respectto the presence of asbestos-containing materials in the property.3. Two commenters recommended that GSA clarify the extent to which informationis to be made available. GSA does not believe it can adequately describethe extent of the files and records search appropriate for each property.GSA believes that each holding agency is in the best position to know whatfiles may be available and the likelihood that asbestos-containing materialsare present in each building.4. Two commenters recommended that GSA require future owners to includethe information on asbestos-containing materials in subsequent resales.GSA does not believe that this requirement would be practical or enforceable.The only effective means of ensuring continuous notice would be a deedcovenant. GSA did not intend for this regulation to require such a deednotice. GSA's intent is to ensure a consistent approach to disposals ofgovernment real property. Subsequent resales would be subject to Stateand local law at the time of sale.  5. Several commenters recommended that GSA use the term ``asbestos-containingmaterial'' in the regulation. This change has been incorporated into thefinal regulation.6. One commenter expressed concern over the relationship of this regulationand the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed regulation implementingsection 120(h) of the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act Amendmentsof 1986 (SARA) (Pub. L. 99-499). The proposed EPA regulation, which waspublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of January 13, 1988, requires notice to potentialpurchasers of Federal real property on which hazardous substance activitytook place. GSA is aware of this regulation and has worked closely withEPA on both the SARA and this regulation. The SARA regulation concernsthe ``environment'' (i.e. the ambient air, soil, water, etc.). This asbestosregulation concerns buildings where asbestos-containing materials are partof the building. This regulation states in andSection;101-47.200(b) thatthe provisions of the regulation do not apply to asbestos which falls underSARA, i.e., asbestos which is an environmrntal issue will be handled byEPA's SARA regulation. Any asbestos-containing materials which are partof the building will be handled by this GSA regulation. This commenter also recommended that this regulation be revised to discussonly ``friable asbestos''. GSA's intent is to provide a method for thegovernment in its surplus property disposals to handle asbestos in anyform, friable or not. The government will describe the asbestos-containingmaterials based on the reasonably available information. As discussed inandSection;101-47.304-13(f), the purchaser agrees to be responsible for remedialaction to meet appropriate Federal, State, and local regulations for occupancyof buildings.7. One commenter requested clarification of the wording of the warningnotice in andSection;101-47.304-13. We have revised the wording of the warningnotice.8. One commenter questiond the need to disclose the existence of asbestos-containingmaterial in Government real property. This commenter also requested clarificationof the wording of the health risks and requested disclosure of any asbestoscontrol programs instituted by the government. GSA believes that the disclosureof the existence of asbestos-containing materials in a building proposedfor disposal is a prudent requirement and will ensure a consistent approachto sales of government real property. GSA has changed the regulation torequire information on the existence of any asbestos control programs andhas reworded the warning notice.After careful consideration of these comments, GSA continues to believethe publication of the regulation is a prudent action. GSA has modifiedthe content of the final regulation as discussed above.  <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 41 CFR Part 101-47</ITAG>Government property management, Surplus Government property.<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 101-47_UTILIZATION AND DISPOSAL OF REAL PROPERTY</ITAG>Accordingly, 41 CFR Part 101-47 is amended as follows:  1.
