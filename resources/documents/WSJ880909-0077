A third expects nothing less than a civil war, pitting &quot;physician against physician.&quot;    The event that is supposed to trigger this medical mayhem is scheduled for later this month, when researchers at Harvard University publish the results of a three-year study that may radically alter the way doctors are paid.    Known as the RBRVS study -- for Resource-Based Relative Value Scale -- the 1,000-page report, which was commissioned by Congress, will show how Medicare might reimburse physicians based on the amount of work or &quot;resources&quot; they expend on a given task. Currently, Medicare payments are based primarily on what physicians have charged for their services in the past.    With doctors' fees now totaling about $110 billion a year and rising 15% annually, some health officials and insurers see relative-value scales as an equitable way to help contain health-care costs.    The Harvard study &quot;takes into account the resources that the physician brings to the table,&quot; says Dan Dragalin, a doctor and vice president of group medical care at Prudential Insurance Co. of America. &quot;It's the first approach with any degree of objectivity.&quot;    The medical community, however, is deeply divided over just how objective that approach might really be. Traditionally, physicians have been paid more for specific medical procedures than for general medical services. For instance, a doctor who detects a stomach ulcer by spending about 30 minutes inserting a tube in a patient might receive $350; a doctor who arrives at the same diagnosis following a 45-minute physical exam might receive $75.    A relative-value system would reduce those disparities by focusing on the time and effort involved -- and rewarding doctors accordingly. The result: Some doctors would make less money than they do now; some would make more. Last March, the director of the Harvard study, William C. Hsiao, an economist at the university's School of Public Health, reported that the new system could reduce Medicare payments to some specialists -- including surgeons and pathologists -- by as much as 20% to 30% and increase payments to other doctors -- primarily family physicians and internists -- by a similar amount.    Predictably, many doctors in the former group vehemently oppose the Harvard study, while their colleagues in the latter group enthusiastically support it. Taking the middle ground, the American Medical Association says it supports the concept of a relative-value scale, although it hasn't specifically endorsed the work of Prof. Hsiao and his colleagues.    There is no guarantee that the Harvard report will be adopted by Medicare. Both the White House and top federal officials in the Health Care Financing Administration, which administers Medicare, oppose relative-value scales. However, the idea appears to have strong backing in Congress and has been supported by the Physician Payment Review Commission, an independent advisory panel created by Congress in 1985. (The commission and the Department of Health and Human Services are required to submit recommendations to Congress next year on how best to reform physician reimbursement.) And whatever their differences, legislators, doctors and third-party payers agree that the current payment system has become unworkable.    Ever since it was set up in 1966, Medicare has based payments to physicians on the lowest of three things: the bill charged; the physician's customary charge (the median of individual charges for the same type of visit or procedure over the previous year); or the prevailing charge in the doctor's locale.    But critics say that this &quot;customary, prevailing and reasonable&quot; method -- known as CPR -- is difficult to administer and often unfair. &quot;The current system is very complex,&quot; says Prof. Hsiao, &quot;and the payments made to physicians are often unpredictable.&quot; New doctors, for instance, are sometimes paid more than experienced physicians for the same service; this reflects a history of lower charges among older doctors.    Worst of all -- from the viewpoint of Medicare and insurers -- the system is inflationary. By linking payments to what a doctor has charged in the past, CPR gives doctors an incentive to boost their fees.    &quot;It's very easy for a group of physicians in a given city to raise&quot; their prices, says Dr. Dragalin at Prudential. &quot;I'm not saying they do it on purpose or sit down and decide. But if you're a physician charging $250 for a procedure, and a physician a mile away is getting away with charging $500, then you're gradually going to raise your fee to $500.&quot;    The Harvard proposal attempts to solve these problems by tying doctors' Medicare payments to the amount of work they perform on any given task. To measure work, the researchers developed an equation with four variables: time, mental effort, technical skill and stress. (A doctor's length of training and the cost of his practice -- including rent and staff salaries -- are also factored into the equation.)    The Harvard researchers then asked more than 3,000 physicians to judge the relative amount of time, mental effort, skill and stress involved in hundreds of procedures. These values would be multiplied by a conversion factor -- a fixed dollar amount to be set by Medicare -- to determine a doctor's compensation.    Thus, says Prof. Hsiao, if an appendectomy is calculated to be worth 300 units of work, and if Medicare decides one unit is worth $1.50, a surgeon performing such an operation would receive $450.    Proponents say this system could have several advantages. If compensation is reduced for certain procedures -- say, bypass surgery -- surgeons may have less economic incentive to operate when alternative and less-expensive treatments may be equally effective.    Moreover, by improving pay for primary services -- office visits, for example -- an RVS &quot;will encourage physicians to spend more time with patients,&quot; says Robert B. Doherty, a spokesman for the American Society of Internal Medicine. &quot;That's patients' No. 1 complaint: that physicians don't spend enough time with them.&quot;    Despite these advantages, linking doctors' income to the relative value of their work perpetuates some of the failings of the current reimbursement system. The new system doesn't account for differences in competency among physicians, and doctors who provide higher quality care won't get paid for it. Severity of illness isn't part of the RVS equation, either; doctors who have to work harder because their patients are sicker won't receive more money.    Critics also accuse the Harvard study of being biased. For years, they say, Prof. Hsiao has argued that income should be shifted from so-called proceduralists to primary-care physicians -- &quot;and the study just happens to work out that way,&quot; says James Moorefield, chairman of the economics commission of the American College of Radiology, a national association of radiologists. &quot;That leads me to be cynical and suspicious about the process.&quot;    Will such problems and opposition scuttle a resource-based pay scale? Not entirely, say health experts, a number of whom predict that Congress eventually will adopt a modified version of the Harvard study. &quot;They would use it as a starting point,&quot; says Robert J. Becker, a physician and chairman of HealthCare Compare Corp., a cost-management company in Chicago. &quot;It's not a final answer to the problem of physician reimbursement. But there's a desire to see it brought into place.&quot;    ---           How Much Doctors Charge -- and Who Pays   Typical physician charges for selected services and procedures, with approximate times for each task:    Procedure                    Time              Charge    Reading a chest X-ray        one minute        $10-15    Office visit with family    practitioner                 15 minutes        $25    Office visit with internist  15 minutes        $30    Office visit with    psychiatrist                 50 minutes        $100-150    Removing a lipoma*           20 minutes        $300    Administering anesthesia    during surgery               one hour          $400-500    Hernia repair                30 min.-one hour  $750    Caesarean section            30 min.-one hour  $1,500    Hip replacement              three hours       $3,000    *A benign tumor under the skin made of fat tissue    Source: Prudential Insurance Co. of America   Breakdown of the U.S. health dollar: where the money comes from and where it goes, in cents:                          Who Pays           Private health insurance            .31           Direct payment                      .25           Medicare                            .17           Other government                    .14           Medicaid                            .10           Other private                       .03                        Where It Goes           Hospital care                       .39           Physicians' services                .20           Miscellaneous personal health care  .20           Research, administration            .13           Nursing homes                       .08   Source: Health Care Financing Administration</TEXT></DOC>
