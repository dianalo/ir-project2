Jesse Jackson to discuss the possible release of Americansheld hostage in Lebanon by pro-Iranian factions, Iran's U.N.ambassador said Thursday.   Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellarannounced he would meet Friday with the wife of a kidnappedAmerican, Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   Higgins was abducted by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon inFebruary, and U.N. diplomats have reported hearing rumors recentlythat he might be released.   This week's peace talks between the secretary-general and envoysfrom Iran and Iraq have brightened hopes for movement in gainingthe release of Western hostages in Lebanon. Perez de Cuellar saidhe raised the issue Wednesday with Iranian Foreign Minister AliAkbar Velayati.   However, Iranian Ambassador Mohammad Ja'afar Mahallati saidThursday that his country's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati,was focusing on ending the Iran-Iraq war, not on releasinghostages, while in New York.   ``He doesn't have a mandate to embark on anything other thanimplementation of the Security Council Resolution 598'' on acease-fire and peace plan to end the war, Mahallati said in answerto questions.   ``Indeed, not,'' Mahallati said when asked if Velayati wouldmeet Jackson.   Earlier Thursday, Jackson telephoned Perez de Cuellar about thehostages and asked him to convey a message to Velayati, U.N.officials said. They said the secretary-general did so.   But Mahallati said his mission had not yet received acommunication from Perez de Cuellar.   ``I don't think the minister (Velayati) had intended in thisvisit to make any effort in this line, and we don't have anymandate to embark on any such discussion,'' Mahallati said.   Perez de Cuellar told reporters Wednesday night that he hadraised the problem of American hostages ``very, very specifically''with Velayati during a meeting that day.   ``I can confirm that the Rev. Jesse Jackson telephoned thesecretary-general early today about the fate of the Americanhostages and asked that this message be conveyed to the foreignminister of Iran,'' the secretary-general's spokesman, FrancoisGiuliani, said in answer to reporters' questions.   ``This was conveyed by the secretary-general to the foreignminister.''   Giuliani did not elaborate.   Earlier Thursday, the Iranian Mission's counselor, MohammadJavad Zarif, said there had been no approach from the Jackson campand said, ``I do not think that there are any specific issues thatwe'll have to talk about.''   Jackson said Wednesday in Chicago that he had sought a meetingwith Velayati through the secretary-general to discuss obtainingrelease of the American hostages.   Iran has said it could intercede to obtain their freedom if theUnited States agreed to release Iranian assets frozen in the UnitedStates.   The United States has said it is willing to discuss the issuebut has rejected any deal or payment of ransom.   Nine Americans are among 18 foreigners being held hostage bypro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon. Longest held is Terry A.Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.Anderson, 40, was abducted in Moslem west Beirut on March 16, 1985.   The U.N Security Council was expected to adopt a resolutionFriday appealing for the release of Higgins, 43, kidnapped Feb. 17on a highway in Lebanon, U.N. officials said. Higgins was chief ofthe U.N. Troop Supervision Organization, a military observer groupin the Middle East.   Perez de Cuellar told reporters Thursday that he would meetRobin Higgins, Higgins' wife, at U.N. headquarters at her request.</TEXT></DOC>
