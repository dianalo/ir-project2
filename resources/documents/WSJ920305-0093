As investors shift their money from low-interestcertificates of deposit to stocks, bonds and otherinvestments, a staggering $275 million a day is cascadinginto Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the nation's biggest brokeragefirm.</LP><TEXT>   At that record pace -- 25% above last year's -- Merrillwould take in $71.5 billion in investors' funds in the next12 months, though Merrill executives don't think the cashflood can continue for that long. Already, Merrill, a pioneerin gathering client assets, has a record $435 billion ofcustomer money, equal to 15% of the U.S. national debt.   The cash is also flooding in at other Wall Street firms.Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. is getting more than $50million in investors' cash a day, tripling the customer fundsat the Primerica Corp. unit in just three years. Dean WitterReynolds Inc. says its &quot;wrap&quot; accounts, where clients' moneyis parceled out to professional money managers for a fee,grew by $1 billion in all last year, but have alreadyattracted $500 million in just the first two months of thisyear.   There's more to the investor stampede than just CDsticker-shock. The booming rally in the stock market in 1991is &quot;what's really propelling a lot of the money coming toWall Street, even more than the rates on CDs,&quot; says RobertDwyer, head of national sales at Dean Witter, a unit ofSears, Roebuck andamp; Co. Unlike CDs, of course, stock prices cansuddenly fall.   Are brokerage executives doing cartwheels? &quot;I sure am,&quot;says William Sullivan, a top executive in Merrill's11,000-broker network. &quot;It's a very strong reaction to thedecline in rates.&quot;   Indeed, the huge cash flood is testing Merrill to thelimits. Merrill's army of clerks who process new wrapaccounts opened by investors are working 15- to 18-hour daysjust to get all the paper work done. Some new customers arehaving to wait longer than usual just to get their accountsstarted.   Of course, all this cash is a big bonanza for Wall Street,since it will translate into lots of trading commissions andbrokerage fees. But it's also a test. Wall Street is nowhaving to deal with thousands of new investors who aren'tused to the ups and downs of the stock market.   &quot;There's a lot of confusion and fear among the incomegroup that relied on CDs,&quot; says Joseph Grano, who runsPaineWebber Group Inc.'s brokerage operations. &quot;They didn'thave to evaluate anything else for literally the last 15years.&quot;   Brokerage executives are taking special pains to promisethey will be &quot;responsible&quot; with the hoard of investordollars. Brokerage firms readily concede that the securitiesindustry cared too much about generating commissions, ratherthan building customer relationships, in the roaring 1980s.And some customers got hurt by limited partnerships that wentsour and junk bonds that defaulted. That must change, theexecutives say.   If these former CD lovers aren't handled correctly bytheir brokers, Wall Street could turn away a generation ofinvestors who are plunging into the stock market, brokerageexecutives say.   Vows PaineWebber's Mr. Grano: &quot;We're going to do it right.It doesn't mean every stock we pick is going to go up, but itmeans the intent is pure, and you must make sure youunderstand the objectives of the client and the risktolerance. In the '80s, the industry got away from that alittle bit.&quot;   The biggest chunk of the new money coming into brokeragefirms, about 40% at some big firms, is going into stock andbond mutual funds. The funds appeal to many CD-type investorswho feel they aren't knowledgeable enough to pick their ownstocks and bonds.   But brokerage firms stress that much of the new money hasbeen going directly to buy individual stocks: about 33% ofthe new cash at Merrill, for example. Another 15% of the newmoney at Merrill flows into bonds. A puny 10% is going intoMerrill's own money market funds, the safest and leastattractive place for investors to be with interest rates solow.   Brokerage executives say that only a small percentage ofthe new money is going into such relatively arcane productsas collateralized mortgage obligations. They say it'salready-active investors who are buying these potentiallyriskier products.   Meanwhile, brokerage firms are reaching out to snare evenmore investor dollars in coming months, partly throughadvertising campaigns to entice investors away from theirlow-yielding CDs.   Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., the nation's second biggestbrokerage firm and a unit of American Express Co., ran aseries of CD-bashing radio ads in February and got asurprising 10,000 responses from investors. Merrill recentlylaunched a new ad campaign touting its mutual funds and mayresurrect its &quot;Don't Get Caught Short&quot; marketing campaignaimed at CD holders. And Smith Barney is planning to beef upits profile with potential investors by re-employing itsfamous slogan: &quot;They make money the old-fashioned way. Theyearn it.&quot;   If brokerage firms continue to attract millions ofinvestor dollars a day, they may be able to duplicate theirrecord profits of 1991, some analysts now say. The stocks ofpublicly traded brokerage firms such as Merrill andPaineWebber have already doubled and tripled in the past yearor so, thanks to the big boom in new stock and bond offeringsand healthy trading profits. &quot;Firms that really focus onasset gathering are going to see increases in profits,&quot; saysAlison Deans, a brokerageindustry analyst at Smith Barney.&quot;The earnings leverage on the retail {individual investor}side isn't over. We've just begun to see it.&quot;   ---                      Torrent of Cash                                                                                                          Estimated customer assets under control at some big WallStreet brokerage firms, in billions                                                                                                                                  ASSETS        CHG.
