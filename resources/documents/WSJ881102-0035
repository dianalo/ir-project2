For the past six months, savings bonds carried an interest rate of 6.9%. The interest rate on savings bonds is adjusted on May 1 and Nov. 1 of every year to reflect changes in market interest rates.    The new rate is 85% of the average market interest rate on five-year Treasury bonds between May 1 and Oct. 31.    Bonds must be held at least five years to earn market-based rates.    Holders of savings bonds are guaranteed a minimum rate no matter what happens in financial markets. The minimum is currently 6%. For bonds purchased before Nov. 1, 1986, the minimum is 7.5%. </TEXT></DOC>
