As the volume ratio of breeding materialin the core, the value 0.3 is adopted to minimize the doubling time.It is revealed that the core with fuel element heterogeneity is higherby about 5 percent in the critical charge of fissile isotopes with thedensity of neutron flux decreased by 30 percent, that the uniformityof output density is higher for the heterogeneous core, that the breedingratio and excess plutonium production can be increased by 14.5 percentand 68 percent, respectively, with a decrease in doubling time by 32percent, and that the sodium void factor of reactivity is decreased by10 percent with the reactivity Doppler factor being doubly inferior.In the core with fuel element homogeneity, the temperature of fuel andbreeding material do not exceed 2,520deg C and 760deg C, respectively.Fuel assemblies provided with axial blanket layers are irradiated ina BOR-60 reactor up to 8 - 11 percent. Satisfactory sealing in foundto be maintained in all fuel elements examined. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
