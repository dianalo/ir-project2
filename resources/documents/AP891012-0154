Police said they arrested 121 U.S. and British sailors after anestimated 500 seamen and scores of police brawled Wednesday nightalong Lisbon's seedy, bar-dotted dockside.   The sailors were released to their ships Thursday morning and aBritish aircraft carrier cut short a courtesy call and left forhome because of the fighting.   U.S. Embassy officials insisted that most if not all injurieswere caused by police. Portuguese police said sailors fought amongthemselves, then turned on officers trying to break up the melees.   In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said 142 U.S.sailors were treated for injuries. He said 40 sailors had to behospitalized for injuries such as damaged spleens or possibleconcussions.   Williams said the brawl was being investigated but that therewere several versions of what he called ``a very confusedsituation.''   Portuguese police said four police officers and three civilianswere among the injured.   Paulino Cardoso, duty officer at Lisbon's security police, saidthe melee broke out after three black American seamen attacked awhite U.S. sailor at the Passport Bar in the gaudy, neon-lightedCais do Sodre area. That account could not be confirmed.   A Pentagon official who asked not to be identified said theinjured included officers, a chaplain and intelligence officers whowere trying to calm a confrontation that arose when police tried toclear an area of sailors following some type of disturbance.   The official said there were reports that indicated police wereresponsible for ``severe indiscriminate beatings.''   U.S. Embassy information officer Arthur Liefkowitz said: ``Allthe 142 injuries treated seem to have resulted from clashes withthe police.''   A Lisbon public security police force spokesman, Lt. PereiraChumbinho, did not deny force was used. But he said sailors``maltreated'' the first two police crews to arrive on the scene,then surrounded a third vehicle.   ``Then we had to send in three more cars and more forces, but itis sure that the sailors were fighting among themselves and thenturned on the police,'' he said.   Fighting spread from bar to nightclub along the narrow, cobbledstreets of the riverside area about 9 p.m., Cardoso said.   He said British seamen from the aircraft carrier Ark Royal,which arrived in Lisbon on Wednesday on a five-day goodwill visit,joined in the brawling.   Ark Royal Commander Christopher Thomas said only a few Britishsailors had been ``caught up'' in the fighting.   ``There is no evidence of fighting between American and Britishsailors ... and I am confident my men were not involved in anydrunkenness, damage or trouble of any kind,'' Ark Royal Capt. JohnBrigstocke later told reporters.   Cardoso said British sailors had been arrested with theAmericans.   Shore leave was canceled from the Ark Royal and aboard the U.S.assault craft Nassau, Barnstable County and Shreveport.   The U.S. ships were in Lisbon during a break from NATO exercisesoff the Portuguese coast and slated to leave Oct. 20.   Brigstocke said the Ark Royal was cutting short its courtesycall to Lisbon and departed today for Portsmouth, England.   ``It was very confused _ there were police cars driving one way,and sailors running the other, but we had no trouble,'' said anemployee at the nearby Hatari Bar, who asked not to be identified.   ``It was just like Hill Street Blues,'' said a shopkeeper.   Cars were turned over, windows were smashed and about 40 sailorswere arrested when they stormed the local police station, Portugesepolice said.</TEXT></DOC>
