Now the 2-million-member National Education Association mustchoose a successor to Mary Hatwood Futrell, the voice of theteachers union for six years and, some say, the best spokesman itever had.   ``The NEA should light a candle to Mary. The organization owesher a great deal,'' says Ernest Boyer, president of thePrinceton-based Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.   Futrell is credited with shifting the NEA's focus fromself-protection to a more professional concern for better education.Under her leadership, union delegates approved a Carnegie plan for anational board to set standards and certify teachers.   The union started spending its own money on curriculuminnovations and a foundation for education improvement that makesgrants for dropout and illiteracy prevention programs. It alsocooperated with administrators and principals on a joint guide toteacher evaluation.   NEA is still a union, committed to collective bargaining andopposed in principle to merit pay plans supported by many outsidethe teaching field. But its recent activities have gone a long waytoward eroding the obstructionist image that made it such an easytarget in the early 1980s.   Some conservative educators believe Futrell has made onlymarginal progress. ``Her organization under her leadership has movedfrom the Middle Ages to the mid-18th century, and that's quite a lotto accomplish in six years. On the other hand, that still leavesthem in the mid-18th century,'' says Chester Finn, who was anassistant education secretary in the Reagan administration.   Futrell, while admitting she would have liked to move faster onsome issues such as child care and school restructuring, defends theNEA's pace. ``We would be the first to admit that our efforts arejust the beginning,'' she said. ``What's important is that we'retaking the steps. We've said we know we must change and let's try itincrementally at first.''   Nevertheless, when she presides over her final convention nextweekend, Futrell says she will tell the 8,000-odd delegates that``you have to do more. You have to be bold and you have to take morerisks. What we've done is good, but it's not enough.''   The far-flung union has had a reputation, not entirelyundeserved, for cumbersome bureaucracy and resistance to change.Former President Reagan and former Education Secretary WilliamBennett hammered at those flaws in repeated attacks on NEA, using itas a symbol of all that was wrong with American education.   Bennett denounced the NEA as intransigent and said its repeatedcalls for more education spending revealed ``a cash-registermentality.''   Futrell gave as good as she got, pointing out that demands forhigher Pentagon spending never inspired that type of rhetoric fromthe Reagan administration. But out in the field, she found teachersin despair.   ``The depression was so heavy,'' she recalled in an interview.``You'd go in and it was like you were there as a missionary to tryto boost the morale of the school, month after month after month.''   The years under administration fire turned out to have somepositive effects. There was a backlash of sympathy for teachers anda new unity within the NEA. There was also a key decision by Futrellabout three years ago to take the offense, to move ahead with an NEAagenda rather than keep responding to attacks.   Futrell says now that had she known what her first three yearswould be like, she would not have wanted the job. But, relying onthe survival skills she learned as a child, she proved a match forboth Reagan and Bennett. ``When you live with adversity ... youforce yourself to stand up,'' she said. ``You force yourself topersevere. You force yourself to see positive things.''   Futrell was raised in Lynchburg, Va., by a mother who had dreamedof becoming a nurse but was forced by the deaths of her parents andlater her husband to work as a maid and short-order cook. Futrellwas not yet 5 when her father died.   Her mother supported two daughters and two foster daughters on$15 a week, sometimes working 18 hours a day, but always found timeto attend PTA meetings. She brought home books her employers haddiscarded, held weekly spelling bees at home and punished Mary whenher grades were not satisfactory.   As a little girl, Futrell wrote in an autobiographical essay, herclothes sometimes had more holes than fabric and she once had to goto school without shoes. At 8 she started helping her mother dustchurch pews and office desks. By 12 she worked full-time during thesummer. When she graduated from her segregated high school, herteachers raised scholarship money through local churches to enableher to go to college. She honored them by becoming a teacherherself, a business teacher in Alexandria, Va.   Moving from state chapter president to nationalsecretary-treasurer to NEA president, Futrell emerged as acharismatic leader so respected by her members that a room will beset aside for tributes to her at the NEA convention next weekend.   Her achievements win praise even from Albert Shanker, hercounterpart at the rival American Federation of Teachers. He tookher to lunch this month for the first time in six years, ``to tellher what a great job I think she's done,'' according to Shanker.``The people before her were not willing to take the risks or do thehard work. When she did, she got results.''   Futrell says she'll stay active in international education whenshe steps down from her NEA post this summer. She also wants tospend more time with her family and may pursue a graduate degree.   The men vying for her title are Keith Geiger, currently vicepresident of the NEA, and John Wilson, a member of the executivecommittee. The outcome is expected to hinge on last-minutecampaigning at the convention.   There are those who think it is impossible for NEA to be at oncean aggressive union and a respected professional association. ButFutrell says she has spent six years balancing those roles,``forging a marriage that will last for a very long time withoutsacrificing the integrity of either.''   Chances are excellent that whether Geiger or Wilson is elected,her legacy will endure. It's all been part of her plan, one of thereasons she moved more slowly than she would have liked, taking thetime to educate and persuade and convert her members to each newidea.   ``I wanted to make sure that when I walk away on Aug. 31, thatchange is in place, that the changes we've made will have roots,''says Futrell. ``If you agitate people and encourage them to be partof it, then they have ownership. And they will implement thosechanges when you're long gone.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, June 25</NOTE></DOC>
