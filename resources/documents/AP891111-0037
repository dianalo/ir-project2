He told a news conference that although the PLO says it haschanged, it ``is a terrorist organization that practices terror.''   PLO chief Yasser Arafat said last year that he renouncedterrorism and recognized Israel's right to exist. Israel maintains,however, that the PLO is a terror group and refuses to deal with it.   In another development, Arens told reporters that Israel andJapan have agreed to set up a council that will act as a forum fordialogue on bilateral and international issues.   In meetings Thursday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, ForeignMinister Taro Nakayama and other government leaders urged Arens wasurged to open a dialogue with the PLO.   Arens said his government would negotiate with Palestinianselected from the occupied territories under an Israeli peace plan.Those elected are to hold talks with Israel on limited autonomy,with the final status of the territories to be decided later.   Japan supports the concept of an independent Palestinian stateand the withdrawal of Israeli troops from all territories occupiedin the 1967 Middle East war. Israel opposes these points.   Arens is in Japan for a five-day visit. He is only the secondIsraeli foreign minister to visit; Yitzhak Shamir, now primeminister, came in 1985.</TEXT></DOC>
