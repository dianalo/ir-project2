But the cease-fire that began Saturday will test the ability ofthe rebels, led by Massoud Rajavi, to maintain a challenge to thefundamentalist Islamic government in Tehran that began withhit-and-run guerrilla raids and escalated to full-scale militaryoffensives.   Yet even as Tehran appears to be taking the National LiberationArmy more seriously than it has for years, the rebels admit theU.N.-sponsored cease-fire poses problems for continuing theirprivate war against the Islamic republic.   Iraq is unlikely to allow the rebels, composed mainly offighters from the Mujahedeen Khalq, or People's Holy Warriors, tocontinue launching attacks across the border into Iran and riskbeing blamed for violating the truce.   Iranian and Iraqi negotiators are expected to seek assurancesthat both sides will curb opposition groups from operating fromtheir territory. The negotiators are scheduled to meet in GenevaThursday to discuss a formal peace agreement to end the 8-year-oldwar.   Jafarzadeh, interviewed by telephone at rebel headquarters inBaghdad, conceded the cease-fire will halt their attacks into Iran.But he said the rebels will ``find alternatives to continue thestruggle'' against Khomeini.   Asked what these were, he said, without elaboration: ``We havesuitable tactics to implement our strategy. We believe we can copewith this new situation.   ``We've always called for peace. Peace operates to our benefitbecause it will hasten the downfall of Khomeini's government.''   The rebels argue that the Tehran government, after recentmilitary setbacks and the unexpected unconditional acceptance lastmonth of the U.N. cease-fire resolution, is the most vulnerable ithas been since the 1979 revolution.   Last month, the rebels launched the most ambitious attack intheir 18-month-old campaign, capturing the towns of Karand andEslamabad 65 miles inside Iran.   President Ali Khamenei condemned the rebels as: ``A group ofhypocrites, two-faced and evil people, may appear in the countrysupported by foreign propaganda ... to try to break our nationalpride ... and make trouble.''   Tehran claimed its forces killed 4,800 rebels in a three-daybattle and drove them back across the border.   The rebel group said it lost 1,000 fighters but claimed to havekilled or wounded 40,000 of Khomeini's Revolutionary Guards.   It is not possible to verify either side's claim. But diplomatsin Tehran and Baghdad are skeptical of the rebel claims and therehave even been suggestions Baghdad deliberately allowed the groupto be mauled to rid itself of what could become an embarrassment inany peace deal.   Iran's official media, monitored in Nicosia, has reported scoresof Mujahedeen prisoners and collaborators in western Iran have beenexecuted since late July.   The rebels claim the Iranians have executed thousands ofcaptured fighters and political prisoners to stifle resistance.   The Financial Times of London reported from Tehran last weekthat scores of prisoners have been executed in detention centers inthe capital and buried in mass graves.   The rebels believe, nevertheless, that their position will bestrengthened as many Iranians question why their governmentaccepted a cease-fire with Iraq now than a year ago, when Iran heldthe military advantage.   Diplomats in Tehran told The Associated Press there does notappear to be any imminent internal threat to Khomeini's government.   One reason, they said, was that many Iranians who may have beensympathetic to the rebels were appalled by Rajavi's alliance withIraq.   The Mujahedeen were allies of Khomeini against Shah MohammadReza Pahlavi during the revolution. But the fundamentalists turnedon the Mujahedeen, and other leftist factions, in a purge in whichthousands were killed or imprisoned.</TEXT></DOC>
