Garcia</HL><DD> 04/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   A last-minute buying spree in blue-chip stocks helped both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index post modest gains yesterday, as investors chose to focus on the firming dollar rather than a spreading bank prime rate increase.    The industrial average finished 11.36 points higher at 2316.05. It had tumbled nearly 30 points in the first few minutes of trading, as most investors got their first chance to react to Tuesday's late news that two major banks had raised their prime lending rate to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%. Several more banks matched the move yesterday.    But the sell-off was as brief as it was sharp, and stock prices struggled to recover during the morning as investors sought bargain-priced issues. A milder afternoon sinking spell ended suddenly when a few buy programs, mostly linked to stock-index futures, stirred demand in the final 30 minutes of trading. One trader said some of his accounts that had been &quot;just nibbling away&quot; at stocks &quot;got aggressive right before the close.&quot;    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.69 to 292.39, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index moved up 0.15 to 166.04.    Although the late buying put the major market indexes in the plus column, losers on the Big Board outpaced gainers by a nearly 2-to-1 margin. At one point early in the session, decliners held an overwhelming 11-to-1 edge over advancers.    Trading was moderately active, with 182.6 million shares changing hands, compared with 171.8 million Tuesday.    The late rally passed right by the secondary stocks. The American Stock Exchange's Market Value index closed down 1.01 at 331.65. In the over-the-counter market, the Nasdaq OTC composite fell 1.71 to 428.34.    Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg, Thalmann andamp; Co., said the prime rate increase generated conflicting signals in the market. While it helped shore up the dollar, he said, it also raised investor fears of higher rates and inflation. Many investors yesterday apparently chose to focus on the positive side, the firmer dollar, he said.    Bank economists were quick to point out the silver lining in the prime rate cloud. Gary Ciminero, chief economist at Fleet Financial Group in Providence, R.I., said he believes the increase mostly reflected a rise in banks' cost of funds since last August. He said rates might move higher if the economy gains strength, reflecting credit demand and somewhat higher inflation. He also said slightly higher inflation would give some companies pricing flexibility and enhance their earnings outlook.    However, others focused on the cloud. Andrew Kern, an executive vice president of Avatar Associates, said stock market investors tend to take a negative view of the market for as much as six months after a prime rate increase. Higher rates also boost the argument that stocks are overvalued at current prices, he said, because analysts tend to weigh the attractiveness of a company's earnings prospects against prevailing interest rates.    Concern about higher rates led to early drops in interest-sensitive issues, such as bank, thrift, insurance and utility stocks. But the late rally helped pare losses in the group.    Among banks and thrifts, J.P. Morgan fell 3/8 to 42 3/4; Citicorp rose 1/4 to 50 3/4; Chase Manhattan eased 1/8 to 38 1/4; BankAmerica lost 3/8 to 11 5/8; and Bankers Trust eased 3/8 to 45 3/8. Great Western Financial fell 1 to 49 1/4; H.F. Ahmanson dropped 1 1/8 to 23 1/8; Calfed declined 1 1/4 to 33 7/8; and Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan lost 1 1/4 to 31 3/4.    After the close, J.P. Morgan and BankAmerica announced that they were putting their loans to Brazil on a non-accrual basis, meaning they will record interest income from the loans only when payments are received. Net income for both banks would be considerably reduced.    Student Loan Marketing Association fell 1 1/4 to 73 5/8, and Federal National Mortgage Association declined 2 3/8 to 43 1/2 in active trading.    The Dow Jones Utility Average fell 2.30 to 210.39.    Pacific Gas andamp; Electric slid 1 3/4 to 22 3/8 on more than 3.8 million shares. The utility said a change in the method of accounting for its Diablo Canyon nuclear plant will reduce 1987 net income by about $470 million, or $1.25 a share.    Texas Instruments rose 5 to 190 1/2. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that computer chip prices are rising because of fears of a cut in supplies from Japan. Other semiconductor stocks, including Motorola, Advanced Micro Devices, National Semiconductor, Intel and Micron Technology, also rose.    Polaroid rose 2 1/2 to 75 7/8 amid rumors that the company might be moving closer to a &quot;filmless&quot; camera and that takeover specialist Asher Edelman may have accumulated a large position. Mr. Edelman declined to comment.    Orion Capital sank 2 3/4 to 24 1/2. The company reported a loss of $55.4 million for its fourth quarter late Tuesday, widened from a $23.8 million loss a year earlier.    Purolator jumped 5 1/2 to 40 3/8. Emery Air Freight began a $40-a-share tender offer for 83% of Purolator's common. Emery rose 7/8 to 13 1/2.    Other air-freight issues moved higher in sympathy with the Purolator bid. Federal Express gained 2 1/2 to 64 1/4, and Airborne Freight added 3/8 to 33 5/8.    British Petroleum began a previously announced $70-a-share offer for all the Standard Oil shares it doesn't already own. Standard moved up 5/8 to 70 7/8 in heavy volume.    Atlantic Richfield moved up 5 to 85. Dow Jones News Service said several analysts raised their 1987 and 1988 earnings estimates for Arco after its upbeat meeting with analysts Tuesday. Other oil stocks were mostly higher, with Exxon up 2 3/4 to 88 1/2, Du Pont up 1 5/8 to 113 1/2, Amoco up 2 to 81 3/4 and Chevron up 1 3/4 to 57 7/8.    Conrac moved up 5/8 to 29 1/2. The company rejected a takeover offer of $25 a share from a unit of Mark IV Industries. Conrac said it plans to consider alternatives, including a restructuring or a leveraged buyout. Mark IV rose 1/2 to 17 7/8 on the American Stock Exchange.    Revlon Group added 3/8 to 19 1/4 in active trading. A unit of MacAndrews andamp; Forbes began an $18-a-share offer for all the Revlon shares it doesn't already own. </TEXT></DOC>
