And instead of dissolving into amelting pot, they formed a lumpy stew of Old World languages, foodsand customs.   Such are the lessons of the Ellis Island Immigration Museum,which opens to the public Monday on the island through which 12million immigrants passed between 1892 and 1954.   The new museum, housed in the renovated Victorian immigrationstation building, is dedicated to refuting and rewriting a varietyof persistent myths about immigration in general and the island inparticular.   Visitors might be surprised to learn:   _ The only people who were given new names on Ellis Island werethe young women who got married there.   _ A greater proportion of would-be immigrants were barred fromAmerica at European ports, about 5 percent, than at Ellis, 2percent.   _ Most who passed through Ellis ferried on to New Jersey, thegateway to the rest of America, not New York City.   _ Although 30 million people came to America in this century, 10million moved out.   The myth the museum most thoroughly deconstructs is that of theuprooted immigrant, a pathetic, ragged creature blindly fleeingtyranny, plague or famine.   ``These were not destitute people,'' said Diana Pardue,supervisor of curators. ``The really poor did not come over. Theycouldn't afford the passage, or they didn't have the $25 you neededto clear immigration here.''   Most of those who did come, she added, ``were middle- orlower-middle class. They were looking for a better lifestyle, or achance to be educated, or to buy land.''   They had tasted freedom and prosperity in Europe, wanted more,and so set out for the world's emerging agricultural and industrialpower.   ``I don't think the myth of misery and degradation helps atall,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan has written. ``In particular,it doesn't help explain the strengthening of American democracy inthe age of immigration.''   The museum helps refurbish the immigrants' image by displayingtheir middle-class trappings: a teddy bear carried by a girl fromSwitzerland, an early German box camera, a silver pocket watch fromFrance.   Oral histories fill in the picture. The mother of MichaelDukakis, for instance, recalls coming here not because of hunger orwar but because women in her native Greece could not go to college.   If the immigrants were not so wretched, neither were theconditions under which most of them traveled. Pardue admits thatsteerage, the least expensive steamship passenger class, could beunpleasant. But she likens it to ``tourist class on an airlinetoday. (Immigrants) paid a rate like the super-saver fare.''   The museum also stresses the immigrants' attempts to retain,rather than reject, their ethnic identity.   ``The old theory is the melting pot, where immigrants wereimmediately assimilated,'' said Pardue. ``Now we believe that theimmigrants pretty much maintained their ethnicity and settled ingroups of their own.''   Although Ellis welcomed its share of the famous _ Irving Berlinand Bob Hope passed through in their early years _ the new museumemphasizes the experience of ordinary people.   Unlike the immigration museum in the base of the Statue ofLiberty, which stresses the contributions of rich men like AndrewCarnegie and Joseph Pulitzer, ``there are no famous immigrants inthis museum,'' said Phyllis Montgomery, a staffer at a firm thathelped create the exhibits.   The museum also will dispel one particularly durable legend:that Ellis immigration clerks shortened and otherwise``Americanized'' unwieldy European names.   National Park Service researchers encountered only one immigrantwho claimed to have been renamed at Ellis, and she could provide nodocumentation.   What's more, ``there was no legal way names could have beenchanged here,'' said Pardue. ``Even if a clerk mispronouncedsomeone's name, it was never written down.''   Some immigrants' names were changed involuntarily, but probablyby other culprits. Suspects include steamship company clerks inEurope, who compiled the passenger lists on which Ellis immigrationofficials relied.   ``To a clerk in (the German port of) Bremen, some Polish namesmight be incomprehensible,'' said Gary Roth, an exhibit designer.   Some changed their names by taking marriage vows. Theimmigration service would not allow unescorted single young women,including mail-order brides, to leave the island, so the knot wastied in the island's chapel.   In many cases, historians believe, newcomers simply changedtheir own names to better fit in with their new surroundings.   Finally, the museum aims to give Ellis Island itself a newimage. According to Pardue, the ``Isle of Tears'' wasn't so sad:``Most people think it was a drab, awful place, but it wasn't alldoom and gloom.''   The island was breezy in summer, and commanded a fine view oflower Manhattan and New York Harbor. It had playgrounds forchildren, who years later still recalled the man with the cart whohanded out milk and cookies.   The few immigrants who were detained enjoyed three meals a day,gardens, tennis courts and concerts (one said she heard Caruso singthere). Some got their first look at an electric light, otherstheir first taste of white bread.   ``Many people were in awe of the place,'' said Pardue. ``In someways, it was a sort of mini-resort.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Sept. 9</NOTE></DOC>
