Background Information </ITAG>Section 4(h)(11)(A) of the Northwest Power Act provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Administrator and other Federal agencies responsible for managing,operating, or regulating Federal or non-Federal hydroelectric facilitieslocated on the Columbia River and its tributaries shall * * * (ii) exercisesuch responsibilities, taking into account at each relevant stage of decisionmakingprocesses to the fullest extent practicable, the program adopted by theCouncil under this subsection. If, and to the extent that, such other Federalagencies as a result of such consideration impose upon any non-Federalelectric power project measures to protect, mitigate, and enhance fishand wildlife which are not attributable to the development and operationof such project, then the resulting monetary costs and power losses (ifany) shall be borne by the Administrator in accordance with this subsection.</ITAG>The Northwest Power Act does not establish specific procedures or standardsto guide BPA in compensating non-Federal project operators for costs orpower losses resulting from actions imposed by Federal agencies pursuantto the Northwest Power Act. Based on inquiries from several Public UtilityDistricts, in May 1983 BPA published a notice of our intent to enter intorulemaking to develop policies and procedures to compensate non-Federalproject operators. We sought comments from interested parties. In 1985, based on our extensive review of the comments, we determined thedevelopment of a compensation policy would be premature. Since passageof the Northwest Power Act in 1980, and adoption of the Program by theCouncil in 1982, BPA had not received any claims. Given these circumstancesBPA concluded that we could not anticipate the issues that would be raisedby claims. Nor could we anticipate the procedures necessary to review andaddress claims. BPA did not receive any compensation claims until July 1987. At that timeBPA received three claims, all based upon Federal water releases in Mayand June of 1987. These claims were filed by the Public Utility DistrictNo. 1 of Douglas County (Douglas PUD) on July 29, 1987; the Public UtilityDistrict No. 1 of Chelan County (Chelan PUD) on October 5, 1987; and thePublic Utility District of Grant County (Grant PUD) on November 25, 1987.In our June 1988<T4> Federal Register</T4> Notice, we indicated that we would implementa compensation policy before processing these claims. However, we havechosen to address the claims independent of this Policy. Preceding thisPolicy, the actions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps), the Council,and the claimants in 1987 reflect a unique circumstance requiring separateconsideration. Had this Policy been in place, and considered by the Council,Corps, and claimants, we believe the actions which led to the three 1987claims may not have been taken or may have been different. Consequently,the terms and conditions set forth in this Policy may not be fairly applicableto those claims. However, any decisions we made concerning those claimswill not form a precedent for future compensation decisions concluded underthe Policy.BPA reached negotiated settlements with the three Mid-Columbia PUDs duringlate January and early February 1989. All settlements were for lesser amountsof energy or money than originally claimed. Settlement discussions centeredon two issues: (1) The value of the energy spilled, and (2) a comparisonof the operations the PUDs actually undertook against the hypotheticaloperations that could have been taken under the Corps' Coordinated Planof Operation which would have minimized the PUDs' losses.Douglas County PUD had claimed a loss of 2,087 megawatt hours and agreedto a settlement whereby BPA would deliver 1,315 megawatt hours of energyto Douglas during the 1989 Water Budget period when a Water Budget requestwould be in effect. Chelan PUD's claim was for 13,058 megawatt hours. Assumingan average price of 15 mills per kilowatthour, the value of the claim wouldbe $195,870. BPA and Chelan settled for a $163,134 payment from BPA toChelan. Grant PUD's claim was for $591,279 and was settled with BPA paying$451,495. Any decisions BPA made concerning the 1987 claims will not forma precedent for future compensation decisions made pursuant to this Policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Issues</ITAG>The Administrator's decision document on the Compensation Policy will besent to all commenters. It addresses the following general issues whichwere raised in our June 1988<T4> Federal Register</T4> Notice and in the comments we received. Theseissues include:andbullet; The procedures BPA will follow when we receive claims;andbullet; Defining the Federal actions and Program measures that may becompensable and how BPA will determine if a Program measure addresses fishand wildlife effects that are attributable to non-Federal projects; andandbullet; How BPA will compensate claimants.Based upon the comments received and further examination of the issues,we have made several substantive changes in the Policy:1. The Policy is effective from 31 days after the date of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and will not be applied to claims received beforethe effective date of the Policy.2. Any Federal agency proposing to implement a Program measure which mayresult in a claim should consult with interested parties and coordinateactions with BPA in advance, as provided in section 4(h)(11)(B) of theNorthwest Power Act.3. To be ``imposed,'' a measure must be undertaken by a claimant pursuantto an order issued by a Federal agency by force of regulation or law. Waterreleases from upstream projects will not qualify for compensation unlessthe claimant is required by an order to store or release water under authorityof law.4. At the request of interested parties and for good cause shown, BPA mayextend the period for comment or consult further respecting any claim.5. BPA may undertake a fact-finding process to address a claim, and mayemploy a hearings officer.6. After BPA has made a decision concerning a claim, the Policy providesfor a 31-day no-action period, rather than a comment period.BPA received no comments on the Paperwork Reduction Act aspects of theproposed Policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Final Policy</ITAG>Section 1. Effective DateThis policy shall be effective 31 days from the date of its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Section 2.

Conditions Governing Compensation PaymentA. The Administrator will, as a general rule, consider compensation claimsonly from licensees of non-Federal hydroelectric power projects locatedwithin the Columbia River Basin. If a utility which is not a licensee canshow that it has rights in a project which could not be represented bythe project's licensee, such utility may petition the Administrator tofile and request itself in a claim, provided the utilty meets the otherrequirements of BPA's policy and procedures. The Administrator may exercisediscretion to grant or deny the petition.B. When any Federal agency proposes to implement a measure which may giverise to a claim, it should consult and coordinate its actions in advance,pursuant to section 4(h)(11)(B) of Pub. L. 96-501. When any licensee ofa non-Federal project becomes aware that a Federal agency may take or hastaken an action which may form the basis of a claim, it should promptlynotify that agency and the Administrator.C. In order to establish entitlement to compensation, claimants must demonstrateto the Administrator that claimed costs and power losses are the directresult of Measures imposed by a Federal agency to mitigate fish and wildlifeeffects which are not attributable to the development and operation ofthe non-Federal project which is the subject of a claim.D. The Administrator may use other authorities to agree in advance withnon-Federal project owners or operators to provide consideration for operationalmodifications to benefit fish and wildlife.Section 4. Requirements for ClaimantsA. Claimants for compensation must submit a written claim to BPA within120 days after the date a monetary cost or power loss occurs.B. Claimants must demonstrate:1. That claimed monetary costs or power losses have been involuntarilyincurred;2.

Fact-finding Process. BPA may implement a fact-finding process if theAdministrator determines a claim involves controversial or complex issuesincluding, but not limited to, attributing adverse operational impactson fish and wildlife to various projects; determining the availabilityof mitigation opportunities; and the extent of losses suffered by claimants.The Administrator may appoint a hearings officer to conduct a formal fact-findingprocess, make findings based on substantial evidence on the record, andrecommend such findings to the Administrator. The parties to this processshall be limited to the claimant and BPA. The Administrator shall reviewand consider the factual findings of the hearings officer.D. Decisions on Compensation Claims.
