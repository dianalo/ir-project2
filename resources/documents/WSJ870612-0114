Instead of using expensive robots to place the instrument panels in the cars as first envisioned, for example, workers will guide them in by hand, using balance-weighted cranes.    This and other steps back from the future reflect Detroit's reassessment of a high-tech tomorrow, a reassessment prompted by a series of embarrassing and costly glitches.    Auto makers aren't backing away from high tech. But they no longer view it as a magic formula that boosts productivity in, say, direct proportion to the number of robots on the factory floor.    Industry executives increasingly realize that the latest gimcrack won't substitute for improved fundamentals -- namely, better management of work processes and of workers themselves. &quot;Normally if you automate a bad process,&quot; says Ford Motor Co. Vice President Frederick Z. Herr, &quot;you simply get a faster bad process.&quot;    This new attitude emerged strikingly in a biennial poll of auto executives taken by Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. last December. In the five previous polls, &quot;automation got all the votes as the key to improving competitiveness,&quot; says Peter C. Van Hull, the Andersen consultant who conducts the poll. &quot;But this year it got only 8%. That's good for 12th place.&quot; First place went to management practices.    &quot;New equipment doesn't guarantee a good quality car,&quot; says Yoichi Nakane, a Mitsubishi Motors Corp. executive who heads his company's joint venture with Chrysler Corp. When Mitsubishi introduced new painting equipment in its Okazaki and Mishima plants a couple years ago, he says, &quot;the quality went down, just the opposite of what management expected. So we modified the equipment and trained the people more. Then we got better quality, but it took us several months.&quot;    GM, which tried to push automation further and faster than any other auto maker, has learned this lesson the hard way. When the company's high-tech assembly plant in Hamtramck, Mich., opened in September 1985, for example, robots replaced humans in installing cars' windshields. But the robots couldn't gauge when to stop pressing on the glass, so a lot of windows broke.    Such episodes have earned GM heaps of criticism. &quot;GM has dragged the whole industry down&quot; in implementing automation, says Ronald L. Stewart, vice president for car and truck assembly at Chrysler. &quot;They've done things that were too much of a quantum leap. There's got to be evolution, not revolution.&quot;    GM officials, who have now solved the windshield-robot puzzle, concede the point. &quot;In the past we always looked for the big bang, but there's very little progress made that way,&quot; says Gabriel Tiberio, GM's executive director of advanced manufacturing engineering. &quot;Most comes from continuous improvement.&quot; He cites Honda Motor Co.'s windshield-installation system at its Ohio assembly plant as an example.    Until recently the plant used only semiautomated windshield installation. Robots would place the windshield directly in front of the opening, and two workers would guide the glass in by hand.    That's still the system on one of the plant's two assembly lines. But the other now uses an automated system in which robots install the glass, while a worker monitors the process on a small television screen and orders the robots to make adjustments when necessary. The system came on stream last November, after a five-month phase-in. &quot;We don't install new automation and just switch it on,&quot; a Honda spokesman says.    But some industry officials say that GM deserves at least some praise. &quot;It takes a pioneer proposing revolution to stimulate evolution,&quot; says Dennis M. Gillespie, an executive with the industrial computer group of Allen-Bradley Co., which supplies automation systems to auto makers. &quot;To some extent that is what GM did. They're taking a big rap, but they have pushed the industry forward.&quot;    Meanwhile, the effort to improve management practices while increasing automation is starting to pay off. Ford, for example, became more efficient at producing car-body panels after it completely examined its production system. &quot;We charted the tasks in boxes,&quot; says Mr. Herr, &quot;and concluded several of the boxes in the chart weren't necessary.&quot; So Ford cut the number of tasks to 11 from 19, partly because it could design dies with computers and thus eliminate model dies of wood and metal.    To Mr. Van Hull, this focus on the fundamentals is encouraging. &quot;For the first time people are pointing at the real gut-level issues,&quot; he says. &quot;It means we now can make some real changes in the way we run our businesses.&quot;    (See related stories: &quot;Airlines&quot;, &quot;Banking&quot;, &quot;Computers&quot;, &quot;Money Management&quot;, &quot;Petroleum&quot;, &quot;Pharmaceuticals&quot;, &quot;Publishing&quot;, &quot;Telecommunications&quot; and &quot;Behind the Report Cards&quot; -- WSJ June 12, 1987) </TEXT></DOC>
