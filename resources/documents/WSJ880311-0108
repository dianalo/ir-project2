What has changed? The initial shock and anger that met the announcement of the restructuring plan has started to wear off, prompting some investors to take a second look at the group. Meanwhile, speculative buying, fueled by rumors of sales of companies both in and out of the group, has heated up.    The group's shares have also been lifted by a general upturn in the Milan market. Since its Feb. 4 low of 890, the Milan index has jumped 16%, closing yesterday at 1028. But analysts maintain that the rebound was led by mainly technical factors, such as brokers covering short positions and by speculation, especially on stocks of the De Benedetti group, and caution that the boom may not last.    &quot;The initial reaction (to the Ferruzzi restructuring) was very emotional,&quot; says Maurizio Musatti, a financial analyst at Booz-Allen Hamilton Italia Ltd. But the Ferruzzi family's decision to join a consortium of underwriters for its public share offering, and Ferruzzi's purchase of Lesieur SA's edible-oil interests in France, he says, &quot;showed that they didn't lack resources as some had originally feared.&quot;    Paolo Santoro, managing director of the Gestnord mutual fund, adds that the market reacted badly to the plan &quot;more because of the abrupt manner in which it was presented than on its actual contents.&quot;    The plan calls for Ferruzzi Finanziaria, the family holding company that controls the Ferruzzi-Montedison group and is now closely held, to absorb Iniziativa Me.T.A. unit in a stock swap. Iniziativa is a publicly traded financial-services unit of Montedison S.p.A., which is 41.5%-owned by Ferruzzi Finanziaria.    The transaction will reduce Montedison's 7.8 trillion lire ($6.34 billion) debt by about 750 billion lire ($609.8 million), and an offering of the Ferruzzi shares received by Montedison is expected to raise an additional 1.2 trillion lire. Montedison also plans divestments that will raise between 800 billion lire and one trillion lire.    Montedison has already begun to sell off non-strategic holdings. in the past week, it sold its Rol lubricants operations to Kuwait Petroleum for an estimated 45 billion lire, and its 50% stake in Italbonder, a maker of chemical treatments for metals, for an additional 16.5 billion lire.    A Montedison spokesman declined to comment on rumors that the company's Standa unit may also be sold to Istituto per la Ricostruzione Industriale's Societa Meridionale Finanziaria food unit, but adds that &quot;there will be more divestments.&quot; An IRI spokesman also declined to comment on the rumored purchase, but added that &quot;we are always talking with many companies about possible partnerships.&quot;    Montedison has also indicated its willingness to resume contacts with state-owned Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi for a possible chemical joint venture. But the scale of such a venture would apparently be far smaller than originally envisioned, as Montedison has made clear that it won't share control of some of its most prized operations, including Himont Inc.    While such actions may have helped bolster the group's shares, many brokers say other reasons also played a role. &quot;Ferruzzi is starting to sell off parts of Montedison, but I'm not sure what investors will be left with,&quot; says one Milan broker. He asserted that much of the buying on the market is being done by &quot;the companies themselves and by the consortium of banks in order to guarantee a better outcome for the offering&quot; of Ferruzzi Finanziaria shares, scheduled for June.    Indeed, bad feelings still linger about the restructuring's perceived shabby treatment of minority shareholders -- who will trade their listed Iniziativa Me.T.A. shares for those of Ferruzzi Finanziaria, which hasn't yet released a consolidated balance sheet.    Francesco Micheli, vice president of Finarte S.p.A., a Milan financial holding company, says inadequate safeguards of minority shareholders' rights could hinder the flow of foreign investments into Italy. &quot;Foreign investors won't participate in a financial market in which one can conduct activities to the detriment of minority shareholders,&quot; says Mr. Micheli, an ally of former Montedison Chairman Mario Schimberni, who was ousted in November.    Such widely voiced criticisms appear to offer the hope that in the future, at least, more stringent controls will be in place. The Senate finance committee is applying the final touches to a bill that would make public offers mandatory in the cases of takeover attempts, corporate buy-backs and mergers of quoted and non-quoted companies. It isn't clear whether the law, if passed by Parliament, could be retroactively applied to the Ferruzzi-Iniziativa Me.T.A. merger.    But the current government's instability -- a reshuffle is expected after the 1988 budget is passed later this week -- could result in the postponement of such a law, and could cut the recent rally short, analysts warn.    &quot;I don't see any fundamental reason for an upward trend,&quot; says Paolo Azzoni, a partner in the Albertini brokerage house. &quot;No one knows where interest rates are going, the government is weak and the public debt is out of control.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
