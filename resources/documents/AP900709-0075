(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A northeast Arkansas school district istaking a forecaster's prediction to heart and has tentativelyplanned an early December earthquake break.   The South Mississippi County School District No. 57 won't holdclasses on Dec. 3-4, if the school board approves, in deference toclimatologist Iben Browning's prediction of a major earthquakealong the New Madrid Fault during that time.   Browning claims to have accurately predicted last fall'sNorthern California earthquake within one day. He also says hecorrectly predicted the 1971 earthquake in California's SanFernando Valley, a deadly earthquake in Nicaragua in 1972 anderuption of the Mount St. Helens volcano in 1980.   South Mississippi County Superintendent Harvey Barton said he istaking Browning seriously. Browning has predicted a quake for Dec.2 or 3, a Sunday and Monday. The district, north of Memphis, Tenn.,has canceled classes on Dec. 3 and 4. It will use that time forstaff development days mandated by the state Department ofEducation, Barton said.   ``Because we are a large rural area covering approximately 400square miles, transporting students would be a hardship if weshould have an earthquake,'' Barton said.   The New Madrid seismic zone stretches roughly from northeastArkansas northward to southern Illinois.   Communities that make up the South Mississippi County SchoolDistrict are within 30 miles of Marked Tree, the center of a seriesof great earthquakes measuring as high as 8.5 on the Richter scalethat rocked the area during the winter of 1811-12. U.S. GeologicalSurvey scientists consider those the strongest series of quakes inthe nation's recorded history.</TEXT></DOC>
