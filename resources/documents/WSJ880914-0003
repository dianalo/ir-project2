No effort is being spared to turn up ethical lapses on the part of anyone who ever shook the hand of Ronald Reagan or George Bush. But this exercise may backfire as it becomes clear how selective the ethical indignation is.    The latest attempt to document the Reagan administration's &quot;sleaze factor&quot; comes from the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, chaired by Colorado Democrat Patricia Schroeder. The committee's staff has compiled an index of newspaper articles on 242 &quot;individuals appointed by or serving in the Reagan administration who have been the subject of charges of unethical conduct.&quot; The document attempts to corral in one place every action that could conceivably be viewed in a bad light. At the same time, the staff notes that &quot;the allegations have not been further investigated by the subcommittee.&quot; A glance at some of the contents explains why:   --Lengthy items detail the charges brought against both Secretary of Labor Ray Donavan and NASA Administrator Jim Beggs. Each is then followed by a single sentence pointing out that both men were cleared of all charges.    --Daniel A. Manion, now a Judge for the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, is accused of never handling a case in which a federal constitutional issue was involved.    --Lawrence Uzzell, a special assistant at the Department of Education, &quot;advocated that every federal program for elementary and secondary education -- including aid to the handicapped -- be abolished.&quot;    --Perhaps the list's most curious entry, number 85, is: &quot;Rudolph W. Giuliani, Associate Attorney General, Department of Justice, was allegedly involved in a 1976 public corruption case.&quot;    The irony of labeling stuff like this as &quot;unethical&quot; is that Rep. Schroeder herself would appear on such a list if it applied to Members of Congress. Last week, the Journal's Jeffrey Birnbaum reported that she, her husband and two aides had used an Air Force jet to fly around Europe this spring on a fact-finding mission. Rep. Schroder called the article an &quot;attempt to confect a junket ... that was belabored beyond belief.&quot; Many of the individuals named in her committee's report would feel the same way.    Rep. Robert Walker, a Pennsylvania Republican, decided to do some comparison work with the Schroeder list. He took the same seven-year period and tried to establish a &quot;sleaze factor&quot; for Members of Congress. He found that the 242 names cited by the subcommittee represented 1.3% of the 18,270 individuals named to executive-branch positions by President Reagan since 1981. During the same period 635 individuals served as Members of Congress; at least 30, or 4.7%, have faced serious allegations of questionable conduct.    Does this mean that Members of Congress are more than three times more likely to be involved in ethical controversy? Of course not, but it points up the hypocrisy of peddling the &quot;sleaze factor&quot; line.    For example, consider a few of the current Members facing allegations of ethical misconduct:   --Harold Ford of Tennessee has been indicted on 19 counts of bank, mail and tax fraud in connection with a $350,000 loan allegedly diverted to his personal benefit.    --Robert Garcia of New York was named in the recent Wedtech trial of Rep. Mario Biaggi, who resigned after he was convicted. During the trial a Wedtech executive testified that he channeled $4,000 a month to Mr. Garcia's wife and another executive admitted other payments. The New York Times has called for an Ethics Committee investigation of Mr. Garcia.    --James Traficant of Ohio was found by a federal Tax Court judge last year to have accepted $108,000 in bribes from organized-crime figures while he was a county sheriff. The judge ruled that he owes the government back taxes and civil penalties.    --Fofo Sunia, the delegate from American Samoa, recently pleaded guilty to payroll abuses and last week he resigned his seat.    We frankly don't believe it is productive to engage in a &quot;I have a list&quot; exchange over politicians' ethics. Serious offenses should be investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted. But the value of ethical norms is devalued when different standards are applied to the executive and legislative branches.    For the past eight years, all the pious high-mindedness has been flowing in one direction. Some Members may think it's neat to compile a laundry list of the Reagan administration's crimes against &quot;ethics.&quot; It'll be less fun when their own colleagues start getting pulled away in the backwash. </TEXT></DOC>
