Thepurpose of all of this is to spread the gospel,'' Chicago lawyerMichael McConnell told the justices.   ``Now, all of us can be cynical, and with good purpose,''McConnell said in alluding to televangelist Jim Bakker's recentcriminal conviction. But McConnell said such taxation must beprohibited ``unless we are to say that all religious leaders arecharlatans.''   ``With religious organizations, the requirement of theConstitution is for the government to keep its hands off,'' he said.   McConnell's comments came after Justice John Paul Stevens,focusing on the sale of a tape-recorded sermon, asked how todistinguish a commercial sale from a religious activity.   The key question, McConnell responded, must be: ``Is it tospread the word or make a buck?''   Justice Thurgood Marshall then asked in an incredulous toneabout the Swaggart ministry: ``They weren't interested in a buck?''   ``The people involved draw substantial salaries, and thosesalaries stem from the sales'' of tapes, books and othermerchandise, Marshall said.   But McConnell said Swaggart's annual salary for the tax years atissue in his ministry's dispute with California tax officials neverexceeded $20,000.   The nation's highest court is to decide by July whetherCalifornia's sales and use tax, imposed on ``retailers'' for theprivilege of selling tangible goods in the state, must make anexception for religious items sold by religious groups.   California court rulings forced Swaggart's ministry to pay thestate $183,000 in back taxes and interest for 1974 through 1981.   McConnell attacked the tax as a violation of religious freedomand due process, and an undue interference with interstate commerce.   ``A religious organization carrying out its religious functioncannot be the occasion for fund-raising by the state,'' McConnellcontended.   He said the First Amendment, which ensures ``the free exercise''of religion, bars such taxation.   California Deputy Attorney General Richard Nielsen argued thattaxing sales made by Swaggart's ministry ``does not conflict withany asserted belief of Mr. Swaggart.''   ``Swaggart is using the free-exercise clause as a sword'' infighting for special treatment, Nielsen said.   The justices were told that California is the only stateimposing such taxes on religious organizations. But if the tax isupheld, other states would be free to do the same.   Both lawyers were peppered with questions from the bench, mostfrequently by Stevens and Justices Antonin Scalia and Sandra DayO'Connor.   Scalia challenged McConnell's assertion that the tax undulyinterferes with religious affairs. If the government may station apolice officer outside a church on Sunday to direct traffic, ``whycan't the government impose a non-discriminatory tax?'' he asked.   O'Connor asked several questions focusing on how great a burdenis created by the 6 percent state tax.   For the years at issue, mail-order sales from Swaggart's base inBaton Rouge, La., to California consumers totaled $1.7 million.Sales of merchandise at California crusades totaled $240,000.   The case is Jimmy Swaggart Ministries vs. Board of Equalization,88-1374.</TEXT></DOC>
