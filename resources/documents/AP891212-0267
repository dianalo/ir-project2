The administration is specifically looking at three HughesAircraft communication satellites, one due for launch by China inApril and the others in 1991 and 1992, that were held up by Bush'sban on export of weapons and satellites to China last June.   Two of the satellites are being built for Australia, and anAustralian official said Tuesday ``we basically get a positivesense'' from talks with the State Department on the possibility ofquick approval.   Roger Uren, political counselor at the Australian Embassy, said,``We've made it clear this is important to us. We have a sense theAmericans understand.''   The administration ``suspended the export of all items on ourmunitions list, which includes satellites and other items that arenot weapons,'' Fitzwater said, after the Chinese killing ofhundreds of demonstrators last spring.   ``We recognize that some items captured in the suspension herehave civilian applications and fall under the category of normalcommercial exports,'' he said.   He said the administration ``is reviewing these exports but hasnot reached any decision on granting waivers so that they mayproceed.''   Bush has encountered stiff criticism for opening the door forrenewed relations with China in the face of that nation's continuedactions against political dissent and in light of its record onhuman rights.   Meanwhile, a Bush administration official disclosed to TheAssociated Press that a third administration official, White Housepersonnel director Chase Untermeyer, had gone to Beijing on theadministration's mission to China last weekend.   The official did not say why Untermeyer went. The WashingtonPost said in Wednesday editions he visited two Chinese friends ofBush, a former ambassador to China, for their assessments of thesituation there.   Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., chairman of House Foreign Policysubcommittee on international economic policy and trade, saidTuesday after Fitzwater's comments, ``I suppose it shouldn'tsurprise me, after watching the administration fly to China withoutany change.''   ``In China, where the government has only tightened the screws,the Bush administration seems to see no limit on what they ought totry to do to help the Chinese government,'' Gejdenson said. ``Itmakes no sense whatsoever.''   In addition, House Democrats announced plans for a quick vote totry to override President Bush's veto of a bill aiding Chinesestudents in this country.   The vetoed bill, sponsored by Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California,would permit Chinese students to remain in the Unite Statesindefinitely if they fear retaliation at home. Bush says he isaccomplishing the same thing by executive order.   The administration already has allowed progress on someU.S.-China commerce since imposing the sactions that not onlycovered military items but nuclear supplies and any loans to Chinafrom the World Bank and the Asia Development Bank.   Bush said Monday that the sanctions remain in place, even thoughhe sent two emissaries _ National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroftand Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger _ to China overthe weekend and thus put an end to the suspension of high-levelcontacts between the two nations.   Fitzwater reiterated Tuesday the president's sentiment that``China needs to take certain actions to indicate a change in itsrepressive policies,'' before relations can be normalized.   Since the sanctions were imposed, the U.S. government hasallowed export of four Boeing jetliners, worth $650 million, withguidance systems that were on the U.S. munitions control list ofsensitive technology.   In addition, Chinese engineers have been allowed to return towork in the United States on a $500 million program to upgradeChinese F-8 fighter planes with sophisticated electronicsequipment. The White House said no planes were to be delivered, inkeeping with the export ban.   There has been no change in the deferral of $957 million inWorld Bank loans and $336 million in Asian development Bank loans,said Fitzwater.   Two of the satellites in question are being built by Hughesunder a $300 million contract with Australia which is using aChinese launch vehicle, and are due for launch in 1991 and 1992,said Hughes spokesman Don O'Neal in a telephone interview from LosAngeles. The third is a six-year-old Westar satellite beingrefurbished by Hughes for AsiaSat, a British-Chinese consortiumalso using a Chinese launch vehicle to put the satellite in orbitnext April.   Fitzwater said Hughes has told the administration it needs adecision ``relatively soon in order to meet the manufacturing anddelivery timetables and allow the launches to proceed on schedule.''   The Boeing planes, among 11 aircraft the contractor had on orderto Chinese commercial airlines, were to be delivered in June, saidBoeing spokesman Randy Harrison.   Bush's sanctions were to suspend their delivery unless and untilthe State Department and Commerce Department agreed with Boeing'sappeal that the navigation device in question was for civilianapplication and could not be removed for military use without beingobvious, Harrison said.   The government arms sales that have been suspended by thesanctions include a largely completed large-caliber artillerymanufacturing modernization program worth $28 million; $62 millionworth of artillery-locating radar, and $10 million worth ofsurface-launched antisubmarine torpedoes.   The administration is permitting subsidies for grain sales toChina, announcing on Dec. 5 that China was eligible to buy anadditional one million metric tons of wheat using ExportEnhancement Program subsidies.   The Chinese had used up almost all of their previous EEPallocation, a two-million-ton promise made when Bush visited Chinalast February. Nearly half the sales under that allocation havebeen made since the Tiananmen Square massacre.</TEXT></DOC>
