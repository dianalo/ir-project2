McNamara Jr. said Sunday hewill not resign despite a Justice Department investigation intoallegations that he lied when he said he saw his predecessor smokemarijuana.   ``This is a mountain out of a molehill,'' McNamara said. ``Ithink the whole thing has been a tremendous amount of nonsense. Youcan look for that office to continue to function as a professionaloffice with me at the helm.''   McNamara also said his own use of marijuana as recently as fouryears ago did not run counter to tough anti-drug pronouncements.   ``What I did is what a lot of people who grew up and went tocollege in the '60s and '70s did. I wish I hadn't done it. I'm nothappy I did it. It was a mistake,'' he said.   ``Perhaps out of that I can be even more committed to the waragainst drugs,'' he added.   McNamara, 41, the chief federal prosecutor for Massachusetts,faces a Justice Department inquiry into his claim to investigatorsthat his predecessor, William F. Weld, smoked marijuana at a 1982party in Virginia while still U.S. attorney.   The Justice Department reported last week that an inquiry foundevidence to contradict McNamara's assertion.   ``I want any questions that may exist in anybody's mind about mymotivations in this entire matter to be resolved,'' McNamara said ina telephone interview from his home in Bolton. ``That's why Irequested the investigation.''   McNamara refused to discuss the inquiry by the department'sOffice of Professional Responsibility or his accusations againstWeld, whom McNamara succeeded in April 1987.   McNamara said he planned to hold a staff meeting Monday todiscuss the charges, which aides said have virtually paralyzed the50-lawyer office that prosecutes all federal crimes in Massachusetts.   McNamara took over as U.S. attorney several weeks afer Weld leftfor Washington to head the Justice Department's criminal division.   The federal probe is examining whether McNamara made up themarijuana story because Weld had opposed his nomination on groundsthat other prosecutors had more experience. It also reportedly isexamining whether McNamara was forthright about smoking marijuanawhen he was questioned prior to confirmation for the job.</TEXT></DOC>
