National Geographic officials said the photographs were takenwith remote cameras lowered through a drill hole and that thechamber then was sealed, leaving the ancient craft undisturbed inits resting place.   A similar boat was found in a chamber nearby in 1954. That142-foot-long craft was excavated, reassembled and put in a museumspecially constructed for its display. Officials said that boat nowis decaying rapidly.   But new techniques permitted experts from the EgyptianAntiquities Organization and from the United States to survey thenew boat using remote cameras, the National Geographic announcedtoday. The boat was documented last October and its chamber thenwas sealed with the craft untouched.   The National Geographic said in a release that a jointU.S.-Egyptian team of scientists had hoped that the chambercontaining the new boat had remained airtight during the 46centuries since it was sealed.   In an effort to capture samples of that air, the scientists useda drill enclosed in an air lock. An arrangement of vacuum tubes wasused to suck the chamber's air into storage tanks for analysis.   ``The air in the chamber proved to be moderately polluted urbanair,'' said Pieter Tans, a scientist from the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration who analyzed the samples.   He said this proves that the chamber was not sealed andpossibily never was. Samples of the cap of the chamber, said Tans,showed that the rock was a light limestone.   ``The rock was so permiable that this pit probably has neverbeen sealed,'' he said.   Remote television pictures taken inside the chamber detected abeetle, which immediately proved, officials said, that the chamberhad been unsealed for some time.   Tans said the insect was identified as a common desert beetlethat feeds on fungi that is commonly found in decaying wood.   Television and still cameras lowered into the drill hole wereable to document the entire interior of the boat chamber. The TVcamera used fiber optics to light the chamber. In this way, thelights added no heat to tomb environment.   Photos released by the National Geographic show a mound of cedartimbers collapsed to the floor of a long chamber that had been cutwith precision out of solid limestone bedrock.   Scientists studying the pictures have identified various boatparts, including oar blades, deckhouse and hull planking. There wasno sign of a mast, sail or rigging.   The video camera detected hieroglyphic markings on the ceilingof the chamber. The National Geographic interpreted these symbolsas measurements and as the name of the team of workers who carvedthe stone used in the chamber.   The National Geographic announcement said the purposes of theboat, and of its sister craft excavated in 1954, remain a mystery.   ``Why did the ancient Egyptians disassemble and bury twofull-size royal ships at the base of the Great Pyramid?'' theannouncement asks.   The boats are thought to have been entombed to honor the PharoahKhufu by his son and successor Djedefre, according to the NationalGeographic.   But it is not known if the boats were used to bring Khufu's bodyon the Nile from his palace at Memphis to the pyramid at Giza, orif the craft were entombed in the belief that Khufu would use themin an afterlife.   A report on the exploration of the boat chamber is carried inthe April issue of National Geographic, the monthly magazine of theNational Geographic Society.</TEXT></DOC>
