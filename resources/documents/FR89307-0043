Overview of Proposed Actions</ITAG>Under section 112 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), EPA is required to establishemission standards for hazardous air pollutants at a level which providesan ample margin of safety to protect public health. In <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. EPA, </T3> 824 F.2d 1146(1987) (hereafter referred to as <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>), the Court set out a two-step decision processfor EPA to follow in setting NESHAPs under section 112. The two steps are:(1) Determine a ``safe'' or ``acceptable'' health risk level and (2) setthe standard at the level_which may be lower but not higher than the ``safe''or ``acceptable'' level_that protects public health with an ample marginof safety. The Administrator may instead use only one step to set standards,but if he does this, he may not consider cost or technology.As discussed in detail in Section VI of this notice, the Agency is, asit did in the proposed Benzene NESHAP, 53 FR 28496, proposing four alternativepolicy approaches for making these two decisions under section 112. Commentorsshould understand that the final decision on the NESHAP approach couldbe one of the four described in this notice or a variation. The final policyapproach and the relative weight it gives to the various risk measuresand uncertainties may become the framework for future NESHAPs decisions.Consequently, the Agency is interested in comments on general implicationsof the various policy approaches in addition to comments on the specificapplications to the twelve radionuclide source categories.The framework adopted for NESHAPs does not apply to other Agency programs.The Court's interpretation of the process required for establishing NESHAPsdid not extend to regulatory decisions under any other section of the CAAor other statute administered by EPA: therefore, the Agency does not envisionapplying the process described below to regulatory judgments under otherActs. Regulatory decisions under other Acts will continue to be made usingdecisional approaches pursuant to those distinct statutory mandates.The various policy approaches being proposed differ in how the questionof acceptable risk is addressed and in how uncertainty in risk measuresis considered. The Agency is using both the four proposed approaches andthe applications of the approaches to the radionuclide source categoriesas a means to further frame the public debate on these questions. The Agencybelieves that the broad ramifications of any particular approach for establishingacceptable risk levels for all NESHAPs should be subject to informed publicdebate.A. Safe or Acceptable Risk Policy Approaches Each of the four approaches treats the acceptable risk decision differently.The major characteristics of the four proposed approaches to acceptablerisk and ample margin of safety decisions are described below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach </ITAG>This is the only approach in which all the health information, risk measuresand potential biases, underlying assumptions, and quality of the information(i.e., uncertainties) are considered together in the acceptable risk decision.The preferred level for the maximum individual lifetime risk in this approachis 10<T3>^</T3>\4\ or less; however, different results for specific source categoriesmay be reached based on consideration of all the available information.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach </ITAG>This approach only considers EPA's best estimate of the total incidenceof fatal cancer in the acceptable risk decision. The other health information,including individual risk and the uncertainties, are not considered untilthe ample margin step. The incidence level being proposed as acceptableis no more than 1 case of fatal cancer per year per source category. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Approach C. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG><T3>^</T3>\4\ or Less Maximum Individual Risk Approach For this approach, the only parameter considered in determining acceptablerisk is EPA's best estimate of the maximum individual lifetime risk offatal cancer. The other health information including incidence, and theuncertainties, are considered in the ample margin step. In this approach,a maximum individual lifetime risk of no greater than 1andmultiply;10<T3>^</T3>\4\ is acceptable. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Approach D. 1andmultiply;10</ITAG><T3>^</T3>\6\ or Less Maximum Individual Risk Approach This approach is similar to Approach C, however, acceptable risk is definedas a maximum individual lifetime risk of no greater than 1andmultiply;10<T3>^</T3>\6\. B. Ample Margin of Safety Decision This decision is made separately after the safe determination has beenmade. The Administrator considers all the health risk measures as wellas the technological feasibility, costs, estimation uncertainties, economicimpacts of control technologies and any other relevant information. Anissue that arises in this decision is whether to require all technologicallyfeasible controls which are affordable no matter how small the risk reduction.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Historical Background of Radiation NESHAPs </ITAG>On December 27, 1979, EPA listed radionuclides as a hazardous air pollutantunder section 112 of the CAA [44 FR 76738 (December 27, 1979)]. EPA determinedthat radionuclides are a known cause of cancer and genetic damage and thatradionuclides cause or contribute to air pollution that may reasonablybe anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increase inserious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness, constitutinga hazardous air pollutant as defined by section 112(a)(1). EPA then determinedthat radionuclides presented a risk warranting regulation under section112, and listed the pollutant under that section. Having listed radionuclidesas a hazardous air pollutant, EPA was then required by section 112(b)(1)(B)to establish National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants(NESHAPs) at the ``level which [in the judgment of the Administrator] providesan ample margin of safety to protect the public health from such hazardousair pollutant,'' or find that they are not hazardous and delist them. On April 6, 1983, EPA proposed standards regulating radionuclide emissionsfrom four source categories: (1) Elemental phosphorus plants, (2) DOE facilities,(3) NRC licensed facilities and non-DOE federal facilities (NRC-licensees),and (4) underground uranium mines. The Agency simultaneously proposed itsdecision not to regulate several other categories: (1) Coal-fired boilers,(2) the phosphate industry, (3) other extraction industries, (4) uraniumfuel cycle facilities, (5) uranium mill tailings, (6) high level radioactivewaste facilities, and (7) low energy accelerators [48 FR 15076 (April 6,1983)]. In February 1984, the Sierra Club filed suit in the U.S. DistrictCourt for the Northern District of California to compel EPA to take finalaction on the proposed standards. <T3>Sierra Club v. Ruckelshaus,</T3> No. 84-0656. EPA was subsequentlyordered by the Court to promulgate final standards or make a finding thatradionuclides are not hazardous air pollutants and delist them. In October 1984, EPA withdrew the proposed emission standards for elementalphosphorus plants, DOE facilities, and NRC licensees, finding that thecontrol practices already in effect for those categories protected thepublic from exposure to radionuclides with an ample margin of safety. EPA,therefore, concluded that no additional regulation would be necessary [49FR 43906 (October 31, 1984)]. In the notice, EPA also withdrew the proposed standard for undergrounduranium mines but stated its intention to promulgate a different standardfor that category and simultaneously published an Advance Notice of ProposedRulemaking (ANPR) for radon-222 emissions from underground uranium minesto solicit additional information on control methods. EPA also publishedan ANPR for radon-222 emissions from licensed uranium mills. EPA affirmedits decision not to regulate the other categories: coal-fired boilers,the phosphate industry, other extraction industries, uranium fuel cyclefacilities, and high level radioactive waste. The Agency decided not toregulate phosphogypsum stacks under section 112 at that time, but insteadto further study the category to determine whether the need for a standardexisted. On December 11, 1984, the U.S. District Court for the Northern Districtof California found EPA in contempt of its order to promulgate final standardsand again directed that EPA issue final radionuclide emission standardsfor the original four categories or make a finding that radionuclides arenot hazardous air pollutants. EPA complied with the court order by promulgatingstandards for radionuclides emissions from elemental phosphorus plants,DOE facilities, and NRC-licensees [50 FR 7280 (February 6, 1985)] and awork practice standard for radon-222 emissions from underground uraniummines [50 FR 15385 (April 17, 1985)]. On September 24, 1986, EPA promulgateda final rule regulating radon-222 emissions from licensed uranium millprocessing sites by establishing work practices for new tailings [51 FR34056 (September 24, 1986)].The Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), the Natural Resources Defense Council(NRDC), and the Sierra Club filed petitions for review of the October 1984withdrawals and final decisions not to regulate, the February 1985 standardsfor the three source categories and the April 1985 standard for undergrounduranium mines. The April 1985 standard for underground uranium mines wasalso challenged by the American Mining Congress (AMC). In November 1986,AMC and EDF filed petitions challenging the standard for licensed uraniummill processing sites.On July 28, 1987, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit remandedto the Agency an emissions standard for vinyl chloride which had also beenpromulgated under section 112 of the CAA. The Court in <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>concluded that the Agency improperly consideredcost and technological feasibility without first making a determinationbased exclusively on risk to health. In light of that decision, EPA concluded that the standards for elementalphosphorus plants, DOE facilities, NRC-licensees, and underground uraniummines should be reconsidered and on November 16, 1987, moved the Courtfor a voluntary remand of those NESHAPs. EPA also agreed to reexamine allissues raised by the parties to the litigation. On December 8, 1987, theCourt granted EPA's motion for voluntary remand and established a timeschedule for EPA to propose regulatory decisions for all radionuclide sourcecategories within 180 days and finalize them within 360 days. On March17, 1988, the Court granted a subsequent EPA motion and modified the orderto require proposed regulatory decisions by February 28, 1989 and finalaction by August 31, 1989.On April 1, 1988, EPA also requested a remand for its standard for licenseduranium mill tailings. On August 3, 1988 the Court granted EPA'a motionand put the uranium mill tailings NESHAP on the same schedule as the otherradionuclide NESHAPs.On remand, EPA intends to take a ``fresh look'' at the risks and issuesinvolved in regulating or not regulating radionuclide emissions under section112 of the CAA. This means that the Agency is not bound by previous statements,positions or decisions. The Agency will or will not regulate sources basedon whether or not their emissions protect public health with an ample marginof safety as determined during this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Characterization of the Risks of Radiation</ITAG>A. Sources of RadiationEvery day each person is exposed to radiation from a variety of naturaland manmade sources. Natural sources of radiation include cosmic rays,radon, and other terrestrial sources. Manmade radiation includes medicaland dental X-rays, fallout from above ground nuclear weapons testing andindsutrial sources.The earth's atmosphere acts as a shield to cosmic rays, absorbing muchof the radiation. People receive a higher dose of cosmic rays at higheraltitudes because there is less atmosphere to shield them from cosmic rays.For example, people living in the mountains receive a higher dose thanpeople living at sea level, and people are exposed to even higher levelswhen flying in an airplane. Terrestrial radiation comes from the smallamount of radionuclides that are naturally present in all matter: soil,air, food, clothes, and even our bodies.Radon is a radionuclide that is produced as a radioactive decay productof the radium which is naturally found in soil. Radon is always presentin the ambient air where it poses some health risk. In addition, radonoften gets trapped in homes, leading to even higher health risks. EPA hasissued recommendations to homeowners for reducing these risks.This rulemaking deals with sources of radionuclide emissions, includingradon, from industrial sources. Although the amount of radiation dose thatmost people receive as a result of these emissions is lower than theirnatural background dose, the resulting risk can still be signficant. Asource does not present an acceptable risk simply by being less than naturalbackground. It is important to note that total background radiation fromall sources, including naturally occurring radon, results in a calculatedmaximum lifetime risk of fatal cancer of approximately 1andmultiply;10^2.In most cases, little can be done to reduce most of this radiation exposurewhich people receive from natural background.Industrial sources of radionuclide emissions in the air include a widevariety of facilities, ranging from nuclear power facilities to hospitalsto uranium mill tailing piles. Industry uses hundreds of distinct radionuclidesin solid, liquid, and gaseous forms, emitting different types of radiation(alpha, beta, gamma) at various energy levels.Industrial sources of radionuclide emissions fall into two major categories.The industries that use radioactive materials have emissions as a resultof an inability to completely contain the materials they use. For example,hospitals use radionuclides as part of their radiology departments. Sincemany of the radionuclides they use are gases, liquids capable of evaporation,or solids capable of sublimation, some radionuclides inevitably are releasedinto the environment. The other type of source is that which releases radionuclides(usually radon) as an unintended consequence of other activity, such asmining or milling. An example of this is phosphogypsum stacks. These pilesemit radon because radium (from which radon is produced by radioactivedecay) is found naturally in the same soils that are the source of phosphaterock.B. Health Effects of Radiation The level and type of hazard posed by radionuclides vary, depending onsuch characteristics as the radionuclide's radioactive half-life, the typeof radiation it emits, the energy level of the emission(s), and its abilityto concentrate in the body. Different radionuclides will irradiate differentparts of the body causing different types of cancers. There are three major types of long-term health impacts from exposure toradiation: Cancer, hereditary effects, and developmental effects on fetusessuch as mental retardation. Since there is such a strong basis for quantifyingthe risk from fatal cancers, EPA's consideration of fatal cancers is thedriving force in this rulemaking. However, it is important to note thatother health effects have been considered as well in the rulemaking. Theother effects are not specifically addressed in this discussion becausenone of them pose a more severe risk to health. Therefore, judging therisk of total fatal cancers acceptable is judging the other effects acceptable.In addition, risk distribution of health effects from radiation from mostof the sources considered for regulation show that fatal cancers occurmuch more frequently than non-fatal cancers and cancers generally occurmore often than genetic or developmental effects. For sources that emitradon, no genetic or developmental effects and very few non-fatal cancersare expected. Numerous studies have demonstrated that radiation is a carcinogen. It isassumed that there is no completely risk-free level of exposure of radiationfor cancer. The risks from radiation have been observed in studies of workersand of the survivors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This information has beenverified with studies of animals in the laboratory. However, the effectsof doses at low levels of exposure can only be predicted by extrapolatingfrom the observed effects at higher doses since cancers caused by radiationcannot be distinguished from ones with other causes. Some pollutants causediseases that are unique to the pollutant, for example, asbestos and asbestosis.Radiation, however, causes the same types of cancers that are caused byother factors, such as leukemia and lung and liver cancer. Since thesecancers are not unique to radiation effects, it is impossible to differentiatecancers caused by radiation from other cancers. The second type of effect is the induction of hereditary effects in discendantsof exposed persons, which vary in degree and may be fatal. It is assumedthat there is no completely risk-free level of exposure for hereditaryeffects. Although hereditary effects have been observed in experimentalanimals at high doses, they have not been confirmed at low doses in studiesof humans. Based on extensive scientific evidence, it is prudent to assume that atlow levels of exposure, the risk of incurring either cancer or hereditaryeffects is linearly proportional to the dose received in the revelant tissue.However, the severity of either effect is not related to the amount ofdose received. That is, once a cancer or an hereditary effect has beeninduced, its severity is independent of the dose. Regarding cancer, there continues to be divided opinion on how to interpolatebetween the absence of radiation effect at zero dose and the observed effectsof radiation (mostly at high doses) in order to estimate the most probableeffects at doses that represent small increases above natural backgroundradiation. Most scientists believe that available data best support useof a linear model for estimating such effects. Others, however, believethat other models, which usually predict somewhat lower risk, provide betterestimates. These differences of opinion have not been resolved to databy studies of the effects of radiation in humans, the most important ofwhich are those of the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombs.It is important to note that no one receives a zero dose of radiation.All doses received by people as a result of emissions from industrial sourcesare in addition to the natural background dose. Studies are now underway to reassess radiation dose calculations for thesesurvivors and to provide improved estimates of risk. These studies mayreduce the uncertainty associated with extrapolation from high doses tolow doses. These studies may also result in an increase of the estimatedrisk per unit dose. But they will not address the question of whether athreshold exists. EPA is monitoring the progress of this work and willinitiate reviews of the risks of exposure to low levels of radiation uponits completion. It could be argued that the approach taken understates the risk to an exposedindividual. Two important and unquantifiable factors can lead to an underestimationof risk. The first is the possibility of greater susceptibility of somemembers of the population to radiation. The other factor that EPA cannotquantify is the synergistic effects of radiation with other pollutants.Radiation is only one of a number of carcinogens in the environment. WhileEPA's relative risk model takes into account the effect of chemicals thatare widely distributed in the environment, there are hundreds of chemicalsthat are concentrated in local areas, and the effects of these chemicalsare not and can not be taken into account. C. Risk AssessmentEPA estimates numerical risk in several ways in this rulemaking. One isthe maximum risk to which any individual would be exposed for his or herentire lifetimes, 70 years on the average. Another is to estimate the numberof fatal cancers that will be caused by the annual radionuclide emissionsfrom the studied facility. Another is to estimate how many persons withina certain distance of a source of pollutant emissions are at what levelof individual risk. A risk distribution estimates how many persons withina certain distance of a source of pollutant emissions are at what levelof individual risk. Typically, the distribution is given for 10-fold incrementsof individual risk. Such a distribution provides the decisionmaker withinformation on both the individual risk level for those exposed and thenumber of persons exposed at each level. For NESHAP and other decisions,the Agency has examined risk distributions both as measures of risk andto compare the effects of various strategies for risk reductions acrossa source category.In attempting to make these estimates, EPA has tried at all times to give``best estimates'' of the radionuclide concentrations in the environmentand individual and population risks. Wherever possible, measured or reporteddata of emissions, meteorology and population were used. Where estimateswere used, EPA has tried to use the most likely numbers in its assessments.When model facilities were used, they were designed to be representativeof actual facilities. EPA's risk assessments are based on a current ``snapshot''of each industrial source category as it now stands. EPA has not estimatedthe maximum conceivable risks that may result from the facilities analyzedat some point in the future. Future risk may be higher or lower dependingon whether people move closer to, or further away from, the facilitiesstudied and whether the emissions from those facilities increase or decrease.This is not to say that there is little or no uncertainly in the finalresults. As in all such assessments, the analysis have considerable uncertainly.EPA's analysis are not designed to consistently over- or underestimaterisks.The level of uncertainty is greater in the estimate of the maximum individualrisk than in the estimate of population risk. Many possible errors in analysiscancel out in assessments of populations. For example, the results frompollutant dispersion models may be in error. For example, local meteorologicalconditions may cause more radionuclides to go in one direction than another.This effect may cause an over- or underestimate of the maximum individualrisk, depending on where the most exposed individual is located. However,this source of error tends to be less important in population estimates,since the analysis integrates individual doses to a large number of people.If one person gets a larger risk due to local dispersion effects, it meansthat another person is getting less. Consequently, when the individualrisks are summed, local conditions will not cause a serious error in thevalue for total population risk.In estimating the radiation exposure to the meet exposed individual, EPAassumes that the person receiving the maximum individual risk lives fora lifetime, an average of 70 years, at the same site. EPA has assumed,<T3>a priori, </T3>that the person exposed to the maximum individual risklives at the point of maximum exposure his whole life. EPA then makes itsbest estimate of the risks to the individual of living his entire lifetimeunder a set of certain conditions.EPA makes this assumption as a matter of policy and does not believe thatit undercuts the accuracy of risk assessments. It is not meant to be a``best guess'' of how people live. EPA has made this assumption for severalreasons. First, EPA is attempting to estimate the maximum individual riskand it is completely possible that someone could live in the same placefor that person's entire life. Use of different assumptions could lead,in some cases, to understanding the maximum risk.Second, a considerable fractions or risk can occur in less than 70 years.The effect of radiation and risk are not independent of age. Children appearto be a more susceptible to the effects of radiation than adults. In addition,due to their youth, they generally have a greater chance of developingthe cancer the radiation would cause (and they are less likely to die ofsomething else before they die of cancer). Due to these two factors, youngerpeople are at a greater risk from the same dose than older people. (SeeTable 1). If EPA were to reduce the number of years of assumed exposureto less than a lifetime, it would be unclear what number of years to useor where to place those years. For example, should EPA assume that theperson lives in the same place from birth to age 19 or from age 35 to 50?Generally, in the first case the risk is 6 times greater than in the secondcase. Finally, the difference that would be caused by assuming a shorterperiod of exposure is not very significant. For an assumed constant rateof exposure, people receive over 60 percent of their total lifetime riskduring their first nineteen years. To change the period of exposure from70 years to the first 19 years of life would change the final result byless than a factor of 2.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>1._<T4>Age Dependence of Risk Due to Whole Body Radiation</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Assumed Percentage of Total Lifetime Risk As A Function Of Ages AtWhich Radiation Exposure Occurs]</ITAG><H1>Period of exposure (ages)</H1><H1>Percentage of lifetime risk</H1><H1>Cumulative percentage of lifetime risk \1\</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">0 to 9<D>30</D><D>30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 to 19<D>30</D><D>60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">20 to 34<D>20</D><D>80</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35 to 50<D>10</D><D>90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">50+<D>10</D><D>100</D><F>\1\ Exposure is at a constant rate for a lifetime.</F></ITAG></ITAG>D. Computer Models<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Clean Air Act Assessment Package_1988 (CAP-88)</ITAG>In this rulemaking, EPA uses the Clean Air Act Assessment Package_1988(CAP-88) in risk analysis and to estimate the dose and risk resulting fromradionuclide emissions to air. CAP-88 is a set of computer programs, databases and associated programs that model the transport of radionuclidesfrom the emission point through the environment to exposed human populationsand estimates the resulting dose and health impact. For more informationon the source of data used in CAP-88, see the BID.<T3>a. Environmental transport of radionuclides. </T3>The computer programwhich models environmental transport in CAP-88 is AIRDOS-EPA. This programuses a modified Gaussian plume equation to estimate both horizontal andvertical dispersion of radionuclides released from up to six sources. Thesources may be either elevated stacks, such as a smokestack, or reasonablyuniform area sources, such as a pile of uranium mill tailings. Plume risescan be calculated assuming either a momentum-driven or buoyancy-drivenplume. Assessments are done for a circular area within a radius of 80 kilometers(50 miles) around the facility.AIRDOS-EPA computes radionuclide concentrations in air, rates of depositionon ground surfaces, concentrations in food and intake rates to people frominhalation of air and ingestion of food produced in the assessment area.Estimates of the radionuclide concentrations in produce, milk and meatconsumed by humans are made by coupling the output of the atmospheric transportmodels with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Regulatory Guide 1.109terrestrial food chain models. The computer program PREPAR is used to preparethe input data for use by AIRDOS-EPA. This is done to insure proper formattingof the large arrays required to do environmental transport calculations.These arrays include the agricultural productivity data, population distributionsand meteorological data. PREPAR also passes on information on the fractionof food which is assumed to be home-grown, the fraction taken from productionwithin the 80-km assessment area, and the fraction of uncontaminated foodimported from outside the assessment area.Population distributions are generated with the utility program SECPOP,which uses a data base of 1980 Census data. Since census enumeration districtsvary widely in their size, the census data base is not very precise atestimating population groups close to the facility, and the arrays haveto be modified with supplemental site specific data.Meteorological data required to estimate the dispersion of radionuclidesin air is either supplied from on-site weather stations or generated fromstability arrays (STAR files) which are available from the National Oceanicand Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), U.S. Department of Commerce. Thesedata are generated from weather data reported from airports across thenation and include the frequencies of wind direction, wind speed and stabilitycategory. Where on-site data are not available, and a reporting stationis not close by, data are selected from the nearest reporting station judgedto have similar weather conditions. The annual average rainfall rate isestimated for each facility from historical climatic data.<T3>b. Estimation of dose and risk. </T3>The computer program RADRISK isused to estimate dose and risk conversion factors. Factors are providedfor the pathways of ingestion and inhalation intake, ground level air immersionand ground surface irradiation. Factors are further broken down by particlesize, solubility class and digestion transfer factors. These factors aregenerated once and stored in a data base for future use. The data baseused for the 1988 rulemaking is RADRISK.V8401RBM. For more informationconcerning this data base, see the BID.Estimation of dose and risk is made by the program DARTAB, which combinesthe inhalation and ingestion intake rates, and the air and ground surfaceconcentrations output from AIRDOS-EPA with the dose and risk conversionfactors from the RADRISK data base. DARTAB lists the dose and risk to themaximum individual, the average individual and the collective population.Doses and risks are further tabulated as a function of radionuclide, pathway,location and organ.DARTAB also tabulates the number of people in each risk category, as wellas the number of health effects from each risk category. Risk categoriesrepresent the lifetime risk and are computed by powers of ten from onein ten (1andmultiply;10^1) to one in a million (1andmultiply;10^6).<T3>c. Limitations of the CAP-88 methodology. </T3>There are some limitationsin the mathematical dispersion models that are available in CAP-88. TheCAP-88 codes have been verified, and improvements will be made on a continuingbasis as new techniques become available.While up to six stack or area sources can be modeled, all the sources aremodeled as if co-located at the same point; that is, stacks cannot be locatedin different areas of a facility. No correction for the diffusion introducedby building wakes or tip downwash can be made. Also, area sources are treatedas uniform and co-located. Variation in radionuclide concentrations dueto complex terrain cannot be modeled; all assessments assume a flat plain.Errors arising from these assumptions will have a negligible effect forassessments where the distance to exposed individuals is large comparedto the stack height, area or facility size.<T3>d. Verification of the CAP-88 methodology. </T3>The Gaussian plumemodel used in CAP-88 to estimate dispersion of radionuclides in air isone of the most commonly used models. It produces results that agree withexperimental data as well as other models, is fairly easy to work with,and is consistent with the random nature of turbulence.The Office of Radiation Programs has made comparisons between the predictionsof annual-average ground-level concentration to actual environmental measurementsand found very good agreement. In the recent paper ``Comparison of AIRDOS-EPAPrediction of Ground-Level Airborne Radionuclide Concentrations to MeasuredValues'', environmental monitoring data at five Department of Energy (DOE)sites were compared to AIRDOS-EPA predictions. EPA concluded that, as oftenas not, AIRDOS-EPA predictions are within a factor of 2 of actual concentrations.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. COMPLY</ITAG>This section deals with the compliance procedures that the Agency has developedto implement the NESHAPs for NRC-licensees. Most of the estimated 6,000facilities subject to the rule possess very small quantities of radioactivematerials, and under normal conditions they will not exceed the standard.In cooperation with the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements(NCRP), a group chartered by Congress to develop basic concepts about radiationmeasurement and protection, EPA has developed a system for implementingthe CAA that is easy to use and that reduces the burden of demonstratingcompliance for small facilities. The NCRP assisted the Agency by developinga simplified screening model allowing the regulated community to calculatedose based on: emissions to the atmosphere, distance to the receptor, buildingdimensions, and other readily available information. The NCRP model employsa Gaussian plume air dispersion model which was modified to take into considerationbuilding wake effects. It calculates dose through four exposure pathways:Inhalation, ingestion, immersion, and radionuclides deposits on the ground.It was developed by the NCRP to provide a simple method for calculatingradiation dose from releases of radioactivity to the atmosphere. The NCRP model is intentionally designed to overestimate the dose bothto maintain simplicity for hand calculation, and because it was intendedfor screening purposes only. The model is presented in NCRP CommentaryNo. 3, ``Screening Techniques for Determining Compliance with EnvironmentalStandards.'' To augment these procedures, the EPA has developed a methodallowing the regulated community to estimate a source term for the modelsin lieu of measured release rates. Simple compliance procedures for theregulated community have been devised based on these considerations. The process consists of providing the regulated community with a seriesof ways to make increasingly more accurate estimates, depending on theirpotential to exceed the standard. First, a facility can be found in complianceif the quantity of radioactive material possessed during the year is lessthan that listed in a table of annual possession quantities (Appendix E,Table 1). The table of annual possession quantity has been derived usingEPA's emission factors in collaboration with the NCRP screening model.The table assumes that the nearest resident is 10 meters from the pointof release while food is produced at 100 meters. A facility will also be in compliance if the average annual radionuclideemission concentration is less than that listed in a table of air concentrationlevels (Appendix E, Table 2). This table is based on the effective doseequivalent calculated by the NCRP screening model assuming that the residentand the source of food production are located at the point of release.If the facility is not demonstrated to be in compliance by using thesetables, it can establish compliance by estimating a dose using the NCRPscreening model with a radiological source term derived using EPA approvedemission factors. These procedures are described in ``Guide for DeterminingCompliance with the Clean Air Act Standards for Radionuclide Emissionsfrom NRC-Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.'' A user-friendly computer program called COMPLY has been developed to reducethe burden on the regulated community. The Agency has also prepared a ``User'sGuide for the COMPLY Code'' to assist the regulated community in usingthe code, and in handling more complex situations such as multiple releasepoints. The compliance model, which is an extension of the NCRP screening model,is the last stage of the COMPLY computer code. The compliance model wasdeveloped by EPA to decrease overestimation of the dose estimates by allowinginput of site-specific information by user. The differences between thecompliance model and the screening models developed by NCRP are as follows:1. The compliance model allows the use of more complete meteorologicaldata_the frequency with which the wind blows in a given direction and theaverage wind speed in that direction (a wind rose). 2. It accounts for momentum or buoyant plume rise. 3. It allows for a more precise determination of the locations for thesources of food production. 4. It uses more realistic pathway parameters from AIRDOS-EPA as opposedto the conservative pathway parameters selected by NCRP for screening purposes.These differences make the compliance model more realistic than the NCRPmodel, which was designed to be simple enough to be implemented using ahand calculator. Comparisons of the dose calculated using the compliancemodel to that calculated using the AIRDOS-EPA code at the same air concentration,show that the two codes produce essentially the same results for inhalationand immersion. The compliance model predicts dose rates that are somewhatgreater than AIRDOS-EPA values for ingestion and radioactivity depositedon the ground.More radionuclides are contained in the COMPLY computer code than are inNCRP Commentary No. 3 and the tables to calculate dose for Subpart I. TheAgency intends to expand the list of nuclides for the hand calculationalprocedures and is interested in soliciting comments on which nuclides shouldbe added.E. Effective Dose EquivalentSince 1985, when EPA proposed dose standards regulating NRC-licensees andDOE facilities, a different methodology for calculating dose has come intowidespread use, the effective dose equivalent (EDE). In 1987, EPA, in recommendingto the President new standards for all workers exposed to radiation, acceptedthis methodology for the regulation of doses from radiation. This method,which was originally developed by ICRP, will be used in all the dose standardsproposed by EPA in this notice. In the past, EPA dose standards were specifiedin terms of limits for specific organ doses and the ``whole body dose,''a methodology which is no longer consistent with current practices of radiationprotection.The EDE is simple, is more closely related to risk and is recommended bythe leading national and international advisory bodies. By changing tothis new methodology, EPA will be converting to the common internationalmethod for calculating dose. This will make it easier for the regulatedcommunity to understand and meet our standards.The EDE is the weighted sum of the doses to the individual organs of thebody. The dose to each organ is weighted according to the risk that doserepresents. These organ doses are then added together and that total isthe effective dose equivalent. In this manner the risk from different sourcesof radiation can be controlled by a single standard. The weighting factorsfor the individual organs are listed in Table 2:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s10,8</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Weighting Factors for Individual Organs</T4><H1>Organ</H1><H1>Factor</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Lung<D>.12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Breast<D>.15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Thyroid<D>.03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gonads<D>.25</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Bone surface<D>.03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Red bone marrow<D>.12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Remainder<D>.30</D></ITAG></ITAG>EPA risk models differ from those underlying the ICRP recommendations.The risks calculated by EPA are not strictly proportional to the EDE derivedusing ICRP quality factors and organ weighting factors. While the riskmethodology underlying the ICRP EDE differs from that used by EPA, thewidespread acceptance of the EDE approach, and the small likelihood thata regulation based on this concept would allow an unacceptable risk makeit a reasonable basis for regulation under the CAA.F. Science Advisory Board ReviewBeginning in 1984, EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) has conducted reviewsof the risk assessment methods used in this rulemaking. EPA has workedclosely with the SAB with respect to their comments and findings and believesit has been responsive to them.In 1984, the SAB recommended that available scientific information be integratedinto an assessment document that would lead from identification of emissionsources through calculation of radiation dose and health risk and the associateddegrees of uncertainty; a full explanation of procedures to be provided.This has been done in the Environmental Impact Statement accompanying thisrulemaking.In 1988, the SAB reviewed the dose-risk conversion factors for low-LETradiation and for radon and the source terms and environmental pathwaymodels used by EPA in the risk assessments which are considered in thisrulemaking. Given below are specific SAB comments and the Agency's responses:<T3>SAB comment: </T3>EPA should use the effective dose equivalent conceptfor regulations protecting people from exposure to radiation.<T3>EPA response: </T3>This is done in the proposed rules.<T3>SAB comment: </T3>EPA should use simple screening methods in implementationprocedures such that only the largest users of radionuclides are requiredto report annually to EPA.<T3>EPA response: </T3>A simple screening procedure is proposed.<T3>SAB comment: </T3>SAB has given specific advice on risk factors forlow-LET and for radon.<T3>EPA response: </T3>The SAB approaches to these risk factors have beenused in the risk assessments supporting this rulemaking.<T3>SAB comment: </T3>EPA should improve presentation of risk by clearlystating assessment objectives, presenting the number of people exposedand health impacts in terms of individual risk ranges, defining input/outputparameters clearly, and comparing risks with commonly encountered risks.<T3>EPA response: </T3>Assessment objectives are carefully defined in theEIS in terms of the individuals and populations at risk. The number ofpeople at risk and incidence is presented by range of risk. Summaries ofinputs and outputs of the computer code models have been placed in thedocket. Radiation risks are compared with other risks and other radiationcontrol recommendations.<T3>SAB comment: </T3>EPA should rigorously derive quantified uncertaintyestimates for each risk assessment.<T3>EPA response: </T3>This is a large task. For the short term, priorto the final rule, we will perform parameter sensitivity analysis of themost important parameters using simplifying assumptions. For the long term,an Agency task group has been formed to plan and conduct more completestudies of the uncertainty question. This longer term effort will takea number of years to complete.EPA acknowledges the uncertainty in risk estimates, considers them whenmaking risk management decisions and recognizes that a quantitative expressionof uncertainty would be an improvement. However, it does not believe thatthe quantitative expression of uncertainties, which are themselves uncertainto a degree, would change the decisions made in this rulemaking. For amore complete discussion of uncertainty, see chapter 7, Volume 1 of theEIS.<T3>SAB comment: </T3>Make environmental transport models state-of-the-art.<T3>EPA response: </T3>The task group identified above will oversee theupdating of risk assessment models for radionuclides. However, the SAB'srecommendations to improve environmental transport models involve modificationsof second order pathways, such as adding ingestion of contaminated soilsby cattle to the existing ingestion pathways of cattle, correcting forthe short range effect of the presence of a building on the air dispersionmodel predictions of radionuclide concentrations, and using seasonal parametersto describe agricultural practices instead of yearly averages.While EPA acknowledges the desirability of making such improvements, webelieve that the results of implementing these recommendations would makeonly minor changes in the estimated risks supporting this rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Decision to List Under Section 112</ITAG>Section 122(a) of the CAA required EPA to make a determination of whetheror not ``emissions of radioactive pollutants * * * will cause, or contributeto, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger publichealth.'' Once an affirmative determination is made, that section requiresEPA to either list the substance under section 108(a)(1), governing NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), 111(b)(1)(A), governing New SourcePerformance Standards, or 112(b)(1)(A), governing NESHAPs. EPA analyzednumerous studies which indicated that exposure to radionuclides can causethree major types of health effects: Cancer, genetic damage, and developmentaleffects. After considering these health effects, EPA made the determinationthat radionuclides cause or contribute to air pollution which ``may reasonablybe anticipated to endanger public health.'' Because EPA intended to regulatecarcinogens under section 112, it listed radionuclides under section 112(b)(1)(A)[44 FR 76738 (Dec. 27, 1979)]. That decision was the first step in theregulatory process, and was challenged in the current litigation. As aresult, EPA has reevaluated the decision and determined that the originallisting under section 112 was correct. This discussion explains that decisionto the public and provides an additional opportunity for comment on thisissue.The first part of the listing decision, the ``hazardousness'' of radionuclides,is unchallenged. The evidence that radionuclides can cause cancer has,if anything, increased since 1979, see Volume 1 of the BID. The evidencenow points to the conclusion that radiation is even more dangerous thanwas believed at that time. While some people have expressed the view that,even though radiation can cause cancer, the amount of radionuclides thatare released from a given source or industry is insignificant and to notpresent a risk. EPA believes that the results of the risk assessments demonstratethe risk to public health that results from radionuclide emissions fromindustrial sources. These risk assessments support the listing decision.Section 112(b)(1)(A) applies not merely to any ``air pollutant'' as dosections 108 and 111, but to a ``hazardous air pollutant'' that is definedas a pollutant that ``causes or contributes to air pollution which mayreasonably be anticipated to result in an increase in mortality or an increasein serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness.'' Once apollutant is determined to be a hazardous air pollutant, the only remainingstep is for the Administrator to determine whether emissions of the pollutantpresent a risk warranting regulation under section 112_that is, whetherit is a hazardous air pollutant ``for which he intends to establish anemission standard'' under that section. EPA has determined that radionuclidesnot only pose a risk of carcinogenicity and mutagenicity when emitted intothe air (see, National Academy of Sciences, Commission on Biological Effectsof Ionizing Radiation, Reports Number 3 and 4), but also are emitted insufficient quantities as to create a risk warranting regulation under section112. Therefore, EPA reaffirms its prior conclusion that radionuclides shouldbe listed for regulation under section 112.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. EPA NESHAPs Policy</ITAG>A. Legal Framework Under Vinyl Chloride<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>Under the Congressional mandate of Section 112 of the Clean Air Act, EPAmust promulgate NESHAPs that provide ``an ample margin of safety'' ``toprotect the public health.'' The recent <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>decision defines this language as having two stagesof analysis. First, EPA must make an initial determination of what is safe,based exclusively on risk to health. Second, the level may be adjusteddownward in order to provide a greater degree of safety. The second stepprovides the ``ample margin'' of safety.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. ``Safe'' or ``Acceptable'' Level</ITAG>The court in <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>explicitly declined to determine what risk levelis safe or acceptable (the court used these terms interchangeably) or toset out the method for determining this level. The court recognized thatscientific uncertainty concerning the effects of a particular carcinogenicpollutant is a matter for the Administrator's discretion under section112. ``EPA, not the court, has the technical expertise to decide what inferencesmay be drawn from the characteristics of * * * substances and to formulatepolicy with respect to what risks are acceptable.'' <T3>Id., </T3>at 1163, <T3>citing, </T3>Environmental Defense Fund v. EPA, 598 F. 2d, 83-84 (DCCir. 1978). But the Administrator may not consider other factors, suchas cost or technological feasibility in making the ``safe'' determination.The court did, however, provide some guidance on making the ``safe'' determination.The court stated that the Administrator must base the ``safe'' decisionon ``an expert judgment'' concerning ``the level of emissions that willresult in an `acceptable' risk to health.'' <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>, at 1164-65. To exercise this judgment, ``the Administratormust determine what influences should be drawn from available scientificdata and decide what risks are acceptable in the world in which we live.''<T3>Id. </T3>at 1165. The court emphasized that ``safe'' does not requireelimination of all risk. ``There are many activities that we engage inevery day_such as driving a care or even breathing city air_that entailsome risk of accident or material health impairment; nevertheless, fewpeople would consider those activities `unsafe.' '' <T3>Id., citing, Industrial Union Dep't., AFL-CIO v. American PetroleumInst.</T3>, 448 U.S. 607,642 (1980) (OSHA Benzene Case)<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Ample Margin of Safety</ITAG>Because the determination in the first stage of analysis of what is ``safe''is marked by scientific uncertainty, and safe does not mean risk free,the Administrator may set the level below that which is determined to besafe in order to achieve an ``ample margin of safety.'' Once ``safety''is assured with regard only to risk to health, the Administrator may considercost and technological feasibility in lowering the level. ``Because considerationof these factors at this stage is clearly intended to protect the publichealth, it is fully consistent with the Administrator's mandate under section112.'' <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3>, at 1165.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Uniqueness of Decision</ITAG>The effect of <T3>Vinyl Chloride </T3>is to require a unique decisionmaking process forpublic health protection decisions, unlike any other regulatory decisionfaced by the Agency. This is the result of the court's prescription oftwo separate steps for decisionmaking, the first, in which only healthfactors can be considered in setting an acceptable risk level, and thesecond, in which additional factors including cost, technological feasibility,and other relevant factors may be considered in providing an ample marginof safety. This scheme is unlike any other in the Clean Air Act or anyof the other statutes administered by EPA because the acceptable risk thatEPA adopts in the first step cannot be exceeded by the standard EPA adoptsin the second step.In contrast, other EPA statutes have very different structures and legalrequirements for decisionmaking on public health standards. For example,while the Safe Drinking Water Act provides for two separate decisions,the first is a health-based goal toward which to work, but not necessarilymeet; the second is an enforceable standard that takes cost and feasibilityinto account. Under both the toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) and theFederal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA), the balancingof health concerns and benefits of continued chemical use and control costsare explicitly provided for within a single decision. RCRA and the ComprehensiveEnvironmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) both requirestatutory decisionmaking very different from the bifurcated process mandatedby the Court for section 112. Thus, the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> decision requires EPA to consider whether a riskis acceptable without at the same time considering benefits of the activitycausing risk, feasiblity of control, or other factors. This problem isparticularly acute in the case of carcinogens, for which the Agency hasstated that it is unable to identify a threshold no-effect level. The very examples cited by the Court bring home the unusual nature of theCourt's ``acceptable risk'' decision step. The court (quoting the SupremeCourt's decision in the OSHA Benzene Case) cited ``driving a car or evenbreathing city air'' as activities that ``few people would consider * ** `unsafe.' '' But driving a car entails risks that most people would considerhigh; the annual incidence approximates 50,000 fatal accidents, and theaverage individual risk (not the maximum, but the actuarial average risk)approximates a 1 in 100 chance of automobile-related death over a 70-yearlifetime. Yet the Court was correct to say that our society accepts (ortolerates) the risk from driving cars. As a society, we continue to tryto reduce the level of risk, but we accept it due to the value of the benefitsin increased mobility that the automobile affords. The same is true of``breathing city air.'' Individuals live in cities to be close to the workplace,for the recreational and cultural advantages associated with cities, andfor a variety of reasons extrinsic to the risk itself. Commentors have often suggested that EPA consider a cost-benefit analysisin assessing risk acceptability. The court has rejected this approach.How, then, is EPA to make those judgments? Later in this section, EPA setsout for public comment four approaches that deal with this issue. The approachescover a range of possible risk levels, and they give prominence to differentmeasures of risk, e.g., individual versus population risk. B. Survey of Societal Risk The question of what constitutes ``safe'' must be answered with referenceto the ``risks that are acceptable in the world in which we live.'' <T3>Vinyl Chloride, </T3>824 F.2d at 1165. In approaching the question of what level of risk is ``acceptable'' or``safe'', EPA surveyed a range of health risks that our society faces.The objective of this survey was to develop information to place the radionucliderisk estimates in perspective. Thus, the risks examined included thoseencountered in everyday life, such as driving a car and breathing cityair, which were cited in the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> decision, as well as a range of regulatory judgmentsor risks. The EPA surveyed both the individual risk and the incidence inthe population exposed to risk associated with the activities. Consideringincidence comports with the purpose of section 112 to protect ``publichealth'' when incidence is viewed as a measure of health of the populationas a whole. The risks examined ranged from individual risks of 1 to 10 (10^1) to lessthan 1 in 10,000,000 (10^7). Everyday risks include risks from naturalbackground radiation as well as risks from home accidents. Natural backgroundradiation (excluding radon) at sea level creates individual lifetime cancerrisks in the range of 3 in 1,000 (3andmultiply;10^3) and an estimated 10,000cancer cases per year. Naturally occurring radon in homes poses an additionalsource of radiation risk, and these risks can be as high as 1 in 100 to1 in 10 (10^2 to 10^1) and cause an estimated 5,000 to 20,000 cancer casesper year. In the U.S., accidents, natural disasters, and rare diseasespose individual risks of death from 1 in 10,000 (10^4) (e.g., trippingand falling which cause approximately 470 deaths per year) to 1 in 10,000,000(10^7) (e.g., rabies which causes an average of 1.5 deaths per year).Judgments on risks have also spanned a broad range of risk levels. TheNCRP, following recommendations of the International Commission on RadiologicalProtection, has recommended that maximum individual exposures from non-medicalmanmade radiation be limited to an amount corresponding to risks of 3 in1,000 (3 andmultiply; 10^3). See Table 3 for a comparison of radiologicalrisks and recommendations. It is important to note that the recommendationsof national and international bodies shown in table 3 are coupled withrecommendations that radiation doses should be ``as low as reasonably achievable''(ALARA). The implementation of ALARA requires a site-specific considerationof the cost effectiveness of controls that could be added to reduce radiationdoses. Therefore, these national and internationally recommended dose levelsare acceptable only when the ALARA principle has also been satisfied.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) establishes tolerances for poisonousor deleterious substances, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), ata level found necessary to protect the public health, taking into accountthe extent to which the substance is unavoidable in the food supply andthe other ways the consumer may be affected by the same substance. Forexample, FDA has established a tolerance level for PCBs in fish at an individualrisk of 7 andmultiply; 10^5, which could result in 34 cancer cases each yearamong heavy fish consumers alone (44 FR 38333, June 29, 1979). The EPA regulates pesticide uses under FIFRA based on whether the pesticidecreates unreasonable adverse effects, a statutory term defined as requiringthe balancing of risks and benefits. The EPA has authorized some uses ofthe pesticide chlorobenzilate that would create individual risk of 1 andmultiply;10^6 to 7 andmultiply; 10^6 and could result in 2 to 9 additional cancercases per year (EPA banned other uses of this pesticide). Regulatory judgments have also been made to require lower risks. For example,under the provisions of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which povidesthat ``no residue'' from carcinogenic additives to animal feed may remainin any edible portion of the animal, FDA has established a policy of notallowing the use of additives that create a risk higher than 1 in 1,000,0001 andmultiply; 10^6. A complete description of the risks EPA considered ispresented in a document in the docket entitled ``Survey of Risks.'' No fixed risk level could be identified as acceptable in all cases andunder all regulatory programs for two main reasons. First, as discussedabove, in most cases the calculation or risks depends on different data,assumptions, and uncertainties. For example, the risk associated with motorvehicle and other common accidents can be calculated directly from accidentrecords and therefore reflects actual risk, whereas environmental risksare based on estimating procedures and assumptions and therefore are moreuncertain. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>3._<T4>Radiological Risks Compared</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Annual effective dose equivalent (mrem)</H1><H1>Lifetime risk</H1><T4>Regulatory Risk</T4><ITAG tagnum="2">Federal guidance \3\ (1960) (individual, long-term) <D>500 </D><D>1.5andmultiply;10</D>^2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">ICRP advisory \1\\3\ (1987) (all sources) <D>100 </D><D>3andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NCRP advisory \2\\3\ (1985) (all sources) <D>100 </D><D>3andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">British advisory \3\ (1987) (all sources) <D>50 </D><D>1.5andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NCRP advisory \2\ \3\ (1984) (air sources) <D>25 </D><D>7andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">NRC goal for nuclear power plants \3\ (current) <D>5 </D><D>1.5andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">EPA drinking water standards (1976) <D>4 </D><D>1.2andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG><T4>Background Risk</T4><ITAG tagnum="2">Natural background (total) <D>300 </D><D>1andmultiply;10</D>^2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Natural background (total non-radon) <D>100 </D><D>3andmultiply;10</D>^3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Yearly round trip flight N.Y. to L.A.

Second, the acceptability of risk isa relative concept and involves consideration of different factors. Considerationsin these judgments may include: The certainty and severity of the risk;the reversibility of the health effect; the knowledge or familiarity ofthe risk; whether the risk is voluntarily imposed or whether the individualreceives a direct benefit for accepting the risk voluntarily; the advantagesof the activity; and the risk and advantages for any alternatives. Thus,different <T3>judgments </T3>on acceptability can be made for similar numerical estimatesof risks.In addition, the uses of individual risk and incidence as comparative factorsface limitations since the relative size of the risks associated with anactivity determine how the activity is defined. For example, incidenceassociated with a single leaking pipe at a plant within a particular industrycould be quite small, but the cumulative risks associated with all plantswithin the industry could be significant. This limitation can be amelioratedby careful selection of the appropriate categories of sources.In summary, EPA surveyed and considered this risk information to provideperspective on society's consideration and acceptance of risk. In its consideration,EPA is not judging whether each of the risks presented here is acceptableor unacceptable. They are presented, instead, to provide a context forevaluating the relative public health implications of a range of activitiesand the risk present in activities being considered for regulation undersection 112.C. General NESHAP Policy ConsiderationsThe purpose of this section is to discuss and solicit comment on the appropriatecriteria for determining an ``acceptable risk'' and an ``ample margin ofsafety.'' In its determination, EPA will consider measures of health risk,and limitations and uncertainties of the risk estimation methods and basicdata. A discussion of these factors follows, as well as a discussion ofthe four approaches to making the acceptable risk decision. Comments aresolicited on all aspects of the discussion and the four approaches. Theframework adopted in this proceeding has already been proposed in the BenzeneNESHAP and may also become the policies for decisions on future NESHAPsbut will not apply to other Agency programs or other sections of the CleanAir Act.The main purpose of the discussion presented here is to provide a basisfor comment on the major policy issues raised by the Court's opinion, inparticular, on the requirement that in regulating air toxics under section112 the Agency must decide what risk is acceptable in ``the world in whichwe live.'' In the months since the Court's decision, issues about acceptabilityof risk from air toxics have been the subject of discussion both withinthe Agency and in public debate. The four alternative policy approachesoutlined address the acceptable risk decision in different ways. The basicquestions to be answered in each approach are: What measure or measuresof risk should be given weight in the acceptable risk decision? Are therespecific levels of individual or population risk that are acceptable? Howshould EPA balance individual, population risk and risk distribution? Shouldthe same levels be set and the same measures applied for all NESHAPs? Howshould uncertainty in risk estimation be considered?The approaches described include one in which all risk information andmeasures available as well as estimation limitations and uncertaintiesare considered in determining acceptable risk on a case-by-case basis.Other approaches simply apply one quantitative risk parameter, either riskto the maximally exposed individual or aggregate risk of increased fatalcancer in the population (population risk). The approaches also vary inthe level of risk that would be acceptable. The details of the resultsof applying each of the approaches to radionuclide source categories aredescribed later in this preamble.Three of the approaches use either maximum individual risk or populationrisk as the sole criterion for acceptable risk. Some take the view thatadded cancer risk to the individual is the most, or only important measure.Two of the approaches use this as the only criterion for acceptable risk.The third approach uses incidence as the only criterion for acceptablerisk. Arguments in favor of the individual risk measure are that no individualshould be at high risk, that considering the number of people at risk leadsto acceptance of higher individual risk when few people are exposed, andthat it is inequitable for acceptable risk to an individual to depend uponthe number of people similarly exposed. Arguments favoring use of addedincidence are that it is an appropriate measure of total public healthimpact and this total risk to the population is a good indicator of acceptablerisk.On the other hand, fatal cancer is only one of a number of possible healtheffects and thus may not accurately measure the total health impact nortotal population risk.Uncertainty of risk estimates is also dealt with differently by the alternativeapproaches. Under Approach A, the case-by-case approach, all risk factorsincluding estimation uncertainties are considered in the acceptable riskdetermination. Approaches B, C and D use a single risk measure as the criterionfor the acceptable risk decision and thus would leave consideration ofother risk measures and specific judgments concerning much of the overalluncertainty until the second step, the ample margin of safety decision.How to weigh these uncertainties is a problem under any approach becausewhile the Agency often has quantitative estimates of uncertainty to usefor specific elements of the risk assessment, it can often only make aqualitative judgment about whether the overall uncertainty in the methodsand assumptions has resulted in a over- or underestimated risk. Commentsare solicited on the consideration of uncertainty in acceptable risk decisions.Each alternative deals similarly with the ample margin of safety decision.In each, all the health information as well as cost, technical feasibility,estimation uncertainties and other relevant factors would be considered.Comment is requested on five issues in particular. First, is the amplemargin of safety step more suitable than the acceptable risk step to takeinto account (usually qualitatively) the direction and extent of estimationuncertainties? Second, should all technically feasible and affordable controlsbe required without regard to whether any significant risk reduction isassociated with the control? Third, should the Agency adopt a policy ofusing the ample margin step to force the development of new technologyto reduce risk? Fourth, how should EPA balance the various risk, technical,and economic considerations in ample margin of safety decisions? Fifth,what criteria should EPA use to define the ``availability'' and ``feasibility''of technological controls?The remainder of this section describes several risk measures, how theyare derived, general questions regarding control technology, and the fouralternative regulatory approaches. The approaches are considered from theperspective of application to the radionuclide source categories coveredin today's notice and to the NESHAP program.D. Risk Measures Considered in NESHAP Policy Approaches In decisions on cancer risks from stationary sources of hazardous air pollutants,the Agency has estimated three measures of health risk. These are termed``maximum individual risk,'' ``risk distribution,'' and ``incidence''.Each of these combines an estimate of the dose/response for a pollutantwith estimates of exposure to the pollutant. The response estimated isthe pollutant-related increase in the probability that an individual willcontract fatal cancer in his or her lifetime. The exposure estimated isthe average daily exposure assuming exposure for 70 years. <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Maximum Individual Risk </ITAG>Individual risk is expressed as an estimated probability, e.g., 1 in 100(10^2), 1 in 1,000 (10^3), 1 in 10,000 (10^4). Thus a 1andmultiply;10^3 individualrisk is an added ``chance'' of 1 in 1,000 of contracting fatal cancer sometimein the individual's lifetime.  In this discussion, the maximum individual lifetime risk is the additionalcancer risk of a person due to exposure for 70-year lifetime at a pointof maximum concentration of an emitted pollutant. The maximum individualrisk is sometimes called the maximum exposed individual risk. This estimateis based on the fact that the concentration of an emission, and the consequentrisk, diminishes with distance from its source. For NESHAP decisions, thepractice has been to estimate this figure for the largest annual averagepollutant concentration to which any member of the public may be subjectaccording to census data on residence locations. It has also been estimatedin some other Agency decisions as the maximum at the source perimeter.The maximum individual lifetime risk is different from average individualrisk which is sometimes estimated for sources like public drinking watersystems or food in which the concentration of a pollutant and other factorsare assumed to be equal at all distribution locations. This distinctionis particularly relevant when considering the maximum risk one might findacceptable from different sources. In using the maximum individual riskin acceptable risk decisions for hazardous air pollutants, its limitationsshould be considered. Used alone, the measure does not tell how many peoplemay be so affected; it relates only to the risk to the most exposed individual(s).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Risk Distribution </ITAG>A risk distribution estimates how many persons within a certain distance(e.g. 80 km) of a source of pollutant emissions are at what level of individualrisk. Typically, the distribution is given for 10-fold increments of individualrisk. Such a distribution provides the decisionmaker with information onboth the individual risk level for those exposed and the number of personsexposed at each level. For NESHAP and other decisions, the Agency has examinedrisk distributions both as measures of risk and to compare the effectsof various strategies for risk reductions across a source category. In making an acceptable risk decision, one relevant consideration is howmany people are exposed at each risk level, e.g. a (10^2) risk might beacceptable if only one person were at that level, but not if 1,000 peoplewere subject to it. Similarly, the number of persons exposed at variousindividual risk levels could be an important element in deciding on acceptablerisk. The risk distribution could be used in similar ways to consider whetheran ample margin of safety exists. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Incidence  </ITAG>Incidence is an estimate of population, rather than individual, risk. Itis derived by multiplying individual risk by the estimate of the numberof persons at that level of risk and summing the results over all risklevels. This number, which provides a lifetime population risk figure,is then divided by 70 (years) to give an annual fatal cancer incidenceestimate. The incidence parameter can be used as an estimate of impacton the entire exposed population within a given area by totalling the incidenceassociated with each increment of individual risk. Incidence can also beportrayed along with individual risk and population numbers in a risk distribution.Typically, the Agency weighs incidence estimates in conjunction with maximumindividual risk or average individual risk estimates. Estimated incidencegenerally is a particularly informative parameter when looking at aggregaterisk from a category of like sources. One feature to take into accountwhenever it is used is its dependence on the size of the source category.E. Uncertainties in Risk Measures. Each of the three risk parameters defined above has three elements. Theseare the estimated response per unit of pollutant concentration (e.g. pCi/1in air), the estimated exposure concentration, and the estimation of thenumber and location of the population residing in the area of the sources(usually taken from census data). Uncertainties exist in estimating each of these elements for a varietyof reasons including the fact that the relevant data and our understandingof the biological events involved are not complete. Where data gaps exist,qualitative and quantitative assumptions are made based on our presentunderstanding of the biological mechanisms of cancer causation, estimatesof air dispersion, engineering estimates, and other factors. Selectionof certain assumptions to be used is a policy decision. The Agency haspublished guidelines covering many of these for both cancer risk assessmentand exposure assessment. [``Final Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment,''51 FR 33992 (September 24, 1986) and ``Final Guidelines for EstimatingExposures,'' 51 FR 33042 (September 24, 1986)]. The following is a discussion of methods used to calculate the three parameters,together with a few examples of the uncertainties.  Risk assessment, under EPA guidelines, takes into account the nature andamount of evidence that the agent will cause the effect of concern in humansas well as the uncertainties of interpretation of data and its quantification.When the toxicity data from human studies are available, as in the caseof radionuclides (which is a known carcinogen), there is less uncertaintyabout the hazard of dose/response than when the data is solely from animalstudies. Nevertheless, important uncertainties enter into the analysiseven when human data is available. Examples include the fact that humanepidemiological studies are often retrospective and measure effects ofexposure that occurred many years in the past. The level of exposure tothe agent at that time usually must be estimated and cannot be verified.Also, in certain categories of human studies, the studies are often ofworkers exposed to the pollutant. Worker populations are not representativeof the general population with respect to age or sex. Workers are alsogenerally the healthier segment of the population. These factors can leadto over- or underestimation of risk.  When data from animal studies are used, uncertainties about exposure canbe experimentally controlled, but other uncertainties arise. Many of theseconcern the extrapolation from data collected in animal tests to estimateeffects on humans. The extrapolation has to try to account for many factors,such as the equivalent dose for humans and laboratory animals given thesize differences and the potential differences in metabolism and excretionof a chemical pollutant.In addition, uncertainties arise in extrapolating the observed dose/responserelationship from either workplace or animal test exposures to the usuallylower dose levels of the general population.In estimating exposure, the dispersion of a pollutant from a source isusually quantified by a predictive mathematical model using a known ormodel source emission rate, temperature and velocity characteristics, andweather patterns at nearby stability array (STAR) stations, typically thenearest recording weather station. The model predicts the concentrationof the dispersed pollutant at various distances from the source. Standardassumptions are that the population around the source resides there fora 70-year lifetime and is continuously exposed to the modeled concentrations.The amount of emissions can be derived from sampling and analysis of emissionsat the source or from engineering estimates, with more or less uncertaintyassociated with each method according to the type of emission. There arevarying degrees of accuracy and precision in sampling, analysis, or estimatesof emissions. Therefore the uncertainties involved in the method of estimatingindividual exposure and the number of individuals exposed are numerous.Thus, it is evident that uncertainty is difficult to quantify. Questionsrelevant to two-step decisionmaking under the <T3>Vinyl Chloride</T3> opinion are: At which step or steps should uncertaintybe accounted for? How should uncertainty be considered if it cannot bequantified?F. Technology Availability and Plant Closure ConsiderationsIn the proposed benzene NESHAP, as well as in this NESHAP for radionuclides,EPA has considered only factors relating to risks to public health in derivingalternative ``acceptable'' levels of risk. However, in evaluating whetherto further reduce the risk to provide for an ample margin of safety, EPAhas also considered the extent to which plants would be forced to: (a)Install control technologies which are not cost effective or fully demonstratedand/or (b) curtail or stop production. These considerations are reflectedin today's proposal to the extent that they apply to affected radionuclidesources.With regard to the availability of technology to control air pollutants,EPA has in this case considered a technology available if it has been installedon a commercial scale in the United States and adequate data have beencollected on plant and control equipment characteristics and performance.However, at various times in the past, EPA has considered emission standardswhich force plants to install technologies which do not meet these current``availability'' criteria or cause facilities to curtail production orshut down. For example, EPA has in the past considered a technology ``available''if it has been commercially demonstrated in other countries, even if nounits have been installed in the United States. Also, EPA has consideredbench- or pilot-scale demonstrations in order to judge reasonableness ofexpenditures for commercial demonstration of a given technology. Othershave argued that EPA should not be concerned about the extent to whichtechnologies are ``available'' since the standards should be solely basedon public health considerations. Proponents of this latter view argue thatthe health-based standards will themselves provide adequate incentive forcurrently high risk industries to develop new control technologies. Stillothers argue that the compliance schedules in section 112 will cause sourcesto close rather than undertake the risk of installing costly technologythat is unproven.The EPA solicits public comment on the relative merits of alternative criteriafor determining the availability of technology and on the question of appropriatealternative methods for encouraging development of alternative technologies,processes, product substitutes, and/or lifestyle changes.G. Description of Alternative Policy ApproachesEach of the four approaches described here for comment treat the ``acceptablerisk'' decision differently. The first approach considers all risk factorsin the ``acceptable'' decision and then considers all risk factors pluscost and feasibility of emission controls in the ``ample margin of safety''decision. The other three approaches differ from the first in that theyuse a single parameter, maximum individual lifetime risk or incidence,as the sole deciding factor for acceptable risk, while considering otherfactors in the ``ample margin'' decision.The case-by-case and single parameter approaches differ in the degree towhich they possess each of two desirable features. One feature is the abilityof the Agency to consider the weight of evidence, or confidence, in thehazard data from which risk numbers are derived and the confidence in theemission and exposure estimates. The second feature is the degree to whichdecisions are clear and understandable, and thus can be perceived by thepublic as consistent.The case-by-case approach is designed to bring all of the evidence to bearin association with risk numbers at both decision steps. The Agency hasadopted the policy of risk assessment contained in the 1983 study by theNational Academy of Sciences entitled ``Risk Assessment in the FederalGovernment Managing the Process'' (National Academy Press). This studycovers the various elements of cancer risk assessment and the assumptionsand uncertainties it involves.One of the policies emphasized in the report and adopted by EPA is to givethe risk manager a risk characterization which contains the informationneeded for a decision on how much confidence to place on numbers. For example,numbers for risk estimates for two different pollutants might look thesame, but be based on data sets of quite different quality. A very largeset of data from human and animal studies could be the foundation for ahigh degree of certainty in deriving a quantitative dose/response relationship.On the other hand, a quantitative dose/response estimate based on lessevidence could be more uncertain. Moreover, emission estimates and exposuremodeling may be based on site-specific information, assumptions, or combinationsof the two. Depending on the data and assumptions, there can be large differencesin the confidence of the exposure estimates. EPA has used a variety ofdata in this rulemaking and has confidence in the data used for the purposesof this rulemaking. However, a risk manager would be justified in usingtwo kinds of estimates differently in decisionmaking, in spite of the factthat the numbers might be very similar.An advantage of the case-by-case approach is that it uses the full rangeof evidence behind the risk numbers in determining acceptable risk andin deciding on an ample margin of safety. A disadvantage of this approachis that it relies on case-by-case interpretation and judgment of data,which can make the basis for the decision more difficult for the publicto understand. In addition, decisions may appear inconsistent when differentnumerical risks are judged to be acceptable in different cases.The single measure approaches takes risk numbers at face value for theacceptable risk decision, with a fuller consideration of the weight ofall evidence at the margin of safety step. The advantages of these approachesare their clarity and ease of administration, which are good bases foradoption of such an approach. Their disadvantage is that they do not considerall of the risk factors, risk characterization, and uncertainties in theinitial step.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach A. Case-by-Case Approach</ITAG>Under this approach, the Administrator makes decisions on what is an acceptablerisk on a case-by-case basis. The Administrator considers individual risk,risk distribution and incidence, their estimation limitations and uncertaintiesin judging which levels of emissions present acceptable risks to publichealth for each of the sources considered. This approach recognizes thatthe risk to public health is a combination of these factors, and, therefore,the level of acceptable risk to the public health varies among the differentsources.In applying Approach A, the approach is to examine the risk distributionand to consider maximum individual risks around 101^\4\ or less to be thepreferred range. The 101^\4\ level was selected for reasons analogous toits use in Approach C (see discussion of Approach C for further explanation).Under all Approach A decisions, however, the Agency will closely examinethe aggravating and mitigating factors associated with the risk estimates.Included in this examination is recognition that there are considerableuncertainties in the risk characterization, emission, estimates, and exposureassumptions; these uncertainties may very widely among assessment. Acceptabilityof higher risks includes consideration of the number of people at thatrisk and the total incidence. Greater weight is given to the incidenceassociated with individual risks greater than 101^\5\, this is becauserisks lower than this are generally considered small. In addition, boththe dose/response and exposure estimates increase in uncertainty at theselower levels, which generally represent large extrapolations from highto low doses and dispersion of the pollutant at greater distance from thesource, respectively. Risks greater than the 101^\4\ or less preferredrange may be judged acceptable in this approach when all factors are considered.Examples of circumstances that EPA believes appropriate to consider include:(1) The uncertainties of the analysis; (2) the degree of over or underestimation in the risk characterization; (3) the weight of evidence ofthe health effects and non-quantified health effects, (4) modeled versusmeasured exposures, and; (5) the estimated population predicted at lifetimerisk of around 1 in 10,000 or greater.It should be recognized that zero risk is unattainable. This approach providesa mechanism to reasonably consider various health risks or other healthrelated factors that are appropriate to each source category.EPA has also considered the health risk due to the level of natural backgroundradiation. In the case of radionuclides, the background levels cause higherindividual and population risks than any of the source categories beingconsidered for regulation in this rulemaking.The highest level of emissions that is considered in the acceptable riskstep is the baseline level of emissions. Alternatives other than baselineemissions are developed to give the Administrator reasonable alternativeswith specific quantitative benefits to choose from. In reality, the conceptsof acceptable risk and ample margin of safety exist on a continuum andare not easily quantified.Decisions on acceptable risk are premised on the highest associated riskthat was judged acceptable after weighing the many different considerationsappropriate for that source category. Clearly all the alternatives forthat source category that present smaller risks are also acceptable. Anyalternative that is higher than the chosen alternative for that case allowsrisks that are unacceptable. However, that does not mean that any riskthat is even slightly higher than the chosen alternative is inherentlyunacceptable. In order to develop standards, discrete alternatives areselected and discrete lines are drawn. <ITAG tagnum="81">Approach B. Incidence-Based Approach</ITAG>In this approach, incidence is the only parameter used to decide acceptabilityof risk. At the ``ample margin of safety'' step, all of the risk parametersas well as estimation uncertainties, cost, and feasibility are considered.The annual incidence proposed as acceptable is no more than 1 death/yrper source category. The EPA is proposing an incidence number of 1 percategory because it is felt that one was small compared to the total numberof cancer deaths each year and in relation to incidence associated withrisks from numerous everyday activities. Comment is requested on the appropriatenessof this selection.Approach B relies on incidence. An advantage of an incidence-based approachis that while incidence and maximum individual lifetime risk are uncertainfigures, in general, incidence figures are likely to be more accurate thanmaximum individual lifetime risk figures. A maximum individual lifetimerisk estimate is much more sensitive to errors in modeling assumptionsin the exposure estimate. When those uncertainties are spread throughoutthe exposed population in an incidence estimate, they tend to average outand thus to yield results that are less uncertain.One feature to note is that since no other criterion besides incidenceplays a role in the acceptable risk decision, high maximum individual risklevels would be acceptable so long as the exposed population is sufficientlysmall that the incidence level is met.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach C. 1x10</ITAG>1^\4\ or less Maximum Individual Risk ApproachThis approach would use maximum individual risk as the sole criterion fordeciding acceptable risk. At the ample margin of safety step, the riskdistribution and incidence would be added to the factors considered aswell as uncertainty, cost and feasibility.The acceptable risk level for maximum individual risk under this approachis 1x101^\4\ or less. This approach focuses on the estimation of the maximumconcentration to which anyone could be exposed, which is used to calculatethe maximum individual risk. Approach C's acceptable risk is defined as1x101^\4\ maximum individual risk. This level is analogous to the top ofthe target individual risk range used in some other EPA programs. A riskof 101^\4\ falls roughly in the middle of the range of risks consideredin the survey of societal risks, discussed earlier in this section. Anadvantage of using the single parameter of individual risk is that it issimple and clear cut. The level chosen is low enough to assure that therisk to the public health is acceptable. One disadvantage of Option C isthat without the additional perspective of the risk distribution and incidenceestimates and all other risk information, many decisions would ride exclusivelyon the uncertain prediction of the concentration and location of the areaof maximum exposure. The accuracy of emission factors, meteorological data,and census data for specific source locations are among the more uncertainestimates, but would be the most critical elements under this decision.However, at the ample margin of safety step, the other risk measure couldbe examined to bring the needed perspective to the overall decision.<ITAG tagnum="81">Approach D. 1x10</ITAG>1^\6\ or Less Maximum Individual Risk ApproachThis approach is identical to Approach C except that it uses a more stringentcriterion for individual risk. The acceptable risk is defined as 1x101^\6\maximum individual risk. This level is proposed on the theory that risksbelow this level have been generally regarded as small additions to anindividual lifetime risk or cancer considering the risks faced by backgroundradiation. Additionally, the 101^\6\ level falls near the lower end ofthe risk range in the survey of risks, discussed earlier in this section.Based on current information, EPA is unable to accurately quantify theeffects resulting from the implementation of Approach D. We are interestedin receiving comments concerning the effects of such action.H. Format of StandardsThe format of the standards proposed for the various source categoriesvary because of the differing technical features of the sources. For example,area sources emitting radon are best monitored by flux measurements. Thus,flux standards are most appropriate. Similarly, mixtures of radionuclidesare best related to public health through the use of the concept of dose.We have proposed dose standards to limit emissions in those cases whereit is appropriate. Where a single radionuclide is emitted or a single radionuclideemission limit would serve to limit all others, we have proposed an emissionlimit for that radionuclide. Where no form of emission limit is possible,we resort to work practice standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Discussion of Source Categories</ITAG>The regulatory decisions proposed today are based on the risk assessmentsand other factors available in the current rulemaking record. This proposalmay provide EPA with additional risk analyses or other information relevantto these decisions. Consequently, based on such information the Administratormay choose to reach a different regulatory decision in the final rule forsome or all the source categories addressed in the rulemaking.A. Department of Energy Facilities<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>The DOE administers many facilities, including government-owned, contractor-operatedfacilities across the country. Some facilities conduct nuclear energy andweapons research and development, some enrich uranium and produce plutoniumfor nuclear weapons and reactors, and some process, store and dispose ofradioactive wastes. These facilities contain significant amounts of radioactivematerial and emit radionuclides into the air. Other facilities containlarge stockpiles of byproduct material which emit large quantities of radon.A discussion of DOE facilities in this category appears as a separate sectionlater in this Preamble. EPA is considering the two categories separatelyin this rulemaking because of the imprecision of converting radon measurementsinto dose standards. In addition, the two categories employ different controlmethods.Some of the DOE facilities emitting radionuclides are on large sites coveringhundreds of square miles in remote locations. Some of the smaller sitesresemble typical industrial facilities and are located in suburban areas.In total, DOE has almost 100 sites that emit radionuclides. These facilitiesemit a wide variety of radionuclides in various physical and chemical states.Emissions from various DOE facilities represent many types of radionuclidesand both internal and external dose pathways (although specific facilitiesmay emit only one or two radionuclides affecting only one pathway).DOE facilities are presently covered by a radionuclide NESHAP which limitsemissions such that no individual receives  a  whole  body  dose  of  25 mrem/y  or  receives  a  dose  of  75  mrem/y to any organ. DOE also controlsreleases from these facilities under DOE orders which limit calculateddoses to the general public to be less than 100 mrem/y from all sourcesand pathways. By incorporating the ALARA concept into its Orders, DOE haskept the dose to the public well below 100 mrem/y. The NESHAP also mandatesthat DOE send annual reports of emissions to EPA. The information gatheredfrom these reports contributed to EPA's risk assessment of DOE facilities.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of DOE facilities is a site-by-site assessment. Emissionsare based on DOE's 1986 report of emissions, meteorological data is takenfrom nearby weather stations, and population distributions within 80 kmare based on U.S. census tract data. EPA has a high degree of confidencein the results of this risk assessment.According to EPA's analysis, all DOE facilities are in compliance withthe current NESHAP. The risk to the most exposed individual is approximately1.2andmultiply;10^4. DOE facilities are estimated to cause 0.17 fatal cancersper year to the exposed populations within 80 km of all DOE facilities.Most of the exposed population has a lifetime fatal cancer risk of lessthan 1andmultiply;10^6.Table 4 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level.

The estimated annual incidence is 0.17fatal cancers per year. Most DOE facilities have much smaller emissionsthan that causing the highest individual risk and do not contribute significantlyto the total risk from the entire category. In addition, DOE has reducedthe emissions from its facilities over the last few years and is continuingto do so.EPA examined several alternatives before determining the acceptable level.Those alternatives and the risks they present are illustrated in Table4.

Introduction. </T3>ORP's experience in implementing the existingradionuclide NESHAP covering DOE facilities has shown that implementationof the current standard has several problems. EPA is proposing a new systemfor implementing the proposed NESHAP designed to overcome some of the limitationsin the present standard. This system will be used regardless of the specificlevel of standard that is chosen.<T3>b. Yearly reports. </T3>The implementation system for the NESHAP isdesigned to provide EPA with yearly reports on the levels of emissionsfrom regulated facilities and resulting doses. Presently, DOE facilitiesmonitor their emissions and make annual reports to EPA. These reports shouldcontinue under the new NESHAP. Although the report is based on a calendaryear the dose standard applies to any year, i.e. any period of 12 consecutivemonths. Since these reports provide EPA with the information it needs,DOE facilities are exempted from the requirements of 61.10.<T3>c. Definition of a facility. </T3>A problem in implementing the currentstandard is the ambiguity associated with the present definition of a facility.All the buildings, structures and operations within one contiguous siteshall be considered a single facility. For example, the entire DOE facilityat Oak Ridge, Tennessee must meet the current standard of 25 mrem/y, insteadof each individual building getting its own 25 mrem/y standard.<T3>d. Distinction between construction and modification. </T3>Since EPAtakes the position that a facility is all the buildings within a givenplant site, there can be confusion over whether the construction of a newbuilding constitutes an existing facility, is new construction, or is amodification of an existing facility. It is proposed that the new NESHAPwill specify that the construction of a new building is new constructionat the facility and not a modification of the facility. This distinctionis important because all new construction needs to be checked to see whetheror not it needs prior approval but modifications which do not cause a netincrease in the rate of emissions from the facility do not need prior approval.<T3>e. Prior approval of new construction or modification. </T3>EPA willnot change the basic definition of modification that exists at 40 CFR 61.15.A change that causes any increase in the rate of emissions is a modification,no matter how small that increase is. To reduce unnecessary paperwork,it is appropriate to avoid applications in cases of small changes.EPA proposes a system under which DOE facilities will use AIRDOS to determinethe dose to the most exposed individual due to the modification or newconstruction. If the estimated maximum individual dose added by the newconstruction or modification is less than 1% of the standard, then themodification or new construction does not need prior approval.In making the determination of dose, for this purpose DOE must use theemission factors and source term determination from ``BID: Procedures Approvedfor Demonstrating Compliance with the Dose Limits Established by 40 CFRPart 61, subpart I.'' (BID: Compliance).B. Nuclear Regulatory Commission Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>NRC-licensed, Agreement state-licensed, and non-DOE federal facilitiesinclude over 6,000 different facilities. These facilities include researchand test reactors, hospitals, clinics, the radiopharmaceutical industry,low level nuclear waste facilities, and other research and industrial facilities.These facilities are located in all fifty states. EPA estimates that virtuallyevery American lives within 80 km of an NRC licensee.The facilities in this category emit a large number of radionuclides. Theseradionuclides affect individuals by inhalation, ingestion, ground depositionand immersion pathways. Individual facilities may emit only one or tworadionuclides affecting only one or two pathways.Emissions from this source category are presently covered by a radionuclideNESHAP which mandates that emissions do not cause any individual to receivea whole body dose of more than 25 mrem/y or receive a dose of 75 mrem/yto any organ. Two categories of NRC-licensees have been exempted from coverageby the existing NESHAP: High-level nuclear waste (HLW) facilities and uraniumfuel cycle (UFC) facilities. There are two types of HLW facilities, managementand disposal facilities. The disposal of HLW, which occurs at a few uniquefacilities, is considered as a separate source category. The management,processing and storage of HLW that occurs at a NRC-licensee is includedin the estimate of emissions of the licensee used in the analysis thatunderlies today's proposal for this category. Most of the NRC-licenseesthat manage, process or store HLW do so because it is related to theirother operations. For radionuclide NESHAPs, EPA has determined that itis impractical to separately analyze and regulate two different emissionsfrom the same facility. UFC facilities, which are distinctly differentfacilities, are being analyzed as a separate source category.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk.</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of this category combined an analysis of the ninesub-categories that make up this category. Due to the wide scope of thiscategory, EPA's risk assessment of this source category is based on largeemitters and model facilities with model populations. The assessment includedboth analysis of those facilities believed to be the largest emitters andmodel facilities within each sub-category. The estimates of maximum individualrisk are based on the site-by-site assessment of the largest known emitters.The analysis of the largest sources was based on information compiled frompreviously existing data bases and information received from some of thesources themselves. The model facilities were developed after reviewingdata from surveys conducted by the NRC and the Conference of RadiationControl Program Directors. The use of model facilities increases the uncertaintyof the risk assessment. Especially uncertain are estimates of the populationwithin given risk ranges. EPA requests that commentors provide any additionalinformation concerning emissions from this source category that might changeEPA's estimate of maximum individual risk or population incidence.The estimates of population risks are based on extrapolations from modelfacilities using census tract data. Frequency distributions do not takeinto account overlapping sources.The results of this analysis are a maximum individual risk of 1.6andmultiply;10^4.EPA estimates that this category results in 0.13 fatal cancers per year.EPA's analysis shows that less than 0.5% of the U.S. population receivesa lifetime fatal cancer risk greater than 1andmultiply;10^6. Some of thelarger NRC-licensees do release small amounts of iodine-125 and iodine-131;these radionuclides can cause thyroid cancer.Table 6 presents example scenarious to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternatives 2 and3.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI to the NRC-licensees source categoryare described below.<T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Themaximum individual risk to any individual is approximately 1.6andmultiply;10^4which is higher than the level preferred under the case-by-case approach.The estimated annual incidence is 0.13 fatal cancers per year; virtuallyall of that risk is borne by people whose risk is less than 1andmultiply;10^5,and over 80% of the risk is borne by individuals whose risk is less than10^6. Most NRC-licensees have much smaller emissions and do not contributesignificantly to the total risk.EPA examined several alternatives before determining the acceptable level.Those alternatives and the risks they present are illustrated in Table6. After examining these different options, the Administrator proposesto determine that 10 mrem/y ede, which represents the baseline, is acceptableunder the case-by-case approach. A maximum individual risk higher thanthe preferred level is acceptable in this case because only a few individualsincur this level of risk and because the risk distribution is such thatincidence is only 0.13 per year.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>6._<T4>Alternatives for Acceptable Risk From NRC Licensees</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><H1>Alternative 2</H1><H1>Alternative 3</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (lifetime)<D>1.6andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>1.0andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>3.0andmultiply;10</D>^5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km (death/y)<D>0.13</D><D>0.13</D><D>0.12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Risk individual:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>2,600</D><D>2,600</D><D>800</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>720,000</D><D>720,000</D><D>400,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>240M</D><D>240M</D><D>240M</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Risk incidence:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>(\1\)</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>0.00054</D><D>0.00054</D><D>0.00025</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>0.024</D><D>0.024</D><D>0.011</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>0.11</D><D>0.11</D><D>0.11</D><F/><T3>Other Health Impacts: </T3>Total cancers may be as much as 9 timeshigher than the number of fatal cancers because risks from some of thelargest facilities in this source category are caused predominately byiodine which causes thyroid cancer.<F>\1\ We believe there are some individuals at this risk level but all6,000 facilities in this category have not been characterized.</F></ITAG><T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>EPA has examined the controltechnology necessasry to lower emissions from NRC-licensees.

The system for implementing this NESHAP is described in``A Guide for Determining Compliance with Clean Air Act Standards for RadionuclideEmissions From NRC-Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.'' The Agencyhas also developed the COMPLY Computer Code (described earlier), for IBMand IBM-compatible computers, to assist the regulated community in determiningcompliance with the standard.<T3>b. Yearly reports. </T3>The implementation system for the NESHAP isdesigned to provide EPA with yearly reports on the levels of emissionsand the dose caused by those emissions from regulated facilities. Thereare over 6,000 NRC-licensees, many of whom have very small amounts of radionuclides.EPA considers that the emissions from most sources in this category areso low that reporting should not be necessary. EPA has developed a systemto determine whether or not reporting is required by estimating the dosecaused by a facility's emissions. As long as the dose to the maximum individualis 10% of the standard or less, then the facility does not have to report.EPA currently estimates that if the cutoff is 1 mrem/yr, then less than300 facilities would have to report to EPA.The Agency has developed a system for dose determination that is basedon screening models originally developed by the NCRP. This system is aseries of screening tests each more complicated and more realistic thanthe next. Using this system, each affected facility will, annually, haveto check to see whether or not it needs to report to EPA. Even in it doesnot have to report, it must keep records of the results for 5 years todemonstrate that it has checked to see whether or not it needs to report.Although the report is based on a calendar year the dose standard appliesto any year, i.e. any period of 12 consecutive months.In order to simplify calculation of the source term, the Agency will allowthe use of generic emission factors. The derivation of these emission factorsis explained in BID: Compliance. These factors are applied to the quantityof radionuclides used annually at the facility. Radionuclides in sealedcontainers are excluded. The results of these calculations are used asthe input of emissions for the screening model mentioned above.Since these reports will provide EPA with the information it needs, NRC-licenseesare exempted from the requirements of 61.10.<T3>c.

They include uranium mills and tailings(non-radon emissions), hexafloride conversion plants, fuel fabricationplants and commercial nuclear power plants. These facilities are licensedby the NRC. (Uranium fuel enrichment facilities are not included in thiscategory because they are covered as DOE facilities.) These facilitiesare large sophisticated operations with the potential for large releasesof radionuclides.These facilities are not covered by a NESHAP. However, all releases fromthese facilities (air, water and direct gamma radiation) are covered underthe Uranium Fuel Cycle Standard, 40 CFR 190. This standard was promulgatedby EPA under the authority of the AEA and is enforced by NRC. Under thestandard, the combined releases of all UFC facilities must not cause anyindividual to receive a dose of more than 25 mrem/y to the whole body orto any organ except the thyroid (which can receive 75 mrem/y). This standardhas been implemented and enforced by the NRC. In the past, the Administratorhas decided not to regulate this category under section 112, because hedetermined that the AEA standard protected public health with an amplemargin of safety. EPA's decision not to regulate this category is one ofthe issues in the current litigation. After reconsidering this issue, EPAhas decided to analyze UFC facilities using the same four regulatory optionsused for other categories.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment for this category is the combination of the resultsof the assessments of the different types of facilities included in thiscategory. The source term for emissions from uranium mill tailing pilesis estimated from a model mill using NRC methodology. The estimate doesnot include radon releases which are covered by a separate NESHAP. Meteorologicaland population data are based on typical mill sites. The assessment ofthe two uranium hexafluoride conversion plants is based on reported emissionsand census population distributions using nearby meteorological data.The assessment for fuel fabrication plants is based on reported emissionsand census population distributions from large facilities. The emissionestimate for nuclear power plants is based on actual releases from operatingplants. Population data is taken from NRC reference populations for coastal,river and lake sites. Assessments consider effects of multiple reactorsat a site, but not the overlap of multiple sites. Virtually the entireU.S. population lives within 80 km of at least one UFC facility.The results of the analysis show that the most exposed individual receivesa dose associated with an increased risk of fatal cancer of 2.2andmultiply;10^\4\.There is less than 0.1 fatal cancer per year in the population, and virtuallyall the population risk is received by people with a lifetime risk of lessthan 1andmultiply;10^\6\.Table 8 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternatives 2 and3.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI, to the UFC facilities source categoryare described below.<T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum individual risk to any individual is approximately2.2andmultiply;10^\4\ which is higher than the level preferred under thecase-by-case approach. The estimated annual incidence is 0.1 fatal cancersper year, and almost all of that risk is borne by people whose risk isless than 1andmultiply;10^\6\.EPA examined several alternatives before determining the acceptable level.Those alternatives and the risks they present are illustrated in Table8. After examining these different options, the Administrator proposesto determine that Alternative 1 (baseline emissions) is acceptable underthe case-by-case approach. A maximum individual risk higher than the preferredlevel is acceptable in this case because the risk distribution is suchthat incidence is only 0.1 per year.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>8._<T4>Alternatives for Acceptable Risk From Uranium Fuel Cycle Facilities</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><H1>Alternative 2</H1><H1>Alternative 3</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (lifetime)<D>2.2andmultiply;10</D>^\4\<D>1.4andmultiply;10 \4\</D><D>3.0andmultiply;10</D>^\5\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km (death/y)<D>0.10</D><D>0.10</D><D>0.10</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Risk individual<D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1 </ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2 </ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3 </ITAG><D>95</D><D>\1\</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4 </ITAG><D>13,000</D><D>13,000</D><D>4,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5 </ITAG><D>190,000</D><D>190,000</D><D>190,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6 </ITAG><D>240M</D><D>240M</D><D>240M</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Risk incidence<D/><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1 </ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2 </ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3 </ITAG><D>0.00024</D><D>\1\</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4 </ITAG><D>0.0024</D><D>0.0024</D><D>0.001</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5 </ITAG><D>0.0093</D><D>0.0093</D><D>0.0093</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6 </ITAG><D>0.091</D><D>0.091</D><D>0.091</D><F/><T3>Other Health Impacts: </T3>Total cancers no more than twice fatal cancers.<F>\1\ At least one person may be at this risk level, total number of peopleunknown because site visit has not been made.</F></ITAG><T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>EPA has examined the controltechnology necessary to lower emissions from UFC facilities. To reducethe complexity of studying the costs and benefits of all different controloptions, EPA has concentrated on the facilities with the largest emissions.The costs and benefits of controlling emissions can be seen in Table 9.Based on the costs of achieving alternative 2 and the fact that it wouldreduce the incidence of fatal cancer by less than one case every 100 years,and considerating the small decreases in individual risk that would result,EPA has determined that it is not necessary to further reduce risks belowtheir current level. Therefore, EPA believes that limiting emissions totheir current level, represented by a level of 10 mrem/y ede, will protestpublic health with an ample margin of safety. No further reduction belowthe safe level is required. However, EPA believes that the risks are highenough, and have the potential to go significantly higher, that the protectionof public health requires that a NESHAP be promulgated to insure that thecurrent levels of emissions which are safe with an ample margin of safetyare not increased. Therefore, EPA is proposing a NESHAP mandating thatradionuclide emissions from UFC facilities shall not cause any individualto receive a dose of greater than 10 mrem/y ede. <T3>Approach B: Incidence Based Approach.

To reducethe complexity of studying the costs and benefits of all different controloptions, EPA has concentrated on the facilities with the largest emissions.The costs and benefits of controlling emissions to various levels can beseen in Table 9.Based on the costs of achieving alternative 2 and the small associateddecreases in individual risk, and the fact that virtually no reductionin incidence would result, EPA has determined that it is not necessaryto further reduce risks below their current level. Therefore, EPA believesthat limiting emissions to their current levels, represented by a levelof 10 mrem/y ede, will protect public health with an ample margin of safety.No further reduction below the safe level is required.

Elemental Phosphorus Plants<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>Elemental phosphorus plants extract pure phosphorus from ore for use inthe chemical industry. These facilities emit radionuclides into the airbecause phosphate ore is high in uranium and its decay products. Thesedecay products, especially polonium-210 and lead-210, become volatilizedduring the extraction process and are released into the atmosphere. Thereare eight (5 operational, 3 standby) elemental phosphorus plants locatedin four different states. However, most of the emissions come from twoplants in Idaho.Due to the types of radionuclides emitted by these plants, virtually allthe dose is received by the lung through the inhalation pathway causingan increased risk of lung cancer. This risk can be controlled through theuse of a standard which directly limits emissions of polonium-210 (controlmeasures which limit polonium-210 also limit emissions of lead-210). Thereis no need to write dose standards.Elemental phosphorus plants are currently regulated by a NESHAP that limitstheir emissions to no more than 21 curies of polonium-210 annually.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of elemental phosphorus plants is a site-by-siteassessment of operating and standby plants, based on monitored data andthroughput. Meteorological data was taken from nearby stations. Maximumindividual risks were assessed at actual residences or at a location 1500m in the predominant wind direction. The location of nearby populationswas taken from census tract data.According to the assessment, EPA estimates that the most exposed individualreceives a lifetime fatal cancer risk of 5.6andmultiply;10^4. There is anincreased incidence of 0.072 fatal cancer per year in the nearby (within80 km) population. Over 75 percent of the exposed population receives risksof less than 1andmultiply;10^6.Table 10 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternatives 2,3 and 4.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI to the elemental phosphorus plants sourcecategory are described below.<T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum individual risk to any individual is approximately5.6andmultiply;10^4 which is higher than the level generally preferred underthe case-by-case approach. The estimated annual incidence is less than0.072 fatal cancers per year.EPA examined several alternatives before determining the acceptable level.Those alternatives and the risks they present are illustrated in Table10. After examining these different options, the Administrator proposesto determine that alternative 1 (10 Ci/y of polonium-210) is acceptableunder the case-by-case approach. A maximum individual risk higher thanthe preferred level is acceptable in this case because the risk distributionis such that incidence is only 0.072 per year.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>TABLE 10.</T4>_<T4>Alternatives for Acceptable Risk From Elemental Phosphorus Plants</T4><H1> </H1><H1>alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><H1>alt. 2</H1><H1>alt. 3</H1><H1>alt. 4</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (lifetime)<D>5.6andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>2.4andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>2.4andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>1.1andmultiply;10</D>^5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km (death/y)<D>0.072</D><D>0.024</D><D>0.011</D><D>0.0022</D></ITAG>Risk individual<ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>6,000</D><D>800</D><D>\1\800</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>100,000</D><D>15,000</D><D>8,000</D><D>600</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>310,000</D><D>330,000</D><D>190,000</D><D>12,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>1.4M</D><D>1.5M</D><D>1.6M</D><D>1.8M</D>Risk incidence<ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>0.012</D><D>0.0019</D><D>0.0019</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>0.038</D><D>0.0037</D><D>0.0021</D><D>0.00009</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>0.016</D><D>0.012</D><D>0.0053</D><D>0.00030</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>0.0056</D><D>0.0065</D><D>0.0021</D><D>0.0018</D><F/><T3>Other Health Impacts: </T3>Non-fatal cancers no more than 5% of deaths.<F>\1\ Alternative 3 has no additional impact on the plant causing thehighest risk.</F></ITAG><T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>EPA has examined the controltechnology necessary to lower emissions from elemental phosphorus plants.The costs and benefits of controlling emissions can be seen in Table 11.Based on the costs of achieving alternative 2 and the very small reductionsof incidence and the small decrease in maximum individual risk that wouldresult, EPA has determined that it is not necessary to further reduce risksbelow their current level.

Therefore, EPA believes that limiting emissions to theircurrent level, represented by a level of 10 Ci/y polonium-210, will protectpublic health with an ample margin of safety.

Implementation</ITAG>The current NESHAP for elemental phosphorus plants required each plantto either conduct an initial test on its emissions or get a waiver fromtesting. After this original report no further testing was required, unlessplant operations were changed significantly. EPA plans to continue thissystem, without the waiver provisions. Tests conducted under the currentNESHAP are still valid if conditions have not changed. Plants will be required to monitor their operations continuously and keeprecords of the results of their monitoring onsite for five years. Plantowners will have to certify on a semiannual basis that no changes in operationsthat would require new testing have occurred. Although the report is basedon a calendar year the emission limit applies to any year, i.e. any periodof 12 consecutive months. Since the reports from provide EPA with the information it needs, elementalphosphorous plants are exempted from the requirements of 61.10.E. Coal-Fired Utility and Industrial Boilers <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>This category covers electrical utility and industrial boilers which emitthe radionuclides naturally present in coal. Coal contains only minuteamounts of radionuclides. This category is being considered because largeboilers burn large quantities of coal and are so widely dispersed throughoutthe nation that the radionuclide emissions are estimated to cause 0.8 fatalcancer a year among the U.S. population. Emissions from coal-fired boilers are presently regulated under NationalAmbient Air Quality Standards for particulate matter. In addition, thelarger new coal-fired boilers have to meet New Source Performance Standards(NSPS). Coal-fired boilers are regulated for the other pollutants theyemit including SO<T2>2</T2>, particulates, and other hazardous air pollutants such as arsenicand benzene. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of coal-fired boilers is based on extrapolationsof real emissions with model populations. Estimates of emissions are fromthe reference facilities with the largest emissions. These emissions wereanalyzed on four sites: Urban, suburban, rural and remote. Further informationwas received from a recent study of emissions from coal-fired boilers doneby the Office of Air Quality, Planning and Standards. EPA assumed thatthe entire U.S. population lives within 80 km of at least one coal firedboiler. EPA estimates that the maximum individual risk is 3andmultiply;10^5 and thatthere are 0.8 fatal cancers a year caused by radionuclide emissions fromcoal fired boilers. Virtually all the fatal cancer risk is borne by individualswhose lifetime fatal cancer risk is less than 1andmultiply;10^4 .Table 12 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternative 2. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI, to the coal-fired boilers source categoryare described below. <T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum individual risk to any individual is approximately3andmultiply;10^4 which achieves a lower level of risk than the upper boundthat is described in the case-by-case approach.

Introduction</ITAG>Management and storage operations for high-level nuclear waste, spent fueland transuranic waste are addressed in the categories for DOE facilitiesand NRC-licensed and non-DOE Federal facilities described above. This categoryaddresses facilities constructed and dedicated to long term disposal ofsuch materials pursuant to regulations to be promulgated at 40 CFR 191Supbart B. Site characterization studies for the first such repositoryare being conducted by DOE and currently center on Yucca Mountain Nevada.In addition, DOE is constructing a test Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP)which may be dedicated as a disposal facility.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of HLW disposal facilities is based upon DOE engineeringestimates for conceptual designs for the WIPP In New Mexico, an MRS facilityand a permanent repository at Yucca Mountain. They were analyzed by EPAand are believed to be reasonable. Although the decision on Yucca Mountain'sacceptability has not yet been made, for purposes of improving the accuracyof the analysis, using a real site, EPA has analyzed the Yucca Mountainsite. Population data was taken from U.S. census data at these sites.EPA estimates that the maximum individual risk is 3andmultiply;10^7 and thatthere would be 0.0001 fatal cancers a year caused by radionuclide emissionsfrom HLW disposal facilities to less than 1 million people within 80 kmof these facilities. All the fatal cancer risk is borne by individualswhose total fatal cancer risk is less than 1andmultiply;10^6.The reason why the emissions and risks are so low is the nature of thedisposal operations. Sealed sources will be brought to the site and buriedbelow ground. Normal operations preclude any significant air emissions.Table 14 presents the risk estimates at baseline in terms of estimatedannual fatal cancer incidence, maximum individual lifetime risk, totalpopulation exposed at or above particular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution),and annual incidence attributable to the population exposed at each risklevel.<ITAG tagnum="81">3.

The Administrator determines that the estimateof emissions from disposal of HLW represents a level that will protectpublic health with an ample margin of safety. EPA believes that since theemissions are so low, and there is no reason to expect that emissions toair would significantly increase, no NESHAP is needed.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 14._<T4>Alternatives for Acceptable Risk From High Level Nuclear Waste DisposalFacilities</T4><H1>  </H1><H1>Alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (lifetime) <D>2.8</D>andmultiply;10^7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km (death/y) <D>0.00011</D></ITAG>Risk individual:<ITAG tagnum="2">E-2 to E-1 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-3 to E-2 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-4 to E-3 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-5 to E-4 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-6 to E-5 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Less E-6 <D>780,000</D></ITAG>Risk incidence:<ITAG tagnum="2">E-2 to E-1 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-3 to E-2 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-4 to E-3 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-5 to E-4 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">E-6 to E-5 <D>0</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Less E-6 <D>0.0001</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70"/><T3>Other Health Impacts:</T3> Total cancers no more than twice fatal cancers.<ITAG tagnum="70">No currently operating facilities.

Radon Releases from Department of Energy Facilities<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction.</ITAG>The DOE administers many facilities, including government-owned, contractor-operatedfacilities across the country. Some of these facilities have large stockpilesof radium-containing material. Because this ore was originally high inuranium content, the tailings material that is left has a high radium contentand, therefore, emits large quantities of radon. This material is storedin at least five different sites owned or controlled by DOE in Missouri,New Jersey, New York, Ohio and Utah. DOE is presently in the process oftaking remedial action at these sites to dispose of the material on a long-termbasis.The current NESHAP covering DOE facilities does not regulate radon emissions.Environmental groups challenged EPA in court to address the problem ofradon emissions from DOE facilities. EPA is responding with this proposedNESHAP.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of DOE facilities is a site-by-site assessment ofcurrent emissions. Radon emission estimates were mostly measured valuesprovided by DOE or estimated from measured radium-226 concentrations inthe wastes. The meteorological data were taken from nearby stations andpopulations are based on U.S. census tract data.According to EPA's analysis, lifetime fatal cancer risk to the most exposedindividual is 2.4andmultiply;10^\3\. DOE facilities cause an estimated 0.16fatal cancer per year to the 25.7 million persons within 80 km of the DOEfacilities. Approximately 40 percent of the risk to that population comesfrom individuals whose risk is over 1andmultiply;10^\6\. It is noted thatthis analysis does not consider the planned remedial actions which willbe implemented under CERCLA, as amended, in conjunction with either InteragencyAgreements or Federal Facilities Agreements with EPA. Remedial action isscheduled at the Monticello Mill Tailings Pile near Monticello, Utah, pera signed Federal Facility Agreement.Table 15 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternatives 2,3 and 4.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI to the radon emissions from the DOEsource category are described below.<T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum lifetime individual risk to any individualis 2.4andmultiply;10^\3\ which is higher than the level generally preferredunder the case-by-case approach. The estimated annual incidence is approximately0.16 fatal cancer per year, and approximately 40 percent of that risk isborne by people whose risk is over 1andmultiply;10^\6\. EPA has examinedseveral alternatives before determining the acceptable level; those alternativesand the risks they present are illustrated in Table 15. After examiningthese different options, the Agency would propose that the risk associatedwith alternative 2 represents a level that is acceptable under the case-by-caseapproach. A maximum individual risk higher than the preferred level isacceptable in this case because the risk distribution is such that incidenceis only 0.042 per year.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>EPA has examined several alternativelevels of control of radon emissions from DOE facilities. The costs andbenefits of controlling emissions can be seen in Table 16. Based on thecosts of further controls to reduce radon emissions, and the small decreasesin risk and very small incidence reductions they represent, EPA has determinedthat it is not necessary to further reduce risks below the acceptable level,alternative 2. Therefore, EPA is proposing a NESHAP limiting radon emissionsfrom DOE facilities to 20 pCi/m\2\^s, which will protect public healthwith an ample margin of safety.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>15._<T4>Alternatives for Acceptable Risk from Radon from DOE Facilities</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><H1>Alt. 2</H1><H1>Alt. 3</H1><H1>Alt. 4</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (lifetime)<D>2.4andmultiply;10</D>^3<D>2.9andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>1.8andmultiply;10</D>^4<D>1.3andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km (death/y)<D>0.16</D><D>0.042</D><D>0.021</D><D>0.012</D></ITAG>Risk individual:<ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>90</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>3,500</D><D>180</D><D>70</D><D>45</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>26,000</D><D>4,800</D><D>2,000</D><D>500</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>1.4M</D><D>96,000</D><D>44,000</D><D>15,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>27M</D><D>28M</D><D>28M</D><D>28M</D>Risk incidence:<ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>0.002</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>0.011</D><D>0.0004</D><D>0.0001</D><D>0.00007</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>0.007</D><D>0.0020</D><D>0.00057</D><D>0.0002</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>0.040</D><D>0.0027</D><D>0.0012</D><D>0.0005</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>0.10</D><D>0.037</D><D>0.020</D><D>0.01</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Other Health Impacts: </T3>Non-fatal cancers no more than 5 percentof deaths.<T3>Approach B: Incidence Based Approach.

Therefore, EPA is proposinga NESHAP limiting emissions to 0.02 pCi/m\2\^s which would protect publichealth with an ample margin of safety. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation </ITAG>This NESHAP is a flux standard that limits the emission of radon from DOEfacilities. The standard limits the amount of radon that can be emittedper unit area (m\2\) per unit of time (s). This standard is not an averageper facility but is an average per radon source. This will require thatall radon sources must be disposed of in a manner that will reduce theradon flux to meet the standard. The proposed standard will be effective immediately upon promulgation.While EPA believes that DOE will be able to meet this standard, EPA recognizesthat in some cases DOE may need some time to perform all the actions necessaryto reduce radon emissions to the required levels. In such a case, DOE mayrequest a waiver of the compliance deadline of up to two years, under section112(c)(1)(b)(ii) of the CAA. If two years are not sufficient time EPA isprepared to discuss schedules for compliance. EPA recognizes that the requirementsof CERCLA and other environmental laws will have to be considered in thesediscussions. Since the reports of the testing provide EPA with the information it needs,DOE-facilities are exempted from the requirements of 61.10. H. Phosphogypsum Stacks<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>Phosphogypsum stacks are large piles of waste from wet acid phosphorusfertilizer production. Phosphogypsum stacks are found at 41 different sitesin 12 states. Because phosphate ore is relatively high in uranium and radium,phosphogypsum stacks are also high in these elements. The presence of radiumin the stacks causes them to release radon into the atmosphere. In connectionwith the litigation, EPA has agreed to propose a standard for this sourcecategory. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA has performed a pile-by-pile assessment of radon releases at 58 phosphogypsumstacks at 41 sites. Radon emissions are based on measured radon fluxesat stacks in Florida and Idaho, the radium content of the phosphate rockand the estimated area of the stacks. Maximum individual risks are basedon the locations of nearby residents obtained from industry or topographicalmaps. Where information was unavailable, people were assumed to be 800meters from the site boundary. Populations within 80 km were taken fromcensus tract data.The estimated maximum individual risk of fatal cancer from radon emissionsfrom phosphogypsum stacks is 2.0andmultiply;10 ^4. The radon emissions cause0.97 fatal cancers per year to the population within 80 km. Approximately90% of the risk to the population is borne by people whose risk is lessthan 1andmultiply;10 ^5, and 40% of the risk is borne by people whose riskis less than 1andmultiply;10 ^6. Table 17 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles.

Implementation</ITAG>This NESHAP is a flux standard that limits the emission of radon from phosphogypsumstacks. The standard limits the amount of radon that can be emitted perunit area (m\2\) per unit of time (s). This standard is not an averageper facility but is an average per phosphogypsum stack. This will requirethat all stacks be disposed of in a manner that will reduce the radon fluxto meet the standard.Sixty days after the effective date of this rule or sixty days after theoperator ceases using a phosphogypsum stack the operator must test thestack to determine whether or not the stack is in compliance with the fluxstandard. If Approach A or B is selected it is expected that all stackswill be in compliance with the standard. If Approach C or D are selectedthe stacks will most likely not be in compliance unless they cover thestack with dirt, or something else, to reduce the radon flux off the stack.If an operator knows that the stack cannot meet the standard, the operatorcan admit noncompliance instead of testing the stack.Stacks must be retested every two years unless EPA requires more frequenttesting or EPA determines that less frequent testing is sufficient to assurecompliance with the standard. EPA will also reduce the need for testingif EPA determines that testing will interfere with ongoing operations designedto cover the stack.Since the reports of the testing provide EPA with the information it needs,phosphogypsum stacks are exempted from the requirements of 61.10.I. Underground Uranium Mines<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>When these mines are operating, their ventilation systems emit large amountsof radon into the atmosphere. The levels of radon in an unventilated mineare a hazard to the miners. Ventilating to reduce radon exposure to theminers increases exposure to the general population.Underground uranium mines are regulated by an existing NESHAP. This NESHAPrequires bulkheading of unused portions of the mines in an effort to reducethe internal wall surface area of the mine and thereby reduce radon emissionsinto the mine air. EPA has found that this system is unworkable for existingmines, and it is unproven for new mines. The interiors of these mines areso extensively interconnected that any attempt at bulkheading either producesno results or prevents fresh air from getting to the miners.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of underground uranium mines is a site-by-site assessmentof all operating or operable mines. Emission estimates were based on radonconcentration or working level measurements and ventilation rates providedby mine operators. The meteorological data was taken from nearby stations and populationsfrom 5 to 80 km are based on U.S. census tract data. Population distributionswithin 5 km were taken from site visits or obtained from mine owners.The maximum individual risk of fatal cancer from radon emissions from undergrounduranium mines is 1.2andmultiply;10^3. The radon emissions cause 0.77 fatalcancer per year to the population within 80 km.Table 19 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level.

Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum individual risk to any individual is 1.2andmultiply;10^3which is higher than the level preferred under the case-by-case approach.The estimated annual incidence is 0.77 fatal cancer per year. EPA has examinedseveral alternatives before determining the acceptable level; those alternativesand the risks they present are illustrated in Table 19. After examiningthese different alternatives, the Agency would propose that the risks associatedwith alternative 2 represents the level that is acceptable under the case-by-caseapproach. Alternative 2 limits the emissions to 1500 Ci/y of radon. Anemissions limit of 1500 Ci/y provides an acceptable level of risk.However, EPA recognizes that, among the source categories analyzed, uraniummines present a unique situation in determining an acceptable level ofrisk. This occurs because Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)standards require owners to protect mine workers by operating mine ventilationequipment to reduce the radon levels within the mines. This results inemissions of whatever amount of radon is necessary to reduce the radonlevels in the mines to the required levels.After considering the conflict in the goals of the MSHA regulations andthe goals of the CAA, EPA has concluded that emissions higher than 1500Ci/y can be allowed without increasing the risk to the nearby individuals.If a mine releases its exhaust fan emissions from a 30-meter stack, thenradon emissions of 5,000 Ci/y would result in the same level of risk tothe most exposed individuals as a ground level releases of 1500 Ci/y. Thisalternative provides an effective means to ventilate the mine, reducingradon levels in the mine, while protecting those persons exposed to theemissions from a mine. Therefore, the Agency would propose that the risksassociated with exhaust vent emissions of radon from underground uraniummines emitted either at ground level with an emission limit of 1500 Ci/yor from a stack that is at least 30 meters high with an emission limitof 5000 Ci/y provides an acceptable level of risk.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Based on the costs of furthercontrols to reduce radon emissions, including the likelihood of closuresand the decreases in risk and very small incidence reductions they represent,see Table 20, EPA has determined that it is not necessary to further reducerisks below the acceptable level, alternative 2.

After examining these different alternatives, the Administrator hasdetermined that alternative 2 represents the level that is safe with anample margin of safety. Alternative 2 limits the emissions to 1500 Ci/yof radon. An emissions limit of 1500 Ci/y provides a level of emissionsthat is safe with an ample margin of safety. However, EPA recognizes that, among the source categories analyzed, uraniummines present a unique situation in determining an acceptable level ofrisk. This occurs because Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA)standards require owners to protect mine workers by operating mine ventilationequipment to reduce the radon levels within the mines.

After considering the conflict in the goals of the MSHA regulations andthe goals of the CAA, EPA has concluded that emissions higher than 1500Ci/y can be allowed without increasing the risk to the nearby individuals.If a mine releases its exhaust fan emissions from a 30-meter stack, thenradon emissions of 5,000 Ci/y would result in the same level of risk tothe most exposed individuals as a ground level release of 1500 Ci/y.

Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3>A radon emissions limit of 5 Ci/y of radon would expose an individualto a lifetime risk of 1andmultiply;10^6. Therefore, under this approach,an acceptable level of emissions is 5 Ci/y of radon from any single undergrounduranium mine. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>A standard of 5 Ci/y radonwould be impossible for most underground uranium mines to meet. Since thisstandard would shut down the industry, there is no need to look at loweringit further. EPA is proposing that underground uranium mines not emit morethan 5 Ci/y radon-222 into the atmosphere in any year. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation</ITAG>This standard is an emission standard. Mines are limited in the amountof radon they emit from their exhaust vents. Due to Mine Safety and HealthAdministration (MSHA) regulations, which are designed to protect the minersfrom high levels of radon in the mine, the exhaust fans must be operatingwhenever there are miners working in the mine. This limits EPA flexibilityin developing other types of standards to control radon emissions. Under Approach A and B the limit is 1500 curies of radon a year. If minesemit radon from a stack 30 meters in height or higher, the risks to nearbyindividuals is reduced such that larger radon emissions will still resultin risk levels that are safe with an ample margin of safety. In an effortto provide flexibility for the mine owners in meeting their obligationsunder MSHA regulations, EPA will allow mines that have 30 meter stacksto emit up to 5,000 curies a year. Under Approach C, mines can emit up to 500 curies of radon a year, andunder Approach D, they can emit up to 5 curies of radon a year. Under allthe Approaches, mines will be required to measure and report their annualemissions. Although the report is based on a calendar year the emissionlimit applies to any year, i.e. any period of 12 consecutive months. Sincethese reports provide EPA with the information it needs, underground uraniummines are exempted from the requirements of 61.10. J. Surface Uranium Mines  <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction </ITAG>Surface mining is accomplished by the excavation of one or more pits toexpose uranium ore for removal. While this technique has accounted forabout 50-70% of the uranium ore tonnage produced in this country between1956 and 1985, much of today's uranium production is from underground minesand other sources. In the past, annual production from surface mines rangedfrom a few hundred tons of ore to 100,000 tons or more. In recent years,surface mining operations have been very large, typically 100,000 tonsor more. Due to the dramatic decline in the uranium industry since 1981,the number of surface mines in operation in the U.S. has dropped from 50in 1981 to just 2 in 1987. While only 2 mines are currently active, thereremain about 1,200 mines in the U.S. in various stages of reclamation. During surface mining, topsoil may be segregated and saved for reclamation;overburden is piled on land beside the pit. The pit and overburden representsa large surface area from which radon can escape into the atmosphere. Radonemissions are higher than usual because radium concentrations are largerthan average near bodies of uranium ore. Health, safety and environmental hazards associated with uranium miningare regulated by a variety of Federal and State laws. As a result of thelaws and regulations, uranium mines, especially surface operations, arevastly different operations today than during the 1950s and 1960s. Manyof the inactive mines are presently being reclaimed under state law. Reclamationof the mines significantly reduces radon emissions. In the past, EPA decidednot to promulgate a NESHAP for this category. That decision was challengedin litigation and is being reexamined in this rulemaking.  <ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk </ITAG>EPA conducted a field study during the summer of 1988 to obtain informationwith which to model the surface mining industry so that estimates of riskfrom surface mining could be made. Radiometric surveys were conducted ofthe two active mines, located in Texas and Wyoming, and 25 inactive mineslocated in Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming.In addition, the demographic and meteorologic data were gathered in andaround each mining site.  The maximum individual risk of fatal cancer from radon emissions from surfaceuranium mines is 1.0andmultiply;10^4. The radon emissions cause 0.016 fatalcancer per year to the population within 80 km. Over 80% of the risk tothe population is borne by people whose risk is less than 1andmultiply;10^5,and 50% of the risk is borne by people whose risk is less than 1andmultiply;10^6.Table 21 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels, (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternative 2.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches  </ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI, to the surface uranium mines sourcecategory are described below. <T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach.

After examining these different alternatives, the Agency hasdetermined that baseline emissions, alternative 1, represents the levelthat is acceptable under the case-by-case approach. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Based on the costs of furthercontrols to reduce radon emissions, and the decreases in risk and verysmall incidence reductions they represent, see Table 22, EPA has determinedthat it is not necessary to further reduce risks below the safe baselinelevel, alternative 1. Current emissions have an associated risk which issafe with an ample margin of safety. Especially important in this determinationis the extremely low population risk and the current state reclamationsystem which is working to reduce its already low risks. Due to the depressed state of the uranium mining industry, there is noreason to believe that any new surface mines will be constructed.

EPA is proposing a NESHAPlimiting emissions of radon to 0.02 pCi/m 2^s which would protect publichealth with an ample margin of safety.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation</ITAG>This NESHAP is a flux standard that limits the emission of radon from uraniummines. The standard limits the amount of radon that can be emitted perunit area (m2) per unit of time (s). This standard is an average per mineincluding the overburden. This will require that all mimes must be disposedof in a manner that will reduce the radon flux to meet the standard.Sixty days after the effective date of this rule or sixty days after theoperator ceases using a surface uranium mine the operator must test themine to determine whether or not the mine is in compliance with the fluxstandard. If an operator knows that the mine cannot meet the standard,the operator can admit noncompliance instead of testing.Mines must be retested every two years unless EPA requires more frequenttesting or EPA determines that less frequent testing is sufficient to assurecompliance with the standard. EPA will also reduce the need for testingif EPA determines that testing will interfere with ongoing operations designedto reduce the flux from the mine.Since the reports of the testing provide EPA with the information it needs,surface uranium mines are exempted from the requirements of 61.10.K. Radon Releases from Operating Uranium Mill Tailings Piles<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>The process of separating uranium from its ore creates waste material thatis called uranium mill tailings. Since uranium ore generally contains lessthan 1 percent uranium, uranium milling produces large quantities of tailings.These tailings are collected in impoundments that vary in size from 20to 400 acres. The tailings contain large amounts of radium, and, therefore,they emit large quantities of radon. There are 26 licensed uranium millsin the western United States. Due to the depressed state of the uraniumindustry, most of these mills are not currently operating.The Uranium Fuel Cycle standard, 40 CFR 190, does not regulate radon emissionsfrom the tailings piles. Radon emmissions during operating are currentlyregulated by a NESHAP which is a work practice standard which specifiestwo methods, one of which must be used in the construction of any new tailingsimpoundment. Existing tailing piles cannot be used after December 31, 1992.Extensions and exceptions can be granted that would allow an existing pileto continue to operate beyond the 1992 deadline. The piles must be disposedof in accordance with EPA's AEA standard, 40 CFR 192.For the current radionuclides NESHAP rulemaking, EPA is proposing rulesfor three different subcategories that deal with mill tailings: Operatingmill tailings_existing piles, operating mill tailings_new technology, anddisposal of uranium mill tailings (as a separate source category; see sectionVII.L of this notice).This source category, operating mill tailings, has two subcategories becauseexisting and future mill tailings piles present different problems. Existingmill tailings piles are large piles of wastes that emit radon. There isnothing that can be done to reduce the amount of radon they emit exceptcover them. New piles can be designed to utilize disposal systems thatreduce the problem before very large (hundreds of acres) piles that requiredisposal accumulate. The new technology cannot readily be used on old piles.It is easier and cheaper to simply cover up the existing piles than tobreak them up into a series of smaller piles and dispose of them separately.EPA has determined that it is not feasible to prescribe an emission standardfor radon emissons from uranium mill tailing piles. Radon is emitted fromthe surfaces of tailings piles in a manner analogous to fugitive dust emissionsand cannot be emitted through a conveyance designed and constructed tocapture such radom emissions. Instead, EPA is requiring on improved workpractice for the disposal of newly generated tailings and is specifyinga date of which all newly generated tailings must be managed by this workpractice.A crucial issue with all uranium mill tailing piles is that of timing.The ony way to permanently reduce radon emissions from a pile is to coverit up and dispose of it. The piles continue to emit radon at significantlevels which they remain uncovered. EPA has not dealt with this timingissue before. We are dealing with it at this time because there has beenlittle, if any, action taken to dispose of the piles. If EPA promulgatesa disposal NESHAP, it can require that disposal be started within a setperiod of time after operations cease or after the rule is promulgated.If this issue is not addressed with a disposal NESHAP, then a NESHAP coveringoperational piles could require termination of operations and start offinal disposal within a set time.Timing is also a significant issue for the owners of operating mill tailingspiles. Operators want to be able to continue to use their existing pilesfor as long as possible. This allows them to avoid spending money on disposalor new impoundments. In the current NESHAP, EPA dealt with this issue byallowing the continued use of all existing piles until December, 1992,and creating a system of exceptions and extensions that would allow continueduse for low risk piles until 2001. This system has been challenged as violatingthe section 112 requirement that NESHAP compliance be attained within 2years.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk </ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of operating uranium mill tailings is a site-by-siteassessment of all 26 currently licensed mills. Emissions were estimatedfrom the radium-226 concentrations in the tailings, the amount of tailings,and the assumption that 1 pCi/g of radium-226 in the tailings produces1 pCi/m 2-s of radon. The meteorological data was taken from nearby stationsand populations from 5 to 80 km are based on U.S. census tract data. Populationswithin 5 km were counted at each of the sites. EPA analyzed current emissionsand the emissions that would be expected when new tailings impoundmentsare created in the future.There are twelve licensed piles that are either operating or on standby.According to EPA's analysis, the lifetime fatal cancer risk to the mostexposed individual is 3.3andmultiply;10^3 from these twelve piles. Uraniummill tailings are estimated to cause 1.6 fatal cancer per year to the 4.5million persons within 80 km of the tailings piles.Tables 23 and 24 present example scenarios to show how different emissionlevels would result in different health risk profiles. The tables presentthe risk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancerincidence, maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed ator above particular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The tables alsopresent available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternatives 2,3 and 4.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI, to the radon emissions from the uraniummill tailings source category are described below.<T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum individual risk to any individual is 3.3andmultiply;10^3which is higher than the level generally preferred under the case-by-caseapproach. The estimated annual incidence within 80 km is 1.6 fatal cancersper year, and most of that risk is borne by people whose risk is less than1andmultiply;10^4. Many of the piles are closing which will increase emissionsfrom the tailings as they dry out. EPA has examined several alternativesbefore determining the acceptable level; those alternatives and the risksthey present are illustrated in Tables 23 and 24.After examining these different alternatives, the Agency would proposethat the risks associated with alternative 3 for these twelve existingpiles which limits the length of time that mills can continue to placenew tailings on existing impoundments to 2 years, and limits the emissionsto 6 pCi/m\2\^s radon after disposal is completed, and alternative 2 fornew technology for future piles, which requires a single large impoundment,represents the level that is acceptable under the case-by-case approach.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Mills cannot create new impoundmentsto replace the existing impoundments in less than two years. EPA has determinedthat no alternatives more restrictive than alternative 3 need to be analyzed.The costs of this alternative are described in Table 25. Therefore, EPAis proposing to allow existing impoundments to operate for no more thantwo years unless they meet the work practice requirements for new impoundments.There is no reason to require closure of an existing impoundment whichmeets the requirements for new impoundments so that a new impoundment whichis similar would need to be constructed.For new impoundments, EPA has analyzed the costs of further controls toreduce radon emissions, and the decreases in risk and very small incidencereductions they represent, see Table 26.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,8,8,8</C><T4>Table </T4>23._<T4>Alternatives For Acceptable Risk For Operating Uranium Mill TailingsPiles_Existing Piles \1\</T4><H1> </H1><H1>Alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><H1>Alternative 2</H1><H1>Alternative 3</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (andless; lifetime exposure)<D>3.3andmultiply;10</D>^3<D>1.4andmultiply;10</D>^3<D>4.6andmultiply;10</D>^4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km<D>1.6 for 15y (24)</D><D>1.6 for 6y (9.6)</D><D>1.6 for 2y (3.2)</D></ITAG>Risk individual<D/><D/><D/><ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>600</D><D>300</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>40,000</D><D>20,000</D><D>6,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>400,000</D><D>200,000</D><D>60,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>400,000</D><D>200,000</D><D>60,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>3.4M</D><D>3.8M</D><D>4.1M</D>Risk incidence<D/><D/><D/><ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1</ITAG><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2</ITAG><D>1.2</D><D>0.5</D><D>0.16</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3</ITAG><D>12.0</D><D>4.8</D><D>1.6</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4</ITAG><D>9.0</D><D>3.6</D><D>1.2</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5</ITAG><D>1.5</D><D>0.6</D><D>0.2</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6</ITAG><D>0.0015</D><D>0.0006</D><D>0.0002</D><F/><T3>Other Health Impacts: </T3>Non-fatal cancers no more than 5 percentdeaths.

Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3>As explained earlier, the radon emissions from uranium mill tailingsimpoundments cause more than one fatal cancer per year. Therefore, underthis approach, current emissions must be reduced to provide an acceptablelevel of risk. However if current NESHAP work practices are continued fornew impoundments, radon emissions will cause less than one fatal cancerper year and therefore present acceptable risks. For new technologies,Alternative 1 represents an acceptable level of risk for a relatively smallindustry (i.e., 12 mills), provided the industry remains at the currentlevel.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Mills cannot create new impoundmentsto replace the existing impoundments in less than two years, even if theyceased operations in the interim. EPA has determined that no alternativesmore restrictive than alternative 3 need to be analyzed. Therefore EPAwill allow existing impoundments that do not use new technology to operatefor no more than two years. There is no reason to require closing an existingimpoundment which meets the requirements for new impoundments so that anew impoundment which is similar would need to be constructed.For new impoundments, EPA has analyzed the costs of further controls toreduce radon emissions, and the decreases in risk and very small incidencereductions they represent, see Table 26. EPA has determined that no furtherreductions to alternative 3 or 4 are called for to provide an ample marginof safety.

The risks that result from allowingthe continued use of existing disposal methods that do not meet these workpractices bring the risks above the level of 1andmultiply;10^4. Therefore,under this approach, a work practice standard of phased or continuous disposalstarting on the effective date of the rule provides an acceptable levelof emissions.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Due to the costs and difficultyof further reducing emissions, see Table 26, and the low risks resultingfrom the use of the new work practice standards, alternatives 3 and 4,EPA believes that no further measures are needed. Existing impoundmentsthat meet the work practice standard will be allowed to continue to operate.Therefore, EPA is proposing a work practice NESHAP requiring either phasedor continuous disposal of tailings starting on the effective date of therule would protect public health with an ample margin of safety.<T3>Approach D: 1andmultiply;10</T3>^\6\ or Less Maximum Individual RiskApproach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. A radon emission limit of 0.02 pCi/m\2\^sresults in a lifetime risk of 1andmultiply;10^\6\ to the most exposed individual.Therefore, under this approach, an acceptable level of emissions is 0.02pCi/m\2\^s.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>A NESHAP limiting any increaseof ambient radon levels to 0.02 pCi/m\2\^s would protect public healthwith an ample margin of safety.

Therefore,under this approach, EPA is proposing to prohibit the production of newtailings.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation</ITAG>This NESHAP is a work practice standard designed to reduce radon emissionsby forcing mill operators to manage their tailings in a way that will reduceradon emissions. Under Approach A or B, mill operators would not be allowedto put any tailings on a mill tailings impoundment which does not meetthe new work practices, phased or continuous disposal, two years afterthe effective date of this NESHAP. EPA is making a generic finding thatat least two years is required for the construction of new impoundmentsusing the new control technology and that during that two year period allpersons will be protected from imminent endangerment from uranium milltailings piles.Under Approach C, mill operators would have to go to the new work practicesafter the effective date of the rule. Under Approach D, no new mill tailingsmay be produced starting after the effective date of the rule. EPA is forcedto go to this extreme solution because it knows of no way to manage newtailings that will result in risks of less than 1andmultiply;10^\6\.Since EPA already has the information it needs, uranium mill tailings areexempted from the requirements of 61.10.L. Radon Releases From the Disposal of Uranium Mill Tailings Piles<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Introduction</ITAG>After uranium mill tailings impoundments can no longer be used, they mustbe disposed of. In addition to the fourteen licensed piles that commerciallicensees are decommissioning, DOE controls 24 abandoned uranium mill tailingspiles. The 1978 Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act (UMTRCA) gaveDOE responsibility for remedial actions at these sites. This Act also requiresEPA to set environmental standards which control the releases from alldisposed uranium mill tailings impoundments.In the past, EPA decided not to regulate under the CAA the disposal ofuranium mill tailing impoundments regulated under UMTRCA. That decisionhas been challenged in court, so EPA is reexamining this category. TheUMTRCA regulation limits postclosure radon releases to 20 pCi/m\2\^s fromthe tailings piles.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Estimates of Exposure and Risk</ITAG>EPA's risk assessment of uranium mill tailings is a site-by-site assessmentof all 24 inactive piles and 14 licensed piles that are being decommissioned.An additional uncertainty to this risk assessment occurs because DOE currentlyhas plans to relocate eleven of the inactive mill tailings piles to unpopulatedareas; in addition, DOE plans to stabilize the remaining 13 piles pursuantto regulations in 40 CFR Part 192, Health and Environmental ProtectionStandards for Uranium and Thorium Mill Tailings. EPA has information inthe rulemaking record concerning DOE's plans which will be considered foruse in the development of the final rule.Emissions were estimated from the estimated area of the tailings pile combinedwith the assumed radon flux of 20 pCi/m\2\^s for reclaimed piles and 1pCi/m\2\^s per pCi/g of radium for unreclaimed piles. The meteorologicaldata was taken from nearby stations, and populations from 5 to 80 km arebased on U.S. census tract data. Populations within 5 km were measuredat the sites.According to EPA's analysis, lifetime fatal cancer risk to the most exposedindividual is 2.1andmultiply;10^\2\. The tailings piles cause 2.5 fatal cancersper year to the 9.7 million persons within 80 km.Table 27 presents example scenarios to show how different emission levelswould result in different health risk profiles. The table presents therisk estimates at baseline in terms of estimated annual fatal cancer incidence,maximum individual lifetime risk, total population exposed at or aboveparticular risk levels (i.e., risk distribution), and annual incidenceattributable to the population exposed at each risk level. The table alsopresents available estimates of annual incidence and maximum individuallifetime risk for a lower emission level identified as alternatives 2,3 and 4.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Application of Alternative Policy Approaches</ITAG>The decisions that would result from the application of the four policyapproaches described in Section VI to the radon emissions from the uraniummill tailings source category are described below.<T3>Approach A: Case-by-Case Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk. </T3>Asstated earlier, the maximum risk to any individual is 2.1andmultiply;10^\2\which is much higher than the level generally preferred under the case-by-caseapproach. The estimated annual incidence within 80 km is 2.5 fatal cancersper year. Most of that risk is borne by people whose risk is less than1andmultiply;10^\4\. EPA examined several alternatives before determiningthe acceptable level; those alternatives and the risks they present areillustrated in Table 27. After examining these different alternatives,the Agency would propose that the risks associated with alternative 3 isacceptable under the case-by-case approach.<T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Based on the costs of furthercontrols to reduce radon emissions, and the small decreases in risk, seeTable 28, EPA has determined that it is not necessary to further reducerisks below the safe level, alternative 3. EPA is proposing a NESHAP limitingradon emissions from the disposal of uranium mill tailings to 6 pCi/m\2\^s,which will protect public health with an ample margin of safety.<T3>Approach B: Incidence Based Approach. Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3>As explained earlier, the radon emissions from the disposal of uraniummill tailings cause 2.5 fatal cancers per year. Therefore, under this approach,current emissions provide a level of risk which is not acceptable. In orderto reach an acceptable risk, current emissions must be reduced by a factorof 2.5.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table </T4>27._<T4>Alternatives for Acceptable Risk for Disposal of Uranium Mill Tailings</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[Inactive and licensed]</ITAG><H1> </H1><H1>Alternative 1 (baseline)</H1><H1>Alt. 2</H1><H1>Alt. 3</H1><H1>Alt. 4</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Maximum individual risk (lifetime) <D>2.1x10</D>^\2\<D>1.0x10</D>^\3\<D>3.0x10</D>^\4\<D>1.0x10</D>^\4\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Incidence within 80 km (death/y) <D>2.7 </D><D>0.12</D><D> 0.040 </D><D>0.013</D></ITAG>Risk individual:<ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1 </ITAG><D>350</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2 </ITAG><D>12,000</D><D>(1)</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3 </ITAG><D>300,000</D><D>1,000</D><D>300</D><D>100</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4 </ITAG><D>3.4M</D><D>100,000</D><D>20,000</D><D>10,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5 </ITAG><D>2.5M</D><D>1.6M</D><D>300,000</D><D>200,000</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6 </ITAG><D>3.6M</D><D>8.0M</D><D>9.4M</D><D>9.5M</D>Risk incidence:<ITAG tagnum="3">E-2 to E-1 </ITAG><D>0.08</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-3 to E-2 </ITAG><D>0.3</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>0</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-4 to E-3 </ITAG><D>1.2</D><D>0.004</D><D>0.0005</D><D>0.0002</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-5 to E-4 </ITAG><D>0.9</D><D>0.04</D><D>0.005</D><D>0.002</D><ITAG tagnum="3">E-6 to E-5 </ITAG><D>0.2</D><D>0.045</D><D>0.014</D><D>0.005</D><ITAG tagnum="3">Less E-6 </ITAG><D>0.004</D><D>0.03</D><D>0.02 </D><D>0.007</D><F>\1\ We believe there could be a few people at this risk, but DOE maymove the piles in question.</F><F/><T3>Other Health Impacts: </T3>Non-fatal cancers no more than 5% of deaths.</ITAG><T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety. </T3>Based on an analysis of thecosts of various control alternatives and decreases in risk and incidencethey represent, see Table 28, EPA has determined that it is necessary toreduce risks to the level of alternative 3, but that further reductionsare unnecessary.

Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3>Since the dose/risk relationship for radon is well established it is easyto determine the correct standard under this approach. A radon emissionlimit of 2 pCi/m2^s results in a lifetime risk of 1andmultiply;10^4 to themost exposed individual. Therefore, under this approach, an acceptablelevel of emissions is 2 pCi/m2^s. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> Due to the costs and difficultyof further reducing emissions, EPA believes that no further reductionsbelow a risk level of 1andmultiply;10^4 are needed.

Decision on Acceptable Risk.</T3>A radon emission limit of 0.02 pCi/m2^s results in a lifetime risk of 1andmultiply;10^6to the most exposed individual. Therefore, under this approach, an acceptablelevel of emissions is 0.02 pCi/m2^s. <T3>Decision on Ample Margin of Safety.</T3> Due to the costs and difficultyof further reducing emissions, EPA believes that no further reductionsbelow a risk level of 1andmultiply;10^6 are needed. Therefore, EPA is proposinga NESHAP limiting any release of radon to 0.02 pCi/m2^s, which would protectpublic health with an ample margin of safety. <ITAG tagnum="81">4. Implementation </ITAG>Under this NESHAP, all uranium mill tailings will have to be covered toreduce the amount of radon they release. Under approaches A, B, C, andD, the standard limits the emission of radon from the mill tailings impoundments.The standard limits the amount of radon that can be emitted per unit area(m\2\) per unit of time (s). This standard is an average per mill tailingspile. Sixty days after the effective date of this rule or sixty days after thepile ceases to be operational, the owner will test the pile to determinewhether or not the pile is in compliance with the flux standard. If ownerknows that the pile cannot meet the standard, the owner can admit noncomplianceinstead of testing the pile. Piles must be retested every two years unless EPA requires more frequenttesting or EPA determines that less frequent testing is sufficient to assurecompliance with the standard. EPA will also reduce the need for testingif EPA determines that testing will interfere with ongoing operations designedto cover the pile. Since the reports of the testing provide EPA with the information it needs,uranium mill tailings are exempted from the requirements of 61.10. This standard like all NESHAPS requires compliance by existing sourceswithin 90 days after the effective date in accordance with the CAA, 42U.S.C. 7412(c)(1)(B)(i). EPA, however, is aware that many sources coveredby this subpart will not be able to come into compliance that quickly.EPA is prepared to develop expeditious compliance schedules in consultationwith affected parties within the framework of the waiver provision of 42U.S.C. 7412(c)(1)(B)(ii) following the procedures described in 40 CFR 61.10and 61.11 or through the enforcement mechanisms of 42 U.S.C. 7413, as appropriate.EPA recognizes that the requirements of CERCLA and other environmentallaws will have to be considered in these consultations. <ITAG tagnum="85">VIII. Legal Issues Raised by Parties in the Radionuclides Litigation</ITAG>The following is a discussion of the legal issues which have been raisedin the current litigation. We have omitted reference to issues where theyare resolved in the detailed discussion of the source categories earlierin the Preamble. 1. Can EPA Not Issue Standards Under Section 112 in Situations Where PeopleWill Be Killed by a Source of Pollution? Can EPA Disregard Projected Deathsas Insignificant? <T3>Response:</T3> EPA is presenting four different approaches for definingacceptable risk. Under all of these approaches, it is possible that a situationmay present an acceptable risk even though some fatal cancers are estimatedto be caused by the pollution. Any emissions of a pollutant assumed tobe nonthreshold is assumed to entail some risk, however small, of fatalcancer. Section 112 does not require EPA to define a safe level as thatlevel that entails no risk of fatal cancer. The DC Circuit Court, in the<T3>vinyl chloride</T3> decision, clearly stated that safe does not meanrisk free. EPA agrees with the Court that section 112 requires a findingof acceptable risks, acceptable for the world in which we live. This meansthat some risk of fatal cancer may be acceptable.2. Must NESHAPS Provide ``Equal Protection'' for All Individuals, IncludingThose in Small Population Groups?<T3>Response: </T3>EPA believes that everyone is entitled to be protectedby a standard that, overall, protects health with an ample margin of safety.Such a standard need not assure that every individual faces the same preciseMIR. As with any regulation of a point source of pollution, the sourcesconsidered for regulation in this Preamble give higher risks to the peoplewho are closer to the facility than to people who are farther away. Itis impossible to protect all people equally unless the emission limit and,therefore, the risk is zero. Under the CAA, EPA is only required to protectpublic health (which includes the health of individuals) with an amplemargin of safety; equal protection of all individuals is not required.3. Can EPA Set a Standard That EPA Does Not Find Protects Public HealthWith an Ample Margin of Safety? <T3>Response: </T3>EPA recognizes its duty to set NESHAPS that protectpublic health with an ample margin of safety. EPA will not establish aNESHAP that it does not find protects public health with an ample marginof safety. 4. Can EPA Set a Dose Standard?<T3>Response: </T3>Section 112 requires that EPA set standards which protectpublic health with an ample margin of safety. The section allows EPA toset emission standards or work practice standards. Dose standards are,in effect, emission standards, since the standards require the source tohave emissions that are low enough to meet the dose standard. There isa direct correlation between dose and risk. Sources would use the computercompliance models to track the doses caused by their emissions. For categories involving very large numbers of different radionuclides,EPA has chosen not to set specific radionuclide emission standards becausethey would be completely impractical. All radionuclides are different_theyhave different half-lives, emit different levels of different kinds ofenergy and affect different parts of the body. Health physicists for yearshave used the concept of radiological dose to account for these many effects.If EPA were not allowed to take advantage of this extensive body of knowledge,EPA would be forced to set separate emission standards for hundreds ofdistinct radionuclides. Since different sources use different radionuclidesin different combinations, and many individual radionuclides are presentin small amounts in only a few places; judged individually, it would generallybe difficult to justify standards that would require any decrease in emissions.Yet the combination of the individual radionuclide with the scores of othersthat may be released from a facility can cause a significant risk thatshould be regulated. 5. Is the Use of 1970 Census Data Instead of 1980 Census Data Acceptable?<T3>Response: </T3>1980 census data has been used in the present rulemaking.6. Can EPA Allow Non-Regulation and Rely on Industry Practices?<T3>Response: </T3>EPA is obligated in this litigation to reexamine eachsource category and assure that public health is protected with an amplemargin of safety. EPA may find that standards are unnecessary so long aspublic health is protected with an ample margin of safety. For example,if the risks caused by a source category's current emissions are low enoughto protect public health with an ample margin of safety, then the decisionwhether or not to set a baseline standard will be based on whether EPAhas any reason to believe that there is a need to insure that future emissionswill not increase. 7. Does EPA's Use of a Non-Threshold Hypothesis Require a Finding of SignificantRisk?<T3>Response: </T3>EPA thoroughly considered the results of risk assessmentsbefore making a finding of significant risk regarding radionuclides. Thisassessment was based, in part, on the scientific consensus of the non-thresholdcarcinogenicity of radionuclides. EPA does not believe a finding of carcinogenicityneed automatically result in a finding of significant risk. However, forradionuclides, the risk assessment supports EPA's finding of significantrisk. See, Section 112 discussion earlier in preamble and discussion ofindividual source categories. 8. Must Radon Emissions From Underground Uranium Mines Contribute a SignificantIncrement to the Total Human Exposure Burden in Order for Those EmissionsTo Be Regulated Under the Clean Air Act?<T3>Response: </T3>A level of emissions is not considered to be acceptablemerely because it is below background. The relevant question under section112 is whether, in the judgment of the Administrator, radionuclides cause,or contribute to, air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated toresult in an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible,or incapacitating reversible, illness. The Agency believes, based on substantialscientific evidence, that radionuclide emissions from underground uraniummines meet that test. See, preamble discussion of underground uranium mines.9. Are the Risks From Underground Uranium Mines Radon Emissions Real orHypothetical? Does It Matter? <T3>Response: </T3>EPA utilizes scientifically accurate procedures in evaluatingthe risks posed by each source category. While EPA is ultimately forcedto estimate these risks, the Agency has confidence in its methodology andconsiders the results to be a proper foundation for decisionmaking. 10. Can Calculations Based on a Hypothetical ``Maximally Exposed Individual''Be Used To Support a Finding of Significant Risk? <T3>Response: </T3>As a matter of expert judgment, EPA used a reasonablemix of data sources, using measured and estimated data inputs.<ITAG tagnum="84">IX. Request for Comments </ITAG>Throughout this notice, comments and information are requested on specificareas. In addition, partly in response to <T3>Vinyl Chloride, </T3>EPA is reexamining assumptions and decision methodsit has relied upon in making section 112 hazardous air pollutant regulatorydeterminations. As part of that process, EPA is seeking to engage the publicand all interested parties in discussion concerning both specific elementsof alternative proposals for radionuclide standards and a broader reexaminationof assumptions and decision methods. In an effort to structure that discussion, EPA has formulated the fouralternative approaches noted earlier for the control of hazardous air pollutantemissions under section 112 of the CAA. Today's <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice proposes these four approaches for thecontrol of air emissions of radon and other radionuclides and thereby providesthe opportunity for EPA to solicit comments from the public on a varietyof issues associated with this reexamination of the Federal program forhazardous air pollutants. Determinations on many of these specific issueswithin the proposed radionuclides and benzene regulations for proposalbenzene regulations, see 53 FR 28496-28592, July 28, 1988) may be expectedto set precedents for the approach to be used for the substantial numberof forthcoming NESHAP decisions. Major areas on which the Administratorrequests public comment include, among others:  (1) Should EPA consider all risk information in decision on risk acceptabilityor rely on a single numerical risk criterion? If multiple risk measuresare to be used as the basis for decisions on risk acceptability, how shouldEPA balance individual versus population risk reductions?  (2) What health risk is acceptable not considering the cost and technicalfeasibility of achieving it? Moreover, what constitutes an ample marginof safety in cases where all exposures pose some risk?  (3) Should EPA require standards pursuant to the ample margin of safetydecisions under section 112 that are ``technology forcing''? What criteriashould EPA use to define the ``availability'' and ``feasibility'' of technologicalcontrols?  (4) In the ample margin of safety determination, how should EPA balancethe residual health risks versus the possibility of plant closures?  (5) How should uncertainty in risk estimates be considered in these decisions? (6) How should EPA balance the various risk, technical, and economic considerationsin ample margin of safety decisions? How should EPA consider the ramificationsof potential errors and uncertainty of judgments on technology capabilityand costs? (7) Should EPA set a risk limit rather than a dose limit or an emissionlimit?  (8) Should EPA establish a system for certifying that phosphogypsum pilesand/or surface uranium mines are not going to be used anymore and, therefore,are ready for disposal? If so, what should that system be?  (9) Should EPA keep the current underground uranium mine NESHAP to controlradon emissions for new mines?   (10) Is the proposed regulatory approach for underground uranium minesappropriate? Should EPA consider other combinations of stack height andradon emission limits? (11) Is EPA's decision to list radionuclides under section 112 of the CAAappropriate? (12) Should EPA determine compliance with a dose standard on the basisof the point of maximum concentration where there is a residence, school,business or office or should some other point or criteria be used?  (13) If EPA uses schools, businesses or offices as potential compliancepoints should EPA's implementation system adjust the exposure receivedat those points with occupancy factors? If so, what should they be?  (14) Considering that accidental releases are included in the emissionssubject to the standard, should EPA include some additional provision inits compliance procedures dealing with accidents?<ITAG tagnum="84">X. Miscellaneous</ITAG>A. Docket The docket is an organized and complete file of all information consideredby EPA in the development of the standards. The docket allows interestedpersons to identify and locate documents so they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process. It also serves as the record for judicial review.Transcripts of the hearings, all written statements, the Agency's responseto comments, and other relevant documents have been placed in the docketand are available for inspection and copying during normal working hours.B. General Provisions Except where otherwise specifically stated, the general provisions of 40CFR Part 61, Subpart A apply to all sources regulated by this rule.C. Paperwork Reduction Act The information collection requirements in this proposed rule have beensubmitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) underthe <T3>Paperwork Reduction Act, </T3>44 U.S.C 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>An Information Collection Request document has been preparedby EPA (ICR NO. 1100), and a copy may be obtained from Carla Levesque,Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M St., SW. (PM-223); Washington, DC20460 or by calling (202) 382-2468. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto vary from 16 to 40 hours per response, with an average of 22 hours perresponse, including time for reviewing instructions, searching existingdata sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completingand reviewing the collection of information. Comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of this collectionof information, including suggestions for reducing this burden may be sentto the above address, but should be sent to the Office of Information andRegulatory Affairs, Paperwork Reduction Project (2060-0115), Office ofManagement and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: Desk Officerfor EPA.'' In developing the final rule EPA will respond to any OMB orpublic comments on the information collection requirements contained inthis proposal.D. Executive Order 12291Under Executive Order 12291, EPA is required to judge whether this regulationis a ``major rule'' and therefore subject to certain requirements of theOrder. The EPA has determined that regulations proposed for ApproachesA, B and C for all categories and for D for all non-radon radionuclidecategories will result in none of the adverse economic effects set forthin section I of the Order as grounds for finding a regulation to be a ``majorrule.'' These regulations are not major because: (1) Nationwide annualcompliance costs do not meet the $100 million threshold; (2) the regulationsdo not significantly increase prices or production costs; and (3) the regulationsdo not cause significant adverse effects on domestic competition, employment,investment, productivity, innovation, or competition in foreign markets.The regulations proposed under Approach D for radon categories, especiallyfor the disposal of mill tailings for radon, may cause industries to incurcosts exceeding $100 million and therefore may be determined to be a majorrule under Executive Order 12291. The regulations could cause significantadverse effects on domestic competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or competition in foreign markets. However, as provided bysection 8 of the Order, the Agency has not conducted a Regulatory ImpactAnalysis (RIA) of these proposed regulations because of the time constraintof the judicially-ordered schedule.All of the proposed regulations presented in this notice were submittedto OMB for review as required by Executive Order 12291. Any written commentsfrom OMB to EPA and any written EPA response to those comments will beincluded in the docket.E. Regulatory Flexibility AnalysisSection 603 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603, requires EPAto prepare and make available for comment an ``initial regulatory flexibilityanalysis'' in connection with any rulemaking for which there is a statutoryrequirement that a general notice of proposed rulemaking be published.The ``initial regulatory flexibility analysis'' describes the effect ofthe proposed rule on small business entities.However, section 604(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act provides thatsection 603 ``shall not apply to any proposed * * * rule if the head ofthe Agency certifies that the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.''EPA believes that virtually all small businesses covered by this finalrule already comply. In addition, EPA has placed reporting exemptions inthe rule for NRC-licensees to limit the amount of paperwork that wouldbe required by the smaller operators. Therefore, this rule will have littleor no impact on small businesses. A small business is one that has 750employees or fewer.For the preceding reasons, I certify that this rule will not have significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 61</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hazardous materials, Asbestos, Beryllium, Mercury,Vinyl chloride, Benzene, Arsenic, and Radionuclides.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 28, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

Purpose and Background</ITAG>This appendix contains guidance on: (1) Continuous stack sample collectionmethods appropriate for radionuclides; (2) radiochemical methods whichare used in determining the amounts of radionuclides collected by the stacksampling and; (3) quality assurance methods which are conducted in conjunctionwith these measurements. These methods are appropriate for emissions forstationary sources. A list of references is provided.Many different types of facilities release radionuclides into air. Theseradionuclides differ in the chemical and physical forms, half-lives andtype of radiation emitted. The appropriate combination of sample extraction,collection and analysis for an individual radionuclide is dependent uponmany interrelated factors including the mixture of other radionuclidespresent. Because of this wide range of conditions, no single method forcollection and analysis of a radionuclide is applicable to all types offacilities. Therefore, a series of methods based on ``principles of measurement''are described for both sample collection and analysis which are applicableto the measurement of radionuclides found in effluent streams at stationarysources. This approach provides the user with the flexibility to choosethe most appropriate combination of collection and analysis methods whichare applicable to the effluent stream to be measured.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Continuous Stack Sample Collection Methods</ITAG>Continuous sample collection methods are based on ``principles of samplecollection'' which are applicable to the continuous collection of radionuclidesfrom effluent streams at stationary sources. Radionuclides of most elementswill be in the particulate form in these effluent streams and can be readilycollected using a suitable filter media. Radionuclides of hydrogen, oxygen,carbon, nitrogen, the noble gases and in some circumstances iodine willbe in the gaseous form. Radionuclides of these elements will require eitherthe use of a flow through counter to directly measure the radionuclide,or suitable sorters or bubblers to collect the radionuclides.2.1 <T3>Radionuclides as Particulates.</T3> The extracted effluent stream ispassed through a filter media to remove the particulates. The filter musthave a high efficiency for removal of sub-micron particles. The guidancein ANSI-N13.1(1) shall be followed in using filter media to collect particulates.2.2 <T3>Radionuclides as Gases.</T3>2.2.1 <T3>The Radionuclide Tritium (H-3).</T3> Tritium in the form of water vaporis continuously collected from the extracted effluent sample by sorption,condensation or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectors may includesilica gel, molecular sieves, and ethylene glycol or water bubblers.Tritium in the gaseous form may be measured directly in the sample streamusing Method B-1 or may be oxidized using a metal catalyst to tritiatedwater and collected as described above.2.2.2 <T3>Radionuclides of Iodine.</T3> Iodine is collected from the continuouslyextracted sample by sorption or dissolution techniques. Appropriate collectorsmay include charcoal, impregnated charcoal, metal zeolites and causticsolutions.2.2.3 <T3>Radionuclides of Argon, Krypton and Xenon. </T3>Radionuclides of theseelements are measured directly in the continuously extracted sample streamusing a flow through counter or are collected from the extracted sampleby low temperature sorption techniques. Appropriate sorters may includecharcoal or metal zeolites.2.2.4 <T3>Radionuclides of Oxygen, Carbon, Nitrogen and Radon.</T3> Radionuclidesof these elements are measured directly in the continuously extracted sampleusing a flow through counter. Radionuclides of carbon in the form of carbondioxide may be collected by dissolution in caustic solutions.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Radionuclide Analysis Methods</ITAG>A series of methods based on ``principles of measurement'' are applicableto the analysis of radionuclides collected from airborne effluent streamsat stationary sources. These methods are applicable only under the conditionsstated and within the limitations described. Some methods specify thatonly a single radionuclide be present in the sample or the chemically separatedsample. This condition should be interpreted to mean that no other radionuclidesare present in quantities which would interfere with the measurement.Also identified are methods for a selected list of radionuclides. The listedradionuclides are those which are most commonly used and which have thegreatest potential for causing dose to members of the public.Use of methods based on principles of measurement other than those describedin this section must be approved in advance of use by the Administrator.For radionuclides not listed in this section, any of the described methodsmay be used provided the user can demonstrate that the applicability conditionsof the method have been met.The type of method applicable to the analysis of a radionuclide is dependentupon the type of radiation emitted, i.e., alpha, beta or gamma. Therefore,the methods described below are grouped according to principles of measurementsfor the analysis of alpha, beta and gamma emitting radionuclides.3.1 <T3>Methods for Alpha Emitting Radionuclides.</T3>3.1.1 <T3>Method A-1 Radiochemistry-Alpha Spectrometry.</T3><T3>Principle: </T3>The element of interest is separated from other elements,and from the sample matrix using radiochemical techniques. The proceduremay involve precipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers(elements chemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. Theelement is deposited on a planchet in a very thin film by electrodepositionor by coprecipitation on a very small amount of carrier, such as lanthanumfluoride. The deposited element is then counted with an alpha spectrometer.The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by the number of alphacounts in the appropriate energy region. A correction for chemical yieldand counting efficiency is made using a standardized radioactive nuclide(tracer) of the same element. If a radioactive tracer is not availablefor the element of interest, a predetermined chemical yield factor maybe used.<T3>Applicability: </T3>This method is applicable for determining the activityof any alpha-emitting radionuclide, regardless of what other radionuclidesare present in the sample provided the chemical separation step producesa very thin sample and removes all other radionuclides which could interferein the spectral region of interest. APHA-605(2), ASTM-D-3972(13).3.1.2 Method A-2, <T3>Radiochemistry-Alpha Counting.</T3> <T3>Principle:</T3> The element of interest is separated from other elements,and from the sample matrix using radiochemistry. The procedure may involveprecipitation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elementschemically similar to the element of interest) may be used. The elementis deposited on a planchet in a thin film and counted with an alpha counter.A correction for chemical yield (if necessary) is made. The alpha countrate measures the total activity of all emitting radionuclides of the separatedelement. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable for the measurement ofany alpha-emitting radionuclide, provided no other alpha emitting radionuclideis present in the separated sample. It may also be applicable for determiningcompliance, when other radionuclides of the separated element are present,provided that the calculated emission rate is assigned to the radionuclidewhich could be present in the sample that has the highest dose conversionfactor. IDO-12096(18). 3.1.3 Method A-3, <T3>Direct Alpha Spectrometry.</T3> <T3>Principle:</T3> The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is counteddirectly on an alpha spectrometer. The sample must be thin enough and collectedon the surface of the filter so that any absorption of alpha particle energyin the sample or the filter, which would degrade the spectrum, is minimal.<T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable to simple mixtures ofalpha emitting radionuclides and only when the amount of particulates collectedon the filter paper are relatively small and the alpha spectra is adequatelyresolved. Resolutions should be 50 eV (HWFM) or better, ASTM-D-3084(16).3.1.4 Method A-4, <T3>Direct Alpha Counting</T3> (Gross alpha determination). <T3>Principle:</T3> The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is countedwith an alpha counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorptionis not significant and the filter must be of such a nature that the particlesare retained on the surface. <T3>Applicability:</T3> Gross alpha determinations may be used to measureemissions of specific radionuclides only (1) when it is known that thesample contains only a single radionuclide, or the identity and isotopicratio of the radionuclides in the sample are well-known, (2) measurementsusing either Method A-1 or A-2 have shown that this method provides a reasonablyaccurate measurement of the emission rate, and (3) the effective dose equivalentfrom the emission does not exceed 10 percent of the applicable emissionstandard. Gross alpha measurements are applicable to mixtures of radionuclidesonly for the purposes described in section 3.7. APHA-601(3), ASTM-D-1943(10).3.1.5 Method A-5, <T3>Chemical Determination of Uranium.</T3> <T3>Principle: </T3>Uranium may be measured chemically by either colorimetryor fluorometry. In both procedures, the sample is dissolved, the uraniumis oxidized to the hexavalent form and extracted into hexone. Impuritiesare removed from the hexone layer. For colorimetry, dibenzoylmethane isadded, and the uranium is measured by the absorbance in a colorimeter.For fluorometry, a portion of the solution is fused with a sodium fluoride-lithiumfluoride flux and the uranium is determined by the ultraviolet activatedfluorescence of the fused disk in a fluorometer. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable to the measurements ofemission rates of uranium when the isotopic ratio of the uranium radionuclidesis well known. ASTM-E-318(15), ASTM-D-2907(14). 3.1.6 Method A-6, <T3>Radon-222_Continuous Gas Monitor.</T3> <T3>Principle: </T3>Radon-222 is measured directly in a continuously extractedsample stream by passing the air stream through a calibrated scintillationcell. Prior to the scintillation cell, the air stream is passed througha filter and if needed a desiccant to remove particulates and excess moisture.The alpha particles from radon-222 and its decay products strike a zincsulfide coating on the inside of the scintillation cell producing lightpulses. The light pulses are detected by a photomultiplier tube which generateselectrical pulses. These pulses are processed by the system electronicsand the read out is in pCi/1 of radon-222. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable to the measurement ofradon-222 in effluent streams which do not contain significant quantitiesof radon-222. Users of this method should calibrate the monitor in a radoncalibration chamber at lesat twice per year. The background of the monitorshould also be checked periodically by operating the instrument in a lowradon environment. EPA 520/1-86-04(24) 3.2 <T3>Methods of Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.</T3> 3.2.1 Method B-1, <T3>Direct Counting in Flow-Through Ionization Chambers.</T3> <T3>Principle: </T3>An ionization chamber containing a specific volumeof gas which flows at a given flow rate through the chamber is used. Thesample (effluent stream sample) acts as the counting gas for the chamber.The activity of the radionuclide is determined from the current measuredin the ionization chamber. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable for measuring the activityof a gaseous beta-emitting radionuclide that is suitable as a countinggas, when no other beta-emitting nuclides are present. DOE/EP-0096(17),NCRP-58(23). 3.2.2 Method B-2, <T3>Direct Counting in Flow-Through Chamber with Beta Detectors.</T3> A chamber of known volume which contains a Geiger-Muller tube or otherbeta detector is used. The effluent gas stream passes through the chamberat a given flow rate. The activity of the radionuclide is determined fromthe beta count rate. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is appropriate for measuring the activityof a gaseous beta-emitting radionuclide with a maximum energy greater than0.2MeV (beta-max) when no other beta-emitting nuclides are present. 3.3 <T3>Methods for Non-Gaseous Beta Emitting Radionuclides.</T3> 3.3.1 Method B-3, <T3>Radiochemistry-Beta Counting.</T3> <T3>Principle: </T3>The element of interest is separated from other elements,and from the sample matrix by radiochemistry. This may involve precipitation,distillation, ion exchange, or solvent extraction. Carriers (elements chemicallysimilar to the element of interest) may be used. The element is depositedon a planchet, and counted with a beta counter. Corrections for chemicalyield, and decay (if necessary) are made. The beta count rate determinesthe total activity of all radionuclides of the separated element. Thismethod may also involve the radiochemical separation and counting of adaughter element, after a suitable period of ingrowth, in which case itis specific for the parent nuclide. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable for measuring the activityof any beta-emitting radionuclide, with a maximum energy greater than 0.2MeV, provided no other radionuclide is present in the separated sample.APHA-608(5). 3.3.2. Method B-4, <T3>Direct Beta Counting</T3> (Gross beta determination). <T3>Principle: </T3>The sample, collected on a suitable filter, is countedwith a beta counter. The sample must be thin enough so that self-absorptioncorrections can be made. <T3>Applicability:</T3> Gross beta measurements are applicable only toradionuclides with maximum beta particle energies greater than 0.2 MeV.Gross beta measurements may be used to measure emissions of specific radionuclidesonly: (1) When it is known that the sample contains only a single nuclide,(2) measurements made using Method B-3 show reasonable agreement with thegross beta measurement and (3) the effective dose equivalent from the emissionsdoes not exceed 10% of the limits of the applicable standard. Gross betameasurements are applicable to mixtures of radionuclides only for the purposesdescribed in section 3.7. APHA-602(4), ASTM-D-1890(10). 3.3.3 Method B-5, <T3>Liquid Scintillation Spectrometry.</T3> <T3>Principle: </T3>An aliquot of a collected sample or the result of someother chemical separation or processing technique is added to a liquidscintillation ``cocktail'' which is viewed by photomultiplier tubes ina liquid scintillation spectrometer. The spectrometer is adjusted to establisha channel or ``window'' for the pulse energy appropriate to the nuclideof interest. The activity of the nuclide of interest is measured by thecounting rate in the appropriate energy channel. Corrections are made forchemical yield where separations are made. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable to any beta-emittingnuclide when no other radionuclide is present in the sample or the separatedsample provided that it can be incorporated in the scintillation cocktail.This method is also applicable for samples which contain more than oneradionuclide but only when the energies of the beta particles are sufficientlyseparated so that they can be resolved by the spectrometer. This methodis most applicable to the measurement of low-energy beta emitters suchas tritium and carbon-14. APHA-609(6), EML-LV-0539-17(19). 3.4 <T3>Gamma Emitting Radionuclides.</T3> 3.4.1 Method G-1, <T3>High Resolution Gamma Spectrometry.</T3> <T3>Principle: </T3>The sample is counted with a high resolution gammadetector, either a Ge(Li) or a high purity Ge detector, connected to amultichannel analyzer or computer. The gamma emitting radionuclides inthe sample are measured for the gamma count rates in the energy regionscharacteristic of the individual radionuclide. Corrections are made forcounts contributed by other radionuclides to the spectral regions of theradionuclides of interest. Radiochemical separations may be made priorto counting but are usually not necessary. <T3>Applicability:</T3> This method is applicable to the measurement ofany gamma emitting radionuclide with gamma energies greater than 20 kev.It can be applied to complex mixtures of radionuclides. The samples countedmay be in the form of particulate filters, absorbers, liquids or gases.The method may also be applied to the analysis of gaseous gamma emittingradionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing the stream througha chamber or cell containing the detector.

It is not applicable to mixturesof radionuclides. The samples counted may be in the form of particulatefilters, absorbers, liquids or gas. The method can be applied to the analysisof gaseous radionuclides directly in an effluent stream by passing thegas stream through a chamber or cell containing the detector. 3.5 <T3>Counting methods.</T3> All of the above methods with the exceptionof Method A-5 involve counting the radiation emitted by the radionuclide.Counting methods applicable to the measurement of alpha, beta and gammaradiations are listed below.

Radon-222 Emissions From Uranium Mill Tailings Piles 2.1 Measurement and Calculation of the Mean Radon Flux. 2.1.1 <T3>Frequency of Flux Measurements. </T3>Radon flux measurements shallbe performed on uranium mill tailings piles after disposal as describedbelow. Additional measurements shall be performed at any time if the coveron the pile is disturbed or erodes in a manner that could cause a significantincrease of the mean radon flux of the pile. 2.1.2 <T3>Distribution and Number of Flux Measurements. </T3>Radon flux measurementsshall be made at approximately regularly spaced locations over the surfaceof the tailings pile. The minimum number of radon flux measurements requiredto determine the mean flux is 100 or two per acre whichever is smaller.2.1.3 <T3>Restrictions to Radon Flux Measurements. </T3>The following restrictionsare placed on making radon flux measurements: (a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.(b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24-hour measurement period, the measurementis invalid if the seal has washed away or if the collector is surroundedby water. (c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below35anddegrees;F or if the ground is frozen.2.1.4 <T3>Radon Flux Measurements. </T3>Measuring radon flux involves the adsorptionof radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector. The radon collectoris placed on the surface of the tailings pile area to be measured and allowedto collect radon for a time period of 24 hours. The radon collected onthe charcoal is measured by gamma-ray spectroscopy. The detailed measurementprocedure provided in Appendix A of EPA 520/5-85-029(1) shall be used tomeasure the radon flux on the tailings piles, except the surface of thetailings pile cover shall not be penetrated by the lip of the collectoras directed in the procedure, rather the collector shall be carefully positionedon a flat surface with soil or fine sand, containing no more than backgroundquantities of radium-226, used to seal the edge. 2.1.5 <T3>Calculations. </T3>The radon flux calculations shall be made as providedin Appendix A of reference EPA86(1). The mean radon flux for the uraniummill tailings pile shall be calculated by summing all individual flux measurementsand dividing by the total number of flux measurements.2.1.6 <T3>Reporting. </T3>The results of individual flux measurements, the approximatemeasurement locations on the tailings pile, and the mean radon flux shallbe included in the emission test report. Any condition or unusual eventthat occurred during the measurements that could significantly affect theresults shall also be reported. 3.0 Radon-222 Emissions From Phosphogypsum Stacks 3.1 Measurement and Calculation of the Mean Radon Flux. Radon flux measurementsshall be made on phosphogypsum stacks as described below:3.1.1 <T3>Distribution and number of flux measurements. </T3>The distributionand number of radon flux measurements required on a stack will depend onclearly defined areas of the stack (called regions) that can have significantlydifferent radon fluxes due to surface conditions. The mean radon flux shallbe determined for each individual region of the stack. Regions that shallbe considered are:(a) Water covered areas,(b) Water saturated areas (beaches),(c) Loose and dry top surface areas,(d) Hard-packed roadways, and(e) Sides.3.1.2 <T3>Number of flux measurements. </T3>Radon flux measurements shall bemade within each region on the phosphogypsum stack, except for those areascovered with water. Measurements shall be made at regularly spaced locationsacross the surface of the region, realizing that surface roughness willprohibit measurements in some areas of a region. The minimum number offlux measurements considered necessary to determine a representative meanradon flux value for each type of region is:(a) Water covered area_no measurements required as radon flux is assumedto be zero,(b) Water saturated beaches_50 radon flux measurements,(c) Loose and dry top surface_100 radon flux measurements,(d) Hard-packed roadways_50 radon flux measurements, and(e) Sides_100 radon flux measurements.A minimum of 300 measurements are required. A stack that has no water covercan be considered to consist of two regions, top and sides, and will requirea minimum of only 200 measurements.3.1.3 <T3>Restrictions to radon flux measurements. </T3>The following restrictionsare placed on making radon flux measurements:(a) Measurements shall not be initiated within 24 hours of a rainfall.(b) If a rainfall occurs during the 24 hour measurement period, the measurementis invalid if the seal around the lip of the collector has washed awayor if the collector is surrounded by water.(c) Measurements shall not be performed if the ambient temperature is below35anddegrees;F if the ground is frozen.3.1.4 <T3>Areas of stack regions. </T3>The approximate area of each region ofthe stack shall be determined in units of square meters.3.1.5 <T3>Radon flux measurements. </T3>Measuring radon flux involves the adsorptionof radon on activated charcoal in a large-area collector.

Purpose and BackgroundFacility owners or operators may estimate radionuclide emissions to theatmosphere for dose calculations instead of measuring emissions. Particulateemissions from mill tailing piles should be estimated using the procedureslisted in reference andplusmin;2. All other emissions may be estimated byusing the ``Procedures'' listed below, or using the method described inreference andplusmin;1.2. ProcedureTo estimate emissions to the atmosphere:(a) Determine the amount (in curies) used at facilities for the periodunder consideration. Radioactive materials in sealed packages that remainunopened, and have not leaked during the assessment period should not beincluded in the calculation.(b) Multiply the amount used by the following factors which depend on thephysical state of the radionuclide. They are:(i) 1 for gases;(ii) ^3 for liquids or particulate solids; and(iii) 10^6 for solids.If any nuclide is heated to a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or more,boils at a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius or less, or is intentionallydispersed into the environment, it must be considered to be a gas.(c) If a control device is installed between the place of use and the pointof release, multiply emissions from (b) by an adjustment factor.

Purpose and Background This Appendix provides simplified procedures to reduce the burden on NuclearRegulatory Commission (NRC) licensees, and non-Department of Energy Federalfacilities in determining compliance with 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart I. Theprocedures consist of a series of increasingly more stringent steps, dependingon the facility's potential to exceed the standard. First, a facility can be found in compliance if the quantity of radioactivematerial possessed during the year is less than that listed in a tableof annual possession quantities. A facility will also be in complianceif the average annual radionuclide emission concentration is less thanthat listed in a table of air concentration levels. If the facility isnot in compliance by these tables, it can establish compliance by estimatinga dose using screening procedure developed by the National Council on RadiationProtection and Measurements with a radiological source term derived usingEPA approved emission factors. These procedures are described in a ``Guidefor Determining Compliance with the Clean Air Act Standards for RadionuclideEmissions From NRC-Licensed and Non-DOE Federal Facilities.'' A user-friendly computer program called COMPLY has been developed to reducethe burden on the regulated community. The Agency has also prepared a ``User'sGuide for the COMPLY Code'' to assist the regulated community in usingthe code, and in handling more complex situations such as multiple releasepoints. The basis for these compliance procedures are provided in ``BackgroundInformation Document: Procedures Approved for Demonstrating Compliancewith 40 CFR Part 61, Subpart I''. The compliance model is the highest levelin the COMPLY computer code and provides for the most realistic assessmentof dose by allowing the use of site-specific information. 2. Table of Annual Possession Quantity. (a) Table 1 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliancewith the standard. The possession table can only be used if the followingconditions are met: (i) No person lives within 10 meters of any release point; and (ii) No milk, meat, or vegetables are produced within 100 meters of anyrelease point. (b) All restrictions on selecting the physical state of the radionuclidefrom section 61.103 apply to section 61.104. (c) If the quantity of anyradionuclide possessed annually is less than the value listed in Table1, the facility is in a compliance. If a facility uses multiple radionuclides,and the sum of the amount of each used annually divided by the limit fromTable 1 is less than unity, then the facility is in compliance.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table 1._Annual Possession Quantities for Environmental Compliance</T4><H1>Radionuclide</H1><H1>Annual possession quantities (Ci/yr)</H1><H2>Gaseous \1\ form</H2><H2>Liquid/powder form</H2><H2>Solid form</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">Ag-110m<D>8E-05</D><D>8E-02</D><D>8E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Am-241<D>2E-07</D><D>2E-04</D><D>2E-01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ar-41<D>1E+00</D><D>E</D><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Au-198<D>4E-02</D><D>4E+01</D><D>4E-04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ba-140<D>2E-03</D><D>2E+00</D><D>2E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C-14<D>3E-01</D><D>3E+02</D><D>3E+05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ce-144<D>1E-03</D><D>1E+00</D><D>1E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cm-244<D>3E-06</D><D>3E-03</D><D>3E+00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Co-60<D>1E-05</D><D>1E-02</D><D>1E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cr-51<D>5E-02</D><D>5E+01</D><D>5E+04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cs-134<D>4E-05</D><D>4E-02</D><D>4E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cs-137<D>2E-05</D><D>2E-02</D><D>2E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Eu-154<D>1E-05</D><D>1E-02</D><D>1E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fe-59<D>1E-03</D><D>1E+00</D><D>1E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ga-67<D>1E-01</D><D>1E+02</D><D>1E+05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gd-152<D>1E-06</D><D>1E-03</D><D>1E+00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">H-3<D>8E+00</D><D>8E+03</D><D>8E+06</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hf-181<D>2E-03</D><D>2E+00</D><D>2E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hg-197<D>2E-01</D><D>2E+02</D><D>2E+05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hg-203<D>4E-03</D><D>4E+00</D><D>4E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I-123<D>4E-01</D><D>4E+02</D><D>4E+05</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I-125<D>5E-03</D><D>5E+00</D><D>5E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I-131<D>6E-03</D><D>6E+00</D><D>6E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">In-113m<D>2E+00</D><D>2E+03</D><D>2E+06</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ir-192<D>8E-04</D><D>8E-01</D><D>8E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K-40<D>6E-05</D><D>6E-02</D><D>6E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kr-83m<D>7E+03</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kr-85<D>5E+02</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kr-85m<D>9E+00</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kr-87<D>2E+00</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mn-54<D>2E-04</D><D>2E-01</D><D>2E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mo-99 \2\<D>7E-02</D><D>7E+01</D><D>7E-04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Na-24<D>2E-02</D><D>2E+01</D><D>2E+04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nb-95<D>2E-03</D><D>2E+00</D><D>2E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ni-63<D>3E-01</D><D>3E+02</D><D>3E+05</D><F>\1\ Radionuclides boiling at 100 anddegrees;C or less, or exposed to atemperature of 100 anddegrees;C or more, must be considered to be a gas.</F><F>\2\ Mo-99 contained in a generator to produce technetium-99 can be assumedto be a solid.</F></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,9,9,9</C><T4>Table 1._Annual Possession Quantities for Environmental Compliance(continued)</T4><H1>Radionuclide</H1><H1>Annual possession quantities (Cr/yr)</H1><H2>Gaseous form \1\</H2><H2>Liquid powder form</H2><H2>Solid form</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">P-32<D>5E-03</D><D>5E+00</D><D>5E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pb-210<D>5E-05</D><D>5E-02</D><D>5E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Po-210<D>9E-05</D><D>9E-02</D><D>9E+01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ru-103<D>3E-03</D><D>3E+00</D><D>3E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">S-35<D>3E-02</D><D>3E+00</D><D>3E+04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sb-124<D>5E-04</D><D>5E-01</D><D>5E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sc-46<D>3E-04</D><D>3E-01</D><D>3E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Se-75<D>1E-03</D><D>1E+00</D><D>1E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sn-113<D>2E-03</D><D>2E+00</D><D>2E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sr-85<D>2E-03</D><D>2E+00</D><D>2E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Sr-90<D>8E-04</D><D>8E-01</D><D>8E+02</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tc-95m<D>1E-03</D><D>1E+00</D><D>1E+03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tc-99m<D>1E+00</D><D>1E+03</D><D>1E+06</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">W-187<D>9E-02</D><D>9E+01</D><D>9E+04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xe-133<D>4E+01</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xe-133m<D>5E+01</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Xe-135<D>6E-00</D><D/><D/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Zn-65<D>3E-04-</D><D>3E-01</D><D>3E+02</D><F>\1\ Radionuclides boiling at 100 anddegrees;C or less, or exposed to atemperature of 100 anddegrees;C or more, must be considered to be a gas.</F></ITAG></ITAG>3. Table of Concentration Levels(a) Table 2 may be used for determining if facilities are in compliancewith the standard.1. The concentration table can only be used if all releases are from pointsources and concentrations have been measured using EPA-approved methods,and the distance between each stack or vent and the nearest resident isgreater than 3 times the diameter of the stack or vent.2. If the concentration of any radionuclide released from the facilityis less than the value listed in Table 2, the facility is in compliance.If a facility releases multiple radionuclides, and the sum of the concentrationof each radionuclide divided by its limiting concentration from Table 2is less than unity, then the facility is in compliance.4. NCRP Screening ModelThe procedures described in National Council on Radiation Protection andMeasurement Commentary No. 3 ``Screening Techniques for Determining Compliancewith Environmental Standards'' may be used to determine the dose to membersof the general public from emissions of radionuclides to the atmosphere.5. The COMPLY Computer CodeThe COMPLY computer code may be used to determine compliance with SubpartI. The compliance model in the COMPLY computer code may be used to determinethe dose to members of the general public from emissions of radionuclidesto the atmosphere. The compliance model contains more radionuclides thanthe current version of NCRP Commentary No. 3.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s10,4-4,r10,4-4</C><T4>Table </T4>2._<T4>Concentration Levels for Environmental Compliance</T4><H1>Radionuclide</H1><H1>Concentration (Ci/m\3\)</H1><H1>Radionuclide</H1><H1>  Concentration (Ci/m\3\)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Ag-110m<D>7E-14</D><D>Kr-85</D><D>7E-07</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Am-241<D>2E-15</D><D>Kr-85m</D><D>1E-08</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ar-41<D>1E-09</D><D>Kr-87</D><D>3E-09</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Au-198<D>1E-11</D><D>Mn-54</D><D>2E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ba-140<D>1E-12</D><D>Mo-99</D><D>8E-12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">C-14<D>4E-12</D><D>Na-24</D><D>2E-11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ce-144<D>7E-13</D><D>Nb-95</D><D>2E-12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cm-244<D>4E-15</D><D>Ni-63</D><D>1E-11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Co-60<D>2E-14</D><D>P-32</D><D>7E-14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cr-51<D>5E-11</D><D>Pb-210</D><D>3E-15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cs-134<D>2E-14</D><D>Po-210</D><D>8E-15</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cs-137<D>2E-14</D><D>Ru-103</D><D>2E-12</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Eu-154<D>2E-14</D><D>S-35</D><D>5E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fe-59<D>8E-13</D><D>Sb-124</D><D>4E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ga-67<D>8E-11</D><D>Sc-46</D><D>4E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Gd-152<D>2E-14</D><D>Se-75</D><D>4E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">H-3<D>4E-09</D><D>Sn-113</D><D>5E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hf-181<D>2E-12</D><D>Sr-85</D><D>8E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hg-197<D>2E-11</D><D>Sr-90</D><D>2E-14</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hg-203<D>9E-14</D><D>Tc-95m</D><D>1E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I-123<D>5E-10</D><D>Tc-99</D><D>2E-13</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I-125<D>9E-14</D><D>Tc-99m</D><D>2E-9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I-131<D>3E-9</D><D>W-187</D><D>2E-11</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">In-113m<D>3E-09</D><D>Xe-133</D><D>5E-8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ir-192<D>8E-13</D><D>Xe-133m</D><D>7E-9</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">K-40<D>3E-14</D><D>Xe-135</D><D>1E-8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kr-83m<D>9E-06</D><D>Zn-65</D><D>7E-14</D></ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">6.
