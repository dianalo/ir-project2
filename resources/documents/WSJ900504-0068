If all 13 members of the Organization of PetroleumCountries conscientiously honor their promises, they'dessentially wipe out the full amount of OPEC's recentover-ceiling production, which is blamed for most of the 25%drop in world oil prices this year.</LP><TEXT>   Even if they don't, substantial compliance with theunanimous agreement could at least ease the current oil glut.   The development, nevertheless, was greeted with skepticismin oil markets. Despite the fact that the mere scheduling ofthe session had halted a worsening price slide in late April,prices fell yesterday on reports of the agreement. The Junecontract for West Texas Intermediate crude dropped 69 centsto $17.99 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.   The accord came early on the second day of the emergencytalks here, in keeping with the ministers' hopes for adisplay of swift and decisive action. They have reasoned thatoil markets would be calmed by a brief and controversy-freemeeting. Ironically, the session was OPEC's first in sometime at which ministers had to address sharing output cuts,rather than increases.   Puzzled by the new price declines, the oil ministers stillheld that their intent to reduce sharply the flow of oilwould eventually restore stability to volatile markets andfirm up prices.   &quot;Prices will definitely improve; I'm willing to put mymoney on it,&quot; Ginandjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oilminister, said in an interview.   With the agreement calling for each country to make acontribution, OPEC calculated the overall reduction at1,445,000 barrels a day. That would bring production down to22,055,000 barrels a day from April's estimated 23.5 millionbarrels a day, and would make it about equal to theorganization's widely ignored first-half ceiling.   The pledged cuts are effective for the months of May, Juneand July. The idea is to remove enough oil -- at least onemillion barrels a day -- from a glutted market to stabilizeprices until OPEC is beyond the current quarter, which hasbeen characterized by sluggish oil demand. During the thirdquarter, world-wide use of petroleum generally begins torise.   Pressure at the meeting for output reductions fell mostheavily on big overproducers such as Saudi Arabia, Kuwait andthe United Arab Emirates. Both Saudi Arabia and Kuwaitobligated themselves to cut back to their quotas of 5.4million and 1.5 million barrels a day, respectively.According to working figures used by other oil ministers incalculating total reductions, that suggests cuts of 430,000barrels a day for Saudi Arabia and 400,000 barrels a day forKuwait from recent actual rates.   The United Arab Emirates, which had been flatly refusingto recognize its quota in any manner, in effect rejoined OPECby agreeing to participate in the cutback plan. Mana SaidOtaiba, the UAE oil minister, told reporters: &quot;We areproducing 2.1 million {barrels a day}. We promise to cut200,000 {barrels a day}. So we will produce 1.9 million untilthe end of July.&quot;   Some questions arose about previous promises made by theministers of Kuwait and UAE, both chronic quota violators.OPEC sources said Ali Khalifa Al-Sabah of Kuwait wouldn'taccept a cutback here unless the UAE dropped down at least300,000 barrels a day and other overproducers also returnedto their quota limits.   Mr. Otaiba was finally pushed to the point that he askedhis government for permission to cut, but only by 200,000barrels.   To salvage what seemed to be a shaky situation, Mr.Ginandjar, the Indonesian minister, then proposed trimmingIndonesia's production by 40,000 barrels a day, even thoughit isn't currently producing its full quota.   Other volunteers also chipped in to help offset the UAE's&quot;missing&quot; 100,000 barrels and satisfy Kuwait. At one timeduring tense negotiations that went into the morning, theIranian and Iraqi ministers returned from a privateconference to offer cuts of 20,000 barrels a day each. Bothcountries, like Indonesia, are also producing under-quota.   &quot;The principle is that everybody participates, no matterhow small,&quot; said OPEC's Secretary-General Subroto.   The marketplace actually may have already accomplishedsome of the cuts OPEC is counting. Members' sales of crudeoil recently have slackened, because buyers' storagefacilities are filled to their brims. By one estimate, OPEC'soutput already has dropped as much as 500,000 barrels a dayfrom April's 23.5 million average.   Still, some ministers suggested that &quot;real&quot; cuts of aroundone million barrels a day would soon be evident in the oilmarkets. &quot;That should be enough,&quot; said one.   Sadek Boussena, Algeria's oil minister and acting OPECpresident, disclosed that OPEC's next ministerial conferencewas postponed to July 25 from a June date. At that meeting,OPEC will determine production levels and country quotas forthe remainder of the year. By then, he said, demand forOPEC's oil should be increasing again. &quot;Some forecasts arethat it could be at least 24 million {barrels a day} in thefourth quarter,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
