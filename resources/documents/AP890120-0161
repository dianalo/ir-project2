Foreign Minister Miguel D'Escoto called John Leonard, charged'affaires for the U.S. Embassy here, just as President Bush wasbeing inaugurated to tell him Nicaragua will begin immediatelyissuing visas for U.S. diplomats.   After a 90-minute meeting with Leonard, D'Escoto told reportersthat ``today's decision was a very generous measure'' by theSandinista government.   ``It is a unilateral decision (designed) to normalize bilateralrelations with mutual respect,'' he said.   The leftist government also waived a 15-day waiting period forvisas.   Leonard told reporters the new administration ``is going toconsider'' the decision before commenting on it. ``We are going tosee what our (visa) needs are,'' he said.   The gestures are believed to be the first conciliatory overtureby either country toward the other since former Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz visited Managua 4{ years ago.   Relations between Nicaragua and the United States were strainedthroughout the Reagan administration because of U.S. support for theanti-Sandinista rebels known as Contras.   The Nicaraguan gesture comes during uncertainty about what policythe Bush administration plans for Nicaragua. Secretary ofState-designate James Baker said during his confirmation hearingslast week that he will attempt to forge a bipartisan policy on thatissue but gave no details.   Congress suspended aid to the Contras in February over strenuousReagan administration objections. The Bush administration has givenno indication it plans to seek to resume such aid.   The U.S.-Nicaraguan conflict over accrediting diplomats datesback to July 11, when Nicaragua ordered home U.S. Ambassador RichardMelton and seven other U.S. envoys on grounds they were interferingin Nicaragua's internal affairs.   The United States retaliated by expelling eight Nicaraguan envoysfrom Washington, including Ambassador Carlos Tunnermann.   When the State Department submitted a list of envoys toSandinista authorities as replacements for the expelled diplomats,Nicaragua refused to give them visas.   The Sandinistas contended that the United States had acted beyondits authority in expelling Tunnermann, who served both as ambassadorto the U.S. and to the Organization of American States.   Sandinista officials contended that the State Department had noright to expel an envoy accredited to an international organization.   Subsequently, the Sandinistas refused to allow the remaining U.S.diplomats in Nicaragua the right to return immediately when theyleft the country either on official or personal business.   Instead, the Sandinistas insisted on a waiting period of 15working days.</TEXT></DOC>
