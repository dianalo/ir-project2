A Fireflysystem consists of from one to nine VLSI VAX processors, each with afloating point accelerator and a cache. The caches are coherent, so thatall processors see a consistent view of main memory. The Firefly runsa software system that emulates the Ultrix system call interface, andin addition provides support for multiprocessing through multiple threadsof control in a single address space. Communication is provided uniformlythrough the use of remote procedure call. The authors describe the goals,hardware, software system, and performance of the Firefly, and discussthe extent to which SRC has been successful in providing software totake advantage of multi-processing.</TEXT></DOC>
