The dollar closed at 122.15 yen, up 0.15 yen from Monday's closeof 122.00 yen. Opening higher at 122.50 yen, the currency fellslowly but steadily while ranging between 122.00 yen and 122.51 yen.   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 380.27-pointloser the previous day, regained 334.98 points or 1.2 percent tomove back to 29,318.30. The index gained 79.53 points shortly afterthe market opened and rose markedly during the afternoon session.   The dollar's rise in Tokyo followed an advance in New York thatdealers attributed to the increase in the U.S. prime interest rateand to an agreement by members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries to reduce crude production.   Major U.S. banks boosted their prime lending rates by a halfpercentage point to 10.5 percent, the fourth increase this year.Higher U.S. interest rates increase the attractiveness ofdollar-denominated investments.   OPEC agreed Monday to set a daily production quota of 18.5million barrels, down from its estimated 22.5 million-barrel currentproduction, and a target price of $18 a barrel. The announcementtriggered $1 a barrel increases in oil markets.   Oil generally is priced in dollars, and higher OPEC prices raisedemand for dollars to pay for the oil.   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa called the effect of the OPECagreement on exchange rates mostly psychological, and said the pactwould not have an immediate effect on the world economy.   An exchange dealer with the Bank of Tokyo said he did not expectany heavy dollar-selling in the market before the release of U.S.unemployment figures, due out Friday in Washington.   ``The market bearishness toward the dollar remains, but dealerswere reluctant to sell further until they see the figures,'' hesaid, speaking on condition of anonymity.   The Nikkei Stock Average finished the morning session at29,051.30, up 67.98 points from Monday's close. On Monday, the indexfell 380.27 points to close below the 29,000-point mark for thefirst time since Nov. 16.   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, many institutional investors stayedon the sidelines watching movements in overseas markets ahead of theupcoming release of U.S. gross national product and unemploymentfigures, dealers said.   Estimated U.S. GNP statistics for the July-September quarter werescheduled for release later Tuesday in Washington.</TEXT></DOC>
