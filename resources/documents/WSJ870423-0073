HilderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/23/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FINEARNINGS (ERN)BANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America, parent of the nation's largest thrift, said first-quarter net income fell 81%, largely because it tripled its provision for losses on loans and real estate.    As expected, Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. said it had an operating loss for the quarter, which was more than offset by larger gains on the sale of mortgage-backed securities and loans.    The problem loan portfolio of Financial Corp.'s major unit, American Savings andamp; Loan Association, has been a significant burden on the company's earnings since 1984. The latest quarter's provision for losses on loans and real estate of $79.8 million, compared with $25.4 million a year earlier, indicates that Financial Corp. is continuing to use gains in its securities portfolio to offset loan-loss charges.    Net in the first quarter was $9.2 million, or 17 cents a share, compared with $49.1 million, or $1.21 a share, a year earlier. Net reflected gains on sales of mortgage-backed securities and loans of $109 million, up 27% from $85.5 million a year earlier.    Financial Corp.'s first-quarter operating loss widened to $17.3 million from $7.3 million. William J. Popejoy, chairman, said in an interview, &quot;We hope to be able to correct (the operating loss) over the year.&quot; He said the operating loss was caused by lower yields on its $17.74 billion mortgage-backed securities portfolio and on loans that were renegotiated during 1986 and early 1987.    Financial Corp. said the sharply higher loss provision was caused by &quot;further deterioration of real estate markets in the oilpatch areas&quot; and falling values in various commercial real estate markets.    Mr. Popejoy declined to estimate future loss provisions. &quot;That would be just a nonproductive exercise,&quot; he said. However, he said the company hopes that some funds set aside as reserves won't be needed to cover losses because Financial Corp. eventually will be able to sell some properties at higher prices than their current depressed values dictate.    Some commercial properties that Financial Corp. owns in Texas, Mr. Popejoy said, recently have been appraised at $20 a square foot while construction costs are about $100 a square foot.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Financial Corp. closed at $6.625 a share, down 12.5 cents.    Financial Corp.'s reserve for losses on loans and real estate increased 49% to $854 million at March 31 from $572 million a year earlier and $800 million at Dec. 31. Scheduled items, which are delinquent loans and foreclosed real estate minus reserves for possible losses, fell to $1.68 billion, or 5% of assets at March 31, from $1.85 billion, or 7% of assets a year earlier.    Assets increased 28% to $33.86 billion at March 31 from $26.44 billion a year earlier. Assets fell slightly from the year-end level of $33.95 billion.    Mr. Popejoy again defended his strategy of increasing Financial Corp.'s holdings of fixed-rate, mortgage-backed securities. He noted that the company realized $964 million of gains on the portfolio in the last six quarters.    Mr. Popejoy also noted that Financial Corp.'s one-year gap, a measure of interest-rate risk, fell to 24% at March 31 from 52% a year earlier, and 25% at Dec. 31. The one-year gap is the excess of liabilities that change interest rates in one year or less over the amount of assets that change rates in the same time, expressed as a percentage of assets.    The lower gap is largely the result of hedging transactions that extend the maturities of many of Financial Corp.'s borrowings from less than one year to between one and three years.    The capital of American Savings, figured under regulatory accounting, increased to $560.9 million, or 1.69% of liabilities at March 31, from $506.5 million, or 1.95% of liabilities, a year earlier. The level remains about $1.1 billion below the required level of 4% of liabilities.    Mr. Popejoy said that Financial Corp. and federal regulators are seeking a buyer or capital contributor for the company, but said that in the past two years, &quot;No entity has stepped forward with a serious proposal.&quot;    Allan G. Bortel, who follows the thrift industry for Shearson Lehman Brothers, said that it &quot;continues to be disturbing that (Financial Corp.) is taking such large loss reserves.&quot; He noted that other savings and loan companies have been reporting reserves smaller than Financial Corp. He also said that the gains on mortgage-backed securities and loans &quot;will be a difficult figure to reproduce&quot; in later quarters. </TEXT></DOC>
