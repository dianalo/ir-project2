(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   George Bush, getting in a last round offishing before becoming president, regaled reporters Saturday withhis account of landing a 13-pound fighting bonefish the day before.   He said he even got a photograph.   The fishing ``really is excellent, just wonderful,'' Bush toldreporters watching his party depart from a private dock before 8 a.m.   Bush caught no bonefish Saturday although he pulled in 25 smallerfish. He came back after nearly 10 hours on the water saying windyconditions had hampered the fishing.   Bush caught seven different types of fish _ ladyfish, snapper,jack, perch, trout, catfish and a two-foot shark _ and all werethrown back.   Perhaps the most interesting catch of the day was by Bush buddyFred Zeder, the former ambassador to Micronesia, who snagged aseagull as he was trying to cast his line. The gull bobbed aroundlike a kite but soon was reeled in, unsnagged and flew off.   The president-elect said work, including preparation of hisspeech for Friday's inaugural, could wait until he returned toWashington Sunday.   However, Bush's transition office in Washington announced severalappointments, including David C. Mulford as under secretary of theTreasury for international Affairs, and Anna Maria Perez as BarbaraBush's press secretary.   When a tourist perched on an adjacent pier told Bush she was fromEngland, he asked puckishly, ``Think (Prime Minister) MargaretThatcher would like a little of this bonefishing action?''   Bush, fishing off a 17-foot skiff in shallow waters, said hereeled in a 13-pound bonefish Friday after it stripped off 150 yardsof line. After weighing it, Bush said he threw the fish back in.   ``We got a picture, word of honor,'' said Bush, producing theroll of film and instructing an aide to ``release it if it looksgood.''   The vice president, on his third fishing or hunting trip sincehis election, said, ``These are, pound for pound, I'd say, asfighting a fish as there is in the world.   ``It really is amazing what they do,'' continued Bush. ``Then youtake them in, weigh them and hold them in the water and stroke themso that they can escape without some shark getting them. It reallyis very wonderful.''   ``Senator Simpson caught a good-sized redfish ... about 10 or 12or 13 pounds also,'' said Bush.   Alan Simpson, the Republican senator from Wyoming, added a fewembellishments.   ``You can't keep up with him. We had fish all over the place. Icaught a redfish. He caught a bonefish. My redfish was one of thelargest ever caught in these particular waters,'' said Simpson.   Bush rolled his eyes. ``I didn't point out I have to put up withthis all day long out there,'' he said.   Bush used an 8-pound test line to reel in his catch Friday, whichhe called the ``sporting'' thing to do. ``There's no machine reelingthem in,'' he said.   This is Bush's fifth trip since 1980 to this resort halfway downthe Keys, but he deflated local boosters' hopes Friday when he saidhe will not establish a winter White House here or anyplace else.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was also fishing with Bush,but no work was on the agenda.   Asked if he would steal some time to work on the inauguralspeech, Bush said, ``Tomorrow night I start. I've already started,but not here. When I get back we'll get to seriousness on that.''   Mulford has been an assistant Treasury secretary since 1984.Perez is now press secretary to Rep. John Miller, R-Wash.   Three other Treasury jobs were announced: Edith E. Holiday forgeneral counsel, Charles H. Dallara, assistant secretary forinternational affairs, and Hollis S. McLoughlin, assistant secretaryfor policy development. Holiday and Dallara are now Treasuryofficials. McLoughlin, a former Purolator Courier Corp. executive,was Brady's chief of staff as a U.S. senator from New Jersey in 1982.   The transition office also said Susan Porter Rose will remainMrs. Bush's chief of staff, as expected. Another aide, LaurieFirestone will be the first lady's social secretary and a formeraide, Julie Cooke, her director of projects.   On Monday, Bush will observe Martin Luther King's birthday byspeaking at a black group's prayer breakfast in Washington, aideStephen Hart said.</TEXT></DOC>
