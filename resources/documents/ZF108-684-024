 The cuts apply to the US only, and IBM UK saysthat the although the market is restricted largely to banks, the 4576 isstill a strategic product.andP;  As from July 3, the 4576 number 1591 with 8Mb ofmemory costs $21,000, down from $33,570.andP;  The 1592 with 16Mb, and 1593 with32Mb are $42,000 and $84,000 respectively, reduced from $67,150 and $134,500.andO;Conversion from the 1591 to 1592 is $21,000, formerly $33,580.andP;  The 1592 to1593 is $63,000, down from $86,830, and the 1591 to 1593 is $73,500, reducedfrom $108,150.andM;Linkway 2.00 version of the object- oriented developmentandM;languageandM;LinkWay Version 2.00 is an application development language that enablesusers to create, present and modify applications containing text, pictures,video images and sound.andP;  Version 1 was launched in the UK last July (CI No1,214), and IBM says that this version has VGA graphics, an enhanced paintprogram, improved text editors and a full function script language.andP;  It isavailable either as a single or local area network package from August 3 inthe US.andP;  The script language enables users to express functions with asubroutine capability and provides a user interface.andP;  A new type of textbutton, the reference button, enables users to navigate through a hypertextspace, and the paint program produces pictures without using additionaltools.andP;  Memory requirements for objects have been reduced, and provisions aremade for the use of extended memory.andP;  The mouse-based point and shootinterface is said to make production of new applications easier, and thesubroutine facility enables application designers to share functions.andO;Version 2.00 is upward-compatible from LinkWay 1.00 and 1.01.andP;  Version 2.00contains conversion routines that exchange images with Storyboard Plus andcan increase the library of pictures and scanned images available.andP;  LinkWayVersion 2.00 operates with the following configurations.andP;  PS/2 models require512Kb memory, a PS/2 mouse, one disk drive plus an additional disk drive, andIBM recommends a fixed disk or local area network connection along withadditional 128Kb memory.andP;  The Personal Computer, Portable Personal Computer,and XT or AT require 512Kb memory, a Microsoft mouse or compatible, graphicdisplay, and two disk drives or a fixed disk or a local area networkconnection.andP;  Again, a fixed disk or local area network connection along withan additional 128Kb memory are recommended.andP;  The PC Convertible needs 512Kbmemory, a Microsoft mouse or compatible, and a colour display.andP;  A singleLinkway pack contains a Program License Agreement, and two 3.5&quot; 1Mb disks,and can only be used on one machine at any one time.andP;  The Local Area NetworkPack has the same contents as the Single Pack, and it may used on up to 50machines concurrently under the control of a local area network program.andO;However, Local Area Network Pack licences are available only to customerswith an Educational Allowance Amendment in effect.andP;  The Linkway Single Packcosts $140 and the Local Area Network Package is $980.andP;  Upgrades are $70 and$250 respectively.andM;Automated Operations Control for MVSandM;Automated Operations Control/MVS - AOC/MVS - is a systems management productfor automating console operator functions.andP;  A NetView application, itsupports single and multisystem MVS environments and replaces the ACOSolutionPac.andP;  Functions include automated responses for console messages,policy implementation and management, operator usability dialogues, areal-time data store for automation information, and interfaces forinstallation developed procedures.andP;  It provides drop-in procedures, fullscreen menus, has AOC/MVS panels and uses Interactive System ProductivityFacility.andP;  AOC/MVS procedures manage MVS, JES, TSO, VTAM, and ResourceMeasurement Facility.andP;  The procedures can start, recover, monitor/restart andshutdown other subsystems.andP;  Message Automation procedures can be invoked whenspecified messages occur and AOC/MVS will automatically invoke installationrecovery procedures.andP;  It provides support for SYSLOG, LOGREC, SMF and MVSDump data sets.andP;  AOC/MVS will inquire about the status of Buffers, JES2 spooland JES3 spool.andP;  When an installation defined threshold is reached, recoveryactions are automatically executed.andP;  Other services that provide support forAOC/MVS automation and installation procedures include Automation ControlFile, Automation Status File, and Automation Timer Support.andP;  AOC/MVS controlsthe initialisation, start, recovery and shutdown, and restart of resources,and it controls automation for the focal point and monitors the status ofeach remote system using the Status Display Facility.andP;  AOC/MVS runs as anapplication under NetView Version 1 Release 3.andP;  Costs range between $10,800for group 18 and $84,000 for group 60.andP;  The Distributed System Licence Optionstarts at $8,100 and rises to $63,000.andP;  Basic monthly licences are from $225to $1,750, and the distributed option ranges between $168 and $1,312.andP;  Itwill be available in the US on February 15, 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
