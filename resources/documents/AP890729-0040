Delegates from 130 universities are attending the organization'sfounding conference, which will wind up Sunday. Thousands ofChinese students who were studying abroad when the governmentcrushed the student democracy movement in Beijing and other citieshave decided not to return home.   Wu'er, 21, who fled China after the military crackdown there inJune, told the crowd to continue the battle for democracy. ``Wecan't rely on begging or wait for a next time,'' he said. ``We musttry now!''   Behind him, a plaster replica of the Goddess of Democracyerected by Chinese protesters in Beijing overlooked the crowd,which cheered and stamped their feet as Wu'er shouted pro-democracyslogans.   The original Goddess, fashioned after the Statue of Liberty, wastorn down by the Chinese government after the military crushed thestudent democracy movement that had occupied Tiananmen Square.   The students dismissed the Communist Party's announcement Fridaythat it was reining in corruption and nepotism. The party shut downtwo state-owned conglomerates, including one linked to seniorleader Deng Xiaoping's son, and ordered an end to many of thespecial privileges enjoyed by high officials.   The Politburo order clearly was a response to the studentmovement, which struck a deep chord among hundreds of thousands ofChinese with its criticism of official corruption.   ``Why are they doing it now? Because they have committed crimes,killed people demonstrating for basic human rights. Now they aretrying to console people's anguish,'' said Jie Hu, a NorthwesternUniversity student.   ``They control everything, the economy, the daily lives of thepeople and what's in their minds,'' said Jie, who is from theSzechuan province in central China. ``It's absolute corruption.There is no way they can cure this without reforming the system.''   Wu'er was one of six dissident leaders who attended the openingceremony. All fled China and later surfaced in Paris, where theyhave been trying to rally worldwide support for the pro-democracymovement in their homeland.   Pro-democracy T-shirts were hung on the walls of the Universityof Illinois building. Some shirts said ``You are not alone'' andbore one of the lasting images from the protest: the photograph ofa man, standing alone, blocking a row of Chinese Army tanks.</TEXT></DOC>
