Senator Nunn, erstwhile heir to Senator Henry Jackson as a pro-defense Democrat, led the Senate Friday in passing a $303 billion defense bill that in effect contains his own narrow interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. President Reagan has enough votes to sustain a veto. But Senator Nunn vows to attach his treaty interpretation to every defense funding bill until the president has no choice but to sign or watch the military run out of money.    Why is a conservative Southerner suddenly bulldogging his Senate colleagues and the president to write into U.S. law what also happens to be the Soviet negotiating position on the ABM Treaty? Congress does have the power of the purse. But since when does that include the right to eviscerate the president's veto power or his power to implement treaties by holding every spending bill hostage to some senator's policy preference? Guerrilla politics is a strange way to formulate U.S. foreign policy.    By now we all should be used to congressional attempts to grab power from the executive, but this time the effort is especially egregious because it's so disingenuous. What's really going on here is a policy dispute over the future of America's Strategic Defense Initiative. Yet instead of facing the issue squarely, the Democratic leadership is trying to turn this into a battle over legal arcana and congressional power.    The legal arcana concern the Great Debate over how to interpret the 1972 ABM Treaty. The Reagan administration favors a broad interpretation that would allow testing (and perhaps deployment) of new and promising technologies for an anti-missile defense. Senator Nunn, backed by the congressional left, prefers a more restrictive reading that would ban even any testing -- and therefore cripple SDI by keeping it a research-only program.    Our own view is that while simply exercising the treaty's withdrawal provisions would be cleaner, a broad interpretation is a reasonable judgment based on the treaty text and the negotiating record. That, indeed, is how the Soviets read the treaty for years, until they saw that emerging technologies might allow the U.S. to build an effective defense. But however one reads the treaty, it seems absurd to cede a policy decision as important as America's nuclear defense to lawyers or treaty grammarians. If Senator Nunn and his colleagues don't want SDI tested or deployed, why don't they just vote against it?    One reason, we suspect, is that they understand that SDI is popular with voters. A second reason has to do with the almost theological belief among many in Congress that arms control itself is effective security policy. If the Soviets claim some U.S. position is a threat to arms control, then according to this view it must be a bad idea. Never mind that this ties the hands of U.S. negotiators by making concessions to the Soviets before they even sit down at the table.    We had never considered Senator Nunn part of this crowd, but his performance on the defense bill makes us wonder. We're not alone. South Carolina's Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings wrote in the Washington Post last week that, &quot;Shamefully, {Senator Nunn} threatens to use his muscle as Armed Services Committee chairman to gut future SDI funding if the president vetoes the Nunn-Levin Amendment. . . . In effect, he seeks to ratify a new treaty by a majority vote of the Senate instead of the constitutional two-thirds.&quot;    By carrying so much water for the anti-SDI, arms-control-at-any-cost wing of Congress, Senator Nunn may be helping his ambitions within the Democratic Party. But it's hard to see what interest Senator Nunn could have in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He's already presuming to run the foreign affairs of the United States from Suite 303 in the Dirksen Office Building. </TEXT></DOC>
