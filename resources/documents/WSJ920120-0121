Along with 20,000 purchase orders each year comes ahistory of intrigue. Long before the Dotan affair, Marine Lt.Col. Oliver North visited here in 1985 and first broachedwhat became the diversion of U.S. arms profits to CentralAmerica, according to Israeli officials.</LP><TEXT>   The lifeblood of the mission's operation is a $1.8 billionmilitary aid program that is unique in its size and thediscretion permitted by the U.S. Israel relies more than anyother aid recipient on commercial sales rather than the moreconventional government-to-government deals, which give thePentagon greater control. In the past four fiscal years, theNew York mission estimates it spent a total of $5.7 billionin U.S. military assistance, of which 60%, or $3.42 billion,went to commercial contracts.   Coordinating this spending through the mission givesIsrael greater purchasing power and avoids administrativecosts. But the result is to heighten the role of the New Yorkmission as both the bargaining unit and overseer of Israel'sprocurement program.   About 40 people oversee the operation, which relies on amuch larger, rotating staff of nearly 190 Israeli collegestudents to implement the multitude of purchase orders. Theturnover strengthens the hand of career military officers,whose seniority and grasp of technology make it easier forthem to control the civilian staff. Gen. Rami Dotan exploitedthese opportunities and was driven in part by his ambition tocircumvent New York and gain control over the Air Force'sengine budget.   Israel, the largest recipient of U.S. military andeconomic aid, enjoys unusually wide latitude in spending thefunds. For all other countries but Israel, the DefenseSecurity Assistance Agency (DSAA) insists on disbursing U.S.aid dollars directly to contractors, even in the case ofcommercial sales. But the Israeli mission is free to paysuppliers itself and later seek reimbursement from its aidaccount, while earning interest from the U.S. Treasury.   The result is to further distance DSAA from dealing withthe contractors receiving aid funds. Under the rules forIsraeli aid, the U.S. government isn't required to make aprior financial review of contracts of $500,000 or less,representing 89% of the orders typically placed by themission. In total dollars, they are far less -- about 16%.This adds up to $912 million over the past four years.   The system was ripe for the schemes of Gen. Dotan.Pentagon records indicate that he and his allies parceled outwork orders to stay under the $500,000 threshold. Recordsshow, for example, that a U.S. company in which Gen. Dotanheld a secret financial interest received $7.1 million brokeninto 47 purchase orders averaging $151,000.   Israel enjoys other special benefits in how it spendsmilitary aid. Unlike other countries, Israel is free to spendmuch of its aid within its own borders -- as much as $475million this year. Congress's General Accounting Office hascriticized the Pentagon for allowing Israel to spend thismoney freely -- for fuel, ammunition and other militarystaples, instead of entirely on &quot;advanced weapons systems,&quot;as the GAO says the law requires. The Pentagon's &quot;flexibleapproach,&quot; the GAO says, is &quot;tantamount to a cash transferprogram.&quot; The Defense Department rejects the GAO's assertion.   The Dotan Affair has brought renewed scrutiny to themission, where officials count themselves among the general'svictims. &quot;Dotan cheated everybody,&quot; says a high procurementofficial who likens the scandal to an &quot;earthquake.&quot; In thewake of the scandal, two lesser but still embarrassing casesof wrongdoing involving buyers have been flushed out. Andafter ignoring critics in the past, mission officials now saythere is an effort to tighten rules generally.   In a direct challenge to the military old-boy network,Moshe Kochanovsky, the director of the New York mission, hasordered buyers to report cases in which former defenseofficials are working for companies seeking business from themission. The directive should keep the buyers busy: Many U.S.firms are represented by former Israeli generals and defenseofficials.   Although commercial sales will continue, the new policyalso gives preference to government-to-governmenttransactions that can be better watched, even if thesetransactions come at a higher cost than commercial deals. &quot;Wewant to use this opportunity to rock the boat a little bit,&quot;says an Israeli official. &quot;It is a good opportunity.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;The Money Trail: U.S. Firms AreLinked To an Israeli General At Heart of a Scandal --- Fundsfor Defense Contracts Were Diverted, but Why?
