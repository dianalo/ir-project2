All U.S. charges were dropped.   Mr. Greco was born in Italy in 1939 to a family whosemembers own and operate a number of Italian hotels. Accordingto the printout, he was convicted of theft in 1962 by a Romecourt and sentenced to one year and four months in prison.That same year, according to a person who has known Mr. Grecofor 25 years, Mr. Greco moved to Lima, Peru, afterbefriending a Peruvian diplomat who had stayed in one of hisfamily's properties. In Lima, this person says, Mr. Grecoopened an Italian restaurant that was frequented by seniorgovernment officials.</LP><TEXT>   By 1968 he had moved to America. In the next four years,U.S. police records show, Mr. Greco was arrested at leastfive times for a variety of offenses: December 1968, NewOrleans, smuggling counterfeit Omega watches; July 1969,Miami, violating immigration laws; April 1970, Pompano Beach,Fla., illegally selling watches from a hotel room andattempting to bribe a police officer; December 1971, Miami,possessing false identification cards and an unlicensed .25caliber pistol; September 1972, Miami International Airport,possessing airline tickets stolen the previous summer from aLindhurst, N.J., travel agency. (Mr. Greco was rearrested tenyears later for the last offense when, after he narrowlyavoided an accident with a Miami police car, a routine checkof his driver's license revealed an outstanding arrestwarrant.) For various reasons, each of these charges wasdismissed.   According to several people familiar with his work, by themid-1970s Mr. Greco was operating as a paid informant inEurope for the federal Bureau of Narcotics, a predecessoragency to the Drug Enforcement Administration. His &quot;handler&quot;was Paul Knight, a federal agent who later became AmericanExpress's European security chief. In the late 1970s, thesepeople say, Mr. Greco helped American Express break a majorEuropean fraud case, and has done work off and on for thecompany ever since. He has also worked for a Washington-baseddetective agency. A former American Express executive sayscompany security officials believed the detective to begenerally above-board, although security officials &quot;knew hehad some trouble in one or two countries.&quot;   (See related story: &quot;The Safra Affair: A Saga of CorporateIntrigue --- The Vendetta: How American Express Orchestrateda Smear Of Rival Edmond Safra --- Top Aide to James RobinsonOversaw Two Who Spread False Stories World-Wide --- OfficersDeny Doing Wrong&quot; -- WSJ Sept. 24, 1990)</TEXT></DOC>
