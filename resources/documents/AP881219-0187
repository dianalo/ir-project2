Earlier, Japan for the first time indicated a willingness toupgrade economic ties with Moscow despite the impasse.   Rival claims over the tiny Kuril Islands off Japan's northernHokkaido Island has kept Moscow and Tokyo from signing a treaty toformally end World War II hostilities. This has stalledSoviet-Japanese relations and hampered economic cooperation betweenthe two countries.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, heading into asecond day of talks with Foreign Minister Sousuke Uno and otherofficials, met with Takeshita on Tuesday to deliver a letter fromSoviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   On Monday, Shevardnadze and Uno failed to iron out disagreementson the dispute during about 6{ hours of talks.   The ministry official, who briefed reporters on the condition ofanonymity, quoted Takeshita as telling Shevardnadze that resolutionof the land dispute ``would be the basis for permanent and stablerelations.'' The premier ``hoped the Soviet side would give seriousconsideration to the issue,'' he quoted Takeshita as saying.   The official said Shevardnadze, without proposing a specificdate, said Gorbachev has put a trip to Japan on his politicalschedule and that Takeshita was welcome to visit Moscow.   Soviet and Japanese officials labored on an agreement that mightboost economic ties despite the row over the Kurils, which Moscowhas held since the end of World War II and which Tokyo wants back.The Soviets ousted 17,000 Japanese residents and later consolidatedtheir occupation with 10,000 troops.   Shevardnadze asked Takeshita what Japan's attitude would be ifthe dispute is not solved, the Japanese official said, and Takeshitareplied that the problem should be tackled with eagerness.   ``The Soviets have shown no basic change in their position'' onwhat Japan calls the Northern Territories, the official said.   But he saw hope in the continued meetings of the two foreignministers and their aides on the issue.   Until now, Japanese officials said they expected no progress inbilateral relations until the Kremlin agreed to negotiate the returnof the islands.   But in his Monday meeting with Shevardnadze, Uno said: ``Japan isprepared to develop ... economic relations'' with the Soviet Union,a country he desribed as having ``great potential,'' the ForeignMinistry official reported.   Trade between the Soviet Union and Japan has been hindered bysensitivity over the territorial dispute and by national securityconcerns.   Two-way trade reached $4.9 billion in 1987 _ about 1.8 percent ofJapan's trade _ and is expected to hit $4.98 billion this year.   Gorbachev has ambitious plans to develop the vast Siberianregion, a feat that would require input from foreign investors,including the Japanese.   Before Shevardnadze's arrival, Japanese officials hinted at apossible compromise on the territorial dispute, but a senior ForeignMinistry official said Japan's demand for the islands' returnremains unchanged.</TEXT></DOC>
