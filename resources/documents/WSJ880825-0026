The Vietnam draft was breathing down the necks of a generation of men, Sen. Quayle's peers, who are now members of the young establishment in America, heads of corporations, members of Congress, men of some eminence. Mr. Lay says fraternity brothers of his went to Canada and never returned. Some of his friends went to Vietnam and never returned. In his own case, he had a student deferment as a Ph.D. candidate in economics, and later an occupational deferment as an official of Exxon Corp. &quot;As those deferments became tougher and tougher to come by, in mid-1967, I realized I was going to have to make some decisions.&quot; By the time his draft notice arrived in the mail, Mr. Lay had arranged to enter Navy Officer Candidate School.    &quot;I had the choice of going to the Greyhound bus station (as a draftee) or into the Navy (as an officer). Either one could have put me in Vietnam, but I would rather have gone as a naval officer.&quot;    As it turned out, Mr. Lay's academic and corporate record landed him in a high-level Pentagon assignment, where, as the war progressed, he served as an assistant to the assistant secretary of the Navy for financial affairs.    Wall Street Journal reporters this week have sought out such reminiscences from corporate officials, most of them chief executive officers of their companies, who were vulnerable to the draft during the peak years of the war -- 1965 to 1972. Specifically sought out were all 97 of the Vietnam draft-age men on a Forbes magazine list of the 800 most powerful chief executive officers in the U.S. The Journal has looked at the service record of members of Congress, as well, and spoken to prominent young attorneys and media executives.    Questions of interest are: How did these men deal with their military obligations, what did they do during the war? And how do they feel about how the Republican nominee for vice president dispatched his obligation in the Indiana National Guard?    Interviews produced profiles that appear in this story and a more general view of the Quayle generation, at least members of it who are part of the so-called power structure.    Of the 97 chief executives on the published list who were informally sought out by the Journal, only 54 responded. Of those, only two served in Vietnam, while a total of 27 served in the military, on active duty or in the reserves. Sixteen held deferments and never served. Eleven didn't serve, in some instances because they drew high numbers in the draft lottery instituted in 1969.    More than 175 members of Congress were eligible for the Vietnam era draft, but only about a quarter of them list military service in their official biographies. About one-fourth of those who mention serving list the National Guard.    The Journal identified 13 prominent members of the media and entertainment businesses who would have been eligible for military service in Vietnam. The list included chief executives, senior managers and print and broadcast journalists. Of the 13, six couldn't be reached for comment or chose not to respond. Four said they didn't serve because of medical reasons, and one didn't serve because he wasn't a U.S. citizen. One volunteered for the Air National Guard, and one served in the Navy for three years, part of that time in Vietnam.    Twenty years is a long time, but some things a guy doesn't forget. Like what he did during the war.    Even before U.S. troops were sent to Vietnam, middle-class kids with plans for their lives were figuring the angles and using the deferments available in the 1950s and '60s to beat the draft. The Selective Service System nurtured many young cynics.    In theory, one had to serve if called. In fact, there were many ways to get out of serving, and as many reasons to avoid a two-year hitch as there were young men with ambition. The patriotic adolescent ready to drop everything and go off to Fort Leonard Wood for eight weeks of painful basic training and two years of involuntary service was a rare bird.    By the time of Vietnam, when draftees actually were dying in a war, patriotic impulses did surge in many young people, but hardly the way they roused men to volunteer in World War II. Vietnam was a baffling war, unpopular, even reviled. And for many a draft-age man, the prevailing emotion was fear, mingled with dread and disgust. Whatever his politics, it was hard for an affluent college kid to conceive of leaving the protection of home and family, or alma mater, to go off and perhaps die for Lyndon Johnson.    The rules kept changing, and local draft boards had a great deal of discretion in whom they took. But at one time or other, a clever fellow could get a deferment (and maybe never have to serve at all) if he was in college or graduate school, if he was married, a father, an asthmatic or homosexual, or if he was seeing a shrink. The possibilities were so numerous that shooting off a toe or fleeing to Canada -- in fear or principle -- usually wasn't necessary just to stay out of Vietnam. And if one were going to bite the bullet and serve, there were easier ways to do it than to submit to the draft and trust to the fates.    Dan Quayle, George Bush's 41-year-old running mate, was hardly the only man his age in 1969 to see opportunity in state National Guard units or in the reserves of the military branches. Volunteering for the Guard, when there was no waiting list to worry about, meant six months of active duty, not two years, and a very remote possibility of seeing combat. Joining the Guard meant for Mr. Quayle, who was a supporter of the war, the opportunity to go to law school, not combat. Not such a smart career move, it turns out, for a man who could be vice president of the United States in 1988, but who knew? &quot;I did not know in 1969 that I would be in this room today, I'll confess,&quot; Sen. Quayle said last week in an unguarded moment.    The Journal's survey of business and community leaders now in their 30s and 40s suggests that Mr. Quayle had plenty of company. But having witnessed his current public ordeal, many CEOs aren't particularly eager to talk to newspaper reporters this week about their own military records. (As an annoyed spokesman for one CEO put the privacy issue: &quot;He's not running for vice president.&quot;) But men who speak freely have some interesting tales to tell.    Arthur Laffer, the former chief economist of the Office of Management and Budget was a graduate student in 1963, 22 years old and married; his first child was born in 1964. &quot;I was out through no advice or help from anyone,&quot; he jokes, with reference to Sen. Quayle. &quot;It was nature.&quot;    Mr. Laffer says he isn't surprised that Sen. Quayle's military background should now be scrutinized. In the late 1950s and early '60s, Mr. Laffer says, he and his friends were keenly aware of how their military and political affiliations might come under examination later in their careers.    &quot;We thought it would all come back to haunt us,&quot; he says. &quot;You didn't sign your name to anything, join controversial organizations. We were extra careful. They were real tense times.&quot; Still, Mr. Laffer says, he hated the draft. &quot;I really believe in having government out of body, soul and pocketbook.&quot;    The draft, which had been maintained at varying levels since 1948, entered a maelstrom during the Vietnam War, which for the U.S. began with the Tonkin Gulf Resolution in August 1964: It was protested, amended and finally discarded in July 1973, as the U.S. was getting out of Vietnam. It had reached its peak in 1966, when 382,010 young men were conscripted.    From 1964 through 1969, the Defense Department set quotas for each state, and they were parceled out among 4,000 local boards, which took men between the ages of 18 and 26, oldest first. Deferments for college and graduate students resulted in disproportionate burdens on less-advantaged youths, on the poor and the black. In February 1968, graduate-school deferments were ended except for medical specialties. Men already in graduate school, however, were allowed to stay.    In November 1969, a national lottery system was adopted. The first drawing, based on birth dates, was held in December 1969, and covered eligible men born between 1944 and 1950. Men were drafted through the first 195 birth dates drawn in 1969. The following year, the lottery covered eligible men born in 1951, establishing age 20 as the prime age for induction.    Steven Brill, 38, the president of AmLaw Newspapers Corp., says he was No. 335 in the lottery. When the number 30 was announced for Aug. 22, his birthday, Mr. Brill recalls, &quot;I was on my way to Canada.&quot; But about 20 minutes later, the announcer corrected the error and put Mr. Brill out of his misery. &quot;I don't know what I would have done&quot; if called, Mr. Brill says. &quot;I would not have fought in the war in Vietnam. It was an immoral, illegal war.&quot;    Through all the years of the draft, men had the option of enlisting in the service of their choice, including the National Guard and the reserves, rather than be conscripted. The National Guard was called up for Vietnam in 1968, after the Tet offensive created a demand for additional troops. But that turned out to be the only time Guard units were sent to Vietnam. From 1964 through 1972, about 5,000 Army reservists went to Vietnam, 7,050 National Guardsmen.    Neil T. Anderson, a 42-year-old partner at Sullivan andamp; Cromwell in New York, spent six years in the Army Reserves, which he joined while in law school. Mr. Anderson says that joining the Reserves allowed him to finish his education, and that he got into the Reserves the &quot;regular&quot; way, by putting his name on a waiting list and waiting for his name to come up.    He says it doesn't distress him that Mr. Quayle joined the National Guard. &quot;There were three options for that generation in order to fulfill their obligation: waiting to be drafted, enlisting, or joining the reserves or the Guard. All were honorable solutions.&quot; He believes that if it turns out Mr. Quayle used influence to get in, that might change his feelings, but, as he understands the facts, &quot;someone making a phone call is not the same thing as paying a bribe.&quot;    Here's how some other prominent American men recall what they did when duty called.    Todd Herrick   At 45, he is the president and chief executive officer of Tecumseh Products Co. in Tecumseh, Mich. He says he enlisted in the Army in 1969, and served until 1972, with about a year of that as an Army helicopter pilot in Vietnam. He was past draft age at the time but felt &quot;there was an obligation&quot; to serve.    &quot;If you went to Canada or Sweden, I guess I frown on that,&quot; he says. &quot;If you stayed here and protested and went to jail, OK. If you went into the Guard, fine.&quot; The whole debate, he says, &quot;ought to be something that's put behind us. I think it's ridiculous to worry about whether he (Dan Quayle) went into the Guard or went to Nam.&quot;    Oliver Stone   The 41-year-old Academy Award-winning director and writer (&quot;Platoon,&quot; &quot;Wall Street&quot;) dropped out of Yale after a year there. He taught school near Saigon in 1965 and later served on a merchant ship. He returned to Vietnam in 1967 in the 25th Infantry Division, served in the First Cavalry Division and was wounded twice. He was awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart for his service. Mr. Stone has strong views about the war, and about Dan Quayle.    &quot;The controversy over Quayle goes to the whole class issue of the war, which Lyndon Baines Johnson chose to fight with the underclass of this country,&quot; Mr. Stone says. &quot;It seems to me that when you fight a war you send everybody. . . . Otherwise, it's undercutting the basis of democracy.    &quot;Dan Quayle is everything I can't stand in my generation. Guys like him are willing to fight to the last drops of someone else's blood.    &quot;My question is, how can a political leader share a vision of a country without having suffered in any meaningful sense for that country? Civil disobedience is also a justifiable doctrine, but Quayle didn't practice either one. He didn't fight or protest. He took the easy way out.&quot;    Paul F. Eckstein   The 47-year-old partner at Brown andamp; Bain in Phoenix joined the Army Reserves after completing law school in 1966. He says that when he joined, getting into the Reserves was a simple matter of signing up, although he says that changed. He spent six years in the Reserves and left as a captain. At the time he joined, he was married and 25 years old, so he thinks there is a good chance he would not have been drafted.    Back during the Vietnam War, says Mr. Eckstein, &quot;There were these posters that said, 'You'll sleep better knowing that (fill in the blank) is in the National Guard.' I would sleep better knowing Dan Quayle was in the National Guard than on the national ticket. If you go to any golf course in the United States on a Saturday, half the people playing would be better qualified to be vice president.&quot;    Mickey Arison   The 39-year-old president of Carnival Cruise Lines marched in war protests at college in Miami and still views the war as a waste: &quot;50,000 people lost their lives -- why?&quot;    Mr. Arison had a high draft number and was never called. &quot;I'm not really sure what I would have done&quot; had the number come up, he reflects. &quot;At the time I was very liberal, very much against the war. But I didn't have to address the issue of whether to go if called.&quot;    Mr. Arison said his politics have drifted rightward as he's grown older. And the Quayle flap &quot;doesn't bother me at all. What bothers me is the big deal the press is making out of it,&quot; he says. &quot;I think it's exaggerated. I think there were a lot of reporters with no news to report so they jumped on this. It seems to me a nonissue.&quot;    Edward P. Mahoney   The 40-year-old chief operating officer of American Savings andamp; Loan Association of Florida says he joined the Army after graduating from college, but his military service was cut short.    &quot;I enlisted for three years because I was told I'd have a better chance of getting the type of assignment you'd want. After six months, I was to go to officer training school, but they discovered I'd had bronchial asthma, and the next week I was discharged.    &quot;I was very disappointed. I fully expected to go to Vietnam. My hobby is sky diving. My father was in the Marine Corps. I pictured myself going into the Special Forces.&quot;    Robert L. Hamilton   The 46-year-old city attorney for Orlando went into Vietnam the same year Sen. Quayle was heading into the Guard. It was 1969, and things weren't pleasant at Camp Eagle along the DMZ where Mr. Hamilton was stationed with an army unit. He was exposed to the herbicide Agent Orange, he says. He took shrapnel and won a Purple Heart, &quot;not a difficult thing to do up there in those days.&quot;    Since Mr. Hamilton returned in 1970 -- after 366 days, 12 hours and 22 minutes in Vietnam -- he has undergone surgery 15 times, mostly for simple skin cancers, but also melanoma, a particularly dangerous malignancy. The cancer is in his lymph system now. He believes that it was Agent Orange that made him sick.    He had been drafted three weeks after passing the Florida Bar exam and decided to enlist rather than wait for induction because he had heard that enlisted men were treated better than draftees. He is troubled by the Quayle flap.    &quot;I'm sitting here full of scars from skin cancer and loaded up with Agent Orange, and if I'd have had my druthers I wouldn't have gone, either,&quot; he says.    &quot;It appears to me strings were pulled and favoritism was shown. That truly distresses me. This is the land of opportunity. We're all supposed to get an equal shot. Well, some are more equal than others. I think he got preferential treatment, and that's what bothers people.&quot;    Peter R. Kann   Mr. Kann, 45, is an executive vice president of Dow Jones andamp; Co. and associate publisher of The Wall Street Journal:   In 1964 as he was graduating from Harvard, Mr. Kann tried to volunteer for the Army reserves but was rejected for medical reasons. Mr. Kann says he applied &quot;on the theory I probably would be drafted otherwise.&quot; But his intent, he adds, was to shorten his service rather than to avoid Vietnam. Getting drafted meant a two-year stint, while joining the reserves wasn't a full-time commitment.    Norman Pearlstine   Mr. Pearlstine, 45, the managing editor of this newspaper, graduated from Haverford College in 1964, and had a student deferment from the draft to attend the University of Pennsylvania law school through 1967. While in law school, he applied to Navy Officer Candidate School and was turned down for medical reasons.    Craig Whitney   Until recently the Washington bureau chief of the New York Times and now head of the newspaper's London bureau, he graduated from Harvard in 1965. Mr. Whitney, 44, applied to Navy Officer Candidate School after college and was commissioned as an ensign. He served in the Navy from 1966 to 1969.    Mr. Whitney volunteered for a year's tour of duty in Vietnam, where he was a public information officer for the Seventh Fleet. &quot;I wanted to see what was happening,&quot; he says, &quot;and I wasn't going to be in the trenches.&quot;    Mr. Whitney says he went to OCS because he felt it would lessen his chances of combat duty. &quot;I had more choices as to what I would do. That is why I did it.&quot;    Patrick M. McLaughlin   The 42-year-old U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Ohio, had a student deferment but says he decided in 1966 to volunteer for the Army. His family had always served the country in times of war, he says.    He spent a year and one day in active combat, including a stint as a point man -- the first man in line walking through the jungle. He came back with several medals, including the Purple Heart.    Though he is proud of his own service in Vietnam, he says he is reluctant to pass judgment on Sen. Quayle. When Mr. McLaughlin volunteered, he says, the war was still a legitimate conflict. When he returned, people spat at him. Priests, politicians, civic leaders and Hollywood entertainers were railing against the war. He thinks young men in 1969 were deeply confused.    &quot;No kid could think straight,&quot; he says. &quot;It was difficult for the nation, let alone an 18- or 19-year-old to understand.&quot;    Larry Pressler   The South Dakota Republican senator served in Vietnam as a lieutenant in the U.S. Army. He says he isn't troubled by Sen. Quayle's choice to serve in the National Guard because he believes the Indiana senator didn't get there unfairly. Sen. Pressler enlisted when it was clear his number was going to be called in the draft lottery.    &quot;If it became known to me that somebody got in ahead of somebody else through some unfair practice, I would not support him for vice president,&quot; he says. &quot;But that has not been demonstrated. Sen. Quayle took one of many options floating around.&quot;    The South Dakota lawmaker says, &quot;It's true that the Guard was full of white upper-class people, and whenever somebody went into a unit it meant some poor black guy had to go to Vietnam.&quot; He says, too, that if someone entered the guard &quot;illegally or by cutting corners and then wants to be vice president, I think it's fair to ask questions about it.&quot;    David Eisenhower   The 40 year old author-historian is the grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower. He served as a Navy officer for three years after graduating from Amherst College. He decided not to make the Navy a career because &quot;forces were semi-demoralized&quot; after Vietnam.    He says he applied in the fall of 1969 for the Navy Officer Candidate School program in Newport, R.I. and was accepted in the spring of 1970. He graduated from OCS in the spring of 1971 as an ensign.    &quot;My dad suggested it,&quot; Mr. Eisenhower recalls of his decision to volunteer for the Navy. &quot;His point was, 'Don't feel that you have to set an example in Vietnam (by going there in the Army.'&quot;    &quot;For me, the problem was that I was the son-in-law of the president (Nixon),&quot; Mr. Eisenhower recalls. &quot;The concept of service for me was an awkward one.&quot;    Mr. Eisenhower says his lottery number came up 30; it was virtually certain he would be drafted were he not already enrolled in the Navy program. So he gave no thought to dropping out, as some people with safe lottery numbers did.    He thinks the Quayle episode was almost &quot;calculated to reopen old wounds&quot; in American society. &quot;Sooner or later, this issue was going to be ventilated,&quot; he says. &quot;I don't know if Bush foresaw it or not, but surely some of his people must have.&quot;    Answers to the moral aspects of the questions about what Quayle did &quot;are in the eye of the beholder,&quot; Mr. Eisenhower said. &quot;Only he (Sen. Quayle) knows if he was performing his duty honorably. . . . I will say that I think the people who deserve credit are the ones who went to Vietnam, who took the chance and had the guts to go to Vietnam.&quot;    Ronald Castille   Philadelphia's 44-year-old district attorney volunteered for the Marine Corps in 1966, and served in Vietnam as second lieutenant and platoon commander. He lost his right leg as a result of wounds suffered in a machine-gun attack. He was awarded the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts.    Mr. Castille, a Republican, believes the Quayle contoversy has hurt the Bush campaign for the presidency: &quot;We are talking about two radically different visions of government between Bush and Dukakis, and that message isn't coming through.&quot;    Mr. Castille defends National Guard service as &quot;patriotic.&quot; He notes that Sen. Quayle &quot;didn't go to divinity school or education school to try to evade the draft.&quot; But Mr. Castille adds, the senator &quot;himself has fueled a lot of (the controversy) by not coming up with the answers or (by) seeming to evade the answers.&quot;    Mr. Castille predicts that similar doubts about Vietnam-era military service will be raised about other politicians of his generation. By the late 1960s, he recalls, many young men believed that &quot;our policies (in Vietnam) were hopeless, and our efforts were essentially meaningless.&quot; The Guard and the reserves were seen as &quot;the thing to do, a place to go&quot; to minimize chances of being sent to the war, he says. &quot;You're going to have to look at a lot of people and see what they did. It's going to come up a lot.&quot;    B.T. Collins   A vice president of asset finance for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. in Sacramento finds the Quayle controversy hypocritical. &quot;It's ironic. The worm has turned,&quot; he says. Twenty years ago, says Mr. Collins, when he returned to college after losing an arm and a leg as a Green Beret in Vietnam, &quot;I was a bum and a 'baby-killer.' Now, you've got to be a Vietnam vet to be the vice president.&quot;    The 47-year-old Mr. Collins, who served as chief of staff for Edmund G. Brown Jr. when he was governor of California, enlisted in the Army in 1963 after dropping out of college. The draft, while it existed in 1963, &quot;wasn't really a factor&quot; in those years, he notes. Mr. Collins, who spent two tours in Vietnam, says he has no problems with Mr. Quayle's decision to join the National Guard: &quot;He didn't go to Canada. He stepped up to the plate. He just did it a different way.&quot; Collins also said he respects conscientious objectors.    He has nothing but scorn, however, for those people who are parading their Vietnam service but who didn't actually see combat. &quot;What you've got is a lot of phony Vietnam vets . . . and nobody's got the guts to ask, 'What did you do there?' What's the difference whether you spent your summers at summer camp or in an air-conditioned trailer in Saigon, drinking cold beer and sleeping on clean sheets?&quot; he asks.    William B. Ellis   The 48-year-old chief executive of Northeast Utilities, in Hartford, Conn., enlisted in the Army and served in the U.S. between 1967 and 1969 as computer specialist, reaching the rank of captain.    &quot;So that the large roulette wheel in the sky -- with a little assistance from myself -- wasn't likely to select me (for Vietnam). I made very sure that my description of capabilities and skills showed I could make a more effective use of my time, and be of better service somewhere else.&quot; And &quot;I made special efforts to see to it that my time in service took maximum advantage of my capability. I just had to raise my hand when they asked, 'Does anyone here know anything about computers?'&quot;    &quot;I'd be interested in hearing the name of anyone in your survey who was rushing to go.&quot; Among 220 officers in his group at Fort Benning, Ga., he says, &quot;almost everyone had orders for Vietnam.&quot; The atmosphere at Fort Benning was &quot;morose.&quot; Sen. Quayle &quot;would have been extraordinary to choose to deliberately go&quot; to Vietnam. &quot;To the extent he felt he would better serve the world as an attorney . . . I can't fault him.&quot;    Alan Dershowitz   The 49-year-old left-leaning Harvard law professor had a student deferment. &quot;If drafted, I would have served. Actually, I was rooting for the U.S. to win the Vietnam War. I am a patriot. At the same time, though, I legally defended objectors and draft dodgers, because I felt they had a legal right not to fight in a war if they did not choose to.&quot;    As to Sen. Quayle: &quot;I think America needs to discuss the Quayle affair. It would be hypocritical not to. We should be appalled at the hypocrisy of somebody who is a hawk and at the same time used his influence to evade combat. He was willing to have other people die in a war which he himself was not willing to fight.&quot;    ---         What Corporate Chiefs Did During Vietnam         (Breakdown of 54 CEOs providing information)    No military service       27%    Active duty elsewhere     14%    Reserves                  11%    Vietnam                    2%   NOTE: Results based on a survey of CEOs of 800 major companies who were between the ages of 18 and 25 during the peak Vietnam years of 1965-72.
