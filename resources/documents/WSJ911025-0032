But if he does decide to join the campaign, hewill enhance the Democrats' chances in the 1992 election.   The New York governor could turn out to be the formidablefigure that many experts of both parties anticipate -- anarticulate spokesman for Democratic values and anestablished, experienced politician who has the toughness andcapacity to rattle President Bush.</LP><TEXT>   Or he could peak the day he enters the race, and prove tobe an insulated, vastly overrated national figure.   But even if the 59-year-old Mr. Cuomo -- introspective,combative, sometimes even given to brooding -- flops as apresidential candidate, the Democratic prospects might stillbe bolstered: The candidate who prevails in a field thatincludes Mr. Cuomo will have slain a political giant.   &quot;By entering the race,&quot; says Thomas Kiley, a Boston-basedDemocratic pollster, &quot;he dramatically enhances the value ofthe nomination.&quot;   So, suddenly, almost inevitably, the 40-room governor'sresidence here, with its elements of Victorian and Romanesquestyles, is emerging as the center of the Democrats' politicalworld.   &quot;The minute he steps into the race, it's a differentrace,&quot; says Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic political pollster.&quot;We've got a race now where each of the candidates has achance to define himself and set the scene as he wishes. WithCuomo in, you have a person who defines the race himself --and inevitably becomes the point of reference around whicheveryone else is defined.&quot;   Mr. Cuomo, who prides himself on being articulate, ishimself providing no clues as to his intentions. For months,he disdainfully brushed aside inquiries about the presidency,saying he had neither plans nor plans to make plans to seekthe White House. Now he's openly conceding that he's thinkingabout running.   More than any other U.S. politician, Mr. Cuomo thinks outloud. But even now, only 15 weeks before the Iowa caucuses,that thinking hasn't progressed very far. One leadingDemocratic strategist he has consulted said he didn't thinkthat Mr. Cuomo had broached the subject even with his wifemore than passingly; the governor said yesterday he hadexchanged only &quot;two or three words&quot; on a presidentialcampaign with his son and close adviser, Andrew. The governorhasn't asked political advisers to map out a strategy forhim, or even to walk him through the hurdles. He has askedonly for a list of the primaries and caucuses.   That doesn't keep fellow Democrats from lining up behindhim. Reps. Charles Schumer and Thomas Downey, fellow NewYorkers, and David Obey of Wisconsin have gone onto the Housefloor to urge him to run.   &quot;If you have the opportunity to run for another office,should you do it? Is it better for the people?&quot; Mr. Cuomomused yesterday. &quot;The question is not complicated. Getting tothe answer is.&quot;   His closest allies, moreover, concede they have no ideawhat is going on in the governor's mind and are split overwhether he will join the campaign. Mr. Cuomo, in short, isheading an exploratory committee of one, and most of theterrain he's exploring is internal.   &quot;This stuff is like Elvis sightings,&quot; says WilliamCunningham, a political consultant and former political aideto Mr. Cuomo. &quot;People will write anything about what Cuomo isgoing to do. The best we can do is to believe him.&quot;   These questions are taking on such urgency because of Mr.Cuomo's unusual position in U.S. politics, an eloquenthigh-profile governor of a big state. Even though some Bushadvisers, describing him as a liberal from a state with hightaxes, say publicly they'd like to run against Mr. Cuomo,they have private concerns about a Cuomo candidacy. Theyworry that he is the only Democratic figure large enough tostand as an equal to the president, and they worry that thegovernor's ability to paint Mr. Bush as a protector of therich will corrode the president's support.   Not everybody, however, believes that Mr. Cuomo wouldblithely glide to the nomination. A Washington Post columnthis week by the influential David Broder argued that Mr.Cuomo's appeal may be a &quot;mirage.&quot;   For a brilliant leader in one of America's mostcosmopolitan political cultures, Mr. Cuomo is remarkablyprovincial. He is unfamiliar with the important earlypolitical states of Iowa and New Hampshire, and repeatedlyplays down the importance of regional differences -- apotentially serious liability when the campaign heads intothe Southern states in early March.   Moreover, his aggressive intellectual bearing, soattractive at first blush, may swiftly lose its appeal.   &quot;The minute he gets out on the field he immediately blowsthe other candidates out,&quot; says Eddie Mahe, a GOP politicalconsultant. &quot;They are just scrunched. He will immediatelyjump to the top of the polls. He has the star quality. Hecloses down everybody else's finance committee. He absolutelyowns the press. But then he'll open his mouth and startgetting in trouble.&quot;   Mr. Cuomo also faces the problems of joining a race thatwaited for him to begin and then began without him.   &quot;He's a player, yes, but would the race be over?Absolutely not,&quot; says Tim Raftis, campaign manager for Sen.Tom Harkin of Iowa. &quot;If anything, he's got a lot of catchingup to do.&quot;   Moreover, his record as governor of a state that,according to the Census Bureau, has the second-heaviest rateof state and local taxation, would also come under scrutiny-- and criticism. Cynthia Green, senior research associate ofthe Citizen's Budget Committee, says New York has rundeficits in seven of the nine years Mr. Cuomo has beengovernor. She argues that the state's short-term borrowingneeds are dangerously high.   Indeed, the key to the Cuomo decision, or at least thepretext that the three-term governor will offer to explainhis decision, is the fiscal condition of New York state.   Just months after the most bruising budget battle in NewYork history, the state is already running a $155 millionbudget deficit through the first half of the fiscal year,with Mr. Cuomo now acknowledging that the gap couldeventually be around $800 million. If he decides not to run,he inevitably will argue that the state is in too muchtrouble to abandon it now. If he decides to run, he almostcertainly will say that the only way to fix the mess here inAlbany -- and in state capitals throughout the troubledNortheast and beyond -- is to fix the mess in Washington.   &quot;There is an obvious umbilical relationship between thestate and federal governments,&quot; Mr. Cuomo told reporters at anews conference yesterday, keeping the question alive. &quot;Thereis nothing that happens in the state that isn't affected byWashington.&quot;   The deteriorating fiscal situation and the possibilitythat the state Legislature might be summoned back to Albanyto address it weighs heavily on Mr. Cuomo, potentiallyaffecting his plans. &quot;If you have difficulties with thebudget, it's an argument for dealing with the budget,&quot; hesaid yesterday.   Even so, Mr. Cuomo has characterized New York as &quot;exactlythe place from which to run&quot; for a candidate who wants tostress domestic economic questions. He delights in pointingout that the most poignant pictures of the Great Depressionare set in New York, adding in an interview this summer, &quot;Howcome it didn't kill Roosevelt?&quot;   He has talked about the difficulties, political andpractical, of running for president while addressing thestate's programs; he remembers that a week before MichaelDukakis announced his presidential candidacy, thethen-governor of Massachusetts traveled quietly to Albany toseek Mr. Cuomo's views on how to handle budget problems and anational political campaign at the same time. Now Mr. Cuomois toying with the question out loud, suggesting in aninterview for public television in New York that &quot;it would bevery, very difficult to remain as governor.&quot;   But some, including former Dukakis aide and strategistJohn Sasso, believe there may be some advantages andopportunities to retaining the governorship.   &quot;It's not impossible to do both successfully in the earlystages of the presidential race, particularly one that is ascompressed as this one,&quot; Mr. Sasso says. &quot;The later you go,though, it becomes increasingly difficult.&quot;   Meanwhile, those close to Mr. Cuomo are attempting to dampthe notion that the governor -- who likes to return to Albanyalmost every night, even from California -- is reluctant toput himself through the rigors of a presidential race. Theycite his dogged efforts in 1982, when he first defeated NewYork Mayor Edward Koch for the gubernatorial nomination andthen went on to defeat drugstore magnate Lew Lehrman in aclose general-election race.   &quot;He knows you can't just go on the radio from Albany orQueens and run your campaign that way,&quot; says John Marino, theDemocratic state chairman here. &quot;We're not dealing withsomeone who doesn't know how this works.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
