No love is lost between this town in north central Salvador andthe government of President Jose Napoleon Duarte. His administrationand its army consider this, like others revived by people returningfrom refugee camps in Honduras, as hostile territory.   In an interview, a local rebel commander known only as``Antolin'' said under no circumstances would voters be targets inthe guerrilla campaign to discredit the elections.   But no election was scheduled in Santa Marta, where sympathiesclearly lie with the leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberationfront, which has waged a 9-year-old war against the U.S.-backedgovernment.   The rebels have called for an election boycott to prove that apolitical solution is impossible without their participation.   Every day from 6 a.m. to 8 a.m., radios in Santa Marta are tunedto the rebels' Radio Farabundo Marti and Radio Venceremos.   Women grind corn or pat tortillas as men drink coffee beforeheading to the fields. On one morning this week, all listened to aradio account of overnight attacks on ``the puppet army'' andadmonishments that every Salvadoran do his part to prepare forinsurrection.   Guerrillas are greeted with smiles and offered cool melon juice.   Government soldiers, on their rare appearances, are shunned.   ``The soldiers three times set fire to the cornfields aroundhere,'' said Lainez. ``The last time they came through, a few wentup to people and told them, `Just wait until Arena is in power.We'll be back with a bomb for every house.'''   Alfredo Cristiani of the rightist Republican NationalistAlliance, or Arena, is expected to win Sunday's election. In itscampaign, Arena has taken a hard line on the war, threatening amilitary solution.   In an attempt to disrupt voting on Sunday, rebels announced atransportation strike that government officials said paralyzed morethan 90 percent of the nation's transport services. Rebels alsosabotaged utilities leaving much of the nation without power orwater for the past five days.   The government has said soldiers will be stationed at polls toguarantee voter safety.   ``We will attack military objectives in the countryside, in thecities and on the roads. But the people will never become a militarytarget,'' Antolin said from his mountain stronghold.   ``If civilians are killed or wounded, they will be victims ofrightist terrorists trying to make us look bad,'' he said.   But Santa Marta and at least 23 other rebel-controlled townsresidents were to follow the rebel lead and boycott polls Sunday.Col. Jose Herrarte, provincial military commander, said support forthe guerrillas was firmly entrenched in Santa Marta.   ``The subversives count on them for supplies, recruitment andrest,'' he said. ``They portray us only as murderers, violators ofhuman rights, ogres.''   An estimated 20,000 Salvadorans were driven from their homes bythe war, aerial bombardments and repression in the early 1980s.Since October 1987, about 6,500 have returned.   ``When we came back, this was just woods and brush,'' saidLainez. ``Every house had been burned, and the fields wereovergrown.''   Now many people are enlarging their homes and working cooperativefarms.   ``Because of the war, there are lots of widows and orphanshere,'' said Lainez. ``If we weren't a cooperative, those peoplewould die.''</TEXT></DOC>
