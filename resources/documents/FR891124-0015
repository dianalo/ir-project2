On November24, 1987, the Department of Justice published an interim final rule toimplement sections 274A and 274B of the INA. 52 FR 44972 (November 24,1987). The interim final rule designated hearing procedures to guide inthe conduct of section 274A and 274B proceedings. The interim final ruleestablished a set of rules for all cases properly brought before the AdministrativeLaw Judges which comply with the requirements of the INA.The interim final rule provided for responsive pleadings with complaintslodged with the Office of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer. Timelimits were established for the various pleadings. Discretionary pre-hearingstatements and conferences designed to streamline the proceedings werealso provided.A discovery process was set forth to assist the Administrative Law Judgeand the parties in the development of the facts and a complete record.Consistent with the INA, the rules provided the Administrative Law Judgewith subpoena power and included a provision that a subpoena may be enforcedin the appropriate federal district court.Representation by any licensed attorney in good standing was allowed inall cases. Individuals may also appear pro se. In unfair immigration-relatedemployment cases, any person who believed that he/she had been adverselyaffected directly by an unfair immigration-related employment practice,or any individual or private organization authorized in writing to acton such person's behalf could petition the Administrative Law Judge tointervene or appear under certain circumstances. Intervenors as partiesand amicus curiae were also permitted under certain circumstances.The actual mechanics of the hearing were set forth. After the close ofthe hearing, the Administrative Law Judge was given the full authorityto make appropriate awards, grant relief, and issue other appropriate ordersas provided by statute.In cases involving knowingly hiring, recruiting or referring for a fee,for employment in the United States, of aliens not authorized to work inthe United States, and failure to comply with employment verification requirementsand prohibition of indemnity bond cases, the Administrative Law Judge'sdecision was subject to review by the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer.This official had the authority to vacate or modify the decision, but hadno review authority over other immigration-related matters. Thereafter,judicial review was available. Failure to request that the Chief AdministrativeHearing Officer review a decision by the Administrative Law Judge did notprevent a party from seeking judicial review. In cases involving unfairimmigration-related employment practices, only judicial review was available.Recourse to the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer was not available.Although not required under the Administrative Procedures Act for the promulgationof rules of agency procedure or practice, the Executive Office of ImmigrationReview published the interim final rule with a request for comments. 52FR 44973 (November 24, 1987). The comment period ended on December 24,1987. A total of three comments were received and considered in preparingthis final rule. Changes were made in this final rule based on considerationof the comments received and experience gained by the agency in implementingthe hearing procedures. What follows is a section-by-section analysis ofthe final revisions to the interim final rule and a discussion of commentsconcerning the sections to which they apply.Section 68.1 briefly sets out the scope of the rules of practice and isrevised to state that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be usedas general guidelines in any situation not otherwise provided for by theserules, or by any statute, executive order, or regulation. The interim finalrule stated that the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure shall be used insuch situations. This provision was changed to give the AdministrativeLaw Judge flexibility in applying the appropriate procedure in a hearingor proceeding. While the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are the generalguidelines to be followed, this section recognizes that there may be situationsin which it would be more appropriate for another standard to be applied.In particular, such standards would apply if it would be less expensivefor the parties expedite the matter, and meet the ends of justice withoutprejudicing any party.Section 68.2 subsection (d) was revised to include an Acting Chief AdministrativeHearing Officer in the definition of the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer.Language repeating the administrative review authority of such officialsunder andSection; 63.51 was removed from subsection (d) as surplusage.Section 68.2 subsection (m) was revised to remove requests for discoveryfrom the definition of a pleading. Consistent with this revision, andSection;andSection;68.17 through 68.19 of the final rule are also revised. The purpose ofthese revisions is to remove the administrative burden which resulted fromthe interim requirement of filing discovery requests and responses withthe court. Finally, this section was revised to allow a party to submita pleading to the Chief Administrative Hearing Officer before a case isassigned to an Administrative Law Judge.Section 68.3 was revised and reorganized. Under the final rules this provisionapplies only to service of documents by the Chief Administrative HearingOfficer or the Administrative Law Judge assigned to the case. Section 68.4was revised and now deals with notice of date, time, and place of hearing.Section 68.5 covers service and filing of documents by parties. Such procedureswere previously included in interim final rule andSection; 68.3. The revisionschange the sequence of the rules and they will be renumbered accordingly.Section 68.6 governs the form of pleadings and documents. The revisionsrequire complaints to contain a more complete statement of facts and law.Complainants are also required to attach certain administrative recordsto the complaint to allow the Office of the Chief Administrative HearingOfficer to confirm proper jurisdiction. The final rule aids respondentsin preparing answers to complaints by reducing the need for filing a motionfor a more definite statement.Section 68.7 provides rules for time computations and allows a party, servedby mail, an additional five days beyond the prescribed period to file aresponse. This section was revised and no longer adds five days to theprescribed filing period when a party files a pleading by mail. This revisionis consistent with the Administrative Procedure Act and the Federal Rulesof Civil Procedure.Regarding andSection; 68.8(c), concern was expressed by a commenter thatrequiring a respondent to answer each allegation of the complaint was duplicativeand burdensome because 8 CFR 274a.9(d) requires a respondent to answereach allegation in the Notice to Fine. Section 274a.9(d) of 8 CFR has beenrevised and an answer to the allegations in the Notice to Fine is not mandatory.Since this is a more formal proceeding a detailed answer is necessary.Consequently, andSection; 68.8(c) is not revised.Section 68.9 deals with motions and requests and is revised to clarifythe Chief Administrative Hearing Officer's authority to act on non-adjudicatorymatters prior to the appointment of an Administrative Law Judge. The titleof subsection (b) ``[a]nswers to motions,'' was changed to ``[r]esponsesto motions.'' The term responses is more accurate than the term answers,which could be confused with answers to complaints.Section 68.12 deals with the form and submission of consent findings ordismissals. This section was previously entitled Consent order or settlement.The title of this section was changed to clarify that the section dealswith consent findings and dismissals. In addition, this section was reorganizedfor further clarification. Subsection: (a) Dealing with deferments of proceedingswas deleted as surplusage in view of the general powers of the AdministrativeLaw Judge under andSection; 68.26(a) and the Administrative Procedure Act.A change was made to correct a technical deficiency by referring to anorder submitted by the parties as a proposed order. A further change wasmade in subsection (c) to provide for ``decision and order'' rather thanjust ``order.'' This change was made for administrative efficiency so thatthe Administrative Law Judge does not have to rewrite the submission. Finally,this section was revised to provide that dismissal of an action by consentof the parties is subject to the Administrative Law Judge's approval.Section 68.13 was revised by removing the regulatory provision grantingthe Special Counsel the right to intervene at any time in section 274Bproceedings. Section 68.13 now provides that Special Counsel, like interestedprivate persons or organizations, may intervene at the Administrative LawJudge's discretion. This revision was made because the statute does notexpressly provide for intervention as a matter of right by the SpecialCounsel.Section 68.16 governs the scope of discovery and provides for orders toprotect a party from annoyance, harassment, embarrassment, oppression,undue burden or expense. A commenter suggested that the regulations berevised to impose a requirement limiting the number of interrogatoriesand other discovery requests. Section 68.16 has been revised to clarifythe Administrative Law Judge's authority to limit the frequency or extentof the discovery methods upon his/her initiative or upon motion by a party.In addition, a party may move for a protective order under this section.Section 68.16 has also been revised to remove a provision allowing certaindiscovery stipulations.Sections 68.17, 68.18, and 68.19, which deal with written interrogatories,requests for production of documents, things, inspection of land, and admissions,were revised to eliminate the unnecessary burden and expense of filingsuch documents and answers thereto with the Administrative Law Judge.One commenter expressed concern about the costs associated with adjudicationof section 274A of the INA recordkeeping violations. Specifically, concernswere expressed about costs incurred regarding: (1) Answering each allegationof the complaint; (2) pleading facts supporting affirmative defenses; (3)responding to a variety of discovery requests; (4) responding to any motionsor subpoenas arising from the discovery process; (5) responding to anymotions for summary decision; and (6) hearing and participating at theformal hearing. It was suggested that the procedures for adjudication ofsection 274A recordkeeping and indemnity bond violations be ``streamlined.''After careful consideration, it was determined that the final rules willnot reflect ``different'' procedures for recordkeeping and indemnity bondcases than for other section 274A cases. These rules were promulgated primarilyfor the purpose of establishing an equitable and orderly procedure forconducting a hearing or proceeding under sections 274A and 274B of theINA. Accordingly, certain costs associated with adhering to the rules ofpractice are unavoidable. Moreover, andSection; 68.16 provides the partieswith protective remedies in the event discovery becomes unduly burdensomeor expensive.A commenter suggested that discovery be governed by Rule 16 of the FederalRules of Criminal Procedure in section 274A cases where the governmentis prosecuting the respondent in collateral criminal proceedings (and wherethe respondent asserts a potential for criminal prosecution arising fromthe same facts alleged in the civil complaint). Since proceedings undersection 274A are civil in nature, the existing discovery rules patternedafter the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are both appropriate and efficient.The rules provide for an exchange of information not otherwise availableand thereby make for a fairer proceeding. Where there has been a criminalinvestigation reasonably likely to result in a prosecution or when a prosecutionis imminent, a section 274A respondent is afforded protections similarto those available in a civil proceeding in a United States district court.Most importantly, there is nothing novel or extraordinary about the juxtapositionof civil and criminal liability arising out of identical circumstances.Vulnerability of respondents in civil proceedings to criminal prosecutionhas existed under the jurisdiction of many Federal agencies for a considerablenumber of years. Any problem in this respect is best treated on a case-by-casebasis.It was also suggested that in cases where the proposed fine is $10,000or less, and the respondent qualifies as a small employer within the meaningof the Equal Access to Justice Act, that no pre-trial discovery be allowed.The Administrative Conference of the United States (ACUS) in recommendingthat agencies provide for prehearing discovery in adjudicatory proceedingsstated that discovery ``insures that the parties to the proceeding haveaccess to all relevant, unprivileged information prior to hearing.'' 1CFR 305.70-4. The ACUS noted that the primary objectives of discovery includea more expeditious hearing, the encouragement of settlement between theparties, and greater fairness in adjudication. <T3>Id.</T3> An exception to the discovery rules for small employers iscontrary to such objectives and will not be created. Moreover, an exceptionis unnecessary because under section 68.16 any party may seek a protectiveorder from the Administrative Law Judge if discovery becomes oppressive.Section 68.20(c) dealing with taking and receiving depositions in evidenceis revised to allow witnesses to waive signature of depositions. This isa common practice and this revision is included for the convenience ofthe witness and his/her attorney.Section 68.23, which deals with subpoenas, is revised to clarify the AdministrativeLaw Judges' statutory power to issue subpoenas for investigatory purposesprior to and subsequent to the filing of a complaint. We note that theAdministrative Law Judges' authority to issue subpoenas under andSection;68.23 and section 274A(e) of the INA does not restrict the Immigrationand Naturalization Service's concurrent authority to issue subpoenas pursuantto section 235 of the INA.Section 68.25 deals with continuances and subsection (c) is revised tomake the timeframes for filing a continuance consistent with the timeframeset forth in subsection (b).Section 68.31, which deals with appearances and representation, was revisedand reorganized for clarification purposes.Section 68.32 states that the Office of the Chief Administrative HearingOfficer does not have the authority to appoint legal counsel. The interimfinal rules stated that such office did not have the authority to appointcounsel or refer parties to counsel. One commenter expressed concern thata prohibition from providing parties with referrals to lawyers was undulybroad because it would apply not only to employer sanctions cases but tohearings regarding individuals who allege unfair immigration-related employmentpractices. It was suggested that the provision be revised to include referralsto legal services programs to individuals who allege unfair immigration-relatedemployment practices. Section 68.32 has been revised, and the prohibitionregarding referrals to lawyers has been removed. Section 68.32 of the finalrules will not include a requirement that parties be provided with referralsto lawyers.Section 68.46 deals with the record of hearings and was revised to establishthe length of time permitted for filing corrections of the original transcript.In addition, this provision was revised to eliminate the requirement ofa written record in cases which are terminated by consent or settlementorder. The revision removes the unnecessary administrative burden of retainingthe record in cases terminated by the parties.Section 68.51 was revised to remove language requiring that upon issuanceof a final order by an Administrative Law Judge in a section 274A case,a copy of the decision and the record of proceeding be forwarded to theChief Administrative Hearing Officer for such review as he/she deems appropriate.This section was revised to improve administrative efficiency. The finalrule retains the procedure whereby a party may request review of an AdministrativeLaw Judge's decision within five days of the date of decision.One commenter suggested that review by the Chief Administrative HearingOfficer does not adequately insure independent and impartial review ofAdministrative Law Judges' orders because such official's responsibilityfor supervision of Administrative Law Judges will increase the probabilityof bias or prejudice in favor of Administrative Law Judges' orders. Itwas suggested that final administrative review of Administrative Law Judges'final orders be assigned to an individual or panel with no review authorityover immigration-related matters and no responsibility for the supervisionof Administrative Law Judges. The commenter's suggestions were carefullyreviewed, but rejected because there is no indication that general supervisionof Administrative Law Judges has created bias or prejudice in favor ofthe Administrative Law Judges' orders. Concern was also expressed thatthese rules make administrative review of orders unlikely because reviewis conducted only at the discretion of the Chief Administrative HearingOfficer and only if that individual acts within 30 days. The ImmigrationReform and Control Act of 1986 mandates that the administrative reviewbe completed within 30 days of the date of decision. Thus, the 30-day periodcannot be extended by regulatory revision. It was suggested that the rulesbe revised to make administrative review mandatory in section 274A cases.The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 clearly does not providefor mandatory administrative review in section 274A cases.Section 68.52 deals with the filing of the official record and removesthe interim final rules requirement that the Chief Administrative HearingOfficer certify and file the record. This revision was made in order toimprove administrative efficiency.A commenter suggested that the final regulations include a provision providinginterpreters for non-English speaking parties in section 274B hearings.The commenter further suggested that interpreters be provided at the Government'sexpense to indigent section 274B complainants. There is no statutory requirementto provide interpreters at section 274B hearings and such a generally applicablerequirement would unduly burden the Government.This is not a major rule within the meaning of Executive Order No. 12291.In accordance with 5 U.S.C. 605(b), the Attorney General certifies thatthis rule will not have a signficant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities because it is procedural in nature.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 28 CFR Part 68</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Aliens, Citizenship and naturalization,Civil rights, Discrimination in employment, Employment, Equal employmentopportunity, Immigration, Nationality, Non-Discrimination.Accordingly, part 68 is revised as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 68_RULES OF PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGSBEFORE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES IN CASES INVOLVING ALLEGATIONS OF UNLAWFULEMPLOYMENT OF ALIENS AND UNFAIR IMMIGRATION-RELATED EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.1 Scope of rules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.3 Service of complaint, notice of hearing, written orders, anddecisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.4 Notice of date, time, and place of hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.5 Service of filing of documents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.6 Form of pleadings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.7 Time Computations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.8 Responsive pleadings_answer.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.9 Motions and requests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.10 Prehearing statements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.11 Conferences.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.12 Consent findings or dismissal.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.13 Intervenor in unfair immigration-related employment cases.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.14 Consolidation of hearings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.15 Amicus curiae. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.16 Discovery_general provisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.17 Written interrogatories to parties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.18 Production of documents, things, and inspection of land.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.19 Admissions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.20 Depositions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.21 Motion to compel response to discovery; sanctions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.22 Use of depositions at hearings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.23 Subpoenas.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.24 Designation of Administrative Law Judge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.25 Continuances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.26 Authority of Administrative Law Judge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.27 Unavailability of Administrative Law Judge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.28 Disqualification.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.29 Separation of functions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.30 Expedition.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.31 Appearances and representation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.32 Legal assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.33 Standards of conduct.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.34 Ex parte communications.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.35 Waiver of right to appear and failure to participate or to appear.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.36 Motion for summary decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.37 Formal hearings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.38 Evidence.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.39 Official notice.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.40 In camera and protective orders.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.41 Exhibits.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.42 Records in other proceedings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.43 Designation of parts of documents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.44 Authenticity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.45 Stipulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.46 Record of hearings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.47 Closing the record.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.48 Receipt of documents after hearing.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.49 Restricted access.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.50 Decision and order of the Administrative Law Judge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.51 Administrative and judicial review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">68.52 Filing of the official record.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 5 U.S.C. 301; 5 U.S.C. 554; 8 U.S.C. 1103; 8 U.S.C.1324 a and b.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 68.1 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope of rules.</ITAG>These rules of practice are generally applicable to adjudicatory proceedingsbefore Administrative Law Judges of the Executive Office of ImmigrationReview, United States Department of Justice, with regard to unlawful employmentcases and unfair immigration-related employment practice cases under sections274A and 274B of the INA.
