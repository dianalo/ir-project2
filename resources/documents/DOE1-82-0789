SOLERGY predicts the annual energyproduced by a plant and can be used in design optimization studies toevaluate alternative plant designs or operating strategies. This reportvalidates SOLERGY by comparing its prediction of annual energy with theactual performance of the Solar One power plant during 1985. SOLERGYreliably estimates annual energy production, provided good estimatesof user-supplied parameters on the plant's operation are available. Thecode's predictions of plant performance on clear days agree well withthe actual performance. However, the code tends to overestimate the performanceon partly cloudy days because of the use of 15-minute average insolationdata and its failure to account for actions taken by the plant's operators.Possible applications of the code and a discussion of the sensitivityof results to uncertainty in key input parameters are presented. 28 refs.,28 figs., 19 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
