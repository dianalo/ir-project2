Credit Lyonnais Chairman Jean-Maxime Leveque said that he is leaving his job despite a previously stated desire to stay on at the government-owned bank. As reported, Mr. Leveque's outspoken support for France's former center-right government, and his advocacy of a return of Credit Lyonnais to the private sector, had alienated Socialists, who now control government.    Government officials had said last month that Mr. Haberer, a widely respected former senior Finance Ministry official without any known political affiliation, would be named to replace Mr. Leveque. </TEXT></DOC>
