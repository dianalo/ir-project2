Based on the requirements of expressibility,buildability, computer-usability, and expandability, a device in thecircuit domain is modeled as a hierarchically arranged set of subpartsfrom both logical and physical perspectives. A new mechanism for connectingcomponents is developed to preserve the special features of wires andpoints of contact so as to make the common connection problems diagnosable.The idea of an expandable component library is introduced. The work leadsto a device-representation formalism, which not only provides the systemwith necessary knowledge for diagnosing a wide range of faults,but alsomakes the system adaptable to new devices, e.g., different circuits inthe electronic domain. The representation scheme was used to representsa six-channel pulse-code modulation board for telecommunications andseveral adder/multiplier boards in a fault-diagnosis system, which successfullylocates the faults on these devices. The research results in a betterunderstanding of knowledge-representation issues in versatile fault diagnosis,and provides a prototype of developing device representation schemesfor such systems in both circuit and non-circuit domains.</TEXT></DOC>
