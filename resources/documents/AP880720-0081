Assailants hurled a grenade and opened fire on the soldiers asthey were leaving a discotheque in a rented van early Sunday in SanPedro Sula, 125 miles northwest of Tegucigalpa. Three othersoldiers in the van were not hurt.   One of the six was treated and released Sunday. The other fivewere in good condition Tuesday at the hospital at Palmerola AirBase, headquarters for U.S. operations, U.S. Embassy spokesmanCharles Barclay said.   The Cinchonero People's Liberation Movement said in a statementdistributed to local newspapers Tuesday that its ``LempiraCommand'' attacked the soldiers in ``memory of the first Honduranwar chief who led an armed resistance against foreign invaders.''   Lempira was a Mayan Indian chief who fought against Spanishconquerors.   ``As long as there is a Yankee military and Nicaraguancounterrevolutionary presence here there will never be peace,'' theguerrilla group's communique said.   The United States maintains about 1,500 troops at Palmerola andhas conducted military exercises with Honduras since 1982.   Honduras also has permitted Contra rebels to maintain base campsin Honduras in their seven-year war to oust Nicaragua's leftistSandinista government.   Col. Lazaro Avila Soleno, commander of the Honduran army's 105thinfantry brigade in San Pedro Sula, said officials had no leads inthe case.   ``We consider the attack an isolated action whose investigationwill follow the course of the law to provide tranquility to thecitizens,'' he said.   Newspapers said Tuesday that secret police had arrested sixpeople in the case. Military intelligence sources said FBI agentswere in San Pedro Sula to work on the case.   The Cinchonero guerrillas emerged in 1979 as the first armedgroup of the Honduran Communist Party, which has operatedunderground since it was founded in 1950.   Authorities blame the group for more than 10 terrorist attackson U.S. companies in Honduras, hijacking three commercial airlinersbetween 1979 and 1983 and the kidnappings of businessmen.</TEXT></DOC>
