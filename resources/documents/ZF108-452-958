 The 1990 AIIM Conference and Show (April 9-12 atChicago's McCormick Place East) featured the latest microfilm units in thesame hall as a newer technology, digital imaging.andP;  Call the new guys&quot;electronic image management systems,&quot; &quot;document image processors,&quot; &quot;opticalfiling systems&quot; or whatever; these systems use computers to store andretrieve digitized images of documents, and the AIIM Show demonstrated thatthey are now serious competition for micrographics.andM;Analog vs.andP;  DigitalandM;From a broader perspective, the digital imaging products are really out tochallenge or absorb the entire domain of repository management, includingfiling cabinets, photocopiers and fax machines, as well as the microfilmsystems.andP;  This competition between the (mostly) analog present and thedigital future creates the underlying dialectic of the AIIM Show.andM;The digital imaging systems vendors have chosen strong allies; documentimaging is joining forces with general-purpose computer systems, from PCs tomainframes.andP;  The relation is a symbiotic one: imaging enhances thefunctionality of existing information systems while building on the sameplatforms and sharing the same components as other applications.andM;The universal success of fax (like the triumph of analog xerographic copiers20 years earlier) has driven home the usefulness of document images inbusiness.andP;  The quick spread of the fax machine (a digitalscanner/printer/modem combination) is also an indication of how neglected thecapacity to deal with pictures of pages has been, until recently, in existingcomputer systems.andP;  But that is changing.andM;The double &quot;I&quot; in AIIM's name is testimony to the growing affinity betweenimaging and other information processing functions.andP;  The AIIM show this yearconfirms the judgment that continuing to separate records management, officeautomation, reprographics and data processing activities within organizationswill be difficult.andM;A quick impression.andP;  Computer-based document image systems were shown in manyof the 250 or so booths at the AIIM Show.andP;  Digital imaging systems wereestablished in the mid-1980s, but this year's show was a bit of Tomorrowland,when systems will make heavy use of the familiar desktop publishingcomponents of today: personal computers, scanners, laser printers andoversized high-resolution monitors.andM;The document imaging process includes digital raster scanning of documents,storage of compressed bitmapped page images, page display on PC monitors orgraphics terminals, output of document images to laser printers or othergraphics printers, and maintenance of an online catalog (database) describingthe documents and facilitating retrieval by multiple search &quot;keys.&quot;andM;The imaging exhibits at AIIM hammered away at the major functions andbenefits of electronic document management:andM;* Flexible search procedures locate needed documents more readily because ofcross-indexed cataloging.andM;* Rapid automated document retrieval improves productivity and producesbetter customer service.andM;* Annotation of static documents replaces stapled and paper clipped notesthat may accompany the file.andM;* Relatively permanent media (10 to 100 years storage duration is claimed forWORM), perfect duplication of files when needed, along with no periodicmaintenance, mean low-cost, low-risk, long-term retention.andM;* Elimination of labor-intensive manual refiling and paper handling alsomeans the end of temporarily misplaced, damaged or permanently lost documentsand the costs associated with these.andM;* Shared electronic access to documents ends wasteful searching for &quot;who hasthe Jones file?&quot; or expensive creation of redundant (photocopied) filingsystems.andM;* Electronic communication of document images to remote computers and faxmachines is accomplished with fewer steps if the document already exists in adigital image file.andM;* Minimal space requirements compared to paper filing cabinets and storagerooms save expensive floor space.andM;* Preservation of artwork, signatures, handwritten notes, photographs,foreign language text and technical drawings is a valuable supplement tofiles stored as computer text or data only.andM;* The ability to capture, retrieve and circulate externally originateddocuments such as incoming correspondence or customer purchase ordersreplaces circulating documents with &quot;buck slips,&quot; multiple-part forms andother methods that may be too slow for today's competitive business climate.andM;To illustrate these benefits, the systems in Chicago were demonstratedscanning, storing, retrieving, displaying, printing, faxing and manipulatingnearly every application imaginable--business correspondence, engineeringdrawings, forms of all kinds, invoices, sales orders, insurance claim files,bank checks, technical documentation, loan applications, real estate listingswith photographs, personnel records, mug shots and medical charts, etc.andM;The quality of the document images that were displayed or printed out rangedfrom coarse (like a &quot;normal mode&quot; fax with no extra bits for gray-scaleinformation) to what might pass for a very good photocopy (in the printedoutput, at least).andP;  Because screen resolution, even on a full-page monitor,is significantly lower than the 200--400 dpi of the typical stored image, theway to get the benefit of the full detail of the stored image on the screenis to &quot;zoom in&quot; and magnify an area of the document electronically.andP;  Colorscanning and output were also demonstrated (by DeltaTech and ImageeringOptical Disk Systems).andM;The role of optical storage.andP;  A raster image of a single page of an 8-1/2&quot; X11&quot; business letter at 200-300 dpi may require 50-150 kilobytes of storage,even in a compressed format such as CCITT Group 3 or Group 4.andP;  An E-sizeengineering document, even with file compression, might require a megabyte ormore of disk space.andP;  New storage technologies, especially optical disc driveswith removable cartridges, are therefore needed to store the large volume ofdata represented by page images.andP;  That is why digital document storagesystems are often referred to as &quot;optical storage and retrieval&quot; or simply&quot;optical disc&quot; systems.andM;WORM (write once, read many times) optical discs are the most popular mediafor digital image systems, because they are cost efficient and because theinability to erase is an advantage in this application.andP;  The newer erasablediscs are also being selected for some imaging applications where documentsare changed frequently or have a short useful life; drives that can use botherasable and WORM media are expected to be released in the near future.andO;Optical drives using 5-1/4&quot; cartridges have become readily available in thelast two years, at much lower prices per drive than the 12&quot; or 14&quot;subsystems.andP;  The Panasonic LF5010 WORM, for example, sells for about $4,000for a PC or a macintosh and stores 940 megabytes, counting both sides, on aremovable 5-1/4&quot; cartridge priced at $150.andM;Read-only formats, especially CDROM, can also be used for document imaging,but are only economical in a publishing mode: where the same database withimages, such as a catalog or service manual, is to be distributed to multiplesites.andP;  The CD-ROM world was not much in evidence at AIIM this year, althoughCD-ROM data preparation/retrieval shell packages such as TMS InnerView andPersonal Library Software's Personal Librarian were represented.andM;Back to WORM: A single optical WORM drive of the current generation stores300 megabytes (at the low end of the 5-1/4&quot; drives) to 3.2 gigabytes online(i.e., per side of a removable double sided Sony cartridge) at the high endof the 12-inchers.andP;  The capacity range is something like 3,000-10,000 pageimages online for current 5-1/4&quot; WORM drives in general, to 30,000-60,000page images on line for the highest-density 12&quot; drive.andM;In larger-scale imaging systems, &quot;jukebox&quot; devices are used to fetch thecartridges from storage slots, insert them into a drive, or flip them over toaccess data on the other side.andP;  Such jukeboxes (or &quot;autochangers&quot; as someprefer) can give the system &quot;near line&quot; access to anywhere from 6 gigabytesto over 300 gigabytes.andP;  Most jukeboxes require less than ten seconds, onaverage, to retrieve and display a page image from a multiple-disk library ofup to several million pages.andM;Other technologies for massive data access were also demonstrated, includingMasstor's helical scan magnetic tape jukebox for IBM mainframes, amillion-dollar device that can store up to four terabytes near line, and&quot;optical paper,&quot; a flexible high-density optical medium from ICI Imagedatathat is being designed into both disk and tape formats, and may at some pointcompete with the rigid-media optical drives and jukeboxes.andM;Hardware and softwareandM;A typical document image system, 1990 vintage, has the following components:andM;* At least one optical drive, from a manufacturer like Panasonic, Sony,Mitsubishi, Pioneer, ricoh, Optimem, Toshiba, Laser Magnetic Storage (LMSI),LaserDrive/ISI and others, using drivers for specific operating systems andsubsystems for specific platforms developed by companies such as Corel,Optisys, Alphatronix, MDI, AGA, Maxtor, Pinnacle and others.andM;* Compression and decompression modules, which can be implemented in rasterimage processor hardware boards from companies such as Kofax, Xionics, MicroMachines, IMNET, LaserData and AutoGraph International, or in software fromTMS, LaserData and others, or in proprietary software limited to a particularimaging system.andM;* A video display card and monitor of at least VGA resolution, and often afull-page or two-page monochrome monitor from vendors such as Moniterm, SigmaDesigns or Cornerstone.andM;* A laser printer from the usual suspects such as Hewlett-Packard, Canon,Ricoh.andP;  Usually these require an accelerator board such as the Kofaxmultifunction raster image processor, or such as the speedup boards byLaserMaster or JRL (which do not include the compression/decompressionmodules).andM;* For engineering drawings, either an electrostatic plotter/printer or athermal output device and an appropriately large-format scanner.andM;* For business documents, a page scanner, often a flatbed scanner withautomatic document feeder from manufacturers like Fujitsu, Canon, Panasonic,Ricoh, Hewlett-Packard and TDC.andM;* At least one PC or workstation, such as a '286 or '386 MS-DOS or OS/2system, a Mac II, a Sun, an Apollo, a Data General Aviion, etc.andM;* Document image management software, including the user interface, documentdatabase manager and possibly the compression/decompression utilities.andM;* A large magnetic hard drive to contain the document database manager withassociated records and indexes.andM;Optional components include:andM;* An optical disc jukebox from Cygnet, Sony, Kodak, IDE, Panasonic,Plasmon/Reflection Systems, Mitsubishi, Ricoh or NKK, possibly using softwareutilities from driver specialists such as Corel, Optisys or AAP.andM;* LAN and/or host mini or mainframe connections.andM;* Separate servers for the database management and jukebox control.andM;* Software and hardware provisions for fax input and output, including a faxboard.andM;* Software and hardware for editing the images or converting them tononraster formats, such as OCR modules from Calera or Caere, orraster-to-vector conversion modules.andM;* In the future, expect digital photocopiers to be used as I/O devices insome imaging systems.andM;Dollars and cents.andP;  A complete single-user, single optical drive, &quot;unbundled&quot;imaging system might be pieced together from exhibited components for anend-user price as little as $20,000, perhaps configured around a $2,000-rangesoftware package such as MARVIN (ImageTech) for an MS-DOS machine.andP;  Even moreaggressively priced software is available; examples include Alexsys EZ(Courtland Marketing) and FileRoom (Deerfield Systems).andP;  Relativelyinexpensive software, such as Arc-IMAGE (First Financial Technology) at$1,595, also exists for the Mac II family.andP;  Selecting the hardware andintegrating the components would be similar to putting together a desktoppublishing system around software like Ventura or PageMaker and indeed coulduse many of the same components.andM;Bundled single-user systems from respected vendors (e.g.andP;  Kodak, Bell andamp;Howell, Minolta, TAB, LaserData, MicroDynamics, Summit) are more likely to bequoted at $40,000 to $60,000 for letter and legal size documents, althoughCanon's Canofile (not yet deliverable) has a price tag under $20,000.andM;For engineering drawings, a basic standalone image storage and retrievalsystem starts at about $50,000 (using elements such as the Contex/Vemco/Idealscanner and ViewBase software from Image Systems) but climbs quickly to$125,000 or above with higher-performance components and some bells andwhistles from companies such as Intergraph, Cimage, GTX, Optigraphics,Spicer, Access, Unisys or ViewStar.andM;Add a LAN, some netstations, a jukebox, a server or two and integrate theimaging application with existing mainframe-based data processingapplications and the system can cost hundreds of thousands to millions ofdollars to purchase and install.andP;  Then add to the budget the cost forbackfile conversion of paper or microfilm documents and the ongoing cost ofscanning and indexing the new documents that are being added.andP;  Obviously, thecosts as well as the payoffs can be substantial.andM;Trends and developmentsandM;In their recent history, digital document image systems seem to haverecapitulated many of the same directions taken by the evolution of wordprocessing and digital publishing systems.andP;  Notably, by 1990, imaging systemshave become more integrated into the rest of the computer world than in thepast, when dedicated imaging stations, non-standard operating systems, lackof connectivity, proprietary hardware and bundled software were the rule.andM;Imaging on standard platforms.andP;  As in the publishing marketplace, standardoperating systems and user interfaces are the rule now.andM;* MS-DOS based imaging software includes products from LaserData, IdentiTech(AIMS), Summit, ImageTech (MARVIN), TAB, Distributed Image SystemsCorporation (Discorp), DeltaTech, Advanced IDAS, Micronet (Office View) andVision Information Systems (First Trac).andM;* Two OS/2 Presentation Manager products were exhibited: Imara Desktop fromImara Corporation and Unite by Cirrus Technology.andM;* Macintosh-based document image software includes offerings fromMicroDynamics (MARS); Conversion Dynamics (CD*Star); VisionShape (Image PAC);First Financial Technology (ArcIMAGE); CSX Technology (Visualink, which usesMac image workstations and a Vax 3800 database server); and DuPont (FastTraxengineering drawing management system).andM;* Vendors using Unix servers in some of their configurations include GenesisImaging Technologies, Access, Image Business Systems (with IBM AIX servers),IMIX and Ricoh (Ricohbase, using X-Window terminals).andP;  REI and FileQuest bothpresented imaging software compatible with the Data General Aviion servers.andO;Hewlett-Packard demonstrated the HP Advanced Image Management System for itsHP9000's running HP/UX.andP;  HP uses DOS PCs (HP Vectras) as user stations.andM;Graphical user interfaces such as Microsoft Windows for DOS and PresentationManager for OS/2 are being widely adopted for imaging systems.andP;  Products suchas FileQuest that were originally introduced without Windows support are nowbeing released under Windows (and in FileQuest's case, OSF/Motif).andP;  OtherWindows-compatible products include ImageTech's MARVIN, Minolta's M3MS 1000,ViewStar VS*Retrieve, Wang Laboratories Open/Image architecture, HP AdvancedImage Management System.andM;Standard peripheral components.andP;  This trend includes replacing proprietaryhardware with generic components and also replacing hardware with software.andO;For example, Wang announced Freestyle/Light, a software-only implementationof Freestyle.andM;The typical MS-DOS based document imaging software now has compatibility withVGA displays, and can perform compression and decompression without a specialRIP board.andP;  A VGA monitor can readably display half a page at a time.andP;  Thismakes document images available on a network to &quot;casual&quot; imaging users, andgreatly reduces the cost of LAN-based imaging implementations.andM;Standard query languages.andP;  There is no doubt that managing document databasesis much easier with the emerging standard database systems and querylanguages such as SQL or Oracle.andP;  The resurrected Plexus, for example,provides Plexus XDP (Extended Data Processing) imaging utilities based onstandards like MS-Windows, Unix, SQL and Ethernet.andM;Standard file formats.andP;  CCITT image compression standards (Group 3 and Group4), also used in fax transmission, are widely used in document imaging.andP;  Fileheaders, used to specify the image file format of the data that follows them,are not yet standardized, but there is some progress toward using standardslike TIFF.andM;Connectivity, with other workstations and with mainframe-based corporateinformation systems, is a must.andP;  This year just about every imaging softwarepackage or bundled system exhibited at AIIM is (or shortly will be) availablein a version compatible with at least one LAN operating system.andM;Connectivity with mainframe or minicomputer systems (IBM S/370 and AS/400,DEC Vax, Wang VS) is featured in the product lines of a number of vendorssuch as IBM, with Image Plus; Wang, with WIIS, Freestyle, and Open/Image; orDEC with its new DECImage utilities.andP;  Also involved in connectivity withtimesharing hosts are ViewStar, Metafile, LaserData, Plexus, FileNet,Alpharel, Perceptics, TAB, Intergraph, Sigma Imaging Systems, COM SquaredSystems, Minolta, ATandamp;T and Compu Soft.andM;Typically, microcomputers on a LAN are the document retrieval and documentcapture stations, with mainframe links moving data rather than images.andO;&quot;Dumb&quot; graphics terminals and standard terminal communications links (3270,5250, etc.) are not at this point used for document image display, though DEChas announced the VT1000 I, which has been adapted to document imaging.andM;Multipurpose workstations.andP;  Since generic platforms are now used to runimaging software, and since these workstations are being connected with eachother and with larger timesharing systems, each imaging station (awell-equipped PC or Macintosh, for example) has in effect evolved into amultipurpose workstation, able to run other applications and to communicatewith a host mainframe in terminal emulation mode.andP;  To the extent that theemerging multitasking environments permit these activities to proceedsimultaneously, the user will be able to integrate document image informationwith data from several other sources, such as spreadsheet files, wordprocessing files, and mainframe databases.andM;Further processing of image data.andP;  Here the goal is to transform images intoformats than can be manipulated by standard computer applications.andP;  Forexample:andM;1) OCR conversion of document images.andP;  It is relatively easy to scan adocument once and store it in two formats: image and text.andP;  This is becauseOCR (optical character recognition), which converts documents to computerreadable text, requires raster scanning as its first stage anyway.andP;  Rasterdocument image files not initally processed by an OCR module can therefore beconverted to ASCII at any time, if the format is compatible with the OCRsystem.andP;  Another way to end up with a document in both text and image formatis to retain and compress the initial raster file that is usually discardedin an OCR scan.andM;The advantages of storing a document as both image and computer readable textare enormous, and appear to be growing more common in document managementsystems.andP;  The ASCII version of the document can of course be further editedand formatted.andP;  More importantly from the standpoint of retrieval, the textcan be searched for content and even pre-indexed so that the content searchdoes not have to be done in real time by the full-text search module.andM;Full-text search can thus supplement the structured database record fordocument searches.andP;  In some applications it may even obviate entirely theneed for keyboard entry of fielded information or key words, thus eliminatingthe most labor intensive aspects of electronic document management: thecataloging and database entry stages.andM;Retaining the original image, linked to the text version, adds the advantagesof accuracy, which is likely to be compromised in the OCR version, andpreservation of the elements of the original document, like graphics, thatcannot be conveyed by OCR.andP;  In the ideal system, the two forms of the samepage could be viewed simultaneously.andM;A number of companies are working on variations of this promisingimage-and-text approach: Compulink Management Center (LaserFiche); Micronet(OfficeView); MicroDynamics (MARS); Neotech (Motif); Decision ManagementCompany (Questys); Advanced Projects International/RJO (DARS); and ComputerChallenge Corporation (Image Base).andM;2) Raster editing and markup.andP;  For engineering drawings, many companies wouldfind it attractive to be able to convert hand-drafted drawings to electronicformat if this would facilitate further modifications.andP;  Short of completeconversion to vector (CAD) formats, several systems vendors provide rasterediting tools that can, for example, erase areas of the drawing and overlaythe raster image with vector layers.andP;  Changes can thereby be made withCAD-like tools, superimposing the new information on the document image,without completely redrawing the original document.andM;Vendors with software and hardware products that support engineering documentimage storage with viewing, editing, and markup features include AccessCorporation, Auto-Trol Technology, Cimage, DuPont, FileNet, Formtek, GTX,Image Systems, Optigraphics, Unisys, ViewStar, Xerox and Spicer.andM;3) Raster-to-vector conversion, to transform engineering drawings and thelike completely into a vector format, is still in its infancy.andP;  Engineeringdrawing systems specialists such as GTX, Intergraph and Scorpion Technologiessell systems that apparently can save enough expensive labor steps to be costefficient for some applications.andM;Tools.andP;  Imaging workstations, once used just to store and retrieve documents,are becoming tools for routing, scheduling and coordinating both routinepaperwork and creative collaboration.andP;  Document imaging systems are now beingmarketed with buzzwords like &quot;work flow&quot; and &quot;forms processing.&quot;andP;  In effectthey are presented as the Twenty-first Century assembly lines of thepaperless &quot;paper factory,&quot; able to route, queue, prioritize, coordinate andmonitor the flow of documents to workers for proper processing.andP;  ModernTimes, indeed.andM;Companies implementing the &quot;work flow&quot; concept include FileNet, Sigma ImagingSystems, ViewStar and Imix.andM;Vertical packages.andP;  As vendors gain experience with imaging in the context ofparticular industries, there is a profiration of industry-specific productsdesigned to meet specialized needs.andP;  There are lots of examples:andM;* Image systems have been developed specifically to cope with the very highvolume of checks processed by the banking industry.andP;  These include the UnisysInfoImage Item Processing System and the IBM ImagePlus High PerformanceTransaction System.andM;* For the financial services sector, Citicorp InsureLink has developedInSight.andM;* Pharmaceutical laboratory records are handled by the Genesis PharmaceuticalLaboratory Records System.andM;* Utility companies can have a tailored system designed by Image MemorySystems.andM;* Attorneys with complex cases involving many documents are offered theIntellex litigation support package from TechLaw Systems.andM;* County government also has a vertical package, ISIS from TriCity ComputerConsultants.andM;IBM featured ImagePlus applications for a number of specific industries:insurance, state and local government, printing and advertising, finance,manufacturing, transportation, personnel and medical records.andM;Workgroup communication.andP;  Imaging systems are being touted as the ultimate&quot;groupware&quot; tools for mind-workers, perhaps as an alternative to the morerigid assembly-line model of office work.andP;  Access to a common electronicimage library and to image communication facilities is supposed to enhanceproductivity by improving the sharing of information and ideas among themembers of a work-group.andP;  In effect, this is image-enriched E-mail.andM;Features that facilitate collaboration include not only the ability tocapture and share paper documents electronically, but also the ability toappend electronic &quot;posted notes&quot; to the document images, to mark the imagesup with an electronic &quot;blue pencil,&quot; or even to link voice messages, CADfiles and text files to the images.andP;  Such features are supported in productsfrom Wang, ViewStar, Feith, FileQuest, and others.andM;Multimedia world.andP;  All of the preceeding verbiage describes how documentimages can be marked up, appended to, and combined with other data formats.andO;It is clear, though, that the digital imaging revolution is not happening inisolation, rather it is one more instance of the emerging digital multimediaworld--a theme familiar to Seybold Report readers.andM;Joining with document images in this enriched and perhaps unified informationenvironment will be audio (with compact discs for music and digital voicemail as current examples); still frame images captured and digitized fromvideo or video-like cameras; and full motion digital color video.andM;Far from being Buck Rogers fantasies, all of the above were presented atvarious locations on the AIIM exhibit floor.andP;  IBM, a bellwether for thecomputing industry, confirmed the multimedia future by including full motionvideo/audio/graphics/text/image products in its booths.andP;  By the timeelectronic document imaging is widely adopted, perhaps before the TwentiethCentury has ended, the images may well move and talk.andM;Bernard Banet is the owner of Optimation, a consulting and sales companyspecializing in applications that utilize optical storage devices.andP;  He hasbeen involved in consulting and sales in the computer industry since 1977.andO;Readers are invited to contact him directly at Optimation, 838 Heatherway,Ann Arbor, MI 48104; phone (313) 665-7842, fax (313) 665-7872.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
