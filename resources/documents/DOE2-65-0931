Variation of the refractive index with temperaturehas been measured for KTP and LiIO/sub 3/. It is necessary to know boththe absorption coefficient {beta} and the variation in the indexes ofrefraction with temperature change dn/dT to determine the average powerlimit of a nonlinear interaction. With the dn/dT information, it is alsopossible to estimate the temperature half width of any nonlinear interactionby calculating the variation of the phase matching condition with temperature.</TEXT></DOC>
