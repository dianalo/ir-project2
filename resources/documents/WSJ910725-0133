Will suchpractices result in a slap on the wrist or slamming of a celldoor?   Although the reversals by the Second U.S. Circuit Court ofAppeals are based on the facts of particular cases, lawyerssay they do offer some lessons for future defendants incriminal securities cases:   -- The government has to show clearly that the defendantknew a law was being broken. Ignorance of the law generallyisn't an excuse, but the court says extremely complex laws,such as tax regulations or some complicated securities rules,are another matter. &quot;The court is looking at more subjectivefactors -- intent, knowledge, good faith,&quot; says Prof. AlanBromberg of the Southern Methodist University School of Law.   -- Evidence of the allegedly illegal act must be clear-cutrather than veiled, as when conspirators speak in Street codewords or act on implicit understandings.   -- Actions are more likely to be considered crimes whenvictims are easily identifiable, such as when a broker churnsa customer's account or when manipulation of penny-stockprices wipes out a customer. Insider trading orstock-manipulation cases are subject to close appellatereview when the defendant didn't make money or the stockprice moved only slightly.   Of course, some Wall Street improprieties are still boundto land a defendant in prison, as when inside information isbought with a suitcase full of cash. But the mere incantationof the words &quot;insider trading&quot; in an indictment doesn'tnecessarily signal a successful prosecution. In acontroversial ruling a year ago, a three-judge panel of theappeals court reversed an insider-trading conviction partlybecause the person getting the tip wasn't told that theinformation was confidential. That case, against formerbroker Robert Chestman, is now under review by the fullappeals court.   Another recent reversal took place earlier this month inthe case of John Mulheren, a trader who had been convicted ofmanipulating a stock at the behest of Ivan Boesky. Theappeals court threw out Mr. Mulheren's conviction mainlybecause it felt that the conversation in which the two menallegedly agreed to a stock-manipulation scheme was&quot;cryptic.&quot;   Mr. Boesky testified that Mr. Mulheren responded &quot;Iunderstand&quot; after the arbitrager told him &quot;it would be greatif {Gulf andamp; Western Industries Inc. stock} traded at 45.&quot; Mr.Mulheren then bought 75,000 shares of the stock just beforethe market closed, causing the price to climb to $45 -- whichtriggered an agreement by Gandamp;W to buy back Mr. Boesky's hugestake.   Refusing to make the leap of faith that prosecutorswanted, the court said Mr. Mulheren's actions after theconversation didn't prove he had agreed to manipulate thestock. It added that the government should have presenteddirect evidence on what the conversation meant and that the&quot;conversation is, at best, ambiguous.&quot;   The Mulheren case, Prof. Bromberg says, offers &quot;a prettygood lesson to be learned for those who are going to go outand do it . . . and that's keep your conversations vague.&quot;   Although a gangster might be convicted if he contractedwith a hit man by using similar language -- &quot;it would begreat if Joey disappeared&quot; -- the standards are different fora crime such as stock manipulation because the act itself,buying a stock in this case, isn't necessarily illegal,lawyers say. &quot;The acts characteristic of white-collar crimeare fairly equivocal and morally neutral,&quot; says Prof. JohnCoffee of Columbia University School of Law. &quot;There's nothinginherently wrong with buying 75,000 shares of stock.&quot;   In reversing most of the convictions in thePrinceton/Newport racketeering case, which involvedtax-motivated trades, the court emphasized that defendantsmust be allowed to make a &quot;good faith&quot; defense when it comesto complicated regulations such as tax law. The court alsodiscouraged prosecutors from basing a racketeering case ontax-law violations.   Some reversals have relied on grounds that attorneys termonly marginally significant. They say that by basingreversals on such issues, the appeals court may be signalingits reluctance to see criminal prosecutions in somewhite-collar cases.   For instance, the appeals court reversed the convictionsin the GAF Corp. stock-manipulation case because the trialjudge erred in not admitting as evidence the so-called billof particulars -- a table of contents of the allegations andfacts -- from an earlier version of the case. Attorneys saythe bill of particulars is rarely an issue; in a dissentingopinion, one appellate judge noted that bills of particularsusually aren't admissible as evidence.   Some attorneys contend that the court bent over backwardsto find a way to reverse the convictions because it didn'tfavor criminal charges in such a convoluted case. (Thedefendants disclaimed responsibility for the alleged stockmanipulation.) &quot;I wouldn't be surprised if the court said,`Let's get rid of this case,' and picked a technical,unassailable way to do it,&quot; Prof. Bromberg says. The case hadbeen tried -- and ended in mistrials -- twice before.   Another problem in complicated securities cases is that itmay not be clear why the act should be illegal in the firstplace. The appeals court noted that Mr. Mulheren took a$64,000 loss on the Gandamp;W transactions. &quot;This is hardly theresult a market manipulator seeks to achieve,&quot; the court saidin its decision, disregarding government claims that what hegot was a chance to stay in Mr. Boesky's good graces.   Says Andrew Frey, the appellate lawyer for Mr. Mulheren:&quot;Prosecutors sometimes forget, in their enthusiasm forcorrecting the bad practices of Wall Street, that theregulation is for stopping fraud, and fraud means cheatingpeople.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
