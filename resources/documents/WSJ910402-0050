But thespokesman said the SEC document &quot;doesn't mean he is going tosell the shares, or has any plans to do so.&quot; Mr. Iacocca, 66years old, is further limited by laws that make it impossiblefor top corporate executives to sell shares in theircompany's stock so close to the end of a quarter.
