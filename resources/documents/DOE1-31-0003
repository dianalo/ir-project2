However,it is the overall package which a company can offer which determinesthe technology used, finance, delivery and price being important factors.GEC Distribution Switchgear are trying to meet these demands by valueanalysis to provide quality-controlled cost reduction. GEC is about tolaunch an improved 11kV vacuum circuit breaker with a significant reductionin components.In the last 6 years, GEC has been reducing the number ofcomponents to give better reliability and a reduction in after-salescosts. In the UK, SF6 is still behind vacuum, but both are replacingprevious technologies. Vacuum interrupters (VIL) aims to bring down itsprices by making its interrupter smaller. Reyrolle Distribution Switchgearis about to introduce a new interrupter into its YMV, 12kV switchgear,which will make the YMV cheaper. On the SF6/vacuum market, Reyrolle believethe worldwide trend to be towards 'oil-less' technology rather than vacuumor gas. Siemens is due to launch a 63kV vacuum interrupter next year.They believe the market for SF6 and vacuum to be 'wide-open' with pricegenerally being the main criterion. Brown Boveri (BBC) aims to producemedium voltage circuit-breakers that are more like cassetted circuitbreakers available at lower voltages. BBC makes its own vacuum interrupters,and apart from using different materials, the technology is unlikelyto change. The overall conclusion is that marketing strategy may swingpreferences, but price will remain the determining factor.</TEXT></DOC>
