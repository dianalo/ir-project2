Furthermore, existing acceleratorscannot provide the combination of low cost, high energy and high electricalefficiency which is essential for many industrial users. Linear inductionaccelerators (LIAs) when combined with magnetic compressor (MC) technologysimilar to that developed at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,now offer the operating parameters, reliability and versatility requiredto meet a wide range of industrial requirements. Furthermore, LIA/MCmachines offer low operating and maintenance costs in both direct electronbeam and x-ray irradiation modes. This paper will describe the resultsof our program to develop commercial-quality LIA/MC systems. Based onhardware being developed and demonstrated under this effort, it is concludedthat LIA/MC machines offer a very attractive alternative to other typesof radiation sources for a broad range of radiation processes.</TEXT></DOC>
