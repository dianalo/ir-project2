Philips of the Netherlands are negotiating to merge their medical electronics businesses in a 50-50 venture that would be the largest player in the industry.    The proposed venture would have combined annual sales of more than $1.9 billion, topping the current world market leader in medical electronics General Electric Co. of the U.S., which is unrelated to Britain's GEC. GEC and Philips, according to a source who declined to be named, hope to reach an agreement this week.    GEC and Philips spokesmen declined to comment beyond confirming that the companies are discussing &quot;a form of cooperation.&quot;    The two businesses -- Philips's Medical Systems group and GEC's Picker International unit -- make a wide range of medical diagnostic equipment, including X-ray machines, computer-aided tomography (CAT) scanners, and magnetic resonance scanners.    The proposed merger, London financial analysts said, reflects the growing financial pressures on makers of such big-ticket medical gear. With prices for magnetic resonance scanners approaching $1 million each, cash-strapped hospitals are increasingly restraining purchases. At the same time, the manufacturers' product-development costs are rising with advances in technology.    &quot;The cost of being in the business is very high,&quot; said William Dixon, a London-based analyst for PaineWebber International Inc. &quot;If you get beyond a critical mass (in size of business), you can walk all over the competition.&quot; Together, he said, the two companies &quot;could make quite a powerful force.&quot;    Philips's medical business, about twice the size of GEC's, is primarily in Europe with 1986 sales of about $1.3 billion, according to a source. By contrast, most of GEC's medical revenues come from the U.S. and totaled $685.4 million in the fiscal year ended March 31, 1986, according to GEC's annual report. GEC reported pre-tax income for its medical business of $35.9 million. London analysts believe the Philips business is more profitable than GEC's, but a Philips spokesman declined to comment.    Under the proposed terms, the source said, each company would contribute its medical business to a 50-50 joint venture. To compensate for Philips's larger market share, GEC also would contribute cash to the enterprise. Because of the big role it would play in the U.S. medical market, the proposed venture is expected to be reviewed by U.S. antitrust regulators though the companies don't expect any government objections.    For Philips, the transaction would be the latest in a long series of joint ventures and alliances, part of a strategy to expand globally through partnerships. Philips, Europe's largest electronics company, posted 1986 sales of $26.96 billion and net income of $499.6 million.    For GEC, the partnership would be its first major new investment since losing a bitter takeover battle last year for control of its domestic electronics rival, Plessey Co. In the year ended March 31, 1986, it posted sales of $8.57 billion and net income of $739.3 million. </TEXT></DOC>
