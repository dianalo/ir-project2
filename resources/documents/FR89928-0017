This species, which was once known from theOhio, Cumberland, and Tennessee River systems, is presently known to surviveonly at a few shoals in the Clinch, Powell, and Elk Rivers, and possiblya short reach of the Tennessee and Green Rivers. The species' range hasbeen seriously restricted by the construction of impoundments and by otherimpacts to its habitat. Due to the species' limited distribution, any factorsthat adversely modify habitat or water quality in the river reaches itnow inhabits could further threaten the species.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 30, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>The complete file for this rule is available for inspection,by appointment, during normal business hours at the U.S. Fish and WildlifeService's Asheville Field Office, 100 Otis Street, Room 224, Asheville,North Carolina 28801.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Richard G.

This freshwatermussel has a thin, medium-size, elongated shell (Bogan and Parmalee 1983).The shell's outer surface is brownish green to brown and often has brokendark green rays. The nacre (inside of shell) color is pale bluish to purple.Because of its rarity, little is known of the mussel's biology. The speciesinhabits moderate-size streams on gravel riffles where it is often deeplyburied in the substrate (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). Like other freshwatermussels, it feeds by filtering food particles from the water. It has acomplex reproductive cycle in which the mussel larvae parasitize fish.The mussel's life span, fish species its larvae parasitize, and other aspectsof its life history are unknown. The cracking pearly mussel has undergone a substantial range reduction.It was historically distributed in the Ohio, Cumberland, and TennesseeRiver systems (Stansbery 1970, Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission 1980,Bogan and Parmalee 1983, Bates and Dennis 1985). The loss of populationsoccurring in these river systems was probably due to direct impacts ofimpoundments, pollution and habitat alteration, and the indirect impactsassociated with the reduction or elimination of its larval host speciesby these same factors. Based on personal communications with knowledgeablemussel experts (Steven Ahlstedt and John Jenkinson, Tennessee Valley Authority,1987; Arthur Bogan, Philadelphia Academy of Sciences, 1987; Richard Neves,Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 1987; David Stansbery,Ohio State University, 1987) and a review of current literature on thespecies (see above, plus Ahlstedt 1986), the species is definitely knownto survive in only three river reaches_the Clinch River, Hancock County,Tennessee, and Scott County, Virginia; the Powell River, Hancock County,Tennessee, and Lee County, Virginia; and the Elk River, Lincoln County,Tennessee. Although the species has not been collected in the Green River since 1966,and a survey of the Green River in Hart and Edmonson Counties in 1987 failedto collect the species, there is a possibility that an isolated populationmay still exist in the Green River (Richard Hannan, Kentucky Nature PreservesCommission, personal communication, 1988). Another small population mayalso still exist in the Tennessee River below Pickwick Dam in Hardin County,Tennessee (Paul Yokley, Jr., University of North Alabama, personal communication,1988). Live specimens have not been taken below Pickwick Dam since the1970s, but a few relic shells have been taken in the 1980s, indicatingthat a small population may still be holding on in a short reach of theTennessee River. All of the known populations and the populations that may exist in theGreen and Tennessee Rivers are threatened and are located in areas borderedprimarily by private lands. The Powell River is severely threatened bythe impacts of coal mining. The Clinch River, although in much better condition,is also impacted by coal mining, and in the past has experienced extensivefish and mussel kills caused by toxic spills from a riverside power plant.The Elk River mussel fauna has been impacted by cold-water discharges fromTims Ford Reservoir, and the Green River has had a history of water qualityproblems from oil and gas production in the watershed. The Tennessee Riverbelow Pickwick Dam has been impacted by gravel dredging, channel maintenancework, and the upstream reservoir.The cracking pearly mussel was recognized by the Service in the May 22,1984, <T4>Federal Register </T4>(49 FR 21664) as a category 2 species that wasbeing considered for possible addition to the Federal List of Endangeredand Threatened Wildlife and Plants. Category 2 is for those species forwhich the Service has some information indicating that the taxa may beunder threat, but sufficient information is lacking to prepare a proposedrule. The service has met and been in phone contact with various Federaland State agency personnel concerning the species' status and the needfor the protection provided by the Endangered Species Act. On January 14,1988, and May 16, 1988, the Service also notified appropriate Federal,State, and local governmental agencies by mail that a status review wasbeing conducted and that the species might be proposed for listing. Nonegative comments were received. On February 17, 1989, the Service published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(54 FR 7225) a proposal to list the crackingpearly mussel as an endangered species. That proposal provided informationon the species' biology, status, and threats to its continued existence.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the February 17, 1989, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports and informationthat might contribute to development of the final rule. Appropriate Federaland State agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, and interestedparties were contacted and requested to comment. A legal notice was publishedin the following newspapers: ``Elk Valley Times,'' Fayetteville, Tennessee,March 1, 1989; ``Kingsport Times News,'' Kingsport, Tennessee, March 5,1989; ``Hart County News,'' Munfordville, Kentucky, March 9, 1989; and``Savannah Courier,'' Savannah, Tennessee, March 9, 1989. A total of eight comments was received. Six respondents (Tennessee ValleyAuthority, Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, KentuckyNature Preserve Commission, Ohio Department of Natural Resources, VirginiaCommission of Game and Inland Fisheries, and one petition containing 96signatures) supported the proposed rule. Two Federal agencies, the U.S.Soil Conservation Service and the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers,indicated that the listing would not likely affect their activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a through review and consideration of all information, the Servicehas determined that the cracking pearly mussel should be classified asan endangered species. Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the EndangeredSpecies Act (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and regulations (50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implementthe listing provisions of the Act were followed. A species may be determinedto be endangered or threatened due to one or more of the five factors describedin section 4(a)(1). These factors and their application to the crackingpearly mussel (<T3>Hemistena </T3>(=<T3>Lastena</T3>) <T3>lata</T3>) are as follows: A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification, or Curtailmentof Its Habitat or Range. The cracking pearly mussel was once fairly widely distributed in the OhioRiver Basin. It ranged in the Ohio River from Ohio downstream to Illinois(Bogan and Parmalee 1983). In Indiana and Illinois it was historicallyknown from the White, Wabash, and Tippecanoe Rivers (Kevin Cummings, IllinoisState Natural History Survey Division, and Max Henschen, Mollusk TechnicalAdvisory Committee, personal communications, 1988). Kentucky records (KentuckyNature Preserves Commission 1980; Richard Hannan, personal communication,1988) show that the species once inhabited the upper Cumberland, Big SouthFork, Green, and Kentucky Rivers. The cracking pearly mussel has historicallybeen taken in Tennessee from the Tennessee, Cumberland, Powell, Clinch,Holston, Elk, Duck, and Buffalo Rivers (Bogan and Parmalee 1983, Ahlstedt1986, Bates and Dennis 1985). In Alabama, this mussel existed in the TennesseeRiver (Bogan and Parmalee 1983). Portions of the Powell, Clinch, and HolstonRivers in Virginia are also reported to have supported the species (Boganand Parmalee 1983; Charles Sledd, Virginia Commission of Game and InlandFisheries, and Michael Lipford, Virginia Department of Conservation andHistoric Resources, personal communications, 1988). Based on a literature review (see above) and personal contacts with knowledgeableFederal, State, and independent biologists, the species is presently knownto be surviving only in the Clinch River, Hancock County, Tennessee, andScott County, Virginia; the Powell River, Hancock County, Tennessee, andLee County, Virginia; and the Elk River, Lincoln County, Tennessee. Thespecies may also still survive in the Green River, Hart and Edmonson Counties,Kentucky (Richard Hannan, personal communication, 1988), and in a shortreach of the Tennessee River below Pickwick Dam, Hardin County, Tennessee(Paul Yokley, Jr., personal communication, 1988). The Powell River's population was sampled in 1979 by the Tennessee ValleyAuthority (Ahlstedt 1986). They surveyed 78 sites over about 97 river milesand found the cracking pearly mussel at only three sites. The Powell Riverwatershed is mined extensively for coal, and coal mining impacts to theriver are evident. The upper reaches of the Powell River are significantlyimpacted. The lower river reaches, which still contain a relatively diversemussel fauna, have large deposits of coal fines and silt (Ahlstedt 1986).In 1973 the section of the Powell River inhabited by the cracking pearlymussel experienced a mussel kill that may have resulted in a loss of 5percent of the mussel population (Ahlstedt and Jenkinson 1987).The Clinch River population of the cracking pearly mussel is the largestand covers the greatest river length. Ahlstedt (1986) reported the speciesfrom 16 of the 141 sites sampled in a 1978-83 Tennessee Valley Authoritysurvey that covered about 174 river miles. Although this river and itsmussel fauna are apparently healthier than the Powell, the Clinch Riverhas been adversely affected by pollution. Charles Sledd (personal communication,1988) stated that land use practices along the Clinch have contributedto the loss of water quality and decline in mussel populations. The ClinchRiver also experiences some impacts from coal mining, and the river hasbeen subjected to two mussel kills that resulted from toxic substance spillsfrom a riverside coal-fired power plant. The cracking pearly mussel was taken at only 2 of 108 sites over the 172miles of the Elk River surveyed in 1980 by the Tennessee Valley Authority(Ahlstedt 1986). The river, according to Ahlstedt (1986), has a considerableamount of suitable habitat for freshwater mussels, and a large number ofrelic shells was present. However, Ahlstedt (1986) reported that cold-waterreleases from Tims Ford Reservoir and pollution from an unknown sourcein the lower Elk River have impacted the mussel fauna, and mussel densityhas been reduced. The cracking pearly mussel has not been taken since 1966 from the GreenRiver, and a 1987 mussel survey did not find the species (Ronald Cicerello,Kentucky Nature Preserves Commission, personal communication, 1988). However,suitable habitat appears to be available in the Green River, and an isolatedpopulation may still exist there (Richard Hannan, personal communication,1988). In the Tennessee River, live specimens were taken in the 1970s belowPickwick Dam, but only relic shells have been taken in recent years. Accordingto personal communication with Dr. Paul Yokley, Jr., (1988), this species,which apparently existed only in small numbers in this river reach, couldpossibly still survive there. If populations still persist in the Tennessee River below Pickwick Damin Tennessee and the Green River in Kentucky, these populations are atrisk. The Green River's mussel fauna has been seriously depleted. Ortmann(1926) reported finding 66 species of mussels in the Green River. Isom(1974) reported only 27 species present. The Green River has been degradedby oil and gas exploration and production and by alterations of streamflow from an upstream reservoir. Any population below Pickwick Dam in theTennessee River is potentially threatened by gravel dredging, channel maintenance,and operation of Pickwick Dam. This river reach also experienced a musseldie-off in 1985 and 1986 (Ahlstedt and Jenkinson 1987). B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific, or EducationalPurposes This freshwater mussel species is not commercially valuable, but becauseof its rarity it could be sought by collectors. Thus, because of the species'restricted range, taking could be a threat to its continued existence.Federal listing would help control any indiscriminate taking of individuals.C. Disease or Predation Although the cracking pearly mussel is undoubtedly consumed by predatoryanimals, there is no evidence that predation threatens the species. However,freshwater mussel die-offs, possibly due to disease, have been reportedin recent years throughout the Mississippi River basin, including the TennesseeRiver and its tributaries (Ahlstedt and Jenkinson 1987). Significant losseshave occurred to some populations. D. The Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms The States of Kentucky, Tennessee, and Virginia prohibit taking fish andwildlife, including freshwater mussels, for scientific purposes withouta State collecting permit. However, these States' laws do not protect thespecies' habitat from the potential impacts of Federal actions. Federallisting would provide the species additional protection under the EndangeredSpecies Act by requiring a Federal permit to take the species and by requiringFederal agencies to consult with the Service when projects they fund, authorize,or carry out may adversely affect the species.E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence The Powell River and Elk River populations are small, and if the speciescontinues to exist in the Green River and Tennessee River, these populationsmust also be very limited. All the populations are geographically isolatedfrom each other. This isolation restricts the natural interchange of geneticmaterial between the populations, and the small population size reducesthe reservoir of genetic variability within the populations. It is likelythese populations, with the possible exception of the Clinch River, arenow below the generally accepted level (SouleandCx.174;1 1980) required tomaintain long-term genetic viability.The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list the cracking pearly mussel (<T3>Hemistena</T3> (=<T3>Lastena</T3>) <T3>lata</T3>) as an endangered species. Historical records reveal thatthe species, although now rare, was once widely distributed in the OhioRiver drainage. Presently only three small, isolated populations, and possiblytwo others, are known to survive. These populations are all threatenedby a variety of factors, including gravel dredging, coal mining, oil andgas resource development, and other factors that adversely impact the aquaticenvironment. Due to the species' history of population losses and the vulnerablenature of the populations, threatened status does not appear appropriatefor this species. See the following section for a discussion of why criticalhabitat is not being proposed for the cracking pearly mussel.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent anddeterminable, that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the timea species is determined to be endangered or threatened. The Service findsthat designation of critical habitat is not presently prudent for the crackingpearly mussel, owing to the lack of benefits from such designation. TheU.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Tennessee Valley Authority, and the NationalPark Service are the three Federal agencies most involved, and they, alongwith the State natural resources agencies in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia,are already aware of the location of the remaining populations that wouldbe affected by any activities in these river reaches. These Federal agencieshave conducted studies in these river basins and are knowledgeable of thefauna and of their projects' impacts. No additional benefits would accrue from critical habitat designation thatwould not also accrue from the listing of the species. In addition, thisspecies is so rare that taking for scientific purposes or private collectionscould be a threat. The publication of critical habitat maps and other informationaccompanying critical habitat designation, such as the location of inhabitedriver reaches, could increase that threat. The location of populationsof this species has consequently been described only in general terms inthis proposed rule. More precise locality data is available to appropriateFederal, State, and local governmental agencies through the Service officedescribed in the <T2>``ADDRESSES'' </T2>section. <ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionagainst taking and harm are discussed, in part, below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The Servicehas notified Federal agencies which may have programs that affect the species.Federal activities that could occur and impact the species include, butare not limited to, the carrying out or the issuance of permits for hydroelectricfacility construction and operation, reservoir construction, river channelmaintenance, stream alteration, wastewater facilities development, androad and bridge construction. It has been the experience of the Service,however, that nearly all section 7 consultations have been resolved sothat the species has been protected and the project objectives have beenmet. In fact, the areas inhabited by the cracking pearly mussel are alsoinhabited by other mussels that have been federally listed since 1976.The Service has a history of successful section 7 conflict resolutionsthat have protected the species and provided for project objectives beingmet throughout these areas. The Act and implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.21 set forth aseries of general prohibitions and exceptions that apply to all endangeredwildlife. These prohibitions, in part, make it illegal for any person subjectto the jurisdiction of the United States to take, import or export, shipin interstate commerce in the course of commercial activity, or sell oroffer for sale in interstate or foreign commerce any listed species. Italso is illegal to possess, sell, deliver, carry, transport, or ship anysuch wildlife that has been taken illegally. Certain exceptions would applyto agents of the Service and State conservation agencies. Permits may be issued to carry out otherwise prohibited activities involvingendangered wildlife species under certain circumstances. Regulations governingpermits are at 50 CFR 17.22 and 17.23. Such permits are available for scientificpurposes to enhance the propagation or survival of the species and/or forincidental take in connection with otherwise lawful activities. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. A noticeoutlining the Service's reasons for this determination was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>on October 25, 1983 (48 FR 49244). <ITAG tagnum="74">References Cited</ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="25">Ahlstedt, S.A. 1986.
