<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0479 </DOCNO><TEXT>Many countries have announced that they have the plans to develop aerospaceplanes.In U.S.A. who is most anxious to develop aerospaceplanes, a first experimentalsatellite-orbit navigation plane which is called National Aerospaceplane(NASP) X-30 is to be completed in 1990's. Defense Advanced Research ProjectAgency (DARPA) and NASA bear their shares at a ratio of 80 : 20 in expenditurefor the development. The first navigation is to be conducted in 1993.At present, the body of X-30 is designed. For the design, the settingof orbit navigation velocity is most important since the X-30 navigatesin a satellite-orbit. For other key technologies to realize aerospaceplanes,development of air-breathing engines for use in hypersonic navigation,the shape and size of aerospaceplanes suitable for hypersonic navigation,development of new materials and a plane body structure which are durableto aerdynamic heat generated in hypersonic navigation.
