Robert Purcell, a hepatitis specialist at the NIH, told TheWashington Post the company's announcement ``is very important ifit holds up, and the data looks like it will.''   Both scientists were responding to the announcement Tuesday fromChiron Corp. of Emeryville, Calif. The biotechnology firm alsoannounced its scientists are developing a test for the virus thatcan be used at blood banks.   If the test proves successful, it could allow blood contaminatedwith the virus to be detected and thus prevent transmission of thedisease through blood transfusions.   The company said the finding eventually could lead to a vaccineto combat the disease.   Non-A, Non-B hepatitis is known as ``transfusion'' hepatitisbecause it causes about 95 percent of the hepatitis that isassociated with blood transfusions.   About 3 million people a year are infected with the disease, butit often goes undiagnosed, said McCurdy, because, unlike hepatitisA or B, it often does not cause jaundice.   He said up to 2 percent of those who develop chronic cases of``transfusion'' hepatitis develop serious, and often fatal, liverdamage.   McCurdy said he had not seen the Chiron findings published inany scientific journal and was not aware of the company'sdiscovery. He said most such discoveries are not considered validuntil they are confirmed in other labs, or examined by otherexperts prior to publication in a process called ``peer review.''   A Chiron announcement said the research results would bepublished ``in the near future.'' The company also said it had notyet filed application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administrationfor investigative research of its blood test kit, but plans to doso later this year.   ``I think they have got it this time,'' Purcell was quoted assaying. ``This is a first-rate group at a good company and theyhave been working on it for six years with very sophisticatedmolecular techniques.''   Chiron announced that the non-A, non-B virus was isolated byremoving all of the genetic material from a chimpanzee blood samplethat had a high level of the virus. The genetic material was theninserted into laboratory bacteria which, following instructionsfrom the transplanted genes, produced proteins.   Antibodies from the blood of hepatitis patients was then placedin the protein broth. These antibodies attached themselves to theproteins that originated from the non-A, non-B virus genes. Theresearchers then detected this attachment, indicating that thevirus had been isolated.</TEXT></DOC>
