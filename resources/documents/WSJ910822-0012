The latest step, which follows previously adoptedcost-cutting measures, means the Hartford, Conn., diversifiedmanufacturer will make some fundamental operating changes,including further reductions in staff and plant closings.&quot;The continuing domestic recession, the shrinking U.S.defense budget and increasingly aggressive competitionworld-wide necessitate exceptional actions,&quot; said Robert F.Daniell, chairman. For 1990, United Technologies reportedcosts of $20.5 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The announcement early yesterday prompted some analysts,who had generally been unhappy with management's recentperformance, to issue &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on the company'sstock. And in late trading on the New York Stock Exchange,United Technologies shares were quoted at $48, jumping$3.375.   &quot;Clearly the announcement is selling a bit of hope and Iam willing to buy this beauty formula, if you will,&quot; saidHoward Rubel, an analyst with C.J. Lawrence Inc., who changedhis recommendation to &quot;buy&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; soon after theannouncement. &quot;I think the company has made decisions tochange the way it operates, and there will be some strictperformance targets for the management throughout theorganization,&quot; he said. Steve Binder, an analyst at BearStearns andamp; Co., said, &quot;The company has found religion.&quot;   But Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. was less favorably impressed.Yesterday it put the company's double-A-minus senior debt,single-A-plus subordinated debt, and A-1-plus commercialpaper on Sandamp;P CreditWatch &quot;with negative implications.&quot; Therating agency said that while United Technologies's goal isto improve overall performance, the cost-cutting action &quot;mayrequire a material charge to earnings, which, combined withcurrently weak profitability, could diminish financialflexibility over the intermediate term.&quot;   Sandamp;P said it will meet with United Technologies managementlater this year &quot;to assess the financial implications of thecost-reduction program.&quot; Roman Szuper, an analyst at Sandamp;P,said the rating agency's action affects $2.5 billion ofUnited Technologies's $4 billion in debt outstanding.   Mr. Daniell, the United Technologies chairman, didn't givedetails of the cost-cutting program. He said in an interview,however, that the measure would involve taking &quot;a hard lookat the size and scope of our operations.&quot; He said the actionwould be broader and deeper than the previous efforts thatincluded deferral of pay raises and elimination of jobs atplant levels.   He said specific cost-cutting plans are currently beingdeveloped and will be completed by year end. UnitedTechnologies's main businesses serve defense, commercialairlines, buildings systems and automotive industries.   He said among the targets will be the company's defensebusiness, which has been adversely affected by thegovernment's cutbacks. Citing a bleak outlook for a recoveryin the commercial real estate industry, he said the companywill reassess the North American operations of its Otiselevator unit and Carrier Corp., which makes heating and airconditioning systems.   Mr. Daniell said the recovery he has been anticipating inthe automotive sector hasn't materialized either. &quot;I don'tsee a rapid volume pickup in North America in the foreseeablefuture,&quot; he said. The company already has trimmed operationsin this area and &quot;it's conceivable that there will be acouple of automotive plant closings,&quot; he said.   All of United Technologies' major businesses have reportedpoor results in recent quarters despite cost reductions thecompany has implemented since last year. In the first quarterof this year, the company's net dropped 70%, and fell 79% inthe second quarter. In 1990 the company earned $750.6million, or $5.91 a share, on revenue of $21.8 billion.   Mr. Daniell said the new cost-cutting plans call for jobreductions throughout the company, but he declined to saywhat the targets for the cuts would be.</TEXT></DOC>
