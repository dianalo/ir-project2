Amoco Corp. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. reported higherprofits, largely because of one-time items. Ashland Oil Inc.,a domestic refiner and marketer, also said profits surged.</LP><TEXT>   The results are expected to set an industrywide patternfor major oil companies. Those with extensive overseasrefining and marketing operations took advantage ofexceptional profit margins on gasoline, jet fuel and heatingoil in January and February, said Eugene Nowak, a securitiesanalyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in New York. &quot;Therewas a scramble for petroleum products,&quot; he said.   The increased demand from the war also caused dislocationsfor other products, all of which boosted margins. Inaddition, cold weather in Europe boosted demand. BesidesMobil, companies that benefited include Exxon Corp., TexacoInc. and Chevron Corp., analysts said; those companies areexpected to report earnings shortly. Profit margins sincehave fallen sharply.   Oil prices in the first quarter were little changed fromlast year so exploration and production profits were flat.Natural gas prices in the U.S. fell sharply because of theweak economy and warm weather, but they rose in Europebecause of cold weather.   Petrochemical operations continued to slump. The weakeconomy and excess supply of some chemicals have erodedprices and profit margins.                                                                                                          Mobil                                                                                                          Net income rose to $710 million, or $1.73 a share, from$400 million, or 94 cents a share. Last year's quarterincluded a $28 million charge. Revenue rose 10% to $16.58billion from $15.03 billion.   Mobil, Fairfax, Va., said refining and marketing earningssoared to $442 million from $92 million. Of those,international results jumped more than sixfold to $342million, while U.S. refining profit more than doubled.   Exploration and production results were flat at $371million, as were oil prices. Mobil said the price it receivedfor the oil it sold was about $1.12 a barrel lower in theU.S. and $1.25 a barrel higher overseas. A 17% decline inU.S. natural gas prices reduced profits, but Mobil said thatwas more than offset by a 19% increase in international gasprices as well as increased sales from Indonesia andelsewhere.   Mobil's stock fell 62.5 cents to $67.75 in New York StockExchange composite trading yesterday.                                                                                                          Amoco                                                                                                          Net income rose 72% to $803 million, or $1.60 a share,from $466 million, or 91 cents a share, because of a changein certain accounting practices pertaining to reserves fortaxes. Without it, operating profit rose 5.6% to $492million, or 98 cents a share. Revenue rose 3.2% to $7.3billion from $7.07 billion.   Amoco, based in Chicago, said refining and marketingprofit jumped to $214 million from $129 million because ofhigher margins in the U.S. Amoco doesn't have foreignrefining operations.   The company said lower natural gas prices reducedexploration and production profit, which fell to $313 millionfrom $352 million. Higher exploration expenses in the U.S.and overseas also curbed results. Chemical profit was flat at$83 million.   Amoco shares ended at $53.75, up 25 cents, on the BigBoard.                                                                                                          Occidental Petroleum                                                                                                          Net income rose 26% to $136 million, or 45 cents a share,from $108 million, or 37 cents a share. But the 1991 quarterincludes a gain of $53 million, or 18 cents a share, from atax benefit, and the 1990 quarter includes a loss of $2million, or one cent a share, from debt retirement. Withoutthe gain and loss, operating profit declined 25% to $83million. Sales rose to $5.3 billion from $5.2 billion.   Occidental's chemical segment operating profit was itslargest, at $139 million. But that's a decline from $186million. Occidental, Los Angeles, said exploration andproduction earnings rose to $122 million from $100 millionbecause of higher world-wide crude prices and production andincreased international gas volumes. Lower U.S. gas priceshurt, however.   The company's stock ended at $19.25, up 25 cents, on theBig Board.                                                                                                          Ashland                                                                                                          Net income surged to $27 million, or 48 cents a share,from $1 million, or two cents a share, for Ashland's fiscalsecond quarter ended March 31. Sales fell 2.7% to $2.05billion from $2.11 billion.   The Ashland, Ky., refiner and marketer said refinerymargins were wide because of unusually low U.S. gasolineinventories. The company's refining operations postedoperating profit of $45 million, a record for the secondquarter. That was partially offset by weakness in retailmarketing, where competition was fierce.   Ashland shares closed at $34.50, up $1.625, on the BigBoard.</TEXT></DOC>
