BishopStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PHARMACEUTICALS, HOSPITAL SUPPLIES, MANAGEMENT (PHA) </IN><TEXT>   Many Americans getting their blood tested may be in for a surprise: Doctors may order them on low-fat diets or even drugs, to fight cholesterol levels previously classed as normal.    This, at least, is the hoped-for result of a new national strategy to cut the rate of heart attacks by lowering levels of cholesterol in the blood. High levels of the crystalline fatty alcohol lead to fatty deposits that clog coronary arteries; those deposits, in turn, lead to heart attacks.    Health authorities, for the first time, are setting criteria for &quot;desirable&quot; cholesterol levels in individuals -- and those levels are sharply lower than what heretofore has been considered &quot;normal.&quot;    &quot;There are going to be a lot of people -- perhaps one in four adults, which would be tens of millions of people -- who will find out they have got a problem with cholesterol,&quot; says James Cleeman, the director of the National Cholesterol Education Program, the six-month-old federally coordinated effort of government and private agencies to carry out the new strategy.    The criteria will apply to children as well as adults, women as well as men. There are variations according to age and other factors. But for most adults who follow the new program's dictum that everyone should know his or her cholesterol level, this is probably what will happen:    --If a blood test reveals a cholesterol level higher than 200 milligrams per deciliter of blood serum, the doctor will ask for a second blood test to confirm the first.    --If the tests confirm that the level is above 200 but less than 240 or 250, the doctor will probably urge the patient to go on a low-fat diet, one in which eggs, butter, prime roasts and steaks and other animal fats are replaced by vegetable oils, fish and lean meats.    --If the level is above 240, the doctor will ask the testing laboratory to provide a detailed breakdown of the types of cholesterol and fats, called triglycerides, circulating in the bloodstream. A strict low-fat diet will be urged for these patients. But, depending on the test results, the doctor may also prescribe one of a growing number of drugs.    The new attack on cholesterol is aimed at lowering the toll of heart disease, which this year is expected to kill 540,000 Americans. &quot;One projection says that we can reduce this by 100,000 deaths a year if we can lower the average cholesterol level by 10%,&quot; says Robert Levy, a researcher and co-director of a 1984 study that found lowering cholesterol levels could reduce the risk of heart attacks.    The program, if successful, could also speed up the food industry's introduction of low-fat, low-cholesterol foods, adds Dr. Levy, now the senior associate vice president for health sciences at Columbia University in New York. While egg producers face a drop in demand for whole eggs, &quot;the dairy industry has shown it has the capacity to make more low-fat products . . ., and the cattle and pork producers already are pushing leaner cuts of meat,&quot; he notes.    Drug makers, meanwhile, realize that the potential market for anti-cholesterol drugs is as great as -- if not greater than -- the estimated $5 billion-a-year world-wide market for high-blood-pressure drugs. Thus, a major research effort is under way to develop more effective drugs.    Until recently, cholesterol levels of 250 or even 300 were often shrugged off. A 1983 federal survey found that 40% of doctors didn't prescribe low-fat diets to patients unless their levels broached the 300 mark, and didn't prescribe drugs until the 340 level was reached. But the publication of new research data in the last three years has changed many doctors' minds. A new survey finds that only one in 10 doctors waits until cholesterol reaches 300 to prescribe diet; 23% wait until it hits the 340 mark to prescribe drugs.    Prompting the new strategy is what medical researchers consider the final proof, ending 25 years of controversy, that lowering blood cholesterol levels reduces the risk of heart attacks.    This proof came in early 1984, when researchers announced the results of an eight-year trial involving 3,800 middle-aged men who had excessive levels of cholesterol. Those volunteers who cut their levels the most, using a low-fat diet and a drug, had a dramatic reduction in both fatal and nonfatal heart attacks compared with those whose levels were trimmed only slightly or not at all. A 25% cut in cholesterol levels, for instance, was linked to a 50% reduction in heart attacks.    In the succeeding two years, scientists have been trying to determine exactly how low cholesterol levels should be to minimize the risk of a heart attack. In the Orient, where heart attacks are rare, average levels are below 150. In the U.S., where heart attacks are the leading cause of death, the average level among middle-aged men, the most studied population group, is 215 to 220. (In the 1960s, when the rate of heart attacks was at its peak, the average was about 235.)    Statisticians have determined that the risk of a heart attack begins to rise when cholesterol levels exceed 150; when the levels top 200 the risk climbs sharply. Between 50% and 60% of American men have levels in what epidemiologists call this &quot;zone of accelerated risk&quot; above 200.    A smaller proportion of women are in this risk zone largely because before menopause women tend to have a much lower risk of heart attacks, protected presumably by female sex hormones. But after menopause, between ages 40 and 50, women's risk of heart attacks begins to rise sharply; it equals that of men by age 60.    But setting up separate criteria by age and sex might prove too complicated for a public education program, health officials fear. So the concept that anyone with a level over 200 should seek the advice of a doctor is being pushed.    Criteria to guide doctors in deciding which patients should be treated and how vigorously probably won't be issued until later this year. The guidelines for doctors probably will follow criteria adopted in late 1984 by a federally sponsored &quot;consensus conference&quot; of heart experts and endorsed last spring by the American Heart Association, a nonprofit group that raises research funds. These are expected to be more detailed, particularly in regard to age. Cholesterol levels tend to be lower at younger ages; a level deemed average for a 50-year-old man might be alarmingly high in a 20-year-old.    Under these proposed criteria, doctors and testing laboratories would abandon the concept of &quot;normal&quot; cholesterol levels, substituting risk categories for different age groups. &quot;Average risk&quot; would be cholesterol levels found in about 75% of population with the lowest cholesterol levels while &quot;high risk&quot; would be the levels found in the 5% of population with the highest cholesterol. &quot;Moderate risk&quot; would be those in between.    Doctors will probably be unable to get some patients, particularly those in the high-risk category, to reach the ideal risk level of below 200. So the doctors will be urged to at least try to get a patient's cholesterol down to the next-lower category by diet or drugs, or both.    As for children, the new criteria are more nebulous, partly because not enough is known about what constitutes an ideal level in a child. About 5% of American children have levels above 200, compared with the 150 that many scientists think is ideal. Some scientists suggest that all children should have a cholesterol check.    As a result, the new criteria call for checking levels only in children whose parents or other family members have had heart attacks or strokes. If the level is around 200 or higher it should then be analyzed to see if the children have inherited a genetic defect that causes an abnormal cholesterol makeup and predisposes them to an early heart attack in adulthood.    ---   Who is the Most at Risk?    Suggested risk categories by age group, and percentages of people falling into those categories, over time:                                      AGE RISK               20-29          30-39           40+ Average       Below 200 mg.   Below 220 mg.   Below 240 mg. Moderate      200-220 mg.     220-240 mg.     240-260 mg. High          Above 220 mg.   Above 240 mg.   Above 260 mg.   NOTE: Serum Cholesterol levels are in milligrams perdeciliter. Surveys were conducted by National Center forHealth Statistics.</TEXT></DOC>
