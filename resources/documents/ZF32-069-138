 The whole state of Montana has fewer peole than myneighborhood in Los Angeles, so you can imagin the size of Missoula.andP;  Let mebe hones: I was expecting to be stuck in a wilderness, fighting withsex-starved moose while hungry wolves ate the driver of the four-wheel drivehotel courtesy vehicle.andM;Things were much better than I thought they'd be.andP;  The meeting was held at aRed Lion Inn, so the food and service were great.andP;  The University of Montanais located in Missoula, so it's a college tow with a different flavor: oldlocal stores, bars, and places that appeal to the college crowd.andM;The ANSI X3H2 Committee is down to 35 members, which makes the meetingsshorter and more productive.andP;  The most interesting part of this meeting,however, occurred outside the committee.andM;The Organization for International Standards (ISO) is working on a proposalfor encoding all of the alphabets of all languages in 32 bits, which both SQLcommittees have seen and favor.andP;  Meanwhile, a consortium including DEC, IBM,Apple, Lotus, and Microsoft is proposing a 16-bit character-code systemcalled Unicode for the same purpose.andM;Computerworld recently reported that six major computer companys haveendorsed the use of RSA Data Security Inc.'s public-key system.andP;  The groupincludes DEC, Lotus, Novell, Sun, Apple, and Microsoft.andP;  The RSA system usestwo keys--one public and one private--to decrypt messages.andP;  The public key isavailable to everyone and can tell you who sent the message, but not what itsays.andP;  (You need both keys to read it.)andP;  X3H2 has never tried to set astandard encryption method in SQL, but many vendors offer an encryptionoption.andM;The politics of encryption standards are strange.andP;  NIST has failed to set astandard for public-key encryption systems, although it attempted to inSeptember 1990.andP;  One rumor is that the National Security Agency can alreadybreak the current data-encryption standard algorithm, but fears that RSAwould be too hard to break, and is consequently blocking RSA's efforts.andM;ISO wants ANSI to move faster on SQL3.andP;  Considering that SQL2 isn't finishedand ISO doesn't have embedded SQL yet, this demand is slightly rediculous.andO;The current ANSI and ISO SQL3 work has been flavored by object-orientedapproaches, but neither group has had any input from any of theobject-oriented gurus, who prefer to sit on the sidelines and snipe at us.andM;Textbases, a real sleeper issue, also came up.andP;  ISO got a presentation of thefull-text SQL (SFQL) textbase project from Aerospatiale (the French aircraftmanufacturer) at the ISO meeting in France.andP;  For those who have forgotten,this project attempts to standardize the query language for CD-ROM manuals inthe U.S.andP;  aircraft industry.andM;Several months ago, the Aircraft Transportation Association presented SFQL tothe committee.andP;  The language looks like mutant SQL, but they have nothing incommon.andP;  Neither ANSI or ISO was impressed.andP;  Nobody seems to realize that theNational Information Standards Organization has a project for this type ofquery language, and DIN in Germany is also working on one.andM;At the same time, Kohji Shibano of the Japanese ISO group presented a paperon the document query language (DQL) project, which has been designed tosupport a database of standard general markup language (SGML) documents.andP;  Thelanguage is strongly SQL-based, but it models a document as a tree structureof chapters, paragraphs, and sentences.andP;  The project sponsors are Hitachi,the National Center for Science Information Systems, and a Japaneseuniversity.andP;  The sponsors want to develop the language as a Japanese nationalstandard.andP;  DQL is the basis for a working prototype and is expected to beavailable by the end of the year.andM;I was the only committee member to vote nay on the SQL Ada Module DescriptionLanguage (SAMeDL) letter ballot.andP;  This project from the Software EngineeringInstitute at Carnegie-Melon University attempts to make SQL-89 conform to Adastyle by changing SQL syntax to Ada-style syntax and then using apreprocessor of some sort.andP;  Basically, it adds END keywords to SQLstatements, allows Ada datatypes for domains, and has complete modules forembedded SQL code.andM;Everyone agreed that SAMeDL is a technical mess.andP;  Ada datatypes may be aproblem since Ada binds at compile time and dynamic SQL binds at runtime.andO;The Ada standard is currently in review and decimal arithmetic is an issue.andO;The proposal doesn't use the SQLCODE mechanism to handle errors, and wants touse the Ada EXCEPTION mechanism instead.andP;  In addition, the document doesn'taddress the terrible problems with correlation names in SQL statements.andM;As it stands, the project is unworkable, but none of the vendors wanted totell the U.S.andP;  Department of Defense.andP;  So the vendors voted yes, and sent acarefully worded letter out from X3H2.andP;  In the meantime, the rumor is thatDoD is going to push SQL/Ada in Europe, forcing it on ANSI via ISO, and willthen make it a military standard.andP;  Ada is much more popular in Europe than inthe United States, so this approach stands a better chance than trying to gothrough U.S.andP;  vendors.andM;The National Institute for Science and Technology (NIST) now has a FIPS-127conformance test suite for Ada that uses the ANSI embedded format, which is afurther point against the SAM-eDL project.andP;  And while we're talking about theFIPS-127 tests, as of June, Digital Equipment Corp. is the first and onlyvendor to pass all parts of the test suite with perfect scores.andM;The ANSI X3H2.1 Remote Database Access subcommittee finally has a full staffof officers.andP;  The committee hopes to start looking at papers and working assoon as possible.andP;  However, the SQL/Access group will be demonstrating aworking model of a multiple product database server at the Plaza Hotel in NewYork City by July.andP;  This action will put the industry ahead of the standardsefforts in this area.andM;Transaction control is a separate topic in itself and probably shouldn't bepart of SQL or any database standard.andP;  Unfortunately, it is -and we're stuckwith it.andP;  Gary Puckering of Cognos Inc. sent a reply to the letter ballotthat outlined changes for the current transaction security levels.andP;  Thecommittee felt his paper was interestng, but worried about some technicaldetails.andM;Broadly speaking, two classes of concurrency-control schemes exist:optimistic and pessimistic.andP;  A pessimistic model assumes that users willalways be in conflict for the same data when they try to commit work to thedatabase.andP;  Therefore, you must use a lock on tables and other resources tomake sure everything is serializable.andP;  The lock keeps everyone else out whileone user accesses the data.andM;An optimistic model assumes that users seldom compete for the same data whenthey update the database.andP;  Therefore, you don't lock resources, but ratherhandle the update collisions as exceptions when they occur.andP;  One of thesemethods is a generation-based scheme.andP;  All users get a copy of the parts ofthe database they need to do their work, keeping generational copies of thiswork as they go along.andP;  when finished, they try to commit updates to themaster copy.andP;  If no conflicts exist, users overwrite the master at the sametime; if conflicts do exist, the system can tell the users to try again orcan rollback each user to a generation copy where no conflicts exist.andM;Optimistic concurrency models perform better than pessimistic ones in thereal world, but they require more resources to gain the extra speed.andP;  Again,we face the speed for space trade-off in computer systems.andP;  The ANSItransaction model is currently based on a pessimistic model, whereas theCognos proposal would also model optimistic concurrency systems.andP;  For moreinformation about this topic, you should read Database Concurrency Control byChristos Papalimitriou (Computer Science Press, 1986).andM;We ran into another problem with the lack of transaction standards above theSQL environment.andP;  SQL can be embedded in a host program that can access SQLdatabases, ISAM file systems, and other data resources at the same time.andO;What happens to the SQL transaction in progress when another data-resourcehandler closes down the program?andP;  We decided that SQL sessions must be shutdown by SQL commands, which is outside the scope of SQL.andM;Germany has taken a strong stand against extensions and reorganizations ofSQL2 as ANSI attempts to bring the document to a final form for publicreview, but it's often difficult to tell a correction from an extension.andP;  InSQL-89, grouped views were not allowed.andP;  Many current implementations nowhave this feature, but grouped views aren't part of the current standard.andP;  Atthis meeting, we moved grouped views from full to intermediate SQL2.andP;  Is thisan extension or a minor fix for implementors who are already using it?andM;I ran into this problem trying to do a join with a grouped view in XDB by XDBSystems Inc. (based in Laurel, Maryland).andP;  I was caught by surprise because Iexpected to find the common grouped-view extension; however, XDB conforms tothe standard.andP;  I don't feel guilty about my ignorance, however, because theNIST test suite also has a program with a grouped view in it.andP;  The betaversion was sent to nine SQL vendors and only one noticed the problem.andM;Procedural extensions to (or 4GL products that use) SQL is another area whereyou can find products without standards.andP;  This topic has come up in thecommittee before, but has never gotten very far.andP;  For the first time, weconsidered a proposal for procedural extensions, but the extensions were inan SQL3 timeframe and were very rough.andP;  You should plan to stick with yourvendor 4GL products for at least another decade.andM;The rest of the work was mostly dull clean-up stuff, administrative work, andhandling items from our known-problems list.andP;  It was as dull as itsounds--maybe worse--which is why I always check for brew pubs in my backissues of Beer magazine before I leave town for the meetings.andM;Joe Celko is a database-design consultant and teacher in Los Angeles.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
