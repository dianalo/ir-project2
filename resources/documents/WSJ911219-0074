The choir isassembled on stage, and stately music by George FrederickHandel fills the sanctuary.   But as soon as the congregation has been seated, theprelude stops and there is a new sound -- unmistakablypost-Elvis.</LP><TEXT>   The Praise Boys, a band of five born-again Christians whooften back the choir, quickly have heads nodding and toestapping to the light-rock lyric &quot;Jesus, We Remember It's YourBirthday]&quot; They do some old favorites, too, like &quot;Joy to theWorld,&quot; but with a decidedly new beat.   Rex Thomas strums a bright yellow electric guitar. He hasplayed with Al Hirt and Ella Fitzgerald. Tom Adams is at thesynthesizer. He has backed up Bette Midler. A saxophonist, abass guitar player and a drummer round out the ensemble.   But if this is Christmas, shouldn't there be a big pipeorgan pounding out the great old hymns for the inspiration ofthe oldest Protestant congregation in the San FernandoValley?   &quot;That's passe,&quot; declares the Rev. Jess C. Moody. Youngermembers of his flock, he adds, &quot;don't dig Bach.&quot; And thatgoes for Beethoven and Buxtehude, too.   The pipe organ is nearly as old as Western civilization,but there is less and less for it to do in the modernsuburban sanctuary, given the deep decline in membership ofdenominations that were bastions of organ music --Presbyterians and Episcopalians, particularly. At the sametime, more and more churches are playing down classicalreligious music in favor of a &quot;Christian top-40 sound.&quot;   About a thousand Lutheran churches have taken upcontemporary songs and instruments in the past three years,says David Anderson, president of Fellowship Ministries, anonprofit group in Phoenix that arranges concerts andpublishes music for churches. &quot;It's all from the grassroots,&quot; he says. It's not coming from the seminaries.&quot;   But it doesn't always come easy. Traditionalists,organists prominent among them, aren't amused by the trendtoward what one church musician calls &quot;schlocky little Jesussongs.&quot;   James Moeser, president of the American Guild ofOrganists, blames television evangelists for popularizingpop-style church music. (Jimmy Swaggart had a lot of upbeatcountry gospel music on his show.) &quot;It's a perfect match ofvery superficial theology with superficial music,&quot; he says.   Proponents of sacred pop argue that history is on theirside, that hymns revered by purists today were the secularditties of yesteryear. Martin Luther borrowed music from aGerman love song for &quot;O, Sacred Head Now Wounded.&quot; Likewise,John and Charles Wesley launched the Methodist movement withhymns written to the melodies of English pub songs.   The Community Church of Joy in Glendale, Ariz., has grownfrom fewer than 100 people on a Sunday to more than 2,500 inthe decade since it hired a new pastor who brought incontemporary music. It may be a case of cause and effect. Thechurch -- which has the largest Lutheran congregation in thestate -- still has an organ, but it is only used forweddings, says the Rev. Timothy K. Wright, a 33-year-oldassistant pastor.   Nowadays, those arriving for the 11:15 a.m. serviceencounter a band doing sound checks, a scene deliberatelyreminiscent of a rock concert. &quot;We're targeting babyboomerswho were raised on rock 'n' roll and who have rebelledagainst classical music,&quot; Mr. Wright says.   Shepherd of the Hills started down this rocky road a fewyears back and has come so far that on Sunday next, it plansto mix traditional Christmas music with such 20th-centurytrifles as &quot;Jingle Bell Rock.&quot;   At first blush, Dr. Moody, the church's 66-year-oldpastor, doesn't seem the type to have initiated such change.He dresses in dark business suits and thinks of himself as atheological conservative in a denomination similarlyinclined.   But get the man talking about music and he soundsdownright radical.   &quot;I think there is a revolution coming in the field of{religious} music,&quot; Dr. Moody says. Churches that &quot;don't geton board&quot; will be &quot;vacated so fast.&quot;   Ever since its musical transformation, Shepherd of theHills has watched its congregation grow younger. The averageage of its members has fallen from 36 (a bit long in thetooth, in the view of church consultants) to 27.   The church took its boldest step two months ago when itmoved into a modern, barn-like sanctuary in the growingChatsworth area after selling its old building in nearby VanNuys.   The interior of the old church was dominated by a $1.5million pipe organ. But when the new building was designed,says music director Phil Barfoot, &quot;there was a real consciousdecision to do away with the pipe organ.&quot; The old one wassold, for 10 cents on the dollar, to a Catholic parish.   The change has its partisans. Dave Hollingsworth, a lanky,long-haired 30-year-old, says a steady diet of nothing buttraditional organ music &quot;just gets really stale.&quot; Havinginstruments like a synthesizer and horns in church &quot;opens youup to a lot more sounds,&quot; he says.   Troy Schmidt, 30, a program developer with the DisneyChannel, says too many churches think solemn music isreverent. &quot;I think, if it's quiet, it's boring.&quot; CharlesBradford, 77, a retired Lockheed Corp. quality-controlmanager, says of the Praise Boys: &quot;I like the beat.&quot;   But others in the congregation complain that the music istoo loud and distracting and that people talk through some ofthe Praise Boys' opening numbers. James Haggai, a retiredsmall-business man, speaks passionately about not hearingenough of the traditional music he says is vital to anychurchgoer's religious education. &quot;You're throwing away thefoundation,&quot; he declares. &quot;Those hymns are so supplementaryto the Bible. They bring honor and glory to Jesus Christ.&quot;   Shepherd of the Hills decided to do without hymnals, too,in its new house of worship and now projects written verseson big screens at either side of the stage. As a result, Mr.Barfoot points out, the congregation looks up -- heavenward,one supposes -- while singing. These days, the assembledmainly sing what are called &quot;praise choruses,&quot; new tunesinstantly familiar and accessible.   Lyrics tend to be simple and repetitive, says DennisAllen, a Nashville, Tenn., composer who is working on asongbook of 60 such tunes. He offers as an example: &quot;Lord,you are worthy, worthy to be honored, worthy to be praised .. .&quot;   Thus, a praise chorus is a snap to learn and easy toremember. &quot;You get it in your mind and it stays there,&quot; saysLana Johnson, who sings in the choir at Shepherd of theHills. During the week, &quot;I'll be humming it at the Xeroxmachine.&quot;   Mr. Barfoot says he knows full well that there are someunhappy sheep in the flock. Heeding requests from oldermembers, the ones closer to 36 than 27, he has been bringingback some of the old music. &quot;We are trying to be sensitive tothose who want the hymns.&quot;   And, after some debate, church officials decided to buy acompact, unobtrusive electronic organ for the new sanctuary.It finds good use in playing solemn background to spokenprayers. Mr. Haggai, for one, is grateful that it is there.</TEXT></DOC>
