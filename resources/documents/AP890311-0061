He is the second Cabinet minister to quit since a commissionbegan investigating sales of locally assembled vehicles to seniorgovernment officials who allegedly sold them at illegally inflatedprices.   Nkala told a three-member commission Friday that he handed hisresignation to acting President Simon Muzenda the previous day.   To thunderous applause from the packed High Court room, Nkalasaid he did this ``when it became clear to me what was going tohappen here, and to show you the gravity with which I treat thematter.''   Earlier, Nkala had testified to the commission that his wife,Thandiwe, had sold a Toyota Cressida on his behalf for the statutoryprice of $14,500. But the buyer and Mrs. Nkala on Thursday testifiedthe car actually was sold illegally for $45,000.   Nkala told Judge President Wilson Sandura he also has tenderedhis resignation from all posts in the governing Zimbabwe AfricanNational Union. As treasurer, Nkala was fourth in the partyhierarchy.   The minister told the judge that Muzenda had not accepted hisresignations immediately, but was holding them for President RobertMugabe's return from a visit to Europe.   Frederick Shava, the minister of state for political affairs,resigned Tuesday after admitting he lied to the commission.   He was the first casualty of the commission instigated by Mugabeto investigate irregular sales of cars by a local assembly plant topoliticians, military chiefs, civil servants and business executives.   He also is the first government minister to resign under a cloudsince Mugabe led the white-ruled British colony of Rhodesia toindependence as black-governed Zimbabwe nine years ago.   The ministers' departure strengthens many critics' charges thathigh-level corruption is widespread.   Shava and Nkala were among six ministers to testify before thecommission about buying cars and trucks from Willowvale MotorIndustries Pvt. Ltd. and then allegedly selling them for fat profitsabove fixed retail prices.   Zimbabwe has a brisk black market in vehicles which are in shortsupply because of foreign currency shortages.   The other ministers denied any wrongdoing.</TEXT></DOC>
