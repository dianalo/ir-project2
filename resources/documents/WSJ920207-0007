Unlike his friend, French President Francois Mitterrand,Mr. Kohl isn't drifting rudderlessly through the end of histerm. Unlike George Bush and British Prime Minister JohnMajor, Mr. Kohl doesn't face a potentially tough re-electionfight this year. Unlike Japanese Prime Minister KiichiMiyazawa, Mr. Kohl's subordinates aren't embroiled infinancial scandals.</LP><TEXT>   But the issue of Germany's leadership in the world hasbeen controversial since Bismarck created the country in1871, and especially so in the past 50 years. Germanchancellors, and especially the architect of modern Germanunification, must live with this problem like a migraine thateven after half a century shows few signs of abating.   Nonetheless, Mr. Kohl, a genial bear of a man who chucklesfrequently during a 90-minute interview in his Bonn officewith The Wall Street Journal Europe and the German financialdaily Handelsblatt, is keenly aware that Germany mustshoulder more international responsibility and be sensitiveto the fears and concerns this may produce. He isphilosophical, saying he understands why such fears occur butthat there is nothing Germany can really do about them.   &quot;It's like the weather,&quot; he says. &quot;It's something that youcan't influence. When it rains, you put up your umbrella;when the sun is out, you take off your jacket.&quot;   Despite these concerns, he says he will fight for anamendment to the German Constitution to allow German troopsto participate in United Nations peacekeeping efforts,including any future undertakings like last year's PersianGulf War. &quot;We have the obligation to assume moreresponsibility on an international scale,&quot; he says.   Mr. Kohl shrugs off suggestions that Germany seek apermanent seat on the U.N. Security Council. While Germanymust and will do more, he says, true world leadership remainswith the &quot;strongest country in the world,&quot; the U.S.   Meanwhile, German and European unity go hand in hand, Mr.Kohl insists, and despite recent strains, the French-Germancouple will continue to drive European affairs. (Mr. Kohl'soffice walls bear lithographs of former German ChancellorKonrad Adenauer and of French President Mitterrand.)   On economic topics, he says Germany will use itschairmanship of the Group of Seven leading industrialcountries to push for conclusion this year of a world tradeagreement, which he calls a &quot;precondition&quot; for continuedprosperity. He realizes that world financial markets haveGerman interest rates and wage settlements under themicroscope and pledges to lead the fight against inflationabove all else.   &quot;The biggest task in the current wage bargaining round isto be reasonable,&quot; he says. &quot;I myself intend to steer areasonable course as far as federal civil servants andemployees are concerned.&quot; A recent pay agreement raising mostGerman steel workers' wages 6.4%, along with rises in Germaninterest rates to high levels, have many Europeans worriedabout the economic outlook. But Mr. Kohl insists that he willkeep inflation down because that is the &quot;best investmentpolicy and the best social policy.&quot;   Amid growing fears of chaos to the east of Germany, thechancellor says he is optimistic that Russia and the otherrepublics of the former Soviet Union can &quot;make it&quot; and becomefree-market democracies. This will require the help of allthe West, not just Germany, he stresses. The solution, hesuggests, is to help these new countries to help themselvesby replacing the teachings of one German, Karl Marx, withthose of another, Ludwig Erhard, the architect of WestGermany's postwar &quot;economic miracle.&quot; But he wants to linkaid to these countries to their strict adherence todisarmament agreements.   For Mr. Kohl, more perhaps than for any other worldstatesman, the collapse of the Soviet bloc has broughteuphoria as well as tricky problems. &quot;For Germany, thesituation has changed profoundly,&quot; he says. &quot;German unityhasn't made our position in the world easier. On thecontrary, it has made it more complex.   &quot;What we Germans have to understand is that we have ourproblems with German unity, but that our partners and friendshave their problems with it too. I'm totally againstcriticizing them for showing this kind of uneasiness.&quot;   For Mr. Kohl, continuing to integrate Germany into aEuropean political and economic union is &quot;the only genuineremedy&quot; to this problem. &quot;This is why European unification isjust as important for the Germans as German unification.&quot;   Still, Germany, as Western Europe's most populous andeconomically strongest country, does have responsibilities.&quot;There is a danger of us becoming too parochial in ourapproach,&quot; the chancellor acknowledges. &quot;We are, after all,part of the United Nations. When you're a member of such anorganization, you cannot accept just the advantages but notthe obligations -- which is why we have to clarify ourconstitution {to allow German troops to fight outside theterritory of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization}, and Iwill fight for that. If necessary I will make it an issue inthe next election in 1994.&quot;   Developments in the European Community also mean Germanymust shoulder its burdens, Mr. Kohl says. &quot;We're on the eveof political union in Europe, and Germany after all is partof this,&quot; he says. &quot;It's absurd to believe that we can bepart of this political union and not participate fully inoperations launched by the U.N. We have to be a member of theU.N. with all rights and duties.&quot;   As chairman of this July's economic summit of the Group ofSeven industrial nations in Munich, Mr. Kohl says he willfight to unblock the stalled world trade talks under theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. &quot;We must make everyeffort to ensure that before the Munich summit, GATT has beenbrought to a successful conclusion,&quot; he says. &quot;As a matter ofprinciple, free world trade is the decisive precondition forworld-wide prosperity.&quot;   He adds, &quot;Protection would be deadly in the long run. Youhave to open your window for your economy, as in your house,in order to be healthy. I will never accept a fortressEurope. Everyone has to compromise to make the GATT round asuccess.&quot;   On aid to the former Soviet bloc, Mr. Kohl speaks as aleader who has already pledged or sent -- by his reckoning --105 billion marks ($66 billion) to Eastern Europe and toRussia and other former Soviet republics. &quot;Of course we haveto give financial help,&quot; he says. &quot;But I must say Germany hashit the outer limit of what she can actually give. Now wethink it's the others' turn, both in Europe and also incountries that are very far away from Europe. The Japanese,too, draw a great benefit from the changes in EasternEurope.&quot;   But huge problems remain, he says, especially indismantling the huge arsenals these countries had built up.While much attention has been paid to nuclear weapons -- notto mention unsafe nuclear reactors -- Mr. Kohl says, &quot;Iconsider the chemical weapons to be the most destabilizing ofall, because they're so easily transportable and so easy tolaunch.&quot;   To attack these problems, Mr. Kohl says he wants to&quot;establish a linkage between help and assistance that we giveto the new republics and their records as regards abiding bythe disarmament agreements, so that we really come to astrict control.&quot;   Within the rapidly changing global fabric, Mr. Kohl sees aconstant beacon: the U.S. As if to emphasize Bonn's interestin warmer relations between the two countries, Mr. Kohl waxeseloquent on the U.S.'s continuing leadership role. &quot;Only afool would say America is on the decline,&quot; he says. &quot;The U.S.is the strongest country in the world. Period. The U.S. hasproblems, some of them homemade. But one always relies, timeand again, on the U.S. Every time, when responsibility has tobe assumed, one calls for the Americans.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
