The IRA claimed responsibility.   Lawmakers from Northern Ireland said the slayings suggested aserious breach of security involving the regular consultationsbetween the two police forces, set up under the Anglo-Irish Accordto coordinate action against terrorism.   Irish Prime Minister Charles Haughey condemned the murders andpledged full cooperation in the investigation.   The South Armagh Brigade of the Irish Republican Army sent amessage to news media claiming responsibility and saying themovements of the victims had been monitored.   The deaths followed a series of retaliatory slayings byProtestant and Roman Catholic extremists. On Sunday, gunmen stormeda Belfast home and killed a Roman Catholic man while he said hisprayers with his wife.   A police spokesman said the names of the two dead officers werenot released, and said he had no firm information on how they werekilled. ``We assume they were shot,'' he said on condition ofanonymity.   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, identified thevictims as Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and Superintendent BobBuchanan. Breen, the police commander in the South Armagh area, wassaid to be the highest-ranking police officer killed in 20 years ofsectarian violence in the province.   ``They were in an unmarked car, without uniforms, so theiridentity had to be through information supplied to the terrorists,''said the Rev. William McCrea, a Democratic Unionist member ofParliament.   The constabulary said the car was found near Jonesborough, justinside the British province of Northern Ireland. The area was sealedoff and the area was searched by helicopter before police and troopsmoved in.   Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King pledged that the securityforces would take ``every possible step'' to combat the wave ofretaliatory murders.   King, the British Cabinet minister responsible for NorthernIreland, discussed the violence Monday with deputy police chiefMichael McAtamney of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.   ``What the RUC and all the security forces need at this time isthe full support of the whole community in a total rejection ofviolence and a maximum public alertness and vigilance against theseevil groups,'' he said afterwards.   David Braniff, 63 and a father of 13, was shot dead in his northBelfast home Sunday night. Neighbors said two gunmen burst intoBraniff's house and shot him at point-blank range. They said he diedwith his rosary in his hands.   Police appealed to the public to help find Braniff's killers. Nogroup immediately claimed responsibility.   Braniff, a Catholic, was a bricklayer who had been a Protestantbefore he married. He had British flags tattooed on his arms andworked in Protestant areas of Belfast.   On Friday, Catholic civil servant Niall Davies, 42, was shot inhis home, apparently in retaliation for the IRA killing the previousnight of Jackie Irvine, 49, a former commander of the Protestantparamilitary Ulster Volunteer Force.   The latest round of killings began Feb. 12 when Catholic attorneyPatrick Finucane was shot in his home. The Protestant undergroundUlster Freedom Fighters said they killed him because he was an IRAofficer. His widow denied it.   The mainly Catholic IRA is fighting to end British rule inNorthern Ireland and unite the province with the Catholic IrishRepublic to the south, while the Protestant majority wants to remainunder the British flag.</TEXT></DOC>
