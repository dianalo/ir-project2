<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-49-0156 </DOCNO><TEXT>For the first time, a Federal German court has decided to shut down anuclear power station (Muelheim-Kaerlich) that has been operating sincethen on the basis of valid operating licenses issued by the competentlicensing authority (OVG Koblenz, Higher administrative court, decision7 B II 2/86 of October 10, 1986). The article discusses the legal problemscreated by this decision, as e.g.: The factual scope of validity of alicence granted under section 7 Atomic Energy Act; the protection ofconfidence of the applicant for a licence in connection with the self-engagementof the licensing authority; consideration of the non-licensed coolingtower in the preliminary proceedings for guaranteeing legal protection.The author backs the decision of the OVG Koblenz, as a nuclear powerstation may not start operation without a licence issued under air pollutioncontrol laws, which in this case had not yet been obtained.
