Thougha little longer etching time was required, the contrast of autoradiographicimage on this detector proved to be superior to CR-39 detectors whoseproperty for macroautoradiography was previously reported by the authors.The resolutions of these two different type detectors were almost equivalentto each other. The autoradiography taken by way of trial proved thatthis detector could be used to study metabolism and dosimetry of internallydeposited {alpha}-emitters. With further study, the inherent propertiesof this detector such as low background or high sensitivity should extendthe field of track etch imaging technique such as fast neutron radiography.</TEXT></DOC>
