Michael Dukakis has proposed deporting theillegal aliens now in Massachusetts prisons as a measure to relieveovercrowding while saving money.   ``If we can deport them, we're going to deport them,'' Dukakissaid Friday. ``I don't see any reason why the people of this stateought to be supporting folks who are here illegally in the firstplace.''   State Secretary of Human Services Philip Johnston, who overseesthe state corrections system, said, ``We want to try to deport asmany of these people as possible. We'll even pay their airfare.''   State prisons and county jails are overflowing with nearly 13,000inmates in facilities designed to hold 7,100. Inmates are doublingand even tripling up in cells and are even sleeping in hallways,boiler rooms and recreation rooms.   INS Boston district director Charles Cobb welcomed Dukakis'interest in deporting illegal aliens and said the U.S. governmentcan pay their outbound plane fare. ``We have money to move people,''Cobb said.   In the past, the INS waited for jailed illegal immigrants tocomplete their sentences before starting the deportation process.But in January, they stopped waiting and now proceed with the hopethat inmates can be deported when they get out of prison.   Immigrants comprise 10 percent of the state's criminal inmatepopulation, and as many as 80 percent of them could be deported forbeing in this country illegally, according to estimates from thefederal Immigration and Naturalization Service.   ``The governor and I both view this as a top priority,'' Johnstonsaid. ``We want to move quickly to work with INS to deport as manypeople as possible, consistent with public safety.''   He also noted the potential cost saving. The state spends about$30,000 to house each inmate; creating a new prison bed costs$100,000.   If illegal aliens are deported, Johnston said, ``we can saveourselves two or three New Braintrees,'' referring to thecontroversial 500-bed prison planned for that town.</TEXT></DOC>
