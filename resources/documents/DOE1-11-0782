Themethod, developed with the aid of radiochemically labelled arsenic compounds,was applied to the determination of the ratio of inorganic to organicarsenic species in commercial shrimps and in NBS standard reference materialssuch as oysters and orchard leaves. The results show different relativeamounts of inorganic arsenic content in the samples analyzed. (author)13 refs.; 5 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
