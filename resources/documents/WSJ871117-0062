In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7145 West German marks, up 1.5% from 1.6888 Friday. The dollar rose 1% to 137.18 Japanese yen from 135.81, while the British pound fell 1.7% to $1.7405 from $1.77.    The dollar's rise yesterday -- taking it to its highest levels since Nov. 3 -- came entirely in overseas markets, where traders reacted to President Reagan's weekly radio address delivered Saturday. The president said White House and congressional negotiators were close to reaching a &quot;fair and enforceable&quot; accord on reducing the U.S. budget deficit.    He also said negotiators were aiming for a two-year plan to cut the budget deficit by $80 billion. Market participants have said such an accord would bolster the dollar.    &quot;Since everyone is trading on budget news right now, the statement created a bit of (a buying) panic in the Far East, and the dollar went straight up,&quot; Douglas Madison, a corporate trader for BankAmerica International in New York, said.    The dollar came off its highs early in the New York trading day after another Reagan statement cast doubt on the prospects of a budget compromise before the Friday deadline set by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law. Speaking to the American Council of Life Insurance, Mr. Reagan said he is determined to cut the fiscal 1988 deficit by at least $23 billion.    Some investors reportedly thought his use of the $23 billion figure represented a retreat from his statement Saturday that budget negotiators were seeking a $30 billion cut for fiscal 1988, which began Oct. 1. The White House said Mr. Reagan didn't intend to give that impression, but traders said the dollar was sold after the speech.    The dollar fell to 1.7030 marks before moving higher late in the day.    Early Tuesday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency was quoted at 136.80 yen.    As a result of yesterday's rally, some dealers said, a significant agreement on reducing the budget deficit may already be factored into the dollar's value. If so, that would restrict its upside potential when an accord is finally reached.    Trevor W. Woodland, vice president, foreign exchange, at Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank, Chicago, said prospects for a sustained dollar rally, even after a satisfactory budget agreement, are &quot;rather limited.&quot; A period of stability may be the best the currency can do, he said.    &quot;The risk still remains on the downside,&quot; Mr. Woodland said. &quot;If things don't go particularly well (with the budget talks), and we've built in greater expectations than are warranted, then the dollar goes back down and tests 1.65&quot; marks.    Separately, the dollar could benefit this week from a further reduction in short-term West German interest rates. A Bundesbank source said the West German central bank's board probably will reduce the rate on its offering of securities repurchase agreements to 3.25% from 3.5% on the previous such offering.    The U.S. has been pressing Bonn to cut interest rates to stimulate West Germany's domestic economy and its appetite for U.S. imports. Lower West German rates also tend to make dollar-denominated investments more attractive and increase demand for the dollar.    In Brussels, meanwhile, Nigel Lawson, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, said renewed pledges by West Germany and Japan to stimulate domestic demand would be necessary to ensure the success of any new meeting of the Group of Seven major industrial nations.    Speaking at a regular meeting of European Common Market finance ministers, Mr. Lawson and some of the other officials said such a meeting should be held as soon as possible after a U.S. budget accord is reached.    British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, in a speech to bankers and business executives in London's financial district, also called on West Germany and Japan to expand their domestic economies to help avert an international recession.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $1.30 an ounce to $463.30 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 2.4 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $463.80 an ounce in early trading Tuesday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Monday, Nov. 16, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
