(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In a suburb nearly 8,000 miles fromTiananmen Square, a band of Chinese students is working around theclock to relay news from the student rebellion to comradesthroughout China.   Defying a Chinese news blackout, the students are usingtelephones and facsimile machines to contact relatives, otherstudents, hospitals, newspapers and even sympathetic governmentofficials.   Since soliders opened fire on civilians over the weekend, thestudents have been trying to confirm rumored troop movements andcompile an accurate body count.   ``We get very, very different information from differentsources,'' Yuan Liu, a Brandeis University student, said Tuesday.``Many people in Beijing, they figure out that it's at least 30,000died. But here, they're reporting 2,600 died.''   Zhang Longxi, a Harvard University graduate student, scanned atelevision set, looking for some of the young people he had oncetaught English. They had been widely quoted in the early, peacefuldays of the demonstrations because of their English proficiency. Hehasn't seen them since, and wears a black armband, fearing theyhave died.   One student telephoned his mother, a journalist in Shanghai, torelay the latest news of shooting in Beijing. He warned her thattroops were rumored to be headed for Shanghai, and that studentsshould evacuate campuses to avoid bloodshed.   His mother said phone communications between Beijing andShanghai had been all but severed, said the student, who requestedanonymity because he fears retaliation against his parents. He saidhe considered going home, but his parents told him, ``Don't eventhink about that.''   The students have been operating out of the Walker Center forEcumenical Exchange since May 24, when the center's executivedirector, the Rev. Gordon Schultz, offered them half of therambling religious center and three free phone lines.   ``Somehow, the word has spread in China that to get your messageout, call here, because we're getting calls from people we don'tknow,'' Schultz said.   He also persuaded a local hotel to donate a fax machine.   ``Khomeini's revolution was revolution by cassette taperecorder, and this is revolution by fax,'' Schultz said.   Though it has become increasingly difficult to telephone _students believe the cable to Beijing University has been severed _and the phone bill is now more than $20,000, the students aren'tgiving up, said Xiao Xia Gong, a Harvard University graduatestudent and one of the information center's organizers.   ``First we need to get information from China,'' she said. ``Andwe need to give encouragement to students there that they are notforgotten by the world.''   The students also want the Chinese military to know that therest of the worldis monitoring its actions.   The Walker center in this Boston suburb has become a haven forChinese students worried about their loved ones and frustrated bytheir isolation from the momentous events in their homeland.   The students have been passing information gleaned from theirsources to American news organizations, including Voice of America,Schultz said. In some cases their information has been confirmed byWestern media reports hours later, he said, but other reports havebeen impossible to substantiate.   For example, three different sources calling from Canton,Beijing, and Nanjing, have reported seeing soliders with glassyeyes and slack jaws who appear to have been drugged, Schultz said.Rumor in China has it that the soldiers were injected with somemood-altering drug, which they were told was an antibiotic, inorder to make them more willing to deal harshly with the students,he said.   Yuan Liu said the students have been able to reach foreignembassies and banks, but are having trouble reaching privatetelephones in Beijing.   ``It's better if they call us but it's risky because you have togive the operator your name and all the phones are bugged,'' hesaid.   He said one student had managed to get through from a pay phoneto report on the shooting on one of Beijing's thoroughfares,shortly after it began.   A student who studied at Harvard and had returned to Beijingcalled to say that Chinese troops were laughing as they randomlyshot students, Schultz said.   The students are recording and transcribing all of theirtelephone conversations in an attempt to preserve source materialson the democracy movement for history.   The project, dubbed ``Tiananmen 1989 Archives,'' is beingsupported by the Center for East Asian Studies at the University ofChicago, said Zhang Longxi.   ``We feel that this is very, very signifcant in terms of thehistorical moment,'' he said. ``This is going to be veryimportant.''</TEXT></DOC>
