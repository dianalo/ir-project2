President Reagan last week vetoed the Democratic-controlledCongress' first defense bill because he objected to its cuts in hisproposed Star Wars budget and restrictions on nuclear arms controlpolicy.   The $282 billion defense budget bill was the last major itemkeeping the Senate from starting a nearly four-week recess.   When Congress returns after Labor Day, House and Senatenegotiators will meet to iron out differences between the defensebills passed separately by each chamber. The House version approvedtwo months ago contains neither of the major provisions votedThursday.   One difference will be the allied ``burden-sharing'' measureendorsed Thursday on a voice vote by the Senate as part of thedefense spending bill. No similar measure was part of the companionbill approved by the House two months ago.   The Senate provision orders a major review of U.S. overseascommitments, a limit on American troop deployments to Japan andSouth Korea, and a ceiling on spending for U.S. military personnelstationed overseas. The last provision requires the allies to paythe difference if deployment costs of U.S. troops rise above 1988levels.   The Senate rejected, 59-36, another provision calling for a 10percent cut in the total of American dependents living overseaswith servicemen.   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, opposed the dependents' ceilingbecause ``I can't think of anything more damaging to the morale ofour troops than to limit dependents.''   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said, ``Enough is enough. Wehave 413,000 dependents worldwide. That is far more than any othernation in history.''   Legislators of both parties have been increasingly vocal inrecent months in their calls for more help from America's allies,particularly Japan and the European members of the 16-nation NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization.   ``We need help and we need to let our allies know that,'' saidJohnston.   Later, the Senate gave voice vote approval to an amendment bySen. David Pryor, D-Ark., providing strict new reportingrequirements for private consultants to the Pentagon and defensecontractors.   Pryor's plan was prompted by the Pentagon bribery investigation,which involves allegations that consultants were involving inobtaining inside information from Defense Department employeesabout details of planned contracts. No charges have yet been filed.   The amendment requires consultants to register, much aslobbyists for foreign nations must now do, and detail all theirclients and contracts.   Noting the current investigation, Pryor asked, ``How bad do wewant this system to get before we finally pay some attention to it?... We need some mechanism to find out who is working as aconsultant and how many sides of the street they're working.''   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, suggested that hearings should beheld by congressional committees before the requirement isapproved. But he agreed that ``certainly, there's an overwhelmingrevulsion in the country against the bribery scandal in the Navy.''   The measure considered by the Senate was an appropriation bill,which contains money to pay for programs spelled out by separateauthorization legislation in the two-step congressional budgetprocess.   The bill Reagan rejected was the authorization measure, whichproposed $299.5 billion for the Pentagon for the fiscal yearstarting Oct. 1.   The appropriation bill considered by the Senate generallyreflects the spending figures in the earlier bill, although thosetotals may be changed by the House-Senate conference committee. Asa negotiating tactic, the Senate added an amendment to theappropriation bill containing the entire text of the Senate versionof the authorization legislation.   For example, Reagan sought $4.8 billion for the StrategicDefense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. The programreceives $3.9 billion this year.   The bill the president vetoed provided $4.0 billion for StarWars, which he said was too little. The measure considered Thursdaywas based on that $4.0 billion figure, but the Senate version ofthe authorization bill provided $4.6 billion.   In addition, the appropriations bill contains none of the armscontrol restrictions Reagan opposes. Those had been added to theearlier legislation by the House and the conference committee islikely to consider the issue again.   Voting against the bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; MarkHatfield, R-Ore.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; and William Proxmire,D-Wis. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Thad Cochran,R-Miss.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; LowellWeicker, R-Conn.; and James Exon, D-Neb.</TEXT></DOC>
