Reports that Iraq had issued a warning to U.S. officialsabout possible terrorist attacks against American targetsunsettled the market as well, traders said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;You've got an event-driven market where everyone's reallyconcerned about the next move overseas,&quot; compounding fearsabout the domestic situation, said Larry Greenwald, a blocktrader at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded 43.07 to 2582.67-- its sharpest decline since Aug. 23 -- as stocks buckledunder the weight of broad-based selling. Decliners toppedadvancers on the New York Stock Exchange by 1,009 to 430.   Broader indexes weren't hit quite as hard as theindustrial average, but nonetheless dropped sharply. Standardandamp; Poor's 500-Stock Index, for example, went down 3.89 to318.65; its 1.21% drop compared with a 1.64% decline in theDow Jones industrials. The New York Stock Exchange CompositeIndex dropped 1.93 to 175.16 and the Dow Jones Equity MarketIndex fell 3.41 to 295.39.   Meanwhile, the lackluster pace of trading over the pasttwo weeks remained intact despite the market's retreat.&quot;There's just very, very little to do, and it's obviouslyfrustrating,&quot; said Thomas R. Walsh, head of equity trading atNikko Securities International.   Big Board volume amounted to 123,370,000 shares, down fromWednesday's total of 129,890,000 shares.   A flurry of sell programs resulting from stock-indexarbitrage hit the market during the afternoon, contributingto its downturn, traders said. The programs took effect asstock-index futures went down faster that the cash indexes,creating opportunities to profit by purchasing futurescontracts and selling baskets of stocks.   Four major economic reports are scheduled for releasebefore trading opens today, with the August producer priceindex drawing most of the market's interest. The PPIrepresents the first piece of inflation data affected by thesurge in oil prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait.   The index is expected to be up 1.4% for the month,according to a consensus forecast of economists surveyed byDow Jones Capital Markets Report. But analysts believe themarket may pay closer attention to an index of pricesexcluding food and energy, expected to rise 0.3% for August,because a surge in the overall index is being anticipated.   Rao Chalasani, a technical analyst at Prescott, Ball andamp;Turben in Cleveland, said the market's fall may already havediscounted the possibility of a disappointment in the report.&quot;It just has to continue,&quot; he said of the market'slow-volume, sideways movement.   August reports on retail sales, industrial production andcapacity utilization are also on the schedule for thismorning.   As for the deficit-reduction talks, traders said theinability of negotiators to complete a budget package hasbegun taking a toll on the market. &quot;Most people wereenthusiastic that they would have that {agreement} settled bythe end of this week. That doesn't seem to be the case anymore,&quot; said Mr. Walsh of Nikko Securities.   Money-center bank issues were hit with selling as themarket absorbed congressional testimony from Federal ReserveBoard Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said the banking system isfacing &quot;all too many problems&quot; as the quality of loanportfolios at many banks continues to deteriorate.   Chase Manhattan, which fell 1/2 Wednesday in the wake of apoorly received sale of $200 million in notes, lost another3/8 to 16 3/4. Among other money-center issues, Citicorp fell1/4 to 17 3/8, J.P. Morgan eased 1/2 to 32 1/8, BankAmericalost 5/8 to 21 3/4 and Manufacturers Hanover tumbled 1 1/4 to25 5/8.   Digital Equipment dropped 2 3/8 to 59 1/4 in compositetrading of 1.3 million shares, extending a sell-offattributed to disappointment with presentations at twoinvestment conferences earlier in the week and subsequentreductions in several analysts' earnings forecasts. Over thepast three sessions, the stock has lost a total of 5 5/8points, or 8.7%.   John B. Jones, an analyst at Montgomery Securities, saidDigital's presentation at a conference hosted by his firm&quot;didn't leave a lot of hope for a quick turnaround,&quot;according to Dow Jones Professional Investor Report.   Meanwhile, Dean Witter Reynolds lowered its projection ofDigital's fiscal 1991 earnings by $1.05 a share, to $5.15 ashare.   International Business Machines, a strong performer inrecent sessions, skidded 2 7/8 to 105 on 1.1 million shares.Other blue chips that fell sharply included UnitedTechnologies, which tumbled 1 3/4 to 47 7/8; Coca-Cola, whichdipped 7/8 to 41 1/4; and Eastman Kodak, which lost 1 1/8 to40 3/8.   Hilton Hotels, which forecast that its third-quarter netincome from operations would be about 50% lower than a yearearlier, fell 2 1/4 to 29 1/4.   Motorola rose 1/2 to 61 3/8. The Wall Street Journalreported yesterday that the company has reached an agreementin principle with Toshiba to establish a semiconductor jointventure in Scotland, expanding a three-year relationshipbetween the two concerns.   Canadian Pacific gained 1/8 to 15 3/4 on 1.6 millionshares. The company said it plans to repurchase nearly 31.5million of its common shares, or 9.9% of the sharesoutstanding, in a one-year buy-back program starting nextweek.   Corroon andamp; Black, which jumped 6 3/4 in composite tradingWednesday after Aon offered $40 a share for the company,retreated 1 3/8 to 36 1/4 on 1.2 million shares. Britain'sWillis Faber, which previously agreed to a stock-swap mergerof the company, said it is still committed to that offer. Aonfell 1 1/8 to 31 7/8.   MGM/UA Communications, profiled in the Journal's &quot;Heard onthe Street&quot; column, fell 5/8 to 14 5/8.
