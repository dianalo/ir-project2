The Board anticipates publishing anadditional notice of proposed rulemaking to address broader equity investmentissues within the next few months.The proposal would amend the equity-risk investment regulation in two specificareas. First, the Board is proposing to extend its equity-risk investmentregulation for 120 days, until August 14, 1989. This reuglation is currentlyscheduled to sunset on April 16, 1989. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.9-8(h). The Board believes that the additional120 days will allow it to evaluate more carefully the empirical evidenceresulting from the Board's recent proposal to amend its regulatory capitalrequirements and the report on equity-risk investment due to the Congresson February 10, 1989, pursuant to the Competitive Equality Banking Actof 1987 (``CEBA''), Pub. L. No. 100-86, 101 Stat. 552, 661, andSection; 1203(1987), before deciding the best course to take with respect to the futureof the equity-risk investment rule.Second, it would eliminate the exclusion from the definition of ``equitysecurity'' in 12 CFR 563.9-8(b)(2) for stock issued by the Federal NationalMortgage Association (``Fannie Mae'') and the Federal Home Loan MortgageCorporation (``Freddie Mac'') purchased by insured institutions on or afterDecember 14, 1988 or some other appropriate date. Stock issued by theseinstrumentalities, as well as by other, similar, United States government-sponsoredcorporations would be expressly authorized for purposes of the equity-riskinvestment rule, however, pursuant to 12 CFR 563.9-8(d)(1).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before February 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Send comments to: Director, Information Services Section,Office of the Secretariat, Federal Home Loan Bank Board, 1700 G Street,NW., Washington, DC 20552.

Board Res. No. 87-215 (Feb. 27,1987), 52 FR 8188 (March 16, 1987). As part of that amendment, the Boardplaced a sunset date on the then-amended rule of April 16, 1989. <T3>See </T3>52 FR at 8206. The Board explained the reason for the sunsetprovision as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Board has determined that the direct investment rule will expireon April 16, 1989 unless further action is taken by the Board. The Boardcontinues to believe that it is important to reexamine the issues addressedby this rulemaking in order to determine whether this approach has beeneffective in controlling risk and whether further regulatory action isrequired.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20"/><T3>Id.</T3> at 8205.In CEBA, Congress directed the Board to provide notice to the banking committeesnot less than 90 days before final approval is given by the Board to anyregulation that repeals or modifies any regulation that limits direct investmentactivities. CEBA 1203(c)(1), 101 Stat. at 662. That notice is to be givenin the form of a report describing the proposed regulation and the reasonsfor the proposed regulation, including the effect of the regualtory changeon the FSLIC. <T3>Id. </T3>Today's action is intended to satisfy that requirement.Since its inception, the equity-risk investment regulation has been animportant component of the Board's regulatory oversight of the safe andsound operation of all insured institutions. The Board believes that theregulation has served a useful function in controlling risks. As the sunsetdate of April 16, 1989, approaches, one alternative available to the Boardwould be to remove the sunset date without further changes to the rule.For the following reasons, however, the Board is considering whether itshould at this time simply defer the sunset date of the current equity-riskinvestment rule for 120 days in order to allow the Board and its staffadditional time to consider the empirical data that will flow from tworelated Board actions.First, on December 15, 1988, the Board approved a proposal that would substantiallyamend the Board's minimum regulatory capital regulation, 12 CFR 563.13(``capital proposal'').\1\<NOTE/> A major issue covered in the capital proposal was a discussionof the amount of capital an insured institution must maintain against itsassets, including equity-risk investments. Specifically, the Board proposedthat each asset be assigned to a risk category based on the degree of creditrisk associated with the obligor or nature of the obligation.\2\<NOTE/> The Board proposed that all equity-risk investments be placedin a 300 percent risk category (in comparison with a 100 percent risk categoryfor commercial loans). It also discussed the possibility of establishingmore than one risk category for equity-risk investments.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Board Res. No. 88-1342 (Dec. 15, 1988), 53 FR 51800 (Dec.23, 1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ This proposal uses the risk-weighting approach that wasadopted by the international banking regulators in the Basle Agreementand has since been proposed by the federal banking regulators.As an alternative to this risk-weighting treatment of equity-risk investments,the Board is also considering applying the so-called exclusion method tosuch investments. Under this alternative, equity-risk investments wouldnot be considered under any risk category. Instead, an institution wouldexclude the amount of such investments from the calculation of its assetbase for risk-weighting. It then would be required to add that amount directlyto its capital requirement. This method would, therefore, require the institutionto hold capital for its equity-risk investments on a dollar for dollarbasis.As part of the capital proposal, the Board requested comments, with supportingempirical data, on the following issues:<ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Whether equity-risk investments should be considered in a credit-risk-weightingsystem at all; (2) whether and at what levels additional credit-risk categoriesshould be assigned for various types of equity-risk investments; (3) howvarious types of equity-risk investments should be assigned to risk categories* * *.</ITAG>The Board believes that it is important to correlate its action on therequired capital and equity-risk regulations with respect to the viabilityof the current capital thresholds located at 12 CFR 563.9-8(c) and otherrelated issues, including the relative riskiness of various equity-riskinvestments. The additional time provided by delaying the sunset of theequity-risk sunset provision would give the Board the benefit of studyingthe empirical evidence received in response to the proposed minimum capitalregulation, as well as in-house studies performed in response to that portionof the capital proposal.Second, in addition to work performed by Board staff in furtherance ofa final capital regulation, the Board must also compile a report discussingseveral aspects of equity-risk investments as mandated by section 1203of the CEBA. That report, to be submitted to the House Committee on Banking,Finance and Urban Affairs and the Senate Committee on Banking, Housingand Urban Affairs on or before February 10, 1989, will contain, among otherthings: (1) Analyses of the effect of direct investment activities on differentsized insured institutions, state- and federally-chartered insured institutions,and insured institutions in each of the Supervisory Examinations RatingClassifications; (2) findings concerning the degree to which losses tothe FSLIC were the result of direct investment activities; and (3) a comparisonof the effects of direct investment activities made both prior to and onor after April 16, 1987.Clearly, the information contained in this report will provide the Boardand its staff additional data needed to make reasoned decisions as to boththe viability of many subsections of the current equity-risk regulationand the necessity of limiting or modifying the current regulation. To thatend, the Board believes that a short extension of the current equity-riskinvestment rule sunset date, from April 16, 1989 to August 14, 1989, wouldprovide the Board the necessary time to study the empirical evidence availableas a result of the aforementioned activities without a lapse in the Board'soversight in this critical area. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac Stock</ITAG>In the definitional portion of the original equity-risk investment regulation(then referred to as the ``direct investment rule''), the Board expresslyexempted from the ``equity security'' definition, among other things, ``stockissued by a Federal Home Loan Bank, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation,[or] the Federal National Mortgage Association * * *'' Board Res. No. 85-79-A(Jan. 31, 1985), 50 FR 6912, 6928 (Feb. 19, 1985) (codified at 12 CFR 563.9-8(b)(2)(i)).The Board is now, through this proposal, seeking comment on the inclusionof preferred stock issued by Freddie Mac and common stock issued by FannieMae as equity-risk investments.On July 13, 1988, the Board of Directors of Freddie Mac voted in principleto permit the sale of Freddie Mac preferred stock to the general publicas of January 1, 1989. Before this time, Freddie Mac preferred stock was_andwill continue to be until January 1, 1989_held primarily by the approximately3,000 insured institutions that own stock in the Federal Home Loan Banks.The Freddie Mac Board of Directors approved a plan implementing the July13, 1988 vote on August 30, 1988: in exchange for each share of the then-existingclass of preferred stock and a cash payment of $7.00 per old share, FreddieMac offered current holders four shares of a new class of senior participatingpreferred stock without transfer restrictions. Freddie Mac's Board of Directors also acted on July 13, 1988, to increasesequentially the maximum number of shares that any single holder couldown from 150,000 to 600,000 by January 1, 1989. As a result of the four-for-onestock exchange approved on August 30, 1988, that limit was increased fourfoldto 2.4 million shares of the new preferred stock. Given the fact that the stock may now be publicly traded_with all of theconcomitant risks and volatility associated with a publicly traded issue_andthe fourfold rise in the amount of such stock any holder could own, theBoard is now considering whether Freddie Mac preferred stock is subjectto the same risks attending investment in equity securities generally.\3\<NOTE/> Therefore, the Board proposes to remove the exclusion inthe equity-risk definition of ``equity security'' for Freddie Mac preferredstock.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ This treatment would be consistent with the Board's treatmentof stock issued by the Student Loan Marketing Association (``Sallie Mae'').<T3>See </T3>49 FR 48743, 48753 (Dec. 14, 1984). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ All 100,000 shares of Freddie Mac common stock are heldby Federal Home Loan Banks, entities that are not subject to the equity-riskinvestment rule.Moreover, upon reevaluation, the Board also proposes for comment the removalof the exclusion in the equity-risk definition of ``equity security'' forFannie Mae common stock. The Board notes that Fannie Mae stock is alsopublicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange. In light of a reevaluationof the original decision to exclude the stock from the ``equity security''definition and recent stock market fluctuations generally, however, theBoard believes that there is no current justification for the exclusionof Fannie Mae common stock, given the fact that the stock is subject tothe same risks as other equity securities. The Board recognizes that a number of thrift institutions may have investedin Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock in reliance on the existing provisionexempting that stock from the equity-risk investment thresholds. Therefore,today's proposal also amends the definition of ``equity security'' to providethat Freddie Mac preferred stock and Fannie Mae common stock held by insuredinstitutions prior to December 14, 1988 would continue to be exempt fromthe ``equity security'' definition contained in 12 CFR 563.9-8(b)(2).\5\<NOTE/> Selection of this date was deemed proper by the Board inorder to eliminate any incentive for institutions to increase their holdingsin those stocks in anticipation of any final rule. Nevertheless, the Boardsolicits comment regarding an appropriate grandfathering date. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Shares of the ``when-issued'' class of Freddie Mac preferredstock held by an institution prior to December 10, 1988, would be considered``held'' on that date for purposes of this proposal, even though thoseshares will not be issued until January 2, 1989.Despite the fact that the Board today proposes to remove the provisionexcluding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock from the equity-risk definitionof ``equity security,' the Board believes firmly that such investmentsshould be expressly authorized investments for equity-risk purposes, pursuantto 12 CFR 563.9-8(d)(1).\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ By expressly listing such investments in subparagraph(d)(1), the Board would be signifying that an insured institution couldinvest in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac stock up to otherwise authorized thresholds,without having to acquire the approval of the institutions's PrincipalSupervisory Agent.At this time, the Board is proposing for comment the issue of whether theBoard should, in addition, expressly authorize for equity-risk purposesinvestments in equity securities issued by all United States government-sponsoredcorporations. One additional investment included in the proposed category of United Statesgovernment-sponsored corporation equity securities would be the Class Acommon stock recently issued by the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation(``Farmer Mac''). The Board seeks comments on whether the Board shouldinclude Farmer Mac common stock specifically or stock issued by any UnitedStates government-sponsored corporation generally as authorized equity-riskinvestments.The Board anticipates that it will publish for public notice and commentan additional notice of proposed rulemaking addressing broader concernsin the area of equity-risk investment than are within the scope of today'slimited proposal.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to Section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Board is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis.1. <T3>Reasons, objections and legal basis underlying the proposed rule.</T3>These elements are incorporated above in the <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2> regarding the proposal.2. <T3>Small entities to which the proposed rule would apply.</T3> The proposedrule would apply to all insured institutions.3. <T3>Impact of the proposed rule on small entities.</T3> The Small BusinessAdministration defines a small financial institution as ``a commercialbank or savings and loan association, the assets of which, for the precedingfiscal year, do not exceed $100 million.'' 13 CFR 121.13(a).
