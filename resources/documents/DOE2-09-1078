Results of experimental work involving the thermographic characterizationof composite material defects are presented using the Stress PatternAnalysis by Thermal Emission (SPATE) system. Preliminary studies of theeffect of ply orientation and surface coatings on the signal strengthand noise level are presented. The sensitivity of the technique to detectKapton inserts in the laminates and to detect impact damage in thicklaminates is examined. 9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
