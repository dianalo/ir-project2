Hungary will seal its membership by signing the council's humanrights treaty at a ceremony in Rome.   The 1950 treaty established the European Court of Human Rights,which has heard more than 15,000 such cases from the 23 presentcouncil members.   The rights treaty is one of 130 international conventions -ranging from computer data protection to anti-terrorism measures -that Council of Europe nations have signed to date.   Other East European nations are expected to gain admittance nextyear as the 41-year-old council expands its role with Europeemerging from the Cold War.   Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia havebeen given observer status as a step toward full membership.Romania and Albania may become observers soon, officials said.   For membership, a country must be a pluralistic democracy andmust sign the human rights convention.   The Strasbourg-based council has long existed in the shadow ofother organizations, notably the more powerful European Community,a separate 12-nation body based in Brussels, Belgium.   But the council is now seeking to become the primary bodybringing together nations from both sides of the former IronCurtain.   ``The countries of Eastern Europe urgently need a structurecapable of accommodating them and assisting them on the path todemocratic reform,'' said Catherine Lalumiere, the council'ssecretary general.   The Council of Europe wants to form a 300-seat assembly oflegislators from among the 34 European and North American nationsin the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and becomeEurope's chief human rights watchdog.   In both cases, the council would take on activities of the CSCE,a loosely defined body established in 1975 as a forum foroccasional talks between former Cold War adversaries, especially onhuman rights and security issues. The conference includes theUnited States, Canada and all of Europe except Albania.   Many European governments now believe the conference must bestrengthened and see the Council of Europe as the rightorganization for the job.   ``It would be both logical and reasonable for the Council ofEurope to be given a mandate by the CSCE to continue thatconference's work by implementing the principles which it has laiddown,'' Ms. Lalumiere said.   Only the United States has raised objections to the plan.   But the other conference members may decide to push for aparliamentary assembly without immediate U.S. participation, saidAnders Bjorck of Sweden, president of the Council's ParliamentaryAssembly.   ``The U.S. position is causing widespread irritation to say theleast,'' Bjorck said. ``But we will not change our position.''   A conference summit is scheduled for Nov. 19-21 in Paris. Themeeting is expected to be highlighted by the signing of aNATO-Warsaw Pact accord ordering deep cuts in conventional forcesfrom the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains.</TEXT></DOC>
