Partially assembled spacer frames formed by a plurality of joinedspacer frame segments are advanced past a sealant applying station definedby first and second sealant extrusion nozzles positioned for applyingsealant to opposite spacer frame segment sides and a third sealant extrusionnozzle positioned for applying sealant to the exterior spacer frame side.Extrusion nozzle controllers allow the nozzles to apply sealant to thespacer frame segments in response to control signals. A spacer framedetection system produces signals indicating the presence of the spacerframe at the sealant application station. A signal processor coupledto the detection system and to the nozzle controller produces controlsignals for intermittently operating the third extrusion nozzle in responseto the presence of the leading end of the spacer frame segments at saidstation, and the approach of the junctures of subsequent spacer framesegments ends and the trailing frame end. The signal processor also providessignals for operating the first and second nozzles continuously whilethe spacer frame is at the station. 14 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
