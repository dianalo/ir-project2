OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A moderate earthquake centered in eastern Kentucky shook homesand rattled residents in five states but caused no major damage orreports of injuries, officials say.   ``It practically shook me out of the chair,'' Betty Raines ofHuntington, Ohio, said after Tuesday night's quake, whichregistered 4.5 on the Richter scale and was also felt in Kentucky,Indiana, Tennessee and West Virginia.   The quake struck at 10:28 p.m. EDT, and was centered about 40miles northeast of Lexington, Ky., and 65 miles southwest ofAshland, according to the National Earthquake Information Center inGolden, Colo.   An aftershock was recorded a few minutes later, said GregSteiner, technical director of the Center for Earthquake Researchand Information at Memphis State University in Tennessee.   ``It scared me to death,'' said Mary Welch, state Disaster andEmergency Services coordinator in Montgomery County, Ky., near theepicenter.   Ms. Welch said the reported damage included falling plaster atan apartment building in the county seat of Mount Sterling.Long-distance phone service was knocked out in parts of MountSterling.   Some phone service was lost in neighboring Bath County and aclock was ``knocked from my wall,'' said emergency coordinatorVernon Barber.   In Owingsville, the quake jarred an air conditioner out of awall of the county jail, said Ronnie Beadle, deputy jailer anddispatcher.   Hundreds of Cincinnati residents jammed police switchboards toreport the temblor, authorities said.   ``We've had at least 500 people call in here,'' Richard Young,Hamilton County Communication Center supervisor in Cincinnati, saidabout an hour after the quake. ``Everybody and their aunt called inhere to find out what happened or make sure we knew about it.''   ``My door cracked open when it happened. I could hear it,'' saidKris Sommer, a resident of the Dayton, Ohio, suburb of Amberly.   The quake also was felt in Putnam County, W.Va., nearCharleston, said Sheriff's Deputy K.D. Watson.   ``We got a couple of calls from people who said their houseswere shaking, but one guy said his house shakes all the time,''Watson said.   The region's last strong quake occurred June 10, 1987, when atemblor registering 5.0 on the Richter scale shook residents in 16states from Kansas to South Carolina and parts of Canada, breakingwindows and tumbling chimneys.   That quake occurred along the New Madrid Fault, a 150-mile crackin the earth from northern Arkansas to southern Illinois.   Tuesday night's quake was not related to that fault, butoccurred in a region ``laced with fault lines'' covering part ofTennessee, southern Kentucky and Virginia, Steiner said.   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,6 severe damage. A 7 reading is a ``major'' earthquake, capable ofwidespread heavy damage; 8 is a ``great'' quake, capable oftremendous damage.   The San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which occurred before theRichter scale was devised, has been estimated at 8.3 on the Richterscale.</TEXT></DOC>
