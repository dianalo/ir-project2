Still, the British pound's relative resilience helped to reassurethe stock market that British rates could perhaps hold at currentlevels.   ``Nobody's panicking yet,'' commented one dealer.   At the close the FT-SE 100-share index was down 27.4 points, or1.24 percent, at 2182.0. Volume slowed to 426.8 million shares fromWednesday's 456.6 million shares.   Dealers and analysts noted the London market had been vulnerableto bad news following its recent strong runup on relatively littlevolume.   Dealers and analysts say nervousness is likely to persist asparticipants wait to see how the pound weathers British inflationdata and further reports on Britain's trade deficit in coming weeks.   ``The (equity) market won't get carried away until the trend inthe balance of payments is confirmed to be improving and until thereis an improvement in the inflation profile,'' Reynolds said. This islikely to keep the British market on hold at least until latesummer, the Prudential-Bache economist predicted.</TEXT></DOC>
