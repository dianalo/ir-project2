Getting past the Secret Service, he climbs up the back of the podium and begins shooting over Jesse Jackson's shoulder to get the picture he wants.    &quot;Jackson was flat today, so I tried different angles to get more excitement in the pictures,&quot; explains the 12-year-veteran cameraman for the network. &quot;I want the best shot I can get.&quot;    So does the Jackson presidential campaign. Like all political campaigns, it eagerly assists the network camera operators, frequently staging elaborate media events for the sake of great video. &quot;They're trying to get the best picture, and we want them to as well,&quot; acknowledges Denise Lee, Jackson spokeswoman.    The pictures shot by Mr. Prentnieks and other camera operators capture the campaign for millions of TV viewers around the nation. It is often the camera operator's artistic pictures, more than substance, that determine what's shown on TV news. Politicians play to the cameraperson's artistic instinct in the all-important quest for so-called &quot;free media.&quot;    &quot;A campaign without a good cameraman is like a painter without hands,&quot; says Roger Stone, a Republican consultant. &quot;The cameraman determines what the voters will see about your candidate, and how people feel about him from these pictures is more important than what he says.&quot;    &quot;The cameraperson is the most underanalyzed and underrated component of political coverage,&quot; says Peter Jennings, ABC News anchor. &quot;The cameraperson has an enormous amount of freedom to portray the candidate in a particular light -- much like choosing to picture your good side or your bad side.&quot;    The power of TV news pictures is awesome, frequently leaving viewers with lasting images that can help or haunt a politician for years. &quot;The cameraman's pictures can make or break a candidate,&quot; says Edward Fouhy, a former political producer at NBC News and now a fellow at Harvard University's Institute of Politics. But he adds: &quot;There is nothing ideological about how the cameraman takes his pictures -- he just wants the best picture.&quot;    For example, when Sen. Robert Dole's campaign was in trouble after trashing George Bush, camera crews found it irresistible to shoot Sen. Dole with the Frankenstein monster when the Republican was campaigning at a movie-studio site in Orlando, Fla. The pictures appeared on network news that evening.    And no matter what President Gerald Ford was saying, his tripping and stumbling before the camera is what got the media play -- and therefore became etched in the minds of many. &quot;The press always prefers to show the candidate flubbing up or falling on his face,&quot; says Michael Robinson, a Georgetown University professor specializing in media and politics. &quot;That can be the best picture to the cameraman -- not what would be the best picture for the candidate.&quot;    And a big part of the cameraperson's job is to be in position partly in case the candidate stumbles. During Mr. Jackson's California campaign swing, the 39-year-old Mr. Prentnieks rushes out of the plane at each stop, grabs his camera gear from the baggage compartment, and gets in place before the candidate comes down the stairs. Mr. Prentnieks says he and an NBC cameraman agree not to actually roll tape on one deplaning, but both are set up &quot;just in case the Reverend falls or, worse, gets shot at.&quot;    Mr. Prentnieks, who has worn a bulletproof vest when covering Mr. Jackson, puts his pictures even ahead of campaign security precautions. When the Secret Service hurriedly began an unusual search of the press's bags and equipment, Mr. Prentnieks sensed a problem and began recording the event. The agents asked him to stop but he continued to shoot. His video appeared that night on the CBS Evening News with a story about the Secret Service discovering a bullet on the Jackson campaign plane.    Mr. Prentnieks, a serious and thoughtful Midwesterner with a dry wit, views his job simply: &quot;I never worry about helping or hurting a campaign. If I see a shot worth getting, I want it.&quot;    But the cameraman makes subjective decisions every day. When a Jackson news conference is disrupted by protesters, Mr. Prentnieks moves toward the protesters to size up the shot, but decides against it. &quot;I don't want to give these guys any credence,&quot; he says.    His control is tempered, however, by his lack of final say over which of his pictures appear on air. On this day of shooting several hours of videotape, he passes the tapes on to producers and editors who decide what pictures to use and how much time to give them. &quot;It's frustrating that once I take the pictures, I have no more control,&quot; Mr. Prentnieks laments.    A mix of professional pride and competitive fear motivates him. He also acknowledges something of a professional split personality: &quot;I'm part journalist, part artist,&quot; he says.    The artistic inclination makes a camera operator vulnerable to politicians who cater to the insatiable demand for the prize shot. Campaigns try to replicate the highly successful &quot;Michael Deaver touch,&quot; named after President Reagan's former image-maker. &quot;Campaign advance men and cameramen have an almost symbiotic relationship,&quot; notes Mr. Fouhy, the former NBC News producer. &quot;They have the same interest in finding the most symbolic and aesthetically pleasing pictures.&quot;    TV news frequently &quot;is obliged to write to the pictures,&quot; acknowledges Mr. Jennings of ABC, because television is a visual medium. Even when the correspondents state facts that contradict the television images, the pictures typically speak louder than words.    In Martin Schram's book &quot;The Great American Video Game,&quot; CBS News correspondent Lesley Stahl recounts bracing for scalding criticism for what she viewed as a tough piece pointing out how many of Mr. Reagan's policies were opposite of the impressions he was giving Americans in carefully orchestrated media events. Instead, right after the piece aired, she received a phone call from a White House aide who said he &quot;loved&quot; the story for giving &quot;great pictures of Ronald Reagan and that's all the American people see.&quot;    This campaign season, the colorful video of Michael Dukakis doing a lively Greek dance was the stuff that makes for memorable TV pictures. The shots of Mr. Dukakis's smiling face, his hands flying in the air, his feet shuffling on the floor, led CBS and many of its local affiliates to show a long, 30-second or so sequence of Mr. Prentnieks's footage. Normally such a media event would be lucky to get five seconds on the air. The Dukakis campaign loved it.    Mr. Prentnieks will go to just about any extreme to get the prize shot, often hanging out of planes, cars and trains. CBS's major piece on the presidential campaign of evangelist Pat Robertson ran long, with about three minutes of great video of the candidate on a bus tour of Iowa, which Mr. Prentnieks shot by hanging out of a car window speeding ahead of and alongside the bus, in the wrong lane of traffic.    While a cameraman has to be alert and ready to shoot at anything, there's a lot of &quot;hurry up and wait&quot; in the job, Mr. Prentnieks complains. He carries a book to read, with pictures of his attorney wife and two-year-old daughter tucked inside. The CBS cameraman will earn more than $100,000 this year, because of overtime pay and the extensive travel schedule without days off. &quot;The Jackson campaign is a money maker,&quot; he observes, &quot;because of its long hours.&quot;    The job of cameraman is often grueling. Mr. Prentnieks must haul heavy equipment, and maneuver through crowds and occasionally violence to get the best shot. In the 1984 campaign, he put his foot through a glass coffee table trying to get a good shot of Sen. John Glenn.    But the tough exterior doesn't mean he ignores the tender moments. His favorite shots -- which politicians are sure to be happy about -- are of babies' faces. At a Jackson rally here, Mr. Prentnieks is getting footage of a baby in her mother's arms as she cheers for the Democratic hopeful. When the baby drops a rattle, Mr. Prentnieks scoops it up and puts it in the baby's fist -- still listening to Mr. Jackson's speech with his camera rolling. </TEXT></DOC>
