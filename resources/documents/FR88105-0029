The Debt Collection Act of 1982, Pub. L. 97-365, amended section 5514 topermit interagency recovery of general debts due the United States. However,before agencies may use this new recovery procedure, certain due processrights must be extended to the debtor. The specific procedures in thisproposed regulation conform with the statutory provisions added to 5 U.S.C.5514 by the Debt Collection Act and court decisions emphasizing the debtor'sright to due process protection prior to the initiation of an action torecover for a debt (<T3>Califano </T3>v. <T3>Yamasaki, </T3>442 U.S. 682 (1979)). On March 9, 1984, the Government Accounting Office and the Department ofJustice adopted final regulations amending the Federal Claims CollectionStandards (FCCS). Although the installment collection from the currentpay account of an employee described in these proposed regulations is authorizedby 5 U.S.C. 5514, such a collection is still an administrative offset asdefined in 31 U.S.C. 3701(a)(1). Consequently, any collection matters involvingsalary offset not addressed in these regulations are governed by the FCCS.In essence the proposed regulations provide that the Board shall not deductmoneys from the current pay of one of its employees in order to satisfya debt owed by that employee to the United States until it has affordedthe employee a pre-offset hearing before an impartial adjudicator. However,there are three types of collections against pay which are not subjectto the full procedural rights provided by these proposed regulations. The first is a collection which has resulted from an overpayment causedby an employee's election of coverage or a change in coverage under a federalbenefit program. An employee who makes such an election is aware, or reasonablyshould be aware, that the election would cause a change in the amount withheldfrom his or her salary. Accordingly, it is appropriate to exclude fromthe scope of the salary offset due process procedures routine ``catch-up''retroactive collections which are necessary solely because of brief, necessary,and inevitable processing delays. A similar situation exists with regard to ministerial adjustments of payrates or allowances, <T3>e.g., </T3>credit union allotment, union dues deduction, etc., whichcannot be placed into effect immediately because of normal processing delays.The debt in this case does not arise from any error committed by eitherthe employee or the agency. The validity of the obligation is beyond reasonabledispute and the amount due is readily ascertainable. For these two types of collections the proposed regulations provide fora limited procedure whereby the employee is notified in advance of theamount of the retroactive collection and may dispute the retroactive collectionby notifying a specified official. Furthermore, it should be noted thatin collections by salary offset made for reasons other than normal processingdelays or, even if made by reason of normal processing delays but wherethe period for which retroactive deduction must be made will exceed fourpay periods, the full due process procedures set out in the proposed regulationsshall apply. Finally, where there is no question regarding credibility and veracity,no pre-offset hearing will be granted. In these cases the Board will makeits pre-offset determination under this part based upon a review of thewritten record. Such a provision in the regulation is consistent with theFCCS (4 CFR 102.3(c)). In addition, these proposed regulations also cover the situation in whichthe Board is not the creditor agency but merely the paying agency of thedebtor. In such situations, the proposed regulations provide that thisagency will commence deductions from the current pay account of an employeeupon receipt of a properly certified debt claim as provided by 5 CFR 550.1108.This regulation is consistent with the Office of Personnel Management'sregulation. (5 CFR 550.1101, <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule is not a major rule as defined under section 1(b) of ExecutiveOrder 12291 (46 FR 13193, 3 CFR 1981 Comp., p. 127) and, therefore, a regulatoryimpact analysis has not been prepared. In addition, any information requiredto be furnished under this rule is information to be provided by a governmentemployee or agency and, therefore, is not covered by the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 20 CFR Part 361 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Government employees, Wages, Debtcollection.1.
