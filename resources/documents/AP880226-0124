District Judge John McKellips raised the issue at a sheriff'sdeputies' meeting while comparing his qualifications with Mary AnneBramblett's.   Bramblett, an assistant county attorney, has less than six yearsexperience as a lawyer and is seeking to become the county's firstfemale state judge. Because there is no Republican candidate, thewinner of their March 8 Democratic primary will capture the 41stDistrict judge's seat.   The incumbent judge suggested Bramblett and other mothers shouldstay home with their young children.   ``She had to take some time out for maternity leave to have twosmall children, so I don't know how much time she's actually spentworking as an attorney,'' he added Wednesday night.   The judge also linked absent mothers to the problem ofovercrowded jails and prisons.   ``What do we do (about crowded prisons)? Well, we can start inour homes,'' he said. ``Mothers can stay home and raise theirchildren during the formative years.''   The judge continued the theme Thursday in an interview with theEl Paso Times.   ``No one who will be truthful will deny the importance of amother being with children during pre-school years,'' he said.``Other persons may try to substitute and mean well, but there's nosubstitute for a mother's love.''   The judge's views were surprising, Bramblett said.   ``Everybody got the clear message that (McKellips believes) I amnot qualified to be a judge because I'm a woman and a mother,''said Bramblett, whose children are 3 and 4 years old.   The judge's comments to the sheriff's deputies association weremade in the context of crime rates and the cause of crime, he said.   ``I acknowledge it would have been more correct to have used theterm `parent' rather than mother,'' he said in the Thursdayinterview. ``The whole point of this discussion is a breakdown ofparental guidance in the home, whether that breakdown is the faultof the mother or the father.''   He said, ``As a district judge, one never has a normal life. Todo your job properly requires long hours and extra devotion, andshe would have less time as a judge to be with her family than shehas had in the past. It appears that Mrs. Bramblett's personalambitions are more important to her than the lives of herchildren.''   ``It's not true,'' Bramblett said. ``I think my children have avery good role model to look up to, both myself and my husband.''</TEXT></DOC>
