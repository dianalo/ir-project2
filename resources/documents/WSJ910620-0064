Introduced in 1982, MRI machines account for about $1.2billion of the estimated $7.4 billion-a-year globalmedical-equipment and servicing market. But manufacturersthink MRI's share can be expanded significantly by newapplications now being introduced and under development.</LP><TEXT>   Because most current machines take about nine minutes tocomplete an image, they are limited to &quot;photographing&quot; thebrain, spine, joints and other stationary organs. Butupgraded with new technologies that can scan in less than asecond, MRI will soon be able to produce images of suchmoving organs as the lungs, heart and liver, say doctors andengineers.   Advanced NMR Systems Inc., based in Woburn, Mass., forexample, has started to market an MRI technology that candiagnose heart and liver diseases without using X-rays andradioactive materials. General Electric Co.; Siemens AG, ofGermany; and N.V. Philips, of the Netherlands are alsopreparing to field their versions of the next MRI generation.   The impetus for cutting scanning time is also coming fromthe pressure on hospitals to reduce health-care costs. Thetypical $850 fee for an MRI scan has been a particulartarget. Hospitals hope that faster scanning would increasethe number of patients that can be put through the machineand hence lower the per-patient cost. A typical MRI scancurrently takes about 45 minutes, including the time forsetting up patients. The technologies being developed wouldreduce that time to 20 minutes, according to themanufacturers.   &quot;MRI has the potential of replacing angiography, CT{computed tomography} scanning, and myelography,&quot; says SadekHilal, director of neuroradiology at Columbia PresbyterianMedical Center in New York, referring to diagnosticprocedures that subject the body to X-rays and radioactivetracers. He adds that with incremental speed increases inrecent years, MRI &quot;already has replaced 70% to 80% of thediagnosis CT scanning and myelography are designed to do.&quot; Atypical CT examination costs between $350 and $450.   Optimistic projections for MRI drive the currenttechnology race. But having discovered more than one way toattain their goals, most manufacturers are closely guardingtheir choices before they introduce them in coming years.&quot;Your market share can double or be cut in half, dependingupon how you have placed your bets,&quot; says Thomas Miller, vicepresident, MRI, at Siemens Medical Systems Inc., a unit ofSiemens AG.   MRI works by means of a powerful magnet that surrounds apatient lying in the machine's cylindrical chamber. Themagnet excites the body's hydrogen nuclei to emit radiofrequencies. These &quot;signals&quot; are captured by a systemconsisting of antennas and a &quot;gradient&quot; coil, driven by anamplifier, which relays them to a computer that transformsthe signals into images.   Four years ago, the machine took 15 minutes to produce animage, says Morry Blumenfeld, general manager, advanced MRIproducts, at GE's Medical Systems unit in Milwaukee. Abouthalf the improvement since then has come from advances insoftware, and the other half from incremental changes in thehardware. But such changes are &quot;going to take us only sofar,&quot; he says.   GE Medical and others are testing major changes in thecoils, amplifiers and other hardware. Like his rivals, Mr.Blumenfeld declines to say which technology GE will field --only that the company will decide on it in about a year.   MRI makers acknowledge, however, that they are pursuingthree major ways to speed scanning, each requiring differentengineering:   -- The first is to develop small, individual magnets andcoils for specific parts of the body, instead of thetotal-body system of the present machines. &quot;Localized&quot; coilsare more efficient in capturing and transmitting data.   -- The second approach uses a more advanced gradient coil,which is the basis of Advanced NMR System's recentlyintroduced technology. The finely tuned coil homes in on thetargeted hydrogen atoms in the body in half a millisecond,compared with eight milliseconds for the coils in existingMRI machines. The speed, as well as improved signals thatresult from the new coil, allow a scan to be completed in 0.1second, says Paul Bollinger, president of Advanced NMR.   -- In a third, so-called &quot;brute force&quot; approach, thegradient coil itself remains the same but is &quot;driven&quot; by amore powerful battery of amplifiers than in existing MRImachines. The additional power increases the coil's capacityto transmit more signals with fewer distortions.   None of these approaches, however, offer the idealcombination of high speed with image quality, low cost andflexibility to scan something as simple as a knee joint or ascomplex as blood flow, according to manufacturers. That's thereason that GE, after jointly improving the gradient-coiltechnology with Advanced NMR, has decided not to sell it yet.But it's allowing Advanced NMR to sell a $500,000 MRI upgradeto GE customers. The cost aside, the GE customers who buy thetechnology may face the possibility of falling out of stepwith the path GE might finally adopt. &quot;The customer may haveto throw that out {in the future} to get back into ourevolutionary path,&quot; GE's Mr. Blumenfeld acknowledges.   &quot;We frankly don't know at this point which technology isgoing to come out ahead,&quot; he says.   For now, however, the Advanced NMR technology gets highmarks from radiologists familiar with it. &quot;Right now, it'struly the most advanced,&quot; said Columbia Presbyterian's Mr.Hilal. Mark Cohen, technical director of clinical MRI atMassachusetts General Hospital, who is among a group usingthe machine for research, says, &quot;It's the only system thatgives you images of the heart in real time.&quot;   Taking pictures of the heart in 0.05 second, he says,allows him to study the blood flow through coronary arteries,muscle response in stroke and diseases associated with heartvalves. &quot;These weren't possible or practical to study indetail with any other diagnostic tool,&quot; Mr. Cohen says. &quot;Themachine that comes closest is ultrasound, but it has itslimitations.&quot;   Mr. Cohen says he is also scanning the flow of blood intothe brain to assess tissue health. &quot;The closest to gettingthat kind of information is through PET {positron-emissiontomography}, but PET involves injecting radioactive tracers,&quot;he notes. &quot;We've also had dramatic success in imaging theliver, the site of many diseases.&quot;   MRI won't totally displace other diagnostic tools, someradiologists say. &quot;One of the problems with fast imaging isthat it cuts down on resolution. If, someday, someone comesout with an MRI machine that has as good a resolution as theCT machine, that will kill CT. But I don't think that's goingto happen,&quot; says James Hoffman, a radiologist at EmoryUniversity Medical School in Atlanta.</TEXT></DOC>
