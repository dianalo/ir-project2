The FDIC chief, William Seidman, in testimony before theSenate Banking Committee, also said that lowering the$100,000 insurance ceiling on individual accounts wouldn'tsave the government much money in bank and savings-and-loanfailures. Mr. Seidman, when asked about attempting to limitdepositors to one insured account -- another idea popular onCapitol Hill -- said it deserves to be studied but would pose&quot;great administrative problems.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   To lower possible costs to the government, the FDIC chiefrecommended placing stricter limits on the lending areas inwhich banks can use insured deposits. He also called forinternational agreements to set procedures for handlingfailures of big financial institutions. Bailouts of big bankshave accounted for most of the FDIC's costs in recent years,but regulators have been reluctant to impose larger losses ondepositors in the big banks partly because authorities inother countries usually cover all deposits in failures. Mr.Seidman and other regulators have pointed out that U.S. bankscould lose customers if their depositors are treated moreharshly than depositors in banks overseas.   Mr. Seidman told the committee that spreading real estateproblems and other loan woes could cause enough bank failuresto give the FDIC's bank insurance fund a major loss thisyear. A month ago, a top aide to Mr. Seidman suggested that aloss was likely this year and that a $2 billion loss was the&quot;worst-case scenario&quot; if a big bank failure occurred.Yesterday, Mr. Seidman's comments appeared to indicate thatthe agency believes a big loss is likely.   Asked by reporters about the likelihood of a $2 billionloss, Mr. Seidman said that &quot;it's not unreasonable to saythat's the preferred prediction.&quot; But he would neitherelaborate nor say whether the FDIC expects a large bankfailure. Though FDIC officials won't discuss individualinstitutions, the focus of attention is clearly on ailingNortheast banks, in particular Boston-based Bank of NewEngland, which has been forced to set aside hundreds ofmillions of dollars for possible real estate losses and wasprodded into a management shake-up by regulators.   Asked about the general economic situation in the region,Mr. Seidman said, &quot;I don't think conditions are improving inNew England. They may be hitting bottom.&quot;   The FDIC's bank fund now stands at $13.2 billion, afterlosses of $851 million in 1989 and $4.24 billion in 1988, thefirst losses in the agency's history.   The $13.2 billion translates to about 70 cents for every$100 in insured deposits at banks, a figure policymakersbelieve is dangerously low. The FDIC believes that $1.25 foreach $100 is a healthy level, and last year'ssavings-and-loan bailout bill increased the premiums paid bybanks with the goal of rebuilding the fund.   With political sensitivity high over Congress's role inthe Sandamp;L debacle, several senators pressed Mr. Seidmanyesterday about whether the FDIC will be able to handlefuture bank failures without calling on taxpayer funds. &quot;Asfar as we can tell now, the {insurance} fund is adequate tohandle any failures that we can identify at this time,&quot; Mr.Seidman said.   The FDIC chairman noted that real estate loan problemscontinue to plague banks and show no signs of abating.Moreover, he said, as banks have lost many of their bestcorporate borrowers to the securities markets they have beenforced into making real estate lending a bigger portion oftheir business. &quot;Many banks' earnings are directly related toreal estate values,&quot; Mr. Seidman said. And, he said, &quot;We havethe weakest real estate markets that we've seen in thiscountry for many years.&quot;   On the issue of deposit insurance reform and restructuringthe financial industry, Mr. Seidman renewed his calls fortearing down the barriers that prevent banks from fullyentering securities, insurance and other lines of business.He echoed testimony last week by Treasury Secretary NicholasBrady, who said that making banks more profitable andcompetitive is as important as changing the deposit insurancesystem itself.   But Mr. Seidman suggested that the government could limitits exposure to the risky activities by limiting banks tousing insured deposits in &quot;reasonable, conservative and safe&quot;investments such as home mortgages and loans to highly ratedcorporations. Mr. Seidman didn't offer specific proposals forchange, because the Treasury Department is studying depositinsurance and the financial industry and plans to makerecommendations by early next year.</TEXT></DOC>
