The state's voters seem to favor by nearly 2-1 aninitiative on the ballot Nov. 5 that would limit its entirecongressional delegation to just one more term. Housemembers, including Speaker Thomas Foley, would be forced outbeginning with the 1994 election. And if the vote goes asexpected, the U.S. Supreme Court probably will have the lastword on whether the politically punishing propositionviolates the U.S. Constitution.</LP><TEXT>   Also affected are 147 state legislators, and Gov. BoothGardner, who announced this week that he won't seek a thirdterm next year. The governor couldn't run again anyway if theinitiative passes, but he said that fact didn't affect hisdecision. The initiative lets former officials run again foroffice but only after a six-year absence. Support for thepackage of limits has snowballed in the wake of publicityabout congressional privileges and, in some quarters, afterthe Senate Judiciary Committee's handling of the hearingsthis month on Mr. Thomas's nomination to the high court.   &quot;We could not be running a better campaign for the otherside,&quot; says Republican Rep. Sid Morrison.   While odds favor passage of what is known as Initiative553, the odds also appear against it withstanding a courtchallenge, particularly to its limits on federal officials,although the initiative has its legal defenders.   &quot;There are a few crank political scientists, a very few,who are toying around with the idea of term limitations,&quot;says Nelson W. Polsby of the Institute of GovernmentalStudies at the University of California at Berkeley. &quot;Evenmost of them concede a constitutional amendment would benecessary, and the vast bulk of political scientists think itis completely wacko.&quot;   Courts, for instance, have generally held that statescan't impose qualifications on candidates for federal officebeyond the U.S. Constitution's age, residence and citizenshiprequirements.   A California law imposing residency requirements on U.S.Senate candidates, for instance, was invalidated in the1960s, says William Cohen, a Stanford University lawprofessor.   Also shot down have been attempts to bar felons fromrunning for Congress and to prohibit incumbent statelegislators from simultaneously holding federal posts, saysEdward Younglove, an Olympia, Wash., attorney who sued onbehalf of several lawmakers in August to have Initiative 553removed from the ballot. The Washington state Supreme Courtrejected the suit, but on grounds of its timing rather thanits merits.   &quot;There is no chance that this initiative will be foundconstitutional,&quot; says Rep. Foley, a plaintiff in the case anda congressman since 1964. &quot;It is not even a matter of subtleinterpretation.&quot;   But proponents of 553 say term limits are permissibleunder another constitutional provision that allows states toregulate the time, place and manner of elections. Under thatprovision, for instance, courts have upheld the right ofstates to require federal candidates to post filing fees orto bar them from a general election if they lost in aprimary.   Wallace M. Rudolph, a University of Puget Sound lawprofessor and legal adviser to the Initiative 553 campaign,says that if the issue ever reaches the U.S. Supreme Court,term-limit proponents might benefit from the court's growingsuspicion of congressional power and sensitivity to states'rights. Justice Thomas's past writings suggest he will add tothis tilt.   Washington would be the fourth state to approve termlimits, but the way its law would affect sitting federalofficeholders has made it a subject of national attention.Colorado last year became the first state to limitcongressional service, but because that law won't force anyretirements until 2002, it hasn't been challenged in court.This month, the California Supreme Court upheld the state'sterm-limit law for state legislators when it ruled thatvoter-approved Proposition 140 was a valid protection againsta &quot;dynastic legislative bureaucracy.&quot;   Numerous interest groups have lined up against 553,including the League of Women Voters, the National RifleAssociation and the Washington State Grange. The state'slargest employers, including Boeing Co. and Kaiser AluminumCorp., are among the opposition campaign's biggest donors.The biggest is a unit of Philip Morris Cos., which haspitched in $25,000.   For his part, Rep. Morrison, a six-term veteran, says heprobably could get a job back on the family farm if theinitiative becomes law. A few years ago, he says, he evenco-sponsored federal term-limit legislation that would leadto a constitutional change, though it died quickly.   But Mr. Morrison fears that his state could be at adisadvantage if it were alone in losing its experiencedleadership. &quot;We have used that seniority and strength toprotect the state from things that citizens are not evenaware of,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
