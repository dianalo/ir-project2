Such a move would go against the grain of current bankingtrends. While much of the current talk of consolidation inU.S. banking circles revolves around possible mergers betweencross-town rivals to reduce overhead, A. Robert Abboud, FirstCity's chairman and chief executive officer, envisions a&quot;special relationship&quot; with one or more major internationalbanks, possibly including foreign institutions.</LP><TEXT>   In an interview, Mr. Abboud said he wants First City, arelative lightweight with assets of less than $14 billion, tobe able to take advantage of opportunities presented byEurope's economic integration and the decline of worldCommunism.   &quot;What we're looking for is to be tied into a network thatwould be world-wide,&quot; he said. He added that &quot;a number ofinternational institutions&quot; have expressed interest in FirstCity's plans.   &quot;The good news is we've got competition and we've gotinterest,&quot; he said.   Both Bank of New York Co. and BankAmerica Corp. have sentteams to Texas to examine First City's loan portfolio inrecent weeks, according to people close to the situation.Neither bank would comment.   The move comes at a time when First City is struggling tokeep pace with some of its Texas competitors. Both NCNB Corp.of Charlotte, N.C., and Banc One Corp. of Columbus, Ohio,have bought large Texas banking franchises with liberal dosesof federal assistance and have set about blanketing the statewith branches and billboards.   First City, by contrast, has faltered a bit since it wasrecapitalized in 1988 by an investor group led by Mr. Abboud.Its federal assistance package wasn't as generous as somecompetitors' packages, and it has been plagued recently byreports of problems in its loan portfolio. First City sayssuch reports are overblown.   The immediate reason for First City's urge to forge analliance stems from its need to refinance an expensive, $125million issue of preferred stock, according to Mr. Abboud.   When the preferred shares were first issued, First City'sinvestment bankers assumed holders would eventually convertthem into common stock. (The shares are convertible afterApril 15 at a conversion rate of $27.22 a common share.) Butthe company's stock price, after nearing $40 a share lastyear, has tanked in recent months. In composite trading onthe New York Stock Exchange yesterday, First City sharesclosed at $19.125, down 25 cents.   If the stock doesn't recover sufficiently by April, FirstCity will either have to pay some $150 million to redeem thepreferred stock or begin paying an onerous dividend equal tothe prime rate of interest, the rate banks charge their bestcustomers, plus six percentage points. First City hasconsistently said in the past that it plans to opt forredemption.   Mr. Abboud said First City, through its investment banker,Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities Corp., has begunexploratory talks with several major banks about raising themoney needed to redeem the preferred stock. He added thatmarket conditions appear to be such that any new investorwould likely demand a common equity position in First City inaddition to any debt issue it might buy. He said the equitymight take the form of warrants or some other issueconvertible into common stock.   The convertible preferred stock translates into 4.5million shares of common stock. First City currently has 18.2million shares outstanding.   Mr. Abboud said he believes First City would make anattractive partner because of its strong Texas franchise andbecause he and other top officials have a great deal ofexperience in international banking and in the oil business.Mr. Abboud formerly served as chairman and chief executive ofFirst Chicago Corp. and president and chief operating officerof Occidental Petroleum Corp., Los Angeles.   He added that he has some leverage over how thetransaction proceeds. &quot;The fact is I like this franchise. Ilike being here and I have a big slug of stock. We're in theunique position of controlling our destiny.&quot;   People familiar with First City's plans say neitherBankAmerica nor Bank of New York is likely to be big enoughon its own to complete the sort of deal Mr. Abboud seeks.   BankAmerica of San Francisco, with about $104 billion inassets, is the second largest U.S. bank holding company,after New York-based Citicorp. But on the world stage itranks around 50th, according to statistics compiled by theAmerican Banker, a trade publication, far behind the mammothJapanese and European banks that have come to dominate globalbanking.   New York-based Bank of New York's $49 billion in assetsrank it 13th in the U.S. and around 98th world-wide. And itsability to make an investment in First City is suspect. Justlast month the Federal Reserve Board blocked a proposedmerger with Northeast Bancorp of New Haven, Conn., rulingthat such a move would harm Bank of New York's &quot;ability tomaintain a strong capital position.&quot;   Some banking sources suggested such constraints could leadFirst City beyond U.S. borders in search of well-capitalizedpartners. &quot;It's hard to do&quot; given the depressed share pricesand thin capital bases of most U.S. banks, said oneinvestment banker.</TEXT></DOC>
