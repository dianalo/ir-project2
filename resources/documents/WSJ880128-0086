The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. provided $900,000 to help keep open Citizens State Bank of Hayfield, Minn., which was in danger of failure. Investors agreed to provide another $1.8 million of additional capital for the bank, which has assets of $30.1 million.    Meanwhile, First Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Freeport, Ill., with assets of $31.1 million, was acquired by Home Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Rockford, Ill. First Federal's two offices will open today as branches of Home Federal.    The Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. will contribute about $12.2 million in cash and other loss protections totaling about $1.8 million to the acquiring thrift. Home Federal has $310.1 million in assets and eight offices in northwest Illinois.    The actions were the first thrift rescue and the 13th bank assistance or liquidation by federal insurers this year. </TEXT></DOC>
