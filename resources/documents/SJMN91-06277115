Ranstrom, director of litigation for Legal Services of NorthernCalifornia, called the ruling a &quot;major step forward&quot; for her clients.;  District attorneys' offices in the state collect support payments from absentparents and make disbursements to parents who have custody of children.Currently they provide an accounting of collections to the custody parentsonce a year.;   &quot;The judge obviously felt that the notices were notsufficient, and he wants something done on that,&quot; Ranstrom said Wednesday.&quot;The DAs who are collecting this money, for whatever reason, aren't doing agood job. Unless the custodial parent stays on top of this, they just don'tget their money.&quot;;   Yet Ranstrom acknowledged that because Shubb did notspecify how frequently the accounting notices must be issued, nor what type ofinformation they must contain, the effect of his order is hard to gauge. &quot;Alot of it is still very fluid,&quot; she said.;   A lawyer for the state Departmentof Social Services, which is responsible for correcting errors and delays incollecting child-support payments, doubted the ruling would have much of animpact.;   &quot;There are always going to be absent parents out there who will notpay, regardless of whether you have monthly or daily notice,&quot; said EileenGray, a deputy state attorney general.;   Gray said she did not yet know whattype of notification schedule the department would propose to comply withShubb's order.;   State officials say that about 1 million women in Californiaare supposed to be receiving child-support payments, but more than 300,000 ofthem are not collecting the full amount ordered.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  McClatchy News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Sacramento  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911003  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  326  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 3, 199100277115,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
