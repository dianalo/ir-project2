Among those criminal conspiracies was the fraudulent acquisition of Columbia Federal Savings Bank of Westport, Conn. In a civil lawsuit filed last week in Bridgeport, Conn., the FSLIC asked a federal judge to order Mr. Galanis and other defendants to divest themselves of their stock in the thrift.    The stock was purchased in 1982 and 1985 by six individuals with funds provided by Mr. Galanis, according to the lawsuit. The thrift later lent at least $10 million to various enterprises directed by Mr. Galanis, including companies that offered fraudulent tax shelters to investors.    Three of the stock purchasers subsequently pleaded guilty to criminal charges and agreed to cooperate in the investigation that led to Mr. Galanis's indictment in May 1987. In July 1988, a jury in federal court in White Plains, N.Y., convicted Mr. Galanis of 44 charges, including conspiracy and securities fraud in the takeover of Columbia Federal.    Mr. Galanis will remain free on a $20 million bond, secured by real estate and personal property, pending an appeal of his conviction. Assistant U.S. Attorney Vincent Briccetti said yesterday that he is considering appealing Mr. Galanis's release on bond. </TEXT></DOC>
