Japan's Kyodo news service said 200,000 people, including manygovernment officials and merchants, took part in demonstrationsthat virtually shut down the city of 3.5 million people.   Protest leaders called for a Friday rally in Rangoon to pressfor an end to one-party rule in the isolated Southeast Asian nation.   State-run Radio Rangoon, monitored in Bangkok, said PresidentMaung Maung signed a decree lifting martial law, which was slappedon Rangoon Aug. 3 following anti-government demonstrations. Theorder took effect at 1 p.m.   An order signed by Brig. Gen. Myo Nyunt, the Rangoon areacommander, withdrew the military administration from the capital anhour earlier, the radio said.   A second presidential decree lifted martial law in the town ofProme, about 150 miles north of Rangoon, Radio Rangoon said.Martial law was imposed there July 22 after mobs destroyed housesand shops.   Demonstrators led by students and saffron-robed Buddhist monksgathered in the morning outside Rangoon General Hospital, diplomatsand media accounts said. The hospital has been the main rallyingsite since troops shot medical personnel there earlier this month.   Kyodo said some protesters drove cars through the city andcalled on people to join the peaceful rally and march. They shouted``Down with Dictatorship!'' and ``We only need Democracy!'' Kyodosaid.   Many shops were shuttered, the agency said. No violence wasreported.   Hundreds of thousands of people across Burma took to the streetsfrom Aug. 8 to Aug. 12 to protest the transfer of power fromstrongman Ne Win to hard-liner Sein Lwin, widely hated in Burma forruthlessly suppressing dissent.   Clashes with security forces left, by official count, 112 peopledead and 267 wounded in Rangoon alone. But diplomats say hundredsof people may have died in the protests before Sein Lwin'sresignation Aug. 12 after just 17 days in power.   Amnesty International charged Tuesday that Burmese troops killedat least 1,000 demonstrators during the unrest. Citing reliablereports, the human rights organizaton said soldiers killed up to3,000 demonstrators, mostly unarmed and peaceful.   Soldiers repeatedly fired into unarmed peaceful crowds and atprotesters who turned violent when the student-led unrest peaked,Amnesty said in a report out of Geneva.   Students have mounted demonstrations in Rangoon almost dailysince they spearheaded the rioting that led to Sein Lwin'sresignation.   On Tuesday night, the government acknowledged the most recentprotests for the first time.   The broadcast monitored in Bangkok said security forces inMoulmein, 45 miles southeast of Rangoon, fired on demonstrators whodrove four vehicles at them Monday night. It did not say if anyonewas injured.   The report said demonstrators also looted and destroyed acustoms warehouse there Tuesday, sank a motorboat and fled with theagents' weapons. Sunday night, protesters destroyed a governmentbuilding in Sandoway, 95 miles northwest of Rangoon.   It also reported demonstrations in Rangoon, the northern city ofMandalay, and Meiktila south of Mandalay, but gave no crowdestimates. Kyodo said about 200,000 people demonstrated inMandalay, the country's second-largest city.   Maung Maung, 63, is Burma's first civilian leader since Ne Win's1962 military coup replaced democracy with rigid socialistone-party rule.   The new government has freed more than 600 people arrestedduring the earlier rioting. But several prominent figures roundedup last month in Rangoon still are held. They include Aung Gyi,Burma's leading dissident, and Sein Win, the Burma correspondent ofThe Associated Press.   An Asian diplomat said today the daughter of slain Gen. AungSan, a leader in the struggle for independence from Britain, calledfor a united front against the government and a rally of 1 millionpeople Friday to demand full democracy.   The daughter, Aung San Suu Kyi, lives in Cambridge, England butis visiting her mother in Rangoon. The diplomat, speaking oncondition of anonymity, said the rally was planned for an athleticfield in Rangoon. He did not elaborate.</TEXT></DOC>
