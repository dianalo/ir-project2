A commentary in the official Communist Party newspaper RodongShinmun did not directly mention the fall of the hard-linedictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu in Romania or other changes inEastern Europe, although it blamed ``imperialists'' for what itcalled a ``scheme to make the most of changes in political andeconomic life in some socialist countries.''   China and Cuba were the only countries identified in the report.   North Korea is ruled by a hard-line Communist leadership headedby Kim Il Sung, who, like Ceausescu, built a strong personalitycult.   The commentary, broadcast in part by Pyongyang's official KoreanCentral News Agency, said the U.S. ``imperialists'' were tryingmilitary threats, blackmail, political and diplomatic pressure andan economic blockade against Cuba.   ``They are also continuing a vicious and shameless interferencein the internal affairs of China, displeased at the fact that theChinese people keep to the road of socialism ... after quelling thecounterrevolutionary riot'' _ a reference to China's June 3-4military crackdown of a student-led pro-democracy movement.   Rodong Shinmun said ``imperialists'' claim that ``some socialistcountries should be given `assistance' needed for leading some oftheir policies to the capitalist market economy. They scheme to winover and bring under their control socialist countries, declaringthat they would render economic `aid' to somer country and treatsome other country as `most favored nation.'''   They slander socialism in the media, seek to ``infiltrate thecorrupt bourgeois ideology, culture and way of life into socialistcountries,'' and send in spies and saboteurs, the paper said.   ``The situation makes it incumbent upon all socialist countriesand the anti-imperialist independent forces to heighten vigilanceover the vicious and crafty anti-socialist moves and reactionaryoffensive of the imperialists and pool their strength to repulsethem,'' it added.</TEXT></DOC>
