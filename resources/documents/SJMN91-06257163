At sundown the little guys get cold and swarm over thestill-warm asphalt trail to take off the chill, Hayes said.;   The midge is arelative of the mosquito but it feeds on plant fluid instead of blood. It isharmless and is food for birds, spiders and, occasionally and accidentally,humans.;   And midges are no dummies. After the asphalt cools off, the littlecritters head to nearby lampposts where the electric lights keep them toastyuntil the sun comes back.; DON'T DRINK THE WATER: Speaking of Lake Elizabeth,you may have noticed the signs closing it to windsurfers. That's because thebacteria level is high. The drought and a host of visiting birds are theculprits. The resident population of about 600 waterfowl zooms to nearly 3,000with the arrival of the wintering visitors. The fowls foul the water with abacteria commonly found in the digestive systems of animals and humans. If itgets in your stomach, you could have an upset stomach or worse.;   Ranger JudyFelber said the lake is usually closed for water contact sports this time ofyear until spring, when rain brings fresh water and the migrating geese andducks leave.;   While the lake is off-limits to windsurfers, it's still OK totake a boat on the water and to fish. But don't drink the water.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Dennis Rockstroh column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/Am  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910913  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  298  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday, September 13, 199100257163,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
