Jane Kahn, mother of Atlanta '88 Committee President Bobby Kahn,said she and her husband probably would wind up, like so manyothers, watching the convention in the special VIP room at thenearby Georgia World Congress Center.   Bobby Kahn, 30, was executive director of the Georgia DemocraticParty when efforts began to bring the 1988 convention to Atlanta.He headed the successful drive, then moved to the Atlanta '88corporation that was set up to manage preparations.   ``He told us we can't get on the floor during the convention,''Mrs. Kahn, of Savannah, said a little wistfully. ``There are toomany requests, and he'll bend over backwards not to show favoritism.   ``I may get to be an elector if Michael Dukakis wins in Georgia.But, when Bobby brought me the papers to sign for that, he told meit still wouldn't get us on the convention floor.''</TEXT></DOC>
