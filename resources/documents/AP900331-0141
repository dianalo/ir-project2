ChavalitYongchaiyudh became deputy prime minister and defense ministerFriday in a controversial move that students and critics called asetback for Thai democracy.   Chavalit took up the new posts under a command issued by thecountry's constitutional monarch, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, saidstate Radio Thailand, monitored in Bangkok.   Chavalit retired Tuesday as army commander in chief. He wasoffered the Cabinet posts by Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan,who hopes Chavalit will help shore up a government destablized byallegations of corruption, inefficiency and labor disputes.   Chatichai yielded his defense ministry portfolio to Chavalit,who also is now one of four deputy prime ministers.   Radio Thailand said the deputy army chief, Gen. SuchindaKraprayoon, is the new army chief while the armed forces chief ofstaff, Gen. Sunthorn Kongsompong, takes on the post of actingsupreme commander.   Thailand has a long tradition of generals dominating politics,but hopes for a new course were raised after Chatichai in August1988 became the first prime minister in 12 years to also be anelected official.   Chavalit's moves to join the Cabinet prompted the StudentsFederation of Thailand to renew calls for a constitutionalamendment requiring all ministers to be elected members of theParliament.   Members of the federation staged a protest outside GovernmentHouse Thursday, holding up banners that called Chavalit a``destroyer of democratic culture'' and chastized him for ``jumpingthe queue'' to political power.   The Thai media usually is timid in criticizing the military, butThe Nation, an independent English-language newspaper, stated itsviews in a hard-hitting open letter to Chavalit published Thursday.   It said: ``Many people are suspicious of your motives. Is thisyour short cut to political power? ...   ``Your going straight into the government will imply that eithera top army commander can always demand a seat of political poweralmost at will, or that an elected civilian government cannotsurvive without the support of the military, or both. Neither ofthese bodes well for the political future of Thailand.''   Chavalit was appointed army chief in 1986 when the then-primeminister, Prem Tinsulanonda, fired Gen. Arthit Kamlang-ek forpublicly challenging the government.</TEXT></DOC>
