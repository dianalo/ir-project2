Col. William R.Higgins.   It said Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid had revealed the names ofHiggins' captors, who reported they hanged the U.S. Marine officerMonday.   An army spokesman said: ``From first evidence from a continuinginvestigation of Obeid and according to his confessions in theinvestigation, it was revealed that the sheik was personallyinvolved in planning and guiding and aiding the following terroristacts:   ``The kidnapping of two Israeli army soldiers, Rachamim Alsheikhand Yosef Fink in February 1986; carrying out terror acts againstIsraeli forces, and the kidnapping of Col. Higgins and his transferto Beirut and the hiding of his kidnappers in his home in Jibchit.''   During the investigation, Obeid ``revealed the names of thekidnappers and more details on the terrorist acts of the Hezbollahorganization and its connection with Iran. The investigationcontinues,'' said the spokesman, whose name was withheld in keepingwith standing regulations.   A year-old interview was broadcast on Israel Television in whichObeid supported the kidnapping of Higgins, claiming he was a CIAagent who spied on the pro-Iranian Hezbollah. Obeid is a spiritualleader of Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God.   Avi Pazner, spokesman for Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, saidthe killing of Higgins was ``odious and criminal'' if true, butIsrael remains ready to trade prisoners for Israeli and otherhostages.   ``At this point we have no confirmation that, indeed, Col.Higgins was murdered,'' he said after Higgins' captors announcedthey hanged him Monday.   They had threatened to kill Higgins at 3 p.m. (8 a.m. EDT)unless Israel freed Obeid, who was abducted Friday. Higgins waskidnapped Feb. 17, 1988.   About an hour after the deadline, the group calling itself theOrganization of the Oppressed on Earth announced it had killedHiggins and released a videotape showing a body hanging from agallows.   ``We have to be very cautious with a possible reaction, becauseyou remember a year ago the same organization said that theyexecuted Col. Higgins after the accidental shooting down of anIranian airplane by the U.S. Navy,'' Pazner said.   ``So we will have to look for further evidence to confirmwhether such an odious and criminal act has been perpetrated.''   On Dec. 12, 1988, Higgins' captors said he had been sentenced todeath, but did not say he had been killed. A diplomatic source toldThe Associated Press the United Nations had unconfirmed reportsthat he was killed after the USS Vincennes, on duty in the PersianGulf, shot down an Iranian jetliner July 3, 1988.   Israel Television's Arab affairs analyst, Ehud Yaari, saidIsraeli and other intelligence services, and U.N. officials, hadreceived many reports recently indicating Higgins was killed inJuly 1988 or in December 1988.   The military often allows Yaari interview guerrillas captured inLebanon or at sea.   Foreign Minister Moshe Arens also reacted cautiously to reportsHiggins had been hanged.   ``We have no proof,'' he said on Israel radio. ``Thisinformation is from a fanatical organization which is not known fortelling the truth. To our great sorrow, we are well acquainted withthis organization.''   Pazner said Israel was holding open its offer to exchange itsShiite Moslem captives from Lebanon for Israeli prisoners of warand all foreign hostages held by Shiite groups.   ``The offer stands because we are aware of the precariousposition of foreign hostages in Lebanon and we are ready to do ourshare if it is possible to liberate them,'' he said.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin made the offer earlier in theday, before the reports that Higgins had been killed.   ``Israel repeats its call for the release of Israeli and otherhostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon, Rabin said. ``Israel isoffering to trade prisoners, detainees and hostages.''   ``According to this proposal, all the Israeli prisoners andforeign hostages held by Shiite groups in Lebanon would be swappedfor all the Shiite prisoners kept by Israel, including Sheik AbdulKarim Obeid, Jawad Kasfi and others,'' Rabin said.   Israel accuses Obeid of planning attacks on its forces in southLebanon. Kasfi was captured in Lebanon in December.   Security sources in Lebanon estimate 50-60 Lebanese Shiites arein Israeli prisons.   Israel's surrogate militia, the South Lebanon Army, holds about300 Shiites in a prison at Khiam in south Lebanon. The militiahelps patrol Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' just northof the border.   In offering the prisoner exchange, Rabin said including hostagesof other countries in the deal ``results from the fact that they'realso threatened by the Israeli actions.''   The 17 Westerners missing and presumed held hostage in Lebanon,all or most of them by kidnappers loyal to Iran, include Higginsand eight other Americans.</TEXT></DOC>
