California Gov. George Deukmejian asked Thursday to be withdrawnfrom consideration, and the vice president's chief of staff, CraigFuller, indicated the governor's wishes would be honored.   ``He's going to be very important to us in winning California,''Fuller said. Asked if that was the final word, Fuller said, ``Yes.''   Bush campaign aides previously had said Deukmejian was amongabout a dozen people Bush had told were under active consideration.   ``As you know, if I were to assume the vice presidency, it wouldmean turning the entire executive branch of the nation's mostpopulous state over to the Democratic Party,'' Deukmejian said inhis letter to Bush.   California's lieutenant governor and the next four officials inline for succession are Democrats.   The vice president has said he will make up his mind on arunning mate before he leaves for the Republican NationalConvention, where he will be installed formally as the GOPpresidential nominee.   However, he has vowed to keep his choice secret until late inthe four-day August 15-18 convention.   The vice president was traveling later today to his familyvacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, where he was to spend theweekend.   All five of Bush's adult children and many of his grandchildrenwere to be with him for the making of campaign films that willfocus on Bush's family life, aides said.   However, Bush delayed his departure until later today, possiblyfor the long-expected announcement that Treasury Secretary James A.Baker III will resign his post to take over as Bush's campaignchairman.   Bush aides Thursday confimed that such an announcement wasimminent. There has been wide speculation that Baker would make theannouncement today at the close of financial markets.   President Reagan is expected to name New York investment bankerNicholas Brady _ a close friend of Bush's _ to fill out the rest ofBaker's term.   Bush told reporters on Air Force 2 that he also will be workingon his convention acceptance speech in the days ahead.   ``We're going to go over the left field fence'' with the speech,Bush said.   Bush, who has been focusing on defense and foreign policy issuesall week, told a Hispanic veterans group in Corpus Christi, Texas,on Thursday that foreign policy stands taken by Dukakis, theDemocratic presidential nominee, would amount to ``unilateraldisarmament.''   ``All my experience tells me that the governor of Massachusetts'views, if implemented, would make the world not a safer place, butmore dangerous,'' he told the G.I. Forum.   He said Dukakis had ``veered far outside the mainstream''bipartisan consensus formed after World War II to confrontcommunist threats to ``free people'' worldwide.   ``His positions ... amount to a rejection of America's role as aworld leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine and thevision of John Kennedy,'' Bush said.   He cited Dukakis' support for a nuclear freeze and opposition toadvanced weapons systems favored by the Reagan administration.   Bush said the Democratic platform is ``no help'' in trying todetermine where the Democratic presidential nominee stood onforeign-policy issues.   ``The Democratic platform is the black hole of Americanpolitics,'' Bush said. ``Issues get sucked into it and lost, neverto reappear again.''   After leaving Corpus Christi, Bush made an unscheduled visit toChicago to attend a wake for Aloysius Mazewski, who had beenpresident of the National Polish Alliance.   Majewski, whom Bush described as a friend of long standing and``a great Polish-American leader,'' died Wednesday of a heartattack.</TEXT></DOC>
