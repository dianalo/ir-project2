SullivanandM;The New York branch of a Dutch bank has tapped a new image-processing systemfrom DataImage Inc. to clean out its archive of microfilm and streamline itstransaction processing.andM;The new Optical Archival and Retrieval System (OARS), a software and hardwarepackage that DataImage will officially begin shipping this month, allows NMBBank to maintain a history of funds transactions on-line worldwide.andP;  Theimaging system has been in use for the past month at the New York office,which now stores its records on optical media, said Gareth Stenner, chiefoperating officer at DataImage in Glastonbury, Conn.andM;By September, the use of OARS at NMB Bank will eliminate the need for bankrecords to be stored on microfilm, said Jon Peterson, vice president andsystems manager of the bank.andP;  With the old system, he said, &quot;if people neededsomething from six months ago, they would have to go and call a roll ofmicrofilm.andP;  Now, they can do the retrieval right off the PC.&quot;andM;NMB Bank spent about $300,000 on the OARS software and a 325-gigabyte OARSjukebox, which it added to its existing Tandem Computers Inc. mainframe andPS/2-based Token-Ring LAN running Novell NetWare.andP;  The system will quicklypay for itself by cutting down on employees' time spent archiving andretrieving information, said Peterson.andM;OARS is targeted at large banks such as NMB because it supports the archivingof communications and transactions conducted on the Tandem mainframes, whichare common in the banking industry, and networked PCs, said Stenner.andP;  Thesystem indexes information and provides on-line access to processedinformation that otherwise would be stored on microfiche or microfilm.andM;&quot;OARS allows banks to take their daily reports and archive them out to anoptical-storage facility,&quot; said Stenner.andP;  Information can then be rapidlyretrieved and viewed by several people simultaneously, he said.andM;OARS works with the three most widely used Tandem-based funds-transfersystems -- BESS from Data Architects, Internet from Internet Systems Corp.andO;and Moneynet from Applied Communications Inc., according to Stenner.andM;OARS' software components include an optical archival and retrieval programthat runs in both the Tandem and DOS-based PC environments, providing theability to archive, store and retrieve computer-generated reports; Softview,which displays images in a Microsoft Windows environment on a PC; theTransaction Delivery System, which establishes multiple sessions between thePC and Tandem host; and a Dynamic SQL interface, which stores indexinginformation in the Tandem NonStop SQL database.andM;A basic OARS system for a Tandem CLX series mainframe costs $70,000.andP;  A6.5-gigabyte WORM-based Optical Storage Facility jukebox is $50,000 and a325-gigabyte model is $160,000.andM;DataImage can be contacted at (203) 659-3980.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
