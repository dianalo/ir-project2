(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A jury was selected Thursday in the trialof two former aides to PTL founder Jim Bakker after a day thatincluded such questions as whether they recognized Jaguar, Cartierand other luxury brand names.   David Taggart, 32, and his older brother and housemate, James,35, are accused of not paying $494,000 in income taxes from 1983 to1987. They also are charged with using more than $1.1 million of PTLmoney to pay personal bills, including $55,000 in purchases from theCartier jewelry store in New York.   A jury of eight women and four men was selected to hear theTaggarts' trial, which is scheduled to begin July 5 and is expectedto take about a month. Four alternate jurors also were picked.   The Taggarts' trial will be a prelude to the August trial ofBakker and Richard Dortch. The two former PTL leaders are accused ofdiverting more than $4 million in PTL money for their own benefit.   David Taggart went to work at PTL in 1978 when he was 21 as anadministrative assistant to the television ministry's musicdirector. The young piano player soon became Bakker's most trustedaide, and perhaps PTL's second most powerful executive.   David Taggart, according to PTL records, drew more than $620,000in pay in the 15 months ending March 1987 _ the same month Bakkerresigned in a sex and money scandal. James Taggart _ then PTL'sinterior decorator _ received nearly $300,000 during that period.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter asked some potential jurors ifthey regularly contributed to a church or a religious organization.He also asked if they were familiar with certain brand names such asGucci, Jaguar, Cartier and Mercedes Benz. He then asked if they buymost of their clothing and jewelry in discount stores or expensiveshops and if they normally pay with cash, credit cards or checks.   It was not known whether any prospective jurors were excluded onthe basis of their answers to the questions.   The Taggarts' wardrobes included mink coats, designer clothes andexpensive jewelry. They bought a $660,000 condominium on New York'sFifth Avenue and a $317,000 two-story stucco house in southeastCharlotte.   For Christmas in 1986, they gave each other black Jaguar carsworth $87,765.   Federal prosecutors are trying to prove the Taggarts conspired todefraud the IRS by using PTL credit cards to get cash advances,ranging from $5,000 to $25,000, and then using the money to paypersonal bills.   The Taggarts also are accused of using blank PTL checks to payoff their American Express bills. One check was for $50,000, anotherfor $45,000, the indictment said.</TEXT></DOC>
