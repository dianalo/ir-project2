<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-59-0966 </DOCNO><TEXT>Using sum rules techniques to calculate the radiative pion capture rate{Lambda}/sub {gamma}//sup {pi}/(nl) and the muon capture rate {Lambda}/sub{mu}/, two results are obtained. First, the ratio {Lambda}/sub {gamma}//sup{pi}/(nl) over the experimental absorption width {Gamma}/sub n//sub l//sup{pi}/ is independent of the nl atomic level from which the pion is capturedin each nucleus. Second, we explain the empirical observation that theradiative ratio scaled with the width {Gamma}{sub 1}/sub s//sup {pi}/is nearly equal to {Lambda}/sub {mu}/ multiplied by 2.33 x 10/sup 12/.This constant is basically determined by coupling constants and masses.</TEXT></DOC>
