The results of MRI were compared with those of the concurrentX-ray computed tomography (CT), angiography (AG), and ultrasonography.Thirty-five were hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC), 8 metastatic tumors,9 hemangiomas (HG), 2 hepatic abscesses, and 2 hepatic cysts. Significantdifferences in T1 values were observed not only among the masses butalso between masses and either normal tissues or liver cirrhosis. Therewas, however, no significant difference in T1 values between normal tissuesand liver cirrhosis. While MRI was inferior to X-ray CT and AG in detectingHCC, it was slightly superior to X-ray CT in detecting portal invasionof HCC. In the diagnosis of HG, MRI surpassed the other three madalities.In conclusion, MRI may be of great value in the differential diagnosisof hepatic masses. (Namekawa, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
