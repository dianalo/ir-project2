The decision makes it possible for U.S., West European and Japanese suppliers to ship International Business Machines Corp.'s AT computers and other models of equivalent power to the Soviet bloc without prior authorization. The panel, called the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, voted to relax restrictions on the shipments effective Aug. 15.    The panel action came a week after the Commerce Department announced that it is relieving U.S. exporters of licensing requirements for these products. In effect, the panel is extending the same privilege to traders in the 16 other countries that make up the group.    The ruling covers computers with a data-processing rate of up to 68 million bits of information a second and four megabytes of memory. Among the models that fall in this class are IBM's PS/2 Model 30 and Apple Computer Inc.'s MacIntosh Plus. The U.S. decided to abandon controls on these products because they are widely available in many countries outside Cocom. </TEXT></DOC>
