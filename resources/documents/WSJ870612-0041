In Manhattan federal court yesterday, Keith McDermott, 48 years old, was charged with one count of conspiracy and one count of aiding the receipt of kickbacks by a &quot;co-conspirator at Morgan.&quot; The indictment cites seven alleged transactions, with more than $500,000 in alleged kickbacks, relating to work done for two Morgan clients.    The indictment identified the other officer only as a &quot;senior vice president at Morgan between June 10, 1981, and Aug. 30, 1985.&quot; Yesterday, a spokesman for J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., the bank's parent, confirmed that the other official is Mr. Gebauer. &quot;We're of course saddened that criminal charges have been brought against a former Morgan officer, charges that further involve Antonio Gebauer,&quot; the spokesman, John M. Morris, said.    Prosecutors handling the case couldn't be reached late yesterday.    Mr. Morris added: &quot;Our investigation of Mr. Gebauer's activities thoroughly covered records available to us; it clearly indicated the illegal actions to which he pleaded guilty but also raised certain questions about activities not reflected in our records and beyond the powers of a private investigation to discover. Those questions, which were part of our report to the U.S. Attorney and banking regulators, have been the subject of further investigation by the authorities and resulted in this indictment.&quot;    The indictment doesn't name any other Morgan officers. Mr. Morris said the bank believes that Mr. McDermott's indictment &quot;closes the case.&quot;    Mr. Gebauer, who left Morgan in August 1985, is currently serving a 3 1/2-year prison term for misappropriating the $4.3 million from Brazilian customer accounts.    Reached at his home in Greenwich, Conn., Mr. McDermott referred all questions to his attorney, Jed S. Rakoff. Mr. Rakoff couldn't be reached for comment last night at his Manhattan office.    An attorney for Mr. Gebauer, Stanley S. Arkin, declined to comment on any connection his client may have to the McDermott case.    Mr. McDermott is scheduled to be arraigned next Thursday. U.S. Attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani said in a statement that Morgan Guaranty &quot;cooperated fully&quot; in the government's investigation.    The two clients in the McDermott case are identified only as being involved in the &quot;production and sale of coffee&quot; and the &quot;equipment business.&quot; According to the indictment, Morgan assisted the coffee company in a financial restructuring from July 1979 to March 1982. Mr. Morris declined to identify the companies.    The indictment outlines two alleged conspiracies: one when Mr. McDermott was working at Morgan and one when he became an outside consultant after leaving the bank in 1982.    All told, Mr. McDermott allegedly received $212,425, most of it through inflated fees allegedly paid by Morgan to an unidentified &quot;consultant&quot; in connection with financial work Morgan did for the two clients.    That consultant subsequently divided the extra money between Mr. McDermott and the Morgan co-conspirator, according to the indictment. Mr. McDermott also was charged, among other things, with aiding the co-conspirator in accepting a payment of $56,250 for processing a loan for the coffee company from Morgan.    Mr. McDermott, a 17-year Morgan employee, left Morgan in April 1982 and became an outside consultant for Morgan on matters related to the equipment company -- allegedly paying the Morgan co-conspirator half of his initial $6,000 retainer fee as well as subsequent payments.    The co-conspirator received about $300,000 altogether in the alleged schemes, according to the indictment. Morgan was &quot;unaware&quot; of all the payments, the government said.    Mr. McDermott, if convicted, faces a maximum five years in prison and a $10,000 fine on a felony count of conspiracy and one year in jail and a $1,000 fine on a misdemeanor of &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the co-conspirator. </TEXT></DOC>
