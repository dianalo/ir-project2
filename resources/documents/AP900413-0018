By introducing its bill this week, the VA also is moving theBush administration closer to embracing competitive pay for allgovernment employees.   Federal agencies have been looking at competitive or localitypay as a means of recruiting and keeping workers.   Competitive pay bases salaries on current rates paid in acommunity for comparable positions. The federal Office of PersonnelManagement has proposed a system that includes adjustments forlocal pay but also, for certain employees, links pay raises to jobperformance.   The House and Senate Veterans Affairs committees have separateproposals for raising nursing pay as well.   Under the new bill, a VA hospital, nursing home or otherfacility would be able to use pay data from non-VA facilities in anarea to establish ``community rates.'' The community rates would bepaid only if those local rates exceed the national pay scale for VAnurses.   The VA employs 35,000 registered nurses at its hospitals,clinics and nursing homes, making it the largest such employer inthe country.   The nationally set base pay for a VA registered nurse is$18,174. The American Nurses Association says the national averagestarting pay for a registered nurse is $25,261.   The VA already has been able to adjust pay to meet local rates,but the process is so slow that the agency's salary levels stillfall behind those of private employers.   The department was paying special rates at 130 of its 172medical centers a year ago, Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward J.Derwinski said in a letter accompanying his legislative proposal.   ``Even with the special rates, VA has not been able to offercompetitive salaries at certain geographic locations'' such asBoston, Southern California and New York City, Derwinski said.</TEXT></DOC>
