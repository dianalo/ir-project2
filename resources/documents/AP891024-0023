Hector Castaneda Jimenez, chief prosecutor at the AttorneyGeneral's Office, said Monday that an estimated $82.8 million ingovernment property and unpaid taxes have been recovered in the11-month campaign to root out official corruption.   As part of the campaign, Castaneda's office will issue warrantsduring the next six months for the arrest of another 10,000 federalemployees suspected of illegally gaining an estimated $376.8million, the prosecutor was quoted as saying by the independentnews service Excelsior.   ``It is a difficult job, but not impossible,'' Castaneda said,and federal agents hope to recover at least half that amount. ``Therest will probably not be recoverable either because the status oflimitations expired or because many prefer to spend additional timein jail rather than return the money.''   Salinas took office Dec. 1 for a six-year term.</TEXT></DOC>
