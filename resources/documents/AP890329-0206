But a year later, the spirit of the ``Deaf President Now''protest lives on _ in newfound pride and assertiveness among thedeaf, in heightened awareness and understanding among the hearing.   ``The euphoria is still here. The energy is still here,'' saidI. King Jordan, Gallaudet's president. ``The sense of purpose, thesense of community _ it's better than it was ever before. It getsbetter all the time. Something fundamental has changed in thebeliefs that deaf people have about themselves and that hearingpeople have about deaf people.''   Jordan won his post March 13, 1988, after students, joined byfaculty, staff and alumni, shut down the 125-year-old school forfive days and forced the board of trustees' initial choice toresign. She was Elisabeth Ann Zinser, a hearing woman who did notknow sign language; she was gone within a week.   Lofty pronouncements emanated by the dozens from protestersriding the exhilarating crest of victory last spring. ``God madethe world in seven days and we have changed it in seven days,''deaf chemistry professor Charles Giansanti said then. Nothing willever be the same, said countless others.   Visionaries or fools? The developments of the past year point tothe former.   Enrollment at the 2,400-student university is up 52 percent.Congress, which provides most of the Gallaudet budget, boosted itscontribution 6.2 percent. The two congressmen on the Gallaudetboard are learning to sign. The new deaf chairman of the boarddeveloped a plan to recruit deaf board members. Jordan, in constantdemand to speak, has become an inspirational symbol revered by deafpeople all over the country.   Perhaps the most fundamental change is a shift in attitude.   ``People have developed a lot more confidence in themselves,''said Greg Hlibok, student body president and part of the intensequartet that led the insurgency. ``Their pride has increased. Theirview of the future _ they look forward to much more than people didfive years ago. There's a wider range of perspective.''   Off campus, the story is similar. ``More people are aware ofdeafness,'' Hlibok said through an interpreter. ``Before, theylooked at us as a problem. Today, they look at us as people with aproblem _ deafness. That's all.''   The board chairman, IBM executive Philip Bravin, saidGallaudet's week in the limelight was enough to propel much of theprivate sector from discomfort to openness toward the deaf.   Referring to his and Jordan's speaking engagements around thecountry, Bravin, who also won his job as a result of theinsurgency, said that ``countless times we have run into peoplesaying that their job or working conditions changed for the betterovernight as a result of DPN (the Deaf President Now movement).That's a very positive thing to hear. It's not limited (to a fewcorporations) but (is) very global.''   Again and again, one is told of students landing jobs they werenever able to get before _ whether because of their own insecurityor an employer's intolerance.   One girl, told that a pizza delivery job had been filled, passedby the store next day and saw the ``help wanted'' sign again in thewindow. She confronted the supervisor and got the job. ``She feltthat empowerment that a year ago she might not have felt,'' saidJordan.   Since the protest, students have ``a general attitude of `I canwin, I can succeed, I can achieve what I want,''' said careercenter director Sue Pressman. At the same time, she said, employershave become more receptive to hiring deaf graduates and many morecompanies are participating in Gallaudet career fairs.   ``You do still find a lot of attitudinal barriers,'' she said.``But the deaf protest allowed us to go in and work with thosepeople. Employers are looking to Gallaudet for the answers. They'rewilling (to hire deaf people). They want us to help them. They'relooking to us to show them the way.''   The same heightened interest is evident in Gallaudet'sinternship program, which has expanded rapidly since the protest.``The one big thing is (that) we have name recognition now. Wenever had that before with private companies, and it's an importantentree,'' said program director Anne Nissen.   Nissen said she used to have to give a long explanation ofGallaudet, often with little to show for it.   ``People were always courteous, because you're not rude topeople who are explaining a disability, but they didn't followup,'' she said. ``Now there's a lot of curiosity and eagerness tobe attached to a famous place. We have milked that.''   New participants in the internship program include Sears,Roebuck and Co.; Saks Fifth Avenue; Northern Telecom; MCICommunications Corp.; ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories, and several Big Eightaccounting firms. Students are doing more challenging work, Nissensaid, and are more likely to complain promptly if a job turns outto be busywork.   Students say they're being treated better not only on the jobbut in other aspects of daily life as well. ``When I used to go toa restaurant and ask for paper and pen to order some food, peopletended to have a negative attitude,'' said Hlibok. ``Now there's awillingness. They're eager to help.''   The other big change, the four protest leaders said through aninterpreter, is that the nation's deaf community no longer sits onits hands when its interests are at stake. ``This was our firstmovement,'' said Jerry Covell. ``Deaf people now feel that we'reentitled to our opinion.''   Tim Rarus recalled his doubts in organizing a Capitol Hill rallyto demand telecommunications devices for the deaf on phones atfederal agencies. ``I thought, deaf people aren't going to showup,'' he said. ``But they did. We got a good crowd.''   Hlibok said another successful rally was held in New York toprotest threatened budget cuts for state schools for the deaf.``There's an unwritten rule since the protest'' at Gallaudet.``When something happens that's a crisis in the deaf community,deaf people are going to act,'' he said.   ``That didn't happen before the protest. We asked ourselves,`Should we or shouldn't we?' But, now, if something's wrong, we'regoing to speak out right away.''   Hlibok, Rarus, Covell and Bridgetta Bourne all said they plan toattend law school in the next few years and serve the deaf ordisabled community in some fashion. They are acutely conscious oftheir legacy _ not only to the school, but to the larger deafcommunity as well.   ``We made history,'' Covell said simply. ``Now small deafchildren will look to that and will learn something from it. Wewere oppressed and finally we said, `Enough.' They will do betterthan we did. They'll continue what we haven't finished.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
