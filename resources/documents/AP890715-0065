Officials fired the publisher of a pro-Beijing newspaper in HongKong that had criticized the military assault on pro-democracyprotesters in Beijing. The Communist government, acting through itsofficial Xinhua News Agency, dismissed publisher Lee Tze-chung onSaturday. Lee said he would fight to stay at the Wen Wei Ponewspaper.   Staff at hotels catering to foreign tourists in Beijing saidofficials appeared without notice Friday and Saturday and removedall foreign periodicals from bookracks.   They were told there would be no further sales of Time, Newsweek,the Asian Wall Street Journal, the Far Eastern Economic Review andthe International Herald Tribune, which have given in-depth coverageto China's crushing of the student-led movement.   ``We were very surprised. They came so suddenly,'' said a stafferat the Jinglun Hotel.   ``We're just going backward again,'' said an executive at theJianguo Hotel, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said most ofthe hotel's visitors are businessmen who follow world events andsaid ``already people are complaining'' about being cut off fromaccess to the news.   The hotels said the China National Import and Export Corp. wouldnot give a reason for the raid or say how long the halt in saleswould continue.   Foreign travelers arriving in Beijing have been told not to takenewspapers and magazines off the plane, and transmissions of theU.S.-funded Voice of America radio have been jammed since thedemocracy movement was extinguished more than a month ago.   Two VOA reporters in Beijing were among seven Western journalistsdeported for alleged rumormongering and violations of martial law.   Chinese authorities July 1 also cut off satellite transmissionsof the U.S. television network CNN to Beijing hotels.   The attempt to limit access to outside reports began shortlyafter the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy protesters andtheir supporters in central Beijing's Tiananmen Square.   Authorities said about 200 civilians, mostly ``thugs'' and``ruffians,'' were killed in the assault, but Chinese witnesses andWestern intelligence sources said the death toll may have been ashigh as 3,000.   The government asserts the use of force was necessary to stop a``counterrevolutionary rebellion'' attempting to overthrow thegovernment.   The Communist Party's new chief, Jiang Zemin, on Friday told ameeting on higher education that the nation has failed to provideadequate ideological education at a time when young people havebecome increasingly attracted to the West.   ``As a result, they are not mentally prepared to face thehardships and complexities in the socialist construction and thereform,'' the official Xinhua News Agency quoted him as saying.   Jiang, named to his post June 24 after moderate Zhao Ziyang waspurged for opposing the use of force against the students, also saidastrophysicist Fang Lizhi and Fang's supporters are ``scum of theChinese intellectuals.'' Fang, a frequent critic of the Communistgovernment, and his wife Li Shuxian have been sheltered in the U.S.Embassy in Beijing since June 4.</TEXT></DOC>
