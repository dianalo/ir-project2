Robert Butler, an engineer, recently strolled into thesprawling suburban Chicago dealership and told salesman RudyBaum that he wanted to buy a Porsche, a Saab or a BMW.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I didn't care which car he bought,&quot; says Mr. Baum, a35-year-old Porsche salesman. That's because Motor Werkssells all three brands, including the white Saab 9000 S thatMr. Butler bought. Motor Werks also sells Mercedes-Benzes,Cadillacs, Hondas, Sterlings, Suzukis and Infinitis -- all ina 110,000-square-foot building, with some competing modelssitting literally bumper to bumper.   The dealership is one of a growing number of &quot;auto malls,&quot;preplanned, multifranchise auto-sales centers. Such malls,supermarkets for cars, promise -- or threaten -- torevolutionize auto retailing. &quot;Customers want to shop wherethey're offered a broad selection,&quot; says J.C. Perkins, theGeneral Motors Corp. vice president who runs the company'sChevrolet division. &quot;There's a desire among consumers forone-stop shopping.&quot;   Motor Werks provides that by offering 10 brands, plus aused-car franchise, under one roof. Six blue-carpetedshowrooms line a wide, softly lighted hallway that itselfcontains cars on display. Customers roam freely amid the carsfrom showroom to showroom. On the other side of the hall, amammoth service department contains 48 service bays.   Currently, auto malls account for fewer than 5% of allU.S. car and truck sales. But their share will grow to 12% bythe end of the decade, says J.D. Power andamp; Co., a Californiacar-consulting concern, and to 20% within 15 years. Powerpredicts that the number of auto malls in the U.S. will riseto 350 by 2005 from about 122 now.   California is home to one-third of all auto malls,including Thousand Oaks Auto Mall and Cerritos Auto Square insuburban Los Angeles. At Thousand Oaks, 10 dealers own 38different franchises, more than at any other mall. Cerritos,with 22 franchises, has the largest sales volume -- anaverage of 3,500 cars a month. Industry analysts expect thatauto malls will continue to find their warmest reception inthe Sunbelt, where metropolitan areas are growing mostrapidly and where large parcels of land are available.   Malls are the latest step in an evolutionary process, saysPower consultant Robert Fitzharris. In the beginning of autoretailing, there were single auto dealers in isolated spots.Then, dealers began to locate closer to each other, usuallyon suburban commercial arteries, forming the ubiquitous &quot;cardealer strip&quot; in nearly every U.S. town. While many dealershave long offered two or more brands, auto malls take thatone step further by providing even more convenience forbuyers.   They also provide economies of scale for dealers, in muchthe way multiscreen movie houses do for theater owners.Dealers need the lower costs because the number of differentmodels of cars, vans and light trucks climbed by more than40% in the 1980s. That means fewer sales for individual carbrands and lower profits for the dealers selling them.   Peter Pohlman, owner of the 10-franchise Lujack Auto Plazain Davenport, Iowa, says the greatest single cost-saving itemis advertising. Lujack doesn't have 10 different ad budgets,just one. Its ads simply tell people to come to the plaza andfind their car.   What's more, Mr. Pohlman says he would need 50 employeesin addition to the 250 already on the payroll if hisfranchises operated independently. And nearly all theadditional employees would be in non-revenue-producing,administrative roles.   Paul Tamraz, owner of Motor Werks, puts it bluntly: &quot;Ihave one chief financial officer, one general sales manager,one parts and service manager, and one owner -- me. That'swhere the economies start paying off.&quot;   Whether auto malls will become dominant over time is farfrom clear, but at least some traditional dealerships havebeen hurt by them. Witness Barrington Road, where the MotorWerks mall occupies more than 30 acres. Just a block down thestreet, two empty buildings on big lots are the remains ofdealerships that sold Hondas, Cadillacs and Saabs. &quot;Theyweren't doing enough business and they wanted to sell out, soI bought them,&quot; Mr. Tamraz says.   That's one reason why not everyone in the auto industry isenthralled with malls. Another reason: The convenience toconsumers may be overstated. Malls don't include more thanone franchise of a particular brand, so buyers still mustshuttle among other dealers of that brand to haggle for thelowest price.   And auto makers worry that malls housing a dozen or morebrands won't promote their particular vehicles. That concernis especially acute for malls, such as Motor Werks, where allthe franchises are owned by one dealer instead of several.   &quot;That isn't a mall, it's just one large dealership,&quot; saysChevy's Mr. Perkins. &quot;It makes it hard to get a manager'sattention for our products.&quot; Officials at Ford Motor Co.prefer &quot;free-standing facilities that are solely dedicated toFord products,&quot; says a Ford spokesman.   But such worries don't register with consumers who thinkmalls make shopping easy -- and Mr. Butler, who recentlybought his new Saab from Motor Werks, is one. He did his dealat Motor Werks while he was between two afternoonappointments. &quot;I came here so I could compare the threedifferent cars I wanted,&quot; he says.   Auto salesmen love the concept for precisely the reasonthat manufacturers are wary. &quot;If a customer walks into myarea, I'll sell him a Honda,&quot; says Motor Werks Honda salesmanHarry Wilkinson. &quot;But if he wants a Porsche, fine. I'll walkhim down the hall and sell him a Porsche. What do I care? Asale is a sale.&quot;   Dealers reflect a similar attitude when they allot floorspace to various brands on a performance basis. Hondas arethe biggest seller at Motor Werks, and they have the biggestshowroom. Mercedes shares a showroom with Saab. Suzuki, whichonce had a separate showroom, has been relegated to thehallway, along with Sterling. Says Mr. Tamraz,matter-of-factly: &quot;This is the space they have earned.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
