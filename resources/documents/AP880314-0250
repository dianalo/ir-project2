Sofaer says he has been burned andtempered since leaving the federal bench three years ago to becomethe top lawyer at the State Department, a job that keeps him in theheat of the battle over ``Star Wars,'' the Iran-Contra affair andother controversies.   ``If it helps to go through fire, I was helped,'' said Sofaer.   Sofaer, 49, says he faces an uncertain future after PresidentReagan leaves office, and is bitter about criticism he receivedfrom lawmakers for what is called the ``broad interpretation'' ofthe Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.   His interpreration, which would have allowed Reagan toaccelerate the development and testing of missile defenses usinglasers and other exotic weapons, provoked angry outcries frommembers of Congress, who voted last year to bar the administrationfrom spending any money that would violate the ``restrictiveinterpretation.''   ``I hope that people consider me to be respectable and honorablesome day for my work,'' said Sofaer. ``But it has been very roughto be attacked the way some people have attacked me,'' he said,referring to Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the chairman of the ArmedServices Committee, and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., of the ForeignRelations Committee.''   ``Arms control is a very, very emotional subject,'' said Sofaer.``I must say I was not clued in, in a sense, so it was a shock forme to run into that degree of criticism. I feel it was very unfairand unjustified.''   He was also involved in questioning Israeli officials in thecase of Jonathan Pollard, who was sentenced to life in prison forspying for Israel, and has facilitated contacts between the Israeligovernment and the independent counsel investigating theIran-Contra affair.   Sofaer, interviewed in his office, indicated he might opposeefforts by the Iran-Contra independent counsel to subpoenatestimony from two Israelis involved in the clandestine sale ofarms to Iran, but that no final decision had been reached.   As State Department legal adviser, Sofaer heads a team of about100 lawyers, and by all accounts has a warm relationship withSecretary of State George P. Shultz.   Sofaer was born on May 6, 1938, in Bombay to a family of IraqiJews, and came to this country in 1948. After attending law school,he served as clerk to Supreme Court Associate Justice William J.Brennan in 1966-67, taught law at Columbia University from 1969-79,and was U.S. District Judge in New York from 1979-85.   Sofaer gained national prominence as trial judge in the libelcase brought by former Israeli Defense Minister Ariel Sharonagainst Time Magazine.   In an landmark verdict engineered by Sofaer, the jury found thatTime made a factual error in reporting that a secret Israeli reportsaid Sharon had discussed revenge with Lebanese officials beforemassacres in two Palestinian refugee camps. But the jury said Timeacted without malice, and was therefore not liable for monetarydamages.   ``Because of the way I handled the verdict, it turned out to bean important innovation in libel law,'' said Sofaer, who proudlypoints out a sketch of the trial scene hanging on wall of his StateDepartment office.   ``I liked being a judge very much,'' said Sofaer. ``Iparticularly liked trials.''   But, he said, ``I don't have any expectation of returning to thebench. No one has invited me. I would certainly prefer that tobeing unemployed. I don't expect to be unemployed.''   The truth is, he said, ``it's a possibility that I will have alot of time on my hands'' after Reagan leaves office.   Sofaer bridles at accusations that he devised legal rationalesfor controversial Reagan policies, such as Star Wars.   ``I have said no to several things, plans, kidnappings,abductions, intrusions into the mail of other nations. There havebeen lots of things I have opposed successfully,'' he said.   Sofaer declined to disclose details of the kidnappings andabductions he opposed, but said that none had gone forward. He didsupport the abduction of Fawaz Younis, a Lebanese suspected in thehijacking of a Royal Jordanian airliner on June 6, 1985.   Younis was seized by U.S. agents in international waters offCyprus last Sept. 13 and brought to the United States.   Of all Sofaer's actions, he probably will be remembered most forhis broad interpretation of the ABM treaty.   ``What happened was that Senator Nunn and others jumped on thisissue before we were done with all our work,'' said Sofaer. ``Thereason we weren't done with our work was because the broadinterpretation was announced long before all the work was done, andbefore any decision to implement was made.'' The interpretationnever was implemented.   Robert C. McFarlane, then the White House National Securityadviser, disclosed the broad interpretation on a television newsshow on Oct. 6, 1985.   The ensuing controversy has centered on three main issues:   _Whether the treaty barred development of space-based or mobileanti-missile weapons based on ``other physical principles''' thanthose which existed in 1972.   _Whether remarks made by U.S. officials during ratificationhearings in 1972 bound future administrations.   _ And whether the subsequent conduct of the superpowers boundthem to the restrictive interpretation.   Sofaer said he was ``not amazed'' by the outcry followingMcFarlane's revelations. ``I am not naive. I realize that thesepeople are motivated by their desire to win political battles, notto win legal arguments.''   Analysis of the ratification question had been prepared not bySofaer, but by junior attorneys on his staff, and was seized uponby SDI opponents.   ``I had said three times (the ratification analysis) wasinadequate and that I would have to come back and redo it. In fact,I was in the midst of redoing it'' when McFarlane disclosed thebroad interpretation.   Sofaer has completed his review of the ABM treaty, and sticks bythe broad interpretation, although Congress has closed the door forthe time being.   ``Now would be the time for a real debate on the ABM treaty,''he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Thu AMs, March 17</NOTE><TEXT/><NOTE>For Release Thurs AMs March 17 and thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
