Touch not a single bough!    In youth it sheltered me,   And I'll protect it now.    --George Pope Morris, 1830.    &quot;We can sit and talk about Dutch elm disease,&quot; says Prof. Gary Strobel, &quot;or we can do something about it. I chose to do something about it.&quot; As a result, Prof. Strobel, a plant pathologist at Montana State University, is in trouble with the law.    Scientists have been searching for years for a remedy to the disease that has nearly denuded the American landscape of that most American tree. They have now discovered a widely spread bacterium that can live in elm sap and produce an antibiotic that kills Dutch elm disease fungus. They have used the wonders of genetic engineering to produce a strain of the bacterium with extra antibiotic properties, and Prof. Strobel injected it into 14 elms on the Bozeman campus, thereby running afoul of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.    &quot;I must confess I don't spend a lot of time reading the Federal Register,&quot; Prof. Strobel says. Had he read the June 26, 1986, Federal Register he would have seen the EPA's 51-page Statement of Policy for microbial products, which states in part: &quot;Microorganisms formed by genetic engineering other than inter-generic combinations will be subject to the following provisions: (a) if any source is a pathogen, the resulting microbial products are subject to review under FIFRA or TSCA prior to any environmental release, except if used solely for non-pesticidal agricultural uses, in which case they are subject only to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) review (see USDA notice in this Federal Register) (b) if source organisms are not pathogens, the resulting microbial products are subject to abbreviated review under FIFRA (if they are pesticides) before any small-scale environmental release, or will be subject to the reporting requirements of sections 8 (a) and (e) of TSCA.&quot;    When a colleague warned Prof. Strobel that he had to clear his outdoor test with the EPA, he called the agency, which said approval could take several months. That effectively would have postponed the test for a year. So Prof. Strobel sent in his approval application and injected the trees with the altered bacteria. He calls what he did &quot;civil disobedience.&quot; He says, &quot;I did what I did to save a year and perhaps to draw attention to the fact that we have to be a little more careful in terms of the restrictions we impose.&quot;    It worked. Prof. Strobel is getting lots of attention. Investigations are under way by the U.S. Agriculture Department, EPA, the NIH and the National Science Foundation. Jeremy Rifkin, the Rumpelstiltskin of American science, is jumping up and down, screaming and petitioning federal agencies. The university is worried about its federal funds; the chairman of its biosafety committee wants to uproot the elm trees and burn them, under the supervision of an EPA official. We should have known that any regulatory power called the Environmental Protection Agency would some day feel compelled by the logic of its laws to burn elm trees.    With the possible exception of Mr. Rifkin, who has made a career of collecting donations by scaring people with genetic engineering, no one actually believes Prof. Strobel's bacteria is dangerous. Indeed, the National Academy of Science is about to release a major report concluding that genetic engineering poses no special dangers to mankind. Biologists have known their work was safe for some years. But American scientists, like the Montana State biosafety committee, have mostly rolled over for the Jeremy Rifkins of the world. With the notable exception of a few unafraid souls such as Harvard microbiologist Bernard Davis, they preferred to spend their energies tilting at fundamentalist windmills in Louisiana.    So Gary Strobel is guilty, guilty of doing science without first making sacrifices to propitiate the lawyers. Such a man might as well pack up and take his science to West Germany or Japan. Other American scientists -- working in biotechnology, artificial organs and other cutting-edge research -- have already taken their work overseas, fleeing the U.S.'s mania for overregulating anything it doesn't fully understand or that alarmist &quot;public-interest&quot; groups say we should be afraid of.    So what should be done with the Montana miscreant? Let's by all means have another televised Washington show trial. On one side there will be Gary Strobel, explaining his concept of scientific progress. On the other, arrayed behind mahogany desks, will sit Prof. Strobel's inquisitors -- EPA, USDA, NIH, Jeremy Rifkin, the congressman who insisted these regulations be written and the Montana State biosafety committee.    It's time to choose sides. One may either join the lawyers and the biosafety committee as they lay the torch to these trees, or one may join what few researchers are willing to step forward to save the Strobel elms -- and the self-respect of American science. </TEXT></DOC>
