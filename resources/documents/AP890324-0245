(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In an age of space shuttles andsupersonic jets, trolleys are making a comeback in America, part ofa multibillion dollar effort to reduce traffic, boost business andmake cities more civilized.   San Jose, in the high-tech world of Silicon Valley, is thelatest to install an electric trolley system and endure thediscomfort of digging up streets to lay track.   Similar light-rail systems are rolling through Buffalo, N.Y.,Sacramento, Calif., Portland, Ore., and San Diego. Systems areplanned in Fort Worth, Texas, Seattle and Los Angeles.   Though they lack the history of streetcars in New Orleans,Philadelphia and Newark, N.J., the quaint cable cars in SanFrancisco or the defunct systems in New York, Cleveland andPittsburgh, the new trolleys are quiet and reliable.   San Jose's system revives an old idea. Trolleys ran along 126miles of track throughout the Santa Clara Valley from the 1880suntil the late 1930s.   Half of Santa Clara County's new $552 million light-rail linebegan operating 15 months ago in San Jose and Santa Clara. Theother half, which will reach bedroom communities and giantInternational Business Machines Corp. in South San Jose, isexpected to be completed in August 1991, cutting a 20-mile swaththrough the county.   So far, the sleek, steel-wheeled white cars, which drawelectrical power from overhead wires via antenna-like poles, haveperformed well and generally pleased riders. Ticket machines, withinstructions in English, Vietnamese and Spanish, are easy to useand the prices are as low as 25 cents during lunchtime and 75 centsother hours.   ``I just ride for the fun of it,'' said Art Esparza, 33, whocruises through the city, between downtown San Jose and the GreatAmerica amusement park in Santa Clara, after getting off his earlymorning job. ``It's like a Sunday drive.''   The problems that have plagued the system, however, could serveas a warning to other cities considering trolleys.   A $140 million cost overrun, accidents, business disruptions,traffic jams, lawsuits, and accusations of mismanagement, briberyand embezzlement all were part of the trauma of building thelight-rail line and transit mall.   The transit mall contractor and his wife face federal taxevasion charges stemming from alleged misuse of mall funds from a$29.7 million contract with the county. The defendants have deniedthe charges.   Some of the light rail's problems were unique to San Jose, acity founded in 1777 but searching for an identity after changingfrom the center of an agricultural community to a part ofhigh-powered Silicon Valley. The city's population is closing infast on San Francisco's 740,000, but San Jose still lacks theglamor, prestige and fame of its neighbor 50 miles north.   Downtown San Jose deteriorated and the city's cohesivenesssuffered as it sprawled in different directions with new companiesand tract homes. Most fruit orchards vanished and the roads cloggedwith cars.   Voters repeatedly told pollsters over the last 10 years thattraffic was the area's worst problem. So light rail supporters soldit to the public on the promise it would reduce traffic, attractshoppers and tourists, helping the area gain a reputation asprogressive, livable community with great weather.   The only promise kept so far has been the weather.   The light-rail line is criticized by those disappointed in thelack of quick improvement in downtown business and those who wouldrather have used transportation funds for highway improvement.   ``The bitterest pill of all is the delay of constructing thefreeways for a year or two after the light rail is finished,'' saidDave Fadness, a critic of the line and chairman of the Santa ClaraCounty Transportation Commission. ``If the general public knew whatthe politicians were doing, there would be a real hue and cry.''   Ernest Glave, president of the Greater San Jose BusinessAssociation and a jeweler in the city for 41 years, also has been apersistent critic of the light rail because he thinks it doesn'thelp solve the downtown problems.   ``We've still got no attraction, nothing to draw people to,'' hesaid. He argues that the system is increasing traffic congestionrather than reducing it and is discouraging shoppers who woulddrive to the city.   Some shopkeepers, though, are doing very well. ``We've beenswamped,'' said Mario Chaidez, manager of the year-old Cobbler'sBench, a shoe repair shop. ``At lunchtime, we've got people waitingon line.''   Rod Diridon, a county supervisors who's been dubbed the ``fatherof the light rail,'' calls the line ``a resounding success,'' eventhough it cost more than three times the $176 million spent on the18-mile system that opened in Sacramento two years ago.   The 6,300 rides per day on the Santa Clara County system overthe last six months, he notes, are more than double the originalforecast by transit engineers for the first half of the line.   ``The only complaints are from the people who run red lights andrun into it,'' Diridon said.</TEXT></DOC>
