Subchapter 25, entitled ``Controland Prohibition of Air Pollution by Vehicular Fuels,'' prohibits personsfrom selling or supplying gasoline from a bulk plant or terminal havinga Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) greater than 9.0 pounds per square inch (psi)from May 1 through September 15 beginning in 1989 and continuing each yearthereafter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On November 12, 1987, the Commissioners of the Northeast States for CoordinatedAir Use Management (NESCAUM) signed a Memorandum of Understanding expressingtheir intention to reduce the RVP of gasoline to 10.0 psi starting in thesummer of 1988 and to 9.0 psi in the summer of 1989 and continuing everyozone season thereafter. Many states, including New Jersey, experienceddelays in adopting necessary regulations and did not reduce RVP to 10.0psi in the summer of 1988. New Jersey is, therefore, limiting RVP to 9.0psi from May 1 to September 15 starting in 1989, and continuing each yearthereafter. New Jersey adopted its RVP regulation on January 27, 1989 andsubmitted it to EPA as a SIP revision on the same date.EPA published a notice of final rulemaking on March 22, 1989 (54 FR 11868)which also requires the control of RVP. The EPA rule calls for the controlof the volatility of gasoline nationally. The rule requires that in theNortheast, the standard will be 10.5 psi beginning in 1989. The Federalstandard will be enforced each year beginning June 1 (for retail usersand other end users of gasoline) or May 1 (for all other points in thedistribution system) except in 1989 when enforcement will begin 100 daysand 70 days (respectively) after the publication date of the final rule.Enforcement ends at all points in the system on September 16 of each year.The EPA regulation would normally preempt the state provision under section211(c)(4) of the Clean Air Act (the Act). However, section 211(c)(4)(C)of the Act provides for approval of state control of fuel or fuel additivesif the control is part of the SIP and is necessary to achieve the primaryor secondary national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) for which theplan is in effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">Criteria for Approval</ITAG>Section 211(c)(4)(A) of the Act, in describing Federal preemption authority,states: ``Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B) or (C), no State(or political subdivision thereof) may prescribe or attempt to enforce,for the purposes of motor vehicle emission control, any control or prohibitionrespecting use of a fuel or fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicleengine_(i) if the Administrator has found that no control or prohibitionunder paragraph (1) is necessary and has published his finding in the FederalRegister, or (ii) if the Administrator has prescribed under paragraph (1)a control prohibition applicable to such fuel or fuel additive, unless[the] State prohibition or control is identical to the prohibition or controlprescribed by the Administrator.''Thus in light of the new Federal volatility rule, the state control wouldnormally be preempted.However, even though preemption has occurred, EPA may still approve certainstate provision for limits on RVP of fuel where a finding under section211(c)(4) is made which would authorize EPA approval and, thus, eliminatethe preemption problem. As set forth below, section 211(c)(4)(C) authorizesEPA to approve into the SIP a state-adopted fuel control measure that hasotherwise been preempted by EPA action if EPA finds that the state control``is necessary to achieve'' the standard that the SIP implements.Section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act, in setting forth the circumstances underwhich an exception to Federal preemption of state regulation may occur,states: ``A State may prescribe and enforce, for purposes of motor vehicleemission control, a control or prohibition respecting the use of a fuelor fuel additive in a motor vehicle or motor vehicle engine if an applicableimplementation plan for such State under section 110 so provides. The administratormay approve such provision in an implementation plan, or promulgate animplementation plan containing such a provision, only if he finds thatthe State control or prohibition is necessary to achieve the national primaryor secondary ambient air quality standard which the plan implements.''In the <T4>Federal Register</T4> discussion of EPA's approval of a state oxygenatedfuels program in the Maricopa County, Arizona SIP, EPA interpreted thislanguage as requiring the Agency to find that a fuel control requirementwas essential to achieve timely attainment of the primary standard forcarbon monoxide. EPA said further that a fuel control measure may be ``necessary''for timely attainment if no other measures that would bring about timelyattainment exist, or if such other measures exist and are technically possibleto implement, but are unreasonable or impracticable. Otherwise, no fuelcontrol would ever be ``necessary,'' since for any area there is at leastone measure_namely, required shutdowns and prohibitions on driving_thatwould result in timely attainment of the NAAQS. It is doubtful that Congresswould have intended to bar EPA from approving State fuel controls intoa SIP based on the availability of such drastic alternatives.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T4>Federal Register</T4> August 1, 1988, 53 FR 30220, 30228.<ITAG tagnum="85">Evaluation of How the New Jersey Revision Satisfies the ``Necessary''Criterion</ITAG>In its 1982 SIP, New Jersey estimated that emissions of volatile organiccompounds (VOCs) would need to be reduced by 59 percent from 1980 levelsin order to attain the ozone standard in the New Jersey portion of theNew Jersey/New York/Connecticut Air Quality Control Region (AQCR) by 1987.This percent reduction was estimated to be equivalent to 252,800 tons peryear (tpy) of VOCs. EPA has reviewed the progress the State has made inachieving these emission reductions and determined that the State has onlyachieved a 39.8 percent reduction from 1980 levels; a reduction of 82,330tpy identified in the SIP as necessary to attain the standard has yet tobe achieved. The reasons for these shortfalls are varied and include increasedRVP in gasoline, inability to implement certain measures, higher than anticipatedgrowth in vehicle miles traveled, less than anticipated effectiveness ofthe inspection and maintenance program, and the finding that some of themeasures the State committed to in 1982 are not reasonably available.The New Jersey submittal concludes that by lowering RVP to 9.0 psi, VOCemission reductions of approximately 24,000 tpy would be obtained statewide,with 13,400 tpy of the reduction occurring in the New Jersey/New York/ConnecticutAQCR. The quantity of this reduction was derived using the AP-42 emissionfactors for storage and transfer of gasoline and from the EPA MOBILE3 emissionfactor model for motor vehicle emissions. This estimate may understatethe actual reductions resulting from RVP controls because it does not includethe emissions reductions that would result from decreased running lossesassociated with lower volatility gasoline. Running losses are emissionsfrom the gasoline tank and fuel system that occur while a car is beingdriven and which overload the evaporative control system or escape throughthe filler cap. This 24,000 tpy reduction represents nearly 8 percent ofthe State's total annual VOC inventory and 19 percent of the ozone seasonVOC inventory. On a worst case basis, considering hot weather (95 degreesFahrenheit) and longer trip lengths, the reduction in VOC emissions providedby RVP control could be as high as 63 percent.Using information available in the New Jersey SIP and Reasonable FurtherProgress Report for 1987, along with supplemental information submittedby the State, EPA determined that New Jersey has only achieved a 39.8 percentreduction from 1980 levels in the New Jersey/New York/Connecticut AQCR.This translates to at least a 31.9 percent reduction from the 1987 inventory.It is also important to recognize that the 59 percent emission reductionthat guided New Jersey's selection of control measures has proven to betoo low. EPA's experience with Regional Oxidant Model runs for the Northeastindicates that a VOC emission reduction on the order of at least 75 percentfrom 1980 levels is needed for attainment of the ozone standard. Underthis scenario, the emission reductions needed for attainment of the ozonestandard translate to at least a 58.8 percent reduction from the 1987 inventory,or 68,556 tpy in addition to the 252,800 tpy that has been identified inthe SIP.The VOC strategies identified by the State as having the greatest potentialfor significant future VOC reductions that have not been implemented are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/>  <H1>Measure </H1><H1>Reduction (tpy) </H1><H1>Percent of 1987 inventory</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Reducing RVP from 11.5 to 9.0 <D>13,400 </D><D>5.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Architectural Coating <D>9,650 </D><D>\1\ 3.7 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Lower Exclusion Rates <D>20,100 </D><D>7.8 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Barge/Tanker Loading <D>3,900 </D><D>\2\ 1.5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Additional Consumer/Commercial Solvent Control <D>6,030 </D><D>\1\ 2.3 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Automobile Refinishing <D>3,020 </D><D>\1\ 1.2</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">I/M Enhancements <D>10,600 </D><D>4.1</D><R>n,s,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total <D>66,700 </D><D>25.8 </D><F>\1\Many solvents and coatings cannot be fully reformulated or replacedand, because they are area source emissions, cannot be effectively capturedand controlled. Based upon New Jersey's experience, only 20 percent ofthese emissions reductions may be achievable in the foreseeable future.However, this table assumes 100 percent effectiveness based upon the State'sestimate. There will be an additional 14,960 tpy VOC emissions reductionshortfall for these measures based upon a 20 percent effectiveness assumption.</F><F>\2\Due to delays caused by a safety study being conducted by the U.S.Coast Guard, it will be at least two years before any emission reductionscan be obtained through this measure.</F></ITAG></ITAG> The potential combined reductions from other categories suggested by EPAfor examination by other NESCAUM states, if found practicable, may providean additional 0.6 percent emission reduction. This would yield a totalreduction of 26.4 percent if all were 100 percent effective. There wouldstill be at least a 5.5 percent VOC emission reduction shortfall. By reducing RVP to 9.0 psi instead of 10.5 psi, New Jersey wuld be ableto obtain additional reductions of approximately 5,896 tpy. Therefore,even with EPA's RVP regulation requiring control to 10.5 psi in 1989, theState regulation will still have a significant impact. It will provide,approximately, an additional 2.3 percent reduction per year beyond theEPA reduction. Thus, New Jersey's RVP program appears to meet the appropriate test ofbeing ``necessary'' to achieve attainment of the ozone standard. The factthat the State RVP regulation might not by itself fill the remaining shortfalland hence by itself achieve the standard does not mean the rule would notbe ``necessary'' to achieve the standard within the meaning of section211(c)(4)(C). EPA believes that if Congress had intended EPA to approvea state fuel-content rule only if it were necessary and sufficient to achievethe standard, then it would have used that language in section 211(c)(4)(C).EPA believes that the ``necessary to achieve'' standard must be interpretedto apply to measures which are needed to reduce ambient levels (thus bringingthe area closer to achieving the NAAQS) when no other reasonable measuresare available to achieve this reduction. A contrary application of ``necessaryto achieve'' in this situation would mean that measures which result insignificantly improved air quality are nonetheless unacceptable (even thoughno other reasonable measures are available) merely because they are insufficientto themselves provide the reductions necessary to achieve attainment ofthe NAAQS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Enforceability</ITAG>In EPA's review for the enforceability of the New Jersey revision a problemwith the test methods section was revealed. The State requires that testingshall be conducted in accordance with the American Society for Testingand Materials (ASTM) method D-323. While method D-323 may represent thecurrent ASTM designation of the approved test method for determining fuelvolatility and, as such, is the industry standard, EPA has adopted a finalvolatility rule which includes a test method based upon an ASTM proposedmodification to method D-323 known as Annex 2. The State has committedto revise this section in order to resolve this issue. EPA is proposingto approve the State's RVP controls with the understanding that the Statemust revise the test methods section to include the EPA recognized methods.EPA is confident that the State will pursue this course of action becausethe State has included method D-323 in its regulation already. Moreover,the State interprets this portion of the regulation to mean that additionsto method D-323, such as Annex 2, will be incorporated into New Jersey'senforcement procedures upon finalization by ASTM.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve this revision to the New Jersey Ozone StateImplementation Plan to control gasoline volatility with the understandingthat the State will revise the test method section of the regulation. EPAis also proposing to make a finding that this SIP revision meets the requirementsof section 211(c)(4)(C) of the Act for an exception to federal preemption.This finding is required since EPA has finalized national volatility standards.EPA is soliciting public comments on its proposed action. Comments willbe considered before taking final action. Interested parties may participatein the federal rulemaking procedure by submitting written comments to theaddress noted at the beginning of today's notice.This notice is issued as required by section 110 of the Clean Air Act,as amended. The Administrator's decision regarding the approval of thisplan revision is based on its meeting the requirements of section 110 ofthe Clean Air Act, and 40 CFR Part 51.Under 5 U.S.C. section 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Hydrocarbons, Ozone.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William J.
