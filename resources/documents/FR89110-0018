Background</ITAG>The Board has recently proposed substantial revisions to its regulationsdefining regulatory capital and establishing minimum capital requirementsfor insured institutions. Board Res. No. 88-1342, 53 FR 51800 (December23, 1988). The proposal would establish new capital requirements on thebasis of the various risks an insured institution's portfolio may presentto the FSLIC and to the institution itself (``risk-based capital proposal'').Under the risk-based capital proposal, institutions would be required tomaintain a minimum capital level equal to the higher of two requirements.The first would be based upon the credit risk and interest-rate risk presentedby its portfolio and its level of collateralized borrowings and would equalapproximately eight percent of risk-weighted assets. The second would equaltwo percent of an institution's total assets, in recognition that the risk-weightingprovisions of the capital proposal do not address all risks to which aninstitution may be subject.An institution could satisfy the first capital requirement with a varietyof elements, including contributions to capital, retained earnings, maturingsubordinated debt instruments, and general loan loss allowances. The proposalwould establish a two-tiered requirement, with certain components qualifyingfor inclusion as ``core equity capital'' and others restricted to use as``supplementary capital.'' ``Core equity capital'' would equal capitalas computed in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles,commonly referred to as ``GAAP'', with some modification. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 51812. Half of an institution's capital as determinedunder the first test would have to be held in the form of core equity capital.The second minimum capital requirement could only be met with core equitycapital. Because all institutions would be required to hold an amount ofcapital equal to the higher of these two requirements, no insured institutioncould hold core equity capital in an amount below 2% of its total assetsand still satisfy its minimum regulatory capital requirements.Both the Board's current regulation and the risk-based capital proposalprovide that the Board may require one or more corrective actions, throughenforcement proceedings or otherwise, of thrift institutions that failto meet their capital requirements. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.13(d) (1988) (existing), 563.13(g) (proposed).These corrective actions include requiring an insured institution to increasecapital, hold meetings with supervisory personnel, conform with lendingand investment restrictions, and restrict a variety of account or depositactivities, including growth. The Board's policy is to use these toolsto improve the capital levels of insured institutions whenever possible.As part of its overall supervision of an insured institution, it may enterinto a supervisory agreement with an institution that is operating withinsufficient capital. Such an agreement may authorize a variety of actions,including the replacement of an institution's management or a supervisorymerger. The Board's goal is, as it has always been, to achieve the safeand sound operation of all insured institutions, including adequate capitallevels for each insured institution, by the least disruptive and most effectivemeans available.The Board is considering, and by this Advance Notice, soliciting publiccomment on, whether its authority to take corrective actions when an institutionfalls below its minimum regulatory capital levels should be clarified.The Board contemplates regulatory provisions establishing failure to maintaina floor or ``subminimum'' level of capital as an unsafe or unsound conditionto transact business for purposes of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933(``HOLA'') and the National Housing Act (``NHA''). Such a regulatory provisionwould clarify the Board's existing ability to appoint a conservator orreceiver before an insured institution reaches insolvency if, in the Board'sjudgment, no other effective regulatory action would be sufficient.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Issues Presented</ITAG>1. Board's Authority to Establish Failure To Maintain a Required Levelof Capital as an Unsafe or Unsound ConditionThe HOLA sets forth five grounds for the Board's appointment of a conservatoror receiver for a federal association. <T3>See </T3>HOLA section 5(d)(6)(A), 12 U.S.C. 1464(d)(6)(A). The statutedoes not require that all of these grounds, or any combination of them,must exist before such regulatory intervention. Each, standing alone, maysupport such action. The grounds are: (1) Insolvency; (2) substantial dissipationof assets or earnings due to any violation of law, rules, or regulationsor any unsafe or unsound practices(s); (3) an unsafe or unsound conditionto transact business; (4) willful violation of a cease and desist orderwhich has become final; and (5) concealment of or refusal to produce forinspection the books, papers, records or assets of the institution. <T3>Id. </T3>In addition, the NHA grants the Board exclusive power andjurisdiction to appoint the FSLIC as sole receiver for state-charteredinsured institutions where it determines that insolvency, a substantialdissipation of assets, or an unsafe or unsound condition exists.\1\<NOTE/> Neither statute further defines these conditions in thiscontext. Under such circumstances, the Board has considered whether a regulatorydefinition of an ``unsafe or unsound condition to transact business'' wouldfurther the statutory objectives. The Board believes that it would.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ <T3>See </T3>NHA section 406(c)(1)(B)(i)(I), 12 U.S.C. 1729(c)(1)(B)(i)(I).In addition, the Board may appoint a receiver for a state-chartered institutionon any of the five grounds enumerated in the HOLA, once it has been closedby a state authority and certain technical requirements have been satisfied,pursuant to section 406(c)(2) of the NHA.The Board has the authority to issue regulations to ensure the safety andsoundness of insured institutions. Since its enactment in 1934, the NHAhas contained a grant of general rulemaking authority, empowering the Boardto make rules to carryout the purposes of the Act. 12 U.S.C. 1725(a). Twokey purposes of the NHA are the protection of the FSLIC fund from excessiverisk \2\<NOTE/> and the development and maintenance of a safe and sound economicsystem of home financing.\3\<NOTE/> <T3>See also Lincoln Savings </T3>v. <T3>Federal Home Loan Bank Board, </T3>856 F.2d 1588 (DC Cir. 1988). Thedetermination in a regulation of what can constitute unsafe or unsoundpractices and conditions follows logically from this authority.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ The title of the bill that became the National HousingAct identified it as a bill to, <T3>inter alia, </T3>``promote thrift and protect savings''. <T3>See also </T3>specific provisions of the NHA which are directed towardachieving this objective, <T3>e.g., </T3>12 U.S.C. 1726(b) (provisions for examination of insuredinstitutions and for reserves); section 1726(c) (provisions for safe managementand financial policies); section 1730 (provisions regarding unsafe or unsoundpractices).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ One example illustrating this purpose is found at section403(c) of the NHA, 12 U.S.C. 1726(c). That section provides that the FSLICmay reject the application of a state-chartered institution if the applicant's``home-financing policy is inconsistent with economical home financingor with the purpose of this subchapter.'' <T3>See also, </T3>78 Cong. Rec. 11196, 11198 (Remarks of RepresentativesReilly and Williams) (June 12, 1934); 78 Cong. Rec. 12013-15 (Senate statementof objectives of the NHA) (June 16, 1934).In this regard, the next question presented is what would be an appropriateindicator of an unsafe or unsound condition. The Board believes that aninsured institution's capital level is one of the appropriate indicia ofits health and that inadequate capital is an appropriate indicator of anunsafe and unsound condition to transact business. Congress has recognizedthe critical importance of capital and the use of levels of capital asa regulatory measurement device. In the Competitive Equality Banking Actof 1987 (``CEBA''), it provided that the Board and FSLIC may, in theirdiscretion, treat the inability of a federal association or an insuredinstitution ``to maintain capital at or above the minimum level required* * * as an unsafe or unsound practice'' [within the meaning of 12 U.S.C.1464(d) or 12 U.S.C. 1730(e)]. 12 U.S.C. 1464(s)(3); 1730(t)(3). This maytrigger a variety of enforcement actions.Additionally, by establishing a CEBA a specific capital forbearance programwhereby a ``troubled but well-managed'' institution ``With net worth of0.5 percent or more, as determined in accordance with regulatory accountingprinciples, <T3>may be allowed </T3>to continue to operate and be eligible for capitalforbearance'' if it met certain conditions and adhered to an approved capitalrecovery plan, Congress impicitly recognized that institutions in weakenedcapital conditions but not yet insolvent and not qualifying for capitalforbearance <T3>might not be allowed </T3>to continue to operate. <T3>See </T3>12 U.S.C. 1467(a), 1730i (emphasis added). These provisions, taken as a whole, demonstrate Congress's recognitionof capital levels as an appropriate standard for the Board to use in determiningwhether to take a variety of regulatory and enforcement actions. It isless clear, however, what relationship Congress intended the capital adequacyprovisions of CEBA to bear to the Board's existing authority to appointconservators and receivers. Thus, the Board requests comment on the interactionof the statutory provisions governing capital standards with those governingthe appointment of conservators and receivers in establishing a regulatorydefinition of unsafe and unsound condition tied to capital and in implementingsuch a definition. The Board wishes to emphasize that nothing in this Notice should be construedas in any way indicating that the Board will not, when and where appropriate,use other criteria to determine the existence of an unsafe or unsound condition.For example, in the past, inability to meet liabilities or obligationshas been considered evidence of operation in an unsafe or unsound condition.<T3>See Washington Federal Savings and Loan Association </T3>v. <T3>Federal Home Loan Bank Board, </T3>526 F. Supp. 343 (N.D. Ohio 1981).Neither CEBA nor this Notice calls into question the Board's authorityto act in such a case.2. Appropriate Triggers for Regulatory Intervention The Board is considering establishing a ``floor'' capital requirement belowwhich an institution would, by definition, be considered to be operatingin an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business. Such a requirementwould further the Board's goal of providing institutions with sufficientincentives to conduct business in a prudent manner as well as providinga ``bright line'' test for possible regulatory intervention. The Board is considering setting this requirement at a level of 1.5% oftotal assets, to be held in the form of core equity capital. This levelis intentionally lower than the alternate minimum capital requirement of2% of total assets, also to be held in the form of core equity capital,discussed in Part A above. As discussed above, in Part B.1, operation belowthe <T3>minimum </T3>capital requirement may be considered an unsafe or unsound<T3>practice. </T3>12 U.S.C. 1464(s)(3), 1730(t)(3). Today, the Board isaddressing establishment of a ``subminimum'' or floor capital level, operationbelow which would constitute an unsafe and unsound <T3>condition. </T3>While an unsafe or unsound practice does not imperilan institution in a manner necessitating the appointment of a conservatoror receiver unless the practice results in the substantial dissipationof assets, the existence of an unsafe or unsound condition calls for decisiveaction by the Board to protect account holders and the public. The contemplated subminimum or floor capital requirement would be tiedto core equity, rather than total, capital because the Board believes thatcore equity capital provides the best protection to the FSLIC and is thebest indicator of the institution's ability to absorb losses. The Boardsolicits comments, with any available supporting empirical data, on whetherthe required level should be higher or lower. Commenters may wish to discusswhether this requirement should be tied to core equity capital or whethertangible capital would be a more appropriate measure. The capital floor would be designed primarily to provide additional protectionto the FSLIC by clarifying that the Board may take active management controlof a deteriorating institution by appointing a conservator or receiverwhere the institution has not reached insolvency but is in a substantiallyweakened, or weakening, capital condition.Implementation of this objective raises the further question whether theBoard may, or should, act solely upon the finding that an insured institutionhas reached the specified floor capital level. The Board invites commentsand suggestions regarding any other, additional factors that should beconsidered when making the determination that an institution is operatingin an unsafe or unsound condition under a scheme of regulatory intervention.The Board also notes that fiscal constraints, together with other factorssuch as the impact of Board action on local economies, may make it difficult,impossible, or unwise for it to take action under a regulatory interventionrule with respect to all of the insured institutions that have reachedthe floor capital level at any given time. At the same time, the Boardwishes to avoid unnecessary disparity in its treatment of similarly situatedinstitutions. In this regard, the Board invites suggestions about the factorsit should consider in prioritizing its caseload of institutions found tobe in an unsafe or unsound condition.The Board also wishes to consider suggestions as to the mechanics of establishingthat an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition based upon itscapital level. For instance, the Board invites comment on whether it shouldestablish that an institution has been operating with capital below 1.5%of total assets for some specified period of time prior to consideringit to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. Commenters addressing thisissue are invited to discuss what period of time would be meaningful.3. Procedural IssuesAs discussed above, the Board has the authority under the HOLA and theNHA to appoint a conservator or receiver for an insured institution operatingin an unsafe or unsound condition. Such an action could result in a lossof any property interests held by shareholders of stock institutions ormembers of mutual institutions. The Board believes, however, that it cancreate standards for the proper use of this authority by promulgating regulationspursuant to section 402 of the NHA. <T3>See Lincoln, </T3>supra. In this regard, the Board wishes to solicitcomments on a variety of procedural issues detailed below.Both the current and proposed capital regulations provide for a seriesof corrective actions that the FSLIC may require when an institution failsto meet its minimum capital requirement. 12 CFR 563.13(d) (1988) (current),563.13(g) (proposed). These actions are wide-ranging and, while they areaimed at remedying shortfalls in capital, they also serve to place institutionson notice that the FSLIC regards their capital levels as dangerously low.The Board is interested in comments that address whether these measuresprovide notice sufficient to address any fairness or due process concernprior to a Board determination that a particular institution is in an unsafeor unsound condition, or whether it must, or should, establish proceduresto give notice and an opportunity to respond to institutions operatingwith capital approaching the 1.5% level prior to such determination. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR 563.14-1 (issuance of capital directives, includingan example of notice procedures). In this regard, the Board is concernedthat all institutions be accorded adequate procedural protections and seekssuggestions to ensure fair treatment.Additional fairness or due process issues may arise once the Board makesa determination that an institution is in an unsafe or unsound condition.As further discussed below, the Board has formulated some preliminary viewson such issues, but invites commenters to submit other analyses of thequestions raised here.The Board believes that the statutory provisions governing receivershipchallenges satisfy any procedural rights of the owners of insured institutionsfound to be in an unsafe or unsound condition. Both the HOLA and the NHAprovide that an institution for which the Board appoints a conservatoror receiver may, within thirty days, bring an action in federal districtcourt for an order to remove the appointee. <T3>See </T3>HOLA section 5(d)(6)(A), 12 U.S.C. 1464(d)(6)(A); NHA section406(c)(3)(A), 12 U.S.C. 1729(c)(3)(A). The statutes further provide thatsuch an action will be given precedence over other pending cases and, uponconsideration of the merits, the court will either dismiss the action ororder the Board to remove the conservator or receiver. <T3>Id.</T3>In <T3>Fahey v. Mallonee, </T3>332 U.S. 245, 253-54 (1947), the Supreme Courtupheld then-current Board regulations (later embodied in the HOLA and NHA)that provided for a hearing following, rather than preceding, the appointmentof a conservator or receiver for a federal association against a due processchallenge. <T3>See also Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation v. Mallen, </T3>486U.S. <T2>XX</T2>, 100 L. Ed. 2d 265, 278, 108 Sup. Ct. <T2>XX</T2> (1988) (unanimous decision that the Federal Deposit InsuranceAct provisions for a hearing following rather than preceding the suspensionof an indicted bank officer were justified by the FDIC's need to be ableto act promptly and effectively where necessary to protect the interestsof depositors and to maintain public confidence in banking institutions).The Board believes that the statutory provisions for immediate judicialreview on the merits therefore afford adequate due process for the shareholdersof insured institutions affected by regulatory intervention, especiallyin light of the competing concern that advance notice of the Board's intentto intervene in the case of a particular insured institution may itselfcause further reductions in the institution's capital and a dissipationof its assets. <T3>See Fahey, </T3>332 U.S. at 253.Moreover, the regulations regarding the priority of claims in a receivershipadequately provide for any constitutionally protected property intereststhat shareholders may have. Section 569c.11(a)(10) of Title 12 of the Codeof Federal Regulations provides that holders of nonwithdrawable accounts,including stock, shall have priority, after depositors and general creditorsof the institution, in accordance with the written instruments that evidencesuch claims. 53 FR 25129, 25133 (July 5, 1988).While members of mutual savings and loan associations are not specificallymentioned in the priority scheme, the courts have not generally given significantweight to a member's interest beyond its deposit in the institution. Thecourts have viewed a mutual savings and loan member's interest as primarilythat of a creditor of the association and only secondarily as that of anequity owner. <T3>See Washington Federal,</T3> 526 F. Supp. at 400, citing <T3>York</T3> v. <T3>Federal Home Loan Bank Board,</T3> 624 F.2d 495, 500 (4th Cir. 1980).This view is supported by the fact that depositors of a mutual institutionare not allowed to realize or share in profits of the association but onlyreceive an established rate of interest. In addition, because members'sdeposits are federally insured to the statutory maximum, they do not sharein the institution's risk of loss.<T3> Id.</T3>The Supreme Court has disposed of arguments made by members of mutual institutionsasserting an interest in anything beyond their deposits as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The asserted interest of the depositors is in the surplus of the bank,which is primarily a reserve against losses and secondarily a repositoryof undivided earnings. So long as the bank remains solvent, depositorsreceive a return on this fund only as an element of the interest paid ontheir deposits. If a depositor withdraws from the bank, he receives onlyhis deposits and interest. If he continues, his only chance of gettinganything more would be in the unlikely event of a solvent liquidation,a possibility that hardly rises to the level of an expectancy. It stretchesthe imagination very far to attribute any real value to such a remote contingency,and when coupled with the fact that it represents nothing which the depositorscan readily transfer, any theoretical value reduces almost to the vanishingpoint.\4\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ <T3> Society for Savings </T3>v. <T3>Bowers,</T3> 349 U.S. 143, 150, 75 Sup. Ct. 607, 611, 99 L.Ed. 950(1955).The Board solicits comments on whether the regulations regarding creditorpriorities would satisfy constitutional requirements for compensation shouldthe Board's action be construed as a taking under the Fifth Amendment andwhether specific provisions should be made for a member's equity interestin a mutually held institution to address the possibility of that interesthaving some value in a liquidation.In addition, the Board wishes to consider whether, and to what extent,the ``Takings Clause'' of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitutionwould apply in a regulatory intervention context. That clause providesthat private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation.U.S. Constitution amendment V. Owners of insured institutions where a receiveris appointed on grounds that an unsafe or unsound condition exists, ratherthan on grounds of insolvency, may argue that the Board's appointment constitutesa Fifth Amendment ``taking''.A preliminary analysis of the case law suggests that such action by theBoard would not constitute interference with property rights so as to violatethe Fifth Amendment. Courts have said that the purpose of the Fifth AmendmentTakings Clause is to ``bar the government from forcing some people aloneto bear public burdens which in all fairness and justice, should be borneby the public as a whole.'' \5\<NOTE/> It is well established that Congress is entitled to createstatutory rights and liabilities that are rationally related to a legitimategovernment purpose.\6\<NOTE/> Moreover, Congress can create public programs that adjustthe benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good; thegovernment may affect property rights under such programs without engagingin a compensable taking under the Fifth Amendment.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\<T3> Connolly </T3>v. <T3>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, </T3>475 U.S. 211. 227 (1986)citing <T3>Armstrong </T3> v. <T3>United States,</T3> 364 U.S. 40, 49 (1960).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\<T3> Motor andamp; Equipment Manufacturers' Association, Inc., </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>267 F.2d 1095, 1127 (DC Cir 1979), <T3>cert. denied, General Motors Corp. </T3>v. <T3>Costle,</T3> 446 U.S. 952 (1980).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\<T3> Connolly,</T3> 475 U.S. at 225. <T3>See Penn Central Transportation Co. </T3>v. <T3>New York City, </T3>438 U.S. 104, 124 (1978);<T3> Usery </T3>v. <T3>Turner Elkhorn Mining Co.,</T3> 428 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1976).In the Board's view, the regulation of thrifts by the Federal governmentconstitutes a public program as contemplated by the courts. By enactinglegislation to establish the Federal Home Loan Bank System, the Bank Board,and the FSLIC, Congress created a separately regulated housing financeindustry after the Great Depression. Since that time, Congress has seenfit to adjust the parameters under which the thrift industry operates aseconomic conditions have changed. Throughout this period, however, Congress'intention has been to establish a government program designed to promotehousing and protect depositors. It gave the Bank Board regulatory authorityover thrifts and specifically enumerated the grounds upon which the Boardmay appoint a conservator or receiver, including grounds other than insolvency.It also carefully crafted measures to provide a remedy to challenge suchan appointment by the affected association. The Supreme Court has not developed a set formula for determining whenjustice and fairness require that economic injuries caused by public actionbe compensated by the government.\8\<NOTE/> Recently, it has relied on an <T3>ad hoc</T3> factual analysis to determine whether a government actionconstitutes a Fifth Amendment taking. Three factors that have particularsignificance in the determination are: (1) The economic impact of the regulationon the claimant; (2) the extent to which the regulation has interferedwith distinct investment-backed expectations; and (3) the character ofthe governmental action.\9\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\<T3>Penn Central,</T3> 438 U.S. at 124. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\<T3>Connolly,</T3> 475 U.S. at 224-225. With respect to the first factor, the Court has analyzed regulatory schemesto determine whether those burdened bear only their rightful portion ofthe burden and whether there exist any provisions that serve to moderatethe economic impact of the program.\10\<NOTE/> In determining the extent to which the regulation interfereswith distinct investment-backed expectations, the Court considers whetherclaimants have advance notice of the regulation affecting their ownershiprights and asks what fairness and justice require by way of distributionof the burdens under the regulatory scheme.\11\<NOTE/> Finally, when attempting to determine the character of thegovernmental action, the Court asks, among other things, whether the governmenthas permanently appropriated assets <T3>for its own use</T3> and whether the action is incident to a publicprogram that adjusts the benefits and burdens of economic life for thepromotion of the public good.\12\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\<T3>Penn Central,</T3> 438 U.S. at 137. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\<T3>See Connolly,</T3> 475 U.S. at 226-227. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\<T3>Id.</T3> at 223-26. The Board's analysis of these factors based on the case law leads it tothe preliminary conclusion that the actions suggested in this notice wouldnot constitute a taking under the Fifth Amendment. First, Congress, inreaction to an economic crisis, determined that regulation of the nation'sfinancial institutions was necessary and important. It established theFSLIC in an effort to promote public confidence in the nation's thriftsby insuring deposits. As a condition of obtaining the benefits of thisoverall goal, thrift institutions were subject to regulations reasonablyaimed at protecting the safety and soundness of the industry as a wholeand the viability of the FSLIC fund. This statutory and regulatory scheme,including explicit factors that could cause regulatory intervention toappoint a conservator or receiver, has been in place since the 1930s. Shareholdersof insured institutions assume the risks and responsibilities placed uponthem under this regulatory design. They are not provided any assurancethat their investment in a thrift institution operating under this statutoryand regulatory scheme will continue to retain its value if all regulatoryrequirements are not satisfied. Second, as discussed above, both Congress and the Board have recognizedthat capital levels are an indicator of the health of an institution. Further,the operation of institutions below minimum capital requirements, especiallywhere such capital is steadily decreasing, erodes the public's confidencein the industry as a whole and endangers the continued viability of theinsurance fund. For these reasons, the Board believes that the operationof an institution at subminimum levels of capital could be explicitly definedas an unsafe or unsound condition such that regulatory intervention, includingbut not limited to the appointment of a conservator or receiver, is justified.Finally, conservators and receivers do not appropriate the assets of institutionsfor the government's own use. Instead, they preserve such assets for theuse of depositors and other creditors of the institution who do not investin an insured instituton with the same expectations of risk should theinstitution fail to operate in accordance with regulatory guidelines aswould a shareholder. The Board invites comment on all aspects of this Notice. Comments are particularlysolicited as to what additional administrative or regulatory proceduresmight be appropriate to implement any rulemaking on this subject. Afterreviewing the comments received, the Board anticipates promulgating a noticeof proposed rulemaking, including regulatory language addressing a numberof the issues discussed in this Advance Notice. The Board contemplatesthat any final rulemaking regarding this proposal might be made effective30 days after its adoption. While the risk-based capital proposal has anextended transition period, the Board believes that it is important thatit take action with respect to institutions operating under unsafe andunsound conditions promptly. Finally, the Board has announced that it will be holding a public hearingon the risk-based capital proposal. The Board anticipates a discussionof the regulatory intervention issues discussed in this Advance Noticeat that time. The date of the hearing will be published in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> <ITAG tagnum="21">By the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Nadine Y.
