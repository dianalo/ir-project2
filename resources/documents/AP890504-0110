Kan, a 19-year-old sophomore from Yantai, a seaside city inShandong province, was one of several hundred students from schoolsoutside of Beijing who participated in the march.   Either organized in tight little groups with a big red banner ortagging along with a new-found friend from a Beijing school, the``outsiders'' made their mark.   ``Look,'' yelled a Beijing worker at one intersection as theflags from schools across the country passed. ``It looks like allof China's students are on the march.''   Students from at least 10 other universities around China andHong Kong marched with tens of thousands of Beijing students andtheir supporters, calling for freedom and democracy.   Like many students from out of town, Kan was in Beijing on aclass trip to the capital to commemorate the 70th anniversary ofthe May Fourth Movement, China's first student movement.   ``I had a chance to choose between our ancient culture and thefuture of China,'' she said. ``I took China's future. Maybe myteacher will be mad at me, but it doesn't matter.''   Waving his red Nankai University flag above his head, Li Ying ofTianjin called about 30 of fellow students to fall in line.   ``Let's study our classmates from Beijing,'' he said. ``Theirorder is worthy of profound research.''   Li came to Beijing especially to take part in the protest. Astudent leader at Nankai in Tianjin, a port city just east ofBeijing, Li has helped organize a class boycott at his school andseveral marches last week.   ``If the student movement is going to get any results, it mustbecome a nationwide organization,'' he said. ``Seeing Beijing thislively is good for us.''   As he spoke, the crowd around him broke into a chant.   ``Down with bureaucracy! Down with corruption!'' it said.   Up until late last week, efforts to coordinate the protest andenlarge its scope seemed to be failing. But on Tuesday andThursday, thousands of students from Fudan University in Shanghaiand other schools took to the streets to call for fundamentalpolitical change. Students in Tianjin and Shanghai also began aclass boycott which like Beijing's is set to end Friday.   ``These were our first political protests so far,'' said oneFudan student of the demonstrations in Shanghai. ``Before that wewere just commemorating Hu Yaobang.''   Hu was purged from his post as Communist Party chief in 1987 forallegedly not cracking down heavily hard enough on studentdemonstrations in 1986-87. As such he was a favorite of students.   Hong Kong student Yu Sunsing, 26, from Chinese University, saidhe supported the protest and hoped it would continue.   ``We came here to find out more about them and to give them somesupport,'' said Yu, who brought a donation of about $1,280 from hisschool's student union for the movement.   His university also had a rally of 3,000 people in support ofthe Beijing march Thursday.   At Beijing Normal University, a banner read, ``Classmates fromout of town.''   ``We say in Changsha that if Beijing strikes it's history but ifChangsha boycotts, nobody cares,'' said one student from theprovincial capital of Hunan. ``I wanted to be a part of history.''</TEXT></DOC>
