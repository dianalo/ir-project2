But RJR Treasurer Fred Zuckerman increased his holdings inthe huge tobacco and food company 25% with a $200,000 stockpurchase last month, filings with the Securities and ExchangeCommission show. Mr. Zuckerman bought 20,000 RJR shares Feb.7, according to the filings.</LP><TEXT>   He paid $10 a share, the same price at which the stockclosed yesterday in New York Stock Exchange trading. Mr.Zuckerman now owns 100,000 shares.   &quot;I'm confident that the value of this company will grow ata rate faster than the overall market,&quot; Mr. Zuckerman saidyesterday. But he added that with the SEC reviewing a planned$1.2 billion RJR bond offering slated for the spring, hecouldn't &quot;say anything to hype the stock.&quot;   Insider activity at RJR is unusual. Many of the topofficers are precluded, until 1993, from selling the largeblocks of stock they received in the LBO, and most own somuch stock they're not adding to it. But Mr. Zuckerman was alatecomer to the company, joining in February 1991. Insiderstock ownership at RJR is &quot;very strongly encouraged,&quot; theexecutive noted.   The company's shares missed out on the recent stock marketrally. Many individual and institutional investors simplydon't play the stock because of its high debt burden, whilesome major institutions' investment policies bar them frombuying the stock because of a high price-earnings ratio basedon trailing 12-month earnings.   But some analysts say the company is gradually, andsuccessfully, addressing its leverage problems by paying downand restructuring debt. But they say RJR still has further togo to gain back market share in its core business,cigarettes.   &quot;Cigarette sales are down for the whole industry, but RJRis leading the pack on the way down,&quot; said Dean WitterReynolds Inc. analyst David Goldman. What RJR is facing isdecreased consumption of cigarettes in the U.S. in general,and of the Winston and Salem brands in particular. Moreover,the U.S. Surgeon General earlier this week requested that RJRdiscontinue its &quot;Joe Camel&quot; ad campaign for Camel cigarettes,because of the cartoon character's appeal to children.   Nonetheless, given the &quot;lower base&quot; RJR stock price isstarting at relative to competitors such as Philip MorrisCos., Mr. Goldman says almost any earnings surprises, or anyfurther inroads into cutting debt, could boost RJR's stock.He thinks both are likely and, for that reason, he'srecommending buying the stock.   In the fourth quarter, RJR had net income of $161 million,or 14 cents a share, mainly reflecting reduced interestexpense. Two weeks ago, RJR lightened its debt load, usingbank loans to retire nearly $1 billion of junk bonds yieldingan average of 14.9%. The company's planned bond offeringwould pay the bank loans.</TEXT></DOC>
