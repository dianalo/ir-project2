The purpose of this paper is todemonstrate the applicability of the S-net representation as a basictool for deriving failure symptoms. If one can generate symptoms automatically,the computer-aided plant safety analysis and diagnosis can be performedeasily by evaluating the influence of the failures on the whole plant.A specific description format called a 'network list' was introducedto implement the knowledge of the structure of the plant. The failuresymptoms are derived automatically, based on the knowledge of the structureof the plant, using a PROLOG-based database handling system. This approachallows us to derive the failure symptoms of the plant without using conventionalevent-chain models (e.g. a cause-consequence tree) which are subjectto human errors in their design and implementation. Applicability ofthis method was evaluated with a simulation model of the dynamics ofthe secondary system of a PWR.</TEXT></DOC>
