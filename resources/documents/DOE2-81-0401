Many companies are involvedin alcohols synthesis projects, based on high pressure or low pressuretechnologies, with motor-fuels and octane boosters as targets. The I.F.P.(France) Idemitsu (Japan) R and D program is focused on the co-productionof methanol and light C/sub 2+/ alcohols. These product mixtures yieldfavorable octane and methanol-compatibilizing properties. Pure linearsaturated alcohols are selectively produced by highly-dispersed multi-metalliccatalysts. The extent of chain-growth and related alcohols selectivitydepend strongly on the steady-state active phases composition, whichis determined by the operating parameters of reaction. Recent demonstrationof the process, under the RAPAD R and D program, has proven its feasibilityand good operability. Process economics are described. The developmentof such new technologies is of concern to countries lacking petroleumreserves or rich in natural gas. Syngas from natural gas is the mostpromising feedstock.</TEXT></DOC>
