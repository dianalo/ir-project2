The leaflets, which appeared Monday, also asked Arabs to holdcommercial strikes and stay home from their jobs today, Israelimedia said.   In another development, the army on Monday questioned an Arabyouth who said he and three other residents of the West Bankvillage Kfar Salem were buried alive by Israeli soldiers using abulldozer after a riot Feb. 5.   ``I am afraid. I thought I was going to die,'' said the youth,Abdel Latif Mahmoud Ishtiah, 19. ``I dream about it all the time.''   Relatives charge that 20 soldiers grabbed the four Palestiniansafter the riot, beat them, forced them to lie on the ground andthen poured sand over them with a bulldozer. The four wereunconcious when relatives rescued them after several minutes,according to villagers quoted in Israeli newspapers.   Two soldiers have been detained in the case, and furtherdetentions were expected, the army said. The West Bank's armycommander, Maj. Gen. Amram Mitzna, who ordered the investigation,said that ``even in my worst dreams I would never imagine such athing.''   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Monday attacked left-winglegislators who said soldiers had the right to refuse to obeyorders they considered illegal.   ``There is nothing more dangerous to Israel than soldiersdeciding what is bad and what is good, which orders to accept andwhich orders to reject,'' Israel radio quoted Rabin as saying.   In interviews with Israeli media, a number of soldiers have saidthey were troubled by orders to use beatings instead of bullets toquell Arab protests.   In a related development, the Hadashot newspaper on Monday saidthree soldiers of the elite Golani brigade were sentenced to jailterms of at least 21 days for using excessive force againstPalestinians.   The army said it had no information on the case.   In Jerusalem, riot police fired tear gas and rubber bullets inseveral locations Monday to disperse stone-throwing Arabs.   Police spokesman Rafi Levy said police did not use liveammunition, but a border police officer told photographers thatforces fired gunshots to subdue protesters in the Anataneighborhood.   Officals at Mukassad Hospital said they treated a 23-year-oldresident of the city's Shufat refugee camp for gunshot wounds tothe abdomen.   The Arab-run Palestine Press Service said the man was shotduring a clash at Shufat. It was the first report of bloodshed inJerusalem since anti-Israeli protests began Dec. 8.   In Jerusalem's Sur Bahir neighborhood, border police fired teargas to disperse Palestinians who erected roadblocks of twistedmetal and burning tires. Residents said border police broke intohomes.   They showed reporters smashed windows, an overturned televisionset and the shattered glass panels of a china cabinet.   Israel radio said 21 Arabs were arrested in Jerusalem on Monday,bringing to 437 the number of demonstrators detained in the holycity since Dec. 8. During that period, 54 Arabs have been killed byIsraelis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, according to U.N. figures.   In Jerusalem, members of the Gush Emunim settlement movementsaid they were printing flyers to be distributed in Arab areas. Theleaflets contain threats that if the protests continue, Arabs mightbe ousted from the West Bank, Israel television said.   In the political arena, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on Mondaycalled on his political rival, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, towork out a joint Israeli reaction to the new U.S. Middle East peaceinitiative.   ``It doesn't look so good that when American envoys come here,it appears there are two governments,'' Peres told Israeltelevision.   ``With the arrival of (Secretary of State George P.) Shultz,despite our differences of opinion, we need to sit together,''Peres said.   Shultz is expected to visit the Middle East later this month toseek support for the U.S. plan.   The proposal calls for an international opening in April tolaunch direct talks on an interim solution for the occupiedterritories. Negotiations of a final settlement would begin inDecember, regardless of the outcome of the interim talks.   Peres has accepted the U.S. plan while Shamir opposes keyelements as well as statements by Shultz that Israel must be readyto trade land for peace.</TEXT></DOC>
