Sources close to the GAO, the primary investigative arm ofCongress, told the Houston Post an investigation should becompleted by January. The newspaper did not identify the sources.   The newspaper also said a congressional committee would probablybegin hearings on the matter after the report is completed.   The GAO's investigation was prompted, in part, by newspaperreports about reputed mob associates Herman K. Beebe Sr. and MarioRenda and their connections to thrifts and to each other, the Postsaid.   Beebe, who is serving a one-year prison sentence for bank fraud,had connections to 12 failed Texas savings and loans.   Beebe is alleged to have ties to New Orleans Mafia boss CarlosMarcello, and the Post reported ties between Beebe and Renda, a NewYork money broker who allegedly is associated with the Gambino andLucchese crime families in New York.   Renda, who has been convicted of bank fraud in Kansas City, Mo.,Florida and New York, brokered deposits into at least six of thefailed Texas thrifts Beebe was connected to, including MainlandSavings Association, the largest thrift in Houston to fail.   Beebe helped the owners of at least four of the failed thriftsto buy the institutions and did business with at least eight otherfailed savings and loans, according to a 1985 U.S. Comptroller ofthe Currency report on Beebe, lawsuits filed by the failed thrift'sfederal receiver and Beebe's associates.   Officials with the Justice Department and the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp. have alleged that Beebe and Renda usedtheir connections to savings and loans to arrange loans forthemselves and their associates. The loans later went bad andcontributed to the failures of the thrifts, the paper said.   Federal investigators are now trying to determine if thoseconnections mean that Beebe and Renda were part of a largerconsiracy by the mob to control and loot savings and loans acrossthe country, said officials with the Justice Department organizedcrime strike forces in Texas and New York.</TEXT></DOC>
