Two of the plant's four units are now fully automated,while two other units are partially automated. The objectives of theupgrade program have been achieved through careful planning, developingcontrol system specifications, involving operating personnel, and developinga responsive working relationship with control equipment suppliers. Asa result, the old base-loaded plant has been transformed into a valuableautomated swing-load generating station with improved operating efficiencyand extended equipment life. In addition, Black Dog has implemented aneffective data acquisition system. This permits data from the controlsystem to be easily distributed throughout the NSP network. Using thesame data highway, orders received over the central load dispatch networkare communicated directly to master controls.</TEXT></DOC>
