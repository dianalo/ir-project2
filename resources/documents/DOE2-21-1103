In all thecases, it is found that the resulting depth profiles have a nonregularshape. A fraction which depends on the target material distributes alonga tail directed towards the surface. Due to the nonregularity of thedepth profiles, we present only the most probable ranges and the fullwidth half maxima of the distributions. These results are compared withthe Ziegler, Biersack and Littmark prediction. On the other hand, /sup3/He implanted into Mylar is found to be mobile at room temperature,as after ten days no trace of the implanted material is found in thesubstrate.</TEXT></DOC>
