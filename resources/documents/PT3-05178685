The silver-rich contacts      are formed by firing a silver ink or paste wherein substantially all of      the silver in the ink or paste before firing is in the form of spherical      particles. Preferably inter-cell connections to the contacts are      accomplished using a tin and silver solder paste comprising between about      96% tin/4% silver and 98% tin/2% silver. Solar cells having contacts      incorporating the present invention exhibit the capability of withstanding      temperatures in the range of 150.degree. C. with little or no thermal      degradation of contact peel strength in the region of the solder bonds. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAR>  This invention relates to an improvement in the method of manufacturing      photovoltaic solar cells and more particularly to an improved method of      forming and interconnecting contacts whereby to provide cells with greater      reliability. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Photovoltaic solar cells essentially comprise a semi-conductor substrate      having a shallow P-N junction formed adjacent the front surface thereof.      The cells require electrical contacts (also called &quot;electrodes&quot;) on both      their front and rear sides in order to be able to recover an electrical      current when the cells are exposed to solar radiation. The contact on the      front of the solar cell is generally made in the form of a grid,      comprising a plurality of narrow, elongate parallel fingers and at least      one elongate busbar that intersects the fingers at a right angle. The      width, number and spacing of the fingers are set so as to expose an      optimum area of the front surface of the cell to incident solar radiation.      The busbar serves as the solder bonding terminal for the grid contact      whereby the contact is interconnected with other cells. </PAR><PAR>  In order to improve the conversion efficiency of the cells, a thin      anti-reflection (&quot;AR&quot;) coating consisting of a material such as silicon      nitride is provided on the front side of each cell. The AR coating may be      applied before or after the grid electrode has been formed. </PAR><PAR>  Commercial acceptance of solar cells is conditioned upon the ability to      produce reliable, efficient and long-lasting cells and solar cell modules.      As used herein, the term &quot;solar cell module&quot; means a plurality of solar      cells that are interconnected electrically and physically so as to form a      discrete array that provides a predetermined voltage output, e.g., a      module may consist of 216 cells connected together so as to have a total      power output of 220 watts. Typically in such a module the cells are      arranged in a rectangular array comprising 12 strings each consisting of      18 cells, with the cells in each string being connected in series and the      strings being connected in parallel. The cells in each string are      interconnected by copper connecting strips (also called &quot;tabs&quot;) that are      bonded to the front and back electrodes. A selected number of such modules      may be connected together to form a solar panel having a desired power      output. </PAR><PAR>  The reliability and efficiency of solar cells are affected by the nature      and quality of their front and rear contacts. Accordingly, much effort has      been directed to developing reliable, low resistance, solderable contacts      and improving the techniques of making the contacts so as to reduce      breakage and thereby increase production yield of solar cells. </PAR><PAR>  Aluminum, because of its low cost and good electrical conductivity, is the      most common material used to fabricate the back contacts of solar cells.      Typically, the aluminum back contact is made by coating the rear side of a      silicon substrate with an aluminum paste (also called an &quot;ink&quot;). The terms      &quot;paste&quot; and &quot;ink&quot; are used interchangeably to describe contact-forming      liquid compositions comprising metal particles disposed in an organic      liquid vehicle. Therefore, in the context of this invention, both terms      are used to describe the viscous aluminum and silver compositions that are      used to form solar cell contacts. The aluminum pastes are fired so as to      remove the organic vehicle by evaporation and/or pyrolysis and cause the      metal particles to alloy with the silicon substrate and thereby form an      ohmic aluminum/silicon contact. Unfortunately, aluminum tends to form a      surface oxide when exposed to air. That surface oxide increases contact      resistance and also inhibits direct soldering. </PAR><PAR>  Various methods have been used for overcoming the aluminum soldering      problem. A currently favored technique involves first forming an aluminum      contact on the back of the solar cell substrate that is discontinuous in      the sense that it defines a plurality of openings (&quot;windows&quot;) through      which the underlying silicon substrate is exposed, and then applying a      suitable silver paste to those areas of the back surface of the substrate      that are exposed by the windows. These areas of silver paste are then      fired to form a plurality of silver &quot;soldering pads&quot;. Preferably the      silver soldering pads overlap the surrounding aluminum contact. These      soldering pads are used as solder bonding sites for cell interconnecting      tabs in the form of tin-coated copper ribbon which are used to      interconnect aluminum contact to adjacent solar cells. This technique is      described in copending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 561,101, filed      Aug. 1, 1990 by Frank Bottari et al for &quot;Method Of Applying Metallized      contacts To A Solar Cell&quot;. To the extent necessary, the information      disclosed in said U.S. application Ser. No. 561,101 is incorporated herein      by reference thereto. </PAR><PAR>  The grid contacts are commonly formed of silver or nickel. One prior art      method of forming the front grid contact involves applying a conductive      silver metal paste onto the front surface of a solar cell substrate in a      clearly defined grid electrode pattern, firing that paste so as to form a      bonded ohmic contact, and then applying the AR coating to the front      surface of the solar cell substrate. Another common procedure is to first      form the AR coating, then etch away portions of that coating so as to      expose portions of the front surface of the solar cell substrate in a grid      electrode pattern, and thereafter deposit a paste or otherwise form the      front contact in those regions where the AR coating has been removed. </PAR><PAR>  Still a third approach is the so-called &quot;fired through&quot; method which      consists of the following steps: (1) forming an AR coating on the front      surface of the solar cell substrate, (2) applying a coating of a paste      comprising metal particles and a glass frit onto the AR coating in a      predetermined pattern corresponding to the configuration of the desired      grid electrode, and (3) firing the paste at a temperature and for a time      sufficient to cause the metal/glass frit composition to dissolve the      underlying AR coating and form an ohmic contact with the underlying front      surface of the solar cell substrate. The &quot;fired through&quot; method of forming      contacts is illustrated by PCT patent application Publication No. WO      89/12321, published 14 Dec. 1989, based on U.S. application Ser. No.      205,304, filed 10 Jun. 1988 by Jack Hanoka for &quot;An Improved Method of      Fabricating Contacts For Solar Cells&quot;. The same concept of firing metal      contacts through an AR coating is further described in U.S. Pat. No.      4,737,197, issued to Y. Nagahara et al for &quot;Solar Cell With Metal Paste      Contact&quot;. The teachings of those documents is incorporated herein by      reference thereto. </PAR><PAR>  Attempts to reduce the cost of manufacturing solar cells have involved      investigation and use of a number of coating techniques for applying      metal-containing conductive inks to the solar cell to form contacts,      notably screen printing, pad printing, and direct writing. The pad      printing technique is preferred for forming aluminum back contacts with      windows filled with silver soldering pads because it permits formation of      contacts at a relatively low cost, with high throughput rates and very low      substrate breakage rates. The direct write technique is preferred for      applying a silver paste to the front side of the solar cell substrate to      form the busbars and fingers of the grid electrode. This technique is      illustrated and described in copending U.S. application Ser. No. 666,334      of Jack I. Hanoka et al, filed 7 Mar. 1991 for &quot;Method And Apparatus For      Forming Contacts&quot;. The teachings of that application are incorporated      herein by reference thereto. </PAR><PAR>  In the course of manufacture and in many common applications, the      photovoltaic cells are subjected to continuous high temperatures or else      to thermal cycles at regular or irregular intervals. For example, in the      ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) lamination procedure that typically follows      cell stringing (interconnecting) in the manufacture of multi-cell modules,      the cells are subjected to temperatures as high as about 150.degree. C.      for about 45-60 minutes. Also, when used in the production of solar      energy, the cells will heat up during a cycle of exposure to sunlight and      then cool down again to ambient temperatures at night. In other      applications, the heating and cooling cycles may be much more frequent.      Accordingly, an important requirement of such cells is the ability to      withstand thermal aging, particularly with respect to their solder      connections. </PAR><PAR>  The twin requirements of high reliability and efficiency have placed      significant demands upon the contacts metallization system. In this      connection, it is to be appreciated that an important component of the      performance of solar cell modules is the reliability of the bonds between      the cell contacts and the solar cell substrates, which are subject to      thermal aging and also peeling forces applied by the cell-coupling tabs      that interconnect the cells in a module. </PAR><PAR>  Prior art silicon photovoltaic cell modules incorporating silver electrical      front contacts and aluminum rear contacts with silver soldering pads, with      copper cell-coupling tabs soldered to those contacts and pads, tend to      show poor mechanical reliability of their solder bonds when subjected to      thermal aging. It has been found that the bond reliability factor is      especially critical for the grid contact. Specifically, it is known that      the strength of solder bonds made to silver/glass thick films on silicon      using 63% tin/37% lead or 62% tin/36% lead/2% silver solders degrades by      more than 80% upon exposure to temperatures of 150.degree. C. for one      hour. As noted above, exposure to such temperatures for up to one hour is      typically required to laminate the cells to glass in the manufacture of      photovoltaic modules. Consequently, the substrate/solder/tab bonds in      modules made with such solders are inherently weak. Stress testing of      modules made in this manner indicate that their performance degrades      relatively rapidly under conditions that produce mechanical loading on the      module, including changes in temperature which can be expected to occur in      typical applications. </PAR><PAR>  The literature in this field also suggests that the problem of thermal      instability of contacts with solder bonds as described above, may be      caused, at least in part, by the formation of intermetallic compounds      between tin and silver because such compounds are known to be brittle and      weak. While heating promotes formation of such components, it is believed      that they tend to form slowly even at room temperature. There has been      some belief that these brittle compounds promote the metallization failure      at low stress levels. </PAR><PAR>  Recently, it was discovered that improved contact reliability can be      achieved by bonding the copper tabs to the silver grid contacts and      soldering pads by using a solder paste with a combination of tin and      silver ranging from about 96% tin/4% silver to about 98% tin/2% silver,      with the paste preferably incorporating one or more compatible, volatile      fluxing agents. This invention is disclosed and claimed in U.S. Pat. No.      5,074,920, issued to Ronald C. Gonsiorawski et al for &quot;Photovoltaic Cells      With Improved Thermal Stability&quot;, which is incorporated herein by      reference thereto. An example of a solder selected according to the      teachings of Gonsiorawski et al is &quot;Xersin 2005&quot;, which is a solder paste      comprising approximately 96% tin and 4% silver in a synthetic flux,      manufactured by Multicore Corp., a company having United States offices in      Westbury, N.Y. To the extent necessary, the teachings of Gonsiorawski et      al U.S. Pat. No. 5,074,920 are incorporated herein by reference thereto. </PAR><PAR>  In the development of this invention, efforts were directed to determining      whether or not selected silver pastes could improve grid electrode bond      reliability. It was observed that the grid electrode bond reliability      problem was most acute in the regions where the tabs are soldered to the      bus bars of the grid contacts. A severe reduction in peel strength in      those regions was observed when the cell contacts were thermally soaked      (i.e., heated to a predetermined temperature for a measured time) and then      tested for peel strength. The thermal aging effect leading to reduced peel      strength was investigated as to the role of the solder chemistry and also      the physical and chemical properties of different silver pastes. The      investigation has lead to the belief that the failure mechanism is related      to surface diffusion of tin from the solder under the driving force of      heat. In-diffusion of tin deep into the bulk of the silver busbar is      believed to cause the busbar structure to swell, putting tensile stress on      the glass component of the busbar. Tensile stress reduces the fracture      strength of the busbar, resulting in lower contact bond peel strength. </PAR><PAR>  One result of the investigation was the discovery, disclosed by the      Gonsiorawski et al U.S. Pat. No. 5,074,920, supra, that the thermal aging      effect could be reduced by changing solder composition, since the role of      solder chemistry in the fracture mechanism is related to the eutectic      temperature of the solder. Tin surface diffusion at temperatures close to      the solder eutectic temperature is significant, causing the swelling and      weakened bonds. As disclosed in said U.S. Pat. No. 5,074,920 of Ronald C.      Gonsiorawski et al, improved temperature stability can be achieved if the      standard 62% tin/30% lead/2% silver (which has a eutectic temperature of      about 179 degrees C.) is replaced by a solder having a composition in the      range of 96% tin-4% silver to 98% tin-2% silver. The 96% tin-4% silver      solder has a eutectic temperature approximately 40 degrees C. higher than      the standard 62% tin-36% lead-2% silver solder, and this higher eutectic      temperature improves resistance to thermal aging of the contact bonds. </PAR><PAR>  A second result of the investigation is the present invention. It was      postulated that improved metallization reliability for the grid electrode      could be achieved by using a silver paste which, after being fired, would      be more resistant to in-diffusion of tin. The present invention arises      from and comprises the discovery that the form and size of the particles      in the silver paste or ink has an effect on bond stability under thermal      aging. The present invention comprises the concept that if substantially      all of the metal particles in the silver paste have a generally spherical      or round form, the reliability of the bond between the contacts and the      underlying substrate is greatly improved in the region of the solder      connections between the contacts and the tabs that interconnect adjacent      cells in a module. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECTS AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The primary object of this invention is to provide improved contacts for      solar cells. </PAR><PAR>  Another object is to provide solar cells having low resistance contacts      with solder bonds that exhibit improved resistance to thermal aging. </PAR><PAR>  Still another object is to provide an improved method of making silver      contacts and/or silver soldering tabs for solar cells which provide      improved contact stability without any loss in cell efficiency. </PAR><PAR>  A more specific object is to provide a method of making grid contacts      wherein the busbar(s) and the fingers are formed separately, preferably      with the busbar(s) being printed before the fingers. </PAR><PAR>  Another specific object of this invention is to provide an improved method      of making grid contacts using the &quot;fired through&quot; technique. </PAR><PAR>  These objects and other objects hereinafter rendered obvious are achieved      by the present invention, which consists of the discovery that it is      advantageous to make at least selected portions of the grid contacts by      use of a silver ink or paste wherein virtually all of the silver particles      have a spherical shape. In the case of grid electrodes, this ink is used      to print the busbar(s), while the same or a different ink may be used to      print the fingers. Preferably the busbar(s) and fingers are printed in two      different steps. The spherical particles provide a less porous structure      after firing, leading to improved resistance to deterioration from thermal      aging. </PAR><PAR>  Other features and advantages of the invention are specifically described      or rendered obvious in the following detailed description which is to be      considered in conjunction with the drawings hereinafter identified. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side view in elevation of a silicon substrate having a P-N      junction adjacent a first surface thereof and a dielectric anti-reflection      coating covering said first surface; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a view like FIG. 1, with one layer shown in section, showing      application of a windowed aluminum ink or paste to the silicon substrate,      with the ink or paste shown in section; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a bottom plan view of the silicon substrate showing the      configuration of the aluminum ink paste; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a view like FIG. 2 illustrating the device shown in FIG. 3 after      it has been heat treated to alloy the aluminum of the aluminum ink or      paste to the substrate; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 is a view like FIG. 2 showing how the silver soldering pads are      deposited in the window of the aluminum layer, with the aluminum and      silver pads shown in section; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a view like FIG. 5 showing how a metal ink is applied to the      front side of the same structure in the pattern of a grid electrode; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 is a plan view illustrating the configuration of the grid electrode; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a view like FIG. 6 showing the grid electrode in section after it      has been fired; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a photomicrograph of a dried but unfired silver paste comprising      silver particles in various shapes; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a photomicrograph like FIG. 9 of a dried but unfired silver      paste where virtually all of the silver particles in the paste have a      generally round form; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 11 is a photomicrograph of the top surface of a fired busbar made with      the silver paste of FIG. 9; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 12 is a photomicrograph of the top surface of a fired busbar made with      the silver paste of FIG. 10; </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 13 and 14 are photomicrographs of cross-sections of the samples of      FIGS. 11 and 12 respectively, with the sections constituting a 4 degree      section cut with a diamond wheel; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 15-18 are graphs illustrating the advantages of the invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  In the various figures, like numerals designate like parts. </PAR><PAR>  For convenience of illustration and also in order to facilitate      understanding of the invention, at least some of the components and      features illustrated in the drawings, e.g., the relative thicknesses of      the substrate and the various layers on the substrate, the depth of the      P-N junction and the N.sup.andplus;  and P.sup.andplus;  regions, the spacing and size      of the silver soldering pads and the elements of the grid electrode, and      the spacing between and the relative sizes of the openings formed in the      AR dielectric layer on the substrate, are not drawn to scale. </PAR><PAC>  SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Referring now to the drawings, the preferred embodiment of the invention is      described in relation to FIGS. 1-8 which illustrates the production of      solar cells using EFG-grown silicon in ribbon or sheet form.

Although various dielectric materials may be used as an AR coating, e.g.,      silicon nitride, titanium dioxide, and silicon dioxide, it is preferred      that the dielectric layer comprise a species of silicon nitride. </PAR><PAR>  To the extent already described, the partially finished cell may be      fabricated by various methods and means well known in the art. For      instance, junction 4 and N.sup.andplus;  conductivity region 6 may be formed in a      P-type silicon substrate 2 by the diffusion of phosphorous from a gaseous      or solid source. The silicon nitride layer 10 also may be formed in      various ways, e.g., by a plasma vapor deposition process as disclosed in      U.S. Pat. No. 4,751,191, issued Jun. 14, 1988 to Ronald C. Gonsiorawski et      al for &quot;Method Of Fabricating Solar Cells With Silicon Nitride Coating&quot; or      by diffusion from a solid source applied as a coating onto the substrate. </PAR><PAR>  Referring now to FIGS. 2-5, the first step in converting the partially      finished cell 1 to a finished solar cell comprises covering the rear side      of the substrate with a coating 12 of a paste containing aluminum      particles in an organic vehicle so that all of the rear side of the      substrate is coated except for a rectangular marginal portion 14 and a      plurality of rectangular apertures or windows 16. Apertures 16 are      arranged in parallel rows as shown in FIG. 3. Then the aluminum ink is      fired by heating the substrate in nitrogen at a temperature of from about      670 to 850 degrees C., preferably about 760 degrees C. This firing      eliminates the organic vehicle component of the aluminum ink and causes      the aluminum particles to alloy with the silicon substrate. The firing of      the aluminum ink also produces a P.sup.andplus;  region 18 (FIG. 4). </PAR><PAR>  The next step involves printing a silver paste onto the window areas so      that the paste overlaps the aluminum layer 12 by between about 0.015&quot; and      about 0.030&quot; at each side of each window. The silver paste applied to the      window areas preferably comprises a glass frit and, optionally but not      necessarily, it may contain a small amount of nickel in the form of      particles. FIG. 5 generally illustrates the cross-sectional shape of the      resulting soldering pads 20 after they have been fired as hereinafter      described, with the pads being bonded to the substrate and also      overlapping and making electrical contact with aluminum layer 12. The wet      silver paste is dried for between 1 and 20 minutes in an oven in an air or      nitrogen atmosphere heated to a temperature of about 100-150 degrees C. </PAR><PAR>  Then a silver paste (FIGS. 5 and 7) is applied onto the front side of the      substrate so as to form a coating 22 in overlying relationship with the      silicon nitride layer, with the silver paste coating being arranged so as      to define a predetermined electrode pattern comprising a pair of parallel      spaced busbars 24 and 26 and a plurality of narrow elongated fingers 28      extending between the two busbars. The fingers 28 are much narrower than      the busbars. Preferably the silver paste defining the busbars 24, 26 is      applied in a separate step preceding the application of the silver paste      that is used to form the fingers 28, with different silver inks being used      for the two steps. </PAR><PAR>  Application of the paste(s) forming the grid pattern may be accomplished      using any of the known printing techniques which are commonly used in the      electronics industry, including screen printing, pad printing and direct      writing. Preferably, however, the grid-defining layer 22 is applied by the      direct writing technique in two separate steps. The paste(s) forming layer      22 is preferably dried for between 1 and 20 minutes in an air or nitrogen      atmosphere at a temperature between about 100 and 150 degrees C. </PAR><PAR>  Thereafter the entire assembly is fired so that simultaneously (1) the      silver paste(s) forming the coating that defines the grid electrode      pattern 22 will pass through the silicon nitride and the sintered silver      particles will form an ohmic contact with the underlying upper surface of      the substrate, and (2) the silver particles in the paste forming the      soldering pads 20 are sintered and bonded to the silicon substrate. Firing      of the silver paste coating that defines the front grid contact pattern      and the silver paste that makes up the pattern of the soldering pads 20 is      conducted in an infra-red furnace with an air or oxygen-containing      atmosphere at a temperature between about 750 and about 850 degrees C. The      firing temperature and time may vary, but in any case the firing      temperature and time must be adequate to volatilize or pyrolyze or      otherwise remove the organic constituents of the silver pastes and melt      the glass frit in silver paste coating 22 until that coating passes      through the silicon nitride layer and forms an ohmic bond to the      underlying substrate. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 shows how the finger portions 28 of the coating 22 extend through      the silicon nitride layer 10 after being fired as above described. </PAR><PAR>  After the firing step, solder is deposited on the bus bars 24, 26 at a      plurality of mutually-spaced points and also on each of the silver      soldering pads 20. Then, as illustrated in dotted lines in FIGS. 7 and 3,      copper tabs 52, 54, 56, and 58 are secured to busbars 24, 26 and soldering      tabs 20, respectively by heating and reflowing the deposited solder. </PAR><PAR>  Various silver inks have been used in manufacturing solar cells. See, for      example, copending U.S. application Ser. No. 561,101, of Frank Bottari et      al, supra, copending U.S. application Ser. No. 586,894, filed 24 Sep. 1990      by David A. St. Angelo et al for &quot;Electrical Contacts And Method Of      Manufacturing Same&quot;, now U.S. Pat. No. 5,118,362; and copending U.S.      application Ser. No. 666,334, filed 7 Mar. 1991 by Jack I. Hanoka et al      for &quot;Method And Apparatus For Forming Contacts&quot; for various ink      compositions. </PAR><PAR>  A commonly used silver ink is the one manufactured by the Ferro Electronics      Division of Ferro Corp., located in Santa Barbara, Calif., under the      designation &quot;Conductrox 3349&quot;. It comprises by weight 45-80% silver      particles, 1-5% lead borosilicate glass frit and an organic vehicle      comprising 10-30% diethyleneglycol monobutyl ether and 1-5% ethylene      glycol monomethyl ether. The silver particles are mostly in the form of      large, oddly shaped flakes. This particular ink offers the benefit that it      does not detract from cell efficiency. However, it also appears to suffer      from the effect of tin in-diffusion resulting from thermal aging, with the      result that contact reliability (as measured by peel strength tests      following a thermal soaking step) is degraded by thermal aging. </PAR><PAR>  Prior work has shown that the firing of silver front contacts on solar      cells using a conventional paste such as Ferro Conductrox 3349 is      preferably accomplished by a so-called &quot;rapid spike firing&quot;, in which a      substrate coated with the silver/glass frit paste is subjected to a firing      temperature of between about 750 and 850 degrees C. (which is below the      melting point of silver) for a time which is long enough for the molten      glass to penetrate the silicon nitride AR coating but short enough to      avoid silver penetration of the P-N junction. Such a firing procedure      assures a low resistance ohmic contact with the substrate. However, it      appears that the rapid spike firing does not give the silver particles of      the Ferro 3349 ink enough time to sinter fully, since the firing      temperature is kept below the melting point of silver to assure a low      resistance contact and also to avoid penetration of the P-N junction;      consequently solidification of the silver particles into a conductive      matrix occurs via liquid-assisted solid-phase sintering an is relatively      slow. As noted above, the silver particles in the Ferro Conductrox 3349      paste are predominantly relatively large, oddly shaped flakes. It has been      found that they sinter slowly because the large, oddly shaped flakes do      not fit well together. The incomplete sintering is reflected in the fact      that the fired Ferro Conductrox 3349 ink has a porous, voided structure as      shown in FIG. 11. This porous structure is believed to facilitate      diffusion of tin from the solder into the contact, resulting in a reduced      reliability due to thermal aging. </PAR><PAR>  In contrast, silver spheres in a silver/glass frit paste sinter more      rapidly at a temperature in the order of 790 degrees C., with the rate      increasing as the particle size decreases. The generally spherical or      globular particles will fit together better than oddly shaped flakes and,      therefore, the ink with spherical particles will produce a less porous      contact that offers more resistance to in-diffusion of tin and hence has      greater reliability. At the same time, the electrical efficiency of the      resultant cells is at least equal to that of cells made with silver inks      having silver particles that are predominantly non-spherical in shape. A      suitable ink containing predominantly spherical particles is available      from Ferro Corp. under the designation Ferro FX 33-069. It is believed      that the spherical particles in the 33-069 ink have a maximum particle      size of about 5.0 microns. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 9 and 10 are photomicrographs comparing the nature of the particles      in the Ferro Conductrox 3349 ink and the Ferro FX 33-069 ink in dried but      unfired form. As seen in FIG. 9, the Ferro Conductrox 3349 ink comprises      relatively large particles having odd or different shapes and sizes. In      contrast, FIG. 10 shows that most or substantially all of the silver      particles in the unfired Ferro FX 33-069 ink are round, i.e., they have a      generally spherical shape. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 11 and 12 are photomicrographs comparing fired busbars made with the      Ferro Conductrox 3349 ink and the Ferro FX 33-069 ink, respectively. In      both cases, the inks were fired under essentially identical conditions to      a peak temperature of about 790 degrees C. for about 5-10 seconds. FIG. 11      illustrates that the fired Ferro 3349 ink provides an obviously voided      structure with large crevices and openings. The same kind of voided      structure is less evident in FIG. 12. The voids are randomly spaced in      both photomicrographs. With reference to FIGS. 13 and 14, the dark areas      represent voids in the bulk of the busbar, and it is obvious that the      population of voids is greater using the Ferro Conductrox 3349 ink (FIG.      13) in comparison with the Ferro FX 33-069 ink (FIG. 14). </PAR><PAR>  Since smaller particles are more rapidly sintered and more easily      concentrated or packed, it is preferred that the spherical silver      particles be relatively small, with the size ranging from about 0.5 to      about 10.0 microns, preferably in the range of 1.0 to 2.0 microns. Having      silver particles below 0.5 microns in diameter is to be avoided since it      has been found that the silver sintering occurs too rapidly to permit      complete penetration of the silicon nitride layer by the molten glass of      the silver ink or paste. </PAR><PAR>  It has been determined that a paste with generally spherical (globular)      silver particles should be dried before firing in order to improve      results. Since sintering of the silver spheres occurs rapidly, if the      solvents constituting the vehicle are not substantially fully removed      before firing, solvents trapped in the bulk of the printed busbar may      burst through the solidified surface of the busbar during firing. Such      escape of trapped solvent tends to adversely affect the continuity of the      busbar and/or the electrical properties of the cell. </PAR><PAR>  The present invention is preferably practiced by printing the grid      electrode pattern on the silicon nitride in two discrete phases. In the      first phase, a silver-rich ink wherein substantially all of the silver is      in the form of spherical or non-spherical particles is printed onto the      silicon nitride so as to define at least one and preferably two busbars      patterns. In the second phase, the same or a different ink is printed onto      the silicon nitride so as to define a pattern of fingers that intersect      the bus bar pattern. Both ink patterns are then fired simultaneously so as      to cause the molten glass frit component to dissolve the underlying      silicon nitride and cause liquid-assisted solid-phase sintering of the      silver particles and bonding to the silicon substrate. </PAR><PAR>  For a better understanding of the present invention, the following example      is presented. For convenience of understanding and not by way of      restriction, the following example is described with reference to FIGS.      1-8. This example should in no way be construed as limiting the field or      scope of this invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  Photovoltaic solar cell substrates 2 were provided in the form of      polycrystalline EFG-grown silicon sheets or plates measuring approximately      3.78 inches long by approximately 3.78 inches wide, and having a thickness      of approximately 15 mils. The sheets had a shallow P-N junction formed      therein at a depth of about 0.5 microns below their front surfaces. The      substrates also comprised a silicon nitride AR coating 10 on their front      surfaces having a thickness of about 800 Angstroms and a fired aluminum      rear contact 12 on their rear surfaces. The aluminum contact was formed by      use of an aluminum/glass frit screen printing ink manufactured by Electro      Science Labs under the product code &quot;ESL No. 2592&quot;. The fired aluminum      contacts had a thickness of about 8 microns characterized by a plurality      of windows 16 measuring approximately 80.times.120 mils arranged      symmetrically in parallel rows. </PAR><PAR>  These substrates were first treated by filling the windows 16 with a      coating of DuPont 4942D silver/glass frit paste with spherical silver      particles to a thickness of about 45 microns. That paste comprised an      organic vehicle in which the silver particles and glass frit were      dispersed. The windows were filled so that the paste overlapped the      surrounding aluminum contact by about 20 mils. Thereafter, the DuPont      4942D paste in windows 16 was dried at a temperature of about 150-200      degrees C. for about 3 minutes. </PAR><PAR>  Next, formation of the front grid contact was conducted in two distinct      phases or steps. One at a time solar cell substrates as above described      were mounted in a direct writing machine, e.g., a &quot;Micropen&quot;  direct      writing machine manufactured by Micropen, Inc. of Pittsford, N.Y., USA,      and the latter was operated at room temperature (approximately 25 degrees      C.) using the Ferro FX 33-069 silver/glass frit ink so as to write two bus      bars as shown at 24 and 26 on the silicon nitride coating covering the      front surface of the substrates. The busbar were formed with a width of      about 0.045 inch and a thickness of about 20 microns in their as-written      state. </PAR><PAR>  Then, without any intervening drying step, each solar cell substrate was      mounted in a second direct writing machine and the latter was operated at      room temperature using the Ferro Conductrox 3349 ink so as to write      fingers as shown at 28 that intersect the written busbars. The resulting      finger elements had a width of about 0.008 to 0.010 inch and a thickness      of about 20 microns in their as-written state. </PAR><PAR>  Then the solar cell blanks were dried in air at about 150-200 degrees C.      for about 3 minutes. Thereafter the blanks were fired for three minutes in      an infra-red furnace, in an air ambient atmosphere. The temperature of the      blanks was ramped up from 200.degree. C. to a peak temperature of about      790 degrees C. and ramped back down to 200.degree. C. The blanks are held      at the peak temperature of about 790.degree. C. for about 5 seconds. The      firing caused the silver ink defining the bus bars 24, 26 and the finger      elements 28 to dissolve the underlying silicon nitride layer so that the      silver component of the fired ink formed an ohmic contact with the silicon      substrate. Simultaneously, the DuPont 4942D ink in windows 16 was      converted to silver pads 20. The silver particles of the Ferro FX 33-069,      Ferro Conductrox 3349, and DuPont 4942D inks were sintered during the      firing. The fired busbars had a width of about 0.045 inch and a height of      about 15 microns, while the fired fingers had a width of about 0.008 inch      and a height of 15 microns. The fired silver soldering pads 20 had a      thickness of about 40 microns. Subsequently, copper strips 52 and 54 were      soldered to the busbars. This was done by first depositing 96 tin/4 silver      Xersin 2005 solder paste manufactured by Multicore Corporation at four      separate sites on each bus bar at ambient temperature, i.e., 25 degrees C.      The solder paste was then heated in situ by the use of jets of hot air      long enough so as to cause it to reflow and resolidify. During the heating      process, the &quot;Xersin 2005&quot; fluxing agent, which is believed to be      primarily pentaerythritoltetrabenzoate (&quot;Pentoate&quot;), was driven off and      the metallic components of the solder were fused to the silver busbars and      the copper conductors 52 and 54. Thereafter the cells were subjected to      measurement of their electrical properties and compared with other cells      made according to the same procedures and conditions except that their      busbars were made using the Ferro Conductrox 3349 silver/glass frit ink.      Additional comparative tests were conducted with respect to thermal      degration resulting from thermal soaking, as reflected by the results of      subsequent peel strength tests. </PAR><PAR>  Table 1 is a comparison of the electrical properties of two batches of      cells made according to the procedure described above, one batch of 5      cells having grid contacts with busbars made using the Ferro 33-069 ink      and a second batch of 20 cells having busbars made using the Ferro 3349      silver ink. In each case the fired busbars had a width of approximately 44      mils and a thickness of about 15 micrometers. The cells made with busbars      made from the Ferro 33-069 paste had efficiencies equivalent to those made      with grid electrodes using solely the Ferro 3349 paste. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 1                                                          ______________________________________                                                                                    P                                   Busbar                                                                               No. of  J.sub.rv  V.sub.oc                                                                             J.sub.sc     (mW/                                Ink   Cells   (mA/cm.sup.2)                                                                            (mV)  (mA/cm.sup.2)                                                                          FF   cm.sup.2)                           ______________________________________                                         3349  51      .54       576   28.09   .724 11.72                               33-069                                                                               56      .34       576   28.13   .741 12.01                               ______________________________________                                     </TBL><PAR>  Tables 2 and 3 provide comparisons of the peel strengths of busbars bonded      to copper tabs using the 96% tin/4% silver solder mentioned above, with      Table 2 relating to cells with busbars made from the Ferro 33-069 paste      and Table 3 relating to cells with busbars made using the Ferro 3349      silver ink. The same process conditions were followed in making the      AR-coated solar cell substrates, forming and firing the front and back      contacts, and soldering the tabs to the busbars. However, the cells used      in the Table 2 tests had busbars with a thickness of about 11 microns and      a width of about 44 mils before firing, while the cells used in the Table      3 tests had busbars with a thickness of about 16.5 microns with a width of      about 44 mils. Each cell had four solder bonds per busbar. Different      groups of cells were heated soaked at temperatures of 135, 150 and 165      degrees C. for different times, at the end of which they were subjected to      peel strength tests conducted on each bond. A comparison of Tables 2 and 3      clearly demonstrates that the peel strengths are substantially improved      when the busbars are made using a silver/glass frit paste having spherical      silver particles. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE 2                                                          ______________________________________                                         SUMMARY OF HOT AIR SOLDER REFLOW                                               BOND PERFORMANCE (Ferro 33-069 Silver Paste)                                              PEEL STRENGTH                                                       NO.

FIGS. 15 and 16 compare the effect      of temperature on the peel strength, with thermal degradation being      greater at a thermal soaking temperature of 165 degrees C. than it is at      135 degrees C. In both figures the loss of peel strength under heat was      more pronounced for busbars made from the Ferro 3349 paste; in FIGS. 17      and 18 the spherical silver busbars showed greater resistance to bond      aging at 135 degrees C. even though their thickness was less (11 microns      Versus 16.5 microns for the non-spherical silver busbars); in FIG. 18      illustrating thermal soaking at 165 degrees C., spherical silver busbars      with thicknesses of 11 and 15 microns exhibit vastly superior resistance      to bond degradation in comparison to 16.5 microns that busbars made with      the Ferro 3349 paste. </PAR><PAR>  It is believed that Tables 1-3 and FIGS. 15 to 18 clearly illustrate that      the use of a spherical silver/glass grit paste provides a superior      metallization system for bus bar bond reliability, and that advantage is      obtained without incurring any penalty regarding fill factor or cell      efficiency. </PAR><PAR>  In the practice of this invention, the silver ink that is applied to the      substrate should contain between about 50 and 80 wt. % silver particles      and between about 2 and about 8 wt. % of a glass frit, with the remainder      of the ink consisting of an organic vehicle that can be removed by      evaporation or combustion. In the case where the aluminum ink contains no      glass frit, the concentration of aluminum particles in the ink that is      applied to the substrate preferably ranges from between about 70 and 85      wt. %, with the remainder of the ink consisting of the organic vehicle. If      the aluminum ink contains a glass frit, it should be formulated so that      when applied to the substrate it contains about 50-70 wt % aluminum      particles, 2-40 wt % glass frit, and 2-15 wt % organic vehicle. </PAR><PAR>  As noted previously, while substrate temperatures of 750-850 degrees may be      used for firing silver pastes on the front and rear sides simultaneously,      a peak substrate temperature of about 790 degrees C. is preferred for      firing the grid electrode pastes. A belt furnace is preferred for firing      the substrates. In such a furnace the conveyor belt runs at a constant      speed, but the speed at which the belt is set to run may be varied within      limits. Thus the conveyor speed may be set so that the time that each      substrate is in the furnace is in the range of about 0.25 to about 2.0      minutes, including the time required to bring the substrate up to the peak      firing temperature of 750-850 degrees C. By way of example, if the furnace      contains ambient air heated to a temperature of about 850 degrees C., the      speed of the conveyor belt is set so that the substrate reaches a peak      temperature of about 790 degrees C. and remains at that temperature for      about 5 seconds, after which it is cooled down at a selected rate. </PAR><PAR>  As used herein the term &quot;sintering&quot; refers to agglomerization and mutual      bonding of particles under the influence of heat. Also the term &quot;liquid      assisted solid phase sintering&quot; as used in connection with the silver      particle/glass frit pastes describes a sintering process in which the      glass frit melts below the melting point of silver, and the liquified      glass component promotes sintering of the silver particles. </PAR><PAR>  Obviously, the invention is susceptible of many modifications. Such things      as ink rheology, firing conditions, etc., may be changed without departing      from the essential character of the invention. Other silver inks also may      be used, so long as the ink used for the busbars has substantially all of      its silver particles in spherical form. Also, for example, the solar cell      blanks need not be EFG-grown substrates, but instead they may be      polycrystalline silicon material made by another crystal-growing method,      or even single crystal silicon material. </PAR><PAR>  Of course, the fingers of the grid contact and also the silver soldering      pads may be made using a paste with spherical silver particles, although      the benefit from such a paste is greatest in relation to the busbars and      the soldering pads since they are subject to in-diffusion of tin from the      solder. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be appreciated that the busbar and finger patterns could be      written on the silicon nitride layer using the same ink, or different inks      as above described. Preferably the bus bar patterns are directly written      with a silver ink Wherein substantially all of the silver particles have a      spherical or globular shape, with writing of the busbars being      accomplished using the &quot;Micropen&quot; direct writing machine, while the      fingers are written with the same or a different silver ink using the      so-called &quot;High Z&quot; direct writing technique described in co-pending U.S.      patent application Ser. No. 666,334, filed 7 Mar. 1991 by Jack I. Hanoka      et al for &quot;Method And Apparatus For Forming Contacts&quot;. It has been      determined that the &quot;High Z&quot; technique is especially suitable for writing      the fingers pattern using an ink with non-spherical silver particles,      e.g., the Ferro 3349 ink. Writing the fingers according to the &quot;High Z&quot;      technique using a silver ink wherein the silver is in the form of      spherical or globular particles is not preferred due to the tendency of      the 33-069 paste to clog the writing pen. Furthermore there is uncertainty      as to whether or not the fingers can be written with the Ferro 33-069 ink      using the &quot;Micropen&quot;  machine so as to attain as good an electrical      contact as can be obtained if the ink is the Ferro 3349 ink. </PAR><PAR>  It is to be appreciated that although it was developed for the purpose of      improving solar cell reliability, the present invention also may be used      to improve the reliability of other electronic devices that comprise fired      silver contacts, e.g., thick film silvered hybrid circuits. In this      connection the improved thermal aging resistance of contacts made      according to the present invention is especially significant in the case      of electronic devices that are required to be mounted in proximity to      other high temperature devices or systems, e.g., electronic devices with      fired silver contacts that are installed in the engine compartment of an      automobile and form part of its electronic engine-controlling circuit(s). </PAR><PAR>  Still other changes and applications are contemplated without departing      from the scope of the invention herein disclosed. Therefore, it is      intended that all matter contained in the above description or shown in      the accompanying drawings shall be interpreted in an illustrative and not      in a limiting sense. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
