(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two grade school girls, touched by theplight of children in Kuwait, sent $1 to the Kuwaiti embassy inWashington, but it was returned with the ambassador's thanks.   Melissa Davidson, 7, and her 6-year-old sister, Jessica, senttheir dollar to the embassy hoping to help children made refugeesby the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.   ``I would like to express my profound gratitude for yourgenerous gesture, which I must decline,'' wrote Ambassador SaudNasir Al-Shabah.   Al-Shabah went on to explain he was returning the dollar because``no fund has been set up for this crisis.''   Nevertheless, he wrote, ``It is your support that strengthensour hope and faith in regaining Kuwait.''   The girls chipped in 50 cents each, Melissa said.
