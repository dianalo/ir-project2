The US$1.7 million mail-in campaign will take advantage ofa government rule permitting free postage on letters to theprime minister and other members of Parliament, saving theindustry as much as US$17.4 million.</LP><TEXT>   Smokers will be asked to clip a form, which will appear incigarette packages starting next week, and mail the form toPrime Minister Brian Mulroney. The form will state, &quot;I am ofvoting age. I want you to stop the unfair taxation of tobaccoproducts in Canada. What are you going to do about it?&quot;   The campaign is intended to let the government know that&quot;smokers have had enough,&quot; said William Neville, president ofthe Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council, the industrygroup organizing the campaign. The council plans to print 50million forms.   The protest is a response to recent increases in tobaccotaxes by the Canadian and provincial governments. TheCanadian government raised tobacco sales taxes earlier thisyear by 60 Canadian cents (52 U.S. cents) to C$1.80 for apack of 20 cigarettes, the largest increase ever levied inCanada.   Several provinces also raised tobacco taxes in recentmonths. Total federal and provincial taxes make up about 75%of the retail price of cigarettes compared with about 30% inthe U.S.   A pack of 20 cigarettes has an average cost of aboutUS$4.43 in Canada. The same Canadian pack sells for aboutUS$3 in the U.S. while a U.S.-made pack sells for aboutUS$2.50 in the U.S.   Imperial Tobacco Ltd., Canada's largest manufacturer, saidthe tax increases &quot;will undoubtedly have a strong impact&quot; onthe volume of cigarettes made this year. In the first threemonths of the year, manufacturers' shipments to retailersfell 12.4% from the year-earlier period. Imperial is asubsidiary of Imasco Ltd., a Montreal holding company about40%-owned by B.A.T Industries PLC.   Canada's other major tobacco companies are RJR-MacdonaldInc. and Rothmans, Benson andamp; Hedges Inc., both of Toronto.RJR-Macdonald is owned by RJR Nabisco Inc. Rothmans, Benson andamp;Hedges is 40%-owned by Philip Morris Cos. of New York and60%-owned by Rothmans Inc. of Toronto, which in turn is71%-owned by Rothmans International PLC of Britain.   Canadian health groups estimate the increase in federaland provincial tobacco taxes will cause smoking to fall 11%per capita this year.</TEXT></DOC>
