What took years in Poland, months inHungary, and weeks in East Germany, Bulgaria, and Czechoslovakiawas accomplished in a few days in Romania.   But the country's new provisional leaders face the most complextask of any Eastern Europeans, improvising a democratic governmentfrom the ground up after inheriting the remnants of a totalitariansystem.   The revolt first stirred Dec. 15 in the western city ofTimisoara, when hundreds overcame the fear of Nicolae Ceausescu'sregime to defend an ethnic Hungarian pastor who had battled forreligious and human rights.   Inspired young workers and students took to the streets ofTimisoara to cry for bread and freedom. Their massacre, reported toRomanians by Radio Free Europe, their lifeline to each other and tothe outside world, stirred the rest of the country and sparkedunrest in several cities.   The revolution reached the vital center of the country,Bucharest, after Ceausescu returned Dec. 20 from a three-day visitto Iran. He branded the Timisoara demonstrators ``hooligans'' andorganized a rally to support his views.   ``It was when he called Romanians terrorists and hooligans thatit was enough,'' said Bogdan Lazaroae, a 21-year-old Buchareststudent. ``We work hard for him to build his golden palaces, and hecalls us terrorists.''   Students turned the pro-Ceausescu rally into an anti-Ceausescuprotest, then held out for hours against security forces who shotat them. By the morning of Dec. 22, workers had joined thestudents, and crowds swarmed over the tanks sent to mow them down.The army _ long held down by Ceausescu and used for farming andconstruction rather than fighting _ switched sides.   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, fled their capital Dec. 22 as thefirst waves of spontaneous joy and exultation crackled throughradio and television, by then in the hands of revolutionaries.   Ion Iliescu _ who is now president _ and other revolutionaryleaders were summoned to the radio and television stations by thedemonstrators.   Once on the air, Iliescu summoned all Romanians who wanted torestore the country to attend a 5 p.m. meeting at Communist Partyheadquarters.   There, men and women who had objected to Ceausescu's rule butwere kept apart for months or years by watchful security agents metother. New voices, like Petre Roman, emerged. Roman is now thepremier.   Members of the makeshift government were forced to move aroundin armored cars and shift headquarters by day. The population thatrejoiced at Ceausescu's downfall _ and with it the end of Communism_ became fearful the old system could return and afraid thatCeausescu's inheritors, many of them ex-Communists, would notembrace real democracy.   Free elections are promised for April, a schedule that seemsimpossibly hasty in a country where there have been no politics formore than 20 years.   Conservative parties banned after the Communist takeover in 1947are beginning to emerge, but, in a country where communications arepoor and radio and television are the only media reachingnationwide, it is uncertain how much national impact they can haveby April.   The governing National Salvation Committee said it is not aparty and therefore not a contender in the elections.   While adopting some of the language of democracy _ separatingits powers, for instance, from those of the government _ thecommittee and Iliescu have taken enormous power into their hands.   Acting as an ad hoc legislature, they have repealed Ceausescu'smost hated laws, opened the borders for Romanians to travel,appointed ministers and taken over the state-run media. Iliescu andhis defense minister, Gen. Nicolae Militaru, command the 180,000army troops, and have already _ without explaining why _ sacked ageneral who helped them during the revolt.   The declaratory nature of their decrees rings old-styleCommunist, even if the content is liberal, revealing how hard itwill be to overcome the stylistic remnants of Ceausescu's rule.   Dealing with the economy will pose more enormous problems forthe new government.   Pursuing a vision of a Greater Romania, Ceausescu burdened histraditionally agricultural nation with industries it did not needand could not run.   He polluted the land, air and water with his grandiose projectsand destroyed the national heritage in cities and towns forced todon the mask of his dreams for the proletariat _ towering apartmentblocks that looked modern but hid communal bathrooms and crumblingwalls.   Nothing can reconstruct the thousands of old homes and 22churches that disappeared so Ceausescu could build the Palace ofthe Republic and Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism in centralBucharest.   His self-aggrandizing visions did give Bucharest a useful, andefficient subway system. He also apparently managed to pay off theforeign debt he ran up for his own glory _ by exporting the foodhis people needed.   Western diplomats in Bucharest see the lack of debt as onepotential asset as Romania's new leaders try to rebuild the nation.   Other assets are Romania's oilfields and its scenic touristattractions. Romanians also have a flair for business and havemanaged to salvage their peasant traditions on the land that shouldbe able to feed them in abundance.</TEXT></DOC>
