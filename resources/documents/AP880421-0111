(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The trustee of PTL, who lost a battle in afederal appeals court over the ministry's right to tax-exemptstatus, says he may pursue further appeals.   A three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals inRichmond, Va., on Wednesday affirmed a decision by U.S. DistrictJudge Karen L. Henderson of Columbia.   She found that the bankruptcy court where PTL is underreorganization proceedings did not have the authority to issue apreliminary injunction preventing the IRS from lifting thetax-exempt status.   David Clark, trustee for the ministry founded by Jim and TammyBakker, said the ruling may be appealed.   ``Our hope is that we have demonstrated good faith to the IRS bythe way the place has been run and the (changes) that have beenmade to operations and integrity that they might be willing to holdoff,'' he said.   Clark made the comment after a hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court,during which Judge Rufus Reynolds approved the sale of $3.2 millionin PTL property.   Lawyers for the Fort Mill-based ministry had argued that theloss of the status could scuttle reorganization efforts.   Attorneys for the IRS said failure to revoke the status couldcost the government from $55 million to $82 million in back taxes.The agency is seeking to make the revocation retroactive to May 31,1981.   A spokesman for the IRS in Washington, Steven Pyrek, declined tocomment on the agency's next move.   In Columbia Wednesday, Reynolds approved the sale of $3.2million worth of property _ eight houses and some land in the LakeWylie area.   One of the houses belonged to Richard Dortch, once Bakker's topaide, and sold for $425,000 at an auction.   The net gain to the ministry from the sale will be nearly $2million, according to C. Edwin Allman III, an attorney for Clark.   An attorney representing a group of PTL donors said he willfile, within 30 days, a class action protesting the sale of any ofthe ministry's property.   Robert Zanesky of Westport, Conn., said the donors'contributions are worth more than all of PTL's property. ``Ourclaim will take up everything that PTL owns,'' he said.   Reynolds told the people gathered in the courtroom that he hasbeen getting telephone calls and letters supporting the return ofthe Bakkers.   ``If you've got any star preference you want to get back in, I'mnot the one. The trustee is the one to decide,'' Reynolds said.``It is not the court who employs preachers.''   Bakker, who stepped down from PTL in March 1987 amid a sex andmoney scandal, said he wrote Reynolds last week requesting a chanceto help the ministry back to financial stability.   ``What would it hurt if Jim and Tammy were given 90 days to seewhat we could do?'' Bakker said Tuesday in an interview with TheHerald of Rock Hill. ``If at the end of 90 days I had not helped,I'd be glad to walk off into the sunset.''   Bakker said he was seeking reinstatement as a minister with theAssemblies of God and is trying to arrange a meeting with membersof the North Carolina Assembly in order to ``mend fences.''   Bakker also says he still hopes to buil a $2 billion religiousresort in the desert near Coachella, Calif.   He said Wednesday that he has not been able to buy a 1,700-acresite he favors, but insisted progress is being made towarddeveloping his proposed Heritage Springs International resort,either there or elsewhere.   Coachella Mayor Frank Duran said a Texas developer is interestedin a country club project on the same land.   The planned resort would include a 1,000-room hotel, three golfcourses, recreational vehicle park, a 20,000-seat auditorium and a1,200-seat theater for religious plays. It also would include a5,000-seat television studio.   ``We need to get back on television to move things along,''Bakker said. ``It's the old question of the chicken or the egg andwhich comes first.''</TEXT></DOC>
