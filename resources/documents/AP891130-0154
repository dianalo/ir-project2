JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Environmental Protection Agency proposedtigher pollution controls Thursday on hundreds of municipal wasteincinerators, including a requirement that at least one-fourth ofall reusable garbage be recycled.   Although the EPA said the tigher standards would curtailincinerator emissions by 90 percent within five years, the proposalwas attacked immediately by environmentalists, who said the agencyshould require greater recycling.   The proposal is the first attempt by the federal government toimpose a nationwide standard on toxic chemical releases fromgarbage incineration plants, although many communities already havecurbs, some as stringent as those proposed by the EPA.   There are more than 450 garbage incinerators nationwide with 150more expected to be built over the next five years asmunicipalities increasingly turn to burning garbage as landfillspace becomes scarce.   ``This proposal will assure that municipal waste incineratorsemploy the best demonstrated technology to protect public healthand the environment by reducing air emissions and toxic ash,'' saidWilliam Rosenberg, the assistant EPA administrator for air andradiation.   Rosenberg said a final regulation is expected to be issuedwithin a year.   Federal regulations currently place restrictions only on dustemissions from the burning of garbage, although many states andlocalities have toxic pollution controls as well.   The additional pollution control equipment was estimated toamount to an added cost of about $20 a year for every householdserved by a garbage incineration plant, EPA officials said.   Many environmentalists have accused the EPA of putting too muchemphasis on incineration in dealing with the mounting garbageproblem and not giving enough attention to recycling. They arguethat even with the tighter controls some unhealthy levels of toxicair emissions will persist and the disposal of toxic ash willcontinue to pose a threat to groundwater and soil when it is buried.   Arguing that as much as 80 percent of the garbage can berecycled, consumer activist Ralph Nader called the EPA's 25 percenttarget a ``token recycling effort'' designed to ``provide a cloakof environmental legitimacy for incineration programs.'' Nader saidall burning of municipal garbage should be banned.   ``The 25 percent goal will not even begin to solve the garbagecrisis,'' added Larry Shapiro of the New York Public InterestResearch Group, another environmental organization that hascampaigned against gargage burning.   Allen Hershkowitz, an expert on solid waste issues for theNatural Resources Defense Council, called the EPA proposal ``apositive first step'' but said its recycling requirement is ``fartoo modest.''   Rosenberg said that while the EPA proposed the 25 percentrecycling target, the agency has not ruled out the possiblity thatthe percentage will be increased when a final regulation is issued.   The EPA proposal calls for air emission standards for bothexisting incinerators and for ones still on the drawing board.   It would require incinerator operators to install scrubbers andother technology that would reduce emissions of toxic metals suchas lead, cadmium, mercury, arsenic and chromium by as much as 99percent; organic chemicals such as dioxins and furans by 99percent; and acid gases such as sulfur dioxide and hydrogenchlordie by 90 to 95 percent.   The agency also would require tighter operating standards toensure optimum combustion to reduce pollution and prohibit theburning of lead-acid batteries, which are the source of anestimated 60 percent of the lead emissions and residues coming fromincinerators.</TEXT></DOC>
