Restructuring was the year's buzzword, as companies struggled to squeeze every penny of financing power out of their assets. The result was another year of unprecedented financing volume. A record $318.3 billion was raised by U.S. issuers here and abroad, almost twice 1985's $171 billion.    While it's impossible to specify how much of that was directly attributable to a restructuring of one form or another, investment bankers agree that the purchase and sale of assets, either physical or financial, accounted for a hefty share.    Robert G. Scott, head of the fixed-income syndicate at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., estimates that as much as a third of last year's financing volume stemmed from just one type of restructuring -- the buyback of high-coupon debt. Many corporations also bought back preferred stock and unwound high-coupon interest rate swaps.    The rush to roll over high-coupon debt was partly caused by tax-law changes that will make such refinancings less attractive in 1987. Declining interest rates in 1986 were another incentive. &quot;It's been a real run for the roses,&quot; Mr. Scott says.    The capital markets have been used for a multitude of other types of restructurings as well. Several types of transactions that a few years ago would have been financed privately, by banks or insurance companies, have moved into the public markets. Many acquisitions, for example, are now financed by so-called junk bonds, as are leveraged buyouts.    According to industry estimates, about 45% of the $26 billion in junk securities issued through Sept. 30 was related to acquisitions and leveraged buyouts. However, as a result of the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal on Wall Street, there is some disagreement about whether that level can be sustained. Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. is by far the biggest player in the highyield market. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating, among others, Drexel and its junk bond operation.    One of the capital markets' great advantages for acquisition financing -- the sheer size of the deals that can be done -- applies to other kinds of restructuring financing as well. Sales of receivables, which had an unglamorous reputation when done privately for small amounts, become extremely attractive when General Motors Acceptance Corp. raises $4 billion through an issue of securities backed by auto loans.    Master limited partnerships, once used to reorganize failing tax-shelter deals, also gained new respectability as sizable offerings hit the public markets last year.    The staggering size of many of the year's offerings was also, in part, a result of the restructuring boom, notes James A. Stern, co-chairman of the primary capital markets group at Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. Corporate debt and stock buybacks left investors with enormous amounts of money to invest, he explains. &quot;There's an extraordinary recycling of money,&quot; especially in the equity markets, he says.    Investment bankers predict more restructurings and a subsequent continuation of high financing levels. &quot;It's a fairly constant drumbeat of financings,&quot; says Herbert J. Bachelor, head of corporate finance at Drexel. &quot;What's potentially significant,&quot; he adds, &quot;is that there are beginning to be companies going back around through the cycle&quot; of going private, paying off debt, and returning to the public markets.    With that kind of circular movement, Mr. Bachelor says, &quot;You know you have some backlog, even when you don't have a lock on the business,&quot; just because there's so much business to be done.    Most of that business continues to be done by a handful of investment bankers, however. The top six Wall Street firms last year cornered more than 70% of the year's investment banking business.    That's because markets have become so inextricably intertwined, says Edson V. Mitchell, head of capital markets services at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. To get what seems to be a simple piece of debt business, a banker needs to be a major player in the interest rate swap, futures and options, and European markets as well. But Mr. Mitchell and others predict increasing competition from foreign banks and investment banks. Both Japanese and Swiss firms are moving aggressively into the U.S. market, Mr. Mitchell notes.    Certainly the U.S. was the place to be last year, at least for U.S. issuers. The Euromarket, which last year provided almost 30% of the money raised by U.S. issuers, this year provided only 16%.    Anthony P. Grassi, head of the corporate finance department at First Boston Corp., attributes the slump in Europe primarily to the dollar's weakness. Although increasing numbers of foreign investors are buying securities in the U.S., most of them still turn first to the Euromarket for dollar-based securities, he explains. &quot;If people don't like the dollar as much, the Euromarket gets hit first,&quot; he says.    ---            The Biggest Corporate Financings of 1986                    (In millions of dollars)    Debt    Issuer (Date)                              Amount Raised    Asset Backed Securities (Oct. 14)          $3,990.9    BCI Holdings (April 10)                     2,500.0    Occidental Petroleum (March 21)             2,477.8    CMO Trust 14 (Nov. 5)                       1,252.2    Turner Broadcasting Syst.
