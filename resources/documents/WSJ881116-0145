James (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CYR </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> KISSIMMEE, Fla.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Cray Research Inc. disclosed that an internal group is studying the possibility of building a new generation of supercomputers vastly more complex than the machines now on the company's drawing board.    In Cray's first news conference in seven years, held in conjunction with a supercomputer conference here, Chairman John A. Rollwagen disclosed that a small group at the leading supercomputer maker is exploring the possibility of using hundreds of processors, or small computers, in a new design approach. The Cray 3, scheduled for introduction next year, will have 16 processors, while the Cray 4, due in 1991, would have 64.    But Mr. Rollwagen quickly qualified his statement, adding that &quot;there are a lot of people looking at (supercomputers with huge arrays of processors) and we like to do things people aren't doing.&quot;    Company founder Seymour Cray, who now is an outside consultant and Cray's primary computer designer, seemed to further qualify Mr. Rollwagen's statement when he said in an interview following the news conference that &quot;he (Mr. Rollwagen) was a little premature. We don't have a serious effort. We're just trying to understand where other people are. I don't think Cray belongs&quot; in the competition for computers with hundreds of processors.    While other computer makers, including Control Data Corp.'s ETA Systems Inc., have said in the past that they are exploring the possibility of building highly powerful supercomputers with hundreds of processors, Cray has been mostly silent on the matter. Gary P. Smaby, an analyst with Needham andamp; Co., said yesterday's statement was Cray's first disclosure of its internal group.    The company also said there has been very strong early interest in its latest and most powerful supercomputer, a $20 million machine called the Y-MP. Mr. Rollwagen said Cray has already received six orders for Y-MP machines to be delivered in 1989. He added that the company, which had earlier indicated that it might sell about a dozen machines next year, now expects to do better than that, though he wasn't specific. &quot;There's been a tremendous interest in that machine,&quot; he said. &quot;We're excited about it, really thrilled.&quot;    The Y-MP is the first Cray to use eight central processors; Cray's largest previous models used four. Multiprocessor machines can break a complicated problem into pieces and send them to separate processors, drastically reducing solution time. Such an ability to do many calculations simultaneously makes three-dimensional modeling during the designing of airplanes, cars and other products much more sophisticated and will perhaps lead to safer designs.    The company said the number of units it makes and delivers will rise in 1989, as will the &quot;average system value.&quot; But revenue and earnings won't totally reflect the increased volume of activity because more machines will be leased than in the past, Mr. Rollwagen said. Leasing defers more of the profit from filled orders to the future, he said.    Mr. Rollwagen explained that it wasn't a matter of economics. Instead, he said, customers want to remain flexible in a period of great technological change. &quot;It pays for customers to keep their powder dry,&quot; he said.    The computer Cray is readying for introduction next, the Cray 3, is plagued by a supply shortage of gallium arsenide, Mr. Cray said. The substance is used in the ultrafast chip the machine employs. The problem must be overcome if Cray is to make enough machines to meet expected demand.    The Cray 3 manufacturing process is novel for Cray, as well. For instance, because the machine's components are so small, robots will be used to assemble the computers. Mr. Cray said it might be necessary to make the first machines by hand until the robots are working smoothly.    Mr. Rollwagen said that for the first time, Cray expects next year to spend more research and development dollars on software than on hardware. He said the company traditionally emphasizes hardware development, but it believes that significant gains in computing performance can now come as much from software breakthroughs as from hardware. </TEXT></DOC>
