These results areused to determine the range of parameters for a white dwarf accretioncolumn in which a simple steady-state bombardment solution can be found,where the dominant radiative-loss mechanism is optically thick cyclotronradiation. It is shown that for an acceptable choice of accretion parametersa bombardment solution exists with a temperature approx. 10 keV, somewhatlower than the shock temperature Tsub(s) approx. = 30 keV.</TEXT></DOC>
