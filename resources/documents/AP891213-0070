The luxury boxes held by corporatebigwigs and other VIPs ``don't pose the same safety issue that isposed by the people in the stands,'' he said.   The outburst _ witnessed by a CBS TV audience Sunday in parts ofthe country _ resulted in at least six arrests and the ejection of200 fans.   The ban was agreed to by the Philadelphia Eagles, the city and avending company at city-owned Veterans Stadium and applies to thefootball team's remaining regular-season home game and any playoffgames this year.   It remains to be decided whether the ban will continue next yearas well.   The weekend outburst during a game against the Dallas Cowboysembarrassed city and team officials. Snow and ice hit members ofthe Cowboys, Eagles cheerleaders and fans in the line of fire. Afew people were slightly hurt.   The Eagles and the city had asked Ogden-Allied Services Corp., astadium concession, to stop beer sales because they believedalcohol helped cause the outburst.   ``It was something that needed to be done,'' said Bruce Ground,general manager for Ogden-Allied.   The Eagles also banned alcohol at tailgate parties outside thestadium. Until now, beer had been sold in the first half of gamesand drinking had been tolerated at one parking lot.   The Eagles have one regular-season home game remaining, Dec. 24against the Phoenix Cardinals, but are in position to make theplayoffs.   Ogden-Allied also handles the food concessions at the NewOrleans Superdome, the Seattle Kingdome and Rich Stadium in OrchardPark, N.Y., where Ogden discontinued the sale of alcohol on Mondaynights because of fan misbehavior.</TEXT></DOC>
