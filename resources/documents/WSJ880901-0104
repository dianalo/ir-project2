The cause of the accident wasn't immediately clear. The jet crashed shortly after lift-off, coming to a halt about 1,000 feet from the end of the runway and bursting into flames. Passengers and other eyewitnesses gave conflicting accounts of what might have gone wrong, including just how high the jet got off the ground. There were 94 survivors of the flight, scheduled to go to Salt Lake City.    Regardless of the eventual findings of the cause, the timing and circumstances were particularly unfortunate for Delta. It was the second catastrophe in three years for the carrier at one of its most important hub airports. In 1985, a Delta jumbo jet, a Lockheed L-1011, crashed and took 137 lives, also at Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, in an accident that was found to involve &quot;wind shear&quot; as well as pilot error.    Just last summer, Delta suffered from a highly publicized spate of near-misses and snafus that, taken together, suggested to some that the airline had an endemic safety problem -- or perhaps just a hex.    &quot;When they had that series of close calls, they had a lot of capital in the bank with the flying public,&quot; said Cornish Hitchcock, an official of the Airline Passenger Project at the Ralph Nader organization Public Citizen. &quot;I'm not sure every other airline could have toughed that out.&quot;    Indeed, many analysts predicted that yesterday's crash wouldn't seriously hurt Delta's business. They said passengers weren't likely to view the accident as proof of a safety problem at the airline.    &quot;I would consider this an anomaly,&quot; said Edward Starkman, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. &quot;Delta is extremely well-respected on virtually every aspect of their operation.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Delta shares fell 50 cents to $46.50. Analysts attributed at least part of the drop to industry fare cutting.    By some measure, Delta's maintenance spending is low -- perhaps even the lowest in the industry. But based on a recent analysis of other safety-related factors -- including airline finances, employee attitudes, equipment condition and safety history -- Delta was rated one of the nation's safest airlines by the Aviation Safety Institute in Columbus, Ohio.    If yesterday's accident was linked to any internal weakness at Delta, the problem escaped the notice of an exhaustive internal investigation last year to see whether any of the mishaps were connected. While Delta officials cringed at jokes on the David Letterman show and from many other quarters, they genuinely began to worry whether some internal safety system had broken down. But they determined that none had.    The company's cockpit training and coordination procedures, which have been criticized by federal officials and even elsewhere in the industry, were given especially close scrutiny. They will again get a close look, this time from federal investigators, because any accident occurring so soon after takeoff raises questions about the adequacy of check-list procedures conducted in the cockpit, industry officials say.    At the scene of the crash, survivors said they were able to escape the plane by crawling out at a split in the fuselage and by going through an emergency exit over the wing. It appeared most of the deaths occurred at the rear of the plane, which was badly burned.    Jim Hammack, a 29-year-old passenger from Garland, Texas, on his way to a business meeting in Salt Lake City, said after the plane first took off, it dipped to the right and there was a loud bang on the left side. The plane then bounced off the runway three times -- the last time, skidding on its belly down the runway, fuel and flames running down the side of the plane.    &quot;I didn't think we were in too much trouble at first,&quot; he said. &quot;But when it turned nearly sideways and bounced again, I broke into a cold sweat.&quot; There was a loud bang after every bounce, he said. &quot;After the second bounce, we got pretty high up in the air,&quot; about 50 feet, he said. &quot;Then it seemed as if we lost power.&quot;    He said the airplane seemed to still have its landing gear during the first two bounces, but that it was clearly on its belly for the last bounce.    Mr. Hammack, a construction controller for Mediplex Medical Building Corp., said he had the aisle seat by the emergency door over the left wing, and was the first passenger to jump out. &quot;When I opened my door, there were flames coming down the side of the plane, over the wing,&quot; he said. &quot;There was jet fuel on the ground, but it didn't catch fire. That's the only way we made it.&quot;    Accident investigators were scheduled to arrive at the scene of the crash late yesterday afternoon. Delta officials said all three pilots aboard the jet survived. </TEXT></DOC>
