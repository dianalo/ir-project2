Just as the 36-year-old Florida lawyer embarked on theambitious start-up of a national cable network called theSci-Fi Channel, an intergalactic battle broke out overregulation of the cable industry, threatening his well-laidplans.</LP><TEXT>   To generate enough ad revenue to have a chance ofsurviving, Mr. Rubenstein must sign up cable systems reachingfive million to seven million subscribers, or about 10% ofthe cable universe, by the time the 24-hour channel beginsoperating Dec. 31.   That means persuading cable operators to give him a spacein already-crowded lineups. At the National Cable TelevisionAssociation trade show in Atlanta this week, he was competingnot only with dozens of established basic cable networks andsome recent start-ups that have major corporate backing, butalso with a host of other entrepreneurial newcomers, from theCowboy Channel to Celticvision, an Irish-American channel.   But even those who like Mr. Rubenstein's concept haveother things on their minds. &quot;I'd love to put the Sci-FiChannel on,&quot; says Marc Nathanson, chairman of Falcon CableSystems Co., based in Los Angeles, which reaches 800,000subscribers. &quot;My attitude is, put everything on -- ascience-fiction channel, a cowboy channel, an all-cartoonchannel.   &quot;But I'm very reluctant to add a preponderance of newchannels until I see what happens to rate regulation. What'sthe incentive {to increase channel capacity} if rates aregoing to be capped?&quot;   That attitude is common. Cable operators feel threatenedby the debate in Washington over reregulating the industry.Reregulation has been discussed for some time, but when a keybill was introduced in Congress last November, actionsuddenly began to look more likely. That was bad timing forMr. Rubenstein, president of the Sci-Fi Channel, who wasabout to start pitching the channel to cable operators.Though the likelihood of tough new regulations appears tohave eased in recent weeks, many cable operators aren'tinclined to commit themselves to the capital investmentnecessary to expand channel capacity until the issue isresolved.   But Mr. Rubenstein is undaunted. So far the Sci-FiChannel, based in Boca Raton, Fla., has signed up systemsserving about 1.5 million subscribers, mostly &quot;ma and pa&quot;operations with fewer than 100,000 households each, and Mr.Rubenstein says he's &quot;right on schedule&quot; in winningsubscribers. After this week's trade show, Mr. Rubensteinprojects that the channel will &quot;easily surpass&quot; the start-uptarget range for subscribers and be &quot;close to 20 millionwithin 24 months of going on the air.&quot; He adds: &quot;Cableoperators know they're going to add channels -- a biggerpackage is what adds value and cash flow.&quot;   Without the clout that Time Warner Inc. had to back thestart-up of its Comedy Channel or Viacom Inc. had for its HA]channel, Mr. Rubenstein has had to woo operators with unusualincentives. &quot;Charter affiliates&quot; get the first two years ofthe Sci-Fi Channel free -- no license fees. In addition,charter operators get stock options in the channel, 1% foreach 500,000 subscribers. Even so, most operators are takinga wait-and-see attitude.   Many cable operators are awaiting a possible mergerbetween the Comedy Channel and HA] before deciding to addeither, and other new channels have to get in line behindthose. But Mr. Rubenstein says he thinks his serviceultimately will prevail. &quot;Our idea is different,&quot; he says.&quot;We don't have to worry about keeping people laughing.&quot;   Surprisingly, Mr. Rubenstein isn't an avid science-fictionfan. But he is a methodical businessman. He and his wife andlongtime partner, Laurie S. Silvers, Sci-Fi's chief operatingofficer, parlayed a $5,000 investment in a tiny cable systemin Indiana into roughly half-ownership of a cable operationthat sold early last year for almost $30 million. Around thesame time, he also bought a UHF TV station in Orlando, Fla.The Sci-Fi Channel will either build a production facility inthe Orlando area or use existing space. Mr. Rubensteinwouldn't comment, but it's said that the channel may usestudio space owned by Walt Disney Co. or MCA Inc. inconnection with their Florida movie-studio tours.   After coming up with the idea for the channel in 1988, Mr.Rubenstein commissioned a Gallup survey, which indicated thata science-fiction channel would be &quot;at least as popular&quot; asNickelodeon and MTV for viewers ages 12 to 49. Mr. Rubensteinlikes to say that nine of the top 10 films of all time, bybox-office revenue, are in the science-fiction, fantasy orhorror genres (he includes &quot;Ghostbusters,&quot; &quot;Jaws&quot; and theIndiana Jones movies). And he's aware that there's a solidbase of fanatically loyal science-fiction fans.   The narrow niche is what will lead to success, Mr.Rubenstein believes. He points to the Lifetime channel, whichfloundered until it targeted its programming to women. TheGallup survey found that the average viewer of the Sci-FiChannel would be a male 26 1/2 years old. Poll in hand, Mr.Rubenstein will try to sell ads for athletic shoes, cars andhigh-tech goods.   He's reserved satellite space and designed a logo. He'salso hired a cable broker, Waller Capital Corp., to help woocable systems, and an investment banker, Shearson LehmanHutton Inc., to raise capital. Mr. Rubenstein figures it willcost about $20 million to launch the channel, plus another$30 million in operating costs over the next three to fouryears before the channel becomes profitable.   Much of the expense will come from producing and acquiringprogramming. Some obvious targets, such as ParamountCommunications Inc.'s two syndicated &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, aresimply too expensive for the Sci-Fi Channel at this stage.Mr. Rubenstein says he's negotiating for rights to a numberof other old films and television series. He says he'sinterested in the mid-1960s science-fiction anthology &quot;TheOuter Limits,&quot; and also in many little-remembered series,such as ABC's late-1960s &quot;The Invaders&quot; with Roy Thinnes.   Horror will be a small part of Sci-Fi's programming, butmainly late at night and even then more in the nature of oldBoris Karloff movies (many of which are in the public domain)than current slasher films. A &quot;Haunted House&quot; game show forkids is planned.   The channel has announced a number of original programs --most notably &quot;Isaac Asimov's Universe,&quot; for which Mr. Asimovhas created a robot detective character -- and dramatizationsof science-fiction and horror stories through an arrangementwith Bertelsmann AG's Bantam Doubleday Dell Publishing GroupInc.   Other programs fall more into the lowcost talk-show genre,such as &quot;The Software Show&quot; (computer news, mostly suppliedby software companies) and &quot;The Comic Book Show&quot; (inconjunction with a big comic-book publisher). Mr. Rubensteinalso says he's exploring production partnerships with majorstudios.   Meanwhile, Mr. Rubenstein's main task is keeping thechannel in the public eye. In Atlanta, he held a newsconference to announce a tie-in with Omni magazine, in whichthe companies will trade ads and Omni will sponsor Sci-Fi'sseries on the U.S. space program. A public-relations firm isissuing blizzards of news releases on the network, and Mr.Rubenstein has bought ads in trade publications in an effortto keep the industry buzzing. One of his early moves was tosign up Mr. Asimov as an adviser and spokesman.   On paper, the Sci-Fi Channel makes a certain amount ofsense. &quot;Of all the concepts I've seen, this is the mostthoughtfully worked out,&quot; says cable analyst Larry Gerbrandtof Paul Kagan Associates, Monterey, Calif. But Mr. Gerbrandtcautions that the channel's timing is unfortunate, and&quot;they've got to hope for a break in the market.&quot;   Still, he adds: &quot;The industry is full of channels thatstarted out this way.&quot;   ---               Trying to Find Room on Cable                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               SUBSCRIBERS  NETWORK         LAUNCH DATE   (In millions) PROGRAMMING                                                                                                        Comedy Channel   November 1989      7.3      Comedy                                                                                                        Mizlou Sports News Network     February 1990      6        Sports news                                                                                                        HA]: The TV Comedy Network   April 1990         5        Comedy                                                                                                        International                                Foreign Channel          July 1990          -        language                                                                                                                                                     Live courtroom In Court         September 1990     -        proceedings                                                                                                        Cowboy Channel   November 1990      -        Western                                                                                                                                                     Sciene fiction                                              horror and Sci-Fi Channel   December 1990      -        fantasy                                                                                                        Celticvision     Spring 1991        -        Irish-American                                                                                                        Amer.
