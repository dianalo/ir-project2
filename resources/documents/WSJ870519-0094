Analysts had expected the action because ATandamp;T's plan reflects a cut in the access charges all long-distance companies must pay local telephone companies for completing calls.    MCI said its prices would drop Aug. 1; access charges decline for all companies July 1.    A spokesman for Washington-based MCI, the nation's second-largest long-distance company, said it is able to match the full ATandamp;T cut because it will &quot;receive close to the full benefit&quot; of the lower access charges.    Previously, when access charges have dropped, MCI's costs haven't declined as much as ATandamp;T's. MCI previously didn't have the same kind of access as ATandamp;T to the networks operated by local phone companies.    As a result, MCI's prices have dropped less than ATandamp;T's, which also has depressed its price advantage.    The latest price cut, while lower than previous rounds of industrywide actions, is expected to put more pressure on MCI by slowing its revenue growth. MCI had already been expecting its second and third quarters to be difficult because of a 9% price reduction it initiated March 1.    &quot;No rate cut is what they'd like to see,&quot; said Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. &quot;But this cut is more manageable than past cuts.&quot;    However, analysts said MCI might cut its prices further, if ATandamp;T is required by the Federal Communications Commission to take into consideration taxes and other factors, and thus reduce rates more than already proposed.    The MCI spokesman acknowledged that further ATandamp;T cuts were possible but declined to speculate on how MCI might respond. He said, however, that MCI decided not to wait for the FCC action.    &quot;We thought it was important to indicate that we will match ATandamp;T. . . . It's better to be aggressive.&quot;    Indeed, some analysts said MCI's move reflects conditions in the highly competitive long-distance market.    &quot;I think it says more about US Sprint than anything else,&quot; said Michael Kennedy, an analyst at Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn. &quot;Sprint has been more aggressive than MCI in discounting.&quot;    US Sprint Communications Co., a joint venture between GTE Corp., Stamford, and United Telecommunications Inc., Kansas City, Mo., has also been racking up huge losses in its effort to woo customers.    Like ATandamp;T, MCI said its rate cuts would apply to its direct-dialed service, its credit cards and two discount plans aimed primarily at small to medium-sized businesses.    MCI didn't say how much its planned cuts would reduce revenue, which in 1986 totaled $3.59 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
