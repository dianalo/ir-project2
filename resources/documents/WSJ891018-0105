Is such a view justified? In the absence of humans, would the Earth enjoy a constant climate over the long term?    Clearly not. About 20,000 years ago the last ice age ended. Enormous ice sheets retreated from the face of North America, northern Europe and Asia. This global warming must have been entirely natural -- nobody would blame it on a few hundred thousand hunter-gatherers hunting mammoths and scratching around in caves. Furthermore, no bell has yet rung to announce the end of this immense episode of natural global warming. It is probably continuing and may well account for most of, or all of, present-day global warming.    I bow to no one in my regard for our terrestrial heritage, but if we are serious about global warming we must look at the big picture and not allow the Dominant Culture to lock us into the capitalist-exploiters-greedy-American-consumers-global- warming scenario as the sole model for discussion.
