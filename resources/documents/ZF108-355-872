 It's an easy-to-use product.andM;Traditionally, the cost of accounting software has been extravagant, and as aresult those approaching the task of computerizing their accounts treat theprocess very seriously.andP;  However, since Alan Sugar let loose his Amstrad PCand Sagesoft released its accounts software to match, times have changed.andM;Now, it's possible to walk in to a small computer store and come away with acomputer and an accounting package for as little as 600 pounds.andP;  Yet, you canstill spend that much on a single module.andP;  What's the real difference?andM;In the pages that follow, we're going to be looking at four programs thatreflect the movement in the mainstream accounting market and examining thevarious strengths and weaknesses of budget, mid-range and high-end accountingofferings.andM;The products reviewed are Pegasus single-user, a product which virtuallydominates the mid-range; Accsys Accounts, a new arrival which addresses thesame market; Sage Accountant Plus, a product which practically governs thebudget scene and is the subject of a very recent new release; and EasifactsAccounts, which is distinctive for its portability across a number ofoperating systems.andM;First, some background.andP;  Although lower prices can only be good news in thelong run, the initial wave of budget mania has produced an unhealthyside-effect -- a sort of do-it-yourself attitude towards computerizing theaccounts department.andM;This is dangerous stuff.andP;  There'll always be those who presume that justbecause the product comes shrink-wrapped off the shelf, it's idiot proof.andP;  Itisn't, and to think otherwise is a recipe for disaster.andM;On the other hand, there are those who prefer to ignore the fact that budgetsoftware even exists, and who still confront the entire exercise with aphilosophy that says 'the more you spend the more you get'.andP;  It's not thatthese people have unlimited capital, it's just that they anticipate the wholething to be an extremely costly and daunting exercise.andP;  It's not anunreasonable assumption, but it needn't necessarily happen that way.andM;What's really happening is that budget programs are taking their innovationand ease of use up in to the mid-range market, and more sophisticatedprograms are trying to temper their functionality with friendlier front-ends.andM;As a result, there's now a diminishing but healthy budget sector, pushing notquite cheap but still capable accounting software.andP;  Then there's theconventional top-of-the-range accounting suites, which still mostly look verydour and overpriced.andP;  Meeting in the middle -- and making life even morecomplicated -- modern budget ease-of-use packages are gradually permeatingupwards, and traditional top-of-the-range packages are migrating downwards.andM;Before we continue, there's another point worth mentioning.andP;  How do youdecide whether or not you need any form of computerized accounting system atall?andP;  Sometimes, so little accounting activity goes on, that all the fussassociated with a typical ledger-based installation really isn't justified.andM;If that's the case, it may be possible to dig out the spreadsheet and make itlook just like your manual cashbook.andP;  Although that does save toalling up thecolumns, it's hardly very easy to use, especially compared to software that'sbeen specifically designed to do the job.andP;  After all, spreadsheets are reallygiant calculators and are ideal for the analysis of data.andP;  However, they'renot so great for banging out a daily diet of invoices.andM;Difficult to categorize, but slightly more useful than a spreadsheet in thesecircumstances, is the personal banking system.andP;  Typically this is a singleentry program for keeping track of your ins and outs, and is really designedfor private use -- although it can usually be put to work in a small businessenvironment.andM;There are numerous incarnations of this particular type of program, butperhaps one of the best for business use is Money Manager which costs around49.95 pounds -- mostly because the program also offers a limited VATreporting facility.andM;Personal banking systems became very popular around the same time as theFilofax boom reached its climax.andP;  The novelty soon wore off, however, and Ifear there are personal banking programs up and down the country which havebeen pensioned off -- rather like so many personal organizers.andM;Although both spreadsheets and personal banking systems have their uses, inmost cases the real alternative to full-blown ledgers is the computerizedcashbook.andM;This kind of program will deal with noncredit transactions in a very similarfashion to its manual computerpart and it's therefore likely to be easier fornew users to learn.andM;For those enterprises which deal mainly with cash at the point of sale, thecashbook is ideal and there are even computerized versions of popular manualsystems to choose from.andM;Micro Simplex Cashbook at a typical 115 pounds is a workable example, but thenew Freeway Cashbook 4 is a far friendlier package.andP;  Being shareware thislittle program will only set you back around 35 pounds -- including printeddocumentation and registration.andM;That's definitely at the extreme end of the scale, however, and for amainstream package you can expect to pay well over 1,000 pounds for amid-range accounting suite -- or under 300 pounds for its budget equivalent.andO;Or is that just how it seems?andM;Read on as we examine the relative strengths and weaknesses of fourrepresentative packages: Easifacts Accounts, Sage Sterling Accounts Plus,Pegasus and Accsys.andM;PegasusandM;Pegasus, like many of its peers in the mid-range sector, operates in amodular fashion.andP;  The sales, purchase and nominal ledgers with invoicing andstock control can be compared fairly with the two budget packages reviewedhere, so I'll concentrate on these.andM;Each ledger can be bought separately, and will operate independently untilyou're fully ready to integrate.andP;  This makes it attractive to companies whowant partial integration -- which larger companies often do.andM;The Pegasus sales and purchase ledgers are pretty standard issue.andP;  Both offera mixture of either open item and balance forward accounting, with theaddition of surcharge interest on overdue debts.andM;Unusually, the Pegasus sales ledger offers part payment of outstandinginvoices, but the purchase ledger doesn't.andM;This limitation doesn't apply to the more expensive Pegasus Senior -- butthen the price difference is substantial.andP;  (This will vary from dealer todealer depending on the support, training and other services on offer.)andM;The program now actually allows you to select account codes using search andscroll function keys -- and being able to skip backwards and forwards throughthe records in the entry field itself is a major improvement on previousversions which offered nothing like this.andP;  It's hardly as pretty -- or asuseful -- as the pop-up selection window offered by Sage, however!andM;There aren't any cashbook posting facilities featured in the nominal ledgerand all entries in this department consist of debit and credit double-entryjournals.andM;There's a very useful bank reconcillation routine, though, which allows,on-screen allocation of outstanding items and lets you print a statement whenyou've finished.andP;  Auto-reversing accruals and prepayments are also cateredfor, although there's no way to compile a standing list.andM;Pegasus invoicing includes sales order processing, plus fully user-definabledocument layouts which offer plenty of scope for invention -- although you'relimited to just the one.andP;  Stock control offers a choice of average or latestcost valuation, with plenty of reports giving full dominion over bothfinancial and administrative areas.andM;If stock control sounds far too sophisticated for your company (perhapsyou're mainly service-oriented) you can use a product file instead -- whichis handy for looking up prices if nothing else.andM;Pegasus is looking better than it used to.andP;  It now supports colour properlyand offers help in finding account codes for the first time -- it could evenbe due for a comeback.andP;  Extra modules to those reviewed here include jobcosting, bill of materials, payroll and retail accounting.andP;  Like all modularsystems, Pegasus' main advantage is its expandability.andM;Accsys AccountsandM;Like Pegasus, the Accsys Accounts package can be bought module by module ifrequired, and at present totals seven applications.andP;  Here again, I'll belooking specifically at the sales, purchase, and nominal ledgers withinvoicing and stock control.andM;Perhaps the main feature offered by Accsys is its portability across variousoperating systems and environments.andP;  The supplier makes a point of thiscompatibility, not only with DOS, but also Concurrent DOS, SCO Xenix, Unixand VMS.andM;Unfortunately, the result is apparent when you first load the program: plainvanilla ASCII text screens are all you get.andP;  That's the price you pay forportability -- since fancy graphics are unlikely to be supported on standardremote terminals which are the lowest common denominator.andM;The solution, of course, is to market several different products -- likeFacts Software does in the case of its Multifacts and Easifacts Accountspackages.andM;Presentation aside, Accsys is a comprehensive package.andP;  Open item and broughtforward balance accounts can be mixed on the same ledger, with sophisticateddiscount facilities catering for most situations.andM;Payments can be analysed across multiple bank accounts, with flexible cashallocation covering discounts, part payments and automatic payment of theoldest debt.andM;You can even write off the difference between the amount received and theoutstanding invoice, often useful for those odd pennies that would otherwiserequire special attention later.andM;The nominal ledger does feature cashbook and petty cash transactions, as wellas the more typical journal routines.andP;  Like Pegasus, bank reconciliation isalso a feature, being a matter of marking transactions on-screen until thecorrect balance is achieved.andP;  You find this facility much more often inmid-range systems now, but it's still sadly lacking throughout the budgetsector as a whole.andM;Accsys also offers search and scroll facilities, the idea being that, ratherlike a database, you can enter a few characters of the account name if youcan't remember the code.andM;Like the Easifacts program (see page 52) proformas are an option on theAccsys invoicing menu, and once printed they're removed from the system.andP;  Upto 99 user-definable layouts are available and Accsys supplies a formsgenerator specifically for that purpose.andM;The actual design process is very similar to that employed by Sage and worksrather like the 'paint-a-screen' approach used in databases.andM;First In, First Out stock control identifies Accsys as a serious contenderfor companies with a fast appreciating product turnover.andP;  The system managesup to four different price bands, keeping details of costs and quantities foreach.andM;Although it's about par for the course in most respects, this system doeshave one other useful and noteworthy feature.andM;When posting goods received you can enter the supplier's part number forreference instead of your own code, and the correct product will beidentified by either.andP;  This facility is extremely useful, since thesupplier's stock code is often available from the delivery docket, while yourown reference is very rarely to hand.andM;Accsys Accounts offers a high degree of functionality, with extra utilitieslike sophisticated system user and password management, well implementedspooler and an amazing report generator -- although the report generatorcosts extra.andP;  The user interface, however, is appalling by budget standards,and generally gives you the impression that the system is a bit of a beast.andM;Sage Accountant PlusandM;With the release of its new Sterling range, Sage is obviously after potentialPegasus buyers -- especially when you consider that at the same time asmaking numerous enhancements, the company has put the price up from 199pounds to 399 pounds.andM;This particular package offers integrated sales, purchase and nominalledgers, with stock control and invoicing thrown in for good measure.andP;  To getthe sort of sales order processing offered by the Pegasus invoicing module,you'll have to pay another 100 pounds for Financial Controller.andM;Accountant Plus, like many budget programs, is a real-time integrated system,so although you can simply ignore the bits you don't want to use, postingsacross the ledgers will be made regardless.andP;  The program operates on anopen-item basis.andP;  Unlike Pegasus, however, it can't handle balance broughtforward and open item accounts in the same ledger.andM;As far as ease of use is concerned, Sage rates highly among any of the budgetor mid-range products currently on offer.andP;  During cash allocation, forexample, you simply select the invoice you want paid from a scrolling list oftransactions, using the highlighted cursor bar.andP;  You can choose full or partpayment or discount by pressing Return.andM;There's just a little fly in the ointment, however.andP;  Although part paymentsare allowed, they can't include a discount amount -- no good for builders'retention.andM;Sagesoft is now well known for its intuitive user interface, which includesshadowed boxes and pop-up account code selection windows.andP;  But the newSterling product also offers a number of more serious improvements tofunctionality.andM;Refunds, bad debts and other write-offs are all available from the menu, withcontras between sales and purchase accounts made especially easy by a splitscreen routine -- one invoice is simply offset against another.andM;The nominal ledger features the full cashbook and petty cashbook postingsthat Pegasus lacks, and these are now joined by automatic depreciationroutines, recurring journals and bank payments.andM;Accruals and prepayments are also catered for, and Accountant Plusautomatically posts the appropriate journals from a list of accounts toeffect at each period end.andM;Accountant Plus allows you to choose free text as well as stock lineinvoices, which is great for the service business, and any number ofindividual user-defined layouts for these and stock items can be kept onfile.andM;Sage operates the save, print and post method of sales invoice production,and this works well.andP;  You can create all your invoices and then print them ata more convenient time if required, and the program even allows you to recalland amend a document -- until it's posted.andM;Sage has produced a winner with its new Sterling Accountant Plus, butalthough its functionality has improved immensely, the price increase doesleave a hole in the market.andP;  However, this is already being filled by thefinal product reviewed here -- Easifacts Accounts.andM;Easifacts AccountsandM;Like Accountant Plus, the Easifacts Accounts program consists of integratedsales, purchase and nominal ledgers with invoicing and stock controlincluded.andP;  Again, it offers full open item accounting in the sales andpurchase ledgers, with fully paid transactions cleared by operator request.andM;Unusually, each individual account inthe nominal ledger not only operates inan open item capacity, but also has the choice of brought forward balance ifrequired -- which is handy for clearing down those overburdened controlaccounts.andM;Although Easifacts doesn't sport Sage's multiplicity of menu options for baddebts, contras and so on, both the sales and purchase ledgers offersophisticated adjustment routines.andP;  Here, you can stipulate the nominalaccount to be affected -- such as that used for bad debts, for example -- andthe program does the rest.andP;  Amounts adjusted on or off an account can even beassigned to specific transactions, just as in the cash allocation routine.andM;The program handles payments to accounts well and allows full or partpayment, with or without discount and with automatic allocation to the oldestdebt, if required.andP;  You can also process a minus payment, which is a logicalway to achieve a refund and no less worthy than the Sage option for not beingmenu-defined.andM;Like many budget systems, Easifacts automatically receives transactions intothe nominal ledger at the time of entry, with direct adjustments being madevia journals.andP;  The package caters for several specific types here, includingbrought forward balances that don't affect current period figures, and autoreversing accruals and prepayments.andM;Like Sage, it provides full cashbook transactions, including menu options forbank receipts and payments, and petty cash receipts and payments.andP;  Any one ofthe 10 bank control accounts (five more than Sage) are provided for automaticposting -- F2 scrolls through the available choices.andM;This search facility is provided throughout the system, which means you don'thave to remember those cryptic account codes.andP;  You can even enter part of thecode to retrieve the first nearest match, which is a lot easier for theoccasional user.andM;Stock control and invoicing have just been added, in fact so recently that Ionly had the beta test versions for review -- the release date is currentlyset for May.andM;Unusually, stock control allows you to value each product at standard cost,average cost or replacement cost, and you can vary this at any time.andP;  Beingable to choose individual valuation to suit specific products is very rare,but then being able to take reports showing the total stock based on any ofthe valuation methods is a scoop.andM;Easifacts caters well for quantity price discounts, with five bands andassociated percentages to choose from, and its stock control system alsoprovides limited sales and purchase ordering facilities.andP;  These routines aremore a complement to the existing manual implementation, however, rather thanan actual replacement.andM;Invoicing works in a similar way to the Sage product, and allows you tocreate documents, then print them at a later date if required.andP;  You can postcash sales at the time of invoice production, with a choice of credit card,cheque or cash accounts to receive the value.andM;Several types of layout cover stock items, service invoices and differentkinds of stationery.andP;  The formats are not user definable, but Easifactsdealers will be able to create specific solutions if these are required.andO;They should cost around 50 pounds a go.andM;Easifacts is already a viable alternative to Sage and offers a more flexibleapproach to many accounting problems.andP;  The addition of invoicing and stockcontrol should enhance its credibility enormously.andM;Should I buy budget?andM;The answer to this depends largely on your state of mind, as the functionaldifferences between budget and mid-range accounting are very few --especially considering the disparity in price.andM;But while buying budget is obviously cheaper, the considerations of trainingand support are also crucial and they're often neglected.andP;  Dealers canusually add very little mark-up to a low recommended retail price, certainlynot enough to provide backup without charging for it separately -- and thisis where problems can occur.andM;You may well be able to create a meaningful set of nominal accounts, andtransfer the balances from your manual ledgers on to the new system withouttoo much trouble -- providing that you have the help of your accountant.andM;However, if you had technical support from someone with an in-depth knowledgeof the actual software concerned, especially during this changeover period,it could turn a potential nightmare into a job well done.andM;Buyers who save an awful lot of money on their accounting system lose thisadvantage if they don't plough back some of the savings in to training andsupport.andP;  When you pay 300 pounds for a single Pegasus module, you take forgranted the value added maintenance supplied by the dealer -- so why notapply the same principles when paying 300 pounds for a budget package intotal?andM;If you can think of support as a necessary optional extra to the budgetprice, you won't go far wrong.andM;Payroll administrationandM;Whether you consider payroll administration to be outside the scope ofaccounting or not, the time saved calculting PAYE alone is a strong incentiveto computerize.andM;A typical payroll system will not only compute income tax and NI, but alsoautomatically arrive at figures for SSP (Statutory Sick Pay), SMP (StatutoryMaternity Pay) and pension deductions where applicable -- and the wholeprocess will take a fraction of the manual processing time.andM;The end result can simply be a payslip for each employee, or include BACStransfers on a floppy disk ready to send to your bank, ready-printed Giroforms or machine generated cheques.andM;Stand-alone payrolls that complement budget packages are common.andP;  EasifactsPayroll for example, has a full COMPS pension scheme module and retails atjust 113.85 pounds.andP;  Sagesoft has also recently enhanced its Payroll IIapplication, and although the pension functions aren't especiallysophisticated; the rest of the facilities are impossible to match at theprice of 228.85 pounds.andM;The multi-module mid-range and top-of-the-range suites all offer payrollsthat integrate fully with the rest of the system, unfortunately at prices tomatch.andM;Before you computerize your payroll though, there's another alternative tothe hours spend looking up tax tables and discovering the dubious delights oftax-free pay.andP;  Many companies farm their entire payroll out to a specializedbureau and that can be a very cost-effective solution.andP;  If you have more than60 employees, for example, a typical price of just 75p per employee is easilyrealizable -- hardly worth the cost and hassle of doing it yourself.andM;Budget accounts packagesandM;New users traditionally start with the three main accounting areas -- salesledger, purchase ledger and nominal ledger.andM;At the low-end these features are normally integrated into one package, andoffer a cheap and efficient means of entering already prepared documents.andP;  Asa rule, the nominal ledger also includes cashbook facilities, to cope withsuch transactions as bank payments and receipts.andM;These options offer an easy method of direct entry into the nominal accounts,and save non-credit transactions like wages being forced through the purchaseledger.andP;  Sage Accountant at 286.35 pounds and Easifacts Ledgers at 228.85pounds are both good examples of this type.andM;Sage probably offers the best example of a budget program that's easy to useand features pop-up menus and on-line help.andP;  Scrollable lists of accountcodes are also accessible, which saves you having to have a printout ofaccount names constantly by your side.andP;  For example, you only need to type afew characters of the code to call up a shortlist of customers to choosefrom.andM;If you need a a little more functionality from your accounts software, thenext step is usually to buy extra modules covering invoicing and stockcontrol, order processing and possibly job costing.andP;  Again, the budget sectordoes well here, with most products offering at least invoicing and stockcontrol on top of the basic three ledgers as standard.andM;Sage Accountant Plus (458.85 pounds) and Easitacts Accounts (286.35 pounds)are reviewed here, but there are many more well-known names; Map, Compact,Amstrad Accounts Master, Take Five and Snip for starters.andP;  These supplierscan all other the full gamut of modules, ranging from anything between 250pounds and 585 pounds for what most people would consider a completeaccounting system.andM;Mid-range programsandM;When looking at the more expensive multi-module accounting suites, the firstmyth I ought to explode is you only get what you pay for'.andP;  In accountingcircles this isn't always the case.andM;It's true that budget systems are less functional in some respects than theirmore expensive counterparts, and if you realy do need a nominal ledger withmulti-currency handling for 1992 then buying budget is out.andP;  But if you canmake do with exchanging francs for sterling before they hit these shores,then why go to all that expense?andM;Expense is unfortunately the issue here: if you buy the standard systemoffered in the mid-range -- the basic Pegasus single-user system -- you willpay almost double the price of a five-module budget equivalent and end up 900pounds poorer.andP;  And Pegasus is actually at the lower end of the mid-rangepricing scale, so we should also mention other single-user products like thenew Tetra 2000 (500 pounds per module) or BOS Global 2000 (around 400 poundsper module).andP;  Multi-user versions are of course more expensive again.andM;It has long been the rule that mid-range packages are more difficult toinstall, harder to learn and have only a passing acquaintance with thefriendlier interfaces found in the budget sector.andP;  Rules, however, haveexceptions, and more mid-range packages are beginning to offer the kind ofcongenial facilities that low-end users have come to expect.andM;Account code selection windows, for example, pop-up menus and colourfulpalettes are gradually coming into vogue.andP;  Pegasus has even had a facelift(see review) and the new Tetra 2000 is brimming with improvements on thisfront.andM;So, if ease of use is less of an issue than it was, what do you get inmid-range programs that you don't get in the budget ones?andM;Perhaps the most important extra ingredient is support, and in many casesthat's what bumps up the price of these systems.andP;  You also often get a largerrange of add-on modules, which move you out of the ledgers into areas such asfixed asset management, contractors, job costing and so on.andP;  (Significantly,it's still rare to find built-in cashbook facilities or real-time accounting.andO;Batch entry of transactions and separate update of each module to the nominalledger is considered more secure at this level.)andM;If your company is on the large size, you might find budget softwareunsuitable for a number of reasons.andP;  For example, should you grow out of youraccounting software too soon there'd be a mountain of data to transfer --expensively -- to a new system.andP;  Mid-range products typically have far moreroom for expansion built-in from the outset, and in these circumstances theextra cost would be a wise investment.andM;High-end programsandM;If talking mid-range prices doesn't make you blanche, then the chances areyou're spending someone else's money -- in which case, no doubt, the solutionwill to some extent dictate the budget.andM;Corporates, multi-nationals and other large concerns have hugely differingneeds when it comes to accounting.andP;  Multi-user networks with dozens ofoperators, mainframe links to head office and a more powerful computeroperating system are the order of the day.andP;  This can be something of aculture shock for PC users.andP;  If you've ever had to leave your friendly PC towork on a dumb terminal at the end of a piece of wire that disappears intothe basement, you'll know what I mean.andM;Buying top-of-the-range accounting software isn't normally a matter ofchoice; you simply need it.andP;  In these circumstances, the user interface we'veso far placed high on the list typically becomes the last priority.andP;  Manysuppliers still believe terminals can't handle anything other than plainASCII.andM;Cost is also much less of an issue, with products like Tetra Chameleon andMultisoft Premier hovering around the 1,400 pounds per module mark.andP;  Theaccounting functions themselves differ only slightly from their midrangecousins, but the method of operation obviously had to mesh with a verydifferent working environment.andM;Security is pre-eminent.andP;  Users log time access to the system, and batchupdates take place surrounded by safety devices.andP;  With so many potentialusers, and a month-end routine that can take days, there's no alternative.andM;Along with all this security, though, you can customize -- for example, TetraChameleon offers a rich environment which can be tailored to fit precise anddemanding requirements.andP;  It's possible to do this yourself, but often you'dbe more circumspect to consider employing some outside help -- perhaps aconsultant, or an experienced dealer.andM;Bespoke software at this level doesn't come cheap, and it's very difficult toget a quote that doesn't creep upwards as the final result approaches.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
