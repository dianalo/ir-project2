Brown III (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CKP </CO><IN> RFD TNM </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Southland Corp. said it signed a letter of intent to sell 473 7-Eleven convenience stores and related properties to Circle K Corp. for about $147 million.    Southland said the Phoenix, Ariz.-based convenience-store operator will pay an additional amount for store inventories.    It said the sale, which is subject to completion of a definitive agreement and government approval, includes all of its convenience stores in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina, and some of its stores in five other states.    The sale is part of Southland's divestiture of stores and other assets to finance the $4.9 billion leveraged buy-out of the company, completed in December, by an investment firm controlled by Southland's founding family, the Thompsons of Dallas. In a leveraged buy-out, an investor group typically acquires a company largely through borrowings. The debt then is paid through the acquired firm's operations or through sale of its assets.    Southland has said it expects to sell $1.17 billion of assets by 1990. With this latest agreement, Southland said it has sold or found buyers for 775 of the 1,000 convenience stores it plans to shed, putting it &quot;substantially ahead&quot; of schedule.    Last year, completion of the buy-out was delayed after institutional investors balked at Southland's $1.5 billion junk-bond offering because they said the buy-out group had overpaid for the company and might have trouble covering its debt service if the economy soured. Southland was forced to sweeten the deal to complete the offering.    The Southland buy-out has been closely watched on Wall Street because it has broad implications for takeover financing in general and for the investment and commercial banks that loaned $2.7 billion to Thompson Co., which led the buy-out.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Circle K shares closed at $12.75, up 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
