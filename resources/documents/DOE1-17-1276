<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1276 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have proposed the zero curvature of connection of a time-dependentHartree-Bogolubov (TDHB) equation to determine collective submanifoldsfrom the differential geometrical viewpoint. We investigate the set ofthe matrix-valued nonlinear time evolution equations arising from thezero-curvature equation on the TDHB (SO/sub 2N/ Lie group) manifold.A requirement for making the block off-diagonal matrix of the equationvanish leads us to a new equation formally analogous to that of the random-phaseapproximation (RPA). The new equation, of course, depends on collectivevariables ({Lambda}, {Lambda}/sup */) defined in a Lagrange-like mannerand has a SO/sub 2N/ RPA solution as the small-amplitude limit. It mayalso work well in the large scale beyond the SO/sub 2N/ RPA under appropriateboundary and initial conditions.</TEXT></DOC>
