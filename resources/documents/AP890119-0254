The Egyptians finally drove up in a U.N. bus, accompanied byjeeps from both countries.   The two sides finally sat down to discuss the border strip ofTaba, with its Israeli-built luxury hotel and holiday village, andlater reported progress on the issue of access by Israeli touriststo the 250-acre resort strip.   Abraham Sofaer, the U.S. mediator, said he expects a compromisecan be reached.   The focus on access for Israelis suggested the strip could windup in Egypt's hands after straining Israeli-Egyptian relations forsix years.   Reuven Merhav, the chief Israeli negotiator, reported ``progressin the mutual issues we discussed, and arrangements regarding accessby Israelis.''   He said the agreed points would be summarized in Friday's roundof negotiations as an ``initial agreement.''   Nabil El Arabi, head of the Egyptian delegation, told reporters:``I don't see any problem to finishing the negotiations in twodays.'' He said only ``very small items'' were left to discuss.   ``We would like Israeli tourists to come here, not only by thetens of thousands but by the tens and hundreds of thousands,'' saidArabi.   Taba came under Israeli rule when Israel captured the SinaiPeninsula during the 1967 Middle East war. In 1982, Israel withdrewfrom all of Sinai except Taba following the 1979 Israeli-Egyptianpeace treaty.   The dispute was submitted to international arbitration. InSeptember, the arbitrators awarded Egypt key border points, but saidthey were not authorized to determine a final marker that includesthe beach resort.   The two countries are negotiating over where to place the lastmarker.   The talks are also supposed to develop a framework for Egyptianpurchase of the Sonesta Hotel, with the final deal to be worked outby negotiations involving the hotel owners.   As talks were going on, a group of Israeli yacht owners sailedalong the Taba coastline to demand free water access. An Israeligunboat chased them away.   About 50 Israelis from nearby Elat symbolically marked the borderby stretching a rope that put Taba within Israel. One protester wasdetained, Israel radio said.</TEXT></DOC>
