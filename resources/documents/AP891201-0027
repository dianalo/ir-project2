Immediately after a brief opening session, however, both sidesrecessed for the day out of respect for the Moslem Friday Sabbathand were scheduled to reopen their discussions Saturday.   Carter said he would chair only the first day of talks afterwhich the negotiations will proceed without a mediator at thedelegations' request.   He traveled to Sudan and Ethiopia this month for meetings withSudanese rebel and government leaders that resulted in bringing thewarring parties together. He was expected to leave Kenya on Sunday,but said he would remain available should his help be needed.   Carter has been in Nairobi since Nov. 19 when he arrived tochair 10 days of preliminary peace talks between warring Ethiopianfactions. Those negotiations ended Wednesday with both sidesagreeing to begin substantive talks next year.   Like the Ethiopian talks, the Sudanese negotiations areopen-ended and will take place in secret at a private Nairobiresidence provided by the Kenyan government.   It is the second time the high-level delegations have met todiscuss an end to the war in Sudan that has displaced millions ofpeople and killed hundreds of thousands. They met in Ethiopia'scapital, Addis Ababa, in August, but broke off after two dayswithout making any progress.   Three main issues are set to be discussed, the stickiest beingthe application of Sharia law _ the harsh Islamic penal codeemployed by Sudan's government _ which the rebel Sudan People'sLiberation Army wants lifted. The other measures the rebels seekbefore considering a cease-fire are the abrogation of Sudan'smilitary pacts with Libya and Egypt, and the lifting of thenation's state of emergency.   ``I have no doubt that after dealing with the first issue, theother two questions can be resolved,'' said Carter.   However, the talks also are seeking agreements that would allowfor the resumption of southern Sudan relief flights which thegovernment suspended in early November after renewed fighting withthe rebels.   Both sides had observed a de facto ceasefire begun in April whena U.N.-organized relief operation began moving large amounts offood and supplies into southern Sudan to avert widespread famine.   But the cease-fire broke down in October in battles for awestern border town and continued into November with the bombingsof several rebel-held towns.   During the opening ceremony, the rebels called on theinternational community to put pressure on Sudan's government toallow the flights to resume.   ``Use of food as a weapon is a most uncivilized and deplorablemilitary strategy, and we call upon all governments, organizationsand people of good will to bring pressure to bear on the Khartoumjunta to lift this unfortunate relief embargo,'' said rebeldelegation leader Lam Akol.   The relief effort sought to avert a repeat of 1988's tragedywhen an estimated 250,000 southern Sudanese died in a famine madeworse by war.   The rebels took up arms against Sudan's Moslem-dominatedgovernment in 1983 seeking greater autonomy and economic reformsfor the predominantly Christian and animist south.</TEXT></DOC>
