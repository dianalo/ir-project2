Though trying to ignore the children setting off firecrackersnext door in a belated Fourth of July celebration, they flinchedoccasionally as the explosions went off.   These guys were on edge. For two months, the members of the U.S.Marshals Service and local police had worked for the Street TerrorOffender Program that nabbed 456 fugitives wanted on drug ordrug-related homicide charges in the Washington-Baltimore area.   On this dreary July afternoon, they stormed into the southeastWashington home in search of a 40-year-old fugitive, James Alston.According to the officers, Alston failed to appear on a cocainedistribution charge and violated parole.   The officers had been briefed at their Navy Yard headquarters onthe home's basic layout, but they had no idea whether anyone insidewould be armed, waiting for them. So they kept their guns drawn,wore bulletproof vests _ some of them weighing up to 35 pounds _ andcarefully scanned each room.   Ten officers remained outside, making sure no one escaped ortossed contraband out a window.   There was no resistance as the entry team barged into the homeand discovered a young woman and her baby on the living room couch.   Upstairs, past the bathroom door hanging by one hinge to therotting door frame, they found six men and a woman. Some already hadinjected heroin. Others were preparing to do so. One man had aneedle sticking into his ankle, and it pulled when he jerked hisleg. Blood dripped down, soaking into his white canvas shoe.   One by one, the entry team sent the addicts down the stairs tofellow officers, ordering them to keep their hands on their heads.They were directed to keep their fingers entwined, palms outward,but the maneuver was beyond them.   Sullenly, quietly, the addicts walked downstairs. They providedtheir names and whatever identification they carried. At least onewould turn out to be false.   ``Ever been in jail?'' one was asked.   ``No.''   ``Oh, come on!''   ``No.''   ``When's the last time you were in jail?''   ``About a month and a half ago.''   And so it went, with officers peering at the men's faces andcomparing them with a grainy photocopy of Alston's picture.   Eventually a wiry man came down the stairs. He said his name wasBradley, but he matched the photo. At an officer's direction, he saton the couch beside the other refugees from the shooting rooms.   An officer confronted the man and asked if he was ``Mr. Alston.''   The man smiled slightly as he nodded his head, resigned to theinevitable.   ``That's what I like about him,'' said an officer as Alston wasescorted outside. ``The guy's honest.''   Operation STOP, which targeted fugitives for eight weeks startingMay 22, eventually arrested 25 people on drug-related homicidecharges. The other 431, including Alston, had at least threeprevious felony drug arrests or convictions and were wanted on newcharges.   Although 62 percent of those arrested were considered armed anddangerous, no shots were fired during the raids, U.S. MarshalsService Director Stanley Morris said Monday when the results wereannounced.   The $1.3 million federal program _ involving 56 federal marshalsand 34 local officers from the District of Columbia, the surroundingsuburbs and Baltimore _ was shut down after eight weeks even thoughanother 229 people targeted for arrest remain at large, the MarshalsService said.   ``People get tired,'' Morris said in an interview when asked whythe program ended before all the suspects were arrested.   ``Eight weeks is a long time. Our experience is that's about ...the length of time you can run an operation like this without peoplestarting to get homesick, a little careless and start to lose theiredge.''   Back in southeast Washington, the officers were on alert.   ``Until we leave, we're in control,'' bellowed MetropolitanPolice Department Sgt. Ricky Barrow. ``If you want to get up, asksomebody...   ``What we've seen today gives us about carte blanche to come inhere anytime we want,'' he lectured the woman who rents the home,the woman whom a tipster had identified as Alston's girlfriend.``Everything leads us to believe you're running a crack house,heroin,'' he said as she shook her head, saying there's no crack.   The officers eventually freed everyone but Alston, even thoughthey were caught shooting heroin and two full hypodermic needleswere found in a dish on a bedroom dresser.   ``Why clog up the system?'' said one officer.   Before the six-hour series of raids was over about two dozenaddicts and squatters had been rousted.   Half were found in a well-known shooting gallery the team hasraided repeatedly. After ordering the addicts to lie down on therain-drenched sidewalk and checking their identification, theofficers ``cut them loose,''   One marshal told an addict familiar to such busts, ``See youlater.''</TEXT></DOC>
