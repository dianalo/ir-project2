(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A U.S. magistrate refused to suspendaround-the-clock medical surveillance of the ailing wife ofconvicted spy Jonathan Pollard, despite her doctor's contention thatit aggravates her problems.   ``She has no dignity at all,'' Dr. Edward Goldberg said Thursdayof the 24-hour watch, which includes trips to the bathroom. ``Ithink that is the added complication (to her condition). At worst,it is punitive. At best, it showed either inexperience orincompetence.''   Anne Henderson-Pollard, who is serving a five-year prison term inconnection with her husband's crimes, is being treated at theFederal Medical Center for gastrointestinal problems that havereduced her weight to 90 pounds.   In a lawsuit against the center's warden, Joseph Bogan, shecharged that she is being subjected to ``cruel and unusualpunishment'' because doctors have been ``deliberately indifferent toher medical needs.''   At Thursday's hearing, her lawyer, former Watergate prosecutorHamilton Fox, asked interim relief from the 24-hour watch. U.S.Magistrate Jan Symchych denied the motion, saying medical opinion isdivided on the value of the surveillance.   Symchych recessed the hearing until Feb. 16, whenHenderson-Pollard is expected to testify.   The pale, 28-year-old inmate hunched over during the hearing asthe center's medical director, Dr. Martha Grogan, said suveillancewas needed because Henderson-Pollard's weight is dangerously low andshe has refused treatment.   ``There's never been a patient who's been so uncooperative,''Grogan said.   Grogan said Henderson-Pollard has been examined by 22 Mayo Clinicspecialists at a cost of $55,640. She said the primary diagnosis was``irritable bowel syndrome,'' a little-understood ailment associatedwith chronic abdominal pain.   Fox maintains that his client suffers from a more seriousgastrointestinal problem that has been exacerbated by a hostilepatient-physician relationship.   Late last month, Jonathan Pollard, who is serving a life sentencein a federal prison in Marion, Ill., launched a five-day hungerstrike to protest his wife's transfer from a Danbury, Conn.,hospital to the Rochester facility.   Pollard, 34, was convicted in 1987 of supplying classified U.S.documents to Israeli agents. Henderson-Pollard was charged as anaccessory to his possession of the documents.   She was transferred to Rochester Jan. 14, three days after shecollapsed at a prison camp in Danbury.</TEXT></DOC>
