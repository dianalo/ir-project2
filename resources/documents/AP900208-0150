(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A state Supreme Court justice arrested ondrunken driving charges last year has been publicly reprimanded byhis colleagues.   Justice Robert L. Clifford, 65, the second-ranking member of thestate's highest court, pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicatedand refusing to submit to a Breathalyzer test after his car wasstopped by police Oct. 12.   ``We believe that any judge convicted of driving whileintoxicated should be publicly reprimanded,'' the Supreme Courtreprimand issued Wednesday states. It noted that the high court hasresisted efforts to weaken the state's drunken driving laws.   ``When a judge commits such an offense,'' the statementcontinued, ``the public's confidence in the judiciary is inevitablyaffected.''   The public reprimand was made by Clifford's fellow justices as aresult of a recommendation made by the Advisory Committee onJudicial Conduct. One member of the committee said Clifford shouldbe privately admonished in a letter, but the justices said theybelieve they have the power to reprimand one of their own membersand the offense justified it.   Clifford was ``treated in this matter precisely as any citizenwould have been,'' the reprimand stated. ``No favors were asked,suggested or granted. The penalty was that almost invariablyimposed for a first offense.''   Clifford would not comment on the reprimand Wednesday.   In addition to the reprimand from his colleagues, a lower courthad ordered Clifford to pay $615 in fines and court costs, give uphis license fo a year, and attend 10 sessions of the state'sprogram for counseling and educating drunken drivers. He could havereceived up to 30 days in jail.</TEXT></DOC>
