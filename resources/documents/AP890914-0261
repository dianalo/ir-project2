PLC said Thursday it wasselling $1.31 billion in assets and cutting its work force by 17percent in a major restructuring aimed at boosting efficiency andfocusing on ``higher-risk, higher-reward'' oil exploration.   BP, the world's fourth-largest oil company, said it would sellexploration assets in the North Sea and six other countries to OryxEnergy Co., one of the largest independent oil and gas producers inthe United States.   BP said it has agreed to sell 9 percent of its Britishexploration assets in the North Sea, including four oil- andgas-producing fields, five prospective developments and 42unexplored blocks.   It said it would slash 1,700 jobs in Scotland, London andHouston. The cuts are to be achieved through early retirement andvoluntary departures but the company didn't rule out layoffs.   The London-based oil giant said the streamlining should reduceoverhead by more than $150 million a year.   BP Exploration is being reorganized into three regional operatingcompanies, and international technology division and a global gasunit, BP said.   BP's shares fell on the news. They finished at 320 pence, or$4.99, a share on London's Stock Exchange, down 5 pence, or 8 cents,from Wednesday's close.   ``We have to get into a position where our assets are workingmost efficiently,'' John Browne, chief executive officer of BPExploration, told a news conference.   BP's margins were being pressured by higher costs, higher taxes,greater regulation, and environmental and safety concerns, Brownesaid.   ``We haven't taken the meat-axe to the company. We're preparingnot only for today but also for tomorrow,'' he said. ``We'reshifting our focus to ensure that we put enough money into frontierexploration.''   Browne said the proceeds from the asset sale would allow thecompany to invest in areas it believes have more potential _Vietnam, Ethiopia, the Gulf of Mexico and the western margins of theBritish continental shelf.   The sale package includes assets in Ecuador, Gabon, Dubai, Italy,Colombia and Indonesia.   Oryx Energy, based in Dallas, was formed when Sun Oil of theUnited States spun off its U.S. exploration and production businessas the Sun Exploration and Production Co. in November 1988. It wasrenamed in May 1989.   ``There will be more asset disposals. If exploration turns upsomething that would be more useful to someone else, we'll sellit,'' Browne said.   Nick Clayton, an analyst at the London investment firm Smith NewCourt PLC, said, ``Effectively this is recognition by BP that one ofthe means of improving profitability when crude oil prices are notrising dramatically is to focus on the cost aspect of the profitequation.''   John Toalster, an analyst at the London investment firm HoareGovett Ltd., said: ``It's essentially the clearing of the desk, theclearing for Horton to take over ... and to have a company that ismore lean and efficient, one that is more poised for the future.''   Toalster was referring to BP's 50-year-old deputy chairman,Robert Horton, who is to take over as chairman upon Sir PeterWalters' retirement in March at the age of 59. The leadership changewas announced last week.   Clayton said BP obtained a ``very full price'' for its assets.   ``It represents an excellent deal for BP and demonstrates theirability to extract value out of their portfolio.''   BP is raising cash to reduce its debt and probably to build up awar chest for another major takeover, probably an American company,the analysts speculated.   Toalster said: ``It would want to increase is exposure in theU.S.A. and into gas and ideally acquire some assets in thedeveloping world.''   But Clayton said, ``The next few months will be spent polishingthe balance sheet,'' by reducing debt.   ``Any move to make a major acquisition would follow when BobHorton takes over,'' he said.   The restructuring follows BP's $4.4 billion acquisition ofBritoil PLC last year. BP purchased the 45 percent of Standard OilCo. of Ohio it didn't already own for $7.9 billion in 1987.   In May, BP agreed to sell its mineral interests to the Britishmining group RTZ Corp. for $6.5 billion. BP also is planning to sellits coal business later in the year for an undisclosed amount.   BP is trying to narrow the gap with Royal Dutch-Shell Group ofCos., and Exxon Corp., the two biggest oil companies, Toalster said.Mobil Corp. ranks third.   ``The only way to do this is to move the company up in terms ofthe risk profile, you have to increase the risk element. You can'tachieve that kind of growth without incurring risk,'' the analystsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
