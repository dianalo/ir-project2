A circular gravity minimum of about 17mgal and about 40 km in diameter is centered on the chosen drill site.Magnetoelluric measurements indicate anomalously low resistivities arepresent shallower in the crust than what is normally found, with themost anomalous resistivity depth profiles southwest of the drillsite.A wide spectrum of borehole investigations, including VSP, natural gammaspectroscopy, sonic, resistivity, and borehole gravity logging help explainthe results from the surface geophysics. Doleritic sills, fine-grainedgranite intrusives and fracture zones all play a role in the surfacegeophysical expression. An attempt has been made to characterize thefracture zones, which cause both resistivity and sonic anomalies, usingthe above-mentioned logging tools, as well as the micro electric scannertool (FMS) and the geochemical tool string that includes the NGS, GST,and AACT tools. The FMS displays distinct images of the fracture zonesand allows for orientation of the individual fractures within them. Thegeochemical tool string, provides important information conce rning thechemical composition of the rock. Tentative results show that the rockis more porous than may have been expected and porosities of around 5%are possible in fracture zones at depths exceeding 4 km.</TEXT></DOC>
