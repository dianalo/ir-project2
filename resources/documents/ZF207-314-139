(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hot Technologies for 1989andM;On the cusp of the '90s, artificial intelligence, which only a few years agoreceived a chilly and skeptical reception at IS shops, is heating up thetechnology thermometer in 1989.andP;  AI in the form of embedded expert systemswill add sizzle to a host of systems applications in industries as diverse asutilities and chemicals.andP;  And companies in other sectors--transportation,electronics, health care, and process manufacturing, for example--will haveexpert systems projects simmering away during a year that marks the end ofthe decade that brought technology down to the desktop and onto the factoryfloor.andM;Communications fueled some of these changes.andP;  In 1989, communications willcontinue to be a hot project area for information systems chiefs fromPortland, Maine, to Portland, Ore.andP;  Within the communications domain, localarea networks (LANs) with tentacles that reach to the workstation and PCstill spark the interest and investment of firms in a wide cross section ofindustries.andP;  Some of these newly wired workstations may be powered by Unix,ATandamp;T's portable operating system that is slowly migrating away from thecampus and into the heart of corporate America.andM;Two newer and unrelated technologies, computer-aided software engineering(CASE) and imaging systems, have also ignited interest among a variety ofindustries.andP;  The banking and finance, insurance, and transportation sectorsall hope to realize their vision of imaging systems within the next fewyears.andP;  A bit cautious, perhaps, but equally enthusiastic are firms in thehealth care and petroleum sectors that will actively be experimenting withoptical technology during the year.andM;While most of the companies DATAMATION talked to were either evaluating,experimenting with, or expanding their AI activities, they still weren'tcommitting big bucks to these efforts.andP;  The overwhelming majority werepragmatically optimistic about the technology's prospects.andP;  &quot;AI has somegood, long-term potential,&quot; sums up Richard Sauder, director of operationalresearch at $4.1 billion Norfolk Southern Corp. in Atlanta.andP;  &quot;It can do awaywith many laborious processes.andP;  The important thing is not to get carriedaway with its potential,&quot; Sauder advises.andP;  &quot;You have to walk carefullythrough the AI battlefield to get where you want to be.&quot;andM;Where Norfolk Southern and most other railroad concerns want to arrive is ata system that will enable them to perform better derailment and accidentanalysis modeling.andP;  &quot;We'll evaluate AI carefully for this kind of applicationthis year, and we may start implementing it the year after,&quot; reports Sauder.andO;Materials management is another area where Norfolk Southern may use expertsystems.andP;  The company is currently running a test to determine how AI couldimprove invoice processing chores that are now done manually by itspurchasing staff.andM;Where AI is on track with the railroad industry is in the Advanced TrainControl System (ATCS), a program jointly funded by the industry and theDepartment of Transportation.andP;  ATCS, which will incorporate expert systemsalong with traditional computer and communications technologies, is designedto better control the location, movement, length, and speed of trains--thushelping to save fuel, eliminate accidents, and minimize delays.andM;Another company that's been getting smart in a studied way about AI isAshland Chemical Co. in Columbus, Ohio.andP;  Ashland MIS director Robert Beersreports that two expert system pilot projects for new applications will belaunched this year.andP;  What makes this technology so appealing, says Beers, isthat it doesn't require new hardware.andP;  Ashland plans to use its expertsystems to support back-office and sales management functions.andM;Combustion Engineering Inc., Stamford, Conn., is one business that hasalready experienced the advantages of expert help.andP;  The firm is implementingexpert systems to rapidly redesign the parts it uses to manufacturecoal-burning boilers for power utilities.andP;  The system &quot;cans&quot; the knowledge ofengineers, compressing 1,000 hours of engineering time into about 100.andP;  &quot;Wesee productivity gains of 10 to one,&quot; declares Robert Kistner, vp of IS andengineering automation for the $3 billion Connecticut company.andM;Another Connecticut firm, Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., is also expanding itsusage of expert systems.andP;  This year, the $72.8 billion Hartford insurer plansto develop expert systems that will be integrated with existing applicationsand also operate in a standalone mode.andP;  All the development work will be doneon PC platforms.andP;  &quot;Whether or not we move these [expert systems] to themainframe isn't the question,&quot; insists Jeffry Alperin, assistant vp forcorporate technology planning at Aetna.andP;  &quot;The mainframe is not uniformlyappropriate [for all  software]--especially expert systems.andM;The platform also isn't an issue at Southern California Edison Co., which hasbeen deploying expert systems and natural language-based systems on PCs, Lispmachines, and mainframes for the past three years.andP;  One of its recentlycompleted projects is a load forecasting system that suggests the optimaltimes and quantities Edison should observe when purchasing the oil, gas, anduranium necessary for its electricity production.andM;The $6 billion utility, headquartered in Rosemead, Calif., has certainlyentered the AI age.andP;  Having set up a new corporate expert systems group, thisyear Edison will be focusing on mainframe applications using corporate dataand on rule-based systems that use PC platforms, explains Michael Mushet,manager of corporate technical research and architecture at Edison.andM;Even the cost-cutting, cautious petroleum industry has been exploring the newapplication avenues opened up by AI.andP;  Shell Oil Co. in Houston has beenexperimenting with expert systems for several years.andP;  &quot;We put groups ofpeople who have expert systems knowledge into some of our business centers tosee how they could improve our operations,&quot; says Chester Jones, Shell'sgeneral manager of technology and development.andP;  &quot;They've made an excellentstart, and we're very satisfied with what's coming out of this effort,&quot; hedeclares.andM;Expert systems are also emerging in the electronics industry.andP;  At HarrisCorp. in Melbourne, Fla., expert systems are helping out with chip design.andO;At Xerox, they're a sales support tool.andP;  IS executives in the electronicsindustry expect AI investments to accelerate over the next five years as moreand more expert wares go to work on such tasks as diagnosing chip fabricationproblems and operating customer help lines.andM;Baxter Health Care Corp. in Deerfield, Ill., has a similar AI time frame.andO;According to David Sennett, corporate director of technology research anddevelopment at the $6.5 billion health care company, it will take from two tofive years before expert systems are a major IS tool in his operation.andP;  Stillat the evaluation stage, Sennett has three criteria for assessing an expertsystem shell: it must be available on mainframes and micros; it must besupplied by a viable vendor; and it must be thrifty in terms of licensing.andO;So far, Sennett has found three products that fill this bill, but he declinesto name them.andP;  Baxter will be doing expert system prototypes this year totest these products out.andM;The insurance industry has been actively using expert shells, particularly inthe underwriting process.andP;  Daniel Cavanagh, senior IS vp at Metropolitan Lifein New York, breaks down the insurance industry's technology usage into threecategories--now, near-term, and longer-term.andP;  He puts AI and on-linetransaction processing (OLTP) in the &quot;now&quot; group.andP;  LANs and workstations, henotes, are also immediate items.andP;  Aetna's Alperin agrees with Cavanagh'scategories.andP;  &quot;In the short term, we're looking at extensions to our OLTPsystems by making connections to LANs,&quot; Alperin points out.andM;Greater OLTP CapabilitiesandM;On the OLTP front, Cavanagh predicts that &quot;more improvements will be comingdown the pike in hardware and software.andP;  But for now, we're usingconcentrators, namely 3270s, and a 56Kbps dedicated line to our T1multiplexers.&quot;andP;  Banc One Services Corp., a subsidiary of Banc One Corp., the$24.5 billion five-state banking group in Columbus, Ohio, is also optimisticabout OLTP.andP;  Banc One Services president David Van Lear envisions greaterOLTP capabilities for his firm in the year ahead.andM;Southern California Edison is another heavy user of OLTP.andP;  Edison will alsobe altering its LANscape this year.andP;  &quot;The push is on to reallocate our[4,400] PCs and [5,000] dumb terminals to LANs,&quot; explains Mushet.andP;  Currently,only one application, a credit collection system, runs on the LAN.andP;  The restof the shared applications at Edison are linked via a wide area network(WAN).andM;At banks and other firms in the financial field, LANs continue to be thelifeline and lifeblood of these organizations.andP;  The financial division atChemical Bank in New York, for example, leans heavily on LANs.andP;  &quot;We're fullynetworked,&quot; confirms division vp Martin Schwimmer.andP;  &quot;We use almost everyimaginable service--file sharing, printer sharing, [IBM] 3270 emulation, youname it.&quot;andP;  Despite this LAN mass, the division plans to add yet morecapabilities to its 3Com net.andP;  Schwimmer reports that facsimile sharing willbe brought on-line at the beginning of this year.andM;While some retailers--such as Best Products Co.andP;  Inc. in Richmond, Va., andWal-Mart Stores in Bentonville, Ark.--are setting up more satellite dishes ontheir stores, J.C.andP;  Penney is enjoying the fruits of the LAN it laid at itsnew Dallas headquarters.andP;  The $15.3 billion retailer's IBM token-ring LAN,which went live last spring, ties together some 800 computers at variousbuildings on its home-office site.andM;Penney's LAN had its risks as well as its rewards.andP;  &quot;Security,&quot; points outDave Evans, vp of systems and dp at Penney, &quot;is not as good as we'reaccustomed to on our mainframe.&quot;andP;  On the other hand, Evans notes, the LAN hasresulted in a big boost in productivity.andM;Productivity gains were also the raison d'etre for a LAN being set up at GAFCorp. in Wayne, N.J.andM;Other process manufacturers, particularly those in the food and beverageindustry, are even more LAN-locked.andP;  Many have plans to expand and improvetheir LANs this year.andP;  &quot;We're trying to become a networked organization,&quot;declares Harry Wallaesa, MIS vp at Campbell Soup Co.andP;  The Camden, N.J., foodprocessor is pouring gobs of money into token-ring LANs that will be tied toa network of host computers sprinkled throughout the $4.9 billion company.andM;At Quaker Oats Co. in Chicago, a new network management system is scheduledto be installed this year.andP;  The system will manage the company's WAN,integrating it with Quaker's LAN.andP;  &quot;This will give us the opportunity to morefully exploit fiber optics and LANs, and get a greater return for ourinvestment,&quot; explains Ronald Brzezinski, is vp at the $3 billion foodconglomerate.andM;Increased efficiency in operations is what $831 million Sunkist Growers Inc.,andO;Van Nuys Calif., is hoping will result from a LAN project it has undertakenthis year.andP;  Originally set up to handle administrative chores, Sunkist's LANwill be expanded to connect its corporate systems--an IBM 4341 and two HP3000s--with 150 terminals in its sales offices and shipping points.andP;  Thecitrus company plans to have the entire operation on-line by the end of 1989or early 1990, according to Robert Campbell, Sunkist's director ofinformation resources, who says that &quot;revision of our communications systemis a big thing with us.&quot;andM;Also aiming for the same efficiencies through communications is the Dr.andO;Pepper/Seven-Up Cos.andP;  Inc.andP;  The newly merged company is in the process oflinking its IBM 3081K and VAX systems at its Dallas headquarters to 200 PCsthat are dispersed throughout two other locations.andM;&quot;Right now we're using token-ring technology,&quot; comments Wayne Bell, datacenter manager at the Texas beverage company.andP;  &quot;We expected to have the newsystem fully operational by the end of 1989, but it may not be finished bythen,&quot; adds Bell.andM;LAN Lock-InandM;Where there're LANs, there're PCs and their more high-poweredpartners--workstations.andP;  Eurmeister reports that during the year, BellAtlantic will step up its work with scientific engineering workstations thatrun computer-aided design (CAD) software.andP;  The company will also expand itsearly efforts to equip its inhouse reps with IBM PS/2s and other comparablemachines.andM;Banc One Services is pursuing a pilot workstation project that's based on anapplication generator and other productivity aids.andP;  Banc One Services, whichhandles its parent company's credit card services and dp operations, usesvarious Intel 80286-based PS/2s as well as IBM XTs and IBM ATs in its tellr,end-user, and development environments.andM;Such &quot;low-end&quot; machines &quot;will play an increasingly important role in 1989 andbeyond,&quot; vows Barry Gilbert, vp of platform systems at Citibank N.A.andO;Platform systems is charged with administering the bank's branch distributionsystem that connects 235 offices in the New York area.andP;  The system iscomprised of 275 NCR Tower XPs that are linked to an IBM 3090 host via anX.25 network.andM;Most of the terminals on this net are dumb ASCII stations.andP;  More recently,Citibank added some Mac IIs that are hooked together via an AppleTalknetwrok.andP;  This year Gilbert says he will be &quot;looking very closely at PS/2sand maybe some other intelligent work stations for their graphicscapabilities.&quot;andM;PS/2's operating system continues to spark the interest of a number ofcompanies--Shell Oil, for one.andP;  The Texas oiler is developing businessapplications based on OS/2.andP;  &quot;We have a tremendous interest in and commitmentto OS/2,&quot; gushes Shell technology manager Jones, &quot;and we're anxiosly awaitingother releases of OS/2 products so that we can fully implement ourt program.candM;On the engineering side, Shell will opt for Unix workstations, and it's notalone in making that decision.andP;  In several companies we contacted, Unix wasthe clear workstation of choice for engineering chores.andP;  In fact, most of theelectronics firms interviewed expect to see Unix spread from engineering tosuch business applications as running systems in field sales and serviceoffices.andM;Unix is already fueling business applications at Citibank.andP;  The New Yorkbank's entire branch distribution system is based on Unix, which runs onTower XPs.andP;  And Banc One's brand-new IBM AS/400 will run a Unix-basedcollection management system.andM;The operating system has also operating at Aetna.andP;  &quot;We're using Unix modestlynow,&quot; notes Aetna's Alperin, &quot;but within a couple of years, we expect that itwill rival our use of OS/2 and other operating systems.&quot;andM;Out in Bentonville, Ark., Wal-MArt Stores is getting ready to take the plungeinto the Unix universe.andP;  During the next 16 months, the $15.9 billiondiscount chain will have some 1,500 IBM RT PCs installed in its stores thatwill run Aix, Big Blue's own version of Unix, and the software, built on aPosix base, will be flexible enough to enable the company to switch towhatever system best suits the job at hand.andM;This portability aspect is what really sold the store on Unix.andP;  &quot;If we decidesometime down the road that DEC or Sun or ATandamp;T has a better Unix machine,we'll go with that one,&quot; explains Mark Schmidt, the director of Wal-Mart'stechnology development.andP;  &quot;And we won't,&quot; he adds, &quot;be overly concerned withlosing the programming investment that we've made.&quot;andM;Retailers such as Wal-Mart, Best, and Penney have also climbed on early toanother technology bandwagon that's picking up speed this year.andP;  It's theCASE caravan.andP;  These retailers, which actually began using CASE tools lastyear, expect the technology to provide even more important productivity toolsover the next five years.andP;  Penney's systems chief Evans reports that half ofhis programming staff has been equipped with CASE tools and technicalworkstations.andP;  Within five years, he promises, &quot;they'll all have it.&quot;andM;Metro Life's Cavanagh says that both CASe and imaging systems aretechnologies that the insurance industry will implement in the near term.andO;Aetna's Alperin notes that &quot;in 1989, we'll see more emphasis on methods thanon the CASE tools themselves.&quot;andM;One company that's no stranger to CASE is Southern California Edison, whichhas been involved with the software development technology since the early'70s.andP;  &quot;Now we're taking a wait-and-see attitude,&quot; explains Edision's Mushet.andO;&quot;We're doing some dabling, but we need to determine how [CASE] tools tie intoour old, clumsy applications.&quot;andM;Moving to the middle of the country, Quaker Oats says it has a few tools inits own CASE tool chest that it wants to employ to make some of its othersoftware programs more usable and productive.andP;  Quaker's core transactionsystem is now based on a fourth generation language that's also being used towrite all new systems.andP;  CASE has also caught on at the Corporate ServiceGroup of Intel Corp. in Santa Clara.andP;  &quot;We've had mixed results&quot; from the useof packaged software, says Al Olson, the group's technical services manger.andO;&quot;That's why we're going to CASE tools.andP;  We're going toward making our ownsoftware in an efficient fashion.&quot;andP;  Industry insider Intel isn't the onlycompany that's disenchanted with packaged software.andP;  As a matter of fact, themajority of companies contacted by DATAMATION gave the cold shoulder tooff-the-shelf in favor of more in-house development.andP;  The exception here washealth care companies, which are tending to opt for smaller projects and morepractical technologies.andM;Like the insurance industry, health care businesses also have their eye onimaging systems.andP;  Baxter Health Care has pilot projects in imaging and in theancillary area of optical storage.andP;  In the optical storage realm, Baxter isconsidering using CD-ROM technology sometime in the future for storingreports and product information.andP;  &quot;Right now,&quot; points out Baxter's Sennett,&quot;we're distributing this information via tapes, which is a pain.&quot;andM;The finance division at Chemical Bank hopes to avoid such pain in the shortterm by moving to CD-ROMs.andP;  The New York-based bank is planning to transferthe management reports it now has on microfiche to CD-ROMs.andP;  Later on, itwill add the optical storage component to its IS network so that users canhave instant access to these reports.andP;  Right now, Chem Bank is in the processof getting CD-ROM bids from such companies as Sony and Panasonic, accordingto assistant vp Schwimmer.andM;Jones of Shell Oil concedes that imaging technology &quot;will have a big impacton us.&quot;andP;  While the $17 billion company has no plans for purchases in thisarea in '89, it is &quot;monitoring&quot; optical storage devices very closely becauseit wants to reduce the space used to store mag tapes that contain reams toarchival data.andM;Keep On Truckin'andM;Transportation companies, which are some of Shell Oil's biggest customers,are also looking to optical technologies.andP;  Imaging could be a godsend tocompanies like St. Johnsbury Trucking Co. in Vermont, which must handlecountless pieces of paper to ensure that its 15,000 daily freight shipmentsreach their appointed destinations.andP;  &quot;Optical imaging would make it possibleto retrieve the documents easier and faster, and it would save a lot ofspace,&quot; reasons David Brown, vp of IS and administration at the truckingcompany.andP;  &quot;We would like to implement optical imaging technology in three tofive years,&quot; he adds.andM;Optical storage technology offers North American Van Lines &quot;superopportunities,&quot; enthuses Dick Goodspeed, vp of IS at the company's FortWayne, Ind., headquarters.andP;  &quot;This is a very paper-intensive industry, withlots of documents for every movement of vehicles and goods.andP;  These documentsneed to be saved for a long time.andP;  So anything that can be done to cut downon this paper cost would be welcome.andP;  By putting the information on opticaldisks,&quot; he continues, &quot;we should be able to eliminate microfilming ofdocuments.&quot;andP;  To help make that move away from microfilm, North American willbe launching a pilot optical disk program during the second or third quarterof this year.andM;Southern Pacific Transportation Co. will beat North American to the opticalpunch, leapfrogging to a full-blown imaging system.andP;  The San Franciscocompany expects to have a pilot study on imaging technology under way in thenext few months, with an operational system set to roll by year's end,according to J.M.andP;  Graziani, vp of management services at the $2 billionrailroad and trucking concern.andM;Quaker Oats, which is also interested in optical storage, is more wary thanthe transportation companies.andP;  The food firm may begin using optical disks orother high-density disk storage devices in three to four years, according toIS boss Brzezinski.andP;  &quot;We are moving very cautiously,&quot; Brzezinski says, &quot;andwill probably start using them [optical disks] in isolated areas at first.&quot;andM;Naturally the biggest boosters of imaging technologies are oganizations thatgenerate the most paper.andP;  The premier paper pushers are government agencies,followed by insurance companies and banks.andP;  Banc One Services, for example,has embarked upon a project with IBM, Unisys, and the Federal Reserve todevelop a check image-capture system.andP;  Banc One's president Van Lear saysthat his firm will invest substantial time and money in the effort this year.andM;Insurance Companies' Big PushandM;Those investments will pale in comparison with the vast sums insurancecompanies are expected to pump into imaging systems.andP;  One of the primepumpers will probably be Aetna, which has half a dozen tests already underway.andP;  Alperin, Aetna's technology planner, claims that his company ranks &quot;atthe top of the second tier of companies&quot; that are working in the imaging areaintensively.andP;  In the first tier are American Express, Citibank, and insurancegiant USAA Information Services in San Antonio, Texas.andP;  &quot;We are working withbetter, faster, and cheaper technology,&quot; Alperin maintains, &quot;because welearned from their [the firsttier firms] mistakes and their pilots.&quot;andP;  Thisyear, Alperin notes, Aetna will be concentrating on delivering imagingcapabilities to user locations via a LAN-file server setup.andM;Another insurance provider, The Phoenix Insurance Co. in Hartford, Conn., isusing an image management system supplied by FileNet Corp., Costa Mesa,Calif., in one of its divisions.andP;  Phoenix IS vp Lee Lapioli says that anotherdivision will go on-line to the system this year at the insurance company,which has $8.8 billion in assets.andM;While imaging technology is fast becoming a reality in the insurancebusiness, IS execs in that industry don't expect IBM's Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) to arrive at their firms anytime soon.andP;  &quot;SAA,&quot; retortsCitibankhs Gilbert, &quot;will have zero impact in 1989.andP;  I've been looking at it,and it's still more akin to vaporware than anything else.&quot;andP;  Aetna's Alperinagrees.andP;  &quot;Most of SAA is still not available, so you can't build around it,&quot;he notes.andP;  &quot;We're asking questions, especially at the micro level.&quot;andM;It seems that Phoenix's Lapioli has already gotten some answers on SAA.andP;  &quot;In1989, we expect SAA will be an integral part of our in-house administrativesoftware development project,&quot; he says.andP;  I-house at Southern CaliforniaEdison, the IS team has come up with its own bridge to SAA.andP;  The company,according to Edison's Mushet, &quot;has developed its own SAA-like consistency forour on-line applications--both internal and external.&quot;andP;  As IBM rolls out SAA,&quot;we will migrate over,&quot; says Mushet.andM;Phillip Farr, MIS director at American Petrofina Inc., a $2 billion petroleumand petrochemical products producer in Dallas, is another SAA supporter whoexpects to inaugurate an implementation effort this year.andP;  &quot;We're going to bean early participant in [SAA] technology,&quot; confirms Farr, &quot;because from whatwe've seen, the risk of getting in at this stage is definitely worth itdespite the budget constraints.andM;&quot;If what IBM tells us pans out, SAA should drastically change the way dataprocessing can be done,&quot; predicts Farr.andP;  &quot;We should be able to do more ofwhat we're doing now with our equipment, and do it better and faster.andP;  Weshould also be able to get rid of some of the third-party software we're nowusing.&quot;andP;  SAA will also be making its debut at baby food producer Beech-NutNutrition Corp. &quot;in the not too distant future,&quot; according to Steve Bartlett,manager of systems and programming at the Canajoharie, N.Y., company.andO;Beech-Nut is counting on SAA to ease communications between its headquarterand plants.andP;  &quot;We're using pass-through software now, &quot;but we can't do filesharing,&quot; Bartlett complains.andP;  &quot;SAA would allow us to do that,&quot; he adds.andP;  &quot;Itcould be a great time-saver and we could get more information faster.&quot;andM;Out on the West Coast, Unocal Corp. is in no heated rush to plug in thehottest technologies.andP;  For the $8 billion Los Angeles petroleum company, 1989is a year of evaluation, not execution.andP;  &quot;By the end of the year,&quot; says BobDolan, manager of strategic development for corporate IS at Unocal, &quot;weshould have figured out which of the technologies--such as CASE, OS/2, SAA,and optical systems--are sufficiently mature, have the widest availability,and make the most economic sense in our environment.&quot;andM;Like most cost-conscious companies today, these economic considerations carrythe most weight with Unocal.andP;  &quot;We won't do anything without its makingeconomic sense,&quot; points out Dolan.andP;  &quot;But once you get beyond this primaryconsideration, you look at the long-term viability of new technology like SAAand CASE.andP;  They can have a tremendous impact on your operations.andP;  And youdon't make a decision one year to go with one of them and unmake it the next.andO;These is just too much at stake.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
