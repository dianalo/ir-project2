PRASSO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   United Airlines' Machinists union said Friday itsofficials have been contacted by two buyout specialists seeking tobuy UAL Corp., the parent of United and a prime takeover target.   One of the specialists later denied that it had approached theMachinists, but a Machinists leader stood by the union's position.   If those contacts develop into an offer, it could jeopardize the$6.75 billion deal that pilots and management have proposed forbuying the nation's second-largest airline. A separate Machinistsbid could also drive a wedge between two of the industry's mostpowerful unions.   Billionaire Texas investor Robert Bass and takeover firm KohlbergKravis Roberts andamp; Co., both mentioned in previous speculation about aUAL takeover, are seeking meetings to discuss whether the Machinistswould be interested in supporting their bids, said spokesman JamesConley of the International Association of Machinists in Washington.   The contacts were preliminary and no possible purchase price wasdisclosed, Conley said. He would not say whether further meetingshad been scheduled or indicate whether the Machinists would supporteither party.   But a Kohlberg Kravis spokeswoman in New York, who asked not tobe identified, said late Friday that the firm hasn't met with theMachinists about UAL and isn't interested in bidding for it.   John Peterpaul, general vice president of the Machinists,insisted that Kohlberg Kravis had discussed that subject about amonth ago with the union's financial advisers.   Spokesmen for UAL, the pilots union and Bass declined commentFriday on the overtures to the Machinists.   Last Friday, the pilot-management group made its proposal to buyChicago-based UAL, topping a $6.19 billion sweetened offer from LosAngeles oilman Marvin Davis. Under the pilot-management bid, BritishAirways PLC would own 15 percent of UAL's stock for an investment of$750 million. The employees would agree to unspecified wageconcessions in exchange for 75 percent of the stock.   The Machinists' cooperation is crucial to the success of thepilot-led bid, but the Machinists had expressed doubt about thatplan. Conley's hint of a separate bid appeared aimed at puttingpressure on UAL management and the pilots to address the Machinists'concerns about job security and high debt levels.   The Machinists, representing 25,000 of the airline's 70,000employees, contend that the pilot-management bid is too high. Theyfavor recapitalization as a means of fighting takeover bids for UAL.   The Machinists' posture appeared to strengthen the chances thatDavis could succeed in his rival bid.   There have been rumors that Davis has started selling his stakein the company, an indication he might scrap his takeover effort.   UAL stock, which fell $5.12{ a share Thursday on the Davis rumor,lost another $1.50 to close at $280.25 Friday on the New York StockExchange.   The Transportation Department has indicated it may move soon tocurb leveraged buyouts and foreign investments in the nation'sairline industry.   Pat Friend, president of the Association of Flight Attendantsrepresenting 12,700 workers at United, said Friday the flightattendants are still considering the pilots' proposal.   ``We have not committed ourselves either way,'' she said.   The flight attendants have been trying to negotiate a newcontract for nearly two years, and Ms. Friend said participation ina buyout would have to include a new contract.   The bidding for the coveted UAL began several weeks ago with anoffer by Davis, driving up the company's stock on speculation thathigher offers would emerge.   Bass is a leading corporate dealmaker with interests in oil,financial services, real estate, publishing and investments inseveral well-known companies.   Kohlberg Kravis is a New York-based investment house that helpedpioneer the takeover strategy known as the leveraged buyout, inwhich companies are bought with borrowed money repaid throughearnings or asset sales of the target company.</TEXT></DOC>
