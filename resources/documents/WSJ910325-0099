Salomon Jr. to the newpost of chief investment officer of Salomon Brothers AssetManagement Inc.   The appointment underscores the growing commitment at manyWall Street securities firms -- even among big investmentbanks -- to smooth out earnings volatility by managingcustomer assets, which continue to earn the firm managementfees in all markets.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This makes sense for the firm going into the 1990s,&quot; saysMichael Holland, head of Salomon Asset Management. &quot;Itprovides a potential for a stable revenue and income sourceto offset volatile earnings from other parts of the firm,&quot; headds.   Mr. Salomon, 54 years old, had headed stock research atthe Salomon Inc. unit since 1975. Last year, Mr. Salomon hadquietly started getting involved in the firm's burgeoningmutual fund business, managing the $85 million SalomonBrothers Capital Fund.   In his new post, Mr. Salomon will set strategy for thefirm's $6.5 billion in assets under management. (The firmalso manages an additional $11 billion in U.S. governmentassets, including those of the Resolution Trust Corp.)   Mr. Salomon, who is a descendant of one of the firm'sfounding partners, said in an interview that the unit willlook to launch new mutual-fund products. He said his biggestchallenge &quot;is to try and exact superior returns from themarket.&quot; Many fund managers have long failed to keep pacewith broad market indexes, disappointing investors.   Mr. Salomon says stock prices are currently overpriced.&quot;The market has been ahead of itself and is discounting avery favorable outcome in the economy,&quot; he said; he's lookingfor a correction. Many of the firm's funds have cashpositions of 10% to 15%, he said; higher cash positions canhelp funds buffer stock-market declines.   Before joining the firm in 1975, Mr. Salomon worked forU.S. Trust Co. of New York for 16 years, serving as seniorvice president and overseeing institutional investments. AtSalomon, he is perhaps best known for creating the firm'sannual survey of financial and tangible assets; this tracksthe performance of everything from stocks and bonds to U.S.farmland, coins and Chinese ceramics.   Meantime, Mr. Salomon's move paved the way for the firm tomerge its stock research and high-yield junk-bond researchdepartments. The director of the combined research group willbe James D. Crandell, and its deputy director, Joseph C.Bencivenga.   The combination effectively formalizes what had been agrowing working relationship between the two groups sincelast year. &quot;It allows us to disseminate that information totwo different groups of investors who generally don't talk toeach other,&quot; Mr. Bencivenga said.</TEXT></DOC>
