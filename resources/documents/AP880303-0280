The coach was not identified, but Olympic sources and Canadiannews media said he was Dumitru Focseneanu, the Romanian bobsledcoach whose team had 27th and 30th place finishes at the WinterOlympic Games in Calgary last week.   ``We're trying to find out what he really wants to do,'' Maffresaid.   The bobsled coach reportedly refused to board a bus taking the22-member Romanian team to Calgary airport Monday night and soughtrefugee status.   The federal Immigration Department was handling the case. TheSoviet Union filed an angry protest over an immigration hotline setup in Calgary to handle emergencies and possible defection cases.   The Romanian was the only known defector among more than 1,800Olympic athletes and 1,000 coaches and officials from 57 countries.But three Romanian speed skaters and their coach left Calgaryabruptly the day before the Games began amid speculation theathletes planned to defect.   City Police Superintendent Len Esler said the defectorapproached two police officers at the athletes' village at theUniversity of Calgary about 9:30 p.m. Monday and ``requestedpolitical asylum.''   Esler said the man was taken to a police station whereimmigration officers picked him up. He refused to give the man'sname ``for his safety and the safety of his family.''   Focseneanu was in Calgary last December during a bobsled WorldCup competition.   The Romanian Embassy in Ottawa refused to comment.   Wilf Lindner, manager of the Calgary immigration center, saidthe man would be allowed to stay only after a medical examination,a security check into his background and an Immigration Departmenthearing.   ``All decisions are made on a case-to-case basis,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
