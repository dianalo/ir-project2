A major loss for the Liberal Democrats would increase pressurefor a general election and for a change of leadership in thescandal-plagued party.   The Japan Broadcasting Corp. and Kyodo News Service said theirprojections indicated the Liberal Democrats were certain to losetheir majority in the House of Councillors, the upper house ofJapan's two-chamber Parliament. Voters were deciding half of thehouse's 252 seats in Sunday's balloting.   Final official results were not expected until Monday evening.   A heavy turnout by Japan's 90.3 eligible voters reflected strongfeelings over a new sales tax, an unpopular farm policy and stockand sex scandals that have eroded the popularity of the governingparty, according to opinion polls.   ``The situation is extremely severe,'' Hashimoto said in anearlier interview Sunday. ``Though the final results are not inyet, it appears our old pattern is not working.''   Takako Doi, chairwoman of the main opposition Japan SocialistParty, which was leading in the projections, told reporters: ``Thisis the result of the people's choice.''   By late Sunday night, the Japan Broadcasting Corp. projected theresults for 88 of the 126 seats being contested in the House ofCouncillors.   It said 25 would go to the Liberal Democrats, 34 to the leftistSocialists, six to the centrist Clean Government Party, two each tothe Communists and the conservative Social Democrats, eight toindependents and 11 to minor parties.   Kyodo News Service gave similar projections, and both the newsservice and the Japan Broadcasting Corp. predicted that the LiberalDemocrats would not win the 54 seats they needed to maintain asimple majority in the upper chamber.   Although the Socialists were doing well in the projections, amajority in the upper house will remain out of their reach becausethey would need to win 84 seats and they ran only 54 candidates inthe election.   The Liberal Democrats went into the election with 142 seats,compared to 43 for the Socialists and 23 for the Clean GovernmentParty. A political party needs 127 seats for a simply majority inthe House of Councillors and 139 seats to control all 16 permanentstanding committees in the house.   The Socialists have led efforts to create an oppositioncoalition with the Clean Government Party, the DemocraticSocialists and the leftist Socialist Democratic Federation, whichnow has no seats in the upper chamber.   If the Liberal Democrats lose control of the upper house, theywill find it harder to pass legislation. But the party holds 293 ofthe 512 seats in the more powerful lower house, where electionsneed not be called until July 1990.   The Liberal Democrats have produced all of Japan's primeministers since it was formed in 1955. But a poor showing by PrimeMinister Sousuke Uno's Liberal Democrats could increase pressure onUno, in office less than two months, to resign and lead to earlyelections for the lower house of Parliament. A Liberal Democraticloss there could bring Japan a Socialist-led government, since thelower house elects the prime minister.   The Liberal Democrats, who represent conservative interests inJapan, have been hurt by a scandal centering around the RecruitCo., a publishing conglomerate that was accused of doling outmillions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political donationsto obtain favors.   Disclosures in the scandal led to the resignations of threeCabinet ministers and Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita.   Shortly after he succeeded Takeshita June 2, reports began toappear that Uno had kept paid geisha mistresses, igniting criticismfrom women's groups.   The geisha scandal forced Uno to keep a low profile duringcampaigning, strengthening his image as a caretaker who will remainin office only until Oct. 31, when Takeshita's term as partypresident would have expired.   Farmers, traditional supporters of Uno's party, also revoltedagainst its moves to open Japan's agricultural market wider toimports.   The Socialists rallied voters against a new 3 percent sales taxthat was heavily backed by the governing party.   The Socialists, putting forward a record number of womencandidates, took advantage of housewives' anger over the tax, whichwas bulldozed through Parliament by the governing party last yeardespite an opposition boycott. The tax, part of a sweeping taxreform, took effect April 1.</TEXT></DOC>
