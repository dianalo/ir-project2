The Big Board said short interest fell 8.8%, or 44,685,032 shares, to 465,465,564 shares from 510,150,597 shares Oct. 15.    But analysts noted the amount of stocks held in short positions was still surprisingly large, indicating the swiftness of the market's drop trapped some traders in their positions. They added that increased shorting activity in individual stocks in the teeth of the decline may have helped make up for any slowdown in shorting related to program arbitrage. Short interest in the previous month was near the record level set in August.    The American Stock Exchange said short interest fell 10.6%, or 3,863,862 shares, to 32,494,029 shares, down from the adjusted 36,357,891 shares in mid-October. The previous month's level was also near record levels.    A short sale is the sale of borrowed stock. While a substantial short position reflects heavy speculation that a stock's price will decline, some investors consider an increase in short interest bullish because the borrowed shares eventually must be repurchased.    The seller in a short sale expects a price decline that would enable the purchase of an equal number of shares later at a lower price for return to the lender. The short interest is the number of shares that haven't been purchased for return to lenders.    Fluctuation in short interest of certain stocks also may be caused partly by arbitraging.    In a major method of securities arbitrage, a profit can be made when a company's stock is to be exchanged for that of another, or for a new issue, in a proposed merger. The profit opportunity arises when the stocks sell at disparate prices.    An arbitrager may make a per-share profit by buying stock of one company involved in the prospective merger and selling short the stock of the other.    Volume during the month just ended was historically high, a factor that thinned the short interest ratio to 1.62 days from 2.87 days during the period. The ratio measures the number of trading days at average volume it would take to cover the short interest total.    Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott, noted the short interest readings this month are particularly interesting for individual stocks, in light of the curb on program-related activity.    &quot;We don't have to use quite as many filtering products -- now the numbers are a little bit purer gauge of sentiment,&quot; he said.    Analysts noted that the total short position as of Nov. 13 may be attributed broadly to traders who couldn't cover themselves in the drop and new positions opened to try to take advantage of or hedge against a further decline.    Utility stocks -- which have been favored by short-sellers for months -- still accounted for nearly half of the biggest short positions Nov. 13.    &quot;People who were betting negatively on the utilities got a surprise,&quot; said Philip B. Erlanger, chief technical analyst at Hartford, Conn.-based Advest Inc. He noted that the utilities have been holding up somewhat better than the general market during the downdraft.    Mr. Erlanger said that the &quot;at-risk ratio,&quot; a figure he devised to remove issues subject to arbitrage, slipped to 1.52 from 2.78 the previous month, largely because of overwhelming volume during the period.    Some of the biggest short interest volume increases were in blue-chip stocks, including International Business Machines Corp., Eastman Kodak Co., Exxon Corp. and Coca-Cola Co.    But Mr. Erlanger and others said that the increases might reflect straight hedging by portfolio managers and individuals rather than familiar arbitrage-related trades.    The biggest volume decrease on the Big Board was logged by Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., the Hartford, Conn.-based insurer that was the biggest gainer the previous month. Short interest in Aetna fell to 394,300 shares from 8,198,768 shares the month before.    The adjacent tables show the Big Board and Amex issues in which a short interest position of at least 100,000 shares existed as of mid-November or in which there was a short position change of at least 50,000 shares since mid-October (see accompanying illustration -- WSJ Nov. 20, 1987). </TEXT></DOC>
