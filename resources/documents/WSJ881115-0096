Ciba-Geigy's investment is its first in a biotechnology company. The Swiss pharmaceutical concern, however, has participated in a venture with Chiron to develop a vaccine for the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus since 1984.    Under the agreement, Ciba-Geigy will buy one million newly issued Chiron shares for $20 each, a 51% premium over Friday's closing price of $13.25. The new shares will increase Chiron's total shares outstanding to about 12.7 million. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Chiron closed at $14.25 a share, up 75 cents.    &quot;It's a sign of the times,&quot; said Kathleen Behrens, a securities analyst who follows the biotechnology industry for Robertson, Colman andamp; Stephens in San Francisco. &quot;Since last year's {stock-market} crash it has been very difficult to go to the markets to finance biotechnology companies,&quot; she added, noting that only one biotechnology company has made an initial public offering in the past year.    Chiron officials said it wasn't so much market conditions as the chance to strengthen relations with Ciba-Geigy that prompted the private placement. &quot;A private placement is often very attractive regardless of market conditions because you don't have to pay investment-banker fees and you often get a premium,&quot; said a Chiron spokesman. Besides, he added, &quot;the combination of private and public is something companies have been doing since the industry started in the 1970s.&quot;    Chiron, which specializes in using recombinant-DNA techniques to develop vaccines and diagnostics for infectious diseases, already has a major corporate partner in Johnson andamp; Johnson of New Brunswick, N.J. Johnson, a maker of pharmaceuticals and consumer health-care products, holds 718,000 Chiron shares -- a 5.7% stake after the Ciba-Geigy investment. Like Johnson, Ciba-Geigy won't be represented on Chiron's seven-member board.    Ciba-Geigy's relationship with Chiron goes back several years. In April 1987, Chiron and Ciba-Geigy expanded joint research efforts to develop an AIDS vaccine, by starting a joint venture called Biocine Co. This year, Biocine started human clinical trials in Geneva of its genetically engineered vaccine, called insulin-like growth factor, or IGF-1.    Chiron also is selling or developing vaccines or diagnostic tests for various strains of hepatitis and malaria. Chiron's vaccine for hepatitis-B, which is being produced and marketed in an agreement with Merck andamp; Co. of Rahway, N.J., was the first vaccine produced by gene-splicing to be approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.    &quot;Chiron is the best at recombinant vaccines in the business right now,&quot; said Ms. Behrens.    Separately, Chiron said it reacquired from Sweden's Pharmacia AB the rights to market in the U.S. superoxide dismutase, or SOD, an enzyme used to help organs recover from the interruption of blood flow because of heart attack or surgery.    Chiron didn't disclose the terms of the transaction. Chiron and Pharmacia have been working jointly to develop SOD since 1986. In addition to marketing rights for SOD products in the U.S., Chiron holds rights for Canada, South America, Japan and other Asian countries. Pharmacia will retain the rights to market SOD products in Norway, Sweden and other selected markets. Gurenenthal GmbH of West Germany, holds market rights in other European countries. </TEXT></DOC>
