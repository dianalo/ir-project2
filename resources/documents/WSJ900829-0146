As recently as 1987, only six of the 12 EuropeanCommunity countries specifically promised to reimbursedepositors of insolvent commercial banks. Today three ECmembers (Ireland, Greece and Portugal) still lack this cover,but an enabling act is before the Irish parliament, and theothers will follow, under pressure from the EuropeanCommission.   Germany's is the oldest of the EC's existing schemes. Itwas set up in 1966, then strengthened and extended after theHerstatt failure of 1974. But the principle of bankprotection is, of course, far older. In Germany, more than500 local Sparkassen (savings banks) have historically beenbacked by city or county authorities, which have legalobligations to ensure that their associated banks remainviable.</LP><TEXT>   In Britain, where there have been no large-scale bankfailures in more than a century, the Bank of England relieduntil 1982 on careful supervision of a not very competitiveoligopoly, combined with willingness to act in extremis aslender of last resort.   In France it was official policy for many years, up tillthe middle 1960s, to restrain competition between banks, witha view to avoiding erosion of their profits and consequentenfeeblement. National deposit insurance was introduced in1980.   Traditionally, guarantees by European governments, centralbanks or banking associations have been implicit andunspecific. It was widely felt that explicit guarantees wereunnecessary, and possibly harmful since they could encourageimprudence -- an argument championed by Franklin Rooseveltand, some would say, vindicated by the recent history of U.S.thrifts.   The arrival in Europe of explicit though limitedguarantees thus marks a retreat from traditional practice.However, formal guarantees can have a very helpful influenceon depositors' behavior. They discourage panic withdrawals,which could be based on baseless rumor, or on pessimismunjustified unless self-fulfilling.   Europe's guarantee schemes provide limited cover for eachdepositor, generally excluding interbank and other wholesaledeposits. But the German commercial bank scheme isexceptional in that each depositor is covered for up to 30%of a bank's equity capital, as shown in its latest publishedaccounts. Maximum cover per depositor thus exceeds 1.5% ofthe bank's total loan book, which is restricted to 18 timesequity. Few customers would hold deposits bigger than this inany one bank; in practice, therefore, cover is virtuallyunlimited.   Elsewhere, guarantees are more or less tightly restricted.In most countries, a large customer thus stands to loseheavily from a bank's failure, unless the government orcentral bank sees fit to supplement the guaranteed indemnity.When Herstatt failed, the German banking association set upan emergency fund to reimburse small depositors, but biggercreditors lost up to 55% of their money. It remains prudentfor corporate customers to observe the caveat emptor rule: Tohelp them, specialist rating agencies are consequentlybecoming more widespread in Europe.   In the U.S., the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation wasset up in 1934. Comparable bodies in other OECD countriesdate from the 1960s or later. America's early conversion tothe practice of deposit insurance reflects its banks' extremetrauma in the early 1930s, but also the fact that insuranceschemes are inherently best suited to a fragmented bankingsystem.   Paradoxically, large banks are the biggest contributors toguarantee schemes by which they themselves could not hope tobe rescued if it came to the crunch. While U.S. bankscontribute around $2 billion a year to the FDIC, some leadingmoney center banks have domestic deposits of $25 billion ormore. Annual contributions by German commercial banks to theDeposit Security Fund are estimated at less than $65 million;each of the &quot;big three&quot; has deposits of more than $50billion. The French scheme, designed to cover claims of up toabout $77,000, clearly aims only to rescue customers of thesmallest banks.   In fact, deposit-protection schemes are not set up to copewith the insolvency of a major bank, for which other remedieswould be needed. In several European countries this isrecognized by capping scheme contributions, so that thebiggest banks do not pay in full proportion to their size.   One beneficial effect of deposit protection is achievedeven when a country's banking system stays trouble-free.Guarantees are of abiding value to small banks that mightotherwise be considered less secure than the big names. Thisappearance may be deceptive. A tiny bank may well have bettercontrol over its affairs than a sprawling giant. Neverthelessthe fact remains that it has limited asset diversity, and theperception remains that it could conceivably be allowed toevaporate, while the giant could not.   In Spain the Deposit Guarantee Fund, established in 1977,not only insures deposits but also has powers to acquiretroubled banks for liquidation or resale. Many foreignbanking groups have gained a foothold in Spain by buyingrescued banks from the fund. In Germany the privatecommercial banking sector embraces more than 200 independentbanks and, according to one senior official, &quot;the DepositSecurity Fund is designed to up hold the diversity of theprivate banking system.&quot;   Why is Europe, increasingly a continent of few but largebanks, adopting habits that seem more apt for the U.S.?Clearly one reason is the desire of consumers for fullerprotection and indemnity across the board. Another is thatfor various reasons, including consumer pressure, Europeanbanks now live in a much more competitive environment thanthey did a quarter-century ago. These tougher conditionserode the margins of safety in banking operations. Today thebanker's temptation is to enhance profits through riskieractivities. Many argue that guarantees strengthen thistemptation by insulating customers from the risks. CouldEurope's new safeguards facilitate debacles like those of theU.S. thrifts?   It seems unlikely. From 1934 until the recent disasters,FSLIC insured thrift deposits with few untoward effects. Itwas only after 1980 that passengers slipped between theunmoored boat of deposit rates and the dock of fixed-ratemortgages; while 1980s supervisory procedures could nothandle far-reaching changes in the thrifts' business methods.   Across Europe, banking like other business sectors hastended to coalesce into fewer bigger companies. Within theCommunity, cross-border integration seems likely to carrythis trend further. But a directive on its way from Brusselswill soon require all 12 countries to maintain depositprotection schemes. These will offer reassurance and enhanceconfidence in an age of volatility. They should alsoencourage the independent survival of small local banks, evenas their bigger brethren continue to merge.   ---   Mr. Sibley is a member of the International Stock Exchangeand the Society of Investment Analysts in London.   ---                    Sound as a Krone...
