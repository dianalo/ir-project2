Martyn Forrester claims his ``Survival Skills Handbook''includes the first ``how-to'' guide for hijack hostages.   ``The book is about survival in any situation ... whether yourplane has crashed or whether you're in a situation where you aretrapped, you're a hostage,'' he said in an interview.   ``The main premise of the book is that you'll survive if youthink you can. No situation shows that better than the hostagesituation.''   Most of Forrester's suggestions involve coping mentally withbeing held hostage.   Captives should ``keep busy with mental activity and avoiddepression,'' he writes. ``Always remember that the captors cancontrol your body, but they cannot control your mind.''   Hostages should try to establish a rapport with theirkidnappers, he advises, but adds that ``logic is not valid in thissort of situation: relate on an emotional level.''   Communicating with a nervous, trigger-happy hijacker can berisky, he says, but ``it's something that's worth trying if youphysically can.''   The book also suggests precautions for international travelersworried about hijackers: don't wear military-style clothing orcarry military identification papers.   ``You'd be surprised at the number of people who get onairplanes in camouflage military jackets and dog tags around theirnecks,'' Forrester said.   The book also recommends that air passengers carry familyphotographs in their passports or wallets.   ``They will make you appear a family person with dependents, anda less likely candidate, it is hoped, for execution.''   Forrester said the book's section on hostages and hijackingscontains ``tried and tested'' ideas, as well as ``theoreticalmodels of people who are dealing in this field, ... clinicalpsychologists who are actually involved in hostage situations.''   With hijackers becoming more sophisticated, he said, potentialvictims need to be better prepared.   In a hijacking, he said, ``what you can do to physically helpyourself is incredibly limited. But what you can do to keepyourself sane is entirely up to you. You either help yourself oryou don't.''   Forrester, 35, says he gained his expertise while undergoingmilitary training courses in Britain.   He has never been involved in a hijacking, and admits hisexpertise is more on the techniques, but an expert on terrorism whoreviewed Forrester's suggestions agrees that publishing them is agood idea.   Bernard Adamczewski of the London-based Institute for the Studyof Terrorism found the advice for hostages sensible ``provided youcan take it in.''   ``Most of such advice is really common sense,'' he said in aninterview, ``and some people can't be calm in such circumstances.''   While mental preparation is important, Adamczewski said, thebook's best advice is that international airline passengers shouldcarry as little identification with them as possible.   ``The Survival Skills Handbook'' is available in Britain andother English-speaking countries, and Forrester hopes to publish itin the United States soon.   He maintained that with his advice, travelers will at least beable to find comfort in the fact that they have done something toprotect themselves.   ``They can actually think: `Right, I'm scared about the journey.I can take those labels off my suitcase. I can make sure I've got anice picture of my wife and kids, or husband, in my wallet. So atleast if I am stuck in that situation, I've done what I can,''' hesaid.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Fri PMs June 3</NOTE></DOC>
