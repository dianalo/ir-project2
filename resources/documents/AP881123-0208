Until recently, owners of corporate bonds or bond mutual fundshad just two main perils to consider.   The first was credit risk, the chance that an issuing companymight fall on hard times and find itself unable to pay interest onschedule or repay the principal when its bonds matured.   Credit risk can be minimized by limiting yourself to bonds oftop-quality companies, as measured by their credit ratings andreputation, or by investing in a mutual fund with a widelydiversified bond portfolio.   The second big question was market risk _ the possibility thatincreases in inflation and interest rates would depress the marketvalue of all outstanding bonds. This concern could be mitigated ifyou bought bonds with a firm intention to hold them to maturity,when they would be paid off at face value.   Now, thanks to the spreading popularity of leveraged buyouts,there is a third hazard to consider.   Even if a company is prospering and interest-rate conditions arebenign, its bonds can fall suddenly in value if a buyout is proposedthat would load the business down with new high-yield, or ``junkbond'' debt.   In the face of huge new buyout proposals lately for companiessuch as RJR Nabisco, diversification within the corporate bondmarket wasn't much help. Most corporate bonds fell amid the growingperception of takeover risk.   The investing institutions that dominate the bond market haveraised loud protests, and a few recent bond issuers have attachedprovisions to their offerings providing holders with some protectionin the event of a buyout.   In the meantime, what should individual investors do about thissituation?   Avoiding takeover event risk is relatively simple _ put yourmoney in something other than corporate bonds where a takeover isimpossible or at least unlikely.   ``Consider event risk, and suddenly predictability isn't boringany more,'' declared one investment firm in an advertisement thisweek touting securities of federal government agencies.   U.S. Treasury securities are safest of all from takeover risk,just as they are from credit risk. For mutual fund investors, thereare numerous funds that limit themselves to government securities.   Analysts at Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. point out that some types ofcorporate bonds remain unlikely to be threatened by takeovers.   ``Generally safe to buy are the bonds of the nation's largestcorporations _examples are IBM, Exxon and DuPont,'' Sandamp;P said in itsweekly publication The Outlook.   Most banks and regulated utilities, while they may becomeinvolved in other types of mergers, are also regarded as improbablecandidates for leveraged buyouts.   If you want to switch money out of a corporate-bond investment tosomething else not affected by buyout risk, Sandamp;P suggests you mightwant to take action before yearend if your tax circumstances warrantdoing so.   Any loss you realize can be used to offset capital gains youmight have to report.   Beyond that, up to $3,000 in losses can be written off againstyour other income. If your overall loss is greater than $3,000, thebalance is carried forward to future years.   Assuming that the markets function the way they are supposed to,corporate bonds that are most vulnerable to takeover event risk willbe priced in the future at levels that reflect that risk.   The resulting high yields may prove attractive to investorswilling to gamble that no buyout will occur. But people whose primeconcern is safety will be advised to stay away.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Thurs Nov 24</NOTE></DOC>
