Five of the system's 73 plans -- those in New Jersey,Vermont, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Blue Shield ofWestern New York -- have a negative net worth, according tofilings with their state insurance departments. Six otherplans -- in Massachusetts, New Mexico, Maryland, Delaware,Rochester, N.Y., and New York City -- don't meet arule-of-thumb measurement used by many regulators to gaugethe minimum amount of funds that should be available to meetunusual claims expenses.</LP><TEXT>   The danger is that one or more of the plans could fail,leaving their policyholders to pay their own medical bill --as was the case last fall when Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shield ofWest Virginia collapsed, leaving behind $50 million in unpaidmedical bills. Of the 11 weak plans, only Blue Cross andamp; BlueShield of Maryland would be covered by a state guarantee fundin the event of an insolvency, according to data from theNational Association of Insurance Commissioners.   Some states, such as Massachusetts, prohibit hospitals anddoctors from turning to patients for payments, although theycould pass the costs along through rate increases. And manyBlue Cross andamp; Blue Shield customers could have trouble gettinginsurance elsewhere, as the plans often serve as insurer oflast resort for the sick and the elderly.   For its part, the Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shield Association isworking to join weak plans with stronger ones and is givingthe plans instructions on how best to cope with the nextdownturn in business.   To be sure, the rule-of-thumb measurement used by manyregulators is only a starting point when evaluating thehealth of a plan. It doesn't take into account other factors,including the status of a plan's investment portfolio andwhether it is losing or gaining market share. In addition,the measurement doesn't reflect a plan's mix of business orits local regulatory environment, each of which can mean alower capital level than other plans. And many plans pointout that their position is improving. Of the 11 plans withlow surplus, nine made additions to surplus last year.   Nonetheless, the poor financial condition of some of theplans underlines weaknesses in the Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shieldsystem itself. Not only does the association, which licensesthe Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shield trademarks, lack the financialresources to help out troubled plans but, as a body, it hasshown little inclination to crack the whip over its weakerplans, according to insurance consultants.   The various Blue Cross committees that decide the nationalassociation's policies are composed of representatives ofBlue Cross plans nationwide. &quot;They are sometimes reluctant todo unto others what may happen to them,&quot; says Nancy Turnbull,deputy commissioner of insurance in Massachusetts. In alawsuit filed on behalf of 10 hospitals that were not paidwhen the West Virginia plan collapsed, the nationalassociation was accused of negligence.   Certainly the Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shield system should be inbetter shape at this point. The highly cyclical healthinsurance business has just had two consecutive profitableyears, a period when the majority of plans have returned tofinancial health following a severe downturn in the businessbetween 1986 and 1988.   &quot;Plans that have weak capital structures now will besorely challenged to manage through&quot; the next downturn in thebusiness, admits Douglas Peters, senior vice president of theassociation. He adds that &quot;the predictions are that this yearwill be profitable but that the business will turn down in1992.&quot; Most of the weak plans will be merged or form jointventures with stronger plans, he expects.   The failed West Virginia plan, for instance, is in theprocess of being merged, but many of its policyholders arestill being asked to foot their own bills.   People who buy insurance independently, rather thanthrough a company, are most directly at risk in the event ofan insolvency. For those who are insured through their jobs,employees of small and medium-sized companies generally havea higher risk of being stuck with medical bills thanemployees at larger companies. Big concerns usually areself-insured, using a plan for administrative services only.   Regulators and the association identify weak plans bymeasuring the numbers of weeks of claims that a plan couldpay out of its surplus funds if it were liquidated. Surplusis the term that describes the difference between assets andliabilities under a conservative method of accounting used byinsurance companies when reporting to state insurancedepartments. This is similar to -- but more restrictive than-- net worth or shareholders equity for most companies.   Although many states don't require insurance companies tohold much capital, many regulators believe it is prudent forBlue Cross andamp; Blue Shield plans to be able to cover a bareminimum of between four and six weeks of claims from surplusif the plan were liquidated. Others are even moreconservative, believing such plans should have between twoand three months of surplus if necessary.   To be in good standing with the Blue Cross andamp; Blue ShieldAssociation, members should have enough surplus to meet atleast four weeks of claims under insurance accounting or sixweeks under standard accounting, according to a 1989 documentincluded in the West Virginia lawsuit against theassociation.   In addition to the 11 plans that do not have any net worthor don't have four weeks of surplus, there are six plans --in Georgia, the District of Columbia, Michigan, Utah, andBlue Cross of Western New York and Blue Cross Blue ShieldMutual of Ohio -- that have between four and six weeks ofsurplus under insurance accounting.   Blue Cross's Mr. Peters says the four-week measurement isonly a starting point and that the association may allowlower surplus levels for plans with a large degree of lowrisk businesses such as claims administration, in which theplan is merely handling the paperwork for self-insuredcompanies.   The association also looks at the regulatory environmentfor each plan. Some states, such as New York, where there arethree plans with less than four weeks of surplus, have beenwilling to let plans have low surplus levels rather thangrant them larger rate increases, for instance. The New Yorkplans are now required, however, to build six weeks ofsurplus by 1993, according to Charles Henricks, assistantchief examiner of the New York state insurance department. Headds that each of the three state plans with low surpluseswere recently granted large rate increases.   States that are exceptionally tough on rate increases tendto push insurers operating there to fulfill social missions,which in turn tends to produce little profit. Consultants saythat many of the plans with the lowest surplus levels are instates where they are expected to serve as insurer of lastresort.   &quot;There's a correlation between the states that are highlyregulated and plans that have had trouble,&quot; says James Reed,a former Blue Cross official who has studied the plans as anactuary at Milliman andamp; Robertson.   State regulators of some of the six plans that have fourto six weeks of surplus, including the District of Columbia,Ohio and Michigan, say they believe their plans' financialcondition has improved. A spokesman for the Utah plan saysthat over 50% of the plan's business is low riskadministration of claims. Thomas Kinser, president of theGeorgia plan, says 44% of his business is administrative. Aspokesman for the D.C. plan says 40% of its business is lowrisk.   Most plans argue that their surplus levels are higherunder generally accepted accounting principles than understatutory accounting, the method required by insurancedepartments for reporting purposes. That is because statutoryaccounting disallows investments in subsidiaries, equipment,furniture and other illiquid assets. Regulators exclude theseitems for filing purposes, in general, because they could notbe sold quickly to meet claims.   Andrew Cherkas, an actuary with Towers Perrin's insuranceconsulting group, says statutory accounting gives &quot;a goodearly warning signal to regulators that shows them whetherthey should be concerned.&quot; Some regulators say they take GAAPresults into consideration when reviewing a plan's financialcondition.   Under insurance accounting, &quot;a plan with less than fourweeks of surplus is probably reason for concern under anycircumstances,&quot; says John Porter, who has worked with anumber of troubled Blue Cross plans as head of TowersPerrin's insurance consulting group.   A plan with negative surplus, such as the New Jersey plan,which had a $124 million surplus deficit in 1990, cancontinue to operate as long as its cash flow covers itsclaims and expenses. &quot;You can keep paying yesterday's billswith tomorrow's money on your cash flow, provided you keepbusiness coming in,&quot; says Donald Daniels, president of theNew Jersey plan. That strategy, however, eventually caught upwith the West Virginia plan.   But surplus provides a cushion against losses, which canbe heavy during unprofitable cycles. According to a study byMilliman andamp; Robertson, losses among Blue Cross andamp; Blue Shieldplans have doubled over the last 20 years during downturns inthe business, typically every three years.   Mr. Peters says he believes the plans are more prepared toweather downturns now because the plans understand theunderwriting cycle better. But, according to Mr. Reed, theplans with low surplus will be the most at risk when thedownturn, expected this year or next, arrives.   ---   Suein Hwang contributed to this article.   ---                        Weak Pulse                                                                                                        Blue Cross-Blue Shield plans with less than four weeks ofclaims coverage in surplus at year end 1990                                                                                                                                    CLAIMS COVERAGE (In weeks)                             --------------------------                                                                                                                                     TOTAL*         ADJUSTED*                                                                                                        Blue Cross-Blue Shied of New Jersey                -2.6             -2.2                                                                                                        Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Vermont                   -1.9             -1.5                                                                                                        Blue Shield of Western New York                     -1.3             -1.2                                                                                                        Blue Cross-Blue Shield of New Hampshire             -1.3             -1.0                                                                                                        Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Rhode Island              -0.2             ---                                                                                                        Blue Cross-Blue Shield of Massachusetts             -1.0             1.4                                                                                                        Svce.
