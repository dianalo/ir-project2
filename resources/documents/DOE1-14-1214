<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-1214 </DOCNO><TEXT>The mechanism of toroidal Alfven oscillation excitation under compressionor expansion of magnetosphere is considered. Transformation of initialmagnetoacoustic impulse into an Alfven wave takes place due to disturbanceof azimuthal movement (convection) of magnetospheric plasma. Comparisonof calculated values of generated disturbance amplitudes to the observedones testify to a sufficiently high effectiveness of the proposed mechanism.</TEXT></DOC>
