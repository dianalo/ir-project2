The small-business lobby argues that education funds haveclimbed sharply in recent years, and that there should benoticeable improvement in education test results beforespending is increased. In Wisconsin, several business groupshave launched a joint anti-spending campaign against theeducation establishment. An Indiana small-business advisorygroup also readies a small-business agenda for school reform.</LP><TEXT>   A series of state surveys by the National Federation ofIndependent Business, the largest small-business trade group,suggest many owners of small firms feel they aren't getting agood return on their public school investment. &quot;The '80s wereas much a go-go decade for the education establishment as forjunk-bond artists,&quot; contends James Weidman, an NFIB official.&quot;However, the budgetary problems of the '90s and the failureof schools to demonstrate improved performance is ushering ina new era of accountability for the education community.&quot;   Small-business groups favor low- or no-cost &quot;systemic&quot;reforms that focus on greater accountability from schooladministrators and teachers, and revamped curricula thatstress &quot;basic competencies&quot; in reading and mathematics.   Small-business owners are most satisfied with educationalperformance of high-school graduates in Iowa (90%) and Maine(89%), the NFIB surveys suggest. They are least likely to besatisfied in Connecticut (68%) and Louisiana (71%) and Nevada(also 71%).   ---   ATLANTIC COAST states register hefty gains inHispanic-owned firms.   HOUSTON -- Moving to staunch a flood of bad news, CompaqComputer Corp. Chairman Benjamin M. Rosen said the companywill repurchase as many as 10 million shares of its commonstock and work to solve problems he characterized as a&quot;slithering multi-headed Hydra.&quot;   Speaking at a packed annual meeting, Mr. Rosen and JosephR. Canion, president and chief executive, tried to reassureshareholders that the personal computer maker's woes aretemporary. Compaq's stock plunged 27% Wednesday after thecompany announced that falling sales and other problems areexpected to cause second-quarter earnings to slip to lessthan 25 cents a share from $1.18 a share a year earlier.   &quot;These challenges will last months or maybe quarters, butthey won't last years,&quot; said Mr. Rosen, to a largely-supportive audience. &quot;Let's not lose sight of the fact Compaq iswell positioned in a growth industry.&quot;   Compaq officials attribute the stumble in part to turmoilin the dealer channel, saying the recent wave of mergers oflarge retailers has left a glut of personal computers on themarket. The company said second-quarter sales could slip asmuch as 15% to less than $733 million.   &quot;It's hard to know exactly when the inventory will pickup,&quot; Mr. Canion said, but acknowledged that it could hurtearnings well into the third quarter.   Compaq is hoping that recent price cuts of as much as 34%will soon reinvigorate sales and dispel a percep tion in theindustry that the company's machines are too expensive.Compaq sales should also get a boost within a few months fromthe introduction of several new products that analysts expectwill include a desktop computer based on Intel Corp.'s80486SX chip and new notebook computers.   And starting in 1992 and continuing throughout the decade,Compaq expects brisk sales of a new line of high-poweredcomputers based on reduced instruction set or RISC chips thatthe company announced in April as part of a 21-companycoalition called the Advance Computing Enviroment.   Nationally, the number of Hispanic-owned firms spurted 80%between 1982 and 1987, to 422,373 from 233,975, a new CensusBureau report shows. Posting the strongest growth wereseveral East and Mid-Atlantic Coast states, while states withtraditionally heavy Hispanic populations -- like Californiaand Texas -- showed more moderate gains.   New Hampshire led the nation with a 148% gain, though thenumber of Hispanic-owned businesses there remains low, atjust 224, and only 49 of them had paid employees in 1987.Virginia, with a 131% increase, and Georgia, with 123%,followed. West Virginia, bringing up the rear, had thesmallest growth, of 20%. Nebraska and Louisiana lagged with32% and 35% increases, respectively.   Regionally, the 10-state South Atlantic region, fromMaryland to Florida, posted the biggest increase, with adoubling in the number of Hispanic firms, while theMid-Atlantic region -- New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania-- followed with a 97% rise, and the five Pacific statesrecorded an 86% climb. Lagging were the seven West NorthCentral states, with a 58% increase; the four East SouthCentral states -- Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, andMississippi -- with 59%, and the West South Central region ofArkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas, at 60%.   California, with 132,212 firms, continues to dwarf otherstates, and represents one of every three Hispanic firmsnationally. The Big Four of California, Texas, Florida andNew York account for 75% of all Hispanic firms. The stateswith the fewest Hispanic businesses are North Dakota, with88; South Dakota, 109; Vermont, 118; Maine, 139; WestVirginia, 177; and Delaware, 184.   The number of Hispanic firms with paid employees, 82,908,jumped 111% between 1982 and 1987. But the number is onlyone-fifth the total Hispanic companies, indicating most firmsare small Mom-and-Pop operations.   ---   ILLINOIS LAWMAKERS are mulling a bill that would requiregrocers to put warning labels on all food items considered tocause cancer or birth defects. Under the House bill, modeledafter a 1986 California law, a panel of state regulatorswould determine which items merit labels telling consumers ofpotential health risks. Illinois grocers are lobbying heavilyagainst the proposed bill; they claim the California law is&quot;a huge never-ending monster&quot; because it sets arbitrarystandards and scares consumers needlessly. Butconsumer-advocate groups maintain the measure is needed tohelp protect consumers.   ---   SIZABLE ISSUE: Maryland may become the second state --after Michigan -- to protect the obese. Despite theopposition of small-business and other employer groups, whoconsider the measure a bit unwieldy, Maryland lawmakers areconsidering legislation to ban job discrimination based onsize. The proposal, backed by the National Association toAdvance Fat Acceptance, would outlaw size discriminationunless job qualifications require certain physical standards.The proposal also addresses such matters as availability ofplaces for large people to sit.   ---   TIRE TAX: Nebraska begins charging a $1 tax for every newmotor vehicle tire sold in the state. The tax is expected tobring in about $200,000 a year and will go into a fund to payfor grants to local governments for solid-waste managementand recycling. Beginning in July, a new annualwaste-reduction and recycling fee of at least $25 will beimposed on all state retail businesses with sales exceeding$30,000 a year.   ---   SOME STATES act to ease a small-business problem thatarose when Johnny and Joanie came marching home.   After the Mideast war ended, reservists and other militarypersonnel returned to their old jobs, many at smallbusinesses. But that meant many employees hired to fill theirspots had to be laid off, and they began drawing unemploymentcompensation. Consequently, small-business owners beganfearing their jobless insurance rates would skyrocket. For asmall business, a single unemployment case can sharply raisejobless insurance rates-for up to three years.   State legislatures, lobbied by small-business owners, aretaking note. Oklahoma lawmakers last month overwhelminglycleared a measure that spread the cost among all stateemployers of jobless compensation for employees laid off tomake way for returning reservists. The law went into effectApril 29. The North Carolina House has passed a similar bill,and lawmakers say the state senate is likely to approve it.   ---   SMALL TALK: State surveys by the National Federation ofIndependent Business find that members in Arkansas favor by a3-to-1 margin making parents liable for shoplifting by theirminor children. In Rhode Island, they overwhelmingly supportrepeal of recent legislation that requires a fire fighter tobe posted at certain restaurants and similar establishments.In Wyoming, members support a lottery and limited casinogambling in the state, but narrowly oppose the use of tripletrailers for a test period on interstate highways.</TEXT></DOC>
