Angola today rejected direct talks with the rebels, which itcalled ``puppets'' of South Africa, and said Angolan troops hadkilled 71 rebels in several clashes Aug. 1-7.   The South African government said about 2,000 of its troopsbegan leaving Angola Wednesday in accordance with an agreementaimed at ending the war there and granting independence toSouth-West Africa.   At the same time, UNITA, the National Union for the TotalIndependence of Angola, said its rebel fighters killed 35government troops and 15 Cuban soldiers while taking a southwesternAngolan city and army supply camp.   The rebels said they took control Tuesday of Chamutete in Huilaprovince. UNITA said five rebels were killed and 13 injured infighting. The claim, in a statement issued in Lisbon, Portugal,could not be confirmed independently.   South Africa supports the rebels in their 13-year war. Cubasupports Angola's Marxist government and has about 50,000 troops inAngola.   Under terms of an agreement announced Monday, South Africa is tohave its troops out of Angola by Sept. 1.   Cuba is eventually to withdraw its troops from Angola, and SouthAfrica is to grant independence to South-West Africa, also known asNamibia, where a guerrilla group known as the South-West AfricaPeople's Organization operates.   Neither rebel group is party to the agreement.   In Lisbon, Angola's official Angop news agency said today thatUNITA's exclusion from regional peace talks ``was logical, normaland necessary for the establishment of peace.''   But it said this did not rule out a program of amnesty to returnto society ``hundreds of Angolans who were unwittingly used toserve foreign interests and personal ambitions.''   Angop said the Angolan army killed 71 ``UNITA bandits'' and tooknine others as prisoners Aug. 1-7. It said rebels in the sameclashes killed 26 government troops and captured 17.   In Harare, Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe said PresidentEduardo dos Santos of Angola told the leaders of black-governednations neighboring South Africa that a timetable for thewithdrawal of the Cuban troops is still to be worked out. ``It isnot going to start now. It will start much later, perhaps after sixto eight months,'' Mugabe said.   Officials of Angola, Cuba and South Africa are to meet in twoweeks to negotiate a timetable for withdrawal of the Cuban troops.   The Citizen and other South African newspapers said SouthAfrican soldiers had begun dismantling a forward base at CuitoCuanavale, in southern Angola, gathering up battle wreckage andpreparing long-range G-5 guns for the 180-mile journey throughdense bush and sand back to South-West Africa.   Cuito Cuanavale, once an Angolan government garrison town, hasbeen a no-man's land between dueling artillery for the past eightmonths.   If agreement on Cuban withdrawal is reached, South Africa saysit will set Nov. 1 as the starting date for implementing a U.N.plan to end its 73-year rule over South-West Africa.   The plan envisions a 7,500-man U.N. peacekeeping force to bedeployed in Namibia for seven months while South African troopsgradually withdraw and elections are held for an assembly to drafta post-independence constituion.   Estimates of the cost of the U.N. operation have ranged as highas $1 billion. If the implementation process begins Nov. 1,elections could take place as early as June 1.</TEXT></DOC>
