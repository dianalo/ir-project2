The U.S. unit rose as the market interpreted Sunday'sstate election loss by Germany's ruling Christian Democraticparty as a negative for that country's economy, and asevidence of disarray in the Soviet Union continued to mount.</LP><TEXT>   Meanwhile, central banks stayed out of the foreignexchange market, traders said, because demand for the dollaris just too strong and widespread for intervention to havemuch impact.   The dollar peaked at 1.7690 marks in intraday trading, alevel not seen since it hit an intraday high of 1.7730 marksDec. 11, 1989. Late in the New York trading day, the dollarwas quoted at 1.7650 marks, up sharply from 1.7355 lateFriday in New York. The U.S. currency was changing hands at139.50 yen, up from 138.35 Friday. Sterling was trading at$1.6943, down 1.5% from $1.7205.   In Tokyo early Tuesday, the dollar was trading at 138.70yen, unchanged from Monday's Tokyo close. Meanwhile, the U.S.currency was trading at 1.7505 marks, up from Monday's Tokyoclose of 1.7432 marks.   Traders speculated that concerted dollar selling by thecentral banks will be delayed until the dollar shows a hintof weakness. They also said the central banks will have morefirepower after monetary officials of the Group of Sevenindustrial nations meet this weekend in Washington.   Only German and Japanese monetary officials have beenjawboning the dollar in recent days, and the absence ofcomment from other G-7 countries is fueling the market'sperception that the G-7 will have to restate, yet again, itssolidarity on exchange rates. The central banks are thoughtto be looking for &quot;inordinate swings&quot; in exchange rates, saidErik Lehtis, a dealer at Credit Agricole in New York. Thedollar's moves to higher levels are the market's way offinding out just where central banks will act, he said.   The dollar's advance yesterday was more subdued againstother currencies, except sterling, which was weak because ofU.K. political and interest-rate concerns.   &quot;I think the whole situation stems from the weakness ofthe Deutsche mark,&quot; said a dealer at Bank Julius Baer andamp; Co.in New York. &quot;The instability in Russia is hurting the mark;currency union is not being what everyone expected . . .people look for the safe haven.&quot;   Arnold Sherrer, chief foreign exchange trader at RoyalBank of Canada in New York, said he thinks the dollar couldrise to 1.8000 marks. &quot;I have to take it one step at a timeto see if corporate interest will take it higher,&quot; he said.   Underscoring the difficulty of German unification was anelection in which majority control of the German upperparliamentary house was snatched from German ChancellorHelmut Kohl's Christian Democrats and its coalition partner,the Free Democrats.   Voters pulled support from Mr. Kohl's Christian Democratsin protest of the chancellor's controversial tax increases,which were imposed to pay for reunification costs and theGerman contribution to the Persian Gulf war.   Left-leaning opposition Social Democrats captured thestate government of Rhineland-Palatinate in southwesternGermany, giving the party four pivotal seats and a newmajority in the national Bundesrat.   Weekend developments in the Soviet Union also hurt themark. Communist hard-liners requested a session of Parliamentwhere President Mikhail Gorbachev will be challenged aboutworsening ethnic and economic troubles.   Tomorrow, the Communist Party's guiding Central Committeeis slated to discuss Mr. Gorbachev's performance as partychief. Mr. Gorbachev said he expects criticism of hiseconomic reform programs. Meanwhile, Soviet Prime MinisterValentin Pavlov forecast widespread unemployment and a hugedrop in industrial production if the republics and thecentral government don't adopt an anti-crisis economicprogram.   At the same time, violence between Soviet Georgians andSouth Ossetians continued over the weekend, with more deathsreported. And local lawmakers in North Ossetia, which is inthe Russian federation, adopted a resolution calling for astate of emergency in part of the region.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $357.90 an ounce, up $1.20. Estimatedvolume was a light 1.6 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Tuesday, gold was quoted at $357.50 anounce.</TEXT></DOC>
