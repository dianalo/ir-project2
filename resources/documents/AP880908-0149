But Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., said he will insist that theWaste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP, meet standards still beingdeveloped by the Environmental Protection Agency before any nucleartrash is stored at the 10,000-acre site east of Carlsbad.   Troy E. Wade II, acting assistant energy secretary for defenseprograms, countered that limited storage of nuclear wastes isnecessary for an experimental five-year period to help scientistsdetermine compliance with EPA regulations.   Richard J. Guimond, director of the EPA's office of radiationprograms, agreed, saying experimental storage would ``betterinformation to make that determination.''   Richardson said there is no way the WIPP facility can beginreceiving the first of 210,000 tons of radioactive trash by nextmonth's target date, because the steel containers for transportingthe wastes have proved unsatisfactory in performance tests.   Wade said tests of a redesigned container are nearingcompletion, and certification is expected before the end of theyear.   Richardson presided over a House Energy and Commercesubcommittee hearing on a compromise bill that would withdrawfederal lands from other uses at the Carlsbad site, with permanentjurisdiction going to the Energy Department for operation of theWIPP facility.   WIPP is designed to provide permanent disposal of 6.3 millioncubic feet of radioactive garbage from nuclear weapons factories _such as plutonium-contaminated gloves, bottles, pipes and valves _in rock salt beds 2,150 feet below ground.   The trash would be transported to New Mexico by truck fromnuclear weapons plants around the country, the bulk of it from theIdaho National Engineering Laboratory and the Rocky Flats Plantoutside Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
