The major experimentaleffort has been concentrated on the divertor configuration in anticipationof H-mode operation of JT-60 in high power supplementary heating experimentsstarting in August 1986. Stable discharges with a divertor have beenobtained at I/sub p/ = 1.85 MA and anti n/sub e/ = 5.7x10/sup 19/ m/sup-3/. Radiated power from the main plasma in divertor discharges is reducedto one third of that in material limiter discharges. The electron densityhas a broad radial profile and the effective safety reaches q/sub eff/= 2.5. The neutral gas pressure in the divertor chamber becomes significantlyhigh and the control of particle recycling has been attempted.</TEXT></DOC>
