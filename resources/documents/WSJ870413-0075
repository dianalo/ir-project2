Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev has called the war a &quot;bleeding wound.&quot; A deputy Soviet delegate to the United Nations, Roland Timerbaev, blurted out at a luncheon at Columbia University's Faculty House last month that the war was &quot;a mistake. . . . We want to pull out our troops now.&quot;    But Soviet actions suggest that the seven-year-old Afghan war is more in its final years than its final days. Mr. Timerbaev was overheard later telling a luncheon guest, &quot;I should have explained that saying we had made a mistake was my personal opinion. Our government hasn't said so officially yet.&quot;    At a time when the Kremlin is apparently wrestling with how to get out of Afghanistan, U.S. policy is designed to increase Moscow's cost of continued occupation. American officials say they are trying to ensure the supply to guerrillas of antiaircraft Stinger missiles, which are taking a heavy toll against Soviet air forces. The U.S. also is working to shore up Pakistan, the indispensible conduit of arms and supplies, in the face of heightened Soviet threats and cross-border raids.    American experts compare the Soviets' current attitude toward its Afghanistan quagmire to that of the U.S. over Vietnam in 1968. They say Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's flexibility on a timetable for the removal of Soviet troops -- he's shortened his offer to 18 months from four years -- shows he wants to get out. But his inflexibility on any solution that would supplant Moscow's puppet leader, Najib, shows Moscow isn't yet ready to let Afghans rule Afghanistan.    &quot;He's reached that critical time when national leaders say time is no longer on our side,&quot; says Robert Legvold, an expert on Soviet foreign policy at Columbia University. He says that is like America's 1968 decision to &quot;Vietnamize&quot; the war and start withdrawing. However, he says Mr. Gorbachev is far from &quot;the point where he thinks he has to cut his losses&quot; by pulling out as the U.S. did.    Rep. Stephen Solarz (D., N.Y.), chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, says Mr. Gorbachev is pursuing a carrot-and-stick approach of pressing negotiations for a political settlement while increasing activity on the battlefield.    The Soviets are using crack units instead of regular troops to shut off crucial rebel supply channels from Pakistan. More critically, the Afghan government is more frequently carrying out cross-border bombing raids and planting terrorist bombs to weaken Pakistan's resolve.    Pakistan has good reason for acting as a conduit for weapons and supplies to the Afghan resistance. It wants to block Soviet expansion in the area and also continue to help the U.S. in ways that will protect its aid from Washington -- $4.02 billion over the next six years -- despite U.S. concern over its efforts to develop atomic weapons.    Moreover, the presence of three million Afghan refugees on its soil provides added incentive not to agree to any Soviet solution that could stir their violent rebellion. It wants a deal attractive enough to draw them home, removing the Afghans as a growing social and economic problem.    Still, the U.S. is aware that it must strengthen its support of Pakistan. &quot;Pakistan's willingness to resist Soviet threats is in some measure a function of its confidence in its relations with the U.S.,&quot; says Rep. Solarz. That is one reason why he and others in Congress support a proposed two-year waiver of the Symington amendment, which prohibits American aid to any country that refuses to abide by nuclear-nonproliferation requirements.    U.S. officials think that by keeping up military pressure in Afghanistan and showing Moscow that time isn't on its side, they can exploit a growing war-weariness in the Soviet Union.    Because the Soviet Union isn't a democracy, it doesn't face the public protest that prompted U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam. Still, social problems caused by the fighting are growing more evident.    The Soviet television program &quot;Youth and the World&quot; is reporting anger, frustration and other &quot;reentry&quot; problems of returning soldiers. Soviet scholars speak about young men looking for ways to avoid an Afghan assignment -- which in the early 1980s was seen as a way to promote a provincial farm boy's career or to bolster an officer's standing.    When soldiers recently were shown returning heroically from battle, they were being greeted at Krasnodar with gifts of stereos and carnations, which suggests that a Communist badge of honor is no longer enough in a war that Soviet mothers increasingly doubt is worth their sons' lives. </TEXT></DOC>
