On the ``CBS Evening News'' on Wednesday night, anchorman DanRather put it directly to Bentsen. ``Do you, or do you not, believethat Sen. Dan Quayle is qualified to be president of the UnitedStates,'' he asked.   Bentsen, the courteous Texas senator that he is, refused to givea yes or no answer.   ``He is not nearly as qualified as a lot of other heavyweights inthe Republican party,'' he said. ``I think everyone in the Congresswas shocked and surprised when he was chosen.''   Earlier Wednesday, Bentsen blasted Quayle at a rally inRiverside, Calif.   ``George Bush has a proven record of failure in the war againstdrugs,'' Bentsen said. ``And now he wants to turn that job over toDan Quayle. Now you just tell me any qualifications he has in thatregard. If George Bush is serious about the war on drugs, then whywould he choose Dan Quayle to lead it?''   He compared himself with his junior Senate colleague from Indiana.   ``My friends, there's an important difference here,'' he told thecrowd at the plaza outside the Riverside, Calif., city hall. ``Ithink millions of Americans would agree that Dan Quayle is notqualified to step in if he had to and be president of the UnitedStates of America.''   Bentsen went on to ridicule the Republican campaign for sayingQuayle would head the U.S. space program.   ``I see where Dan Quayle also wants to play a major role inNational Security,'' he said. ``Doesn't that shake you up a bit.That's a frightening thought. Are you ready for that?''   Bentsen talked of how Bush attended 17 national security meetingsand did not speak up against selling arms to Iran in exchange forhostages. ``But you know, when I think about (that) and I thinkabout Dan Quayle, I believe I'd rather have George Bush there notsaying anything ... than having Dan Quayle active at the nationalsecurity meeting,'' he said.   The Democratic campaign says Quayle remains a problem for Bush,and one that would make a difference if the polls tighten up.   ``We need to keep that issue in front of the voters,'' said MikeMcCurry, Bentsen's press secretary.   Bentsen planned to continue stumping in California today for thatstate's 47 electoral votes, more than any other.   A Los Angeles Times poll released this week put the Democraticticket 11 points behind, but campaign officials said they believedDukakis' new advertising campaign was already cutting that margin.   On Bentsen's schedule today was a foreign policy address to theWorld Affairs Council in Los Angeles.</TEXT></DOC>
