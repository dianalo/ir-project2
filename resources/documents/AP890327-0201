He has been asked about lyrical content so much, he wonders whywriters don't go beyond the subject and concern themselves with thepoetry in which the lyrics are expressed.   ``The opening of `Romeo Had Juliette' _ `Caught between thetwisted stars the plotted lines the faulty map that broughtColumbus to New York' _ you've got to admit that's a great openingline,'' Reed says. ``Forget about what it means and think of theflow of words. I wish people would notice. Don't you get some kindof pleasure when you listen to the language?   ``It's the first song I wrote for the album; it was the standardfor the rest. We had the luxury to go in and test out the studio.We tested it with `Romeo' and kept the cut we did for the record.''   Reed talked about his music in an interview at the AmericanSound Studio, where he and a band were rehearsing for a tour thatwill include an engagement at Broadway's St. James Theater.   That's a distance from Reed's early, scruffy days in the VelvetUnderground. The group was discovered in 1967 in New York'sunderground rock scene by the late pop artist, Andy Warhol, whopromoted them. It remained menacingly non-mainstream and didn'tbecome commercial. Later, though, it became a role model for punkrock. Working solo since 1970, Reed has had only one pop hit,``Walk on the Wild Side,'' in 1973.   Next November, Reed and John Cale, who also left the VelvetUnderground in 1970, will present an evening of songs in tribute toWarhol at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.   When he was cutting ``New York'' _ as lyrically street-tough asever but accepted in these days of rappers and U2 _ Reed wasn'texpecting media attention.   ``You can tell from listening we weren't thinking in terms ofradio airplay,'' he said.   ``Dirty Blvd.'' begins: ``Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel.He looks out a window without glass. The walls are made ofcardboard newspapers on his feet. His father beats him 'cause he'stoo tired to beg.''   Sire Records wanted to market a single, but Reed said he wasn'tthe type of person to sell singles. ``I pushed for `Dirty Blvd.'because I thought the single should at least be representative ofthe album. Look what happened,'' he said.   ``New York'' is selling better than any previous Lou Reed album,and is fast climbing the charts.   A liner note on ``New York'' says, ``You can't beat 2 guitars,bass, drum.'' The sound of the record was important to Reed, thatthe words be understandable and the guitars sound real.   ``Even though Segovia said an electric guitar is an abomination,what I like about an electric guitar is it can have all this bodyfrom the wood in it,'' he said. ``We had as one of our goals torecord it so it comes across that way and doesn't sound like asynthesizer _ thinned out and high endy.   ``One thing was not to have too many instruments. We wanted mysolos on guitar to be thick and beautiful. We wanted everything tobe heard. Of course, when there's not too many parts, there'snothing to hide behind. Any mediocrity is heard.''   His singing is basically talking, and has always been that way.``In my mind I would like to sing like Otis Redding or Al Green. Ican't, so I had to find a way I could use my range in my style.''   About the songs, Reed said he doesn't know why he wrote them.``I didn't sit and say, `I'm going to write about this and this.'   ``I had pieces of songs. Whatever I get first, I can't change,''he said. ``I can juggle around with later things, but the firstphrase or line of melody or title I get for a song, I can't changeit. I had the title `Dime Store Mystery' for 20 years. My wife,Sylvia, said, `When are you going to finish it?' It came up on thisalbum.   ``I like that song a lot. It had an odd effect on us when it wasrecorded. We were taken someplace else. I can't say where thatsomeplace was.   ``I guess people don't expect much out of records. They keepstaying on the plot and asking, `Who do you know in a welfarehotel?' `Dime Store Mystery' dispenses with plot.''   Reed said what the album is really about is the use of language.``That's what I'm really getting off on. There are phrases in thereas good as anything I've ever written.   ``It is pretty funny, some of it, I thought. It's not endlesslygrim.''   Reed took part in a benefit concert Paul Simon organized atMadison Square Garden to buy and equip a medical van to visit NewYork welfare hotels. ``Paul bought one with the proceeds of`Graceland.' Every penny from this concert went to get anotherone.''   Reed has been told that ``Last Great American Whale'' from ``NewYork'' will be on a Greenpeace album released in the Soviet Union.When he's asked if that's a real Indian myth, he says: ``It is now.It's an American Indian-Jewish myth. In Europe all the great mythshave been taken. Wouldn't it be nice if we could still write a mythand do it well enough so it held up? I wanted to try to do that.Why not?''   Asked about solutions to the big-city problems limned on ``NewYork,'' Reed says, ``We only had an hour. We'll get into solutionson Vol. 2, maybe.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, April 7-9</NOTE></DOC>
