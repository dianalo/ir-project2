The captors of Joseph Cicippio acknowledged a plea for mercyfrom his Lebanese wife in announcing the 48-hour postponement.   On Monday, after the group holding Lt. Col. William R. Higginssaid he had been hanged, Cicippio's kidnappers said he would bekilled unless Israel freed Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid by 6 p.m.Tuesday (11 a.m. EDT). The reprieve was announced two hours afterthe deadline.   Also threatened with death is Anglican church envoy Terry Waite,50, a Briton who disappared Jan. 20, 1987, after leaving his hotelin Moslem west Beirut to negotiate for the release of Americanhostages. There was no immediate word on his fate.   Obeid is a spiritual leader of Hezbollah, or Party of God, thefundamentalist Shiite Moslem group believed to be an umbrella forhostage takers. Hezbollah also is said to have two of three Israelisoldiers held prisoner in south Lebanon.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel suggested Tuesday thatIsrael was conducting negotiations with pro-Iranian Shiite groupsto win freedom for the soldiers and Western hostages in a trade forObeid and other Shiites.   Cicippio's Lebanese wife, Ilham, called a news conferenceTuesday and appealed to those holding her husband: ``In thesefateful minutes, I appeal to all of you to spare no effort to givehim a chance, so he will be able to prove to you that he isinnocent of all guilt.''   Her 58-year-old husband was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. He wasacting comptroller of the American University of Beirut.   In Washington, President Bush weighed a response to the killingof Higgins, a 44-year-old U.S. Marine officer on U.N. duty inLebanon. An administrative source said military action was ``in therealm of the possible,'' but officials said it was not an``attractive'' option.   Israeli warplanes swooped over Hezbollah strongholds in southLebanon at daybreak Tuesday but did not attack. Ground-to-airbarrages from Hezbollah militiamen in the ancient town of Baalbekscored no hits, police said.   On Monday, the Revolutionary Justice Organization issued astatement in Arabic, accompanied by a photograph of Cicippio,saying a time would be set for his ``execution'' unless Obeid wasreleased by 6 p.m. Tuesday.   It said at 8:15 p.m. (1:15 p.m. EDT) Tuesday, in a 13-linehandwritten statement in Arabic delivered to the Beirut newspaperAn-Nahar, that the deadline had been postponed. The statement wasaccompanied by an authenticating photo of Edward Austin Tracy,another American hostage held by the group.   The photograph showed Tracy, 58, from the waist up, in the firstpicture of him released since March 8. He had white hair and abushy white beard, and wore a navy blue track suit.   ``Due to the friendly appeals and sincere behests as well assome special factors and the moving plea by Cicippio's wife, theRevolutionary Justice Organization declares the unextendablepostponement of the execution deadline by 48 hours only,'' thestatement said.   ``Those concerned should realize that any other attempts towrest a new postponement will be futile.''   Revolutionary Justice's original threat to Cicippio arrived atAn-Nahar a few hours after a group calling itself the Organizationof the Oppressed on Earth said it had killed Higgins. It released apoor-quality videotape showing a man who appeared to be the Marineofficer dangling from a scaffold.   When the tape was made could not be determined. There have beenreports Higgins was killed months ago.   Hezbollah declared Tuesday, as it has before, that it has noconnection with hostage-taking, and said of the Israeli offer:``The only acceptable thing to us is that Sheik Abdul Karim Obeidand his two colleagues be released.   ``The United States and Israel jointly bear the responsibilityfor the kidnapping crime and the continuation of their detention.They also bear the responsibility for every reaction from the sonsof Islam and the oppressed in Lebanon and the world.''   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid and two associates Friday fromthe sheik's home in the southern Lebanon village of Jibchit.   The mainstream Shiite militia Amal, Hezbollah's rival, has saidit holds Israeli airman Ron Arad, captured after his plane crashedin south Lebanon while on a bombing mission on Oct. 16, 1986.Hezbollah is believed to hold two other Israeli soldiers capturedwhile on patrol in February 1986.   Israel has said it would trade Obeid and the other 50-60Lebanese Shiites it holds for the three soldiers and Westernhostages held in Lebanon, who totaled 17 with Higgins and includeeight other Americans.   Higgins commanded a 75-man U.N. truce observer team when he wasabducted Feb. 17, 1988, in south Lebanon.   Marrack Goulding, U.N. undersecretary-general for peacekeeping,left for Lebanon on Tuesday to try to recover the colonel's body.   Two anonymous telephone callers to news media in Cyprus andBeirut made the threats to Waite. The first deadline of 3 p.m. (8a.m. EDT) Tuesday passed and the second caller said it had beenextended until midnight (5 p.m. EDT).   Shamir's spokesman in Jerusalem hinted at indirect negotiationsthrough through the Red Cross or some other intermediary. InGeneva, the Red Cross denied involvement.   On Monday night, Bush issued ``an urgent call to all, allparties, who hold hostages in the Middle East to release themforthwith, as a humanitarian gesture, to begin to reverse the cycleof violence in that region.''   In Moscow, the Soviet Foreign Ministry said: ``We resolutelydenounce this inhuman action. The fact that the aggravation of thesituation in Lebanon, caused specifically by the abduction ofShiite leader Sheik Obeid by Israeli commandos, has led to anescalation of acts of violence and terror and evokes profoundconcern.''   The Hezbollah statement said the trade outlined by Israel'sdefense minister, Yitzhak Rabin, was ``a stupid move ... thatdeserves only ridicule and disdain.''   Hezbollah said it had ``nothing to do'' with Western hostages.   ``We see no comparison between Zionist invaders captured on ourland during a confrontation against the Zionist occupation thatmirrors the ugliest form of terrorim and the Zionist abduction of acleric while he was asleep at his home in his town inside Lebaneseterritory,'' Hezbollah said in the statement, which was telephonedto The Associated Press office in Beirut.   Israeli said Obeid was involved in planning attacks on Israeland had confessed to directing seizure of Higgins.   Aside from the Americans, the hostages in Lebanon are fourBritons, two West Germans, an Irishman and an Italian.   Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press, is the longest-held hostage. He was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   In Frankfurt, West Germany, the federal prosecutor's office saidTuesday those holding the two West German relief workers haddemanded the release of convicted hijacker Mohammed Ali Hamadi andhis brother, Abbas. Spokesman Hans-Juergen Foerster said thedemands were relayed to the West German Embassy in Beirut, but didnot say when or how.   A Frenkfurt court sentenced Mohammed Hamadi to life in prisonfor murder and air piracy in the 1985 TWA hijacking in which a U.S.Navy diver was killed and 33 Americans were held hostage 17 days.   Abbas Hamadi is serving 13 years for helping kidnap two WestGermans in 1987 to try to get his brother freed. The hostages laterwere released.</TEXT></DOC>
