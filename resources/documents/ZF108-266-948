 Today there are over 4,000CAT scanners -- at $1 million a system and $350,000 a year to operate -- inthe U.S.andM;Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems were introduced to the market in1984.andP;  They cost $1.0-$1.5 million each at the time, not counting $2 millionin installation costs and operating costs similar to CAT scanners, and stillthere were 1,500 of them installed by the end of the decade.andM;Even ultrasound imaging -- old by MRI standards -- did well, cracking thebillion dollar mark in annual sales last year and, through the use ofreal-time color-Doppler imaging, managed to advance the cause of medicine byanalyzing everything from blood vessels to eye tissue.andM;Portable grabsandM;market shareandM;Diminishing size and price -- to under 5 pounds and $10,000 -- have helpedsecure market growth for ultrasound in the 1990s.andP;  Portable units --including cart-mounted versions -- already account for 25% of sales.andM;Beyond the good and useful, more exotic kinds of imaging and scanning systems-- like Positron Emission Tomography -- were developed and brought to market.andM;But that was then.andP;  This is now.andP;  Now is communication and networking, andthose factors have begun to shape even the medical imaging market.andP;  For the1990s the market heat will come not from image capture, but from imagemanipulation, transfer, and storage.andM;PowerfulandM;secondary marketandM;In other words, in the wake of this $4 billion (1990 estimated worldwiderevenues) market for CAT, MRI, and ultrasound scanners -- for the scanningtechnology itself -- a secondary market of nearly the same size will developfor equipment and software to enhance the images, store and index them,transfer them about medical facilities and across the planet, and manipulatethem in ways to make diagnosis and treatment planning easier.andM;This growth will come in the workstations used as front ends to the scanners,the optical storage and retrieval systems that keep a record of the images,and the networks that shunt images from here to there.andP;  It will come inoutput devices, in image processing boards, and in 3D and 4D software.andM;Sometimes it will come as add-ons or enhancements to the scanners themselves,sometimes as standalone or separate systems.andP;  It will come as film digitizersand X-ray display screens, as microfilm replacement systems and optical diskjuke boxes, and as high resolution monitors, frame buffers, and controllers.andM;Multiple-useandM;systemsandM;Sometimes medical images will be only a part of what these systems will do:image storage and retrieval systems will be equally useful in documentarchiving, for instance, and workstations and PCs are increasingly being usedas display and data entry consoles for clinical laboratory equipment, likeblood analyzers.andM;Finally there will be nonmedical applications for computer graphics just asthere will be in all of industry: business graphics, office automation,desktop publishing, and the like.andM;&quot;From where I sit,&quot; notes Bull HN Information Systems systems engineer ScottKay, who studies the medical imaging market for Bull, &quot;the hot areas ofmedical imaging will be in networked workstations and in picture archival andcommunications systems.andP;  That's where the greatest immediate benefits -- interms of getting more for the money spent on the expensive diagnostic tools-- are to be found.&quot;andM;Demand willandM;fuel marketandM;While Kay admits that getting hospitals to ante up for centralized imagenetworks may take a while, given the parochial interests of each departmentneeding the images, he's still convinced that pent-up demand will overcomethe buying inertia and MIS technical hurdles to developing PACS (picturearchival and communications systems) installations.andM;Here we have a market, then, in significant flux.andP;  Sales of the majorscanning equipment are expected to slow.andP;  In the U.S., MRI sales have droppedbelow 10% growth, CAT sales are practically flat, and even ultrasound isgrowing less than 10% a year.andP;  Were it not for exports, maintenance, andupgrades there'd be little market left.andM;Not that this is surprising, given the demographics of the health careindustry.andP;  While health care costs were $620 billion -- thaths right, billion-- in 1989 and hospital costs 38% of that and expenditures grew 10%, theactual number of hospitals and hospital beds is declining.andP;  And is expectedto continue to decline, according to figures published by the Department ofCommerce.andM;Health careandM;costsandM;In case you somehow missed it, rising health care costs are on the minds oflegislators, corporate benefits executives, and hospital administrators --everyone agrees they're growing too fast.andM;The backlash against costs has even spread to questioning the diagnostic useof the expensive scanners themselves.andP;  In the December 1989 issues ofSpectrum, the magazine published by the Institute of Electrical andElectronics Engineers, the cover story on technology and health care reportsthat &quot;concerns grow about possible overuse of electronic sanners and othercomplex diagnostic and treatment equipment.&quot;andM;The article points out that 20% of CAT scans are for people with headaches --and yet virtually all patients with a headache and a normal neurological examhave normal CAT scans.andM;It doesn't take fearlessness, then, to forecast that the 1990s will be adecade of wringing more out of the existing technology as opposed to fundingand implementing radical breakthroughs.andP;  As a result, one can expect thefollowing for the first half of the 1990s:andM;Workstations hotandM;* Workstation sales into medical applications should exceed the averagecompound growth for workstations as a whole.andM;Workstations continue to increase in power, and thus are able to extractvalue from the embedded base of scanners.andP;  Today, about 10% of technicalworkstations are sold into the health care market.andP;  Along with workstationsales will come sales of software to help present 3D and 4D images forreconstruction of body tissue and simulation of occluded images.andM;Boards, softwareandM;* Image processing boards and software associated with those workstationsales and with image storage and retrieval will boom.andM;The software will include both general-purpose image enhancement programs andmedical imaging-specific software that helps doctors adjust images in waysthat aid diagnosis.andP;  Industry forecasts for image processing hardware andsoftware, depending on what's counted, range from $1 billion today to $500million.andM;About 25% of the more conservative figure, published by Yencharis ConsultingGroup, comes from medical imaging.andP;  The average compound growth rate for theoverall image processing market, according to Yencharis, will be 18% for theperiod from 1989 to 1993.andP;  The growth rate and coupling of image processingwith workstations has already begun to result in alignments between imagingboard makers and workstation vendors -- and watch for more to come.andM;Hi-tech x-rayandM;* Digitization of X-ray and growth of teleradiology will increase, spurred bythe availability of computer systems with enough storage and high enoughresolution and gray scale to replace film for diagnosis.andM;Today there are monitors on the market, for instance, that can handle 12-bitpixel depth for gray scale -- enough to substitute for film in radiology.andM;Image storageandM;* Growth of image storage and retrieval systems, not only for images but formedical records.andM;According to Temple Barker and Sloan, the 1989 market for electronic imagingwas about $1 billion and growing rapidly -- with sales to the health carecommunity accounting for 13% of that market (25% came from the government).andO;Indeed, the medical records people may welcome imaging here more even thandoctors.andM;The kinds of benefits resulting from institution of optical disk storagesystems over paper and microfilm reportedly run from decreased time forbilling -- 4 days at Detroit's Henry Ford Hospital -- and savings inmanpower, storage space, and other retrieval systems to reductions inincomplete charts -- 50% reported at the Maine Medical Center -- andsimultaneous access of records by various hospital personnel.andM;Of course it won't all happen at once.andP;  There are plenty of roadblocks.andM;Money, powerandM;slow advancesandM;For instance the widespread establishment of PACS hits walls of money andpower: for centralized image record keeping to succeed every department hasto ante up both budget dollars and local control.andP;  In addition, the lack ofstandards between systems will inhibit the integration of image systems nowin use in radiology, neurology, and medical records departments, not tomention the lab, ICU, and patient care systems.andM;Nor are the communications pipes wide enough.andP;  Since a single 2.5Kx2Kx12-bitimage takes up 7.5 MB of storage and isn't easily compressed, zipping imagesabout electronically will take lots of bandwidth.andP;  Right now, in thecommercial world, successful document image storage installations generallyhave their own networks -- since piggybacking image transfers on datanetworks would interrupt too much normal workaday data processing.andM;Finally, there's the user community -- the doctors, specialists, andadministrators -- who are not yet ready for the drastic changes automationcan bring.andM;demand patientandM;care will winandM;But for all the roadblocks, the medical market DOES have pent-up demand forelectronic imaging.andP;  With much of the sunk cost in expensive scanningequipment already in place, and with workstation and image processing costsdropping all the time, the incremental value of computer graphics andelectronic imaging to go with those systems -- in terms of both better andfaster diagnosis and faster billing -- is greater than the incremental costto provide it.andM;And, perhaps most important in the long run, the quality of medical care topatients will increase.andP;  In the long run, this will be the point thatconverts doctors and hospital personnel to advocates of graphics and imaging.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
