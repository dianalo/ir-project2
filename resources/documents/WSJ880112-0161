Ira Levy, chief of the embassy's non-immigrant visa branch, estimated it will receive 900,000 visa applications in the year ending Sept. 30, up from 700,000 in fiscal 1987. He said budget constraints will prevent the embassy from employing temporary staff, a move that alleviated the crunch during previous peaks in trans-Atlantic travel.    Sun-hungry Britons are snapping up package holidays to Florida in record numbers, travel agents say. U.S. holiday bookings generally are up between 50% and 100% from a year earlier, they add. &quot;Right now, we could sell as many {U.S.} holidays as we could get seats on airplanes for,&quot; said Kevin Ivy of the London travel concern Club 18-30. He is confident the boom will last &quot;as long as the dollar stays low.&quot;    Most experienced U.K. travelers already hold U.S. visas, which apply indefinitely. The British travel industry is more worried about Britons crossing the Atlantic for the first time. According to Mr. Ivy, &quot;vast numbers&quot; of first-time travelers account for a big chunk of U.S. holiday bookings.    To avert last-minute problems in obtaining U.S. travel documents, a trade group of British travel agents plans stopgap measures, such as a national courier service to collect and distribute customers' visas. </TEXT></DOC>
