Bruce Smart, undersecretary of commerce for international trade, said the relaxation of these barriers will help U.S. producers regain enough international business to create funds for research and development and thus &quot;keep ahead of the pack in both industrial and military technology.&quot;    The new rules typically will apply to semiconductors, microprocessors and other electronic equipment. But reexport licenses will still be required on exports of all foreign-made supercomputers that contain U.S.-made parts.    The new regulations will free foreign manufacturers of the need to obtain U.S. permission to export a product containing U.S. technical items to most countries if the value of those parts doesn't exceed 25% of the entire product's value. Currently, foreign buyers of these parts must apply for U.S. reexport licenses even if the parts' value is negligible. Those who don't obtain the required license face such sanctions as the loss of import privileges for U.S. products.    &quot;What this means is a French manufacturer who installs a U.S. microprocessor in his CAT scanner (a medical diagnostic device) doesn't have to run to us for a license to sell his scanner to Britain,&quot; Mr. Smart said. He said the existing restrictions had driven many foreign manufacturers to buy parts from non-U.S. sources.    For other reexport destinations, including the Soviet Union and China, licenses won't be required if the U.S. parts don't exceed 10% of a product's value or a total of $10,000 in any case. This category includes Argentina, Brazil, Egypt, India, Kuwait, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and other countries that haven't signed the nuclear nonproliferation treaty.    At the same time, the House Foreign Affairs Committee approved a package of export-control measures that includes a similar 25% threshold. As a concession to the administration, the committee lowered the threshold from the 35% recommended by its subcommittee on international trade policy. However, the 25% level approved by the committee would apply to all reexport destinations. If the measure is eventually enacted into law, it would supersede the department's regulations.    Mr. Smart said his department is also considering removing licensing requirements for the reexport of entirely U.S.made products if the second destination is either a Western European ally or Japan. He said the proposed relief could apply to all but the most sensitive U.S. products such as supercomputers. Currently, reexport licenses are required for all U.S. technical goods, regardless of the destination. </TEXT></DOC>
