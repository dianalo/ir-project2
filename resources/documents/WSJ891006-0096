The move is designed at least in part to deter Congress from enacting even tougher measures.    Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher, testifying before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said his department is &quot;carefully reviewing&quot; various types of export-applications in order to weed out ones that could make a &quot;significant contribution to a missile development program.&quot; The effort is aimed at preventing proliferation of missiles capable of carrying nuclear or chemical warheads.    Mr. Mosbacher also told the committee that the U.S. plans to tighten controls or impose new ones on 13 chemicals that could be used to make chemical weapons. He didn't identify these chemicals, but he said some of them are widely available and commonly used for making commercial products such as paint thinners, emulsifiers and fertilizers.    Separately, U.S. officials confirmed that the Bush administration is trying to dissuade the French government from allowing the transfer to Brazil of French technology for the construction of liquid-fuel rocket engines. The officials said they are concerned the technology might be transferred to an unfriendly country and used there for building ballistic missiles.    Marcilio Marques Moreira, Brazil's ambassador to Washington, said his country merely wants to gain technical experience in the construction of boosters to launch its own communications satellites. Arianespace, a government-owned French firm offering satellite-launching service, is bidding for this business, while McDonnell Douglas Corp. and American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. have submitted a competing bid, the envoy said.    A French embassy spokesman acknowledged that his government is still discussing the issue with the Bush administration. &quot;We have said that we will abide by our international obligations {to prevent proliferation of missile technology},&quot; he said. &quot;The exact nature of these obligations is the matter of discussion between our two governments.&quot;    During his testimony, Mr. Mosbacher expressed the administration's opposition to a provision in the House-passed defense authorization bill that would deny Pentagon and other federal contracts to foreign companies that violate export-control laws adopted by seven nations that signed a 1987 accord called the Missile Technology Control Regime. That pact doesn't have the force of a treaty, but it expresses the policy of each signatory to enforce strict controls on the sale of missile technology.    The Commerce Department chief said the proposed sanctions would discourage further cooperation and intelligence-sharing among the signatories.    A number of press reports have linked West German and Italian companies to missile development projects in Argentina and Egypt.    Mr. Mosbacher said the U.S. hopes three other countries will agree to join the MTCR accord. He didn't identify them, though. The original MTCR signatories are the U.S., Britain, France, West Germany, Canada, Italy and Japan.    In screening export license applications involving goods that could be used in missiles, the Commerce Department is scrutinizing the &quot;nonproliferation credentials&quot; of importing countries, the identities of actual buyers, and the applicability of the products involved to missile development, Mr. Mosbacher told the committee.    The Commerce Department's efforts concerning chemical trade will be focused on preventing potential chemical-bomb ingredients from reaching Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya, Mr. Mosbacher said. Besides trying to block direct shipments of U.S.-made chemicals to those countries, the department will seek to prevent those countries from obtaining the chemicals through third countries, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
