Nothing represents the spirit of loving, nurturing and givingmore than a homemade cookie. It is made and given from the heart. It is smalland pretty, sweet and comforting. It is something friends and family can maketogether.;   The first Christmas cookies I ever made helped create a specialbond between my Aunt Ruth and me. She invited me to sleep over and together wefigured out the ideal consistency of the dough for spritz cookies so that theywould come out of the cookie press in nice shapes. To this day, spritz cookiesare among my favorites (see recipe at left).  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Food  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CREATING GREAT COOKIES, MEMORIES  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Rose Levy Beranbaum is the author of &quot;Rose's Christmas Cookies&quot; (Morrow).  </MEMO><TEXT>     One of the nice things about baking cookies is they are very forgiving. Butif you want yours to turn out looking like the ones in the pictures, here aresome of my favorite tips:;   (check) Use the ingredients called for in therecipe. Substitutions may present problems. When a recipe calls for brownsugar, use light brown unless otherwise specified. If you substitute plaingranulated sugar, the cookies will be drier. Keep in mind that a cup of slicednuts has a much different weight than does a cup of slivered or whole nuts.;  (check) Measure or weigh carefully. If you add too much flour, the cookieswill be dry and crumbly; too little and they will spread and be thin.;  (check) Bleached all-purpose flour contains 8 to 14 grams of protein per 4ounces of flour. This is listed on the side of the bag. Lower protein flourwill result in more fragile, paler, higher cookies. Unbleached or higherprotein flour will result in tougher, browner, flatter cookies.;   (check) Forbest flavor, use unsalted butter and unsalted nuts.;   (check) Make cookies inthe same batch the same size, shape and thickness, arranged at even intervalson the baking sheet so they bake evenly.;   (check) Preheat the oven for atleast 15 minutes before baking the cookies.;   (check) Rotate the cookiesheets in the oven for even baking.;   (check) Use flat cookie sheets withvery low edges so that the air can circulate over the cookies and make themcrisp. If you only have a jelly roll pan, simply invert it and place thecookies on the back.;   (check) Use shiny, heavy-gauge aluminum cookie sheets,not darkened ones, so the cookies will brown evenly and not excessively. Thisprevents burned bottoms.;   (check) Only grease the pans if specified in therecipe. Many cookie doughs have enough butter to keep the cookies fromsticking. If the pans are greased, it will cause the cookies to spread toomuch.;   (check) Allow cookie sheets to cool completely before placing thenext batch of dough on them. The cookies will spread too much if placed on hotor warm sheets before being set by the oven's heat.;   (check) Don't overbakecookies. Remove them from the cookie sheets as soon as they are rigid enoughto transfer and cool them on racks so they remain crisp and do not continuecooking from the heat of the sheets.;   (check) Cool cookies completely beforestoring them airtight to maintain the best possible texture.;   (check) Storesoft cookies together -- not with crisp cookies -- or they will soften thecrisp ones. To preserve each cookie's special flavor, it is best to store eachvariety in its own container.;   (check) Separate layers of cookies with waxpaper to keep cookies crisp and to separate those that are sticky.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  ROSE LEVY BERANBAUM  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911204  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  598  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 4, 199100339187,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
