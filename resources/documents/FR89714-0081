The area involvedincludes all 50 States, 5 Territories and the District of Columbia. Publicmeetings will be held in the vicinity of Service headquarters in Washington,DC and, if appropriate or requested, in the 7 Service Regional Offices.Further notice will be provided in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and by separate notification on the locationand time of public meetings. This notice is being furnished as requiredby the National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFR 1501.7) toobtain suggestions and information from other agencies and the public onthe scope of issues to be addressed in the EIS.

The analysis of environmental impacts will consideractions to be carried out by the 50 States, Guam, Puerto Rico, the VirginIslands, the Northern Mariana Islands, American Samoa and the Districtof Columbia, with funding assistance by the Pittman-Robertson Federal Aidin Wildlife Restoration Act (Pub. L. 75-415 (50 Stat. 917)) or the Dingell-JohnsonFederal Aid in Sport Fish Restoration Act (Pub. L. 81-681 (64 Stat. 430)as amended (16 U.S.C. 777-777k)). The existing regulations for implementingthese Acts are found in 50 CFR Part 80. Federal funds utilized in this program are derived from excise taxes andfees which are levied on products employed in hunting, fishing, shootingand boating. The resulting revenue is allocated annually among the Statesin conformance with statutory formulae based on geographic areas and numbersof licensed hunters and fishermen and among the Territories and insularpossessions listed above based on prescribed percentage shares. A State may propose specific activities within prescribed categories (landacquisition, development, research, surveys and inventories, hunter education,boating facilities, etc.). If the Service, acting on behalf of the Secretary,finds the proposal to be substantial in character and design, the Statemay proceed with accomplishing the activity, using non-Federal funds. TheState may then claim reimbursement of up to 75 percent of these outlays_territoriesand insular possessions may claim up to 100 percent_from the grant allocation.The States use of funds from these two assistance programs during fiscalyears 1985, 1986 and 1987 are summarized as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,tp0,i1,s100,10,8,10,8 </C>  <H1>Activity </H1><H1>Funds ($1000) and percent of total expended </H1><H2>Pittman-Robertson </H2><H2>Percent </H2><H2>Dingell-Johnson </H2><H2>Percent </H2> <ITAG tagnum="1">Hunter education <D>$23,242 </D><D>9 </D><D> </D><D>  </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Land acquisition <D>15,891 </D><D>6 </D><D>3,463 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Development <D>30,185 </D><D>11 </D><D>31,055 </D><D>20 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Surveys and inventories <D>45,940 </D><D>17 </D><D>50,899 </D><D>36 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Research <D>28,230 </D><D>11 </D><D>82,139 </D><D>24 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Technical guidance <D>9,773 </D><D>4 </D><D>6,725 </D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Operation and maintenance <D>87,240 </D><D>33 </D><D>10,508 </D><D>5 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Planning <D>3,221 </D><D>1 </D><D>2,544 </D><D>2 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Administration <D>22,698 </D><D>8 </D><D>9,524 </D><D>6</D></ITAG></ITAG> It is not possible to specify with certainty the actions that will characterizethis program in years ahead since the States are the primary determinantsin the selection of these actions. For this Environmental Impact Statement,anticipated activities will be based on the expectations of a panel ofState officials and on records from recent years but with modificationsto accommodate any known trends and legislative redirections. The environmental impacts produced by these programs are believed to beprimarily beneficial. Such impacts include the maintenance of lands ina more or less natural state, the restoration and maintenance of fish andwildlife species and providing for a sustained program of public recreationand education. However, the execution of these programs may result in otherimpacts, such as altering certain habitats and animal populations, floodingor burning certain vegetation areas and affecting changes in local economicactivity by altering the status or availability of fish and wildlife. Many of the fish and wildlife species given management attention underthis program are subjected to harvest by hunters, fishermen and trappers.Such harvests, if properly conceived and carried out, are considered legitimateand biologically defensible parts of fish and wildlife management. However,this activity is a State responsibility performed upon action by the State'spolicy-making body. Hence, hunting and fishing are not program activitiesand will not be addressed in this Environmental Impact Statement. Since their inception in 1937 and 1950, the Wildlife Restoration and SportFish Restoration Acts, respectively, have been primary forces in the recoveryof numerous wildlife and fish species. During early years, managers focusedalmost exclusively on species of interest to hunters and fishermen. Whilethis was consistent with the sources of funds and the demands of the publicinitially, this focus has broadened somewhat. The States currently direct all of their Dingell-Johnson funds (as requiredby the Dingell-Johnson Act) and roughly 80 percent of their Pittman-Robertsonfunds to harvested species. There may be a need for even greater attentionto: (1) The management of non-harvested species, (2) the education of thepublic regarding natural systems, and (3) the facilitation of a broad-spectrumprogram of related public recreation with greater attention to the needsof urban and suburban areas. This Environmental Impact Statement will consideralternatives formulated to evaluate the environmental consequences of pursuingsuch emphases. Under the present laws, changes deemed necessary would probablybe accomplished through a more stringent interpretation of ``substantialityin character and design'' or by revision of the Secretary's Rules and Regulations.The following draft alternatives will be examined for possible refinementor revision during the scoping process. <T3>Alternative andplusmin;1 </T3>Federal requirements would mandate thatat least 50 percent of each year's Pittman-Robertson funds expended bythe State would be on waterfowl habitat or in pursuit of the North AmericanWaterfowl Management Plan and at least 50 percent of each year's Dingell-Johnsonfunds expended by the State would be on the protection, maintenance andimprovement of aquatic habitats, including water quality. <T3>Alternative andplusmin;2 </T3>At least 50 percent of each year's Pittman-Robertsonfunds would be expended on restoring and enhancing terrestrial ecosystemswithout reference to hunted/non-hunted status. At least 50 percent of eachyear's Dingell-Johnson funds would be expended on restoring and enhancingaquatic ecosystems without reference to sport fisheries. <T3>Alternative andplusmin;3 </T3>All projects funded would be required tobe free of practices considered offensive to significant portions of thepublic (e.g., marsh burning, the use of fish toxicants, the use of herbicidesor insecticides, research resulting in death or stress on animals, etc.).<T3>Alternative andplusmin;4 </T3>By 1995, all States would be required tohave in place a comprehensive plan or other systematic process for settingwork priorities consistent with human needs and the status of the resourcebase. Thereafter, all requirements and prohibitions on activities wouldbe repealed and the Federal role would be limited to allocating funds and,monitoring compliance with Federal statutes. Through the scoping process, the Service will seek public input on thefollowing: 1. New or revised alternatives to be considered. 2. Impacts to be evaluated for each of the alternatives considered. 3. Comments (favorable or unfavorable) on the Pittman-Robertson or Dingell-Johnsonprogram in its present configuration. 4. Comments on the adequacy or inadequacy of present funding levels. 5. If funding levels are inadequate, proposals for source(s) of additionalfunds. The public is encouraged to participate in this process by providing theirviews on the administration and management of this program and by providingoptions or alternatives to be considered and evaluated in the programmaticEnvironmental Impact Statement. The environmental review of this program will be conducted in accordancewith the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,as amended (42 U.S.C. 4331, <T3>et seq.</T3>), National Environmental Policy Act regulations (40 CFRParts 1500-1508), other appropriate Federal laws and regulations, and Serviceprocedures for compliance with those regulations. We estimate the Draft Environmental Impact Statement will be made availableto the public by October 31, 1990. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: July 5, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard N.
