The recombinant bacteriophagesPhi 105Rec Phi1 (3.85-kilobase insert) and Phi 105Rec Phi4 (3.3-kilobaseinsert) both conferred on the recE4 strain YB1015 resistance to ethylmethanesulfonate, methylmethane sulfonate, mitomycin C, and UV irradiation comparablewith the resistance observed in recE{sup +} strains. While strain YB1015(recE4) and its derivatives lysogenized with bacteriophage Phi105J23were not transformed to prototrophy by B. subtilis chromosomal DNA, strainYB1015 lysogenized with either Phi 105Rec Phi 1 or Phi 105RecPhi 4 wassusceptible to transformation with homologous B. subtilis chromosomalDNA. The heteroimmune prophages Phi 105 and SPO2 were essentially uninduciblein strain YB1015. Significantly, both recombinant prophages Phi 105RecPhi1 and Phi 105Rec Phi 4 were fully inducible and allowed the spontaneousand mitomycin C-dependent induction of a coresident SPO2 prophage ina recE4 host. The presence of the recombinant prophages also restoredthe ability of din genes to be induced in strains carrying the recE4mutation. Finally, both recombinant bacteriophages elaborated a mitomycinC-inducible, 45-kilodalton protein that was immunoreactive with Escherichiacoli recA{sup +} gene product antibodies. Collectively, these data demonstratethat the recE{sup +} gene has been cloned and that this gene elaboratesthe 45-kilodalton protein that is involved in SOB induction and homologousrecombination.</TEXT></DOC>
