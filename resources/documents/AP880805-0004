George Bushinvoked the names of Kennedy and Truman to show Dukakis has veered``far outside the mainstream'' on foreign policy.   As Bush tried to portray the Democratic presidential nominee asoccupying the liberal extreme, his own Republican party's rightwing was telling the vice president to avoid ``establishment bluebloods'' when choosing a running mate.   The warning from the Coalition for a Winning Ticket came as Gov.George Deukmejian of California took himself out of consideration.   In another campaign matter, Bush chief of staff Craig Fullerconfirmed Thursday that Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III wouldleave his post and become campaign chief before the Aug. 15 startof the Republican convention in New Orleans. Sources said theannouncement could come today.   ``We don't have to make the false choice, the fool's choice,between economic growth or environmental quality,'' Dukakis toldstudents at the University of California at Los Angeles, ``We canhave both, and in fact we must have both.''   Dukakis' West Coast foray followed a trip into Mississippi, atraditionally Democratic state that helped send President Reaganand Richard Nixon to the White House. Dukakis lost the state toJesse Jackson in this year's Democratic primary.   Dukakis spoke at the Neshoba County fair near where the bodiesof three slain civil rights workers were found 24 years agoThursday. Reagan campaigned at the fair in 1980 for his first term.   Dukakis failed to mention the killings when addressing thealmost entirely white crowd, and referred only once to civilrights. ``I talked about economic opportunity because that's themost important single thing that concerns people,'' he explained.   Bush, speaking to a Hispanic veterans group in Corpus Christi,Texas, criticized Dukakis for his support for a nuclear freeze andopposition to a new MX missile, the Midgetman missile and theReagan administration's proposed Star Wars nuclear defense system.   ``His positions ... amount to a rejection of America's role as aworld leader and a repudiation of the Truman doctrine and thevision of John Kennedy,'' Bush said, referring to bipartisanforeign policy that evolved after World War II and focused oncontaining communism.   Dukakis, when asked whether he still supports a nuclear freeze,said, ``Sure, and a comprehensive test ban treaty.''   Later aboard his plane, Dukakis said he originally supported afreeze ``because we wanted to stop the administration fromexpanding the arsenal.''   ``Now, it's turned around and we're talking about reduction. I'mfor reductions now,'' he said. ``I favor the development of certainarms systems. I favor deep cuts in strategic weapons systems.''   Bush also stabbed at the Democratic platform, calling it ``theblack hole of American politics.''   ``Issues get sucked into it and lost, never to reappear again,''he said.   Bush later detoured to Chicago for the wake of a Polish-Americanleader. It was his third such appearance this week in an ethnicsetting as the certain Republican nominee tries to keep Dukakis,the multilingual son of immigrants, from winning that segment ofthe population.   Deukmejian said he took himself out of consideration becauseDemocrats would gain control of the Statehouse in California if hedropped out. The Bush campaign said it accepted his decision.   Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who heads the conservativecoalition urging Bush to choose someone from the right, saidThursday:   ``The problem of the Bush campaign is that it is attracted toestablishment blue-bloods. What the Bush ticket needs is atransfusion of red corpuscles from the conservative wing of ourparty.''   He said Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana, Rep. Jack Kemp of New Yorkand Gov. John Sununu of New Hampshire would be acceptable.   A recent analysis by The Gallup Organization seems to give theDemocratic ticket hope in formerly pro-Reagan Western states.   The analysis said Western voters are optimistic about their ownfinancial future but dissatisfied with the general course of thenation, and they don't find in Bush the anti-establishment leaderthey found in Reagan.   For example, ``traditionally anti-government voters in the RockyMountains are now calling for more government action on socialissues than is the average American voter,'' wrote Andrew Kohut,head of the Gallup organization.   Kohut said the regional analyses he released were developed from8,500 detailed interviews taken between May and July. The margin oferror is just under 2 percentage points. The analysis was done forthe Times-Mirror Co.</TEXT></DOC>
