LIM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Riot police and radical studentsbattled with tear gas, steel bars and rocks Thursday as studentsdemanded the government lift a ban barring them from a youthfestival in North Korea.   President Roh Tae-woo said leftists threaten democracy in SouthKorea, and Unification Minister Lee Hong-koo said the government maypostpone planned talks with Pyongyang's communist government.   About 1,500 students fought riot troopers around Seoul's HanyangUniversity after 3,000 police sealed off the campus to stop othercollege students joining the protest.   Waves of students poured over the school walls, throwing rocksand firebombs. Small groups wielding metal pipes charged throughbroken walls and attacked police.   Riot police fought back, firing volleys of tear gas from armoredvans and rifles and hurling tear gas grenades and rocks across thewalls and locked gates.   A dozen students were seen injured. One policeman was injuredseriously when tear gas shells exploded inside an armored van.   In downtown Seoul, about 700 students wanting to get into Hanyangcampus occupied a major intersection. They fought riot police withfirebombs and rocks, forcing shoppers to race for shelter.   ``Drive out Yankees who block national unification!'' theprotesters screamed. ``Overthrow Roh Tae-woo!''   Radicals back North Korea's calls for the Seoul government toexpel 43,000 U.S. troops whose presence they say hinders dialogue onunification. Roh says the troops deter the north from invading again.   ``Let's march to Pyongyang!'' the students shouted, demanding thegovernment allow them to attend a July 1-8 youth festival in NorthKorea.   Seoul says Pyongyang is using the festival to stir up radicalmovements. North Korea denies the charges about the sports andcultural event that is attended mainly by non-aligned and communistnations.   Meanwhile, Roh pledged today he will maintain a ``strong''government against illegal acts and leftists who he claimed threatendemocracy.   Roh said individual contacts with North Korea undermine hisgovernment's efforts to advance national unification.   He was referring to Wednesday's surprise arrest of oppositionlegislator Suh Kyung-won for a secret trip to North Korea and talkswith its leader, Kim Il Sung.   Suh's arrest stunned South Koreans and prosecutors moved quicklyto broaden their investigations. The lawmaker visited Pyongyang inAugust after contacting North Korean agents in West Germany.   Security officials said Suh, already charged with violating theNational Security Law forbidding contacts with ``anti-state''bodies, also could be accused of espionage if it is found he workedwith North Korean agents.</TEXT></DOC>
