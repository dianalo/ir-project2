Paynai Sirirat, a senior Thai border official, said Peter L. Pondof Providence, R.I., was shot in the leg by a Cambodian from theSite 8 camp, located on the Thai-Cambodian frontier. The officialcould not confirm whether the guman was a Khmer Rouge soldier.   Pond was taken to a Bangkok hospital where a nurse said he was inthe emergency room for X-rays. She declined to give more details,saying the U.S. Embassy had asked the hospital not to talk withreporters about the case.   Sirirat said Pond and the gunman quarreled before the shooting.He said the argument might have been over Pond's work at the camp.   Pond is a Protestant minister who has worked with Cambodianrefugees and adopted several Cambodian children.   He helped Cambodian Buddhist monks build a temple at the refugeecamp and planned to set up a Buddhist school.   Jim Anderson of the International Rescue Committee, which alsoworks with Cambodian refugees, said he had heard Pond was shot by aKhmer Rouge soldier in the leg while just south of the camp.Anderson said his information was sketchy and ``not firsthand.''   Site 8 is south of the Thai border town of Aranyaprathet andhouses nearly 40,000 refugees. They are followers of the KhmerRouge, one of three guerrilla groups fighting the Vietnamese and thePhnom Penh government in Cambodia.   Pond has been closely associated with a charismatic CambodianBuddhist monk, Maha Ghosananda, who has sought to unite the warringparties in Cambodia.   Ghosananda heads The Cambodian Mission for Peace, which Pondhelped found and organize. Both men attended recent peace talks toend the civil war in Cambodia and urged all factions to reconciletheir differences.   The ultra-leftist Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia in the 1970s andkilled hundreds of thousands of people in a drive to return to aprimitive agrarian society. Vietnam invaded Cambodia in 1979 andousted the Khmer Rouge.   The guerrillas claim they have renounced their radical ways, butWestern aid organizations, human rights groups and others say theiris mounting proof the Khmer Rouge remains a ruthless force.</TEXT></DOC>
