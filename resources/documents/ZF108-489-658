 Althoughstill running behind the Ethernet standard, this LAN topology driven by IBMis catching up, thanks to its inherent ability to efficiently move more datafrom more users in ever-larger file sizes across busy networks humming withtraffic.andP;  Helping to set this heavier traffic pattern are the proliferationof PCs and larger, more complex internetworks--trends that promise to shifttoken ring technology into the fast LAN lane.andM;Today, the Big Blue blessed Token Ring is more of a must-have for IBM shopsthan it is for mixed-vendor environments that have tailored their nets aroundthe more independent Ethernet standard.andP;  With a market lead that stretchessome three to four years, Ethernet is particularly strong among large LANinstallations and at sites where minicomputers and mainframes are linked tothe network.andM;This current Ethernet stronghold was confirmed by a study done last year byindustry researcher Computer Intelligence in La Jolla, Calif.andP;  About 91% ofsites with general purpose LANs reported using Ethernet.andP;  In PCinstallations, though, Computer Intelligence found that the two LANapproaches have comparable market shares.andP;  Asked about the future, 41% of thesites surveyed said they planned to install Token Ring, versus 51% forEthernet.andP;  Among PC LANs, an astonishing 54% of the sites expected to go withToken Ring; only 35% saw Ethernet in their future.andM;Further evidence that Token Ring is gaining ground from Ethernet can be seenfrom the shipment statistics compiled by San Jose-based Dataquest Inc.andP;  In1988, 34% of LAN shipments carried a Token Ring label, while 40% carried theEthernet stamp.andP;  However, Dataquest predicts that, by 1992, Ethernet LANshipments will fall to 35% and Token Ring shipments will soar to 48% to leadthe market.andM;Today, users often opt for a mixture of the two LAN topologies.andP;  That's theselection scenario at New York City publishing house MacMillan Inc.andP;  Sayscommunications manager Lucille Kuttler, &quot;The departments chose what theywanted.andP;  I don't dictate what goes in.andP;  We have both Ethernet and Token Ringin the building.&quot;andP;  Nevertheless, data that travels between floors must behooked into the company's ATandamp;T System 85 PBX, a linkup that Kuttler closelycontrols.andM;When the central IS organization is footing the bill, then the LANscapefrequently bears the token mark.andP;  CBS Inc., the New York City-based radio andTV broadcaster, is a Big Blue bastion where Token Ring reigns supreme.andP;  Eventhough firmly entrenched in the IBM camp, the broadcaster still &quot;waited alittle while to get into local area networking,&quot; explains CBS datacommunications manager Gerry Plaine.andP;  &quot;But we're happy with what we got [IBMLAN hardware and software].&quot;andM;But even though IBM shops may naturally favor the IBM LAN, they do notautomatically exclude rival Ethernet.andP;  Philip Morris Inc. is a good case inpoint.andP;  Despite the fact that the New York City conglomerate is a Big Blueloyalist, it also has some Ethernet products.andM;&quot;Ethernet and Token Ring are both substantial products, and I like both ofthem,&quot; says Greg Lyman, manager of end-user computing at Philip Morris.andP;  Whenit comes to tying into the enterprisewide network, however, the companycounts on Token Ring.andP;  &quot;We look at LANs as just an extension of the worldwidePhilip Morris network,&quot; he says.andM;Since Philip Morris' worldwide enterprise network is supported by IBMdata-processing and data communications systems, the company's choice ofToken Ring as the right technology for its PC LANs that require wide arealinks is hardly surprising.andP;  It's also not surprising considering TokenRing's growing influence in the PC LAN arena and in internet-workingarrangements such as enterprise networking.andM;A Tricky ComparisonandM;A look at the differences between the two topologies sheds light on why someusers are linking their LANs with Token Rings.andM;The primary areas of difference between Ethernet and Token Ring are speed,access methods, wiring schemes and operating systems.andP;  Network speed is anobvious but perhaps misleading difference between the two local area networktypes.andP;  The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.'s 802.3specification for Ethernet uses 10 megabits per second; the IEEE 802.5standard for Token Ring lists 4Mbps.andM;Direct speed comparisons are tricky because these speeds only refer to themaximum rate at which a single block of data crosses the system.andP;  It does notmean that all or any individual station can transmit or receive data at thatspeed.andP;  A true measure of data throughput, then, takes into account thenetwork operating system software and the number of users on the system.andO;This latter point is particularly important, since the actual throughput willusually be less than the maximum unless the network is constantly active.andM;Speed issues are also implicit in the access methods used by the twoapproaches.andP;  Under Ethernet, any station can attempt to gain network accessat any time.andP;  But if two or more nodes try for access at the same time, acollision occurs, and all stations cease transmission.andP;  After a short periodof time, one station can reattempt the transmission.andP;  If another collisionoccurs, the stations must once again back off and wait a little longer beforestarting over.andM;A token passing network has none of these collision problems.andP;  The token isin fact a series of bits that grants a station permission to transmit, butonly for a defined interval.andP;  At the end of that interval, the token passesto the next station.andP;  Stations must simply wait their turn.andM;The token can be passed in any number of ways.andP;  Some stations on the LAN canbe given higher priority than others, which can mean that they have morenetwork access time than others.andP;  But no station can get more time than it isallotted.andP;  Control is therefore centralized in the token-passing schemerather than being random, as with Ethernet.andM;So although Ethernet is faster, the speed at which any one station can movedata is not certain.andP;  The amount of time spent backing off from collisionscould severely decrease the time available for data transmission.andP;  Althoughthe network will seldom grind to a halt, the fact remains that throughputwill decrease as use increases.andP;  So even if all goes smoothly, the networkwill rarely run over 50% capacity, or at 5Mbps.andM;In contrast, the token scheme allows a network that has a great deal oftraffic to run at or near capacity most of the time.andP;  Ethernet's speedadvantage gradually decreases as traffic increases.andP;  Some observers claimthat Ethernet teamed with efficient networking software can run at 70% ofcapacity, or 7Mbps.andP;  This may be a moot point, since even the fastest PCscan't read or write data to a disk at speeds greater than 1Mbps.andP;  Furthermoreit's unlikely that data will be pumped into or out of a PC at speeds evenapproaching the maximum burst rate of either LAN type.andP;  In most cases, thebottlenecks are built into the LAN servers or the clients, not into thenetwork in between.andM;Last year, IBM began shipping products that upped the data rate of the TokenRing to 16Mbps.andP;  Although the Token Ring may never challenge IBM's SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA) for host-based applications, it could, thanks toits higher data rates, prove quite useful in backbone applications.andM;The network management and fault tolerance features inherent in the TokenRing's centralized control approach also give the local area networksignificant advantages, especially when it's used as part of enterprisewidenetworks.andP;  To further enhance these control features, IBM has added a specialwiring scheme to its Token Ring LAN.andM;The inclusion of network management in IBM's Token Ring prepares it for thefuture when larger and more complex internetwork relationships are expectedto blossom throughout companies.andP;  The sheer number of LAN users is alsoexpected to increase over time.andP;  Those future users will have more data tosend, and the files they'll be sending will also be longer.andP;  Thoserequirements mean that Ethernet, given the limitations previously discussed,will not be as effective as Token Ring.andP;  For example, if several users needto move large amounts of data at the same time, the Token Ring is a betterway to ration network time.andM;The Paper Performance TigerandM;The debate over which LAN type affords the best performance with whichnetwork operating system also appears to be a paper tiger.andP;  And written onthat paper are conflicting benchmark test results.andP;  In benchmarks using thepopular operating system NetWare from Novell Inc., the Token Ring was pittedagainst Ethernet.andP;  The result was lopsided victories for Ethernet--victoriesthat IBM blames on Novell's driver software and that Novell blames on IBM'sLAN adapter hardware.andM;In benchmarks involving hardware and software from Santa Clara-based 3ComCorp., the performance differences between Token Ring and Ethernet systemsare minor.andP;  Both are fast.andP;  And Token Rings from 3Com were reported to haveeven beaten IBM's token in terms of both price and performance.andM;Much more complex than these simple price/performance comparisons is theissue of connections between Ethernet and Token Ring.andP;  Among the keyquestions here are: Which LAN topology best supports the needs of a backbone?andO;and Which best supports the integration of large host computers into thenetwork?andM;Ethernet may in fact not be the best choice, particularly when mainframes andvery large files are involved.andP;  And there is little doubt that file size isdestined to mushroom.andP;  Already, the integration of bit-mapped graphics andfax could increase the size of a typical file 1,000-fold.andP;  Likewise, the useof optical fiber could boost LAN bandwidth into the gigabit range.andP;  Some saythis vision of desktop computing in the future was one of the major reasonsIBM went with the token concept in the first place.andM;IBM has been singing the concept's praises since March 1982, when itpresented a series of papers on the token-passing topic to the IEEE's 802committee.andP;  In fact, until 17 months ago, the company was by far the loudestvoice in the token ring chorus.andP;  A majority of the Token Ring productsshipped carried the familiar blue pin-striped logo, and all significantenhancements were likewise developed and announced by IBM.andP;  In addition, thetoken titan also dominated standards activities.andM;In order to provide a counterbalance to IBM, several prominent token ringvendors banded together at the end of 1988 to form the Open Token Foundation(OTF).andP;  The nonprofit group is dedicated to expanding token ringinteroperability, encouraging compatible designs, facilitating communicationbetween vendors and increasing end user awareness of IBM-compatible tokenring products.andM;IBM and Token ControlandM;The OTF has been moderately successful in meeting those goals.andP;  Membershipcontinues to grow, but the key player in the industry, IBM, turned down anoffer to join.andP;  Some observers say that IBM nixed OTF because it doesn't wantto surrender control of its strategic LAN platform to an industry consortium.andO;As it is now, the company wields considerable control over tokendevelopments, primarily because the IEEE 802.2 and 802.5 standards do notdefine a complete token ring system.andP;  This loophole enables IBM to make asmany design choices in its chips and interfaces as the IEEE leaves open asoptions.andM;Leaving those design choices up to Big Blue worries the OTF, which was formedto minimize the possibility of divergence between the IBM and IEEE token ringstandards.andP;  Such divergence could come as enhancements are added.andP;  As thingsstand now, plug-compatible vendors would almost have to follow the IBMstandard to keep their markets.andP;  And those who opted to stick to the IEEEspecs would risk becoming incompatible with almost two-thirds of the tokenrings installed.andM;IBM already created a compatibility mini-crisis when it designed two newsoftware packages to communicate several crucial start-up commands directlyto its on-board Token Ring chip set.andP;  And still another problem emerged whenit was discovered that some board makers were using sections of chip memorythat IBM had reserved for future enhancements.andP;  When those enhancementsarrived, the aberrant boards turned out to be somewhat incompatible with theIBM system.andP;  Such interoperability glitches are usually promptly corrected bythe vendor--but only after the fact and after the end user is reminded thatIBM compatibility is not guaranteed by anybody but IBM.andM;IBM is also beginning to show an unwillingness to wait for the IEEE or otherstandards bodies to approve changes to the token ring standard.andP;  The timingof the 16Mbps announcement illustrates this.andP;  IBM made its 16Mbpsannouncement only days after the IEEE 802.5 subcommittee added the higherspeed to its standard.andP;  In fact, 16Mbps was not even an official IEEEstandard at the time IBM announced the upgrade.andM;IBM is also frequently chastised for not sharing crucial information ondesign changes with vendors.andP;  Its dealings with Texas Instruments Inc., whichhelped it develop the original 4Mbps Token Ring chip set, provides a goodcase in point.andP;  Although TI's TMS380 LAN Adapter chip set is analogous to theIBM set, any of several small differences can lead to incompatibilities lateron.andP;  IBM also made its 16Mbps move before TI was ready to roll with acompatible chip set for third parties.andM;The lack of a complete TI chip set, however, has not stopped some vendorssuch as Proteon Inc. of Westborough, Mass., and Ungermann-Bass Inc. of SantaClara, from entering the 16Mbps race.andP;  Nevertheless, it may be a race thatIBM began to run too early.andP;  Even after 18 months, the case for 16Mbps is farfrom compelling.andP;  Despite IBM vows that it's struggling to keep up withdemand for 16Mbps boards, the market is still utlterly dominated by 4Mbpsproducts.andM;So the case for 16Mbps may have to wait until users fill up their networkswith large amounts of host data or perhaps fax and imaging files.andP;  It mayalso have to wait until the token leader can devise a system that matchesProteon's 16Mbps system that runs over simple telephone wire.andM;Eric Arnum is a data communications specialist based in Forest Hills, N.Y.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
