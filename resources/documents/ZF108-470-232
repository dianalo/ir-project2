None of these options arecompatible with previous PS/2 8525 models.andP;  The system can be increased to4Mb on the planar and can address up to a maximum of 16Mb.andP;  IBM says that thePS/2 Model 25 286 is a low-cost, high performance workstation for astand-alone or network environment, and claims that the 10MHz 80286microprocessor, 80287 Maths Co-Processor, 16Mb maximum addressability, 30Mbdisk, and the compatibility of a wide range of features and software make itattractive to its targeted educational market.andP;  The 4Mb memory on the systemboard enables the user to run most MS-DOS applications and toincrease systemperformance through the disk cache program included on the PS/2 Model 25 286Starter Diskette.andP;  The new machine is supported by OS/2 Extended Edition 1.1or 1.2, OS/2 Standard 1.1 or 1.2, or MS-DOS Version 3.3 or 4.0.andP;  It iscompatible with the IBM personal computer, or the XT and AT at the BIOSinterface level, and at most hardware interfaces.andP;  The ability to use anon-IBM memory expansion card is dependent on how flexible the card is inestablishing its starting memory address, and memory expansion cards mustsupport the listed starting address to properly operate in a system with agiven amount of planar memory.andP;  Costs start at $2,295 for Model 006, andModels G06, 036, and G36 are $2,340, $3,000, and $3,040 respectively.andP;  The1.44Mb 1&quot; disk drive is $263, the 20Mb fixed disk drive costs $787, $824 forthe 30Mb version - the fixed disk drive Kit A is $65.andP;  As from May 10 1990,IBM is announcing prices for the PS/2 Model 25 286 when ordered by primaryschools and secondary schools that qualify for the Educational Allowance.andO;These product configurations are currently not available to faculty, staff orpost-secondary students purchasing through the IBM Education Order Centre,but will be included at these prices when the products become available forimmediate shipment.andP;  Details on this programme await a future announcement.andO;The PS/2 Model 25 286 006 with one disk drive, keyboard and MS-DOS 3.3 is$1,377, Model G06 is $1,404, and Model 036 with a 30Mb hard disk costs$1,797.andP;  The G36 with a 30Mb fixed disk and DOS 3.3 is $1,824, and the 006with one disk drive and MS-DOS 4.0 is $1,392.andP;  The G06 with one disk driveand MS-DOS 4.0 is $1,419, and the 036 with a 30Mb disk and MS-DOS 4.0 is$1,812.andP;  The G36 with 30Mb disk and MS-DOS 4.0 is $1,839.andM;Merva/370 v.2 is delayed to year end asandM;IBM waits for SWIFT resultsandM;IBM says it has postponed announcing availability of Merva/370 Version 2 -Message Entry and Routing to Various Applications - originally scheduled forApril (CI No 1,358), in order to incorporate the results of the Society forWorldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication's live operations startup.andO;Announcement of availability is now scheduled for the fourth quarter, 1990.andO;MERVA/370 Version 2 supports the SWIFT II functions but the Series/1 TelexInterface Program is not available in the US.andP;  TXIP Series/1 was included inthe MERVA/370 Version 2 announcement for consistency with announcements inother countries.andP;  The following features are available to all users ofMERVA/370 Version 2 via the PS/2 component - telex creation; formattedmessage support; telex receiving; test key calculation interface; test keyverification interface; and correspondent address file maintenance.andP;  For MVS,either CICS/MVS v.2 Release 1 or CICS/ESA v.3 Release 1 is required.andM;IBM has Battelle Memorial Institute's programmers ToolChestandM;ToolChest is published and licensed by Battelle Memorial Institute, andmarketed by IBM under its Co-operative Software Program.andP;  ToolChest is acomputer integrated manufacturing system created for manufacturing, designand numerical control part programming.andP;  It is claimed to meet specialmanufacturing needs such as designing and machining contoured parts, moulds,patterns and tooling, as well as Coordinate Measuring Machine inspection pathprogramming.andP;  IBM says that by using computer graphics, there is no need tolearn complex programming languages, as menus lead the operator directly tothe desired system function.andP;  The software runs on PS/2 models 70 and 80under AIX.andP;  Toolchest has one associative database for all computer-aideddesign, computer-aided engineering, and computer-aided manufacturingfunctions.andP;  It includes surfacing tools and maths flexibility to modelcomplex surfaces and accepts part data from other computer aided designsystems.andP;  It supports ball, flat-end and bull-nose tools for up to five-axismilling and swarf cutting, and has software for cutter location pathcalculations.andP;  The software also includes an intelligent post-processor, andmeets several international and American standards.andP;  The software runs onPS/2 machines and the various tools cost between $6,000 and and $12,000.andP;  Astarter package with subsets of design tool, machining tool, data tool, andlink tool, costs $18,000.andP;  The advanced package also has a picture tool andcosts $33,000, a total package is $50,000.andM;Program products added to VSE/SP v.3.2andM;CICS VSAM Recovery and VSE Software Inventory Control have been added to thelist of optional program products to VSE/SP Version 3 Release 2.andP;  Decisionand Information Support Productivity Facility and Cross System Product/Queryare no longer orderable as optional products to VSE/SP Version 3 Release 2.andO;Optional program products Personal Services/CICS, DisplayWrite/370, CrossSystem Product/Application Development, Cross System Product/ApplicationExecution, Structured Query Language/Data System, and DL/I DOS/VS have allbeen updated to new releases or modification levels.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
