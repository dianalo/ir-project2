Robertson ended January with $5.5 million in the bank, but hiscampaign had $6 million in debts as he far outspent any othercandidate on the Super Tuesday contests involving 20 states onMarch 8.   Rival GOP contenders George Bush and Bob Dole, on the otherhand, remained in good shape.   Bush, the overall fund-raising leader, ended January with $9.2million in cash on hand and $811,029 in obligations, while Dole had$4.2 million and $654,269 in bills to pay, their latest financialstatements show.   Neither had any loans outstanding, but the other GOP contender,Rep. Jack Kemp of New York, took out $750,000 in loans to getthrough the Iowa and New Hampshire contests this month.   Among Democratic candidates, money leader Michael Dukakis hadthe most cash available, $4 million.   Besides his loan, Robertson reported contributions of $1.3million during January. His report also listed as receipts the $6.5million in federal matching funds that he applied for but had saidhe might not use.   Robertson had said he was philosophically opposed to the publicfinancing system and his staff said he would only use matchingfunds if he needed to stay competitive.   Robertson's campaign did not return calls Monday night to answerquestions about the loan, by far the biggest borrowing of anycampaign for the 1988 election.   Robertson paid off a short-term loan of $1.5 million that hisattorney has said was secured with his matching funds, hisreportshowed.   The latest financial reports were due at the Federal ElectionCommission on Saturday, but Robertson's was not filed until lateMonday.   It showed that the new loan was taken out in January from SovranBank in Chesapeake, Va., at an interest rate of prime plus 1percent and was due to be repaid on Feb. 28.   The sizable expenditures on this month's Iowa and New Hampshirecontests and subsequent spending toward Super Tuesday are notreflected in the new reports, which cover the period through Jan.31.   Robertson has spent more than any other candidate against theoverall spending ceiling which is set by election law at $27million for the primary season. He reported spending $17.6 millionagainst the cap.   Bush, conversely, while raising more money than any othercandidate, has been watching his budget and has spent the least ofany Republican contender against the cap.   He reported spending $10.7 million against the ceiling, comparedwith Kemp's $12.8 million and Dole's $13.5 million.   Robertson also spent the most of any campaign in a single state_ $1 million in Texas, compared with Bush's $335,743 and Dole's$81,645.   Wealthy campaigns must keep from spending too much early in thecampaign, because they could leave themselves unable to spend moneyon later contests without going over the limit.   On the Democratic side, none of the candidates approached thecap, with Dukakis spending the most at $7.8 million.   The Massachusetts governor also had the biggest Democratic bankaccount at the beginning of this month, $4 million with $511,789 inbills to pay, while the next nearest Democrat, Sen. Al Gore Jr. ofTennessee, had $2 million with $84,248 in obligations.   Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., borrowed $523,674 in January and endedthe month with a $691,069 debt and only $401,176 in the bank. Heraised $534,259 in contributions for the month, $1.9 million inmatching funds, and $523,674 in loans.   Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., entered February with $820,260 indebts and $172,477 in cash on hand. He collected $212,702 incontributions and $1.9 million in matching funds during January.   Aides for both Gephardt and Simon have said that fund-raisingpicked up this month and that they have whittled down their debts.   Gore had ignored Iowa to concentrate on the Super Tuesdaystates, but he raised very little money during the time the othercandidates were campaigning hard in Iowa and New Hampshire.   He collected only $180,746 in contributions during January, inaddition to the $1.8 million in matching funds he got, his reportshowed.   Dukakis raised $804,839 in contributions and got $3.5 millionmatching funds.   Democratic contender Jesse Jackson reported raising $610,036 indonations, plus $598,021 in matching funds during January, endingthe month with $509,978 in cash on hand and $354,881 in obligations.   Former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart ended the month with $615,547 incash on hand and $24,484 in debts after collecting $70,303 incontributions and $937,325 in matching funds.   Kemp continued a hand-to-mouth campaign, ending January with adebt of $1.3 million after raising $1 million for the month.However, his political director, Charlie Black, said the debt wouldbe wiped out when Kemp's federal mathching funds come in this month.   He insisted the campaign is not in financial trouble, saying aheavy mail solicitation program and fund-raising events are reapingabout $400,000 a week.   Dole raised $1.2 million in contributions for January and got$5.6 in matching funds, while Bush collected $767,892 privately andgot $6.4 million in matching funds.   Most candidates got very large matching fund payments in Januarybecause that was the first months the money was released, and thesums were based on the candidates' fund raising for all precedingmonths.   Candidates can get matching funds from the federal Treasury foreach contribution of $250 or less that they raise in private funds.The matching fund is supported by the $1 checkoff on individualincome tax returns.</TEXT></DOC>
