As investors bailing out of the stock market moved into bonds and mortgage-backed securities, they drove up prices of those investments. That pushed down interest rates, which move in the opposite direction. Average rates of fixed-rate mortgages fell from more than 12% to less than 11%.    But at the same time -- for reasons unrelated to the stock-market crash -- adjustable-rate lenders were moving to narrow an unusually wide gap that had developed between fixed and adjustable rates. These lenders say they were reacting to the rise in interest rates that had occurred in the months prior to the market's collapse.    &quot;The gap between adjustable rates and fixed rates has widened significantly over the last year, and it's time for the adjustables to move up a bit,&quot; says Ian Campbell, a senior vice president of Great Western Bank, a major adjustable-rate lender in California, Florida and other states.    Before last week, &quot;you had close to a five-percentage-point gap between fixed-rate loans and starting rates for adjustable-rate loans,&quot; says Sigmund Anderman, chief executive of Compufund National Mortgage Network, a Pleasanton, Calif.-based loan-shopping service. &quot;Adjustable-rate lenders started increasing their rates to reflect that. The teaser rates are a teaser for the consumer -- and a big expense for the lender. And if there's not a big reason for it, I think they won't underwrite that spread.&quot;    With last week's changes, initial rates on adjustable mortgages are still three or more percentage points lower than rates on fixed loans. Although that gap narrowed considerably from just two weeks ago, it remains much wider than earlier this year.    Until April, rates on fixed-rate loans had been only about 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 percentage points above the initial rates on adjustable-rate mortgages. But when interest rates jumped in April -- and again in early September and mid-October -- the gap widened. Two weeks ago, rates on some fixed-rate loans exceeded 12%, while initial rates on some adjustable-rate mortgages stood at 7 1/4%.    As the spread widened, home buyers turned to adjustable-rate loans. In September, the latest month for which figures are available, 54% of newly issued mortgages had adjustable rates, compared with 22% in April, according to the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.    Now, lenders are betting that consumers will continue to be drawn to adjustable-rate loans, even if the spread with fixed-rate loans is narrower than in recent months. Among national lenders, Great Western, California Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association and Gibraltar Savings all recently increased initial rates on their most popular adjustable-rate loans to 7 3/4% from 7 1/2%.    In addition, many lenders have increased the so-called margin on adjustable-rate loans -- the amount they add to an index figure to determine the rate that a borrower pays.    For example, Great Western increased the margin on its most popular adjustable-rate loans to 2 1/4 percentage points from two percentage points. If the cost-of-funds index to which the loan is pegged is at 7 1/4%, the rate paid by the borrower would be 9 1/2%, up from 9 1/4% under the previous loan program. Such rates take effect after the teaser rate expires, generally in six months or a year, provided that any increase doesn't exceed the amount allowed under a loan's rate caps.    &quot;We think we can widen margins and still be very competitive with the adjustable-rate product,&quot; says Mr. Campbell of Great Western. Other lenders raised their margins to 2 1/8 percentage points from two percentage points.    An increase in the loan margin of one-quarter percentage point on a $100,000 loan costs a borrower $1,440 over the typical nine- to 10-year life of the loan, Mr. Anderman estimates.    Even with the higher rates and margins, many mortgage specialists say that with the roughly three-point spread, adjustable-rate mortgages remain a better buy. Mr. Anderman notes that even if interest rates surge, the rate caps that come with most adjustable-rate loans should keep the cost to a home buyer below the cost of fixed-rate mortgages for four or five years. </TEXT></DOC>
