Field of the Invention </PAR><PAR>  This invention relates to a process for the production of a biodegradable      sheet formed of chitosan and cellulose. </PAR><PAR>  In view of the recent increasing problems of environmental pollution, the      use of biodegradable plastics which are able to be decomposed by      microorganisms when left in soil is being encouraged. </PAR><PAR>  Japanese Published Unexamined Patent Application (Tokkyo Kokai) No.      Hei-2-6689 discloses a biodegradable composite sheet composed of cellulose      and chitosan. Because of its excellent biodegradability and cheapness of      its raw materials, this composite sheet will lend itself to a variety of      applications for, for example, packaging and farm materials. </PAR><PAR>  However, in order to actually put such a biodegradable sheet into practice,      several problems have been found to remain unsolved. Thus, according to      the method disclosed in the above Japanese patent publication, the      composite sheet is produced by mixing an aqueous acidic solution of      chitosan with fine cellulose fibers, shaping the resulting aqueous      dispersion into a sheet and drying. Because the aqueous dispersion is      viscous, air bubbles are apt to be trapped during the course of the      preparation of the dispersion and the air bubbles once entrapped cannot be      easily removed. Inclusion of air bubbles into the composite sheet causes      deterioration of the mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, of      the sheet. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The present invention has been made on the basis of is aimed at the      provision of an effective process which can produce a biodegradable sheet      composed of chitosan and cellulose fibers and having good mechanical      properties. </PAR><PAR>  In accordance with the present invention there is provided a process for      the preparation of a biodegradable sheet, comprising the steps of: </PAR><PAR>  (a) providing an aqueous dispersion having a viscosity of 50-1000 poises      and including 100 parts by weight of cellulose fibers having a length of 3      mm or less and a diameter of 50 .mu.m or less, and 2-100 parts by weight      of chitosan, said dispersion being maintained at a temperature T.sub.1      .degree.C. which is within the following range: </PAR><EQU>  t.ltoreq.T.sub.1 .ltoreq.tandplus;30 </EQU><PAL>  wherein t is the boiling point (.degree.C.) of water at a given reduced      pressure; </PAL><PAR>  (b) continuously introducing said dispersion having the temperature T.sub.1      .degree.

The aqueous dispersion may be      prepared by mixing cellulose fibers having a length of 3 mm or less and a      diameter of 50 .mu.m or less with an aqueous acidic solution of chitosan.      The content of chitosan in the dispersion should be 2-100 parts by weight      per 100 parts by weight of the cellulose fibers. </PAR><PAR>  Chitosan is a product obtained by deacetylation of chitin contained in      mycelia or crust of Crustacea such as crab or lobster. The molecular      weight and degree of deacetylation of the chitosan to be used in the      present invention are not specifically limited. However, a deacetylation      degree of at least 60% is desired for reasons of increased solubility.      Since chitosan as such is not soluble in water, chitosan is used in the      form of an acid salt, such as hydrochloride or the like inorganic acid      salt or formate, acetate, lactate or the like organic acid salt. </PAR><PAR>  Any cellulose fiber may be used for the purpose of the present invention.      Examples of suitable cellulose fibers include fibers formed of cellulose,      hemicellulose or lignocellulose obtained from wood, straw, cotton, jute,      bamboo or bagasse and cellulose produced by bacteria. Beaten fibers with a      length of 3 mm or less, preferably 1 mm or less and a diameter of 50 .mu.m      or less, preferably 30 .mu.m or less are suitably used in the present      invention. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous dispersion may further contain one or more additives such as a      filler, a plasticizer, an antifoamant and a colorant. Both organic filler      such as starch and inorganic fillers such as silica may be used. </PAR><PAR>  Referring to the FIGURE, the above aqueous dispersion is first introduced      into a temperature controller, generally a preheater, where the dispersion      is adjusted to a temperature T.sub.1 .degree.C. which is within the      following range: </PAR><EQU>  t.ltoreq.T.sub.1 .ltoreq.tandplus;30 </EQU><PAL>  wherein t is the boiling point, in terms of .degree.C., of water at a given      reduced pressure. </PAL><PAR>  The resulting dispersion having the temperature T.sub.1 .degree.C. is then      fed to a defoaming zone 2 which is generally defined in a cylindrical      housing chamber provided with a jacket through which a heat transfer      medium 11, such as warm water, is recirculated to maintain the inside of      the defoaming zone 2 at a temperature T.sub.2 .degree.C. which is within      the following range: </PAR><EQU>  t.ltoreq.T.sub.2 .ltoreq.tandplus;30 </EQU><PAL>  wherein t is as defined above. The temperatures T.sub.1 and T.sub.2      preferably have the following relationship: </PAL><EQU>  T.sub.1 -10.ltoreq.T.sub.2 .ltoreq.T.sub.1 andplus;15. </EQU><PAR>  A vacuum pump 10 is connected to the top of the defoaming zone 2 to      maintain the defoaming zone 2 at the abovementioned, given reduced      pressure. Preferably, the defoaming zone 2 is maintained at a reduced      pressure of 15-250 Torr., more preferably 15-200 Torr. </PAR><PAR>  In an upper portion of the defoaming zone is provided a guide plate member      3 which is so arranged that the aqueous dispersion supplied to the top of      the defoaming zone 2 can form a downwardly flowing laminar flow on the      inside surface of the defoaming zone 2. As a result of the above      construction of the defoaming zone 2, air bubbles contained in the aqueous      dispersion are removed during the downward movement of the laminar flow      thereof. Such a laminar flow may also be formed by directing the      dispersion radially outward from a rotating distributor mounted on the      center of the ceiling of a cylindrical housing as the defoaming zone 2. As      a consequence of the centrifugal force created by the rotating      distributor, the dispersion is fed to the upper portion of the vertical      side wall of the cylindrical housing 2 and forms a downwardly flowing      liquid film over the surface of the wall. </PAR><PAR>  It is important that the dispersion be maintained at the above-specified      temperature in the defoaming zone 2 in order to effect the defoaming      within a short period of time while minimizing the evaporation of water.      In particular, when the temperature T.sub.2 in the defoaming zone 2 is      below &quot;t&quot;, the defoaming rate becomes undesirably low. On the other hand,      when T.sub.2 is, higher than (tandplus;30), evaporation of water causes a change      in composition of the defoamed dispersion. For the similar reasons, it is      also important that the dispersion should be maintained at the      above-specified temperature T.sub.1 before introduction into the defoaming      zone 2. </PAR><PAR>  It is also very important that the dispersion introduced into the defoaming      zone should be transformed into downwardly flowing laminar flow in order      both to effectively perform the defoaming and to achieve the whole of the      process in a continuous mode. </PAR><PAR>  The aqueous dispersion thus defoamed in the defoaming zone 2 is      continuously discharged therefrom by a pump 4 and is continuously fed to a      die 5. In the die the dispersion is continuously passed by gravity through      a die slit 5 and molded into a sheet with a desired thickness on a belt      conveyer 6. The die slit has preferably an aperture of 0.5-5 mm. The sheet      on the conveyer 6 is continuously conveyed through a dryer 7. The dried      sheet or film is removed from the conveyer belt 6 by a touch roll 8 and is      taken up by a roll 9. </PAR><PAR>  In order to smoothly effect the molding, it is essential that the raw      material aqueous dispersion to be fed to the temperature controller 1 have      a viscosity of 50-1000 poises, preferably 100-500 poises. The term      &quot;viscosity&quot; used in the present specification is intended to refer to that      measured by a B-type viscometer at 23.degree. C. with a rotor revolution      speed of 4 rpm. The above viscosity range also plays an important role in      the defoaming step. More specifically, a viscosity of below 50 poises is      disadvantageous because it is difficult to form a sheet with a uniform      thickness. When the viscosity of the dispersion is greater than 1000      poises, on the other hand, it is difficult to effectively defoam the      dispersion. </PAR><PAR>  The following examples will further illustrate the present invention. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  Bleached pulp from a needle-leaved tree was beaten in water to obtain a      dispersion containing 4% by weight of cellulose fibers with a length of      0.5 mm or less and a diameter of 0.1 .mu.m or less. The dispersion (100      parts by weight) was then mixed with 20 parts by weight of an aqueous      solution containing 4% by weight of an acetic acid salt of chitosan, 3      parts by weight of glycerin as a plasticizer and 190 parts by weight of      water to obtain an aqueous dispersion having a viscosity of 140 poises.      The dispersion was continuously fed to a preheater and heated to      50.degree. C. Then the dispersion was continuously introduced into a      vacuum chamber maintained at a temperature of 50.degree. C. and a pressure      of 40 Torr. (the boiling point of water at this pressure is 33.degree. C.)      and provided with guide plates so that the dispersion was formed into a      laminar flow which flows downward along the inside wall of the vacuum      chamber, thereby to effect defoaming. The defoamed dispersion was      continuously discharged from the vacuum chamber. The average residence      time of the dispersion in the vacuum chamber was controlled to 3 minutes.      The discharged dispersion was continuously introduced into a die with a      slit size of 2 mm.times. 150 mm and molded into a sheet. The sheet was      continuously fed onto a conveyer belt running at a predetermined speed      through a drying oven to effect drying, thereby to obtain a film with a      uniform thickness of 50.mu.m. The film was found not to contain any air      bubbles. The appearance and mechanical properties of the film were very      good. The extrusion was able to be performed with good moldability. The      film was biodegradable. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  Example 1 was repeated in the same manner as described except that the      amount of water mixed with the cellulose fibers was decreased from 190      parts by weight to 100 parts by weight (the viscosity of the dispersion      was increased from 140 poises to 310 poises), thereby to obtain a      biodegradable film having a uniform thickness of 70 .mu.m and containing      no air bubbles. The appearance and mechanical properties of the film were      very good. The extrusion was able to be performed with good moldability. </PAR><PAC>  EXAMPLE 3 </PAC><PAR>  Example 1 was repeated in the same manner as described except that the      preheating temperature was lowered to 30.degree. C. and that the      temperature and pressure in the vacuum chamber were lowered to 30.degree.      C. and 20 Torr. (the boiling point of water at this pressure is 21.degree.      C.), respectively, thereby obtaining a biodegradable film with a uniform      thickness of 50 .mu.m and containing no air bubbles. The appearance and      mechanical properties of the film were very good. The extrusion was able      to be performed with good moldability. </PAR><PAC>  COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1 </PAC><PAR>  Example 1 was performed in the same manner as described except that the      dispersion produced was introduced as such without being preheated. The      film obtained had a uniform thickness of 50 .mu.m and contained air      bubbles. The mechanical properties of the film were not satisfactory. </PAR><PAC>  COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 </PAC><PAR>  Example 1 was repeated in the same manner as described except that the      preheating temperature was increased to 70.degree. C. and that the      temperature in the vacuum chamber was also increased to 70.degree. C.      thereby obtaining a biodegradable film with a uniform thickness of 50      .mu.m and containing no air bubbles. However, the evaporation of water      occurred significantly in the vacuum chamber to cause partial      concentration of the dispersion, so that the resulting film was poor in      appearance. </PAR><PAR>  The invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing      from the spirit or essential characteristics thereof. The present      embodiments are therefore to be considered in all respects as illustrative      and not restrictive, the scope of the invention being indicated by the      appended claims rather than by the foregoing description, and all the      changes which come within the meaning and range of equivalency of the      claims are therefore intended to be embraced therein. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
