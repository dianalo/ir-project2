The program includes field sampling,and chemical and physical analyses of air, surface and ground water,fish and wildlife, soil, foodstuffs, and natural vegetation. In additionto monitoring radioactivity in fish and wildlife, population numbersof key species are determined, usually during the breeding season. Datafrom monitoring efforts are used to assess the environmental impactsof Hanford operations and calculate the overall radiological dose tohumans onsite, at the Site perimeter, or residing in nearby communities.Chinook salmon spawning in the Columbia River at Hanford has increasedin recent years with a concomitant increase in winter nesting activityof bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus). An elk (Cervus elaphus) herd,established by immigration in 1972, is also increasing. Nesting Canadagoose (Branta canadensis) and great blue heron (Ardea herodias), andvarious other animals, e.g., mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) and coyotes(Canis latrans) are common. Measured exposure to penetrating radiationand calculated radiation doses to the public are well below applicableregulatory limits.</TEXT></DOC>
