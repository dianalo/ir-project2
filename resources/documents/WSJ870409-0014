Boesky claim that insider-trading penalties have wiped out the arbitrager's fortune. But lawyers and Wall Street rivals believe the statements may greatly understate Mr. Boesky's continued access to cash.    In a confidential financial statement circulated among lawyers recently, Mr. Boesky is understood to have reported a negative net worth of $3 million. Just last summer, Forbes magazine had ranked Mr. Boesky among the 400 wealthiest people in America, with an estimated fortune of $200 million.    Last November, Mr. Boesky agreed to pay $100 million in penalties to settle insider-trading charges brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Boesky also faces at least a half-dozen civil suits from investors, claiming they were injured by Mr. Boesky's alleged insider-trading.    A critical question in assessing Mr. Boesky's net worth is how to treat the considerable assets of his family. His wife, Seema Boesky, owns the bulk of their Westchester County, N.Y., estate, and owned nearly half of the Beverly Hills Hotel, which was sold for about $135 million last year. In addition, a limited partnership designed to benefit Mr. Boesky's children had invested $20 million in Mr. Boesky's last arbitrage fund.    &quot;I've heard that he's reporting a negative net worth,&quot; says George Reycraft, a lawyer at Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft. &quot;Well, I would be very concerned about assets missing from the list.&quot; Mr. Reycraft is acting for some former Boesky investors who are suing Mr. Boesky for failing to disclose his insider-trading activities when he solicited money from them.    The Boesky financial statements take a narrow view of Mr. Boesky's holdings, including only those in his name, sources said. The statement was circulated among attorneys for debenture holders in Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. L.P., the nearly $1 billion arbitrage fund that Mr. Boesky set up in March 1986.    But a footnote to the financial statements indicates that Mr. Boesky is due to get a &quot;receivable&quot; from his wife once certain financial matters are settled. It couldn't be learned how large the receivable is, and whether it would give Mr. Boesky a positive net worth once more.    One financial maneuver in the Boesky household last year is being investigated by the Federal Communications Commission. As previously reported, the FCC is investigating whether Mr. Boesky failed to disclose that he controlled KGMC-TV in Oklahoma City, and then transferred control of the station to his wife in December 1986 without government authorization.    In Washington, Mr. Boesky's attorney, Harvey Pitt, declined to comment on Mr. Boesky's financial affairs.    In Washington, top SEC officials, including enforcement director Gary Lynch and market regulation director Richard Ketchum, wouldn't comment on Mr. Boesky's finances. &quot;You can't get a look at it from us,&quot; Mr. Ketchum said of the statement.    Professionals in the securities market, however, voiced doubts that Mr. Boesky was anywhere near the end of his wealth. &quot;It doesn't make sense to me,&quot; said a one-time major debenture holder in Mr. Boesky's fund. Several arbitragers added that they believed Mr. Boesky's personal holdings at the time of the SEC sanctions were well above the $100 million penalty he paid.    One sizable expense for Mr. Boesky lately has been his legal bills. According to Mr. Boesky's financial statement, the law firms representing him are requiring him to set aside $5 million for anticipated legal expenses. Most of this money will go to the New York firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver andamp; Jacobson, where Mr. Pitt works, and the Washington firm of Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickering.    In a recent interview, Mr. Lynch said that Mr. Boesky divulged his finances to SEC officials at the start of settlement negotiations. &quot;If he lied to us about anything, we're in a position to say the entire settlement is breached and charge him with perjury and additional securities-law violations,&quot; Mr. Lynch said.    For this reason, he said, he doubts that Mr. Boesky would mislead the SEC on his assets, in the U.S. or abroad.    With all the civil suits seeking damages from Mr. Boesky, it's unclear whether plaintiffs might be able to make any claim on his family's assets. In recent weeks, Wall Street traders have repeatedly asserted that the Boeskys would seek a divorce to better protect the family's assets. But a source close to Mr. Boesky said yesterday: &quot;There has been no change in Mr. Boesky's marital status.&quot;    Meanwhile, precedent suggests that trying to collect money from Mr. Boesky is no easy task. County court papers in White Plains, N.Y., show that Sotheby's Inc., the auction house, was concerned enough about collecting payments from Mr. Boesky in 1985 that it placed a lien on five works of art he owned, including a Rodin sculpture and a Van Gogh painting. A Sotheby's spokeswoman declined to say whether the auction house ever did collect its money. </TEXT></DOC>
