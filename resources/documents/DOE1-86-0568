[/sup 3/H]XCC was observed to specifically bindto rat brain sagittal sections in a heterogenous pattern. Saturationexperiments revealed that [/sup 3/H]XCC binds with nanomolar affinityto 20{mu}m frozen tissue sections with the highest binding densitiesoccurring in the hippocampus and cerebellum. Both the binding characteristicsand regional receptor distribution obtained with [/sup 3/H]XCC demonstratethe potential usefulness of this new ligand in the study of adenosineA/sub 1/ receptors. 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
