The canal is important for oil shipping as well as for theUnited States and other countries who are massing warships in thePersian Gulf region.   The new security measures include putting any cement carriers atthe rear of canal convoys, so that if they are sunk they would notblock other vessels. Once sunk, cement carriers are extremelydifficult to clear because of the wet cement.   The canal carries much of Western Europe's oil and an extendedblockage would hit that region's economy hard. It could be almostruinous to Egypt, which is dependent on the more than $1.5 billionin foreign exchange earned annually by the canal.   Intelligence sources in Cairo said Friday the new canal measureswere in line with a security upgrade ordered nationwide onstrategic installations like the canal, the Aswan High Dam insouthern Egypt and vital industries.   The measures have been in effect since soon after Egyptcondemned Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and sent troops to jointhe U.S.-led multinational force deployed in the gulf region.   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has threatened to punish Arabstates that sided with Kuwait in the crisis.   Canal officials said authorities recently began careful checksof the itineraries and ownership of cement-carrying ships,particularly those coming from the Far East or the gulf region.   On Friday, a Romanian ship carrying cement, the 38,000-tonBeius, was the last of 30 vessels to transit the 101-mile longcanal. Its origin and destination were unclear.   The canal officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidthe Suez Canal Authority took the additional safeguard ofdispatching two tugboats to follow the Romanian ship through thewaterway.   They said more Egyptian harbor workers than usual have beenboarding cement-carrying ships. Such workers provide dockside andharbor services at the southern and northern ends of the canal,Suez and Port Said.   In addition, they report to Egyptian intelligence on anythingunusual found aboard ships.   Despite the canal's value to Egypt, President Gamal Abdel Nasserin 1956 scuttled two ships carrying concrete and stones to blockthe waterway. He aimed to hurt Western economies in reprisal for aconcerted military attack on Egypt by Britain, France and Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
