The natural-gas and oil producers are at odds with their coal-producing siblings, who refuse to let go of Washington's regulatory apron strings. Immediately at issue is repeal of the Power-plant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978, which effectively prohibits the use of natural gas or oil to fuel new electricity plants. A House energy subcommittee yesterday held hearings on repeal, and similar debate is scheduled today before a Senate subcommittee.    The Fuel Use Act is a dinosaur left over from the &quot;energy crisis&quot; of the 1970s. At that time coal was very much favored by the federal policy makers and congressional legislators who thought they were managing the energy crisis. America was &quot;running out&quot; of energy, they said, and so America needed a &quot;coal-capability&quot; requirement. This regulation says that any new plant must have the potential to use coal in case supplies of oil or gas run dry.    The natural-gas, oil and coal industries do agree that part of the legislation's restrictions should be lifted to allow use of any of these fuels in new electricity plants. But they disagree over a key part of the existing law covering &quot;coal capability.&quot; Carl Bagge, president of the National Coal Association, says his &quot;kind of flexibility is sound public policy.&quot; But is it really?    If nothing else, the public policy behind the fuel act has been expensive. Some telling figures were recently published by the Electric Power Research Institute, a trade group with no particular bias toward any fuel. It calculated that the costs of capital investment, as well as operation and maintenance (apart from fuel), of gasified-coal power plants are nearly three times those of natural-gas facilities. Moreover, it said that requiring &quot;emergency&quot; coal capability, as the fuel act mandates, adds costs of $28 million to $34 million per plant per year. That translates to increased electricity costs at these plants of $98 to $196 a year for the average residential consumer.    In a hearing yesterday before a House energy subcommittee, Nicholas Bush, head of the Natural Gas Supply Association, described how this set of federal regulations has disrupted the domestic energy market. With the price mechanism artificially controlled, U.S. government controls generated a natural-gas shortage in the mid-1970s. Then, once regulators recognized the &quot;shortage&quot; several years later, a new set of rules led to the current surplus of deliverable gas. &quot;The last 25 years,&quot; Mr. Bush said, &quot;clearly have taught that the federal government is not well-equipped to protect consumers through tinkering in energy markets.&quot;    Energy regulation, as an intellectual exercise, is dead. There is little point in continuing to flog these misbegotten energy policies into shape now. We do have a certain amount of sympathy with coal producers, who after all had to live in whatever world the energy bureaucrats created for them. The fact remains that energy-redundant power plants make no sense. The Fuel Use Act makes no sense either. </TEXT></DOC>
