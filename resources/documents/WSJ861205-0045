Repligen Corp. developed the vaccine with help from researchers at Malvern, Pa.-based Centocor Inc., Duke University Medical School and the National Cancer Institute. The biotechnology concern said the vaccine, injected into goats, generated antibodies in the animals that &quot;neutralized&quot; the AIDS virus in test-tube experiments.    Repligen cautioned, however, that its results don't necessarily mean that the vaccine will work in humans. Moreover, developing a human vaccine is expected to take years.    Repligen's study, to be published in the Dec. 12 issue of the journal Science, follows similar test-tube results using a different prototype vaccine announced earlier this year by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif. Several companies are working on a vaccine against acquired immune deficiency syndrome.    Repligen's vaccine is an artificially produced fragment of a protein found on the surface of the AIDS virus. By mimicking the virus, the fragment may be able to induce an immune response against the virus in humans without causing AIDS.    Unlike Genentech's vaccine, which was produced using cells of Chinese hamsters, Repligen's was made using bacteria cells. Repligen asserted that the use of bacteria should enable it to produce large quantities of the vaccine more cheaply than similar vaccines made with mammalian cells. </TEXT></DOC>
