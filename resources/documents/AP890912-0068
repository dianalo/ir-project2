(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The man who directed the Miss AmericaPageant for 35 years, firing Bert Parks and presiding over thedethroning of Vanessa Williams, was in critical condition todayafter suffering a heart attack.   Albert A. Marks Jr., 76, was stricken at home Monday and taken toShore Memorial Hospital, said hospital spokeswoman Margie Barham.   Marks retired in 1988 after directing the pageant as a volunteerfor 35 years. He was succeeded by lawyer Leonard Horn, the pageant'sfirst full-time, paid director. Marks was stricken days before thisyear's pageant.   ``Of course, the pageant will go on,'' Horn said of this week'spreliminaries and finals Saturday night. ``Al, above all, wouldunderstand that.''   As director, Marks had the final say in every aspect of thepageant, from the production numbers to the judges to the volunteerhostesses who chaperone the 51 contestants.   Marks, an investment broker, carried the pageant from a publicitystunt designed to extend Atlantic City's summer resort season into amultimillion-dollar TV production.   He defended the pageant from criticism from the women's movement,the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,labor organizations and others.   Marks fired host Parks, replacing him first with actor Ron Elyand then with the current host, Gary Collins. Parks was host from1955 to 1979, singing ``There She Is'' as the pageant's winnerwalked down the runway.   Marks also presided over the board of directors when it liftedthe crown of Miss America 1984, Vanessa Williams, after nude photosof her appeared in Penthouse.   In the 1960s, Marks was the first to suggest dropping thecontroversial swimsuit competition, but was overruled by pageantdirectors and fans. Horn has since tried to reduce the significanceof the swimsuit contest by lowering its value in the judging.</TEXT></DOC>
