But Judge Maximiano Asuncion sentenced Orlando Dulay to 10 monthsin prison and fined him the equivalent of $50 for trying to stranglethe governor and holding other officials and employees of Quirinoprovince during the Aug. 28, 1987 coup attempt, in which 53 peoplewere killed in Manila.   It was the most serious of about a half-dozen coup attempts sincePresident Corazon Aquino rose to power in a February 1986 revoltthat sent Marcos into exile in Hawaii.   Records of the case show that Dulay and about 50 rebel soldiersand police barged into the capitol building in the Qurino provincialcapital of Cabarroguis and announced a takeover of the localgovernment.   But in acquitting Dulay and four other defendants, Asuncion saidthat announcing a takeover and appointing new officials ``are notsufficient to hold them liable for the crime of rebellion.''   ``To constitute rebellion, there must be some sort of publicuprising which is absent in the instant case,'' said the judge.``And when we say public uprising, there must be men engaging in waragainst the forces of government.''   ``In order to commit the crime rebellion, there must be publicuprising and taking of arms against the government,'' the judgeadded.   Dulay has been in jail since March 1987 _ longer than hissentence. But Asuncion did not order Dulay's release because hefaces charges of murdering two supporters of Mrs. Aquino during theFebruary 1986 presidential election.   Dulay was in jail in Quirino, 100 miles north of Manila, pendingtrial on the murder charges when the coup attempt began. Some of thesoldiers and policemen who preceded him to the capitol buildingduring the brief takeover were his prison guards.   During the trial, prosecutors presented witnesses who describedhow Dulay wrung the neck of Gov. Renicolas Delizo and yelled:``Goddamn, you will die, I will kill you.'' Dulay, who was dressedin military combat fatigues, then put a gun to Delizo's head, thewitnesses said.   Dulay and his armed followers next herded Delizo and others intothe governor's office and held them there until midnight, when itbecame clear in Manila that the coup attempt had failed.   Dulay acknowledged that he grabbed Delizo by the neck but claimedthat was merely for ``psychological effect.''   He also said it was not he was who tried to takeover Quirino.   Dulay headed the provincial chapter of the New Society Movementin Quirino.   He and his followers were accused of murdering two civilianscampaigning for Mrs. Aquino in Quirino during the 1986 electionwhich both Mrs. Aquino and Marcos claimed they won.   Dulay was arrested shortly after Marcos left, but escaped from asuburban Manila military prison. He resurfaced in the United Statesbut was expelled back to Manila on March 18, 1987.   Last June, armed men attacked the stockade at Manila's CampCrame, where Dulay was held, in what the military said was a bid tofree him. The group failed to free Dulay but looted the garrison'sarmory.</TEXT></DOC>
