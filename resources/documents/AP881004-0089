Meeting with Republican congressional leaders in the CabinetRoom of the White House, Reagan complained that the House-passeddrug bill has been ``sitting on the Senate calendar for days.''   He said that since Congress has enacted the 13 appropriationsbills necessary for continuing government operations into thefiscal year which began last Saturday, the anti-drug legislation isthe lone major business that has been left unfinished.   ``I think it's time for Congress to go home,'' the presidentsaid. ``I want to urge the Senate to pass a responsible drug bill... so that it can be quickly conferenced and enacted and then I'llwish the 100th Congress a hearty adieu.''   Reagan's statements came as senators were negotiating privatelyon crucial time-limiting agreements that could enable Congress topass the anti-drug bill before adjournment.   Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas said the bill wasbeing held up by ``Democrats playing games with parental leave andchild care and minimum wage; if they'd stop playing games and berealistic, we could do a drug bill this week, but we can't carry onthis charade on the Senate floor. We could be here another two orthree weeks.''   A bipartisan group of sponsors introduced the drug measureMonday. But they agreed the Senate will run out of time if longdebates ensue over controversial issues such as user penalties andadmission of illegally seized evidence.   Even if the Senate overcame its own time obstacles, it stillwould need to agree to a compromise with the House _ which approvedits own drug measure this month, 375-30.   Sen. Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said no senator wants to be heldresponsible for preventing the drug bill from coming to a vote.Sponsors said they were working on arrangements to limit amendmentsto about a half-dozen from each party.   Even if a drug bill is enacted this year, it would face seriousfinancing problems.   The Senate bill is a two-year package that would authorize about$2 billionin new spending, but only $450 million may be availableimmediately, according to 14 sponsors who discussed the bill at anews conference.   About $250 million of that figure would come from expectedrevenue increases from tougher Internal Revenue Service taxenforcement.   Rudman said he would propose an amendment to a technical taxbill that would increase taxes on alcohol and tobacco products topay for the drug bill. Other lawmakers said the proposal wouldfail, and suggested taking the money from existing programs.   In a strategic decision that might prevent some delayingtactics, sponsors decided to include a death penalty provision aspart of the original legislation. This could prevent a long debateby capital punishment supporters to win inclusion of the provision.   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said he will offer amendments forstrict user penalties such as denial of federal benefits for anyoneconvicted of drug sales or use.   Other senators are expected to offer an amendment to allowadmission in federal court of evidence seized illegally, but in``good faith.''   Key provisions in the Senate bill would:   _Make substance abuse treatment on request an explicit goal, andfinance increased treatment capacity.   _Authorize money for state and local law enforcement grants.   _Permit the death penalty for drug kingpins who intentionallyorder a killing; for hired killers who commit murder as part of acontinuing drug enterprise; and for anyone who kills a lawenforcement officer in a drug-related crime.   _Create a Cabinet-level ``drug czar'' to coordinate federalanti-drug efforts.   _Authorize money for new prison construction, and more publicdefenders, drug enforcement agents, FBI agents, prosecutors,marshals, Coast Guard personnel, immigration officers, and alcohol,tobacco and firearms agents.   _Strengthen penalties for drug offenses committed within 1,000feet of a school, purchasing drugs from children, distributingdrugs to children, or employing youngsters to sell drugs.</TEXT></DOC>
