Unfortunately, this drama wasn't in thescript.   During the climax of &quot;La Picara Sonadora,&quot; (&quot;TheMischievous Dreamer&quot;), a five-year-old actor commits acardinal sin: He won't cry on cue. Nearly beside herself, thedirector shouts &quot;Sentamentalismo]&quot; An impatient starlet tapsher high heels. The leading man's aplomb is slipping -- as isthe silk jacket draped over his shoulders.</LP><TEXT>   Finally, the director gives up, and tells the makeup manto apply eye drops to the boy's cheeks. &quot;Unless this boylearns how to cry,&quot; says the starlet petulantly, &quot;hispossibilities for advancement in Mexican television will beextremely limited.&quot;   So ends another episode in the making of a smoldering,south-of-the-border TV drama known here as a telenovela.Produced by Televisa, Mexico's giant private communicationsmonopoly, they are probably the world's most widely wept-oversoap operas. The serials account for almost half ofTelevisa's programming, and are exported to 59 countries,from Argentina to Malaysia to Russia.   &quot;Mexicans have a way with soaps, and there are lots ofaddicts out there,&quot; says Alan Duncan, a production executivefor ABC's &quot;General Hospital.&quot;   When a Mexican diplomat traveled to Beijing a while back,a band welcomed him not with the Mexican national anthem butwith the theme from the telenovela &quot;Rosa Salvaje&quot; (&quot;WildRose&quot;). The President of Brazil recently made time during aneconomic emergency to meet a visiting Mexican soap star. InSpain, merchants adjusted store hours to avoid conflict withthe broadcast of a Mexican telenovela. Last year, a Mexicansoap was No. 1 in South Korea, and struck such a chord therethat many viewers thought the program was produced in Seoul.   The sun never sets on telenovelas -- to the dismay ofno-nonsense Mexicans like Mercedes Corti. This travel agentsays she gets enraged when she finds employees discussingplot twists of telenovelas instead of selling tickets. Soimagine her dismay when she took a junket to Istanbul,Turkey, turned on the TV in her hotel room and gazed upon theopening credits of &quot;Los Ricos Tambien Lloran,&quot; (&quot;The RichAlso Cry&quot;). &quot;Los Ricos&quot; was then the top-rated program inTurkey.   Mexican soap makers say they owe their success to a wealthof off-screen inspiration. &quot;In Mexico, emotions and actionstend toward dramatic extremes,&quot; says Raquel Parot, atelenovela director. &quot;The soap opera is a reflection ofreality, not a distortion of it.&quot;   Lately, in fact, the two greatest Mexican soap stars,Veronica Castro and Lucia Mendez, have been embroiled in apassionate off-the-set melodrama. The set-to started on atalk show when Ms. Castro spoke disparagingly of the Mendezfamily: specifically, that Ms. Mendez's young son was ugly,taking after his parents. Ms. Mendez struck back in her nightclub act. She parodied her rival's TV show by featuring a mandressed up as Ms. Castro. One line: &quot;Veronica has a figurelike a Coca-Cola -- in a can, not a bottle.&quot;   Mexicans may love telenovelas, but it took the far-flungTelevisa to see that the well-made dramas would play inplaces far beyond Guadalajara. The company built its ownfactory to produce makeup so durable that it would hold upunder the frequent tears of telenovela characters. Thestudio's special effects are world class, though the simplyreproduced sound of a slamming door is the most commonlyused. Televisa even runs its own acting school, whereaspiring leading men practice hand-kissing and starlets learnhow to flounce.   Much of this soap opera infrastructure sprang up duringthe past decade -- an era of economic depression in Mexico,but a time when telenovelas attained the highest ratings intheir 30-year history. Sociologists say that soaps allowedMexicans to focus on someone else's problems and forget theirown. Thus, &quot;Rosa Salvaje,&quot; a 1988 serial about a lowly streetvendor who ascends into high society, reached a record 80% ofMexican television viewers.   Certain conventions of telenovelas differ from those ofU.S. soap operas. The daily, hour-long Mexican soaps aretransmitted at night, rather than in the day. And unlikeAmerican soaps, which can go on for decades, telenovelasusually are wrapped up in five months. Thus, the standardtelenovela story-line -- the romantic first encounter,followed by the heart-rending breakup and the heart-warmingreconciliation -- is compressed into a veritable dramaticwhirlwind. The one thing telenovela viewers won't see a lotof is sex. Two months into one recent soap, the leading manand his love interest hadn't even had their first kiss.   To meet the enormous demand for soaps, Televisa hasdeveloped production shortcuts that make it unnecessary forstars to memorize scripts, or even read them. Actors areequipped with electronic receivers, tiny enough to fitunobtrusively in an ear, that pick up dialogue read by anoffstage prompter. This allows Televisa to produce moreminutes of programming each day than any other studio, says&quot;General Hospital's&quot; Mr. Duncan, who has taught at Televisa'ssoap school.   Televisa's latest hit, &quot;La Picara Sonadora,&quot; was a classicof the genre. The Cinderella story centers on GuadalupeLopez, a young woman who migrates to Mexico City to work in adepartment store. She is industrious -- and beautiful -- butso poor she must lodge secretly in a bedroom suite in thestore's furniture department. Alfredo Rochild, the rakishheir to the department store chain, meets Guadalupe and issmitten. Hiding his true identity, Alfredo goes to work as aclerk in the toy department to woo her.   One key to the program's success (its ratings were above70% by its conclusion in December) was its attention to thesubtle images that hold deep meaning for Mexicans. In one keyscene, Alfredo goes to a hospital to visit Giovana, hisfeckless -- and beautiful -- fiancee, who has had a seriousmotorcycle wreck.   &quot;My last thought was of you, dear,&quot; Giovana whispers fromher sickbed.   &quot;Cut,&quot; the director orders.   What's the matter? ask the actors. &quot;No cross,&quot; thedirector replies. Huh? &quot;She survived the accident, so therehas to be a cross on the wall above the bed.&quot; The hospitalwall would certainly look bare to the 90% of Mexicans who areRoman Catholic. The prop manager quickly fills the space witha crucifix.   While such touches are important, producer ValentinPimstein suggests that the popularity of telenovelas has adeeper, cultural basis. &quot;Telenovelas revolve around strong,almost saintly, maternal figures,&quot; he says. Mr. Pimsteinconsciously decided to name &quot;La Picara's&quot; virtuous leadcharacter Guadalupe, after the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico'spatron saint. The major subplot involves a tiny orphan whofinds a surrogate mother in a strong-willed widow. &quot;This is avery Mexican story, but it will also do well in Egypt becausethe Arabs have mothers, too,&quot; says Mr. Pimstein.   And as Guadalupe Lopez herself said, &quot;People all over theworld have dreams.&quot; She might have been speaking aboutCecilia Vargas, who recently migrated to a shantytown on theoutskirts of Mexico City. Like Guadalupe, Ms. Vargas has fewpossessions: A fruit crate is her chair and a cardboard boxher television stand. Of course, the set was tuned everynight to &quot;La Picara Sonadora.&quot; Says Ms. Vargas: &quot;Thistelenovela shows the truth: Anything is possible in Mexico.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
