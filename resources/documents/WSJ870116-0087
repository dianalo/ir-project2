A spokesman for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Co. unit of the Seattle-based aerospace and defense concern said plans for the order were announced in Paris by an official of the French state-owned airline. The Boeing spokesman said the planes, designed to carry more than 400 passengers and fly long-range, would be delivered between 1992 and 1997.    Air France indicated it will sign an agreement covering the purchase before the end of the month, Boeing said. It said that an engine hasn't been selected for the Air France jetliners.    The 747-400, which at a price of about $125 million each is Boeing's costliest plane, has been a major success since NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines unit ordered the first ones in 1985. Boeing already has taken orders for 59 of the jumbo jets from eight carriers in the U.S., Europe and Asia.    Airline interest in the plane was an important factor in Boeing taking aircraft orders in 1986 valued at a record $19.2 billion. In the year, airlines ordered a total of 341 jetliners from the company.    Air France currently flies 33 other-model 747s, accounting for about a third of its fleet.    The airline official also said Air France &quot;is considering&quot; an order of six or seven A-340 aircraft produced by Airbus, a consortium of French, British and West German aircraft companies. That long-range jet, which isn't yet being built by Airbus, would be delivered in the mid-1990s if an order is placed, the Air France official said.    While Air France generally has favored Airbus products in recent fleet decisions, its choice of the 747-400 indicates that Boeing competitors haven't yet come up with a plane that can match its 8,000-mile range and high passenger load.    Separately, Boeing Commercial said the Federal Aviation Administration had approved longer-range, over-water operations for certain models of two Boeing twin-engine jetliners, the 737 and 757. The wide-body 767 previously had qualified for over-water operations on transatlantic and other routes that once were barred to planes with fewer than three engines. The 737 and 757 are the first narrow-body jets to qualify under FAA guidelines set in 1985 to open some over-water routes to twin-engine jets, a Boeing spokesman said.    The spokesman said the latest FAA ruling &quot;enhances the marketing appeal&quot; of the 737 and 757 because airlines will have more flexibility in using the aircraft. </TEXT></DOC>
