(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL gave founder Jim Bakker bonuses as bigas $500,000 even while it was losing money, the ministry's formerfinance director testified Wednesday.   ``We're spending as if there's no crisis,'' Peter Bailey said ina July 1984 memo to Bakker and PTL executive vice president RichardDortch.   Bailey testified about his warnings in the U.S. District courttrial of Bakker, who is charged with 24 counts of fraud andconspiracy for allegedly diverting nearly $4 million from thetax-exempt ministry. Bakker left PTL in disgrace in March 1987 in asex and money scandal.   The prosecution testimony followed stories earlier this week fromBakker's ``lifetime partners'' _ people who gave meager savings forthe promise of guaranteed lodging at his theme park, but were turnedaway because rooms weren't built with their donations.   The wife of a disabled coal miner told the jury Tuesday that shethought her $1,000 contribution to PTL guaranteed a cheap vacationfor her 13 children. But she said never was given a room.   Contributions to PTL hit a five-year low in 1986, Bailey wrote inan Oct. 6 memo, dropping to $3.5 million that September.   Bailey said he wouldn't write checks except for emergencies. Butthe PTL board voted a $500,000 bonus for Jim Bakker and $100,000 forhis wife, Tammy Faye, on Nov. 3, about four months before Bakker'sreign ended at PTL.   Bailey said he frequently had to take money from lifetime partneraccounts to pay bonuses to Bakker and Dortch, as well as salary,payroll and other expenses. Partners paid $1,000 in return for thepromise of lifetime lodging privileges at Bakker's Heritage USAretreat and theme park.   Bailey said in the memo that numerous accounts were overdue by 90days and some vendors were not being paid at all.   Among Bailey's warnings:   _ Bailey said he wrote in a March 16, 1984, memo that ``Every daybrings us into a deeper crisis,'' and that more than $700,000 wasneeded to meet the payroll. Less than two weeks later, recordsshowed that Bakker received a $390,000 bonus from the board.   _ In 1983, Bailey said, he warned Bakker that he was dipping intoPTL's savings account to pay operating expenses and that Bakkerapproved. Ten days earlier, the board approved bonuses totaling$150,000 for the Bakkers.   _ Bailey said he told Bakker in November 1983 that contributionsfor the month totaled $4.7 million and expenditures were $6.8million. Two weeks later, prosecutor Deborah Smith said, the boardvoted another $150,000 bonus for the Bakkers.   _ On Sept. 6, 1985, Bailey warned Bakker the ministry wassurviving on lifetime partner donations and said cuts of 40 percentwere needed immediately in the ministry payroll. On Nov. 12, 1985,the prosecution said, Bakker got a $250,000 bonus from the board.   A Tulsa, Okla., attorney testified late Wednesday afternoon thathe, too, had expressed concerns about the partnership program.   Charles Chapel, who was hired to represent PTL in March 1986 whenthe ministry was responding to an Internal Revenue Service Audit for1981-83, said he told ministry officials the lifetime partnershipsshould be separated from general contributions.   Chapel was withdrawn from the PTL account in September 1986. Hesaid Dortch had told him the ministry wanted to hire another lawfirm to represent PTL in an upcoming IRS audit for 1984-85.   After he was replaced, Chapel wrote Bakker a letter saying, ``Youhave got to get your church under control or it will be lost.''   If convicted, Bakker could be sentenced to 120 years in prisonand fined more than $5 million.   Dortch pleaded guilty to similar charges and was sentenced toeight years in prison and fined $200,000.</TEXT></DOC>
