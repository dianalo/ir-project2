Fiber optic products can be effective, reliable,and cost-competitive for many petroleum, chemical, pulp and paper, andplastic industry plants. The products are available as current optionswith equipment vendors or as third-party components that interface withexisting systems. In industrial plants, control and communication signalsare becoming more sophisticated to keep up with demands of efficiencyand speed in present day operations. Most of these systems presentlyuse copper as a medium for signal transmission. Copper cable, however,is limited in speed, reliability, endurance, electrical isolation, androuting within the plant. These problems are especially acute in certainindustrial plants because of the expected plant life, lightning problems,high humidity, corrosive gases, and fire hazards. This article describesvarious applications of fiber optic products in the plant environmentand points out their advantages over copper in many processing systems.</TEXT></DOC>
