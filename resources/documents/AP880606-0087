North and three co-defendantscould get a fair trial on conspiracy charges.   U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell handed independent counselLawrence E. Walsh a significant pre-trial victory by rejecting thedefense's wide-ranging request for ocuments relating to suchoperations as U.S. intelligence gathering in Iran and efforts tofree American hostages in Lebanon.   But the judge again expressed reservations about whether thedefendants could get a fair trial on charges they conspired todefraud the government by diverting profits from the U.S.-Iran armssales to the Nicaraguan rebels.   The prosecution's conspiracy case relates ``to a wide course ofconduct that has to explain why each individual was involved, whatgot him into it, what he was doing before,'' Gesell said.   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel who was fired from theNational Security Council staff, former national security adviserJohn M. Poindexter, and arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired AirForce Maj. Gen. Richard V. Secord, are charged together in threecounts of the 23-count indictment returned in March.   The judge questioned whether the restrictions on the use ofclassified documents in a public trial would unfairly inhibit thedefendants' ability to present evidence that they were merely actingin accordance with procedures established for other covertoperations known to their superiors in the government.   ``When a man is accused of a crime, he ought to be able to get onthe stand and tell his side of the story if he wants to,'' Gesellsaid.   But that right could be restricted if the defendants want to say``I'd been doing these things time and time again in other covertoperations with the approval of Cabinet officials.''   ``I really expect that if the defendants take the stand ... theyare going to spill all over with classified information,'' Gesellsaid, adding that he had ``no stomach'' for censoring thedefendants' testimony.   Testimony about other covert operations the defendants may haveparticipated in could be prohibited under the Classified InformationProcedures Act by the government's unwillingness to expose theinformation in court, Gesell said.   Such testimony would be important to the defense because it dealswith ``that abstract question that the jury must decide _ what wason the man's mind'' when he participated in the Iran-Contra affair,Gesell said.   ``What causes the problem here is the conspiracy counts,'' thejudge said, repeating a reservation he voiced May 26 during ahearing on the legal problems posed by limited immunity that North,Poindexter and Hakim received from Congress for their testimony lastyear before the Iran-Contra hearings on Capitol Hill.   The judge suggested that the prosecution try other counts, whichinclude charges that North and Poindexter made false statements andobstructed congressional inquiries into covert aid theadministration gave to the Nicaraguan rebels.   But Walsh argued that the ``conspiracy counts are really vital asa unifying function in the indictment. The evidence in those countsis going to be really straightforward.''   Gesell's denial of the pre-trial discovery request came two daysafter the CIA said in court papers that few people other thanPresident Reagan are cleared to review the highly sensitive materialsought by the defense.   The CIA estimated that the defense request would require ``thereview of literally millions of pages of highly classifieddocuments.''   The 87-page request included attempts by the defense to obtainclassified U.S.-Israeli communications when Israel shipped missilesto Iran in 1985 to start the arms-for-hostage deals.</TEXT></DOC>
