The civil complaint isn't related to much-larger spillsthat occurred in the same area in recent months, the U.S.attorney said.</LP><TEXT>   According to the U.S. attorney, Exxon's Exxon Co. U.S.A.unit, Linden, N.J., refused to pay a total $1,350 of finesthe Coast Guard imposed from 1985 to 1987 because the oilcompany claims the minor spills didn't harm the environment.The spills occurred in the Kill Van Kull and Arthur Killwaterways, which separate New Jersey from Staten Island, N.Y.   Exxon couldn't be reached for comment. The New Yorkcompany and its Exxon Shipping Co. unit recently pleadedinnocent to five-count criminal indictments, charging themwith violating various federal laws in the nation's worst oilspill a year ago.
