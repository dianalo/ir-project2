Two soldiers and all threeguerrillas were killed, Israel said.   Two soldiers were wounded, one seriously with a bullet wound inhis chest, in the bloodiest border clash since Palestinian riotsbroke out in the Israeli- occupied territories to the south on Dec.8.   The military command said Israel also deported six Palestinianguerrillas on Tuesday. The army would not specify where the sixwere taken, but neighboring Lebanon was the most likely destination.   The army said the six were among 50 guerrillas of the PalestineLiberation Organization's mainstream Fatah branch captured on Feb.7, 1987. The 50 were aboard the small cargo ship Maria R, whichflew a Honduran flag and was seized midway in its journey fromLarnaca, Cyprus, to Lebanon.   Arab guerrillas captured by Israel are usually sentenced toprison terms in Israel. The Jewish state has expelled 20Palestinians from the occupied territories since the unrest startednearly five months ago.   In the Gaza Strip, the army blocked hundreds of Palestiniansfrom reaching jobs in Israel by confiscating their ID cards andrequiring them to undergo checks at government offices.   The government also temporarily revoked the press credentials oftwo foreign journalists, Martin Fletcher of NBC News and GlennFrankel of The Washington Post, for failing to submit theirdispatches to military censorship.   The border attack began before dawn when an Israeli patroldiscovered footprints northeast of the town of Kiriyat Shimona, anarmy spokesman said.   For hours, troops lit the skies with flares and searched for theintruders, the spokesman said.   The soldiers found the guerrillas about 200 yards inside theborder and fired.   The guerrillas responded by hurling hand grenades and firing arocket, the spokesman said.   Lebanese police said earlier that the attack occurred inLebanese territory near Kfar Shouba. But a Syrian-backed group thatparticipated in the firefight later said it occurred in Israel.   A soldier involved in the clash said troops and guerrillas weresix feet away from each other when the fighting began.   ``They were hiding on a deep slope inside a maze of trees,'' thesoldier, who would not give his name, told Israel radio. ``It wasnot possible to see them. From inside the maze the terroristsopened fire.''   The army identified the dead soldiers as Lt. Col. Shmuel Adiv,29, a battalion commander of the elite Givati infantry unit, andSgt. Ramzi Wahsh, 27, a Bedouin scout.   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of northern command, identified theguerrillas as Palestinians and said their target was civiliansettlements.   Police spokesmen in Beirut said it was a seven-man guerrillaring belonging to two pro-Soviet groups, the Lebanese Communistparty and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine led byGeorge Habash.   But Israel said there were only three infiltrators and anIsraeli military official told Israel radio that documents found onthem showed they belonged to the Syrian-backed Democratic Front forthe Liberation of Palestine led by Naif Hawatme.   Later Tuesday, Hawatme's group said the attack occurred inIsrael and that 12 Israeli soldiers were killed.   Both the Israeli army and Lebanese police said two Israelisoldiers and three guerrillas were killed.   In a communique, Hawatme's group said the attack was staged by``Martyr Abu Jihad Wazir squad,'' referring to the PLO militarycommander assassinated in Tunis April 16, apparently by Israelicommandos.   The communique claimed the fighting lasted from daybreak tomidafternoon and said heavy machine guns and grenades were used.Earlier, a police spokesman said fighting broke out at 3:30 a.m.and the ``fierce clash'' raged for about three hours.   The incident marked the 11th infiltration or attemptedinfiltration since Nov. 25, when a lone guerrilla landed a hangglider in northern Israel and attacked a military base. He killedsix soldiers in a hail of grenades before being shot to death.   Israeli officials have linked the attempts to the uprising inthe territories. According to U.N. figures, 173 Palestinians andtwo Israelis have died since Dec. 8.   In Gaza, Christine Dabagh, a spokeswoman for the United NationsRelief and Works Agency, said the army had taken the ID cards ofhundreds of Gazans and had ordered them to report to three separateoffices to check if they owed money for taxes.   The measures appeared aimed at breaking a tax boycott that hasbeen a tactic of the Palestinian uprising.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin was quoted as tellingparliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee that fightingthe uprising cost the army $257.5 million to date.</TEXT></DOC>
