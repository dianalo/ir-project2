New Zealanders feel the diplomatic cold shoulder they have beengiven by successive U.S. administrations has gone on too long sincethey banned American warships from their ports in 1984.   Foreign Minister Russell Marshall told reporters Palmer's tripcould prove the catalyst to let New Zealand out of the ``diplomaticsin bin.''   Almost every other country in the world except Libya, Iran, NorthKorea and New Zealand have access to top levels of the U.S.administration, he complained.   In an interview this week, Palmer said he will not seekappointments with U.S. officials but sent a clear signal thatunofficial contacts would be welcome.   ``As part of the process of meeting various people at the UnitedNations, obviously I will be having bilateral talks with a number ofdifferent government officials,'' he said, adding he would meet anyAmericans ``if they seek a meeting with me.''   But Palmer said he is not disposed ``to go cap in hand'' seekinghigher-level access in Washington.   ``The American administration has not warmed to our policy ofnuclear-free New Zealand,'' he said. ``They have decided the ANZUS(Australia, New Zealand, U.S. military) alliance should beinoperative as a result of that policy ...   ``I think they have really locked themselves into a position theycan't easily retreat from. But we accept their position.''   Palmer, 47, once emigrated to the United States. He lived therefor six years, graduated in law from the University of Chicago andwas professor of law at the University of Iowa and University ofVirginia. He has a son studying law at Yale and will visit him thereduring his four-day stay starting Oct. 2.   ``We've got many shared democratic values, free speech and commonattitudes on a lot of international issues,'' Palmer said of the twocountries. ``I'm very fond of the United States. I love itsdiversity and its pluralism and its commitment to free speech. Ialways quote to Americans when they talk about our nuclear policy,the words of Patrick Henry: `Give me Liberty or give me death.'''   New Zealand banned U.S. warships because Washington refuses toconfirm or deny whether they carry atomic weapons.   Palmer said he will address the General Assembly on the dangersof driftnet fishing in the Pacific, a matter on which he thinks NewZealand and the United States have a common interest.   He said he would be speaking for small island states of theSouthwest Pacific whose stability, economies and environment arethreatened.   Japanese and Taiwanese trawlers set nets up to 30 miles long thatare ``environmentally disastrous'' catching ``whales, seals, birds,everything,'' he said.   Drift net fishing is depleting tuna and salmon stocks, a matterof concern to Americans and Canadians, he said.   ``President Bush's attitude to environmental issues encourages mea great deal,'' said Palmer. ``I welcome the greening of America, ifI can put it that way.''</TEXT></DOC>
