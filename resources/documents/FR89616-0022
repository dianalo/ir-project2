An EFP application to harvest groundfish with bottom trawl gear using detachablecodends of various mesh sizes in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) offthe coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California was received on March23, 1989. The application represents the third of four phases of the WestCoast Groundfish Mesh Size Study, and the second of two years of fieldwork that began in 1988. The major goal of the experimental fishery isto compare the composition of catches under current mesh size regulationsthat implement the FMP, to catches that result from the use of differentmesh sizes. Current groundfish regulations at 50 CFR 663.26 prohibit theuse of a mesh size smaller than four and one-half inches in bottom trawlsand prohibit detachable codends if the vessel is carrying a net with smallerthan four and one-half inch mesh. In addition, in order to obtain meaningfulresults in comparing the relative effectiveness of gear regulations totrip limits, the applicant requested that the EFP waive current trip poundagelimits and groundfish quota restrictions for vessels engaged in experimentalfishing under the permit. A notice acknowledging receipt of the application,describing the proposal, and requesting public comment was published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4> on April 5, 1989 (54 FR 13731). No written commentswere received. The application was considered by the Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil, including the directors of the fishery management agencies ofWashington, Oregon, California, and Idaho, at its April, 1989 public meetingin Portland, Oregon. The Council recommended that NMFS issue an EFP, asrequested by the applicant, except that each experimental fishing tripshould be subject to the prevailing trip frequency restrictions. The NMFShas incorporated the Council recommendations in the terms and conditionsof the EFP that was issued under the provisions of 50 CFR 663.10. The EFP was issued to Dr. Ellen Pikitch, University of Washington, on May8, 1989. The EFP authorizes 50 domestic trawl vessels to engage in experimentalfishing under the direction of Dr. Pikitch, according to the terms andconditions of the permit, from June 1, 1989, through December 31, 1989,in the EEZ off the coasts of Washington, Oregon, and California. Underthe terms and conditions of the permit, an observer from the Universityof Washington must be aboard each vessel during experimental fishing andpresent during the unloading of fish taken from each experimental trip.The permitted vessels are authorized to use detachable codends of variousmesh sizes when involved in experimental fishing as directed by the permitholder. The prevailing groundfish trip poundage limitations or optimumyield (quota) closures do not apply to each experimental fishing trip;however, the prevailing trip frequency limits will apply. The permitteeis required to provide advance notification to NMFS of each departure andarrival of vessels conducting experimental fishing. The permittee plansto schedule up to 50 experimental fishing trips under the EFP. The permitteewill prepare a comprehensive report on the results of the experimentalfishery under a project supported by a Saltonstall-Kennedy grant entitled``West Coast Groundfish Mesh Size Study.''
