But John J. Phelan Jr., who steps down Dec. 31 after six yearsas NYSE chairman, called the three-year industry slump just anotherbusiness cycle and predicted the markets would be ``roaring'' againby the mid-1990s.   In an interview in his Wall Street office, Phelan also said theBig Board was on course for a plan to institute limited after-hourstrading for the first time in its 198-year-history.   He further said the often-discussed possibility of a merger withthe smaller American Stock Exchange likely will be raised again inthe future.   Phelan, 59, said he will serve on several corporate boards, headan executive education group and continue as chairman of aninternational stock exchange association. A birder, Phelan alsosaid he plans to raise money for the Audubon Society.   William H. Donaldson, a Wall Street veteran and co-founder ofthe brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc., takes over forPhelan during a bear market that shows little signs of quicklyreversing.   ``We've got problems to get over,'' Phelan said. ``We hadexcesses in the '80s. The entire country overleveraged itself, fromeach individual right up through the majority of corporations. It'sgoing to take us awhile to digest that.''   ``But I think we will do that ... without a major catastrophe,''he said. ``I think by the middle of this decade you're going tohave a roaring market again. We'll all be worried about capacityand volume again.''   After hitting an all-time high of 2,999.75 in July, the DowJones industrial average tumbled 21 percent by October beforeregaining some lost ground in the last two months.   Average daily trading volume for 1990 through November was 156.9million shares, NYSE figures show, a 5.8 percent drop from lastyear and 16.9 percent lower than 1987.   Those declines, coupled with a deepening recession on WallStreet reflected by thousands of layoffs and across-the-boardbusiness declines at major investment firms, are expected to beexaggerated by the nation's economic woes.   Asked when the market might turn around, Phelan said six to 18months.   Phelan leaves behind a legacy as a candid and forceful leader ofthe nation's No. 1 stock exchange. He is best known for safelyguiding the NYSE through the 508-point stock market crash inOctober 1987.   Phelan also presided over the greatest expansion andtechnological explosion in NYSE history. Despite the recentsell-off, volume today is 72 percent higher than in 1984 and morethan eight times higher than when he arrived as a vice chairman in1975.   Phelan's major piece of unfinished business is a five-part planfor continuous round-the-clock trading announced earlier this year.   The first step in the plan is for limited trading sessionsshortly after the market close, now expected to begin in January.Phelan said the proposal is awaiting approval by the Securities andExchange Commission.   Phelan said the initial sessions would go on despite the recentlow volume as a prelude toward more extensive trading. But Phelansaid full-scale 24-hour trading is ``a long way off.''   He was skeptical of ``this whole theory of a couch potatositting there at 2 o'clock in the morning dying to make a trade insomething. Most people don't like to trade when the home market isclosed. It's going to take a long time to change that.''   But he added: ``I think there's a good chance somewhere outthere that in certain securities there may be a continuing demandand we ought to have something out there in case the demandcomes.''   On other matters, Phelan said restrictions on computerizedprogram trading instituted this year had helped prevent volatilemovements in the market blamed for heightening investor anxiety.   Now, he said, ``everybody's invited to the party but nobody'sallowed to get drunk and disorderly.''   ``Clearly the investing public, whether it's the institutions orthe individual, plus everybody who regulates the market ... feltmore comfortable when there was no volatility,'' he said.   Phelan also said one of the NYSE's biggest weaknesses has beenits inability to market so-called derivative products such as stockand bond options.   He said the strength of the rival American Stock Exchange maylead to a renewal of talks about a merger. ``I think it issomething that will come up again,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
