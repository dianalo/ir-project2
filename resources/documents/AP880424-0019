Since Hakim has never been granted a security clearance, U.S.District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell's recent decision made clear thatfairness takes precedence over normal security rules in a criminaltrial.   The judge gave all four defendants access to 300,000 classifieddocuments to prepare for trial, although anyone in the case facesstiff penalties for unauthorized disclosure of material in thedocuments.   But Hakim's case is the best example of the problem, because hisbackground is so different from those of the other defendants.   Oliver L. North, John M. Poindexter, and Richard V. Secord allare former military men with wide experience in handling secretdocuments and covert operations.   But Hakim is a businessman of Iranian heritage, who told theIran-Contra congressional committees, ``As a businessman, I neverpretended to undertake these activities for philanthropicpurposes.''   Jerry Rubino, director of security for the Justice Department,said, ``It does present a problem whenever we can't do traditionalbackground checks'' for security clearances.   Rubino said he can't recall any previous case where such broadaccess to classified information was granted to someone without aclearance. Normally, he said, ``The indictment makes itinappropriate to say this person is trustworthy.''   The Iran-Contra indictment alleges a broad conspiracy to misusea lawful presidential order allowing the secret sales of arms toIran.   The conspirators are accused of using money from the sales toaid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was banned,to generate illegal profits for private gain, and to cover up theiractivities.   North was a National Security Council staff member; his boss wasformer national security adviser Poindexter; Secord is a former AirForce major general turned private businessman and Hakim wasSecord's business partner.   As an NSC staffer, North generated many of the classifiedIran-Contra documents that he will see in the case; so didPoindexter, who routinely briefed the president on nationalsecurity matters and therefore had vast knowledge of the nation'ssecrets.   Secord, who became North's key private sector operative, hadheld sensitive Pentagon jobs. He once was in charge ofinternational security matters and reportedly helped plan anunexecuted Pentagon mission to Iran in 1980, when 52 Americans wereheld hostage at the U.S. embassy there.   E. Lawrence Barcella Jr., a former assistant U.S. attorney inWashington who specialized in anti-terrorism prosecutions, saidReagan administration officials ``probably are very edgy aboutletting Hakim see it (the classified information).''   But he added, ``The problem is, that was the choice the(independent counsel) knew about before he indicted him.''   The government has decided on occasion against bringing chargesin some espionage or anti-terrorism cases so it wouldn't riskdisclosure of classified information, Barcella said.   But far worse for the government was ``graymail,'' a form ofblackmail used by those threatening to expose classifiedinformation if indicted.   Congress' answer was passage in 1980 of the ClassifiedInformation Procedures Act, which sets up rules for handlingclassified information in criminal trials.   The law allows the judge to take swift retribution againstunauthorized disclosures, by finding a violator in contempt andjailing him or her immediately.   In return for the swift contempt penalty that protects thegovernment's information, the defense is assured the access itneeds to present its side.   ``The act was structured to equalize the status of a defendantregardless of whether he has a security clearance,'' said AllanAdler, a legislative counsel of the American Civil Liberties Union.   ``No one should have an advantage. What Congress intended wasthat a criminal defendant's ... right (to a fair trial) should notbe impaired by the fact that information relating to the charges isclassified.''   The act requires the defendant to notify the court and theprosecution if it plans to use classified documents in the case.   The court has discretion to work out alternative procedures thatcould keep the documents secret, while allowing the trial tocontinue.   For instance, there could be a government statement admittingrelevant facts that the specific classified information would tendto prove. There could be a summary of the information.   And if a defendant is prevented by the judge from usingclassified information he needs for his defense, the court hasthree choices: it can dismiss the indictment in whole or in part,strike certain prosecution testimony, or rule against theprosecution on any issue where the information would be relevant.</TEXT></DOC>
