Botha todayextended the national state of emergency for a fourth year in a bidto quell further black unrest and maintain a clampdown on oppositionpolitical groups.   Despite a sharp decline in political violence during the pastyear, Botha said black revolutionaries are still plotting toundermine his white-led government.   ``By applying the emergency measures, the government succeeded instopping the widespread violence by radicals,'' Botha said.   However, Botha said in his statement that revolutionaries are``continuing underground to mobilize and to exert their influence''and ``unrest-related violence is still unacceptably high.''   Anti-apartheid groups said Botha's decision would furtherpolarize the deeply divided country.   ``The apartheid policy is so acutely unacceptable to the majorityof the people of South Africa that apartheid government can bemaintained only by force,'' said Zach de Beer, the white leader ofthe anti-apartheid Democratic Party.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 28 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.   ``The reimposition of the emergency will be a recipe forconflict,'' the mostly black Congress of South African Trade Unions,the country's largest labor federation, said in a statement.   The government proclamation formally extending the emergency madeno changes to the existing regulations. The wide-rangingrestrictions make it illegal to call for boycotts or foreignsanctions, to seek to undermine the security forces, or to report onpolice activity or unrest without permission. Most forms of peacefulprotest also are banned.   A senior police official, Gen. Johan van der Merwe, told a newsbriefing that all 32 organizations banned the past three years wouldremain restricted.   He also said restrictions including house arrest, prohibitions onthe right to work, speak publicly, participate in politicalactivity, or travel would be reimposed on about 500 people.   About 30,000 people, almost all of them black, have been detainedwithout charge for varying lengths of time during the emergency,although fewer than 100 currently are being held now.   After a hunger strike among detainees this year, hundreds werefreed but restrictions were placed on their activities.   Van der Merwe said one of the main reasons for continuing thestate of emergency was ``indications'' the September parliamentaryelections would be the target of ``terrorist actions.'' Parliamenthas chambers for whites, Asians and people of mixed race but norepresentation for the black majority.   F.W. de Klerk, leader of the governing National Party and Botha'sdesignated successor, said he supported the renewal of the state ofemergency. The National Party is viewed as virtually certain to winthe September elections, and Botha has indicated he will step downat that time.   When he imposed the national state of emergency on June 12, 1986,Botha said the normal law of the land was inadequate to maintainorder at a time when protests, mob violence, clashes between policeand black township residents spread across the country.   The violence, which took at least 3,000 lives, almost all black,has dropped dramatically.   The only major ongoing conflict is in the townships around Durbanand Pietermaritzburg, two southeastern cities where rival blackgroups are locked in a bitter power struggle.   Elsewhere today, a limpet mine exploded at a deserted muncipaloffice building in Soweto, the huge township outside Johannesburg.It was the 24th bombing this year, but no one has been killed in anyof the attacks.   There have been nearly 200 bombings, injuring 680 people andkilling 35, during the state of emergency.</TEXT></DOC>
