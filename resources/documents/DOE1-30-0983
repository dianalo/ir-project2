In addition to these, the specifiedresearch and the research based on the science and technology promotioncoordination expense were carried out. Research was advanced by the collective-disciplinemethod, and good results were obtained. Much of this is due to the effortsof Administration Division, Technical Division, and Hospital Division,as well as Research Division. The total number of trainees who finishedvarious courses reached 3651 in fiscal year 1985, and this contributedlargely to the protection from and the utilization of radiation in Japan.Recently, the importance of international exchange has increased, andefforts have been exerted to take part in various international activitiesovercoming all difficulties.</TEXT></DOC>
