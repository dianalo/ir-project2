Edgar D. Landis, senior vice president, finance, for the management-recruiting and technical-services concern, projected earnings for the quarter ending Oct. 31 of more than $2.5 million, or 41 cents a share, compared with $1.5 million, or 25 cents a share, on revenue of $116.4 million. Year-earlier results are adjusted for a 3-for-2 stock split paid in August 1987.    For the year-earlier six months, the company reported net income of $3.4 million, or 84 cents a share, on revenue of $230.7 million.    Mr. Landis used the latest fiscal first-quarter earnings of $2.5 million, or 41 cents a share, as the base of his forecast. Revenue in that period was $138.5 million.    Several elements of the CDI automotive engineering operation have recovered from last year's downturn, Mr. Landis said, and CDI also has several broaderscope projects under way.    But Mr. Landis cautioned that the company still is encountering unexpected &quot;rough bumps&quot; in its automotive-prototype business. For example, first-quarter gains in automotive product and manufacturing engineering were offset by a &quot;sharp decline&quot; in automotive prototyping, caused by weaker demand and price cutting, he said. Automotive prototyping involves the early stages of the styling process for new car models, using clay mockups and applying digitized technology.    &quot;We're showing some improvements, and we're in a good trend, but we aren't entirely out of the woods yet,&quot; he said.    Growth in CDI's other technical-service market, which includes applications for aerospace, electronics and marine engineering, is slow because of tighter defense spending. About a third of CDI's technicalservices revenue comes from the U.S. government and prime defense contractors.    Meanwhile, CDI's temporary-clerical business continues to grow rapidly. CDI had 90 offices for temporaries opened at Sept. 30, compared with 72 a year earlier. By April 30, he said, the company plans to have 100 to 120 offices.    CDI's long-term debt, which totaled about $27 million at Sept. 30, is expected to &quot;decline to the low 20s&quot; by the end of this fiscal year, Mr. Landis said. </TEXT></DOC>
