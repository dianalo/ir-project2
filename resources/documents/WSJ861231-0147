Consequently, he argues, they enjoy a significantly lower cost of capital than U.S. firms. He believes that U.S. firms are afraid to violate arbitrary rules-of-thumb regarding acceptable debt/equity ratios because they fear bond downgradings and the resulting fall in share prices. Thus the ethos of American business -- maximization of shareholder wealth -- puts it at a disadvantage to foreign firms that have longer-term goals of growth.    However, Germans perceive their industry as seriously undercapitalized. German tax law virtually forces firms to distribute earnings to shareholders rather than retain them to build equity. A major goal of Germany's tax-reform legislation is to encourage reduced business dependence on debt. In Japan, close cooperation among banks, businesses and government distorts free-market capital requirements. Even so, increased capital requirements for banks are being proposed in Japan.    Mr. Ellsworth's claim that U.S. firms' cost of capital in 1981 was 16.6%, compared with about 9% for their highly levered Japanese and German counterparts, is extremely misleading because his figures don't account for differences in inflation. At the beginning of 1981 U.S. investors would have been perfectly reasonable to demand a return eight percentage points higher than German investors, since the U.S. inflation rate in 1980 was that much higher than Germany's. The stated difference in the costs of capital could thus be explained entirely by differences in inflation, without recourse to Mr. Ellsworth's capital-structure argument. Similarly, U.S. inflation was 5.5 percentage points higher in 1980 than that in Japan.    Finally, Mr. Ellsworth underestimates the significance of the fact that rules-of-thumb about debt/equity ratios are based on the accumulated experience that debt increases risk, an experience that is being reaffirmed today. FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman has called the growth of debt in the U.S. &quot;way too steep,&quot; and with good reason: The recent growth of debt in all sectors of the economy to historically high levels has been accompanied by sharp increases in uncollectible credit-card balances, mortgage foreclosures, loan charge-offs and corporate-bond downgradings. The FDIC has found that increases in corporate-debt burden are a statistically significant contributor to bank failures. The most vivid illustration of the danger of borrowing in anticipation of future income is the current difficulties of the farm and energy sectors of our economy.    Forsaking prudence in the control of debt is not going to improve our international competitive position. It would merely increase the threat to the stability of the financial system that the current high levels of debt have already created.    David C.
