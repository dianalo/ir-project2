(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Kraft Inc., determined to retain itsindependence or drive up the price of any takeover, has told hostilesuitor Philip Morris Cos. Inc. it would negotiate only if PhilipMorris raised its $90 a share takeover bid to more than $110 a share.   In a strongly worded letter Tuesday, Kraft Chairman and ChiefExecutive Officer John Richman said his company was determined topush ahead with a defensive recapitalization plan that it proposedwhen Kraft rejected Philip Morris' $11 billion buyout offer.   ``The recapitalization plan will take place only if ourshareholders approve it,'' said Richman in a letter to HamishMaxwell, his counterpart at Philip Morris.   ``Kraft will not pressure its shareholders, nor will Kraft permityou to stampede them,'' said Richman.   Kraft stock, which soared $10 a share on Monday, closed down $3 ashare at $99 Tuesday in active New York Stock Exchange trading.   Kraft contends the recapitalization announced Sunday would payshareholders more than $110 a share in cash and securities.   The suburban Chicago-based company has acknowledged that interestand principal payments for such a program are estimated at more than$12.4 billion. And analysts say Kraft _ maker of Velveeta cheese,Sealtest ice creams and a raft of other fresh and frozen foodproducts _ would increase its debt tenfold to finance the plan, andwould be forced to sell some operations to pay for it.   Even so, Richman indicated Kraft will not be pressured intoaccepting terms its board considers inadequate.   ``Kraft was not `for sale' and is not `for sale.' There is noauction of Kraft ... If Philip Morris or another company trulywishes to negotiate with Kraft, a simple phone call proposing (thesweetened price) is all that is necessary,'' said Richman.   New York-based Philip Morris's response suggested that callwouldn't be forthcoming soon.   ``Everybody from the market itself to arbitrageurs to people whohave evaluated the matter have questioned whether theirrecapitalization is worth anywhere near $110,'' a spokesman forPhilip Morris who refused to be named said Tuesday.   ``As for the letter, we're evaluating our options,'' he said.``And at the moment, we have nothing more to say about it.''   Both the market and some analysts reacted unfavorably.   ``Quite frankly, Philip Morris' offer looked like a pretty goodbeginning,'' said John Maxwell Jr., who tracks the food industry forWheat First Securities Inc. of Richmond, Va.   ``While I thought Kraft might get a few dollars more, at $90 ashare, the (first takeover) offer was already about 15 for 16 timesthe earnings for 1988 _ a pretty good premium.''   John Bierbusse, analyst with A.G. Edwards andamp; Sons in St. Louis,said the letter contained nothing new.   ``Obviously, Kraft felt some need to clarify the position itexpressed with the recapitalization. But I think it's safe to callthe $110 figure overvalued.''   Kraft already has been restructuring for several years to shedits non-food operations.</TEXT></DOC>
