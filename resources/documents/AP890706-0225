The $600 million undertaking is the largest single financingproject in the United States in the independent power andcogeneration field, Westinghouse said Wednesday. Chase ManhattanBank of New York structured and underwrote the financing, andsyndicated it to a group of 10 banks.   Last year, Chase structured, underwrote and arranged twocomparable financings for a combined total of $675 million to buildtwo power plants in the Southwest for Texas-New Mexico Power Co.Chase also worked with Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse on that project.   Westinghouse will manage the latest project to completion,including the design, construction, testing and startup of the twocombined-cycle plants in Bellingham, Mass., and Sayreville, N.J.   The 300-megawatt, natural gas-fired power plants will be built onparallel construction schedules. Commercial operation is expected tobegin in 1991.   Westinghouse will manage the operation of both plants under10-year contracts.   Power generated by the Bellingham station will be bought byBoston Edison Co, Montaup Electric Co. and Commonwealth Electric Co.The plant will provide process steam to an adjacent carbon dioxideproduction facility.   Jersey Central Power andamp; Light will buy all power generated by theSayreville facility. The plant will supply process steam to HerculesInc.   ``As the nation acts to meet its future energy needs, theconstruction and financing of projects like Intercontinental willassume increasing importance,'' said William D. Rockford, Chase'smanaging director for project finance. ``Chase stands ready to workwith the energy industry to further the effort.''   Intercontinental is a project developer owned by the Roy familyof Massachusetts.</TEXT></DOC>
