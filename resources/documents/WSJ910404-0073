Grace andamp; Co. said the U.S. Patent Officegranted the company's Agracetus unit a patent coveringprocedures for genetically engineering cotton plants.   The specialty-chemical concern said the patent covers botha method for inserting genetic material into cotton plants,and any plant varieties developed with the method.</LP><TEXT>   The technology was central to the Agracetus unit's 1987development of the first cotton plants to contain foreigngenes, Grace said, and to the subsequent first-ever fieldtest of insect-resistant cotton in 1989. The &quot;encouraging&quot;results of those tests, Grace said, led the company todevelop a second generation of such plants.   &quot;To date,&quot; Grace said, the method to which it has receiveda patent -- which involves insertion of a natural plantbacteria into cotton plants -- has been the &quot;only practicalcotton transformation method available.&quot;   Insect-resistant cotton strains, which hold the promise ofreduced pesticide use by farmers, aren't yet in commercialuse. But Grace said it expects to be selling insect-resistantcotton varieties, through planned joint ventures with seedcompanies, &quot;within a few years.&quot;   Agracetus, Middleton, Wis., was for many years a jointventure between Grace and Cetus Corp., an Emeryville, Calif.,biotechnology company; Grace bought out Cetus's interest inearly 1990. Agracetus is also developing other strains ofbioengineered agricultural products, including soybeans.</TEXT></DOC>
