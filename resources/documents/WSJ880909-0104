Hilder (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FIN </CO><IN> BNK BON FIN </IN><TEXT>   Financial Corp. of America shares plunged in the wake of the company's announcement on Wednesday that it intends to seek protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.    Common shares of Financial Corp., of Irvine, Calif., lost about 83% of their market value yesterday, falling to 12.5 cents each, down 62.5 cents from their previous closing price of 75 cents last Friday.    The company's shares traded in the so-called third market, in which securities firms that aren't members of the New York Stock Exchange trade shares of companies that are listed on the Big Board. Financial Corp.'s shares are listed on the Big Board, but the shares haven't traded there since last Friday.    Until Tuesday morning, Financial Corp. had been the parent of American Savings andamp; Loan Association, the nation's largest insolvent thrift. On Tuesday, federal regulators seized control of American Savings as a step toward completing the acquisition of the thrift by Robert M. Bass Group, Fort Worth, Texas, with $2 billion in federal aid.    Financial Corp. said on Wednesday that it expects to file for Chapter 11 protection sometime this week. As of late yesterday, the company hadn't made its filing. Under Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditor lawsuits while it devises a plan to pay debt. Analysts said, however, Financial Corp. may end up in a Chapter 7 liquidation proceeding rather than a reorganization.    Now that Financial Corp. has been stripped of American Savings, it has essentially no operating businesses, few assets, and massive liabilities. As of June 30, the company's liabilities exceeded its assets by $387 million. The parent's liquid assets were only about $3.3 million in cash and investment securities.    Financial Corp.'s only other significant asset was a $65 million note to American Savings, which is unlikely to be repaid, since Financial Corp. also owes American Savings about $135 million. Financial Corp. also has about $78 million in subordinated debentures outstanding.    Separately, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. said it lowered its rating on Financial Corp.'s subordinated debt and income debentures to D from single-C. The issues also were removed from Sandamp;P's CreditWatch list of ratings subject to a possible downgrade.    Sandamp;P also changed its CreditWatch designation for American Savings' certificates of deposit from &quot;developing&quot; to &quot;positive,&quot; in light of the expected acquisition by Bass Group. </TEXT></DOC>
