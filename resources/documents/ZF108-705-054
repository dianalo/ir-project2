Coates Inc., a leadingfuture planning advocate, located here in Washington to explore theapplication opportunities for this information tech- nology in the emergingelectronic and photonic world.andP;  In defining the parameters of the study, wemutually chose the year 2005 as the target year.andM;Although this may appear to be a long time in the future, it was based on themutual recognition that research and development has a long maturation time;consequently, business opportunities 15-20 years in the future areappropriate for initiating research projects today.andM;Although the study confirmed that the markets and impact of the emerginginformation and communication infrastructure is large, with manyopportunities for all stake holders who are willing to participate, there areother points from this study that are relevant to today's hearing.andM;-- Emerging information technologies will at least initially seem complex tothe user.andP;  Accordingly, the user's focus must be on un- derstanding how toutilize the technology, not the technical details.andP;  The technology must betransparent to the user.andM;This leaves the manufacturers and service providers with the responsibilityto understand its use, operations, and benefits.andP;  Consequently, in at leastthe early stages of its introduction, the manufacturer and supplier must playdominate roles in educat- ing and training would-be users.andM;-- In the broadest terms, all major, systemic, powerful or in- fluentialtechnologies undergo three stages in their introduction and use.andP;  The firstphase is always a direct substitution to provide some clear and unequivocalmicroeconomic benefit.andM;A second phase occurs -- sometimes almost simultaneously, some- times monthsto years later -- in which it is realized that the new technology offersfurther microeconomic benefits by reorganiz- ing the flow of goods ormaterials or the arrangements of people and equipment.andP;  The radical new usesof technology occur in the third stage when technology is cheap, familiar,commonplace, well understood and widely available.andM;These points highlight the need for close working relationships between endusers, service providers, research and development or- ganizations andmanufacturers.andP;  In addition, a long period of time elapses before realizationof the dramatic new uses that may be the target and justification for initialRandamp;D expenditures.andM;Northern Telecom believes that the manufacturing restriction should berelaxed to allow the RBOCs to participate in the risk associated with Randamp;Dinvestment as well as participate in the definition of applications with theend user, Randamp;D and manufactur- ing team.andM;This will optimize innovation, advance the timeliness of innova- tivesolutions, and facilitate the iterative communication process.andM;It has long been assumed that product innovations are typically developed byproduct manufacturers; this assumption has had a major impact oninnovation-related research, a firm's management of research and developmentand on government innovation policy.andM;Eric von Hippel is Professor of Management of Technology at the Sloan Schoolof Management, Massachusetts, Institute of Technol- ogy.andP;  With his students,he has spent 12 years studying where in- novation occurs in various marketsthroughout the world.andP;  His studies, in contrast with the above assumptions,have revealed that innovation can occur any place in the supply process andis distributed across users, manufacturers, suppliers, and others.andM;Innovation is maximized when all participants work as a team.andP;  NorthernTelecom supports these conclusions and believes that the currentmanufacturing restriction prevents effective management of innovation withinthe domestic telecommunications infrastructure that is essential to assureits deployment both as a productivity tool and for the development ofproducts that enhance competitive- ness in world markets.andM;In a study of Randamp;D expenditures conducted by SRI International and publishedin late 1987,  &quot;Quality in Randamp;D -- Managing Creativity for CompetitiveLeadership,&quot; SRI identified that of the $53 bil- lion spent for Randamp;D by U.S.andO;businesses in 1986, 30-50 percent sup- ported work that failed due to lack ofmarket focus or poor Randamp;D control.andM;Further, market needs rather than scientific or technical advances stimulated60-80 percent of successful innovations.andP;  Their recom- mendations to increasemarket focus and control included:andM;-- Aggressively pursuing partnerships with leading edge customers;andM;-- Protytping to encourage interactions with distributors and end users; andandM;-- Improving marketing/Randamp;D linkage and marketing control of Randamp;D directions.andM;The current manufacturing restriction does not permit manufac- turers to workeffectively with RBOCs and end users in a team relationship, and excludes amarket commitment by major dis- tributors (RBOCs) as part of the Randamp;Dinvestment measures used by manufacturers.andM;Northern Telecom supports the removal of the existing MFJ manufacturingprohibition.andP;  In particular, Northern Telecom believes that allowing theRegional Bell Operating Companies to participate in the design anddevelopment of new services, tech- nologies and products could significantlyspur innovation and ex- pand the resources available to develop new productsand features for the nation's telecommunications infrastructure.andM;Thus, greater participation by the RBOCs in the manufacturing process couldoffer substantial and meaningful benefits for the participants within theinformation industry, the American con- sumer and the nation as a whole.andM;RBOC funding of new product development can play a vital role in encouragingmanufacturers that are confronted with finite amounts of human and financialresources to share the financial risks as- sociated with competitive markets.andO;In addition, RBOC participa- tion during these states is essential due totoday's technologi- cally complex and increasingly integratedtelecommunications net- work infrastructure.andM;Their participation would not only preserve and enhance the quality of thenetwork, but also ensure a more timely and economi- cal deployment of thesenew services, technologies and products.andP;  Furthermore, recognition of theiterative process between end users, service providers, manufacturers, andRandamp;D organizations can encourage and stimulate domestic manufacturing with areward of early cost effective product availability for both domestic andinternational markets.andM;Northern Telecom believes that if the RBOCs continue to be barred from allaspects of design and development activities, the infor- mation industries'manufacturing process will become increasingly inefficient, the rate offailure of research and development projects will escalate, product launcheswill be slowed due to the inability to do product development and servicedefinition in parallel and manufacturers will be discouraged from pursuingmore innovative but potentially higher risk technologies and products.andM;The manufacturing prohibition also has the potential to impede United Statescompetitiveness in the evolving telecommunications network infrastructure.andO;Northern Telecom believes the prohibition no longer takes into account recentchanges in the product development process.andM;For example, the telecommunications design and development process is nowmuch less predictable and is a considerably more customized process.andO;Furthermore, there is less and less of a distinction be- tween genericrequirements (a permitted RBOC activity) and product specifications (aprohibited RBOC activity).andM;As a result, the manufacturing prohibition has significantly reduced theintegration between manufacturers and the RBOCs while also depriving bothparties of critical information.andP;  Conse- quently, this has made themanufacturing process less efficient and more expensive, along withinhibiting productive innovation by both the RBOCs and manufacturers.andM;RBOCs participation would permit new services, technologies and products tobe deployed on a more timely and economical basis.andP;  Also, the RBOCs' humanand financial resources would enhance ongo- ing and future research anddevelopment along with the implementa- tion of intelligent networktechnologies.andP;  Thus RBOC participation would benefit the informationindustry, consumers and this country's overall competitiveness.andM;For the record, Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit a copy of NorthernTelecom's &quot;Response To Request For Comments On Issues Relating To TheDomestic Telecommunications Infracstructure,&quot; dated April 9, 1990, inresponse to the National Telecommunica- tions and Information AdministrationDocket No.andP;  9126-9296.andM;I believe the Subcommittee will find it useful as an expansion on the views Ihave presented here with respect to the exciting fu- ture fortelecommunications, the role of the RBOCs in manufactur- ing, andopportunities to further the U.S.andP;  economy in a worldwide market.andM;We thank you for soliciting our views.andP;  We congragulate you and the membersof the Subcommittee and your staffs on your efforts to deal with theseissues, and would welcome an opportunity to work with you on this importanttask.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
