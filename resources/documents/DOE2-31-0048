The author comments on positive applications of geneticengineering such as the hardening of species threatened with extinctionand biodegradation of industrial wastes. However, he warns that the biologists'ability to manipulate an organism's genome has exceeded the knowledgeof the ecology of those species. Schemes to exploit agriculturally marginalhabitats may have severe ecological consequences such as changes in communitystructure. Engineering the organism for a specific function would ensurethe ability of the organism to carry out its intended function withoutnegative impact on the environment. Genetic engineering promises to bean important component of a larger, integrated approach towards stoppingthe deterioration of the global ecosystem.</TEXT></DOC>
