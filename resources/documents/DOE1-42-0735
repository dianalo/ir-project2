The WNP-2 computer system evolution is characterizedby a greater than normal amount of utility involvement in the designand definition steps of the system development. A large fraction of theapplications software has been internally developed with significantsegments making extended use of EPRI technology. The WNP-2 system evolutionis also atypical, in that standard system products from a wide varietyof vendors have been integrated into the overall system. This paper discussesthe evolutionary steps in a chronological manner - providing a historicalperspective regarding what hardware and software was acquired, when,from whom and why. WNP-2 has recently awarded a contract for the laststage of this overall system development (the plant process computerreplacement) - this system will permit the eventual replacement of theoriginal PPC (a late 1960's vintage conventional process computer) witha modern, compact, and very powerful system which embodies a substantialamount of high speed data acquisition technology developed in recentyears for use in the aerospace and military fields. The capabilitiesof this new system go far beyond what has been conventional for nuclearpower plant applications - for example their new system, by using a standardhardware preprocessor, will have the capability to acquire an engineeringunit database at rates exceeding 100,000 points per second directly intothe DEC/VAX main memory.</TEXT></DOC>
