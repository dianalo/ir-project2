The current economic, trade and military sanctions expire onApril 8. Bush was expected to act as early as today or Friday tokeep them in place for year.   In the package that is currently being prepared for Bush'ssignature, the sanctions remain the same as the ones already inplace.   ``After the election we'll take a look at the situation thereand see if there's any cause for change,'' said the source, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   The sanctions imposed under executive order by Reagan a year agoinvolve restrictions on U.S. businesses who have developed aflourishing business with Panama, as well as a cutoff of militaryaid to the Central American nation.   The sanctions include blocking assets of the government ofPanama in the United States and prohibiting tax payments by U.S.organizations to the Noriega regime.   The administration is closely looking to Panama's upcomingelections which are scheduled for May 7.   It is anticipated that Noriega, who is accused in a federal drugrunning case in Miami, will control the process because he controlsthe electoral tribunal and the media that otherwise might provideopposition candidates a better chance to get their messages out.   Noriega as chief of the Defense Forces is de facto ruler ofPanama.   ``If the Panamanian people have a chance to express their willin a free and open manner, we're confident Noriega will go,'' saidthe source, who acknowledged however, that prospects for thatappeared rocky.   The military promised the opposition Authentic Panamanian Partythat the elections will be clean.   The Democratic Alliance, a coalition of the oppositionDemocratic Christian, Liberal and Liberal Republican NationalistMovement parties, has Guillermo Endara as its presidentialcandidate.   Noriega has been Panama's de facto leader since February 1988,when he orchestrated the ouster of President Eric Arturo Delvalle.The president had tried to fire Noriega as military leader afterNoriega was indicted in Florida on U.S. drug trafficking charges.Noriega denied the charges.   Washington continues to recognize Delvalle as president andimposed economic sanctions against Panama in an effort to forceNoriega out.</TEXT></DOC>
