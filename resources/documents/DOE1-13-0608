The fiber, which is referred to as PRD-166,has a tensile strength of over 2100 MPa at 380 GPa modulus. After exposureto 1400 C in air for 100 h, the retained room tensile strength is over1400 MPa and the modulus remains at 380 GPa. The development of thismaterial was the result of an effort to produce a high-strength oxideceramic fiber suitable for reinforcement of metal, glass, and ceramicmatrix composites. Most currently available oxide fibers suffer severeloss of properties when exposed to the fabrication conditions of thesecomposites. This paper reviews the mechanical, chemical, and thermalproperties of the new fiber, as well as the mechanisms for strength retention.</TEXT></DOC>
