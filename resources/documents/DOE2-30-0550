MARKAL ia a techno-economic model sinceits data base is mainly composed of technical coefficients describinginputs and outputs of a very large set of technologies, including theirefficiencies, their costs (investment and operation, fixed and variable),their lifetime, their dates of availability, and residual capacity. Themodel presents an overview of what changes might occur within an industry(such as penetration rates of new processes, impacts on energy consumption)in response to changes outside the industry (such as end-product demand,fuel prices, new alternative technologies). It gives a description ofthe age structure of all capital equipment which therefore allows themodel to capture possible implementation dates of new technologies. And,it provides the first elements of a techno-economic data base for theindustrial sector which can be basis of further developments. 21 refs.,11 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
