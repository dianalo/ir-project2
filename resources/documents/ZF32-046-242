(correction to 'The basic building blocks' inAugust, 1991 issue) (Correction Notice)andM;</TITLE><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>By sorting, editing, and polishing thousands of product listings sent fromhundreds of corporations, the LAN Magazine editors brought you an almostperfect August Buyers Guide.andP;  But between blurry fax pages, missing surveys,and human error, we discovered a few mistakes.andP;  Please note the followingcorrections:andM;DATABILITYandM;The new address for Datability, a manufacturer of communications servers andterminal servers, is 1 Palmer Terrace, Carlstadt, NJ 07072, telephone (20438-2400, and fax (201) 438-2688.andM;DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP. (DEC)andM;The eight-slot DEChub 90 backplane, listed in the &quot;Wiring Hub&quot;  section ofNetwork Hardware, enables other work-group repeater, bridge, andterminal-server modules to be networked via one module.andP;  The DECrepeater 90Tis an eight-port Ethernet repeater that supports UTP.andP;  The DECrepeater 90Csupports thin-coax cabling.andP;  Both repeaters can function as stand-alone unitsor snap into a DEChub 90.andP;  DEChub 90 costs $890; the DECrepeater 90T andDECrepeater 90C cost  1,590 each.andM;Due to incorrect information on its survey, DEC would like to make thefollowing clarifications.andP;  The DECbridge 90, listed in the &quot;Bridges&quot; sectionof Internetworking, costs $2,890.andP;  The LAN Bridge 150 and the LAN Bridge 200do not support SNMP, and only the LAN Bridge 200 has customized filtering.andO;Also, the DECbridge 500 and 600 series support IEEE spanning tree, whichprohibits load balancing.andM;IMC NETWORKSandM;The following IMC Networks products were inadvertently omitted from &quot;WiringHubs&quot; in Network Hardware:andM;The TP Hub is an Ethernet hub that supports UTP, thin coax, and thin coax.andO;It has eight UTP slots, one AUI slot, and one BNC  slot.andP;  It costs $795.andM;The PCnic Basket Plus is an Ethernet hub that supports UTP, fiber, thin coax,and thick coax.andP;  The hub has six slots.andP;  The UTP and coax cards have 2 ports;the fiber card has one.andP;  The base configuration (which includes one AUI andone BNC port) costs $995; the BNC card costs $450; the twisted-pair cardcosts  190; and the fiber-optic card sells for  495.andM;The LANspan/NBP is a NetBIOS interface software package that offersconcurrent  operation  of  NetWare, TCP/IP, and NetBIOS-based networkoperating systems.andP;  It supports LAN Manager, NetBIOS, NetWare, VINES, TCP/IP,WEB NOS, LANtastic, and ReadyLink.andP;  It costs $50 for a single-LAN sitelicense.andM;NETWORK PRODUCTSandM;Network Products' ACS[.sup.2andrsqb; COMM  server, listed in the Internetworkingsection, uses the NCSI asynchronous communications protocol.andM;SCHNEIDER AND KOCHandM;Schneider and Koch's FDDI cards, listed in the Network Hardware category,were incorrectly identified.andP;  The correct product names are SK-NET FDDI ClassA and SK-NET FDDI Class B.andM;SPIDER SYSTEMSandM;Spider Systems' Spider Analyzer, listed under &quot;Protocol Analyzers&quot; in NetworkManagement, is SNMP compatible.andM;The Spider Probe is a protocol analyzer that supports LAN Manager, NetBIOS,NetWare, VINES, DECnet, ISO, XNS, SNA, TCP/IP, AppleTalk, NetBEUI, Ethernet,and Token Ring.andP;  The Spider Probe is a multisegment local or remote LANmonitoring and analysis device.andP;  It ranges in price from  3,450 to $4,950.andM;THOMAS-CONRADandM;Thomas-Conrad's TC5055, listed under the &quot;Wiring Hubs&quot; section of NetworkHardware, provides eight UTP port connections.andM;WORDPERFECTandM;WordPerfect Office, listed under the &quot;Workgroup Software&quot; section in NetworkSoftware, costs  495 for a five-user license and $1,495 for a 20-userlicense.andP;  (Tucson, AZ) or Wellfleet (Bedford, MA) now any stronger or betterbuys than they were before the two companies went public this summer? Theanswer is &quot;yes&quot; and  no.&quot;andM;The 1POs give Artisoft and Well-fleet capital for expansion, product researchand development, and marketing.andP;  In particular, spending money on Randamp;D canimprove product offerings.andP;  But having more money to spend doesn't guaranteea better product.andP;  Nor does it mean a particular product will fill the needsof any group of users, either.andM;Artisoft, which develops and markets the LANtastic NOS as well as a line ofEthernet hardware, plans to use the proceeds from its five-million share IPOfor &quot;working capital and general corporate purposes,&quot; it said in a preparedstatement.andM;Wellfleet sold 3.5 million shares at $17 a share in its August IPO.andP;  It nowappears to possess the resources it needs to compete on a somewhat equalbasis with router market leader cisco Systems (Menlo Park, CA) in theinternetworking marketplace.andM;Cisco is an excellent example of a company that &quot;leveraged&quot; a public offeringinto success.andP;  It was only after it went public in February 1990, that salesof its already popular bridges and routers really took off.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
