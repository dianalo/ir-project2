Law forbids men from shaving, and many ultra-Orthodox men growfull beards and wear side curls.   But traditional gas masks won't seal properly over facial hairand the issue had caused great anxiety among Israel'sultra-Orthodox community until Thursday's ruling by Chief RabbiMordechai Eliyahu.   The government has considered distributing masks because ofthreats by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to attack the Jewishstate with chemical weapons. Private sales of masks have boomed.   The religious weekly Yom Hashishi on Thursday suggestedultra-Orthodox men consider acquiring gas masks designed forchildren because they cover the entire head.   But the Civil Defense agency, responsible for procuring anddistributing gas masks, has said catering to the needs of beardedmen would not be possible because the masks are mass-produced.   In his ruling, Eliyahu said that although Jewish traditionalways spoke of Jewish men wearing beards, there was no prohibitionagainst shaving in the body of Jewish law.   ``Bearded men have to shave off their beards before wearing agas mask since even a two-day beard prevents the mask from sealingproperly and may allow the gas to penetrate inside,'' he said.   Eliyahu also said bearded men should carry scissors in theirpocket in case they need to shave in a hurry, the national Itimnews agency reported.</TEXT></DOC>
