In a case where a supersonic detector was applied to diagnosisof the bearings of a turning motor, the shock pulse value started toincrease gradually following the detection of abnormal sound, and reacheda damage level in four months. In a case where a frequency analyzer wasadded for diagnosis of the bearing of a fan, specific peaks characteristicof damages to the bearings appeared at various frequencies over the entirefrequency range. Application of a frequency analyzer to the analysisof resonant vibrations of a pump successfully detected resonance resultingfrom the coincidence of the frequency of natural vibration caused byexcitation test with that of vibration of the pump in operation. In acase where a supersonic detector was applied to diagnosis of leak fromthe tube of a high-pressure water supply system, four-month measurementshowed that the shock pulse value became more than three times as highas normal, indicating leak from the tube. In another case of leak diagnosis,damage in a valve was identified from measurements made by a leak monitor.(22 figs, 4 tabs, 3 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
