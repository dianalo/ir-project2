A communique said the strikers were coldand hungry but wouldn't give up the fight.   Three members of the strike committee, church-appointed mediatorTadeusz Mazowiecki, and an unspecified number of managementofficials were there, said the source, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The source spoke at St. Brygida's Church, a stronghold of thebanned Solidarity trade union federation that is near shipyard. Hesaid no other details were available.   It was the first such meeting since the strike for higher payand legalization of Solidarity began Monday in the worst wave oflabor upheaval in Poland since the 1981 military crackdown.   Riot police surrounded the yard Thursday, prompting fears thatthey would storm the shipyard like they did the Nowa Huta steelmill in Krakow three days ago.   Today those fears diminished, according to a strikers'communique issued from the shipyard.      ``The shipyard is still isolated from the city, but there is nofeeling of siege,'' the communique said. ``And the ZOMOs (riotpolice) are in fact invisible except for the third gate and therailway gate where police vehicles are parked nearby.''   Veteran dissident Adam Michnik said the government wouldprobably not raid the Gdansk shipyard, where the Solidarity tradeunion federation was started in 1980.   ``It seems they are going to use a different scenario than inNowa Huta,'' he said. ``They probably want to take the shipyard byhunger.''   Food has been choked off since Thursday, and the strikers wereable to share only sauerkraut soup Friday. It was not known whatthey would eat today.   The Polish government continued to crack down hard on unionactivists, sentencing several to prison terms.   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, the national spokesman for the Solidaritytrade union federation, was sentenced to six weeks in prison inconnection with interviews he gave to Western media, according toWarsaw opposition spokesman Ewa Milewicz.   In Gdansk, Czeslaw Nowak, a Solidarity dockworker activist, wassentenced to three months. On Friday, Bogdan Lis, regional head ofSolidarity in Gdansk, was given a three-month term for calling anillegal strike.   The sentences were the harshest imposed on Solidarity activistsfor union activities since a 1986 political amnesty.   At least seven other activists were reported detained.   In addition, a draft of a bill, obtained by Western newsagencies in Warsaw, indicated the Polish government might toughenanti-strike laws as a means of countering labor unrest.   Polish authorities say the strikes are undermining plans toreform the economy.   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski told a bankers' groupthat certain groups were using the nation's economic difficultiesas an excuse to fight socialism. But he acknowledged that someelements of the economic reform hadn't been effective enough.   The strikers' communique said three members of the strikecommittee met with the bishop of Gdansk, Tadeusz Goclowski, at 8p.m. Friday and again with a church representative this morning.   The communique said a priest from Goclowski's curia was allowedinto the shipyard and celebrated Mass for the strikers Fridayevening. A source said one topic of the talks with Goclowski was toarrange a big shipyard Mass on Sunday.   The strikers' ``main problem'' was lack of food, cigarettes,hygiene and ``bad weather,'' the communique said.   The communique made no mention of a suicide attempt Friday byone young striker. After the attempt, Solidarity leader Lech Walesagave a morale-building talk and the strikers took steps to organizethemselves more effectively.   Strike sources said Walesa told an unidentified deputy managerthat the workers, given the opportunity to run the yardsthemselves, could save the shipyard's economic situation.   The deputy manager echoed government concern that the shipyardswere on the verge of bankruptcy.   Strikers reportedly laughed down a suggestion by the deputymanager that they accept a small raise, the sources said. Strikersalso are demanding legalization of the local chapter of theindependent trade union Solidarity, freedom for political prisonersand reinstatement of fired workers.   The recent wave of labor unrest began April 25 with a successfulone-day stoppage by transit workers in the northwestern city ofBydgoszcz. The workers won a 60 percent raise.   Prices in Poland have risen 42 percent price so far this year aspart of the government's austerity program.   No disturbances were reported Friday in the southern city ofKrakow, where riot police on Thursday crushed a 10-day strike atthe Nowa Huta steel mill.   Poland's Roman Catholic bishops denounced the police action.   Solidarity, the only independent union federation everofficially recognized in the Soviet bloc, was chartered by thegovernment in the fall of 1980 during strikes across the country.   It was suspended in December 1981.</TEXT></DOC>
