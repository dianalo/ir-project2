For Merrill Lynch, stock research has been a top prestige area since the 1970s, when Donald Regan, then chairman, set out to recruit top analysts. Merrill's equity team for years has topped Institutional Investor magazine's rankings. And in good times, top stock research departments can play a big indirect role in attracting trading commissions and investment banking revenue for Wall Street firms.    But &quot;when business dries up, you're forced to cut costs,&quot; says Robert Errigo, until recently Merrill's director of U.S. stock research. Analysts say the firm's research unit was &quot;hit&quot; Jan. 6, losing 10 U.S. stock analysts. Since then, says an analyst, firings have been rolling through successive units in Merrill's New York headquarters.    As previously reported, Merrill has said company-wide layoffs could reach 2,000 to 3,000 by Jan. 31. Merrill's big global research unit previously had about 125 U.S. equity analysts -- some of whom figured their department would be exempt from cuts.    But recent Merrill cutbacks include Edmund Greenslet, senior airline analyst; Wayne Whipple, oil services; Joseph Garcia, natural gas; and Victor Tom, Kenneth Lucas and John Hayward, special situations.    Recently, Merrill airline analyst Betsy Snyder returned from a Christmas break to learn that she was part of planned cuts. In shock, Ms. Snyder was dispatched to Merrill's human resources department and outplacement agency, Drake Beam Morin, colleagues say.    &quot;We've had tears, we've had everything&quot; from displaced analysts, says Grant Tompkins, a senior Drake executive. Some analysts will take months to find new jobs because of overall retrenchment on Wall Street, he says.    There have been research cuts recently at other big Wall Street firms, including Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. and the new company resulting from the Shearson Lehman Brothers-E.F. Hutton merger.    Some money managers think such cuts may signal doubts about maintaining expensive research services in hard times. If cutbacks continue, there might be less timely information on stocks they buy, investors say.    Perrin Long, an analyst at Lipper Analytical Securities Corp., says the cost of sustaining Merrill's 125 U.S. stock analysts might have run to $35 million a year, before bonuses. In boom times, he says, the analysts might indirectly generate four times that in trading commissions and investment banking revenue. Of course, trading and banking units are also costly to maintain. In a bad year, Mr. Long adds, analysts might not cover their expenses.    &quot;If we're in a bear market, I would expect more cutbacks&quot; in Wall Street research, he says.    One Merrill analyst says the average analyst's salary is about $100,000 to $200,000 before bonuses. Her bonus in 1986, a good year, was &quot;over 100%&quot; of her salary, she adds. Merrill won't comment on pay formulas.    Jack Lavery, head of Merrill's global research unit and director of corporate strategy, says, &quot;We are not retreating in our research focus.&quot; To fill voids in stock research, he says, Merrill recently hired Hans Plickert, airlines, and John Henry, chemicals, two casualties of the recent Shearson-Hutton merger.    Andrew Melnick, a former executive at Woolcott andamp; Co. and L.F. Rothschild, has joined Merrill as U.S. stock-research director, Mr. Lavery adds. According to Merrill analysts, Mr. Errigo, who was research director for six years, completed the unpleasant task of laying off analysts only to learn he would be replaced by Mr. Melnick. Mr. Errigo currently is working on corporate strategy for Merrill, under Mr. Lavery, as well as on some research functions.    Mr. Errigo says he was &quot;happy to accept a new challenge.&quot; He says he knew the change was coming before the layoffs. &quot;The research business is like a baseball team,&quot; he adds. &quot;The manager doesn't last but most of the players are still there.&quot;    For some ousted Merrill analysts, there were severance payments and promised bonuses, the latter to be paid soon. One analyst with five years' tenure got severance payments equal to 13 weeks of salary and also hopes for a decent bonus. Analysts with more seniority got severance payments equal to four or more weeks of salary for every year.    But bonuses were based on performance, Mr. Errigo says. And for some Merrill analysts, &quot;the compensation packages were much more generous than ours,&quot; gripes an analyst recently fired from another Wall Street firm. His severance payment consisted of seven weeks of salary for almost two years employment at the firm, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
