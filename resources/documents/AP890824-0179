Council President Louis Antoine Auguste said the government hasnot allocated a budget to the nine-member board, which was appointedin April by institutions such as the Roman Catholic Church, laborunions and human rights groups.   ``For budgetary reasons, elections before the end of December arenot feasible,'' Auguste told 150 people meeting Tuesday at the cityhall in Jacmel, a town on the southern coast of this Caribbeannation of 6 million.   The council has toured rural Haiti since July and expects to fixan election schedule by next week.   Council members are asking voters whether they think national andlocal elections should be staggered or held simultaneously andwhether 1 million Haitians living abroad should be allowed toparticipate.   ``We are trying to set an example of democratic behavior,'' saidthe council's general secretary, Jean-Gerard Pierre.   ``The citizens of certain remote areas were surprised that wefelt obligated to take account of their point of view. Haitians arenot used to being consulted by authorities,'' he said.   Jacmel residents preferred elections in two stages, firstnational and then local, begining early next year. They stronglyfavored the participation of Haitians living abroad.   Former ruler Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy dissolved the first electoralcouncil in November 1987, hours after gunmen protected by soldiersmassacred at least 34 voters at polling stations and aborted whatwould have been Haiti's first free general elections sinceindependence in 1804.   Namphy accused the council of being manipulated by ``foreignpowers.'' The United States, France and Canada contributed most ofits budget.   He was ousted in a September 1988 coup that brought Lt. Gen.Prosper Avril to power. Namphy had led a provisional governmentafter dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled to exile in France in 1986.</TEXT></DOC>
