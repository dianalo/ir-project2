Interrupting a sermon on the evils of a nearby flea market, the evangelist offers the audience a deal: a special blessing and a shred of his handkerchief in return for donations of $100. It is a limited, one-time offer. &quot;Only 40 can get in on this,&quot; he says. &quot;Not 41.&quot;    Considering that many of his followers appear impoverished, the evangelist's faith in their resources at first seems stretched. Yet, prompted by an initial &quot;gift&quot; by one of Mr. Whittington's employees, 39 other donors quickly come forward. The blessing is sold out.    Like many minor-league evangelists, Mr. Whittington is a modern-day anachronism. Scratching away in the sawdust-trail tradition of Elmer Gantry, Sinclair Lewis's worldly preacher of 60 years ago, he and others like him crisscross the nation, offering their followers solace but also a chance to become a little poorer.    Far from the glow of religious television, these lesser lights are a hidden industry, individually taking in as much as tens of millions of dollars a year, though cynicism has spread deep into their flock because of the sex scandals of their TV brethren. Their pitch is as refined as a mass-merchandiser's. Mr. Whittington, for one, blends carnival with the aura of a star on tour: advertising on television, warming up the crowd with singers, and peddling his own recorded hymns and autographed photos. His annual income, based on figures he supplied, is about $1 million.    A number of these minor-league evangelists employ bizarre and sometimes questionable business practices. Mr. Whittington, who is fond of big diamond rings, asks for donations in letters saying that some of those who oppose his ministry die. The return rate on his requests, he says, is up to 12%, four times higher than that of most mail-order retailers.    Then there are Frances Hunter, a faith-healer whose sales pitch includes the claim that God implanted her with a new heart, pancreas and thyroid; Willard Fuller, who claims his touch fills teeth with gold; Al Wyrick, who requests $40 in return for a sacred sock and his prayers to end money woes; and John &quot;3:16&quot; Cook, who proffers an alcoholic &quot;Holy Water&quot; to skid-row disciples.    Few of them are ordained ministers or affiliated with any formal religious organization. But as absurd as their methods might seem to some, they are very successful in their own way. Several evangelists say they number more than 1,000, and they estimate that they collectively have a following in the millions.    Their flocks consist largely of people who want to believe in things outside the boundaries of society's conventional wisdom. They &quot;fit right in with astrology, professional wrestling and supermarket tabloids,&quot; says David E. Harrell Jr., a University of Alabama historian of religion.    In the world of these evangelists, nothing is too wacky. Mr. Whittington says he will enter a closet to pray for those who give him exactly $33 -- a buck for each year Jesus lived on earth.    Frances Hunter and her husband, Charles, claim that their touch can cure everything from bed-wetting to whiplash. Promoting themselves as &quot;The Happy Hunters,&quot; they traveled through 25 states last year, and they estimate they collected $3.5 million from believers who filled plastic buckets instead of offering plates and who bought stacks of inspirational books and tapes.    The money supports the Hunters and their expanding enterprise. They make no pretense of backing such causes as feeding Third World masses, dismissing such activities by the major denominations as fund-raising &quot;gimmicks.&quot; They refuse to put out financial statements, saying doubters would denounce such documents by &quot;reading them the way they want to.&quot;    He is 68, she is 72, and their trademark is always dressing in matching bright colors. They cheerfully concede their inability to document their faith-healing record. &quot;There isn't a documented healing in the Bible, either,&quot; Mr. Hunter insists.    But they are relentlessly methodic when twisting arms toward the offering plate. &quot;Until God gets your money, he doesn't get you,&quot; says the matronly Mrs. Hunter to a congregation of 1,000 during an appearance in Columbus, Ohio. They sometimes advertise their services as &quot;Healing Explosions,&quot; which include lessons in glossolalia, or speaking in tongues.    Mrs. Hunter says God implanted her with her new organs when she was ill in 1974. Conceding there isn't a medical proof of the phenomenon, she says, &quot;I feel sorry for the nonbelievers who can't enjoy God's miracles.&quot;    Mr. Whittington, 47, admits a taste for the finer things in this life. His father, a Pentecostal preacher from Cleveland, Tenn., was devout and poor. But the son has long craved wealth. As a fourth-grader, he borrowed the costume-diamond ring of a classmate. Today, he wears two real diamonds of more than six carats each. &quot;Liberace owned this one,&quot; he says, proudly displaying a ring.    Although he offers faith-healing, he isn't fanatical about it. &quot;I have laid hands on thousands of people. Sometimes it works and sometimes not. They shouldn't quit seeing doctors,&quot; he says.    Mr. Whittington turned to the ministry after a stint selling clothes. God's call, he says, came to him at age 20 in a flash of &quot;lights like stars&quot; on a North Carolina highway. But he shunned seminary, ordination and a local church such as his father's. &quot;I was sent by God to the world. I don't ask anyone's endorsement. Throw me into any town and I'll survive.&quot;    He says he paid cash for a big house near his Fountain of Life Inc. headquarters in Greenville, N.C. He says his Rolls-Royce, Cadillac and Lincoln are paid for, too. So are his $42,000 tent and the $350,000 customized motor home in which he is chauffeured to revivals. He bought it, he says, after he saw the O'Jays rock group riding in one. &quot;Why criticize me over a few diamonds when the streets of heaven are paved with gold?&quot; he asks.    Mr. Whittington says a typical one-week revival brings in $30,000. Even more lucrative is his 500,000-name mailing list. (Many of the people on it attended one of his revivals in the past.) He says he gets a return rate of up to 12% in letters that request donations of up to $1,000.    A typical Whittington letter begins: &quot;My Dear Friend, . . . Two of the people that raised their hand against my ministry are dead and the third one has a chronic lung disease. . . . I'm writing you because I believe you love this ministry. Don't you?&quot;    Mr. Whittington's income pays for the soul-saving efforts of his 20-employee organization. It also supports his lavish life style, although he recently was forced to sell his $200,000 speedboat. He says donations have fallen since the uproar over the TV preachers' sex scandals. Yet he is sympathetic about their fall from grace. &quot;There's a little Elmer Gantry in every preacher, always a struggle of the carnal and the spiritual.&quot;    That tussle is known only too well to John &quot;3:16&quot; Cook, based in Las Vegas. (He takes his nickname from the Bible verse that begins &quot;For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son.&quot;) Nursing a beer in a casino lounge, he recalls seven failed marriages, a mistress and an alcoholic binge that ended with his arrest in St. Petersburg, Fla., in 1978 after his Cadillac rammed a gasoline pump.    Lately, he preaches mainly in his skidrow mission. &quot;He's a true man of God,&quot; says Deborah Shelton, an unemployed waitress who, along with her two small children, depends on Mr. Cook's largess.    Others agree. In one day last March, a reporter counted $1,900 in contribution checks received by Mr. Cook. Most of his mission's food and equipment are donated. One regular expenditure is for grain alcohol, which he mixes with water, stirs with a baseball bat and serves from a bucket to grateful parishioners. &quot;Holy water,&quot; he proclaims, as they line up, some for three servings.    Asked about the ritual, Mr. Cook, 56, quotes the 31st chapter of Proverbs: &quot;Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.&quot;    In January, a bomb powerful enough to wipe out the neighborhood was found in his headquarters and confiscated by federal agents. Mr. Cook, who wears a clerical collar although he isn't ordained in any church, says he is the target of drug dealers angered at his rehabilitating their customers. Federal agents won't comment.    Mr. Cook was raised as a traveling showman by his father, a fortune-teller who called himself &quot;The Great Lucerne.&quot; The boy's part in the act was to cover himself with ashes, wait outside rented halls and pretend to be rescued from fires &quot;seen&quot; by his father.    Mr. Cook later ran the &quot;The Swamp Angel,&quot; a carnival act featuring a wizened wino painted blue with plywood gills and fins attached, waist deep in water. With the light dimmed, Mr. Cook spun his tale of finding a runaway child who survived in a swamp by eating small animals. In the &quot;feeding time&quot; finale, the wino would wildly wave a blood-spurting beheaded chicken, driving the audience to screams.    He stumbled on a new act while attending a tent revival in Oklahoma in 1968. &quot;That's when I found characters in the Bible that I could really use,&quot; he says. &quot;A sermon is a one-man play and you get all the good parts: Jesus, John the Baptist and the devil. It's better than carnivals.&quot;    Brawls often erupt in his mission's dusty yard at night. In one recently, a Cook's assistant was stabbed to death. At the funeral of the 23-year-old aide, nicknamed &quot;Six Pack,&quot; Mr. Cook poured six cans of beer into the dust.    He sermonizes: &quot;Skid row is a state of mind. It's the condition of a man's soul when he doesn't care who he hurts and he'd just as soon drink himself to death.&quot; Later, amid the smoke and clink of glasses in a cocktail lounge, he laments that fallout from the TV evangelists' scandals has hurt his donations lately. No wonder, he adds, &quot;I never met an evangelist I really believed in.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
