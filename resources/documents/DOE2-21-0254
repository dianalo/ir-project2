Decontaminationis used both to control external radiation fields as well as to minimizeloose contamination. Additional benefits invariably accrue, such as areduced number of maintenance workers required, increased productivity,and increased morale. A central technical service organization was establishedto provide decontamination recommendations, expertise, and equipmentto our station. To provide an all-around service, a variety of decontaminationtechniques have been developed. The success of the program is best demonstratedby discussion of two examples: primary heat transport system decontaminationusing the CANDECON process and steam generator channel head decontaminationusing high-pressure water jetting.</TEXT></DOC>
