BACKGROUND</ITAG>Part 968 now contains the regulations for the Public Housing ComprehensiveImprovement Assistance program (CIAP program), which applies to all publichousing, including housing owned or operated by Indian housing authorities(IHAs). The proposed rule would rename Part 968 as ``Public Housing Modernization,''and reorganize it by establishing a Subpart A, containing generally applicableprovisions; Subpart B, setting forth the current CIAP program containedin Part 968, as revised by this proposed rule, but limiting its applicabilityto PHAs that own or operate fewer than 500 units; and Subpart C, settingforth the new Comprehensive Grant program for the larger PHAs. Part 968would apply to all PHAs, except for IHAs. By separate rulemaking, HUD intendsto consolidate all public housing regulations applicable to IHA housingin 24 CFR Part 905. In connection with publication of the final regulation,HUD will make conforming changes to cross references to Part 968 that arecontained in other regulations in Chapter IX of Title 24.A number of other regulations for the public housing program that may affectthis part are at various stages of development. When this rule is publishedfor effect, it will include appropriate amendments based on these otherrulemakings.<ITAG tagnum="74">III. PROGRAM DESCRIPTION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">A. Subpart A_General Provisions Applicable to Part 968</ITAG>1. Purpose and ApplicabilitySection 968.101 would set forth general statements of purpose and applicabilityfor the revised Part 968. The purpose of the Public Housing Modernizationprogram is to provide financial assistance to PHAs to improve the physicalcondition and upgrade the management and operation of public housing projects,to assure they continue to serve lower income families. Subpart A appliesto all modernization under Part 968. Subpart B sets forth the requirementsand procedures for the CIAP program for PHAs that own or operate fewerthan 500 public housing units. Subpart C sets forth the requirements andprocedures for the new Comprehensive Grant program for PHAs that own oroperate 500 or more public housing units. For purposes of the 500 unitthreshold, units under the Turnkey III and Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunitiesprograms would be excluded, and nonviable units approved by HUD for usebecause no alternative housing is available would be included.Part 968 applies to PHA-owned public housing (including Lanham Act andPublic Works Administration projects) and to Section 23 Leased HousingBond-Financed projects. It does not apply to projects under the Section23 Leased Housing Non-Bond Financed or Section 10(c) Leased Housing programs,or to Section 23 or Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments program projects,which do not qualify as public housing and contain alternative means tofund necessary maintenance and capital improvements.2. Indian HousingThe Department is planning to consolidate all public housing regulationsfor Indian Housing in Part 905 (see proposed rule, 53 FR 24554, publishedJune 29, 1988). Accordingly, Part 968 would not apply to Indian housing.If the plan to consolidate the regulations in Part 905 does not go forwardbefore the amendments proposed in this rule to Part 968 take effect, Indianhousing will be made subject to this Part, which would be amended to takeinto account features unique to Indians, such as the Indian preference.Accordingly, persons interested in Indian Housing should comment on thisproposed regulation as well as Part 905, since comments on both will bethe basis for a Comprehensive Grant program for IHAs that own or operatea total of 500 or more public housing units under either Part 905 or Part968. HUD does not anticipate having to publish a separate proposed regulationto amend Part 905 or Part 968 for this purpose.3. DefinitionsSection 968.105 would contain certain key definitions necessary for anunderstanding of Subparts A, B, and C, including definitions of the U.S.Housing Act of 1937, ACC, CIAP program, Federal Fiscal Year, HUD, IHA,and PHA. Subparts B and C would contain their own definitions sections,and include some identical definitions to minimize the need to refer outsideof the CIAP or Comprehensive Grant Program Subpart.4. Miscellaneous Federal RequirementsSection 968.110 would contain a catalog of the principal Federal statutoryand regulatory requirements that apply to this Part, including civil rights,environmental, wage rate, and lead-based paint requirements. The lead-basedpaint requirements have been extensively revised, consistent with the finalrule published on June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20790). Paragraph (g) provides that,beginning on April 2, 1989, modernization under Part 968 will be subjectto the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition PoliciesAct of 1970, as amended by the Uniform Relocation Act Amendments of 1987,and implementing regulations. The Department of Transportation has theresponsibility for issuing government-wide regulations implementing the1987 amendments. While it is too early to say what these requirements willbe, they will represent a change in relocation policies applicable to themodernization of public housing.5. Modernization and Energy Conservation StandardsSection 968.115 would require all modernization under Part 968 to meetHUD's modernization standards and HUD's energy conservation standards forcost-effective conservation measures.6. Preemption of State Prevailing Wage RequirementsSection 968.120 would contain the provisions preempting State prevailingwage requirements that were recently published for effect. (See 53 FR 30206,August 10, 1988.) Comparable provisions for tribal law would be added toPart 905.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Subpart B_CIAP Program Simplifications</ITAG>Subpart B would set forth the regulations specifically applicable to theCIAP program. This Subpart is largely based on the existing Part 968. However,it would make a number of changes designed to simplify program administration,as described below. References are to the proposed new section designations,which are based on the numbering system in the proposed Indian rule, sothat comparable sections share the last two digits of their section number(for example, proposed andSection; 905.605, Eligible Costs, is andSection;968.205 in this proposed regulation). The following chart shows both thecurrent and proposed section numbers for the various provisions.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s25,r60,xs48</C> <H1>Proposed</H1><H1>Proposed section heading</H1><H1>Current</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">968.201<D>Purpose and applicability</D><D>968.1 and .2.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.203<D>Definitions</D><D>968.3.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.205<D>Eligible costs</D><D>968.4.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.210<D>Procedures for obtaining approval of a modernization program</D><D>968.5.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.215<D>Modernization project</D><D>968.6.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.220<D>Tenant participation</D><D>968.7.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.225<D>Homebuyer participation</D><D>968.8.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.230<D>Special requirements for homeownership projects</D><D>968.10.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.235<D>Special requirements for section 23 leased housing bond-financed projects</D><D>968.11.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.240<D>Contracting requirements</D><D>968.12.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.245<D>Fund requisitions</D><D>968.13.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.250<D>Budget revisions</D><D>968.15.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">968.255<D>Fiscal closeout of a modernization program</D><D>968.17.</D></ITAG></ITAG>1. One-Stage Application ProcessSection 968.210 would be amended to expedite and simplify the current applicationprocess by eliminating the two-part (preliminary and final) applicationprocess and requiring only one application. The Department also intendsto propose legislation to eliminate certain burdensome requirements describedbelow. Information which is now submitted with the final application wouldbe either submitted at the front-end with the application or at the timeof joint review by HUD and the PHA or eliminated as a submission requirement.These changes would streamline the modernization application and approvalprocess for smaller PHAs.While PHAs would be required to submit a more complete application upfront,the selected applications would be able to reach the implementation stagefaster. The Department invites comments on whether PHAs favor one-stageor two-stage processing. The Department also welcomes suggestions on anyother ways these regulations could be shortened and simplified.The application (andSection; 968.210(c)) would be required to contain:a. A 5-year funding request plan, which is the PHA's estimate of the comprehensivemodernization funds to be requested over a 5-year period to meet the totalphysical and management improvements needs of its projects;b. A preliminary assessment of the physical and management improvementneeds and the estimated costs of the project(s) for which the PHA is requestingmodernization in the current year;c. For each project proposed for comprehensive modernization, an identificationof and an estimate of the total costs of replacement of equipment, systems,or structural elements that would normally be replaced (assuming routineand timely maintenance is performed) over the remaining period of the ACCor during the 30-year period beginning on the date of submission of theapplication, whichever period is longer (the Department intends to proposelegislation to drop this requirement since it is not possible for PHAsto project replacement needs over a 30-year period with sufficient accuracyto make this a useful planning tool);d. A resolution by the PHA Board of Commissioners approving the applicationand containing various certifications.e. Other information required by HUD. The proposed regulation would setforth the required contents of the PHA application with less specificityin order to make it easier to make changes to these requirements by handbook.The Department intends to continue to require PHAs to submit an organizationand staffing plan and a statement on the locality's compliance with cooperationagreement.If a PHA is selected for a joint HUD/PHA review (andSection; 968.210(e)),the PHA would conduct a comprehensive assessment for each project proposedfor comprehensive modernization. The assessment would include: The currentphysical condition and the physical improvements necessary to meet thestandards, and an identification of management needs and the improvementsneeded to upgrade the management and operation of each project. The comprehensiveassessment would include a plan for making the improvements and replacementsand for meeting the needs including: (a) A project operating budget foreach 12-month period covered by the plan, excluding modernization costs;and (b) an estimate of the financial resources to be available from allsources and the amount of modernization funds to be requested for each12-month period covered by the plan. (The Department intends to proposelegislation to drop the requirements to prepare an operating budget andan estimate of available resources for each 12-month period covered bythe plan. It is not feasible for PHAs to project with sufficient accuracyto make these useful planning tools.)After HUD funding decisions, the PHA would submit an implementation schedule(andSection; 968.210(j)) for each project in the approved modernization program.2. Current Two-Stage Application Process.Currently the preliminary application contains:a. A 5-year funding request plan, which is the PHA's initial comprehensiveassessment of the modernization funds to be requested over a five-yearperiod to meet the total physical and management improvements needs ofits project; andb. An explanation of the priority order of the projects for which modernizationfunding is requested.For joint review, the PHA completes a detailed comprehensive assessmentof the total physical and management improvement needs of the projectsfor which the PHA is requesting modernization. The assessment includesthe current physical condition and the physical improvements necessaryto meet the standards, the improvements needed to upgrade the managementand operation of each project, and an identification of management needs.Currently, the final application submission contains:a. For each project, an identification of , and an estimate of the totalcost of, replacement of equipment, systems, or structural elements thatwould normally be replaced (assuming routine and timely maintenance isperformed) over the remaining period of the ACC or during the 30-year periodbeginning on the date of submission of the application, whichever periodis longer (the Department intends to propose legislation to drop this requirementsince it is not possible for PHAs to project replacement needs over a 30-yearperiod with sufficient accuracy to make this a useful planning tool);b. As part of the comprehensive assessment, a plan for making the improvementsand replacements and for meeting the needs. The plan contains: (i) A scheduleof actions to be completed over a period of not greater than 5 years fromthe date of approval of the application, within each 12-month period coveredby the plan, and which are necessary to make the physical improvementsand to upgrade the management and operation; (ii) the estimated cost ofeach action; (iii) a project operating budget for each 12-month periodcovered by the plan, excluding modernization costs; and (iv) an estimateof the financial resources to be available from all sources and the amountsof modernization funds to be requested for each 12-month period coveredby the plan (the Department intends to propose legislation to repeal therequirements to submit the information required by clauses (iii) and (iv),since it is not feasible for PHAs to project with sufficient accuracy tomake these useful planning tools);c. An organization and staffing plan;d. A PHA report on compliance by the local governing body with the termsof the cooperation agreement;e. An energy audit; andf. A resolution by the PHA Board of Commissioners approving the final applicationand containing various certifications.3 Simplification of Other RequirementsTo continue the Department's efforts to reduce burdensome program requirements,andSection;968.240(i), Management Improvements Contracts, and andSection; 968.250,Budget Revisions, would be amended to permit PHA certification of compliancefor PHAs with proven modernization capability.Section 968.240(i), Management Improvement Contracts, would be modifiedto become consistent with andSection; 968.240 (b), (e), and (g), which permiteither prior HUD approval or PHA certification of compliance, dependingon the modernization capability and past modernization performance of thePHA. Section 968.240(i) requires the PHA to comply with HUD requirementseither to (a) submit for prior HUD approval contracts for management improvements,as well as contract changes, or (b) certify that the contracts accuratelyreflect HUD-approved work, do not exceed the HUD-approved budget amount,and have received HUD clearance under previous participation procedures.Section 968.250, Budget Revisions, would be modified to become consistentwith andSection; 968.240 (b), (e), (g), and (i), which permit either priorHUD approval or PHA certification of compliance, depending on the modernizationcapability and past modernization performance of the PHA. Section 968.250would permit a PHA to comply with HUD requirements either to (a) submitthe proposed budget revision for prior HUD approval if the PHA plans todelete or substantially revise approved work items, add new work items,or incur modernization costs in excess of the approved budget amount fora work item, or (b) certify that the revisions are necessary to carry outthe approved work and do not result in the approved budget amount for anyproject being exceeded.Section 968.14, Progress Reporting, and andSection; 958.16, On-Site Inspections,of the existing regulations are not included in the proposed rule. Section968.9(i), Insurance, would also be omitted. Section 968.245, Fund Requisitions,would be made more general. HUD intends to cover these matters in programhandbooks.4. Special Purpose ModernizationThe amendments made by section 120 of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1987, amending the provisions governing special purpose modernization,will be implemented by a separate rulemaking.5. Declaration of TrustSection 968.215(c) would require a PHA to execute and file for record aDeclaration of Trust to protect the rights and interests of HUD. This iscurrently a handbook requirement that merits inclusion in the regulationsas an important legal requirement.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Subpart C_Comprehensive Grant Program</ITAG>1. Purpose_Section 968.301Subpart C would set forth the policies and procedures for the new ComprehensiveGrant program, authorized under section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937,as amended by section 119 of the Housing and Community Development Actof 1987. Under this program, PHAs that own or operate a total of 500 ormore public housing units would receive financial assistance for the modernizationof their public housing based on a formula (see paragraph C.4). Units underthe Turnkey III and Mutual Help Homeownership Opportunities programs wouldnot be counted, since homeownership units are eligible only for limitedphysical improvements.Under this program, PHAs would have much greater discretion to plan andcarry out modernization of their public housing projects. Unlike the CIAPprogram, which is a competitive application program, PHAs would receivea share of each year's available funding in accordance with an applicationformula. As a condition of receiving funding, PHAs would be required tosubmit for HUD approval a comprehensive plan setting forth all necessaryphysical and management improvements. Included in the comprehensive planwould be a five-year action plan specifying the particular activities thePHA proposes to carry out to reasonably ensure the long-term viabilityof each project at a reasonable cost. After HUD notified a PHA of the amountof funds it would be allocated for any fiscal year, the PHA would submitan annual statement of activities and expenditures, describing its plansfor the year. Thirty days after the end of each PHA's fiscal year, thePHA would submit a performance and evaluation report describing its useof assistance during the year.In administering the program, HUD is required, under section 14(e)(4)(D)of the 1937 Act, to respect the professional judgment of the administratorsof the PHA, to the greatest extent possible. Accordingly, in its reviewof the PHA's comprehensive plan, annual statement, and performance andevaluation report, HUD would generally defer to the judgment of the PHA.2. Definitions_Section 968.305Section 968.305 would set forth the definitions that would apply to theComprehensive Grant program.3. Eligible Costs_Section 968.310Section 968.310(a) would set forth the purposes for which assistance underthis program could be used, as follows:a. Activities described in the HUD-approved comprehensive plan and itsannual statement of activities and expenditures. Included in these activitiesas eligible costs are the costs of physical and management improvements,tenant moving costs, administrative costs, lead-based paint testing andabatement costs, and assistance for tenant management corporations, allof which are also eligible under the CIAP program (see andSection; 968.205).Unlike the CIAP program, management improvements undertaken under the ComprehensiveGrant program do not have to be tied to a program of planned physical improvements.A PHA may not spend more than 15 percent of its annual grant on ``softcosts'': Management improvements, administration, fees and costs, and relocationexpenses (see andSection; 968.310(c)).b. Emergency work. This category of work need not be contained in the PHA'scomprehensive plan, since by its nature it is unanticipated and it doesnot make sense to require a PHA to amend its comprehensive plan or annualstatement before it can carry out emergency work to correct conditionsthat pose an immediate threat to tenant life, health, or safety or thatis related to fire safety. However, where a PHA is aware of necessary emergencywork, it should describe it in its comprehensive plan, action plan, andannual statement.c. Funding of reserve accounts. A PHA will be responsible for planningtheir use of assistance so that they can meet future replacement and unanticipatedemergency needs. The PHA may establish reserve accounts for this purposeif it chooses. Amounts that the PHA plans to allocate to these reserveaccounts will be specified in the PHA's action plan and annual statements.HUD is still considering how best to provide for funding of these reserves.Whether they are actually funded or maintained as unfunded accounts untilthe PHA needs to draw down amounts, HUD intends to apply earned or imputedinterest to the balance so the value of the account keeps pace with costincreases.d. Preparation of the PHA's comprehensive plan (including the action planand costs related to assisting tenants to participate in the planning process);annual statement; and annual performance and evaluation report.For homeownership programs under Subpart C, as under the CIAP program underSubpart B, only work items that are not the responsibility of the homebuyerfamilies and that are related to health and safety, correction of developmentdeficiencies, physical accessibility, cost-effective energy conservation,and lead-based paint testing and abatement would be eligible for assistance.(See andSection; 968.310(b).)A PHA could not make luxury improvements to its projects, as specifiedby HUD, because of the adverse effect such improvements would have on thePHA's ability to modernize its units within a reasonable time period andbecause of long-term increased operating and maintenance costs. HUD intendsto specify in the program handbook prohibited improvements, such as pools,dwelling unit trash compactors, garbage disposals, and dishwashers, asit now does for the CIAP program. (See andSection; 968.310(d).)Section 14(f)(2)(B) of the 1987 Act provides that a PHA could use ComprehensiveGrant program assistance for special purpose needs, even if the needs arenot indicated in the PHA's comprehensive plan or annual statement. Theproposed rule would not implement this provision, since the Departmentintends to propose legislation to repeal it. Under this program, sincea PHA has even more flexibility than it would have under special purposemodernization, there is no need for this separate category of modernization.4. Allocation of Assistance_Section 968.315Section 14(k) of the 1937 Act provides that assistance shall be allocatedunder section 14 in substantial accord with the current allocation systemunder the CIAP program, until Congress establishes, by law, a revised methodfor allocating assistance under this program. HUD is required to submita report to Congress by February 5, 1989 on the need for modernizationassistance, proposed allocation alternatives, and related information.After Congress enacts a legislative formula, HUD will publish regulationsin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> for public comment.Pending enactment of an allocation method for the Comprehensive Grant program,andSection; 968.315(a) would be reserved. For purposes of this proposed rule,HUD is assuming that funds will be allocated to PHAs through a formulabased on objective factors. A full discussion of alternative methods forallocating modernizations funds under the comprehensive grant program,and HUD's recommendation for a funding method, will be included in thereport to Congress. Several provisions of section 14 of the 1937 Act areinconsistent with a formula allocation system. Therefore, they are notincluded in this proposed regulation, and, depending on the analysis andrecommendations in the report to Congress, HUD may propose amendments todelete them in connection with enactment of the funding method. These provisionsare:(a) The second sentence of section 14(e)(3)(A), which provides that theSecretary shall review the relative needs for restoring public housingshown by comprehensive plans in HUD's regional or field offices; and(b) Section 14(h), which provides that, in making assistance availableunder either the CIAP or Comprehensive Grant program, HUD shall give preferenceto PHAs that have emergency needs or have a significant number of vacantunits and that have demonstrated a capability to carry out activities proposedin their comprehensive plans. HUD intends to propose an amendment to limitthe preference to the CIAP program.PHAs should be aware, in developing their comprehensive plans and actionplans, that, while they are required to modernize to the level of the modernizationstandards required by law, and may undertake major redesign or significantproject additions, HUD does not plan to seek funding from Congress forfunds beyond those necessary to address the backlog of mandatory modernizationneeds and the accrual of mandatory modernization needs over time. Therefore,in the planning process, PHAs should be exploring with their State andlocal governments sources of funding to enable them to undertake that workwhich they have identified as desirable at their projects which is beyondthe mandatory modernization standards.No financial assistance would be allocated to a PHA from the annual appropriationfor modernization unless HUD has approved its comprehensive plan, exceptin the case of emergency work. Where a PHA needs funds to address emergencywork and does not have an appproved comprehensive plan, it would submitan annual statement and any other supporting documentation required byHUD, describing its proposed emergency work and requesting funding to carryit out. For purposes of the proposed rule, HUD expects PHAs to be ableto meet emergency needs out of their regular grant allocation, assuminga reasonable level of appropriations for the Modernization program. HUDwill address the issue of how best to fund emergency needs in the reportit will submit to Congress next year.5. Comprehensive Plans_Section 968.320HUD must approve a comprehensive plan submitted by a PHA, as a conditionfor receiving Comprehensive Grant program funding, except funding for emergencies.The plan would identify the physical and management improvements neededfor each of the PHA's projects, including estimates of the costs. It wouldinclude general strategies for addressing these needs and also highlightany special strategies, such as major redesign or partial demolition, thatare necessary to ensure the long-term viability of the projects. Accordingly,each plan would contain the following elements.a. A comprehensive assessment of the physical needs of the PHA's projectsthat are necessary to permit them to be rehabilitated to a level at leastequal to the modernization and life-cycle cost-effective energy conservationstandards, as required in andSection; 968.115. The plan must also identifythe replacement needs the PHA anticipates over the five-year term of theaction plan.b. A comprehensive assessment of management needs, so decent, safe, andsanitary living conditions will be provided.c. A demonstration that completion of the physical and management improvementswill reasonably ensure the long-term physical and social viability of eachproject at a reasonable cost. With respect to social viability, the PHAshall demonstrate that there is a realistic potential to eliminate or modifyneighborhood or environmental conditions that jeopardize the long-termsocial viability of the project or to alter the project to cope effectivelywith these conditions. The PHA shall assess problems such as high densityin the project, a concentration of assisted housing, or physical deteriorationof, the neighborhood, industrial or commercial development which jeopardizesthe suitability of the site for residential use, air pollution, and highrates of crime and vandalism. Under this viability review, reasonable costwould be defined in andSection; 968.305 as the cost (excluding the cost ofmanagement improvements, administration, architectural and engineeringfees, and other fees) of the modernization program that does not exceed62.5 percent (for a nonelevator structure) or 69 percent (for an elevatorstructure) of the total cost guidelines for a new project with the samestructure type and number and size of units in the market area. This isthe same standard used to determine whether a CIAP project is financiallyfeasible. A PHA may not use its grant for improvements to a project unlesscompletion of the improvements would reasonably ensure long-term viabilityat a reasonable cost, except in the case of emergency work. In addition,if a PHA had received assistance under Part 968 within the preceding five-yearperiod (other than for emergency work), it would demonstrate that the proposedimprovements and replacements would not duplicate work funded during thatperiod.The Department invites comments specifically on whether PHAs should havethe flexibility to spend more on a particular project than is needed toensure viability (so long as viability can be achieved within the reasonablecost limit). In other words, should a PHA have the discretion to make moreimprovements to a project than are strictly necessary to achieve viability?The proposed rule does not address this point.d. An action plan to carry out the physical and management improvementsthat the PHA determines will reasonably ensure long-term project viability,and will reasonably ensure that the PHA will meet, or make reasonable progresstowards meeting, the performance standards in andSection; 968.345 (see sectionC.10., below). The PHA develops the action plan based on estimates providedby HUD of the amount of assistance the PHA can reasonably expect to receiveover its five-year term and on PHA estimates of funds that will be availablefrom other sources, such as State and local governments. The action planspecifies, for each project, a schedule of the improvements to be completedover a period of up to five years. The action plan also includes a preliminaryestimate of the total cost of the items for each year covered by the actionplan. If all the improvements contained in the comprehensive plan cannotreasonably be scheduled to be completed in five years, the PHA must amendits action plan annually to add an additional year until all improvementsare addressed.The Department invites comments on whether PHAs should be required to amendtheir action plans annually until all work is covered, or whether the actionplan should stay in effect (if the work specified in it is carried outon schedule) for five years, at which point a new action plan coveringan additional five years of work would be prepared by the PHA and submittedto HUD for approval.PHAs are not required to address all needs identified in their comprehensiveplans within the five-year period before funding their reserve accounts.A PHA could choose, for example, to address only emergency needs at a particularproject, while discussing with the local government that actions to takewith respect to the project. In the meantime, the PHA could increase fundingof its reserve.e. A local government statement, signed by the chief executive officerof the unit of general local government, certifying that the PHA developedthe comprehensive plan in consultation with local government officialsand tenants, including at least one public hearing, that the plan is consistentwith the local government's assessment of its lower income housing needs,and that the local government will cooperate in providing tenant programsand services.f. A statement signed by the PHA director that the PHA will carry out itscomprehensive plan in accordance with title VI of the Civil Rights Actof 1964, title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, and section 504 ofthe Rehabilitation Act of 1973.g. A PHA resolution, adopted by its Board of Commissioners, approving theplan and certifying that the PHA will comply with all requirements thatapply to the program, including certain listed requirements.If a PHA had submitted a comprehensive plan for modernization (CPM) underthe CIAP program, it could convert it to a Comprehensive Grant comprehensiveplan by submitting only the changes necessary to reflect the results ofconsultations with local government officials and tenants, and to includethe additional items required by the regulations.A PHA would be required to amend its comprehensive plan (including theaction plan) as part of its annual statement or at any other time, whenthe bases for the needs assessment or other feature of the plans had substantiallychanged. As required by section 14(e)(3)(B), a PHA would have the rightto amend its comprehensive plan to extend the time for performance if HUDis unable to provide the amount of assistance set forth in the plan orhas not provided the assistance in a timely manner.6. HUD Review and Approval of Comprehensive Plan_andSection; 968.325Upon submission of a complete comprehensive plan, it would be consideredto be approved unless HUD notified the PHA in writing within 75 calendardays that it has disapproved the plan, indicating the reasons for disapprovaland the necessary modifications. As noted above, HUD is required to deferto the professional judgment of the PHA, to the maximum extent possible.Accordingly, it would approve the plan except as follows:a. HUD determines the PHA's identification of physical and management needsis plainly inconsistent with available significant facts and data. Forexample, HUD would disapprove a plan if it determined that (i) the proposedimprovements and replacements would not bring all of the PHA's projectsup to the modernization and energy conservation standards in andSection;968.115; (ii) the management and operational improvements would not addressall of the PHA's areas of deficiency; or (iii) the proposed improvementsare not related to the needs identified, such as where vacancy problemsare not addressed.b. HUD determines the action plan is plainly inappropriate to meeting theneeds identified in the comprehensive plan.c. HUD determines that the PHA has not demonstrated that completion ofthe improvements and replacements would reasonably ensure the long-termviability of one or more projects at a reasonable cost.d. HUD has evidence which tends to challenge, in a substantial manner,the local government statement or the PHA resolution.Where the PHA and HUD disagreed over a viability determination under andSection;968.325(b)(3) or other substantive matters, HUD could approve a comprehensiveplan subject to resolution of the disagreement between HUD and the PHA.7. Annual Statement of Activities and Expenditures_Section 968.330After HUD notified the PHA of the estimated amount of assistance it wouldreceive under the formula for a particular fiscal year and the PHA estimatedhow much funding will be available from other sources, such as the Stateand local governments, the PHA would be required to submit an annual statementof activities, obligations, and expenditures. The annual statement woulddescribe the activities the PHA intends to carry out for the coming year,consistent with its comprehensive plan, including its action plan. Includedin the statement would be PHA certifications that it has given tenantsaffected by it and local government officials an opportunity to reviewthe draft statement and submit comments, and that the PHA has taken tenantand local government comments into account. The annual statement wouldalso include a proposed amendment to its action plan, if necessary to maintaina current five-year plan, where not all improvements specified in the comprehensiveplan are covered by the current five-year action plan. In addition, wherethe bases for the needs assessment or other features of the comprehensiveplan substantially change, the PHA would have to propose an amendment toits comprehensive plan. The annual statement would also include a PHA resolutionapproving the annual statement and stating that the resolution and statementssubmitted with the comprehensive plan are still current.Like the comprehensive plan, an annual statement would be considered tobe aprroved unless HUD notified the PHA of disapproval within 75 calendardays. HUD would approve an annual statement, except where it is determinedto be plainly inconsistent with the comprehensive plan; HUD has evidenceto challenge, in a substantial manner, the certifications in the statement;or the proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan are not acceptablein accordance with the review standards that apply to the review of a comprehensiveplan. HUD could approve a statement with conditions.A PHA would be required to submit major changes in its annual statementto HUD for approval, except in the case of changes due to emergencies orunanticipated work discovered during rehabilitation.After HUD approved each year's annual statement, HUD and the PHA wouldenter into an ACC amendment covering that year's grant amount.8. Conduct of Modernization Activities_Section 968.335After ACC execution, the PHA would carry out its modernization programin accordance with its approved annual statement. The PHA could requisitionmodernization funds to pay for management and physical improvements andto fund its replacement reserve. The contracting requirements in Part 85,Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State,Local, and Federally Recognized Tribal Governments (see andSection; 968.115(j))would apply. At the completion of activities funded by each annual grant,the PHA would be required to comply with certain closeout requirements.9. PHA Performance and Evaluation Report_Section 968.340Within 30 days after the end of each PHA fiscal year, the PHA would submita performance and evaluation report, in the form prescribed by HUD, describingits actual use of assistance for the previous year. The report would containan assessment of the relationship of the use of funds provided under theComprehensive Grant program, as well as the use of any other funds (suchas Community Development Block Grant program assistance, State assistance,and private funding), to the needs identified in the PHA's comprehensiveplan and to the program purposes specified in andSection; 968.301(a)(1).The report would include a PHA certification that it made the draft reportavailable for review and comment by affected tenants before submissionto HUD.10. HUD Review of PHA Performance_Section 968.345a. <T3>HUD determination.</T3> At least annually, HUD would carry out suchreviews of PHA performance as may be necessary or appropriate to make thedeterminations required by this paragraph, taking into consideration allavailable evidence.i. <T3>Conformity with comprehensive plan.</T3> HUD would determine whetherthe PHA had carried out its activities under this Subpart in a timely mannerand in accordance with its comprehensive plan.(a) In making this determination, HUD would review the PHA's performanceto determine whether the modernization activities undertaken during theperiod under review conform substantially to the activities specified inthe approved annual statement, consistent with the approved comprehensiveplan. The review could include whether any activities that were undertakenwhich were not included in the approved annual statement are eligible underandSection; 968.310, are specified in the action plan, or are due to emergenciesor unanticipated work discovered during rehabilitation. HUD would alsoconsider whether the PHA received more or less funding than anticipatedwhen it developed its annual statement.(b) HUD would review a PHA's performance to determine whether the activitiescarried out comply with the requirements of the Act, including the requirementthat the work carried out meets the modernization and energy conservationstandards in andSection; 968.115, this part, and other applicable laws andregulations.ii. <T3>Continuing capacity.</T3> HUD would determine whether the PHA has acontinuing capacity to carry out its comprehensive plan in a timely manner.(a) The primary factors to be considered in arriving at a determinationthat a recipient has a continuing capacity would be those described ini. and iii., as they relate to carrying out the comprehensive plan. IfHUD determined that the PHA has carried out its activities under this Subpartin a timely manner, taking into account the level of funding available,and in accordance with its comprehensive plan and that the PHA has satisifed,or has made reasonable progress towards satisfying, the performance standardsprescribed in subparagraph (3) as they relate to activities under thisSubpart, HUD would generally consider the PHA to have a continuing capacity.(b) HUD would give particular attention to PHA efforts to accelerate theprogress of the program and to prevent the recurrence of past deficienciesor noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.iii. <T3>Reasonable progress.</T3> HUD would determine whether the PHA has satisfied,or has made reasonable progress towards satisfying, the following performancestandards:(a) With respect to the physical condition of each project, whether theprojects are in substantial compliance with the housing quality standardsin 24 CFR 882.109; and (b) With respect to the management condition of the PHA, whether:(i) Operating reserves, exclusive of tenants accounts receivable, exceeda reasonable percentage of maximum operating reserves, in accordance withHUD guidelines (30 percent is the current requirement);(ii) Operating expenses are less than or equal to income, or do not exceedincome by more than a reasonable amount, in accordance with HUD guidelines(the current requirement is that expenses must not exceed income);(iii) Annual utility consumption, as compared to the average of the previousthree years' rolling base consumption, adjusted for variances in heatingdegree days, has not increased more than a reasonable amount, in accordancewith HUD guidelines, has not changed, or has decreased (5 percent is thecurrent cap on utility increases);(iv) The PHA is a ``high occupancy'' PHA, as determined by HUD, or is meetingthe occupancy goals of a comprehensive occupancy plan approved by HUD,in accordance with andSection; 990.118 of this chapter (this is the currentrequirement);(v) Annual rent collections equal or exceed a percentage, as specifiedby HUD, of annual rents chargeable by the PHA plus rental accounts receivableas of the end of the PHA's fiscal year (90 percent is the current requirement);(vi) The annual average number of vacancy days between tenants is not morethan a reasonable number of days, as specified by HUD (30 calendar daysis the current requirement); and(vii) The PHA has inspected all of its dwelling units annually, or moreor less often, as specified by HUD, using housing quality standards asa minimum standard (the current requirement is for inspection of 100 percentof the units).In setting the management standards and making the determination of PHAperformance as measured against the standards, HUD would take into accountwhat is reasonable to expect a PHA to achieve, based on the experienceof PHAs in similar circumstances, as determined by HUD. The current standardswere developed in consultation with PHA organizations as indicators ofoverall good management performance in key aspects of PHA operations.(c) HUD would propose changes to these standards only after consultationwith PHAs and PHA organizations.b. <T3>Condition for receipt of assistance.</T3> As required by section 14(g)of the 1937 Act, no financial assistance could be made available underthis subpart unless HUD determines that the PHA has made substantial effortsto meet the objectives of the preceding year under the PHA's comprehensiveplan, or, for the first year a PHA receives assistance under this subpart,under the PHA's approved CIAP modernization program. In making this determination,HUD would take into account its determinations under 10.a., described above.c. <T3>Corrective action.</T3>i. HUD could order a PHA to take corrective action only if HUD determines:(a) The PHA has not submitted a performance and evaluation report, in accordancewith andSection; 968.340;(b) The PHA has not carried out its activities under Subpart C in a timelymanner and in accordance with its comprehensive plan;(c) The PHA does not have a continuing capacity to carry out its comprehensiveplan in a timely manner;(d) The PHA has not satisfied, or has not made reasonable progress towardssatisfying, the performance standards specified in paragraph (a)(3).(e) An audit conducted in accordance with 24 CFR Part 44 and andSection;968.110(i) reveals findings that HUD reasonably believes require correctiveaction.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note:</T4> Determinations c.i. (b), (c), and (d) are closely basedon sections 14(e)(4)(B) (i), (ii), and (iii) of the 1937 Act, with oneexception. Section 14(e)(4)(B)(iii) (item c.i.(d), above) has a secondpart requiring HUD to determine whether a PHA ``has made reasonable progressin carrying out modernization projects approved under this section.'' Thisconcept appears to be included in clause (i) of that section: ``[whetherthe PHA] has carried out its activities under this section in a timelymanner and in accordance with its comprehensive plan * * *.'' HUD invitespublic comment on whether the second part of clause (iii) should be treatedseparately in the regulations.</ITAG>ii. Where HUD determined that corrective action would be appropriate, itwould design corrective actions to prevent continuation of the deficiency,mitigate adverse effects, and prevent recurrence of the same or similardeficiencies.iii. HUD could direct a PHA to take one or more of the following correctiveactions:(a) Submit additional information concerning the operations of the PHAto determine the cause for PHA not meeting the standards in 10. a.i., ii.,and iii., above explaining steps the PHA is taking to correct the deficiencies,documenting that the activities were not inconsistent with program requirements,and demonstrating the PHA's continuing capacity to carry out the comprehensiveplan;(b) Submit schedules for completing the work and to report on its progress;(c) Correct deficiencies specified in a letter advising the PHA if thedeficiency and warning it that HUD will impose sanctions if the deficiencyrecurs or is not corrected;(d) Submit supporting material to document one or more of the statements,resolutions, and certifications submitted by the PHA;(e) Not to incur financial obligations, or to suspend payments for oneor more activities;(f) Reimburse, from non-HUD sources, one or more program accounts for anyamounts improperly expended; and(g) Take such other corrective actions HUD determines appropriate to correctPHA deficiencies.d. <T3>Conditioning.</T3> HUD could condition approval of the next year'sannual statement, or otherwise condition a PHA's program, based on substantialevidence, in accordance with paragraph a., HUD Determination.PHAs determined by HUD to be troubled would be conditioned at the beginningof their participation in the Comprehensive Grant program. HUD will approvean annual statement on the condition that the PHA take one or more correctiveactions, such as submitting a schedule for completion of the work and reportingon its progress. The conditions would vary depending on the particularcircumstances of a troubled PHA. Troubled PHAs would continue to be conditioneduntil such time as they demonstrated compliance with program requirements. e. <T3>Withholding and Reallocating Grant Amounts.</T3> HUD would withholdsome or all of a PHA's annual grant where it has required the PHA to takecorrective action and the PHA fails to correct the deficiency within areasonable time.  In addition, where HUD has withheld a PHA's grant for two or more consecutivefiscal years, it could reallocate some or all of the amount HUD has withheldup to that time, as well as future allocations, to other PHAs in the nextFederal fiscal year. However, HUD would reallocate grant amounts only ifit has required the PHA to take corrective action and the PHA has failedto correct the deficiency within a reasonable time. Before HUD could reallocatea grant, it would notify the PHA and give it an opportunity to consultwith HUD regarding the proposed action. Where a PHA's grant funds are reallocated,a PHA could receive higher amounts in future years, but only after correctionof its deficiencies and demonstration of an ability to carry out a modernizationprogram. The required report to Congress will discuss alternative approachesfor the restoration of reallocated amounts.  Section 14 explicity authorizes HUD to withhold a PHA's grant but is silentregarding HUD's authority to reallocate withheld grant amounts. The regulationsinclude reallocation provisions because the Department believes it hasinherent authority to do so in order to make statutorily-authorized withholdinga viable sanction.  11. <T3>Transition.</T3> The Department intends to proposes a legislative proposalto permit a PHA to use any amount that HUD has obligated for it under CIAPfor the purpose for which the CIAP amount was provided, or for purposesconsistent with an action plan submitted by the PHA under the ComprehensiveGrant program, as the PHA determines to be appropriate. CIAP projects alreadyunderway would have to be completed, unless HUD authorized another useof unobligated funds. This authority would permit an orderly transitionfrom CIAP to the Comprehensive Grant program, while giving PHAs the discretionto decide the most effective and efficient way for available modernizationfunds to be spent.  <ITAG tagnum="74">IV. FINDINGS AND CERTIFICATIONS  </ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations at 24 CFR Part 50 that implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmenal Policy Act of 1969, 42 U.S.C.4332. The Finding of No Significant Impact is available for public inspectionand copying during regular business hours in the Office of the Rules DocketClerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh St. S.W., Washington, DC 20410.  This rule does not constitute a ``major rule'' as that term is definedin section 1(b) of the Executive Order on Federal Regulations issued bythe President on February 17, 1981. Analysis of the rule indicates thatit does not: (1) Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million ormore; (2) cause a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographicregions; or (3) have a significant adverse effect on competition, employment,investment, productivity, or innovation or on the ability of United States-basedenterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or exportmarkets.  The rule was listed as sequence number 1031 under the Office of Publicand Indian Housing in the Department's Semiannual Regulatory Agenda publishedon April 25, 1988 (53 FR 13854, 13892), under Executive Order 12291 andthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.  Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (the Regulatory Flexibility Act), the undersignedhereby certifies that this rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. The rule would simplify thecurrent Comprehensive Improvement Assistance program for the modernizationof public housing and establish a new Comprehensive Grant program underwhich larger PHAs would receive modernization assistance from HUD on aformula basis. HUD does not anticipate a significant economic impact onsmall entities since PHAs would continue to carry out their modernizationactivities by entering into contracts for the work as they now do. Theremay be some beneficial effects, to the extent the rule would simplify andstreamline the process.  Information collections for the CIAP program in Subpart B of this ruleare identical to or less burdensome than ones contained in the currectCIAP program requirements. The approved paperwork control numbers assignedby the Office of Management and Budget appear in the text of Subpart B. The collection of information requirements for the Comprehensive Grantprogram contined in this rule have been submitted to OMB for review undersection 3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Several sectionsof this proposed rule have been determined by the Department to containcollection of information requirements. This information is needed forHUD to administer the CIAP Comprehensive Grant programs. PHAs are the likelyrespondents.

The nature and purpose of the program wouldnot change. With respect to the Comprehensive Grant program, the new program wouldsimply provide an alternative means of funding PHAs, based on an allocationmethod to be enacted by Congress. PHAs would not longer have to competefor funding, and would be given greater discretion in carrying out theirmodernization activities. The new program is consistent with federalismprinciples since it reduces unnecessary burdens on PHAs. While it is a``new'' program, it is primarily a change only to the way HUD funds PHAmodernization activities, not to the modernization activities. In addition, since the changes are principally to the allocation systemfor providing modernization assistance and since participation by PHAsis discretionary, the rule lacks the direct and substantial effects onPHAs required for a policy with federalism implications under the Order.This rule has been developed in accordance with Executive Order 12606,The Family. It does not have potential significant impact on family formation,maintenance, or general well-being. The rule would change the applicationprocess for the CIAP program and would provide modernization funding forlarge PHAs on a formula grant basis. Families would not be affected sincePHAs would continue to carry out modernization activities at public housingprojects. The Catalog of Domestic Assistance numbers for the programs affected bythis rule are 14.850, 14.851, and 14.852.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 24 CFR Part 968 </ITAG>Loan programs: housing and community development, Public housing, Reportingand recordkeeping requirements, Grant programs: housing and community development,Indians.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, Part 968 of Title 24 of theCode of Federal Regulations is proposed to be revised to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 968_PUBLIC HOUSING MODERNIZATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.101 Purpose and applicability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.105 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.110 Other program requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.115 Modernization and energy conservation standards.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.120 Preemption of State prevailing wage requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart B_Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (For PHAs ThatOwn or Operate Fewer than 500 Public Housing Units)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.201 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.203 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.205 Eligible costs.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.210 Procedures for obtaining approval of a modernization program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.215 Modernization project.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.220 Tenant participation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.225 Homebuyer participation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.230 Special requirements for homeownership projects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.235 Special requirements for section 23 leased housing bond-financedprojects.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.240 Contracting requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.245 Fund requisitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.250 Budget revisions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.255 Fiscal closeout of a modernization program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">Subpart C_Comprehensive Grant Program (For PHAs That Own or Operate500 or More Public Housing Units)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.301 Purpose.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.305 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.310 Eligible costs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.315 Allocation of assistance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.320 Comprehensive plans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.325 HUD review and approval of comprehensive plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.330 Annual statement of activities and expenditures.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.335 Conduct of modernization activities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.340 PHA performance and evaluation report.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">968.345 HUD review of PHA performance.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Secs. 6 and 14, United States Housing Act of 1937 (42U.S.C. 1437d, 1437<T3>1</T3>); sec. 7(d), Department of Housing and Urban Development Act(42 U.S.C. 3535(d)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart A_General</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 968.101</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Purpose and applicability. </ITAG>(a) <T3>Purpose. </T3>Section 14 of the Act established the Public HousingModernization program, authorizing HUD to provide financial assistanceto public housing agencies (PHAs) to improve the physical condition andupgrade the management and operation of existing public housing projects,to assure that such projects continue to be available to serve lower incomefamilies.
