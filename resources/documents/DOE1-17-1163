Heatedacid is used in cold formations, such as cold dolomites, to increasethe rate at which the formation is dissolved, thus improving flow capacities.The new technique heats the acid by causing an exothermic chemical reactionthat uses a portion of the HCl as one of the reactants. Heated acid reactsat a faster rate and aids in the removal of acid-retarding materialssuch as oil, asphaltene and paraffins from the formation to give a betteracid-to-formation contact. Other benefits of heating acid are the preventionof organic materials from oils that have been cooled by acids, and thelimitation of the amount of tubing contraction due to temperature change.Problems presented by the slow reaction time of HCl in cold formationsand the special problems of conducting winter time acid treatments arelargely solved by heating HCl up to bottom-hole temperature or more priorto pumping. This paper presents laboratory and field results to illustratethe effectiveness of the heated acid method of stimulation and comparesthe various methods of bringing the acid to its ideal temperature. 4refs., 2 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
