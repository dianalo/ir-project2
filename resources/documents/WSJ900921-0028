The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 3/8 point, aloss of about $3.75 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount.Yesterday's decline nearly wiped out Wednesday's rally andpushed the yield on the benchmark bond back up to 9.03%.</LP><TEXT>   Bond prices were little changed during early trading butsank suddenly on news that members of Congress have beendiscussing the possibility of delaying across-the-boardspending cuts to give congressional negotiators more time towork out details of a deficit reduction plan. Unless Congresscomes up with a plan, $85 billion in automatic,across-the-board spending cuts are scheduled to go intoeffect Oct. 1. By Oct. 15, an additional $20 billion could becut.   Lawrence Leuzzi, a managing director at S.G. Warburg andamp;Co., said the reports were a big disappointment to bondinvestors, who have been counting on a quick solution to thenation's big budget deficit problem. Among other benefits, asmaller deficit would reduce the size of future governmentborrowings, which, in turn, could lead to lower interestrates.   &quot;This could be the first chink in the Gramm-Rudman armorthat could potentially lead to the unraveling of thelegislation,&quot; Mr. Leuzzi said. &quot;If they delay Gramm-Rudman afew weeks for the budget negotiations, then next they maywant to delay it until the Persian Gulf crisis is resolved.And that would be very negative for the markets.&quot;   Relentless increases in oil prices, and reports thatadditional price rises could be in store, also hurt bondprices.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, prices of the Octobercrude oil futures contract settled at $34.71 a barrel, up$1.53.   If that wasn't bad enough, the World Bank said yesterdaythat world oil prices could skyrocket as high as $65 a barrelif the Persian Gulf crisis turns into a shooting war.   Sentiment in the bond market is apparently so bearish thatnot even plunging stock prices encouraged investors to buybonds. This was surprising, considering that the bond marketoften benefits from sharp declines in stock prices, asinvestors sell stocks and invest the proceeds in Treasurysecurities, which are considered ultrasafe.   Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu, said thebond market had been anticipating some &quot;bond for stocks&quot;trading, &quot;but that never really materialized.&quot; At one point,the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 50 points, butended 39.11 points lower at 2518.32.   Mr. Fabbri said the thin trading conditions may haveoverstated yesterday's bond market decline. &quot;If more peoplewere in the market,&quot; he said, &quot;it would have been morebalanced in matching bids with offers.&quot; Mr. Fabbri said heexpects trading volume to be light again today, with fewfresh economic developments on which to focus.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities                                                                                                          Treasury securities ended moderately lower to littlechanged in light trading.   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond ended at a price of96 30/32, down from 97 9/32 on Wednesday. The issue's yield,which moves in the opposite direction of its price, rose to9.03% from 9%.   Short-term securities were little changed. The price oftwo-year notes ended at 100 3/32, to yield 8.05%, unchangedfrom Wednesday. Rates on Treasury bills were slightly higher.The discount rate on three-month Treasury bills ended at7.39%, for a bond-equivalent yield of 7.61%, and the rate onsix-month bills was 7.32%, for a bond-equivalent yield of7.69%.   The Treasury sold $10.5 billion of one-year billsyesterday at an average yield of 7.25%. That was down from7.4% at the previous one-year bill auction Aug. 23 and wasthe lowest yield since 7.21% at the Jan. 11 auction.   Here are details of yesterday's 52-week bill auction:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                                 52-Week Bills                                                                                                        Applications ......................... $32,524,150,000 Accepted at low price ................             54% Accepted noncompetitively ............    $576,095,000 Average price (Rate) .................  92.669 (7.25%) High price (Rate) ....................  92.690 (7.23%) Low price (Rate) .....................   92.669(7.25%) Coupon equivalent ....................           7.78%                                                                                                          The bills are dated Sept. 27, 1990 and mature Sept. 26,1991.                                                                                                          Junk and Corporate Bonds                                                                                                          Falling stock prices weighed on the junk-bond market,driving prices moderately lower.   But while prices of most high-yield,below-investment-grade bonds were 1/2 point lower, the junkbonds issued by casino operators posted larger declines. Thecasino-bond rout was led by Goldriver Finance Corp., whichplunged more than 30 points on news that the company won'tmeet interest due Nov. 1 on its 13.875% first mortgage bonds.The company also said it may not be able to make otherbondholder payments, as well.   That news cast a pall over the entire casino sector, whereissues such as Caesars World and Aztar Mortgage Funding Inc.registered losses of as much as one point.   Though markets for Goldriver bonds were wide, high-yieldtraders quoted the securities at bid prices ranging from 35to 39, down at least 33 points from Wednesday's closinglevels.   Meanwhile, Caesars World 13.5% subordinated notes, due in1997, slipped 1/2 point to 98 and Aztar Mortgage Funding's13.5% first mortgage bonds, maturing in 1996, fell one pointto 81.   In the high-grade market, bond prices finished unchangedto 1/8 point lower.   Among new issues, Premark International Inc. offered $100million of notes, which were priced to yield 10.502%. Thenoncallable notes were priced at a spread of 1.6 percentagepoints above the Treasury's 10-year note, throughunderwriters led by Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.                                                                                                          Municipal Bonds                                                                                                          An unexpected oil price flare-up sent municipals lowerlate in the session, with tax-exempt bonds unchanged to off1/4 point in light dealings.   A World Bank report, which estimates that the price of oilcould rise to $65 a barrel if a shooting war breaks out inthe Persian Gulf, was generally viewed as the impetus foroil's latest rise. After the report, a municipal trader said,&quot;The market's down on oil trading.&quot;   Trading remained light, as marketwary investors arecontinuing to sit on the sidelines, given the lingeringuncertainty about the Middle East. &quot;They're very careful,&quot;the trader said of investors. &quot;They're involved only if theyhave to be.&quot;   The New Jersey Turnpike Authority's 7.2% issue due 2018was 1/8 point lower at 97 to 97 3/8, to yield 7.42%.   In new-issue dealings, a Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. group setthe preliminary pricing for the Metropolitan TransportationAuthority, New York's $165.9 million transit and commuterfacilities service contract bonds, to yield from 6.4% in 1992to 8.13% in 2016. Ratings of single-A/triple-B-plus areexpected.                                                                                                          Mortgage-Backed Securities                                                                                                          Mortgage-backed securities experienced a session oflackluster trading, as many market players were absentbecause of a religious holiday.   Even though active mortgage issues traded in a tight rangefor most of the day, mortgage securities lost ground inmid-afternoon, prompted by the sharp rise in oil prices.   Mortgage issues gave up nearly 1/4 point when oil pricesshot up. Government National Mortgage Association, or GinnieMae, 9 1/2% issues for October delivery were off 5/32 at 988/32, down 7/32 from the high of 98 15/32. Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac, Gold 9 1/2% issues andFederal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, 9 1/2%issues were slightly stronger, down 4/32, at 98 25/32 and 9818/32, respectively.   In the real estate mortgage investment conduit, or remic,market, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets announced the detailsof Merrill Lynch Trust 47. The $300 million remic is backedby Ginnie Mae 9% issues and consists of nine classes.   The first two classes are sequential pay classes. Asequential pay is a series of classes whereby cash flows areused to retire each class in order of maturity. Of theremaining seven classes, five are planned amortizationclasses, or PACs. A remic is a type of security underwrittenby Wall Street firms that provides a method of dividing upthe income flows from many mortgages into new securities withvarious interest rates and maturities, to attract banks,insurers and other big investors to the home-mortgage market.   Mortgage-Treasury yield spreads were slightly narrower.Ginnie Mae 9 1/2% issues were yielding 9.91%, assuming aconstant annual prepayment rate of 5.5. The yielddifferential was 100 basis points over the 10-year Treasurynote, one basis point narrower than Wednesday. A basis pointis equal to 1/100th of one percentage point.   Freddie Mac Gold 9 1/2% issues were yielding 9.82%, basedon a constant annual prepayment rate of 6.9, and were at 90basis points over the 10-year Treasury note, three basispoints tighter than Wednesday.                                                                                                          Foreign Bonds                                                                                                          British government bonds surged in a flight-to-qualityrally that was triggered by falling stock prices.   The price of Britain's benchmark 11 3/4% government bond,or gilt, was quoted at 100 10/32, up 22/32 from lateWednesday, to yield 11.69%.   &quot;We started to take off the moment the Footsie started toplummet, with one or two people looking for a refuge,&quot; atrader said. Footsie is the sobriquet for the FinancialTimes-Stock Index of 100 issues. &quot;It's just gone up and upand up,&quot; the trader said. &quot;For every 1/2 point down in theFootsie, we're putting on a tick or two.&quot;   The bond rally began late in the day and provided someexcitement to an otherwise torpid market.   Gilt prices were slightly lower at the opening, because ofcontinued worries about delays in sterling's entry into theEuropean Exchange Rate Mechanism, following Wednesday'scomments by the West German Bundesbank, or central bank,president, Karl Otto Poehl.   In Japan, bankers and dealers warned investors to expectanother increase in Japan's long-term prime rate next week.Many analysts said the rate could rise to as high as 9%.   But bankers expressed worry that the jump to thepsychologically significant 9% level, while justified by thecosts of funds of banks, would chill demand for their loans.An official at one of Japan's three long-term credit banks,which reset the prime rate late each month, said his bank maytry to limit the rise in the long-term prime to below 9%.   The long-term prime rate is a benchmark for pricing manycorporate loans, including subordinated loans being taken byJapanese banks to raise capital, as well as housing andpersonal loans. At 9%, the prime rate would be at its highestlevel in eight years.   ---   Rose Marie Burke contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
