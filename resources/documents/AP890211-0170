ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some economists expect the nation's biggest banksto raise their prime interest rates at least once more beforespring, even though the banks have just nudged the key rate up halfa percentage point.   Major banks on Friday raised their prime rates to 11 percent from10.5 percent to keep pace with rising rates on financial markets.   It was the first increase of 1989 for the prime rate, which is abenchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumer andcorporate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages.   Friday's increase put the prime rate at its highest level sinceit reached 10.75 percent in late 1984. The last increase, from 10percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28.   Chicago-based Continental Bank and Republic National Bank of NewYork were the first to increase the prime and soon were followed byCitibank, the nation's largest bank, and other money center banks.   The increase had been widely expected by economists.   ``It was inevitable,'' said Lawrence Chimerine, chairman of WefaGroup, an economic forecasting service in Bala Cynwyd, Pa. ``Shortterm interest rates have been trending upward.''   The prime reflects a bank's costs of borrowing money, includinginterest it pays on customer accounts, short-term certificates ofdeposit and bonds, and as such mirrors rather than forecasts ratetrends.   Market rates have been rising due partly to the Federal Reserve'stightening of credit in an attempt to fight inflation.   Records released Friday indicated the Federal Open MarketCommittee, the central bank's policy-making body, decided inDecember to boost interest rates to help hold down inflation.   Short-term rates in the credit markets have risen more rapidlythan long-term rates in recent weeks. In an unusual situationearlier this week rates on short-term Treasury securities brieflywere higher than those for long-term bonds, indicating investorsbelieved the Fed was tightening credit and that inflation woulddecline in the long term.   A government report Friday on inflation worsened the outlook forinterest rates and ``was really the last straw'' for the banks, saidDavid Wyss, chief financial economist for Data Resources Inc. inLexington, Mass.   The Labor Department said its producer price index surged at anannual rate of 12.7 percent in January.   Rates rose in the credit markets after the Labor Departmentreport, as traders were convinced the jump in wholesale prices wouldforce the Fed to push interest rates even higher.   The Treasury's 30-year issue was off nearly $5.65 per each $1,000in face value in late trading. That boosted the yield on the bond _which itself is considered a barometer of rate speculation _ to 9.04percent from 8.89 percent late Thursday.   The Fed could directly drive rates upward by raising its owndiscount rate, the interest it charges on loans to commercial banks.   However, Chimerine said, the Fed governors likely would take amore indirect route, by putting further upward pressure on theso-called federal funds rate, the interest banks charge one anotherfor overnight loans.   Chimerine and Wyss anticipated there would be at least one morejump in the prime rate before spring, especially if the governmentissued more reports indicating a surging economy and soaringinflation.   Wyss predicted interest rates would peak before April or Maybecause the economy is likely to show some signs of slowing down.One reason for a slowdown would be higher interest rates, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
