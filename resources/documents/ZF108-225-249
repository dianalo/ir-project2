(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Want to gaze into the future? That's the sensation I had when I took a lookat Syscorp's MicroSTEP.andP;  It makes me wonder why I don't use a graphicalprogramming language all the time.andM;MicroSTEP 1.3 is a Computer-Aided Software Engineering  CASE.) tool thatproduces executable programs from graphic specifications.andP;  It produces andcompiles C Code and links the object files-producing a PC program and DBASE-compatible files.andP;  MicroSTEP offers an alternative to DBASE, DBASEworkalikes, and DBASE language compilers.andP;  It produces a fast EYE programfile that accesses data stored in dBASE-compatible DBF files.andP;  At $5,000,MicroSTEP may seem a bit pricey (certainly more expensive than DBASEproducts), but one Syscorp employee considers MicroSTEP's closest competitora $50,000 package running on a VAX.andM;OriginsandM;MicroSTEP, launched during COMDEX/Fall 1988, is the brainchild of Dr. RaymondYeh, founder and president of Syscorp International.andP;  With a broad and variedbackground, Yeh founded  Syscorp 1984 with a single goal: to create aparadigm supporting programmer productivity of &quot;at least an order ofmagnitude.&quot; Long before graphical user interfaces (GUIs, pronounced &quot;gooeys&quot;)and object-oriented programming (OOP) were industry buzzwords, Yeh created apackage that could create sophisticated applications without coding.andM;A major feature of Microstep its code reusability.andP;  Icons representingpredefined data structures, activities, or processes can easily be copiedfrom one application design into another.andP;  The package is alsomethodology-independent; even if you're not a database design whiz, you won'tbe forced to learn data flow diagrams, structure charts, or any otherparticular symbology to use the product.andP;  MicroSTEP is written primarily in Cwith some assembly routines.andP;  It requires a mouse, which almost entirelyreplaces traditional keyboarding.andM;Requirements and installationandM;MicroSTEP requires exactly 564K of memory.andP;  It won't run with any less.andP;  Ihad to eliminate a TSR program from my AUTOEXEC.BAT file and a device driverfrom my CONFIG.SYS file to free enough RAM to install it.andP;  Some users willprefer to decrease the FILES and/or BUFFERS statements in their CONFIG.SYSfile to save their favorite TSR.andP;  MicroSTEP also requires 5.6M of disk space.andO;Although this seems like a lot, you should realize that you're getting theLattice C compiler and PLINK86 Plus linker too.andP;  Neither the compiler norlinker is packaged as a stand-alone product; they're meant to be used only inthe MicroSTEP environment.andP;  Finally, you'll also need an EGA or VGA system aswell as a Microsoft-compatible mouse.andP;  The program supports Epson andHewlett-Packard LaserJet (and compatible) printers.andP;  MicroSTEP is distributedon six 5.25-inch high density disks (3.5-inch disks are available onrequest).andP;  I found the batch-file driven installation to be straightforward.andO;After 20 minutes, including the time to adjust my AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYSfiles and to create a batch file for MicroSTEP, I was in business.andP;  Toenhance performance, MicroSTEP automatically takes advantage of any availableextended memory.andM;Using MicroSTEPandM;So how do you use MicroSTEP? Since it's designed to generate databaseapplications, most users view MicroSTEP as a general purpose tool.andP;  It can beused to create anything from systems for managing customer calls to handlingthe &quot;heavier&quot; database chores, like implementing a medical records system.andO;Customers range from heavyweights like Chemical Bank, Peat Marwick, TRW, andPenzoil, to lone application developers.andP;  Some large MIS shops purchaseMicroSTEP for their programmers to explore CASE technology (in spite of itssteep price, it's still one of the few CASE tools available for micro work).andM;A MicroSTEP application consists of specifications, which correspond toprogram modules.andP;  Each specification consists of a flow diagram, a datastructure definition, screen and report formats, logical descriptions of theactivities within processes, and control flow between processes.andM;I admit that when I first saw the sample flow diagram shown in Fig.andP;  1, Isighed, gritted my teeth, and prepared myself for an arduous process.andP;  Afterall, I'm used to command-line interfaces.andP;  However, I was pleasantlysurprised.andP;  MicroSTEP's graphical user interface is well-implemented; thepoint-and-click approach works predictably and consistently.andP;  If you make amistake, back-ups are easy, or you can revert to the previous version of thedesign.andP;  You can save partially-completed work, exit, and return where youleft off, without losing anything-or needing a Ph.D.andM;I found the tutorial extremely well done.andP;  I must have found it useful-Ispent a day going through it.andP;  The result was a 600K EXE file containing apoint-of-sales (POS) system.andP;  The application I developed could record sales,update inventory, and print invoices or receipts, depending on whether thesale was cash or check.andP;  The inventory, customer, and transaction databasefiles appeared to be DBASE Ill PLUS and dBASE IV compatible.andM;Okay, show meandM;Think of the data flow diagram as a specification's big picture.andP;  It'screated incrementally.andP;  Fig.andP;  2 illustrates the organization of a MicroSTEPapplication.andM;Starting from scratch at the TopSTEP level, you pull down the Define menu andselect Create spec.andP;  This puts you in the Flow Diagram Builder (see Fig.andP;  3),where you grab a database file icon and give it a name.andP;  Then you define thedata structure, which can include repeating groups.andP;  Valid data types includetext, date, time, integer, long integer, real, long real, and decimal.andP;  Textfields can be as long as 254 characters, and data structures have a maximumof 1,024 characters.andP;  Any field can be a key, and previously defined fields(or groups) can be copied from one data object into another.andM;The tutorial then guides you through designing data entry forms for salesrecording-complete with look-ups and protected fields.andP;  Begin by placing ascreen activity icon on your data flow diagram, linking it to the customerand inventory database files.andP;  Then build a data structure for your screen.andO;You can do this by cloning the structures from the customer and inventoryfiles via points and clicks.andP;  Finally, enter the Screen Format Builder tocreate something like in Fig.andP;  4.andM;Screens can include pop-up windows, can be up to 130 characters wide, and canbe previewed by toggling your view to the &quot;user screen.&quot; They are not,however, saved in traditional DBASE screen file format.andM;The screen format in Fig.andP;  4, isn't quite finished.andP;  We need to set it up forlookup activities.andP;  Lookup logic is supported by a rich variety of built-infunctions and global data structures, e.g., the current date, entered fromthe keyboard or by point and click.andM;Reports are constructed much like screens, first by cloning a data structurefor the report, then laying it out.andP;  MicroSTEP reports are organized intoheaders, footers, repeating groups, and detail lines.andP;  Reports can includeboxes, lines, and so on.andP;  Output format is controlled by  pictures,&quot; familiarto DBASE and COBOL programmers.andM;The Branching logic application is selected by Define/Flow Control from theTopSTEP menu.andP;  In the tutorial application, you do this at several points-toprint either an invoice or a sales receipt.andM;AI-style error detectionandM;One of MicroSTEP's strong points is its built-in intelligence.andP;  Even thoughit still can't prevent you from making logical errors while you develop yourdesign, chances are MicroSTEP will detect errors before generating code whenyou select  Cheek Spec(s) from the Program Menu.&quot; If MicroSTEP detectsambiguity among multiple activities, problems in the order of processing, orinconsistencies in relationships among sub-specifications, it will generate aprintable  error  message  file.andP;  MicroSTEP will also flag potential problemswith warnings.andM;Although Syscorp developers are reluctant to claim that MicroSTEP uses AItechniques, it certainly has the feel of incorporated wisdom.andP;  MicroSTEPseems to act like a good assistant, thanks to intelligent defaults, humanerror messages, and fair warning when you're about to do something crucial.andO;It also gives ample opportunities to &quot;undo&quot; what you've inadvertently done.andM;Generating applicationsandM;Generating code is incredibly simple.andP;  MicroSTEP checks your specificationfor glaring errors, such as objects without data structures, processeswithout input/output, unrelated activities, or logic that includes circularreferences.andP;  Then it will generate source files, compile and link them, andbuild or rebuild the application.andM;The last step allows users to make changes and let MicroSTEP selectivelyrecompile only the code where the changes have been made.andP;  The entire processof generating my 600K POS code took about 15 minutes on a 386 clone.andP;  Ifyou're not ready to create the final application, the program lets yougenerate incomplete ones too-useful for testing your program logic.andP;  But youmay have to create temporary &quot;stub&quot; activities.andP;  Stubs are &quot;dummy&quot; processesthe application can execute until you finish the design.andP;  For example, youmight be working on an order entry/inventory updating system.andP;  If your logicrequires printing an invoice before the inventory can be updated, and youhaven't created the invoice report, you can't test the updating logic unlessyou use a placeholder routine for the invoice printing.andM;LimitsandM;How complex can an application be? Internally, MicroSTEP uses dynamic ratherthan fixed-length data structures to optimize RAM use.andP;  Ultimately, thenumber of data flow objects you can have on the screen is limited by yourdevelopment system's RAM, including extended memory.andP;  If you need to reducethe number of data-flow objects, you can create up to five levels ofsub-specification objects, corresponding to the subroutines.andO;Sub-specification objects might be used for complex updating procedures orcomplex printing tasks.andP;  MicroSTEP does, however, advise you to consider theamount of RAM required at the workstations before going hog wild withobjects.andP;  On the up side, as I've mentioned, MicroSTEP 1.3 automatically usesany available extended memory; and, according to the company, version 1.4will support expanded memory.andM;MicroSTEP process icons generally have two inputs, but processes associatedwith screen activities can have up to seven inputs to handle lookups.andO;Processes can also have up to seven outputs.andP;  Sub-specifications(subroutines) can be nested to five levels, and set up to pass or not passdata.andM;It's easy to import existing database files.andP;  As long as you can get the fileinto dBASE, fixed-length ASCII, or delimited ASCII format, you can bring itinto MicroSTEP.andM;DocumentationandM;MicroSTEP's comprehensive Reference Manual is almost 600 pages, with anexcellent 12-lesson tutorial.andP;  It also includes seven appendices with usefulinformation about data types, including external C functions in MicroSTEPprograms, printer drivers, transferring data, and so on.andP;  Although I foundthe documentation well organized and well indexed, you should take a day towork through the tutorial or attend Syscorp training.andM;On the horizonandM;MicroSTEP 1.4 should be shipping as you read this.andP;  It promises to supportNovell and IBM Token Ring network application development and up to 16M ofexpanded memory under DOS.andP;  Developers should realize that workstationsrunning MicroSTEP network applications will need more than 640K, and thatrecord locking will be limited by the DBASE file structure.andM;dBASE III PLUS allows either entire files (SET EXCLUSIVE ON) or singlerecords (RLOCKO) to be locked.andP;  In dBASE IV, additional commands areavailable to frame a transaction, so that an entire transaction either getscompleted or doesn't.andP;  Locks can be used judiciously within the transaction,and updates &quot;rolled back&quot; if necessary.andP;  This commit and rollback feature oftransaction processing is crucial when multitable updates are involved.andP;  Mostof today's database vendors are looking for methods that integrate&quot;relational&quot; locks, ones that lock one or more sets of records, or they'reimplementing &quot;page locks,&quot; which lock a memory page of records, in order toreduce I/O.andP;  Syscorp has adopted the DBASE III PLUS file structure, and thusinherited the dBASE locking mechanisms.andP;  Applications generated by MicroSTEP1.4 will provide automatic record locking wherever possible.andP;  The multiuserversion of MicroSTEP 1.4 will provide automatic protection against partialupdates, but won't support multiuser updates of repeating groups.andP;  Version1.4 will also support dynamic runtime menus, sequencing (autonumbering), andsize-selectable runtime libraries.andP;  MicroSTEP 1.4 will cost $6,000, but thatincludes training.andP;  MicroSTEP 2.0, slated for &quot;early 1990,&quot; will include ashared data dictionary and SQL support.andP;  Data dictionaries, repositories ofinformation about a database's design, are rapidly becoming a mandatoryfeature of database management systems.andP;  Syscorp is currently working onlicensing agreements with Microsoft to allow MicroSTEP to generate MicrosoftC code.andP;  The company expects to ship a Microsoft C version either as aninterim version between 1.4 and 2.0 or with 2.0.andP;  And, finally, an OS/2Presentation Manager version of MicroSTEP is currently in the prototypestage.andP;  Syscorp's long-term strategy foresees MicroSTEP applicationdevelopment on UNIX, OS/400, VMS, and MVS platforms.andM;SummaryandM;I was impressed with MicroSTEP.andP;  I only called technical support once, andfound that my problem was &quot;the one that everyone runs into.&quot; It dealt withcreating a box around a repeating group that was wider than the screen.andO;Technical support personnel quickly and courteously walked me through theproblem and took the time to explain the hows and whys.andM;It seems to me that MicroSTEP's major appeal will be to developers andsophisticated users who value a graphical programming environment with dBASEfile compatibility and/or automatic generation of C source code.andM;If you fit into this group, you should take a gaze into the future withandM;MicroSTEP.andM;Company infoandM;Syscorp provides 90 days of free technical support, and an extended supportcontract is available.andP;  It also publishes a newsletter and maintains a BBS(primarily for transferring application specifications to the technicalsupport staff).andP;  The company uses their fax machine to help debug MicroSTEP'sgraphical programming language.andP;  The Syscorp team of about 45 includesseveral trainers who give three-day classes around the country.andP;  Clients canalso arrange on-site, custom training.andP;  MicroSTEP is a product of SyscorpInternational, 9420 Research Blvd., Suite 200, Austin, Texas 78759, phone(800) 727-7837 or (512) 338-0591.andM;JARGON: CASE-What is it?andM;What is Computer-Aided Software Engineering or CASE? Is it a revolutionarytool (or toolset) that'll change the work styles of systems analysts andoffer impressive productivity gains among programmers? Will it really shortenproject development time, ease program maintenance, and foster reusable code?andO;Or is it simply the latest industry buzzword? One speaker on the subject lastyear rhetorically asked if CASE can help automate the automators.andP;  Could itreally be the &quot;silver bullet&quot; needed to slay the &quot;software monster?&quot; Or issoftware development an artform with components of &quot;sorcery andwitchcraft&quot;-ingredients that can't be automated?andM;IBM recently lent its considerable weight to the mass of vendors touting CASEtechnology for the application development life cycle.andM;Surprisingly, even defining CASE is a problem because industry insiders don'tagree on what the acronym stands for.andP;  Most say &quot;computer-aided softwareengineering,&quot; but a growing number think the  S&quot; in CASE should stand for&quot;systems.&quot;andM;CASE has evolved both from traditional systems analysis and designmethodologies, and from the emerging discipline of software engineering, soit's easy to see the reason for the confusion.andP;  Early CASE tools generallyadhered to a particular systems analysis and design methodology.andP;  These kindsof CASE products are now referred to as front-end CASE or upper CASE.andM;What's a methodology?andM;Methodologies are the sets of rules, methods, and procedures used by systemsanalysts and designers during one or more stages of the systems (or software)development life cycle.andP;  A systems development life cycle (SDLC) is usuallydepicted as moving through five stages: analyzing and defining therequirements, designing, coding, testing, and maintaining.andP;  The life cycle isusually described as linear, each phase terminating in one or more&quot;deliverables.&quot; The problem is that projects rarely move through the stageslinearly.andM;Methodologies are often named after their originators: Ward/Mellon,Yourdon/DeMarco, Gane and Sarson, Warnier/Orr, Hately, and Constantine.andP;  Ifyou haven't read a recent text on systems analysis and design, you're likelyto be bewildered by the array of choices.andP;  Some methodologies are best suitedfor data-driven systems, others for control-or event-driven systems.andP;  Theicons associated with different methodologies help distinguish them, butshouldn't be confused with the complete methodology.andP;  Because of theirgraphic orientation, most CASE tools are implemented on so-called graphicsworkstations-machines like Suns and Apollos-but more and more, we're seeingCASE tools run on PCs.andP;  Automating the process of creating complex data flowdiagrams is clearly a significant benefit of CASE.andP;  Mark Tilley, head ofSystems and Software for British Telecom Research Laboratories, oncecommented that engineers used to spend about 10 percent of their timethinking about these system flowcharts.andP;  The other 90 percent would be spentactually drawing them.andP;  And then, if changes had to be made...andM;Methodology-free systems development support toolsandM;Not all CASE tools are based on a particular methodology.andP;  However, front-endor tipper CASE tools generally include a data dictionary, diagramming tools,and a framework for systems analysis and system design.andP;  Back-end or lowerCASE tools deal more with the later stages of the life cycle.andP;  Theapplications generators and compilers that many Data Based Advisor readersuse are examples of lower CASE tools.andP;  Some of today's lower CASE toolsinclude reverse engineering abilities.andP;  These take existing COBOLapplications and transform them into data flow diagrams and data structures.andM;Roadblocks to implementationandM;Why aren't more programmers and MIS departments embracing CASE, especially ifaverage programmer productivity is really only the 10 lines of code per daywe all read about? There are probably several reasons.andP;  One is simply humanresistance to change, and it's exacerbated by the steep learning curve ofmost CASE tools.andP;  CASE technology is being adopted enthusiastically in Japan,where Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) issponsoring a five-year Sigma Project that explores its use.andP;  Europe has alsotaken to CASE enthusiastically; the European community is working on astandard called Integrated Project Support Environment (IPSE).andP;  Industryobservers are beginning to wonder if the independent streak so characteristicof U.S.andP;  programmers will kill CASE in the U.S.andM;Another roadblock is what CASE guru Ken Orr calls the &quot;guru gap&quot;-describingthe difference between industry proclamations and tangible results.andP;  Becauseof the gap, he says, many managers have unrealistic expectations about newtechniques and tools.andP;  Cost may be a factor (most CASE tools run in thethousands of dollars).andP;  Another problem is the lack of standards.andP;  Mostindustry sources expect CASE to take off in 1990, once IBM releases itsrepository, a sort of super data dictionary.andP;  IBM's repository is widelyexpected to become an instant industry standard.andM;(Figures omitted)</TEXT></DOC>
