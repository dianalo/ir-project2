Japanese music-lovers for the past decade have had thechoice of buying or renting their favorite records, with CDsadded in recent years. Currently, CDs sell for about 2,800yen ($22) and rent for about 350 yen a day, and the vastmajority of CD renters record the disks. That, U.S. recordingcompanies complain, hampers the sale of CDs. On the contrary,the 5,600 Japanese rental-shop operators say, the rentalsspur interest in music and have helped make Japan the world'ssecond biggest music market in terms of sales.</LP><TEXT>   The quarrel helped spur a change in Japanese copyrightlaw, effective Jan. 1, that will give U.S. and other foreigncompanies the right to prohibit for one year the rental oftheir CDs in Japan. But a problem with the new law hasdeveloped in recent months, prompting officials of the U.S.recording industry to come to Japan this week to try to finda compromise.   Japan is the only country where CD and record rentals havebecome a major industry. Revenue from rentals is expected toreach 80 billion yen this year, with 35% of that coming frommusic by foreign artists.   After five years of U.S. pressure, the Japanese governmentagreed in May to allow foreign record producers to prohibitrentals for a year after the work is released. Previously,only Japanese record companies had this right.   The Japanese companies, however, never fully exercisedtheir right. They don't like the rental stores and have beenbattling them in court for years. But this year, the Japaneseproducers and rental stores reached a typically Japanesecompromise in which local record producers sought to avoidcreating tension with rental stores by agreeing to a moremoderate rental ban. They agreed to a one-week ban --affecting new releases -- on rentals for 1992, lengthening tothree weeks by 1993.   The rental stores hoped that the U.S. companies wouldfollow their example. &quot;We're asking them to go with thedomestic rules and customs,&quot; says Fumio Koide, an official incharge of legal matters at the Japan Record Rental CommerceTrade Association.   But that is out of the question, says Jason Berman,president of the Recording Industry Association of America,who is in Tokyo this week to discuss the issue with theJapanese record-rental association. &quot;First, they say theygive you one year. Now, we're told that a year means a week,&quot;says Mr. Berman. &quot;It's a very curious system when you look atthe rest of the world.&quot;   Under the new law, U.S. recording companies can negotiatedirectly with Japanese rental stores about when to startpermitting U.S. works to be rented, Mr. Berman says. Thatmeans the one-year ban, in theory, could be shortened. But sofar, no U.S. makers plan to allow rentals within the year, hesays. The association mailed letters to each of Japan's CDrental-shop owners last week to remind them they need toobtain the authorization of the foreign copyright ownersstarting in the new year.   Moreover, the U.S. plans to question the legitimacy of therental business at world trade talks being held in Geneva. Inthe U.S., record producers can prohibit rentals altogether.&quot;Foreign producers and Japanese consumers who buy foreignmusic have subsidized the existence of rentals in Japan,&quot; Mr.Berman says. Japanese consumers, who account for 12% of theworld's market, are expected to buy around $800 million ofCDs by foreign artists this year.   Japanese rental-store owners say the business is legalbecause rental stores pay a fixed amount of remuneration torecord makers. &quot;We're different from companies that piratevideos,&quot; says Mr. Koide of the record-rental association.   Japanese music-rental stores are distressed by the U.S.industry's declaration. Until recently, the industry had beenquiet about its plans in regard to the May agreement; it wasonly in late October that the U.S. companies began sayingthey would exercise their right to prohibit rentals, greatlysurprising the Japanese. &quot;I'm just so mad,&quot; says KatsumasaTakada, who stocks 15,000 CDs in his rental store in thesouth of Tokyo. &quot;I was sure they would respect our customs.&quot;   Consumers are upset, too. &quot;I have so many CDs I want tolisten to that I'd go broke if I bought them all,&quot; saysHisashi Nishida, a 29-year-old worker in the fashion industrywho drops by his local CD rental shop once a week. Onaverage, he rents and tapes three CDs on each visit.   The eventual three-week compromise ban that the Japanesecompanies agreed to is actually quite effective in terms ofboosting sales, says Mr. Koide of the rental association,because the majority of people rent CDs in the first threeweeks after release and would probably buy the disks if theycan't rent them quickly.   The Japanese association plans to ask its U.S. counterpartto delay implementing the one-year ban for a few months whileboth sides seek a compromise. Meanwhile, it is nudging memberstores to collect signatures protesting the U.S. recordingcompanies' insistence on a one-year ban.   The Japanese government, which has supported the growth ofthe rental business, is watching the conflict cautiously.&quot;Most of the users of rental stores are children in secondaryschool who don't have a lot of pocket money,&quot; says anofficial at the copyrights division of Japan's CulturalAgency. &quot;There are opinions that when these people acquire anincome, they go on to purchase CDs.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
