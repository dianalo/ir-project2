<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0547 </DOCNO><TEXT>Ion beam deposition (IBD), the process whereby magnetically analyzed ionsare directly deposited on single crystal substrates, has been studiedfor /sup 74/Ge and /sup 30/Si ions on Si(100) and Ge(100). The effectsof sputter-cleaning prior to deposition and substrate temperature duringdeposition were investigated. Three analytical techniques were systematicallyused to obtain information on the deposited films: (1) Rutherford backscatteringcombined with ion channeling, (2) cross-section TEM, and (3) Seeman-BohlilnX-ray diffraction. In the energy range explored (40 - 200 eV), the widthof the interface between the IBD film and the substrate was found tobe always less than 1 nm. Each IBD layer was highly uniform in thicknessand composition for deposition temperatures from 300 K to 900 K. Withoutprior sputter-cleaning and annealing of the Si(100) and Ge(100) substrates,no epitaxy was observed. UHV conditions were found to be a requirementin order to grow crystalline Si films presenting bulk-like density. Thiswas not the case for Ge films which showed bulk-like density for IBDat higher pressures. Results on the first Si/Ge superstructure grownby IBD are also shown.</TEXT></DOC>
