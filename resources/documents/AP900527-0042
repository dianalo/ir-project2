Supporters of the National League for Democracy cheered anddanced in the streets as the first official results were announcedon state radio, giving the party victories in three of the 492races for seats in the national legislature.   The election was called by the military government, which seizedpower in September 1988 after brutally crushing a nationwidepro-democracy uprising.   The military rulers have said they will hand over power to acivilian government. But over the past 20 months the government hasimprisoned and intimidated political opponents.   Sunday's election proceeded without any reports of violence ormilitary shows of force. However, the government imposed a curfewon the capital after 10 hours of voting and four hours ofhand-counting ballots.   The early returns indicated the opposition League was winning bywide margins. In the capital's Seikan constituency, it took 60percent of the vote to 35 percent for the pro-military NationalUnity Party, official Rangoon Radio said.   The League said it was certain it had won 16 victories inRangoon's 61 constituencies. Preliminary indications from othermajor cities also suggested voters had rejected the pro-militaryparty, it said.   Results from the countryside, home to about 70 percent ofBurma's 41 million people, were less predictable. Some analystssaid the pro-military party could make a strong showing there.   A final tally could take up to three weeks, officials said.   Initial reports from polling officials indicated the turnout inmajor cities ranged from 60 percent to 70 percent.   In interviews in the capital, older Burmese generally declinedto say how they had voted, but younger voters uniformly said theyhad cast ballots for one of the pro-democracy opposition parties.   The military government has detained two leaders of the NationalLeague for Democracy. Aung San Suu Kyi, the highly popular daughterof independence hero Aung San, is under house arrest, and Tin Oo isin prison.   Former civilian Prime Minister Nu also is under house arrest.   Although the government rejected requests for foreign officialobservers at the polls, there was no sign of interference orintimidation at Rangoon voting stations visited by foreigncorrespondents.   Sources in other major cities also said there were no problems.   ``The voting went smoothly and well all over the country,''Rangoon Radio said as it announced the first official results.   ``As far as I can see, it's very fair,'' said a young womanteacher as she emerged from a polling area.   Some ethnic minority rebel and student dissident groupsboycotted Sunday's elections. However, rebel sources in Bangkoksaid on Saturday that the rebels had called off earlier plans tosabotage polling.   The 492 parliamentary seats were contested by 2,297 candidatesfrom 93 parties. Only half a dozen of the parties were expected tomake a significant showing, however.   The military government has said it will hand over power afterthe new legislature approves a constitution and new elections for acivilian government are held under the document's provisions.   Asked if he would allow a civilian government to run thecountry, junta leader Gen. Saw Maung said Sunday: ``I have alreadyabided by my promise.''   ``I will transfer power according to the law,'' he said onemerging from a central Rangoon polling booth.   Before the curfew was imposed, National League for Democracybackers celebrated their early wins at party headquarters. Peoplecheered and danced in the street in front of the rundown partybuilding.   ``I'm so happy,'' one young party member said. ``I'm notsurprised though, because we knew the people would vote for us,this is what we we expected.''   Myint U, an official of the League, said if the party won theelection, it would seek the release of political prisoners. He saidabout 400 party members were imprisoned along with other dissidents.   Many foreign human rights and legal organizations have accusedthe Rangoon leaders of widespread human rights abuses. Thegovernment has denied the allegations.   The military has held power in Burma since a 1962 coup by Gen.Ne Win, whose ``Burmese Way to Socialism'' program includedmilitary control, ruinous socialist economics and isolation fromthe rest of the world.   Although endowed with rich natural resources, Burma is now amongthe world's poorest nations.   The military rulers have liberalized the economy and expandedcommercial dealing with foreign countries while maintaining tightinternal political control.</TEXT></DOC>
