On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a last-minute buying bingedrove the June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmarkgrade of U.S. crude, to $20.93, up 33 cents from Friday's close.The June contract, which traded as low as $20.10 during thesession, expired at the close of trading.   Prices of crude oil contracts for delivery later in the yearwere down across the board.   Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for delivery in Junefell 1.29 cents to 63.90 cents a gallon, while June heating oilfell 1.08 cents to 46.98 cents a gallon. Other contracts alsoclosed the session lower.   Analysts said worries about OPEC dominated trading in the crudemarket ahead of the cartel's planned June 5 meeting.   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at EldersFutures Inc., said lower crude prices reflected concerns thatvarious members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are producing above their self-imposed output quotas.   An unconfirmed report that Kuwait would increase productionunilaterally if the cartel didn't agree to raise its target levelsparked some early selling, Beutel said.   ``The reports said that Kuwait was willing to flood the marketor increase production because it wants an increase in its quota,''he said.   Another report that Saudi Arabia would ask for a $15 a barrelfloor on crude prices at the June meeting also fueled sellingactivity, said Jim Steel, energy analyst for Refco Inc.   ``It's just pre-meeting posturing, just a negotiating tactic,''said Steel, ``but the Saudi statement moved the market.''   Energy brokers said the continued slide in gasoline futuresreflected traders' concern that the market was overbought and thatproduct inventories remained higher than last year.</TEXT></DOC>
