There have been several published analysesof the implications of the new military options provided by deep-striketechnologies. These have concentrated first and foremost on the Europeancentral front. Reportedly, NATO studies have had a similar center-firstemphasis. Although the central front is certainly crucial, it is notthe only important area for potential hostilities involving NATO. Moreover,in many ways the center is a poor proxy for other areas in terms of assessingthe potential roles and missions of deep-strike technologies. This chapterexamines the coming generation of deep-strike conventional missiles andwhat they may mean for the defense of Norway. Both technical and policyissues are addressed. Relevant systems might be based in Norway, in U.S.and allied naval ships or planes operating off the northern flank, orin the Soviet Union for use as part of their attack.</TEXT></DOC>
