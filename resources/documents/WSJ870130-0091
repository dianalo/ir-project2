The Federal Statistics Office said the trade surplus climbed to the equivalent of $6.46 billion in December from $5.72 billion in November, converting the West German mark at its current rate. The surplus exceeded the previous monthly record of $6.03 billion, set last July, and helped the 1986 surplus surge to $62.64 billion from $40.97 billion a year earlier. The final figure surpassed the preliminary estimate of a $61.55 billion 1986 surplus, released earlier in the month.    The surplus on the current account, which combines merchandise trade with trade in services as well as some unilateral transfers, narrowed to $4.75 billion in December from $5.42 billion in November, according to preliminary calculations by the central bank. In all of 1986, however, the current-account surplus widened to $43.51 billion, about double the $21.73 billion surplus in 1985.    Economists said the size of December's trade surplus surprised them. The figure is &quot;more than any of us expected,&quot; said Heinrich Ellrott, senior economist at the Rheinisch-Westfaelisches Institut Fuer Wirtschaftsforschung, or RWI, in Essen.    The increase can be traced to a sharper-than-expected drop in import prices, as well as attempts by West German exporters, especially machinery makers, to evade likely U.S. trade restrictions in 1987 by increasing their exports in December, Mr. Ellrott said.    As the mark strengthens against other currencies, German exports become more expensive and imports become cheaper. That hampers exports and encourages imports, and eventually should lead to a narrower trade surplus. But the initial effect of the increased value of exports and decreased value of imports is to actually widen the trade surplus.    However, the new data show that the trend of growing trade surpluses will end soon, economists said. Export volume stagnated in 1986, rising a meager 1.5% from 1985, mainly because of the mark's sharp appreciation against other major currencies, especially the dollar.    Many economists expect export volume to rise at an even slower pace in 1987 or to stagnate completely.    &quot;What we were seeing in December was a backlog of export goods that were ordered half a year ago,&quot; said Heinz Schrumpf, senior economist at the Institut Fuer Weltwirtschaft in Kiel. &quot;The slump in our exports will show up in the data of the next few months.&quot;    Import volume, meanwhile, climbed 6% in 1986, but an average 18.9% drop in import prices caused the value of imports to slide to $231.22 billion from $259.15 billion a year earlier, the Statistics Office said.    However, the softening of import prices should slow in coming months because of the recent success by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in stabilizing oil prices, economists said. A major part of the lower value of imports in 1986 was a 50% drop in the nation's oil bill.    Economists predicted that these trends mean that both the current-account and trade surpluses will narrow this year.    Mr. Ellrott of RWI said he expects the current-account surplus to fall to $36.30 billion and the trade surplus to narrow about 6% to $58.64 billion.    &quot;In real {volume} terms, the trade surplus has already eased for a while,&quot; he said. &quot;Now we can expect to see also nominal surpluses decline.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
