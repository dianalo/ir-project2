Edward Kennedy remarkedon the bitter aftertaste that the experience would leave withthe nominee. &quot;What if he gets on the court now?&quot; theMassachusetts Democrat asked. &quot;What will he think aboutCongress?&quot;   Yesterday evening, the Senate confirmed Judge Thomas by anarrow 52 to 48 vote -- one of the closest in the history ofthe court. After a hard-fought victory, however, anunsettling question remains: How will the excruciating ordealof the past two weeks influence Judge Thomas's legal viewsand decisions as an associate justice on the Supreme Court?</LP><TEXT>   Even if he hadn't gone through the agony of the past twoweeks, Judge Thomas would have been a crucial addition to thecourt, which is closely divided on such extraordinarilyimportant issues as abortion, religious expression, and freespeech.   But Judge Thomas's friends and foes agree that hisnationally televised trial by fire cannot fail to change himas a jurist. In his own testimony, he said an assassin'sbullet would have been preferable to the public hearings overallegations of sexual harassment. Moreover, at 43, he is arelatively young man, and his confirmation hearings suggestedthat his views on many central legal questions are in flux.This recent traumatic experience is sure to affect histhinking.   Clint Bolick, vice president of the Institute for Justicein Washington and a close friend of Judge Thomas, says thatthe weekend hearings will deepen his sympathy for victims and&quot;will reconfirm his very strong belief in individual rights.&quot;   But those who had qualms about Judge Thomas before AnitaHill's accusations against him exploded in public worry thatthe hearings will push him in a different direction. &quot;He nowsees himself as the victim of some kind of left-wingconspiracy,&quot; says Estelle Rogers, a Washington attorney. As aresult, she argues, Judge Thomas will be more likely to ruleagainst the interests of civil rights organizations andwomen's groups that opposed him.   Others are concerned that the Supreme Court as aninstitution will be diminished for having Judge Thomas on thebench, even though Prof. Hill's allegations of misconductwere not proven. Conservative legal commentator Bruce Fein,who had been a Thomas supporter, says the Senate should haverejected the nominee because &quot;the Supreme Court has got to bean institution that's above suspicion. That's why DougGinsburg was out. That's why Abe Fortas was out.&quot; (JudgeGinsburg withdrew as a nominee to the court in 1987 after itwas revealed he had smoked marijuana as a law professor;Justice Fortas resigned in 1969 in a financial scandal.)   Legal experts all along the political spectrum believe therocky confirmation hearings will influence the judge's viewson a host of issues soon to be before the court. The chargesby Prof. Hill could hardly fail to influence his thinking ona sexual harassment case that will be argued this fall. Hislingering anger toward women's groups could also affect histhoughts on abortion -- the most controversial issue beforethe court, and an issue on which Judge Thomas has said he hasno current view.   His confrontation with Congress, as Sen. Kennedy fears,could easily enough affect his view of cases involving theseparation of powers between the three branches ofgovernment. The &quot;high-tech lynching,&quot; as he called it, couldalso make him less sympathetic to a free press in FirstAmendment cases.   On the other hand, liberals hope that his experience atthe hands of the Senate will have sensitized Judge Thomas tothe rights of people charged with wrongdoing. His contentionthat he was wrongly accused could make him empathize withthose who protest their innocence.   He should be able to survive his ordeal. Judge Thomas isby no means the first Supreme Court appointee to haveweathered scandal. Others have, and then gone on todistinguished careers on the high court. Shortly afterJustice Hugo Black's confirmation in 1937, for example, itcame to light that he had been a dues-paying member of the KuKlux Klan. Justice Black withstood a storm of criticism anddemands that he resign. He disowned his racist affiliationsand went on to become an influential liberal justice.   The Thomas case, however, is unique in some respects. &quot;Wehave never had such sustained public scrutiny of suchsensitive private matters&quot; involving a Supreme Court nominee,observes Robert Katzmann, a political scientist at theBrookings Institution. The cloud over Judge Thomas isn'tlikely to dissipate quickly, especially because the Senatewas ultimately unable to determine whether he or his accuserwas telling the truth. As Judge Thomas helps decidecontroversial cases over the years, the specter of AnitaHill's lurid allegations will almost certainly be evident.Nothing, he angrily told the Judiciary Committee, &quot;can . . .give me my good name back.&quot;   Here's a look at issues on which legal experts think JudgeThomas's thinking may be affected:                                                                                                          SEXUAL HARASSMENT. The bitter battle over Judge Thomas'streatment of Anita Hill has pushed a relatively obscure casecalled Franklin vs. Gwinnett County (Ga.) into the limelightbecause it involves sexual harassment. The case, expected tobe argued before the court later this year, centers on afemale high-school student who was forced by a male coach tohave sex with him. The question is, can the student sue thecounty school system for damages under federal anti-bias law.   The slightest utterance from Judge Thomas during thisargument is bound to be dissected and will be imbued withspecial meaning. He might even be asked to recuse himselffrom the case, though it's unlikely he would do so. &quot;Peoplewill certainly be looking at how he decides the case,&quot; saysNancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the National Women's LawCenter, which has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in thecase.   Some believe that lingering bitterness over Anita Hill'scharges may prejudice him. &quot;What we've seen is that Thomaswould be biased against claims made by those trying toprotect women's rights,&quot; says Dawn Johnsen, legal director ofthe National Abortion Rights Action League.   But Ms. Campbell is hopeful that Judge Thomas will besympathetic to victims of such discrimination, in part torehabilitate his reputation. &quot;We hope this was an educationalexperience and that he'll be molded in a way to be moresensitive,&quot; she says.   Judge Thomas may get a boost in this effort from thepolitically attuned Chief Justice William Rehnquist. &quot;Iwouldn't be surprised to see the chief justice give himopinions to write on certain topics, like sex discrimination,specifically to try to dispel any bad image,&quot; says YaleKamisar, a constitutional law professor at the University ofMichigan.   During the hearing, Judge Thomas made plain his abhorrenceof sexual harassment. &quot;I have adamantly condemned sexharassment,&quot; he told the Judiciary panel. &quot;There is no memberof this committee or the Senate who feels stronger about sexharassment than I do.&quot; As chairman of the Equal EmploymentOpportunity Commission, Mr. Thomas said, he took swift actionagainst EEOC officials who were found to have engaged insexual harassment.                                                                                                          ABORTION. The issue that dominated the first round ofJudge Thomas's hearings last month, was abortion-the mostcontentious issue before the court. Democrats questionedJudge Thomas's credibility when he insisted not only that hedidn't have an opinion on Roe vs. Wade, the abortion-rightslandmark Supreme Court decision, but also that he had neverdiscussed the 1973 case.   Women's rights organizations fear that Judge Thomas'sanimosity toward liberal interest groups will influence hisdecisions on reproductive rights. Judge Thomas angrily toldthe committee that interest groups &quot;came up with this story{Hill's charges} and used this process to destroy me.&quot;Claudia Withers of the Women's Legal Defense Fund says thatsuch expressions of hostility by Judge Thomas &quot;give us theconcern that he wouldn't look favorably on claims&quot; byinterest groups that advocate abortion rights before theSupreme Court and that also opposed his nomination.   The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments today ina case involving women's ability to get court orders to breakup the sort of anti-abortion blockades that roiled Wichita,Kan., in the summer. Judge Thomas wouldn't be able to vote onthe case unless the Supreme Court asks the parties to reargueit once he is on the bench.   But a number of cases presenting an opportunity tooverrule the Roe vs. Wade decision are working their waythrough the lower courts, and the justices are expected tohear at least one of them next term. In the interveningmonths, abortion-rights advocates worry that Judge Thomas'sbitterness toward them will harden and push him into ananti-Roe majority on the court.                                                                                                          SEPARATION OF POWERS. One legal expert who knows JudgeThomas well is convinced that the new justice will be verynegative about any issue enhancing congressional powers. Evenbefore the experience of the past week, he probably wouldhave fallen under the influence of Justice Antonin Scalia, astaunch foe of expanding congressional powers. That alliancewill be fortified now.   &quot;Congress,&quot; Judge Thomas told the conservative FederalistSociety in 1988, &quot;is out of control.&quot; The Senate JudiciaryCommittee's performance can only have reinforced this lowopinion of the legislative branch. He called the hearings&quot;sick&quot; and &quot;Kafkaesque.&quot;   Judge Thomas has for a number of years allied himself withconservative legal thinkers, led by Justice Scalia, who tracemany of the government's ills to congressional overreaching.He called the 1988 Supreme Court decision on theconstitutionality of the independent counsel law &quot;the mostimportant case&quot; since Brown vs. Board of Education. JudgeThomas endorsed the lone dissenter in the case, JusticeScalia, who argued that Congress lacked the authority to setup a special prosecutor's office to investigate allegedwrongdoing by powerful federal officials. Judge Thomasasserted that Justice Rehnquist, who wrote the majorityopinion upholding Congress's action, &quot;failed not onlyconservatives but all Americans.&quot;                                                                                                          PRESS. In his opening salvo against the JudiciaryCommittee and other foes, Judge Thomas recounted with disgustthe worst parts of his ordeal, describing &quot;reporters sneakinginto my garage to examine books that I read, reporters andinterest groups swarming over divorce papers, looking fordirt.&quot;   Armstrong Williams, a Thomas friend and former aide,reports that the judge in part blames the media for histroubles. &quot;The media took the whole thing and sensationalizedit, promoted false charges, just like the Tawana Brawleycase,&quot; Mr. Williams says.   There are no cases involving press freedoms on the court'sdocket and Judge Thomas has had very limited First Amendmentexperience, a gap that gave the American Bar Associationreservations about the nominee. Surely, though, the past 10days haven't made him any fan of the media.   And, in all probability, reporters will continue theirdigging into Judge Thomas's past in an effort to get to thebottom of Anita Hill's charges. &quot;There's a Pulitzer Prize outthere waiting for any reporter who solves this mystery,&quot;observes Susan Estrich, a law professor at the University ofSouthern California, who helped run Gov. Michael Dukakis'scampaign for the presidency in 1988.   Once confirmed, a Supreme Court justice &quot;probably can't&quot;be impeached for past infractions, such as lying to Congressor committing sexual harassment, says Laurence Tribe ofHarvard Law School. The Constitution says justices may serveas long as they maintain &quot;good behavior,&quot; and that isgenerally understood to mean good behavior after they takethe oath, according to Prof. Tribe. That question remains amurky one, however, because it hasn't been squarelyaddressed.                                                                                                          RIGHTS OF ACCUSED. In one of the more bizarre colloquiesof the Judiciary Committee spectacle, Democratic Sen. DennisDeConcini of Arizona, a member of the ethically tarnished&quot;Keating Five,&quot; commiserated with Judge Thomas about beingpilloried. Although he didn't return the sympathy, JudgeThomas did say that &quot;on matters such as privacy, matters suchas procedures for charges against individuals in the criminalcontext . . . this has heightened my awareness of theimportance of those protections.&quot;   Judge Thomas gave earlier hints that on protection ofcriminals' rights he might surprise his conservative backers.In the first phase of the hearings in September, Judge Thomasspoke of watching from his appeals court office the bus loadsof black prisoners and thinking, &quot;There but for the grace ofGod go I.&quot;   Being under the glare of the interrogators' spotlight&quot;could open his eyes, sure,&quot; says Michigan Prof. Kamisar.   Judge Thomas will have an opportunity to apply hiscriminal-law views in the case of Jacobson vs. U.S., which isscheduled to be argued next month. Government agents usedthree undercover operations over 29 months to send mailingsfrom phony pornography publishers to Nebraska farmer KeithJacobson. He eventually agreed to receive a magazinedepicting sexual acts between teen-age boys, and he wasprosecuted. Mr. Jacobson contends he wouldn't have bought themagazine were it not for the government trap.   In the end, some critics of Judge Thomas worry that hisrecent experiences will send him onto the court as anembittered man bent on revenge against his perceivedtormentors. &quot;This is a dangerous way to send someone to theSupreme Court, feeling as victimized as he does,&quot; says Ms.Rogers, the Washington attorney.   But John Danforth, Judge Thomas's most passionate defenderin the Senate, says going through the &quot;agonies of hell&quot; hasmade Clarence Thomas &quot;more sensitive to civil rights, to thenecessity of legal protection of the people of this country,than most people who could conceivably be nominated for theSupreme Court.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
