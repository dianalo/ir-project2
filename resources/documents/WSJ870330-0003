By midday in Tokyo Monday, the U.S. currency was quoted at 145.30 yen -- another post-World War II low and down 1.2% from its quote of 147.10 yen in late New York trading Friday. Friday's level represented a drop of 1.6% from Thursday, the sharpest one-day decline since the central-bank purchases began last Tuesday.    The Japanese central bank intervened at the start of Monday's Tokyo trading, dealers said. That marked the continuation of last week's five-nation effort to support the U.S. unit against the yen -- arguably the largest show of cooperative intervention ever in the currency market.    Dealers in Tokyo said the size of Monday's early intervention was relatively small. One dealer estimated that the Bank of Japan had purchased $200 million in the U.S. currency.    Last week, in hectic transactions spanning three continents and nearly every time zone, central banks from five leading industrialized nations sold yen to purchase at least $6 billion of the U.S. currency, according to many estimates. Nonetheless, the dollar continued to fall.    Fallout from Friday's plunge in the dollar was detected in many other markets. U.S. stock and bond markets fell sharply while precious metals prices rallied, partly on expectations of renewed inflation. The dollar's reduced buying power abroad translates into higher import prices.    Last week's intervention was begun Tuesday in Tokyo by the Bank of Japan and was joined in almost daily by the West German Bundesbank, the Bank of England and the Bank of France in Europe, as well as the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in the U.S. The action was reminiscent of the central bank assault on the dollar that followed a September 1985 agreement by these same countries, then known as the Group of Five.    The earlier effort, designed to weaken the dollar as a way of cutting the U.S. trade deficit, unquestionably succeeded in driving the U.S. currency down. But the task then was much easier: The dollar was already in a decline.    &quot;They were pushing on a ball that was rolling downhill anyway,&quot; Garrett R. Glass, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago, says. &quot;No intervention has succeeded in trying to reverse the tide,&quot; he says.    Last week, the central banks were fighting against the market, which by some estimates trades as much as $250 billion a day world-wide.    &quot;There is no central bank in the world that can stand there and absorb the funds that can come into the market,&quot; says James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York and a former New York Fed currency trader. &quot;If you're sitting in Japan, you have to conclude that the intervention was a failure.&quot;    Intervention against the trend can succeed, at least temporarily, if it catches the market off balance, or when speculators are heavily exposed with oversold or overbought currency positions.    &quot;They think they're battling speculators now, but they aren't,&quot; Mr. Glass says of the central banks. &quot;They're really fighting the investment community -- long-term holders of dollars who want to exchange their dollars for yen.&quot;    To some, whether last week's intervention succeeded or failed is an unanswerable question.    &quot;You have to ask, 'Where would the dollar be in the absence of intervention?'&quot; Lawrence L. Kreicher, vice president and economist at Irving Trust Co., New York, says. &quot;Who knows? Maybe the dollar would be at 140 (yen) if the central banks hadn't come in. To dismiss the intervention as futile and ineffective is misleading.&quot;    As another weapon for defending the dollar, Mr. Glass says, the U.S. Federal Reserve could turn to interest rates. He notes that Fed Chairman Paul Volcker has said the dollar has fallen far enough and that its decline poses a threat of renewed inflation. Higher interest rates would increase demand for the dollar by making dollar-denominated investments more attractive.    In the meantime, Mr. Glass warns of the risk of a &quot;snowballing phenomenon,&quot; as the dollar's latest decline in the face of heavy intervention on its behalf might spur more speculators to sell the currency.    For fundamental economic reasons, particularly the U.S. trade and budget deficits, many dealers and economists see the dollar tumbling at least as low as 140 yen this year. &quot;We could see a period of stability, but inevitably, the dollar's going lower,&quot; Mr. Kreicher says.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for March delivery soared $10.30 an ounce to $421.80 in heavy trading estimated at 6.5 million ounces.    In precious metals futures trading, May silver settled 28 cents higher at $6.24 an ounce, April gold rose $11 to $422.70 an ounce, and April platinum climbed the daily limit of $25 an ounce to $564.10.    Gold was quoted at $420.30 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                     CURRENCY RATES                  LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Friday, March 27, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
