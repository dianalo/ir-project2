Since March, three agents from the Miami office, the DEA'slargest with 350 agents, have been charged with protecting the drugtraffickers they were supposed to be throwing in jail.   They join three others convicted here since the early 1980s ofaiding or supplying information to drug smugglers in return forhundreds of thousands of dollars.   But that doesn't mean the Medellin Cartel has somehow penetratedthe DEA's top-secret operations, says John Fernandes, a DEAspokesman here.   ``I don't know of any agents who were killed or any majorinvestigations compromised by these cases,'' he said. ``These wereall isolated incidents.''   Most DEA officials are reluctant to talk about cleaning theirown house _ the DEA's Washington headquarters failed to respond torepeated requests by The Associated Press for the number of agentsarrested nationally on charges of drug involvement.   But Tom Cash, special agent in charge of the Miami office,confronts the issue head-on.   ``This is elephant-land for cocaine,'' he said. ``Last year weseized $178 million in cash and property, and 40 percent of thatwas green.''   Cash pulled a photo from his office wall of agents posing with a$1.9 million cash haul, and pointed to individually wrapped packetsof $100 bills.   ``Each one of those is $10,000,'' Cash says. ``The agent thinks,`Suppose I put two or three of these in my pocket _ who's going toknow the difference?'''   A spokesman for the federal Office of National Drug ControlPolicy in Washington says corruption in the DEA, while consideredlow-level, is a cause for concern.   ``It's a problem we're aware of and will be looking into,'' saidLarry Cirignano, spokesman for director William J. Bennett. ``Theproblem is money. At some point, everybody comes to a price, eventhough you hope they don't.''   Because of the huge amounts of cash agents deal with, and thenecessity of working undercover with informants who themselvesactively engage in trafficking, the DEA is the nation's mosttempted law-enforcement agency, Cash said.   In response, the DEA has an unforgiving policy to combat theline-crossers, and those who allow confidential information to ``gosouth'' to traffickers, as the agents say.   ``We don't sweep these cases under the rug,'' Cash said. ``Andwe do not just fire people for violations of law _ we prosecutethem.''   In addition, the DEA has a tight system to finger an agent whowanders from standard procedures.   Agents generally work in groups of about a dozen, and anyone whodisplays too much interest in a case outside his jurisdictionimmediately comes under scrutiny.   The DEA keeps track of every request for its computerized files,and can later cross-check for suspicious activity if it appearstraffickers know too much. There are about 2 million files in thenational computer system. In Miami, the agency is currentlyinvestigating 3,000 cases and using about 500 informants.   When operating in the field, confiscated cash and drugs must becounted by at least two agents. Whenever possible, agents avoidcounting cash at all and just bundle it up and send it to a bank.Because of the slippery nature of dealings with informants, noagent is supposed to meet an informant alone.   All agents _ including Cash himself _ must take a monthly drugtest. Failure means immediate dismissal.   And every complaint against an agent, no matter what its sourceor how dubious, is investigated, Cash said.   ``No check would ever be so thorough as when it involves a DEAagent,'' Cash says. ``We would spend our whole budget on it, ifnecessary.''   Cash has developed a surprising theory on which agents are mostlikely to cross the line.   ``It's not the average special agent who is involved in thesetypes of incidents _ it's the very best. Most of them wereproblem-free,'' he said. ``They're the ones who are workingundercover, running up against the very best on the other side.''   After a while, they believe they know the system and can beatit, he said.   The recent Miami cases bear him out. All involved agents had atleast nine years of experience in the agency.   Jorge Villar, who worked with Metro-Dade police before joiningDEA 11 years ago, was arrested in March for allegedly agreeing toaccept $300,000 to protect a cocaine shipment from the Bahamas.   Arrested together last month were agents Drew Bunnell and AlIglesias, who were accused of wanting $100,000 from an informant tohelp him hide a cocaine ripoff by disguising it as a bust. Bunnellhad nine years with the DEA and Iglesias 14.</TEXT></DOC>
