ApcarStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/23/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MDESTPETROLEUM (PET)MONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON) </IN><TEXT>   OPEC's new effort to raise prices may force fuel prices higher in the U.S., but will fall short of reviving depressed domestic oil exploration.    Thus, while U.S. consumers may have to bear the burden of the $18-a-barrel oil price level targeted by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, they won't be assured that supplies at home will be replenished.    That at least is the view of U.S. petroleum refiners, who will feel the most immediate effects of OPEC's weekend agreement on a fixed-price structure to begin Feb. 1.    Bankers and economists predicted, however, that the accord's impact on the Southwest would be generally positive, providing more stability to oil prices and producing a ripple effect that would bring improvement throughout the region.    Some refiners expect their crude costs to rise as much as $3 or $4 a barrel over the next few months, if OPEC succeeds in reaching the $18 target. That would translate to higher fuel prices of between six cents and 10 cents a gallon to consumers if refiners are able to pass on their increased costs to consumers.    As crude costs increase, &quot;product prices will follow,&quot; said Ray Steiner, vice president of supply and transportation for Phillips Petroleum Co. &quot;It won't be immediate, but it's going to happen.&quot;    But at the retail level, higher gasoline and fuel-oil prices for U.S. consumers probably won't appear for some weeks, perhaps not until after the new prices appear Feb. 1. Part of this delay is because of the month or so required for a tanker of crude to reach the U.S. from the Middle East. Another factor is the large amount of crude oil inventories purchased at lower prices and still held by U.S. refiners.    However, Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist at Ashland Oil Inc., pointed out that OPEC's success at returning to a fixed-price system isn't assured, and in any event could take longer than Feb. 1 to complete. With oil markets beginning to firm in the wake of OPEC's decision, he said, some refiners may decide to sell off excess inventories and take profits. The sell-off could, in turn, delay OPEC's return to a fixed-price system, he said.    In any event, Mr. Tahmassebi said, Ashland and other refiners will be scrambling for cheaper crude elsewhere once OPEC's prices rise. &quot;It's still a buyers' market,&quot; he said, &quot;and the refiners will be shopping around.&quot; Many U.S. refiners, he said, have modified their plants so that they can process most types of crude, even the heaviest lowest-quality grades.    Others questioned, however, whether there will be much flexibility for refiners to buy cheaper crudes once the new OPEC pricing system is made effective. They said even non-OPEC producers including Mexico and those operating in the North Sea would be cautious about undercutting OPEC prices.    &quot;Buyers are going to resist paying those set prices, but the market is already driving up crude prices,&quot; said an official of Baltimore-based Crown Central Petroleum. Although Crown Central already has purchased its crude requirements for January, the official already worries about passing through the higher costs of future purchases to fuel consumers. &quot;Our crude costs could be up as much as $4 a barrel, and that's another dime a gallon at the gasoline pump on top of the extra taxes most state legislatures are planning in the area where we market,&quot; he said.    &quot;If everybody in OPEC sticks to the production quotas, there's no question the crude oil price will go up, and if the price goes up, refiners will pay it,&quot; said Theodore Eck, chief economist at Amoco Corp. &quot;And refinery margins aren't generous,&quot; he added.    Others noted that good-quality crudes in the U.S. should maintain the traditional $1-a-barrel edge over main OPEC crudes. That would put West Texas Intermediate, the most abundantly sold U.S. crude, at near $19 a barrel, compared with about $15 that refiners currently pay.    But even that higher price probably won't revive U.S. oil exploration to previous levels. &quot;If the OPEC results turn out as those countries hope, we are probably going to see slightly higher exploration and production budgets evolve during the year,&quot; said Glenn Cox, president of Phillips. &quot;But there's too much uncertainty, and any change will be gradual,&quot; he said.    Most oil companies, including Phillips and Standard Oil Co., are basing their 1987 capital spending plans on $15-a-barrel crude. As a result, Mr. Cox said, Phillips' spending for 1987 &quot;looks almost like 1986 all over again.&quot; This year, Phillips will spend around $700 million, compared with $1.09 billion in 1985.    For prices and exploration budgets, the second quarter of 1987 will provide &quot;the real test,&quot; said William Hermann, chief economist at Chevron Corp. &quot;No one can say with any certainty that prices will stay there (at the OPEC $18 target), and I wouldn't expect any rash moves in exploration spending in the next six months,&quot; he said.    &quot;It will take a lot more than $17 to $18 oil to revive exploration,&quot; said E.L. Williamson, chairman of Louisiana Land andamp; Exploration Co., which halved its exploration and development spending to $150 million this year and expects 1987 spending to be down slightly from the 1986 level.    Despite their optimism about the eventual effects higher oil prices could have in the Southwest, bankers and economists were divided on the strength of the impact.    &quot;It's not going to turn a struggling state economy into a booming economy,&quot; said Joseph E. Burns, Texas American Bancshares Inc.'s senior vice president and economist. &quot;It's just going to turn it into a little less sluggish state economy.&quot; He suggested that layoffs wouldn't be as high as they have been and that some firms would hire a few more workers.    Others offered a more optimistic view of the effects that added price stability would have should OPEC succeed.    &quot;The probability of lower oil prices is reduced to a negligible possibility,&quot; said Edward L. McClelland, RepublicBank Corp.'s vice president and economist. Once prices start to improve, &quot;a significant rise in drilling&quot; for oil near other producing wells would result, he says, bringing some relief to the area. He predicted that companies would hire more workers, rent more office space and help to strengthen the currently weak demand for housing in the Southwest's largest cities.    Most of the region's economists offered views that were less positive, however. &quot;I don't think this is enough to really turn around and propel forward near-term economic growth,&quot; in Texas or the Southwest, says Stephen Brown, a senior economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve Bank.    For some energy concerns, the possibility of oil jumping to $18 a barrel is &quot;a pretty good size increase in current cash flow and that gives them a little more breathing room than they had,&quot; says Larry L. Helm, an InterFirst Bank Dallas executive vice president and its chief energy lender. But he doubts that drilling activity will pick up markedly. &quot;People aren't going to go out and drill a bunch more wells.&quot;    Mr. Helm said, however, the price increase will give a lift to the &quot;psychology of the marketplace&quot; that took a drubbing all year. If OPEC can achieve $18 or $19 a barrel, he says, oil concerns will &quot;believe their downside risk is maybe $15 a barrel instead of (the) $10 or $12&quot; pricing the industry feared through most of 1986. That kind of confidence will lead to an increase in drilling, he predicted.    As for the bank's lending operations, Mr. Helm says it's too early to tell whether some troubled loans will begin to be paid down on time. &quot;It could very well take some loans from nonperforming status to performing,&quot; Mr. Helms said. Those are likely to be loans to oil producers, who may get more money for their oil and whose reserve values will rise. The status of loans to oil-field service companies, which have been hit hardest by the lack of drilling, probably won't be helped as much, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
