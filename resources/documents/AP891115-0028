Under the measure, anti-drug funds would climb to $8.8 billionthis year, $900 million more than requested by President Bush onSept. 5 in a nationally televised address outlining his plan ofattack on narcotics.   Approval of the funds represents the major congressional actionon the drug issue thus far this year. The House and Senate areforming a fresh conference committee to try to resolve differencesover non-money items, including the administration's so-calledAndean Strategy.   The funds were included in an overall $12 billion money bill forthe Transportation Department in the fiscal year that began Oct. 1.   The rest of the transportation bill received final congressionalapproval from the Senate last week with only the anti-drug moneydrawing fire. It was approved Tuesday by unanimous consent withoutdiscussion.   All but a few details had been worked out between theadministration and Senate negotiators in September. The conferencecommittee last month dropped all non-money items but made onlyminor funding changes.   The House approved the money Nov. 1 on a voice vote.   Included in the package is $1 billion for the federal prisonsystem for buildings, $308 million for law enforcement grants tostate and local governments as well as $727 million for programsinvolving alcohol, drug abuse and mental health.   The House on Monday approved four bills containing the non-moneyitems that had been detached from the package. The Senate onTuesday considered those four bills, substituted its own versionfor the language approved by the House and sent the measures to aHouse-Senate conference committee.   The primary measure would authorize military training and lawenforcement assistance for Bolivia, Colombia and Peru under theadministration's so-called Andean Strategy. Mexico and othercountries also would receive aid under the proposal.   Other measures would expand a drug-free schools program approvedby Congress earlier this year, allow transfers out of the fund forassets seized from drug dealers and divide the alcohol, drug abuseand mental health block grant program into separate programs forsubstance abuse and mental health.   The overall transportation bill permanently prohibits smokingaboard nearly all airline flights within the United States.   Smoking would be allowed on flights originating in Alaska orHawaii or bound for those states and scheduled to last longer thansix hours _ about 28 out of 17,500 daily U.S. flights.   Currently, smoking is banned on flights lasting two hours orless. The new rules would take effect 96 days after the measure issigned into law.   The same measure provides $12 billion for federal transportationprograms for the new fiscal year. The bill includes $30.7 millionto subsidize air carriers that serve small towns, and a $40 milliondown payment to build a new airport in Denver, the first new U.S.airport in 15 years.</TEXT></DOC>
