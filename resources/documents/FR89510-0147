Reg. A-31 (54 FR 28, January3, 1989) is canceled and deleted from the appendix at the end of SubchapterA in 41 CFR Chapter 101. The General Services Administration (GSA) has determined that this ruleis not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order 12291 of February17, 1981, because it is not likely to result in an annual effect on theeconomy of $100 million or more, a major increase in costs to consumersor others, or significant adverse effects. GSA has based all administrativedecisions underlying this rule on adequate information concerning the needfor, and consequences of, this rule; has determined that the potentialbenefits to society from this rule outweigh the potential costs and hasmaximized the net benefits; and has chosen the alternative approach involvingthe least net cost to society. By the Administrator's authority (Sec. 205(c), 63 Stat. 390; 40 U.S.C.486(c)), FTR Temporary Regulation 3 is added to the appendix at the endof Subtitle F of Title 41 of the Code of Federal Regulations to read asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="84">Federal Travel Regulation Temporary Regulation 3 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="44">April 5, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">To: Heads of Federal agencies. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="16">Subject: Travel and transportation expense payment system using contractor-issuedcharge cards, centrally-billed accounts, and travelers checks. </ITAG>1. <T3>Purpose.</T3> This regulation prescribes policies and procedures fora travel and transportation expense payment system which provides for theuse of General Services Administration (GSA) contractor-issued charge cards,centrally-billed accounts, and travelers checks by Federal agencies andtheir travelers to procure passenger transportation services, car rentals,and subsistence (lodging, meals, etc.) from commercial facilities, andto pay for miscellaneous travel and transportation expenses incurred duringofficial travel. 2. <T3>Effective date.</T3> This regulation is effective May 10, 1989. 3. <T3>Expiration date.</T3> This regulation expires November 29, 1989, unlesssooner canceled or revised. 4. <T3>Scope.</T3> This regulation shall be used in conjunction with the FederalTravel Regulation (FTR) (see 41 CFR Chapters 301 through 304) and 41 CFRPart 101-41. Except as provided in this temporary regulation, all provisionsof the FTR, 41 CFR Part 101-41, and related regulations (e.g., FTR Temp.Reg. 2, governing use of airline/rail contract fares) continue in effect.5. <T3>Applicability. </T3>a. This regulation applies to Federal agencies and departments that participatein GSA's travel and transportation expense payment system using contractor-issuedcharge cards, centrally-billed accounts, and travelers checks. b.

Under 41 CFR 101-41.203, Federal agencies normally use a U.S. GovernmentTransportation Request (GTR), SF 1169, to purchase passenger transportationservices directly from a common carrier or through a commercial travelagent under contract to GSA. (See FTR Temporary Regulation 1.) Also, underthe FTR, travelers are eligible for advances to pay for allowable travelexpenses. Upon completion of official travel, the employee submits a travelvoucher to the agency finance office, which reimburses the employee forauthorized and allowable travel expenses. b. Authority to deviate from 41 CFR 101-41.203 was granted by the Administratorof General Services on August 4, 1983, thus allowing eligible individualsto participate in the charge card program. (See 48 FR 36893, dated August15, 1983.) c. GSA has entered into a new contract with Citibank/Diners Club, Inc.,to issue and maintain charge cards and establish centrally-billed accounts.GSA has also contracted with Citicorp for the issuance of travelers checksto be used by Federal employees to cover subsistence and other allowabletravel and minor transportation expenses. d. For more effective cash management, Office of Management and Budget(OMB) Bulletin 88-17, dated July 22, 1988, prescribes that agencies shouldadvance travel funds in the form of travelers checks when determined tobe in the best interest of the Government. 7. <T3>Definitions.</T3> For the purposes of this regulation, certain termsused herein are defined as follows: a. ``Centrally-billed'' means a Government Travel System account establishedby the contractor at the request of a participating agency. b.
