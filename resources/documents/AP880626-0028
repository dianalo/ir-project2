Brief running clashes broke out around Myongdong Cathedral ashundreds of riot police in green combat fatigues and black helmetsstopped students from marching in the streets.   Firebombs hurled by students at police started the blaze in theground floor of an office building. Smoke poured from two floors asfirefighters and police extinguished the blaze, which apparentlywas started by accident.   The building had been closed and there were no reports ofinjuries from the blaze. Police officers said offices on the groundfloor were damaged.   A number of students and police officers were hurt in thefighting, but there were no figures on injuries or arrests.   Radicals called for a major rally and march at the cathedral tomark nationwide riots in June 1987 and press for the overthrow ofthe government of President Roh Tae-woo.   But hundreds of police stopped many students from reaching thecathedral. Only about 200 got through. The students at thecathedral stormed out to break police lines so others could getthrough, but they were driven back by tear gas.   Radicals use the cathedral as a sanctuary because police do notenter for fear of offending public opinion and church authorities.   Student leaders, addressing the rally in the cathedral grounds,denounced Roh and former President Chun Doo-hwan as dictators.   Speakers demanded Roh and Chun be punished for the bloodysuppression in 1980 of an anti-government revolt in the southerncity of Kwangju in which at least 191 people were killed.   ``Down with Roh Tae-woo and Chun Doo-hwan!'' students shouted.   Protesters also chanted ``Yankee go home!'' and speakers chargedthe United States helped suppress the Kwangju revolt and backedmilitary rule in South Korea.   Radical groups had called on people to show support for theprotest by honking car horns and joining the rally, but there wereno signs of public support. The radicals are a small minority, andfew South Koreans support their demands for reunification of theKorean Peninsula and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from the South.   The students, some armed with clubs, firebombs and rocks,started to march out of the cathedral compound. Protesters leadingthe march hurled firebombs at police blocking surrounding streets.   Riot police tossed tear gas grenades and rifle squads firedvolleys of tear gas to drive back the attacking students.   Priests used the cathedral's public address system to appeal tostudents to stop fighting and police to stop firing tear gas. Bothsides ignored the appeals.   Fighting stopped later as flames and smoke poured from thebuilding hit by firebombs.</TEXT></DOC>
