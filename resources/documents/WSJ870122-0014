Mr. Shultz told a closed-door hearing of the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that State Department and CIA officials met with the Iranians in Europe on Dec. 6, but that the department ended the session when the Iranians wanted to discuss exchanging weapons for American hostages, the sources said. But Mr. Shultz said that CIA officials, despite his misgivings, held another session with the Iranian contacts.    The December meeting occurred after the White House had set off a political firestorm by disclosing in November that some of the profits from secret arms sales to Iran had been funneled to the Contra rebels battling Nicaragua's leftist government.    Mr. Shultz also told the committee that he was aware of several sources of funding for the Contras, and that the State Department was involved in three of those, according to sources at yesterday's hearing. These activities were taking place at a time when Congress had prohibited the U.S. from providing aid to the Contras.    Mr. Shultz's references to the sources of funding was a reminder of the intricate corporate network that has overseen a supply line on behalf of the Contras running from Switzerland to Central America. Information from public records in various countries yesterday shed new light on some aspects of this network.    Intelligence sources said yesterday that the CIA was seeking to build Iranian contacts and was reluctant to cut off the sources it had developed.    The sources said Mr. Shultz told the panel that at the Dec. 6 meeting, the Iranians produced a nine-point agenda that contained both American and Iranian demands. Mr. Shultz said the State Department officials at the meeting hadn't previously seen the document, which he called a &quot;draft agenda.&quot;    According to one source, Mr. Shultz said the draft agenda contained a proposal to exchange about 1,000 TOW antitank missiles for four American hostages. Mr. Shultz also said the State Department has a copy of the draft, but wasn't certain whether it was the latest version.    When the State Department officials concluded that Tehran still was interested in exchanging weapons for U.S. hostages held in Lebanon by radical groups under Iran's influence, the department officials decided to cancel the Iranian &quot;channel,&quot; Mr. Shultz told the committee.    Mr. Shultz added that the State Department officials then flew home, the sources said. But, he added, the CIA officials remained and held another session with the Iranians. Mr. Shultz told the panel that he was furious because shortly after the Iran scandal broke, President Reagan said that he was putting the State Department in charge of policy on Iran.    He told the committee that he tried to call President Reagan last month to complain, and was further angered when a White House staff member asked why he wanted to talk to the president, the sources said. Mr. Shultz then called President Reagan on a Sunday morning and was invited by Mr. Reagan to come over.    Mr. Shultz also told the committee that Israel was an active player in the dealings with Iran, the sources said. According to a source at yesterday's hearing, although Mr. Shultz didn't blame Israel for the U.S. actions, he indicated to the panel that &quot;every time he was told the deal was dead, some Israeli would come over and stir the flames.&quot;    Some congressional sources suggested that Mr. Shultz used the hearing to defend himself and his department and to blame other agencies for the Iran-Contra affair, as he has done since the scandal broke.    One committee member, Rep. Robert Torricelli (D., N.J.), said that Mr. Shultz was &quot;thoroughly organizing his own defense. He outlined the limits of his knowledge, and he won the sympathy of the committee by convincing them that George Shultz was a victim.&quot;    One congressional source said Mr. Shultz referred repeatedly to &quot;another country&quot; when discussing the three sources of Contra funding that the department had been involved with. However, one panel member said he concluded that Mr. Shultz was referring to three countries: Brunei, Saudia Arabia and Israel.    State Department spokesmen have said that department officials solicited a $10 million contribution from the sultan of Brunei, one of the world's wealthiest men. Other Reagan administration officials have said that the Saudis have given money to the Contras, but the Saudi government has denied making such contributions.    Mr. Shultz also told the panel that the State Department was involved in contacting another country -- presumed to be Israel -- to acquire communications equipment for the Contras. He said, however, that the country didn't have the kind of equipment needed by the Nicaraguan rebels, the sources said.    Meanwhile, the White House announced that President Reagan will meet Monday with the Tower Commission, which is reviewing the National Security Council's role in the Iran-Contra affair.    The commission originally was given until the end of January to complete its work. The deadline has been extended to Feb. 19 because of a larger-than-expected work load. White House spokesman Larry Speakes said some 40 witnesses have been interviewed, and the panel wants to talk to 15 to 20 more.    The meeting Monday will be Mr. Reagan's first with the three-member commission, headed by former Texas Republican Sen. John Tower, which was appointed in November. Mr. Speakes said the panel members &quot;will probably ask for his (Mr. Reagan's) recollections&quot; regarding the role of the national security staff in the affair.    Mr. Reagan met yesterday for 25 minutes with David Abshire, his special counsel on the Iran-Contra affair. Sources said Mr. Abshire briefed the president on conversations he has had with members of the House and Senate select committees investigating the affair.    Mr. Abshire also met with leaders of the Senate select committee and pledged his cooperation. Chairman Daniel Inouye, (D., Hawaii) said significantly more records would be made available than those reviewed by the Senate Intelligence Committee in its inquiry late last year.    Information from public records in Panama, Switzerland and Bermuda provided a new aspect to the supply network to the Contras. Panamanian shell corporations figure prominently in this network, and a check of Panamanian records establishes a close connection between a Geneva-based financial-services company, Cie. des Services Fiduciares, or CSF, and a front company that owns a freighter used in shipping arms to the Contras.    The Panamanian company, Dolmy Business Inc., was established in November 1985 by a Panama City attorney who had performed similar services for the supply network. Dolmy's top officers include Roland Farina and Jacques Mossaz, who are linked to CSF.    According to Swiss records, Mr. Mossaz once was affiliated with an air-transport company that reportedly played a role in the dealings with Iran. According to Bermuda records, Mr. Farina is linked to a Bermuda firm, CSF Investments, that reportedly helped finance the purchase of aircraft for the guerrilla forces.    Both men have been associated with Willard Zucker, a Geneva attorney and principal in CSF who has had longstanding ties to businessman Albert Hakim, and through him to former Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord.    Mr. Hakim and Gen. Secord were the principal overseers of the network, according to intelligence sources. Meanwhile, Mr. Zucker emerges as the legal expert in the network and Gen. Secord's friend, former CIA official Thomas Clines, appears to be more a field operative.    The history of the freighter, Erria, and its travel, first identified in detail by the Los Angeles Times, corresponds with previous accounts given by intelligence sources of a shipment of arms for the Contras through Honduras in 1985, and an unsuccessful effort off Cyprus last May to win the release of U.S. hostages in Lebanon. That effort included a $1 million ransom put up by Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot. </TEXT></DOC>
