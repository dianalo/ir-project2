The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said the 13,541 banks itinsures collectively earned $5 billion in the first three months ofthis year, down somewhat from $5.3 billion in the same period in1987.   However, earnings would have hit a new record high if not for thehuge $1.49 billion loss at a single Dallas bank holding company,said FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman.   Banks' first quarter losses in the Southwest totaled $1.64billion, 90 percent of that from First RepublicBank Corp.   The FDIC has already pumped $1 billion into First RepublicBank,Texas' largest banking organization, and may have to spend another$1 billion to attract a buyer to take it over.   Seidman said the FDIC is negotiating with potential investors andhoped to put First RepublicBank back on its feet in the ``reasonablynear future.''   Last year was the worst since the Depression for commercialbanks: 184 banks failed, a record high, and banks as a whole earnedonly $3.6 billion, a record low, as big banks added to theirreserves in anticipation of losses on loans to developing countries.   Banks this year are continuing to fail at the 1987 rate.Seventy-five had closed their doors as of last Friday, 32 of them inTexas.   But otherwise Seidman painted a generally optimistic picture for1988.   The number of banks on the FDIC's problem list has dropped below1,500 for the first time in two years, he said. There were 1,491such institutions at the end of March, compared with a peak above1,600 in mid-1987.   The big money-center banks have written off about 25 percent to30 percent of their Third World loans and that alone was responsiblefor much of last year's depressed earnings. Those reserve levelsstill look reasonable, he said.   Prospects are also looking up for banks in the Midwest, a regionwhere banks were affected by hard times on the farm. The percentageof Midwest banks reporting losses fell from 13.5 percent in thefirst quarter a year ago to only 7.6 percent this year.   Even in the Southwest there is reason for hope, Seidman said.Twenty-seven percent of the banks in the region lost money in thefirst three months of this year, compared with 36 percent for all oflast year.   ``We expect the worst for Texas will be behind us after 1988,''he said. ``The smaller banks in Texas are beginning to show someimprovement. Nothing large, but they are moving in the rightdirection.''   Seidman also said he believed nationally banks were ``reasonablywell protected'' against rising interest rates and could withstand arecession next year, provided the downturn is not extraordinarilydeep or extended.   He described his agency's insurance fund as ``solid,'' eventhough the price tag on the First RepublicBank bailout may cause thefund to register its first loss since it was established in 1934.   ``We think we can handle anything we see on the horizon,'' hesaid.   Despite record failures and record low earnings, commercial banksare still in far better shape than the 3,120 federally insuredsavings institutions, which lost $6.8 billion last year. Firstquarter figures are not yet available for thrifts.</TEXT></DOC>
