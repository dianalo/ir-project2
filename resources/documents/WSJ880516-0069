A spokesman for GE, which is based in Fairfield, Conn., said the company hadn't yet determined how many workers would be laid off in the defense-systems unit, which employs 4,700 people. The Associated Press quoted a Massachusetts state official as saying he has been told by GE officials that the company would lay off 900 workers over the next 18 months.    The GE spokesman said &quot;drastic action&quot; became necessary when both the Army and Navy recently cut back on programs for which GE was a supplier, and when GE lost out in bidding on a third project.    The spokesman said the Navy has put off for as long as five years the construction of two Trident submarines, for which the company makes missile-guidance and fire-control systems. He said the Army has scaled back its purchases of the Bradley fighting vehicle -- a lightweight, armored personnel carrier -- to about 350 a year from about 550. The GE unit makes transmissions and stabilization systems for the vehicle.    The company also lost out on a bid to produce a new missile-guidance system for the Air Force, the spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
