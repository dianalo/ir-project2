Wickes also said that on Dec. 1 it will call in its $200 million issue of 12% subordinated debentures due 1994, assuming market conditions remain essentially the same.    Wickes said the British unit, Wickes PLC, will be purchased by Cityquest PLC, a company formed by the unit's chairman, Henry Sweetbaum, and other senior members of management. Wickes PLC operates building supply and home improvement centers in the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.    Wickes will have a gain before taxes of about $120 million as a result of the sale, the company said. The sale is expected to be completed about May 30, the company added.    Sanford C. Sigoloff, Wickes's chairman and chief executive officer, said the company decided to sell the unit because its earnings &quot;aren't repatriated (since the unit is based overseas), and therefore cash return to its parent has been small.&quot; Mr. Sigoloff said the current exchange rate and market conditions were other reasons for the sale.    Wickes's proposed 1-for-5 reverse stock split would reduce its 239 million shares to 48 million.    Mr. Sigoloff said management and the board felt that the reverse stock split would aid in &quot;positioning the stock&quot; as well as reduce costs for stock transactions because of the fewer number of shares outstanding.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Wickes closed at $4, up 12.5 cents. Wickes is involved in building products and retailing and makes apparel and other consumer items.    Wickes PLC shares currently are quoted on the Unlisted Securities Market, London's second-tier market. If the transaction is completed, the unit said, it intends to seek a listing on the London Stock Exchange because no single shareholders would have more than a 75% stake. Such a move, the unit said, should make raising funds easier. Mr. Sweetbaum said that &quot;it should give us access to investors that we didn't have before.&quot;    Wickes didn't say whether it would pay off its $200 million issue of 12% notes with cash or refinance them. Many companies have been calling in debt of 12% or more since interest rates have declined substantially below that figure. </TEXT></DOC>
