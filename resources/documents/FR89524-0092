Introduction  </ITAG>Daminozide is the active ingredient of Alar, Kylar, and B-nine, formulatedproducts manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Company, Inc. Daminozide ismanufactured by reacting succinic acid with 1,1-(unsymmetrical) dimethylhydrazine(UDMH) to make succinic acid dimethyl hydrazine (SADH) ``The PesticideManual,'' 1979). Although daminozide is the parent compound and activeingredient in the products, UDMH is also present as a degradate and metaboliteof daminozide. It is a contaminant in both technical and formulated products,and daminozide degradation into UDMH increases as a function of time orincreasing temperature. For example, the formulation of UDMH from daminozideresidues is known to occur following the boiling and/or cooking of apples.Metabolism data have shown that daminozide hydrolyzes to UDMH in the mammalianbody.  Daminozide is a plant growth regulator used in controlling vegetative andreproductive growth of orchard crops such as apples, cherries, nectarines,peaches, and pears and other crops such as peanuts, grapes and tomatoes.On apples, daminozide's major use, it affects flower bud initiation, fruitset and maturity, preharvest fruit drop and the market quality of fruitat harvest and during storage. Daminozide can hasten and concentrate ripeningon peaches, sweet and tart cherries, and nectarines. On grapes, it canincrease fruit set. Daminozide can also retard stem elongation on tomatotransplants. On peanuts, daminozide can produce shorter, more erect peanutvines and can increase yields. The use of daminozide on ornamental plantscan produce shorter, more compact growth on chrysanthemums, azaleas, hyrangeas,and bedding plants.  Daminozide was first registered in 1963 by the Uniroyal Chemical Co., Inc.,for use on potted chrysanthemums. In 1968, daminozide was first registeredfor use on crops (apples) and was later registered for use on several otherraw agricultural commodities.  A variety of tolerances, which are the maximum permissible residue levelsallowed on raw agricultural commodities or as secondary residues such asthose found in meat, milk, and eggs, have been established for daminozidein a variety of crops. In instances where pesticides concentrate duringprocessing, food and feed additive regulations have been established. Tolerancesfor daminozide in or on raw agricultural commodities, processed foods andanimal feeds are listed in 40 CFR 180.246, 185.1550 and 186.1550. Thereare no separate tolerances established for residues of UDMH.  In the early 1980's, the Agency decided to review daminozide through itsRegistration Standard process and identify outstanding data gaps. Thisprocess was completed in 1984 and a Registration Standard was issued inJune of that year. Prior to the completion of the Registration Standard,in August 1983, the Agency issued a Data Call-In (DCI) Notice under section3(c)(2)(B) of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA)requiring registrants to generate certain metabolism and feeding studiesdata. In the Registration Standard, the Agency expressed its cancer riskconcern about daminozide and UDMH and through the accompanying DCI requiredadditional data not asked for in the August 1983 Data Call-In Notice. On July 18, 1984, EPA issued a Notice of Special Review of daminozide products(49 FR 29186) and a Position Document 1 (PD 1), which sets forth the scientificrationale for the Agency's action. This action was based on the Agencyfinding that registrations of pesticide products containing daminozidemet the risk criterion relating to oncogenicity in 40 CFR 162.11(a)(3)(ii)(A)(now 40 CFR 154.7(a)(2)(i)). That section provided that a Special Reviewshall be conducted if the use of a pesticide ``induces oncogenic effectsin experimental mammalian species or in man as a result of oral, inhalationor dermal exposure * * *.'' The PD 1 cited four chronic oncogenicity studiesthat had been conducted during the 1970's, two studies with daminozideand two studies with UDMH, that suggested a potential basis for concern(Toth, 1973; Toth 1977a; Toth, 1977b; NCI, 1978), each of which had certaindeficiencies that limited the usefulness of the studies for cancer riskassessment. The Agency decided to proceed with a cancellation action, despitethe limitations in the cancer data base because it believed that all fourrelevant studies, plus a 1984 inhalation study conducted by the U.S. AirForce (Haun, 1984), were sufficient when considered together to warrantsuch actions. In addition to causing oncogenic effects in laboratory animals,UDMH also appeared to be mutagenic in both the presence and absence ofmetabolic activity (Rogers and Back, 1981). The Agency has since receivedadditional data which show a negative UDMH mutagenic response in four assays. Because of the level of concern about dietary exposure, particularly toyoung children, the Agency developed a combined draft Preliminary and FinalDetermination (draft PD 2/3/4) and Draft Cancellation Notice, in September1985. The Draft PD 2/3/4 and Cancellation Notice were submitted to theScientific Advisory Panel (SAP) and the United States Department of Agriculture(USDA) as required by FIFRA. The SAP was established by Congress to providescientific review of pesticide actions taken by the Agency. The SAP believedthat the data from these studies were insufficient to support a quantitativerisk asssessment for either daminozide or UDMH because of various limitationsin methodology and documentation. Although EPA is not bound by SAP's opinion,the Panel's view is an integral part of Agency decisions. Based in largepart on the SAP's review, EPA concluded that it should not proceed withthe cancellation action at that time, but instead should take steps tominimize exposure to daminozide and UDMH and require Uniroyal to begina wide range of testing that would enable EPA to base its cancer risk assessmenton more complete and sound scientific data. In addition to requiring data,several measures were taken which were intended to reduce exposure. Theseincluded:  (1) The application rates for use on apples was reduced from 8 lbs/acreto 4 lbs/acre for Spring treatment and 3 lbs/acre for later treatment. (2) A use advisory cautioning against the use of daminozide on apples meantfor processing was to be included with each product labelled for use onapples.  (3) The use on daminozide on grapes was limited to those not used for raisins. The Agency also lowered the tolerance for residues of daminozide on applesfrom 30 parts per million (ppm) to 20 ppm (51 FR 12889); the Agency setan expiration date of July 31, 1987, for the reduced apple tolerance sinceit believed that some of the required residue data would be completed bythen and a further evaluation of the tolerance could be undertaken.  The new data required in 1986 under section 3(c)(2)(B) of FIFRA includeda 2-year drinking water oncogenicity study of UDMH using mice and rats.(A 2-year feeding study of daminozide using mice and rats had already beenstarted as a result of the DCI issued with the Registration Standard.)Uniroyal was required to perform interim sacrifices at 8 and 12 monthsin the mouse UDMH study and at 12 months in the rat UDMH study, with thepossibility that regulatory action could be taken on the basis of theseinterim data, rather than waiting until the studies were finished. In additionto oncogenicity studies, the Agency also required extensive other datasubmissions including mutagenicity data, plant and animal metabolism studies,livestock feeding data, crop field trials, degradation in food data, storagestability information, market basket surveys, and the development of moresensitive analytical methods.  The majority of the required data have been received and reviewed. Basedon this information, EPA has made a preliminary determination to proposecancellation of registrations of all products containing daminozide foruse on food and to retain non-food uses as currently registered. EPA'sposition and a summary of the rationale underlying that position are setforth in this Notice. The basis for the Agency's action is explained morefully in the Daminozide Special Review Technical Support Document. Copiesof the Technical Support Document are available upon request from the contactperson listed under <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>'' above. The Technical SupportDocument also contains references, background information, and other informationpertinent to the Special Review of products containing daminozide.  In addition, copies of a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel daminozide productsare also available from the contact person listed above. Preparation ofthe draft Notice of Intent to Cancel is required by 40 CFR 154.31(b)(1).The draft Notice is being forwarded to the SAP and the Secretary of Agricultureto permit their review of the Agency's proposed action. The draft Noticeof Intent to Cancel, along with the Daminozide Technical Support Documentand other notices and analyses prepared pursuant to 40 CFR 154.31, willbe sent to the sole registrant of pesticide products containing daminozide. The draft Notice of Intent to Cancel is not now legally effective, butis intended only to provide a basis for comment by the SAP, U.S. Departmentof Agriculture, the registrant, and the public. The draft Notice providesthat continued distribution or sale of daminozide products registered forfood uses will not be allowed after cancellation. Also, EPA will not allowthe continued use of such existing stocks of cancelled products. The draftNotice also discusses procedures for requesting a cancellation or denialhearing after issuance of a final notice of intent to cancel. Commentson the draft Notice of Intent to Cancel, this Notice, and the TechnicalSupport Document must be filed within 90 days of the issuance of this Notice.  <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Legal Background</ITAG>A. The Statute A pesticide product may be sold or distributed in the United States onlyif it is registered or exempt from registration under FIFRA as amended(7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.). Before a product can be registered it must be shownthat it can be used without ``unreasonable adverse effects on the environment''(FIFRA section 3(c)(5)), that is, without causing ``any reasonable riskto man or the environment, taking into account the economic, social, andenvironmental costs and benefits of the use of the pesticide'' (FIFRA section2(bb)). The burden of proving that a pesticide meets this standard for registrationis, at all times, on the proponent of initial or continued registration.If at any time the Agency determines that a pesticide no longer meets thisstandard for registration, then the Administrator may cancel this registrationunder section 6 of FIFRA. B. The Special Review Process The Special Review process, formerly called the Rebuttable PresumptionAgainst Registration (RPAR), is a mechanism by which the Agency collectsinformation on the risks and benefits associated with the uses of pesticidesto determine whether any use causes unreasonable adverse effects to humanhealth or the environment. The Special Review process is currently governedby 40 CFR Part 154. Through the Special Review process, the Agency: (1) Announces and describes the Agency's risk concerns regarding pesticidaluse based on certain risk criteria. (2) Establishes a public docket. (3) Proposes a regulatory decision. (4) Solicits comments from the public on the proposed decision and issuesconcerning the Special Review. (5) Responds to significant comments from the Secretary of Agricultureand the SAP. (6) Makes a final regulatory decision based on a balancing of risks andbenefits associated with a pesticide's use. Issuance of this Notice means that the Agency has assessed the potentialrisks and benefits associated with the food and non-food uses of pesticideproducts containing daminozide and that the Agency has preliminarily determinedthat the risks from daminozide outweigh the benefits of its continued useon food commodities. Further, the Agency has preliminarily determined thatthe benefits of use of daminozide on non-food commodities outweigh therisks of use. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Summary of Risk and Benefit Determinations </ITAG>A. Risk Concerns Based on information available to date, the Agency has determined thatthe adverse effect of primary concern from daminozide/UDMH exposure iscancer. An in-depth discussion of the historical data base supporting thisconclusion can be found in the Daminozide Technical Support Document. Since  issuing  the  Draft  PD 2\3/4\ in 1985, which detailed the then-existingdata base regarding the potential for daminozide and UDMH to cause cancer,the Agency has received additional studies and information to support theconclusion that daminozide and UDMH are carcinogenic. 1. Recently received oncogenicity information. EPA evaluated the tumorresponses seen in the completed daminozide studies, in which mice (CD-1)fed levels of 0, 300, 3,000, 6,000 and 10,000 ppm for 2 years and rats(Fischer 344) were fed levels of 0, 100, 500, 5,000, and 10,000 ppm for2 years (Uniroyal, 1988a; and Uniroyal, 1988b, respectively). Review ofthe daminozide mouse study indicates that there is a statistically significantincrease in hemangiosarcomas, and combined hemangiomas/hemangiosarcomas(benign and malignant blood vessel tumors, respectively) with increasingdose in males and females (by the Cochran Armitage test_a statistical recognitionof a positive increase in tumors with increasing dose) but not by pairwisecomparison (Fisher Exact test_statistical comparison of the control andtreated animals). In addition, combined benign and malignant alveolar/bronchiolartumors showed a dose-related trend in male mice as well as a significantpairwise difference between the 6,000 ppm dose and the controls in malesand females. The rate studies did not show a statistically significantincrease in tumors of any kind. Although not used for risk calculation,a complete discussion of the daminozide tumor response in the mouse studyhas been presented in the Daminozide Technical Support Document. Uniroyal is currently conducting 2-year UDMH drinking water oncogenicitystudies in the rat (Fischer 344) and mouse (CD-1). The Agency requiredthat Uniroyal submit interim sacrifice reports from the mouse and rat studiesin order to better characterize the formation of tumors and serve as abasis for regulatory action if the data warrant. In one study (Uniroyal, 1988c), groups of Fischer 344 rats (70 sex/dose)are being administered UDMH in drinking water at 0, 1, 50, and 100 ppmfor 2 years. The 1-year interim sacrifice (20 animals per sex/dose) datahas been submitted and reviewed by the Agency. Although there was a dose-relatedincrease in the incidence of corneal opacity in all treated female groups,there was no significant difference in the incidence of tumors in any dosegroup when compared to controls. The CD-1 mouse is currently being tested for oncogenic effects in two separatestudies at several dosage levels. In the first mouse study (Uniroyal, 1988d),UDMH was administered in water using low doses of 0, 1, 5, and 10 ppm UDMHin males and 0, 1, 5, and 20 ppm in females. The test used 90 animals persex per dose. Fifty animals per sex per dose were dosed for 2 years. Twentyanimals each were sacrificed at 8 months and 12 months from the initiationof the study. Although at 8 months some toxicity was observed in the liver,no apparent increase in tumors was seen. The liver toxicity noted was inthe form of brown pigment and hypertrophy of the liver in males at thehighest dose. The 12-month report did not show a significant increase intumor formation when comparing treated animals to controls. The terminalsacrifice of this study occurred in January 1989 and the final report ofthis study is due in September 1989. On March 19, 1987, EPA required Uniroyal to perform an additional oncogenicitystudy in mice. This action was taken because the Agency did not believethe maximum tolerated dose (MTD) would be achieved in the CD-1 mouse oncogenicitystudy with high doses of only 10 to 20 ppm. Uniroyal believed that theresults of a 13-week subchronic study (Cranmer, M. and Frith, C., 1987)supported the 20 ppm MTD for mice and that elevating the dose would threatenthe lives of the animals and the validity of the study. (Uniroyal's opinionwas based on: (1) Microscopic examination of liver, spleen and bone marrowwhich they believe suggested significant cellular alterations, (2) evaluationof hematological effects from which they suggested significant changeshad occurred to critical blood elements resulting in life-threatening anemia,and (3) changes in alkaline phosphatase levels which they considered tobe significant and which they correlated with histopathological changesin the liver.) The Agency considered this interpretation of the 13-weekdata but was not satisfied that the changes noted in the report were biologicallymeaningful. The Agency was of the opinion that the effects were not life-threateningin nature. EPA believed that higher doses were necessary and required theadditional carcinogenicity study at 0, 40, and 80 ppm dose levels.The second study in the CD-1 mouse is currently underway (Uniroyal, 1988e).Groups of 90 animals/sex/dose are being administered UDMH at 0, 40, and80 ppm. As with the low dose study, 20 animals/sex/dose were sacrificedat 8 and 12 months. The 8-month interim sacrifice report noted hematologicaleffects (dose-related increases in erythrocyte count, hematocrit and hemoglobinlevels when compared to controls) in high dose males, accentuation of liverlobulation in both dosage groups of males, liver cell hypertrophy, singlecell necrosis and bile pigment accumulation in liver of treated males aswell as increased bile pigment accumulation in the females. Increases inbenign lung tumors (alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas) in both sexes were reportedat 80 ppm.The 12-month interim sacrifice report showed the same toxicity effectsas reported in the 8-month sacrifice (liver lobulation, single cell necrosis,etc., in the males). In addition to these effects, there was an increasedincidence of vascular tumors of the liver in male and female mice and anincreased incidence of alveolar/bronchiolar tumors in the lungs of themale and female mice.As discussed later in this section, the cancer risk assessment and thebasis for Agency regulatory action is the tumor response seen at the 80ppm UDMH dose level in mice at 1 year. The blood vessel tumors seen inthis study are the same type of tumors seen in the earlier UDMH and daminozidestudies (Toth, 1977a; Toth, 1977b; Toth, 1973; Haun, 1984). The terminalsacrifice for this study is scheduled for mid-May 1989 and the final reportis due to EPA in January 1990. The incidence of vascular liver tumors isnoted in the following Table 1.<ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-M002</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert Illustration(s) 641-642</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 6560-50-C</ITAG>The Agency estimated an interim cancer potency factor for use in risk calculationbased on the data from the ``high dose'' UDMH mouse study. (Cancer potencyis a quantitative measure or estimate of the relationship between exposureto increasing doses of the chemical substance in question and the increasedseverity (e.g., number of tumors) of the carcinogenic effect.) The Agencyused the linearized multi-stage model to extrapolate from effects seenat high doses to predict tumor response at low doses. The actual calculationof the Q*<T2>1</T2> for UDMH is described in greater detail in the Daminozide TechnicalSupport Document.The Agency believes that data from the 1-year interim sacrifice of the``high dose'' UDMH mouse study are appropriate to use for estimating oncogenicpotency for the following reasons: (1) Hemangiosarcomas are uncommon malignanttumors and have a low background rate in the strain of mouse used; (2)hemangiosarcomas are the same type of tumors seen in the earlier UDMH anddaminozide studies; and (3) since malignant blood vessel tumors have alreadybeen noted at the 40 ppm dose level at the one year interim sacrifice,it is very likely that a dose-response relationship will be observed forthe occurrence of hemangiomas/hemangiosarcomas by the termination of theUDMH mouse study after two years. The daminozide mouse study was not usedfor potency estimation since no statistically significant increase in tumorsby pairwise comparison was noted in the study. In addition, because atthis stage the lung tumors have not yet been shown to be outside the normallyhigh incidence of lung tumors in CD-1 mice, for purposes of this documentthese tumors were not included in the interim potency estimation used inthe Preliminary Determination.Based on the incidence of the vascular tumors at 80 ppm UDMH after 1 yearof treatment, the Agency calculated an interim cancer potency factor of0.88 (milligrams/kilogram/day)<T3>-1</T3> ((mg/kg/day)<T3>-1</T3>) using the Crump Global 86 model. In addition, an interim Q*<T2>1</T2> of 2.9 (mg/kg/day)<T3>-1</T3> was calculated on the incidence of lung tumors seen in thissame study. As noted above, for purposes of this document, the Q*<T2>1</T2> calculated on the basis of the increased incidence of bloodvessel tumors alone was used in the risk estimates.Considered with the results of the earlier oncogenicity studies on daminozideand UDMH, which showed the same tumor types as the newer Uniroyal studies,the Agency has classified both daminozide and UDMH as Group B<T2>2</T2> chemicals, probably human carcinogens.2. <T3>Metabolism data. </T3>The Agency has recently received and reviewedthe results from a metabolism study in miniature swine (Uniroyal, 1987d).This study utilized Charles River miniature swine which were administeredapproximately 5 mg/kg (approximately 100 ppm) daminozide orally. Daminozidewas found in almost all tissues, at levels up to 73 ppb, with the liverand kidney containing the highest levels. Analysis of urine indicates thatboth UDMH and dimethyl nitrosamine (NDMA) were excreted in the urine. Fromthe urine analysis data, the Agency estimates that approximately 1 ppmaverage (or 1 percent) of daminozide was metabloized to UDMH. NDMA levelsranged from 0.01 to 0.69 ppm. However, the Agency believes that most ofthe UDMH and NDMA were excreted in the feces in the first 24 hours. Becausefecal data were not analyzed for the 0-24 hour portion of the study, analysisof urine and feces is considered incomplete. This study is described ingreater detail in the Daminozide Technical Support Document.3. <T3>Mutagenicity information.</T3> The Agency evaluated information concerningthe potential of daminozide and UDMH to cause mutagenic effects, or damageto the genetic material of cells. The results of several mutagenicity assayson daminozide tend to indicate that daminozide <T3>per se</T3> is not mutagenic. These studies are discussed in greaterdetail in the Daminozide Technical Support Document.Conflicting results for mutagenicity have been reported in several studiesfor UDMH, however. Uniroyal (Uniroyal, 1988g) has recently submitted reportsof several mutagenicity studies which were negative for mutagenic activity.Based solely on these studies, UDMH does not appear to be mutagenic.However, open literature reports of several studies with positive resultsfor UDMH provide a basis for a mutagenicity concern. These studies arediscussed in greater detail in the Technical Support Document.4. <T3>Exposure.</T3> A chemical's cancer potency is one of two componentsof cancer risk assessment. The other component is exposure. The Agencycalculated dietary exposure to daminozide and UDMH for the general population,nursing infants, non-nursing infants, and children aged 1 to 5 years, andnon-dietary exposure for mixers, loaders, and/or applicators exposed dermallyto daminozide and UDMH.a. <T3>Dietary exposure.</T3> Dietary exposure consists of two parts. First,the residue value, or the amount of daminozide and UDMH found or estimatedon raw and processed food, was estimated. Second, residue values were consideredin relation to food consumption patterns of differing age groups to determineexposure.1. <T3>Residue Estimates.</T3> Daminozide and UDMH residues were determinedfrom (1) market basket survey data, (2) data from controlled field trialsconducted in 1986 and 1987, and (3) estimates of residues in meat, eggs,and meat by-products based on livestock feeding studies.

The model for calculating dietary exposure is calledthe Tolerance Assessment System (TAS). Using TAS, the Agency determinedexposure profiles for several different age groups, including the U.S.population as a whole, nursing infants, non-nursing infants, and childrenaged 1 to 6 years old.The food consumption data files used to calculate dietary exposure werederived from a nationwide survey of individual food consumption patternsof 30,770 people, conducted by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)in 1977-1978 (White, et al., 1983). This survey, TAS, and the assumptionsconsidered when assessing dietary exposure are described in greater detailin the Daminozide Technical Support Document.Average daily consumption values from the USDA survey were multiplied byresidue information for each commodity. Residue information from crop fieldtrials was adjusted by percent of crop treated estimates. Residue datafrom the market basket survey were not adjusted for percent of crop treated.Multiplication of average daily consumption values and residue informationresults in the daily anticipated residue contribution (ARC) for each food-formand for the pesticide as a whole. The ARC represents the Agency's dietaryexposure estimate.The following Table 5 shows the average daily consumption, UDMH residue,and exposure values for each commodity containing residues of UDMH.

The Agency received a daminozide greenhouse worker exposure study in responseto the 1986 DCI Notice. However, this study was found to be deficient forseveral reasons which are further explained in the Daminozide TechnicalSupport Document. To calculate non-dietary exposure for workers who mix,load and/or apply daminozide, EPA used a recently reviewed study on exposureof greenhouse workers to acephate (Sumagic PGR) to assess non-dietary exposure.The Agency believes it appropriate to use acceptable surrogate data insteadof relying on the uncertain results of a more limited study when more suitableexposure data are not available for an exposure assessment. The surrogate study (Merricks, 1987) was based on the dermal exposure tonine workers as they filled the spray tank with pesticide, diluted thespray, and then sprayed the plants by hand in a 20andmin16; by 100andmin16;greenhouse to run-off. Dermal exposure was monitored using cellulose patchdosimeters placed on the shoulders, chest, back, head, forearms, upperarms, thighs, and shins. Further description of this study has been providedin the Technical Support Document. From this study, dermal exposure perpound active ingredient for mixer/loaders was calculated to be 87 mg/lba.i. and 74 mg/lb a.i. for applicators. The geometric mean (unit exposure)of these data sets was calculated to be 58 mg/lb a.i. and 59 mg/lb a.i.,respectively. Daminozide exposure and risk to mixers, loaders and applicators was calculatedfor typical application scenarios. The Agency used several assumptionsin its exposure calculations which are described in the Technical SupportDocument. The following calculation was used to estimate mixer/loader andapplicator exposure for UDMH: Average Daily UDMH Exposure (mg/kg/day)=Application Rateandmultiply;1A treated/applicationandmultiply;2applications/yearandmultiply;Unit Exposureandmultiply;1.00 UDMH absorbedandmultiply;0.00005UDMH in daminozideandmultiply;1/70 kgandmultiply;365 days/year</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where the Application Rate is 5.1 lb a.i./A for chrysanthemums and0.61 lb a.i./A for tomato transplants, and the Unit Exposure is 58 mg/lba.i. for mixer/loaders and 59 mg/lb a.i. for applicators. Dermal exposureestimates for mixer/loaders and applicators calculated using this equationis summarized in the following Table 9: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s50,12,12</C><T4>Table </T4>9._<T4>Average Daily Dermal Exposure to UDMH </T4><H1>Worker </H1><H1>Greenhouse tomatoes (mg/kg/day) </H1><H1>Greenhouse chrysanthemums (mg/kg/day)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Mixer/loader <D>1andmultiply;10</D>^7 <D>1andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Applicator <D>1andmultiply;10</D>^7 <D>1andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mixer/loader applicator <D>2andmultiply;10</D>^7 <D>2andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG></ITAG>5. <T3>Risk calculation. </T3>Although the previous section presented exposurevalues to both the parent compound, daminozide, and the metabolite, UDMH,cancer risk was calculated using the UDMH interim cancer potency factor.As noted previously, the Agency has not received the final results of theUniroyal UDMH carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats. Although the sametypes of tumors were observed in the daminozide mouse study (hemangiomas/hemangiosarcomas),only biological trends were observed. Therefore, no cancer potency factorwas calculated from the daminozide study. The Agency has identified UDMHas the primary chemical of oncogenic concern at this time. a. <T3>Dietary risks. </T3>The 95 percent upper bound lifetime increased cancerrisk for the general population was obtained by taking the interim UDMHQ*<T2>1</T2> (cancer potency factor) from the Dose-Response Assessment (0.88per mg/kg/day^1) and multiplying it by the exposure estimate found in Table5. Lifetime risk for non-nursing infants, the highest exposure group, wasobtained by taking the exposure value in Table 7 and multiplying it bythe cancer potency factor. This value was then divided by 70 average lifetimeyears. When calculating risk from exposure to UDMH, EPA separately calculatedmetabolic conversion from daminozide to UDMH. Based on the incomplete resultsof the miniature swine metabolism study described earlier in this Noticeand in the Technical Support Document, the Agency estimated that approximately1 percent of ingested daminozide is converted into UDMH in the gut. Anyconversion from daminozide to UDMH in apple, peanut and cherry productsdue to processing is assumed to be included in the residue estimates fromthe market basket survey.

Risk estimates posed by exposureto UDMH residues for individuals in different age subgroups are also lifetimerisks in that a tumor response can occur anytime the person's lifetime,but the level of exposure (and calculated risk) changes as a person growsolder and enters different age subgroups. Exposure estimates for infantsand children are higher than those of adults because consumption patternsvery and because infants consume more food (particularly certain fruit)per unit body weight than adults. Infants and children have greater relativeUDMH exposure than do adults and, therefore, may incur a substantial portionof lifetime risk during these exposure periods. Estimates of potentiallifetime carcinogenic risk posed by 1 year exposure to UDMH residues forthe general population and selected age subgroups is shown in the followingTable 11. <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s150,12,9</C><T4>Table</T4> 11._<T4>Estimates of Risks to Selected Age Subjects From One Year Exposureto UDMH</T4><H1>Subset (age and other)</H1><H1>Dietary exposure (mg/kg/day)</H1><H1>1-year exposure lifetime risk</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Nursing infants (andless;1 year old)<D>0.000229</D><D>2.9andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Non-nursing infants (andless;1 year old)<D>0.000410</D><D>5.2andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Children (1-6 years old)<D>0.000138</D><D>1.7andmultiply;10</D>^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Average 1-year risk for all age groups<D>0.000047</D><D>4.9andmultiply;10</D>^7</ITAG></ITAG>The dietary exposure values used for risk calculation, except for tomatoes,are found in Table 5. The exposure estimates for tomatoes used to calculaterisk are 10 times the value reported in Table 5. The Agency made this exposureadjustment to reflect exposure situations where the consumer grows andcans his own tomatoes, puree and/or juice. The exposure value in Table5 reflects a 10 percent-of-crop treated assumption. That value was derivedfrom usage estimates which show that 50 percent of the tomato transplantsintended for the home grower market are treated and no tomato transplantsused for commercially grown tomatoes are treated. The home garden marketaccounts for approximately 20 percent of the tomatoes consumed nationally(50 percentandmultiply;20 percent=ten percent of crop treated). This approachto calculating risk spreads total dietary risk over the entire populationand does not account for those situations where people grow their own marketsand can tomato products. For this reason, a range of risks from consumingtomatoes was calculated based on 10 percent-of-crop-treated and 100 percentof crop treated. Table 10 lists the dietary risk estimates from individualfood commodities.b. <T3>Non-dietary risks.</T3> The non-dietary exposure estimates discussedabove in Unit III.A.4.b. are used as a basis for estimating non-dietarycarcinogenic risk. The Agency assumed that the cancer potency factor forthe dermal route of exposure is equivalent to that for the dietary route(0.88 (mg/kg/day)^1 and that the length of lifetime exposure is 35 yearsworked/70 years lived.

Unlike pesticidesused to protect the existence of the crop, many of the biological benefitsof daminozide use are related to the appearance of the crops.There are no alternatives to daminozide that alone will accomplish allof the growth regulator benefits attributed to daminozide. For the principalapple varieties that have historically had the highest percent of croptreated with daminozide, there are no alternatives for the key biologicaleffects of use (i.e., Red Delicious_reduce watercore, improve storage andfruit color; Golden Delicious_improve storage; McIntosh_delay prematureripening, prevent fruit drop, improve fruit color and increase storagelife; Stayman_prevent splitting).The impact of cancellation of registrations for use on apples at 1988 usagelevels is estimated to be insignificant to the apple industry in the aggregate;the overall effect on all growers is estimated to be an increase of $1.5million annually in income. Growers of certain varieties, particularlyEastern McIntosh and Stayman, may be most adversely affected. Growers ofthese two varieties which use daminozide are estimated to have annual incomelosses of $5.68 and $1.82 million, respectively, and may have a greaterthan 30 percent reduction in total revenues per treated acre; some growersmay not be able to stay in business or may need to replant to other applevarieties or crops over time. Non-users of daminozide may experience asignificant gain in income from higher market apple prices.A cancellation of daminozide is expected to reduce the supply of freshapples by 160 million lbs (annual U.S. production is 8 billion lbs) andapples available for processing may increase by 47.7 million lbs. Thesechanges are estimated to result in a corresponding 3 percent price increaseand a 2 percent price decrease for fresh and processed apple products,respectively.The net social cost (total society cost) based on 10 percent of the croptreated is estimated to range from $18 to $81 million as compared to $44to $198 million for 1985 usage levels. (The 10 percent estimate is higherthan the earlier 1989 estimate, discussed in conjunction with the appletolerance extension <T4>Federal Register </T4>Notice (54 FR 6392; February 10, 1989), whichwere 4 to 8 percent. The increase in the usage estimates is from additionaland more in-depth use information gathered in February and March 1989.)The Agency expects the net social cost will be closer to the lower endof the presented ranges because of the large transfer payments expectedbetween the farm and retail markets.For the remaining food crops (grapes, sweet and tart cherries, pears, peaches,nectarines, and peanuts), grower level economic impacts of a cancellationbased on 1988 usage estimates are estimated to be negligible except forpeach/nectarine growers who could suffer a minor $1.5 to $5.5 million lossof income. Based on 1985 usage estimates, annual grower level impacts maybe minor for all crops except sweet cherries, which are estimated to benegligible. Annual income losses for these crops were estimated as: grapes_$2.4million; peaches/nectarines_$1.5 to $5.5 million; pears_andless;$500,000;and peanuts_$2.0 million.Economic impacts of a daminozide cancellation upon consumers for non-applefood crops at 1988 usage levels is estimated to be negligible. Based on1985 usage levels, consumer impacts are estimated to be negligible forsweet and tart cherries, peaches/nectarines, pears, and peanuts. However,grape consumers may experience a 1 to 5 percent price increase and a 2to 4 percent reduction in the marketed qualtity, which is minor.Tomato growers may suffer income losses from reduced crop quality. Consumersmay experience higher prices and lower quality plants based on 1985 and1988 usage data.If the use of daminozide on ornamentals and bedding plants were cancelled,both users and consumers could be significantly affected. Based on 1985and 1988 usage data (90 percent of chrysanthemums and 50 percent of beddingplants are treated), users might suffer cost increases from $700,000 to$4.7 million. Accordingly, consumers could expect to pay higher pricesfor lower quality plants.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Regulatory Options</ITAG>The Agency has concluded that, when daminozide is used as currently registered,the combined dietary risk from all daminozide treated food crops outweighsthe benefits based on either 1988 or 1985 usage levels. Therefore, thepurpose of evaluating regulatory options is to determine if there are modificationsin the terms and conditions of use that would result in benefits outweighingrisks for some or all uses. The specific regulatory options consideredand the resultant reduction in exposure and risk are discussed in thisunit. A. Apples<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Reducing Application Rate and Increasing Pre-Harvest Intervals.</ITAG>Reducing application rates can, in general, be a practical action for reducingexposure. The use rate on apples was reduced in 1986 as an interim exposurereduction measure and further reductions would adversely affect the efficacyof daminozide. Since daminozide is a systemic growth regulator and is incorporatedinto the flesh of the fruit, EPA believes that increasing the pre-harvestinterval would not generate a significant reduction in the level of daminozideand UDMH residues present in the fruit.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Reducing UDMH Exposure From Applies, Apple Sauce and Juice, andApple Pomace Used in Animal Feed.</ITAG>With apples accounting for the majority of daminozide's use, any meaningfuldietary exposure reduction would have to come from lower UDMH residuesin raw apples, apple products, and apple pomace used as cattle feed. Thirty-threepercent of UDMH exposure comes from residues found in fresh apples (2 percent)and apple products (31 percent). The Agency estimates that cancer risksbased on dietary exposure to apple products alone would be sufficient towarrant consideration of regulatory action. Theoretical residues in milk(42 percent) and meat (9 percent) account for 51 percent of UDMH's estimateddietary exposure used in calculating risk. Although no actual market basketresidues have been found in milk, meat, poultry or eggs, residues are possiblebecause data from feeding studies show that daminozide and UDMH residuesdo transfer from apple pomace as well as from other daminozide treatedfoods that are fed to cattle such as grape pomace, and peanut byproducts.Two possible modifications to apple use were evaluated. Prohibiting useon apples used in processing would theoretically eliminate UDMH residuesin apple sauce and juice and residues in animal and cattle feed from applepomace by almost 90 percent (assuming other animal feeds, such as peanutby-products, were also eliminated). This restriction would lower dietaryrisk to almost 10 ^6, but the Agency still believes that the risks outweighbenefits. Limiting use to certain varieties could also further reduce exposure.In particular, the Agency looked at limiting use to McIntosh and Staymanapples intended for the fresh market. Both varieties are widely marketedas fresh apples and the Agency estimates that growers of these varietieswould suffer the biggest economic losses from the cancellation of daminozide.The McIntosh and Stayman varieties account for approximately 15 percentof total apple treatments. A rough estimate of the UDMH dietary contributionfrom fresh McIntosh and Stayman apples is 0.3 percent of the total apple/appleproduct contribution (2 percent UDMH from all fresh apples andmultiply;15percent of fresh apples that are McIntosh and Stayman). The total riskcontribution from McIntosh and Stayman fresh apples is approximately 4andmultiply;10^8(1.35andmultiply;10^5 risk from all fresh apples and apple products andmultiply;0.3percent, the percentage of exposure from these two varieties).While such a reduction in risk would appear to warrant reconsiderationof the risk/benefit assessment, as a practical matter, the Agency doesnot believe it can reasonably ensure that use will be confined to thesevarieties, or to apples that are not processed. Many users grow more thanone variety and virtually all growers hope to be able to sell as much oftheir harvest as possible in the fresh market where prices are significantlyhigher. Rejected apples, often treated, are then sold for processing. Daminozideproducts have a caution included on the label since 1986 warning growersnot to treat apples intended for processing. However, the high number ofpositive samples for apple sauce and juice as seen in recent surveys, suchas those conducted by Consumers Union (``Consumer Reports'', May 1988)show that treated apples are being used in processed apple products. [ConsumersUnion reported in the May, 1989, issue that 23 out of 31 (71 percent) adultapple juice samples contained daminozide residues above the 0.02 ppm detectionlimit of the analytical method and an overall average residue of 0.11 ppm.]As a note, however, the high number of positve samples in the ConsumersUnion report may be in part a result of the sampling area, New York City,where McIntosh and Stayman apples are more likely to be incorporated intoprocessed apple products. Carryover in trees sprayed in previous yearsmay also account for some of the positive samples.Thus, although there are very restrictive use limitations that could theoreticallyresult in significantly reduced risks, the Agency does not believe thatfor daminozide use on apples, a practical, enforceable way of ensuringadherence to these limited use restrictions can be achieved.B. Peanuts and CherriesBecause apples account for such a large percentage of daminozide's use,cancellation of daminozide use on peanuts and/or cherries alone, the twofood commodities with the highest exposure contribution after apples (notincluding theoretical residues in meat and milk), would have little effecton total dietary risk. Risk would be reduced from 4.1andmultiply;10^5 to3.7andmultiply;10^5. Benefits are estimated to be minor for peanuts ($2.0million in net income loss to growers; andless;1 percent of total peanutfarm income) and minor to negligible for cherries (sweet cherries, negligible;tart cherries, $2.2 million in net income loss) based on 1985 data. Basedon 1988 usage, grower and consumer losses are estimated to be negligible.Even if apples were cancelled, the remaining risk from peanuts (1.6andmultiply;10^6)and cherries (2.4andmultiply;10^6) both exceed the estimated benefits andcancellation is being proposed.C. Grapes, Pear, Peaches/Nectarines, and TomatoesCancellation of daminozide on any or all of these crops would not appreciablyaffect total dietary risk or aggregate benefits related to daminozide use.Individual dietary risk from exposure for these crops is presented below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s50,18 </C>  <H1>Commodity </H1><H1>Dietary risk</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Tomatoes <D>9.3</D>andmultiply;10^7-9.3andmultiply;10^6</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Grapes <D>2.3</D>andmultiply;10^7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Peaches <D>1.1</D>andmultiply;10^7</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Pears <D>4.3</D>andmultiply;10^8</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nectarines <D>8.8</D>andmultiply;10^9</ITAG></ITAG>Total dietary risk from exposure to these crops is approximately 1andmultiply;10^6(using the low end of the tomato risk range). These risks are based on1988 percent of crop treated and therefore reflect the lower end of therisk range. If usage returned to 1985 levels, the risks from dietary exposurewould increase but it would still be likely that most individual crop riskswould be below 10^6.Impacts on growers and consumers of sweet and tart cherries, peaches, pears,nectarines, peanuts and grapes would be minor or negligible based on 1985or 1988 usage. There may even be various intangible benefits to the growerfrom renewed consumer confidence supported by the fact that daminozideand UDMH residues would no longer be present in the marketplace. Althoughthe dietary risk from exposure to peanuts, grapes, pears, and peaches/nectarinesis small, the Agency has concluded that these risks outweigh the negligibleto minor benefits and cancellation is being proposed.Although an estimated 50 percent of tomato transplants grown for home gardenuse are reportedly treated with daminozide, quantitative economic impactscould not be calculated because of a lack of specific data. Loss of daminozideon tomato transplants would result in ``lower quality'' plants and higherprices to the consumer with a loss of crop quality and subsequent incometo the grower based on either 1985 or 1988 usage data. In balancing therisks and benefits of daminozide use on tomatoes, the Agency was particularlyconcerned about home gardeners whose source of fresh tomatoes and tomatoproducts may be totally from treated plants. The 20 percent of tomatoesgrown by home gardeners likely represents the highest percentage of homegrown versus commercially grown crop of the major food commodities. TheAgency believes a significant portion of the population, particularly inwarmer geographic regions where tomatoes can be easily grown, may be experiencingrisks closer to the upper end of the risk range. Further, the risk rangefor tomatoes was based on ``average'' consumption patterns. It is possiblethat people who can tomato products are likely to eat more tomato productsthan those who do not. The Agency has therefore concluded that the risksof 9andmultiply;10^7 to 9andmultiply;10^6 (1988 or 1985 usage estimates) outweighthe benefits and is proposing cancellation of use on tomato transplants.The Agency recognizes that, in some instances where significant benefitshave been demonstrated or assumed, it has considered risks of the magnitudeestimated for these minor uses sufficiently negligible to forego regulatoryaction (see, e.g., ``Delaney Paradox'', 53 FR 41104, October 19, 1988).However, the Agency's current assessment of the benefits related to theseminor uses indicates that they are so insignificant as to be trivial. Accordingly,given some level of risk and almost no benefit, the risk/benefit balanceshifts in favor of cancellation. The Agency acknowledges that more dataon the economic impacts of daminozide use on tomatoes are needed and isrequesting information during the public comment period.D. Ornamentals and Bedding PlantsWith regard to the use of daminozide on ornamentals and bedding plants,the Agency estimated the greatest individual lifetime cancer risks posedby non-dietary exposure to UDMH from use on greenhouse ornamentals to be1andmultiply;10^6. In addition, the Agency believes that annual grower andconsumer losses (as high as $4.7 million in an industry with an annualwholesale value of $78.5 to $104.5 million) would be substantial if thegreenhouse uses of daminozide on ornamentals were cancelled. Therefore,the Agency believes that the benefits of continued use outweigh the carcinogenicrisks for non-dietary use of daminozide on ornamentals and bedding plantsand is proposing to continue the registration of these uses.E. Conclusions and Proposed Regulatory Actions The Agency has concluded that all food uses of daminozide should be cancelledbecause the resultant risk from dietary exposure to daminozide and/or itsmetabolite, UDMH, outweigh the benefits of continued use of each food commodity.EPA has also determined that the benefits outweigh the risks for the non-fooduses of daminozide and that all registrations for use on ornamentals andother uses on non-food bedding plants should be retained without modificationsin the label. In a related action, the Agency will also propose in the near future torevoke the daminozide tolerances for all raw agricultural commodities aswell as the daminozide food and feed additive regulations for processedcommodities. F. Existing Stocks Pursuant to FIFRA section 6(a)(1), ``the Administrator may permit the continuedsale and use of existing stocks of a pesticide whose registration is cancelled[pursuant to section 6 of FIFRA] to such extent, under such conditions,and for such uses as he may specify, if he determines that such sale oruse is not inconsistent with the purposes of [FIFRA] and will not haveunreasonable adverse effects on the environment.'' For purposes of thisaction, EPA defines the term ``existing stocks'' as any quantity of daminozideproducts subject to this Notice that: (1) is the United States, (2) was formulated, packaged, and labelled for use on the date of publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of this Notice, and (3) is being held for shipment or release or was shipped and released intocommerce prior to the date on which the registration of the product iscancelled pursuant to this Notice. The Agency has determined that no further shipment, distribution, saleor use of existing stocks of daminozide products labelled for cancelleduses will be permitted after the effective date of cancellation. In additionto daminozide products in channels of trade, this existing stocks prohibitionis applicable to daminozide products in the hands of end users. The Agencymade this determination based on several factors. First, daminozide isa systemic pesticide that remains in plants for a considerable time afterapplication and may result in residues in subsequent harvests. In addition,much of daminozide use is on crops for processed foods that can remainin the market system for long periods of time. In both of these instances,allowing use of existing stocks would effectively extend potential exposurewell beyond the final use season_an option that the Agency believes willresult in unreasonable adverse effects on human health. Finally, becauseof the extensive regulatory history leading to the cancellation of daminozide,users will have ample time to prepare themselves for this eventuality byexploring alternative options, including discontinuance of daminozide use.Accordingly, after May 24, 1989, no person who is a registrant or producerof a product subject to this Notice may release for shipment existing stocksof any product whose registration is cancelled or denied by this actionor no persons may distribute, sell, offer for sale, hold for sale, ship,deliver for shipment, or receive and (having so received) deliver or offerto deliver existing stocks of products whose registration is cancelledby this action. EPA has found this disposition of existing stocks to beconsistent with the purposes of FIFRA. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Procedural Matters </ITAG>As required by FIFRA sections 6(b) and 25(d), and 40 CFR 154.31(b), EPAhas transmitted copies of a draft Notice of Intent to Cancel consistentwith this Notice, together with support documents, to the Secretary ofAgriculture and the Scientific Advisory Panel for comment. EPA will publishany comments received from the Secretary or the Panel, and EPA's responses,in the Notice of Final Determination. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI.
