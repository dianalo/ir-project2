Jacobs, editor of the National Electronic DistributorsAssociation's NEDA Market Letter, notes that &quot;the pervasive cautious mind-setthroughout most of the industry for over a year has caused increasedhand-to-mouth procurement and inventory contraction.&quot;andM;At the conclusion of the war, &quot;the electronics industry will bewell-positioned for growth, what with inventories lean and the new productcycle coming fully of age,&quot; says Jacobs, who heads R.A.andP;  Jacobs Associates,New York-based consultants to the electronic components industry.andM;Electronic Buyers' News, which prepares the QUEST Index report is publishedby CMP Publications Inc., Manhasset, NY.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
