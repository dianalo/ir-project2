 The market has undergone a steady barrage of newtechnology, but the direction for the '90s is clear: the move to adistributed computing environment (DCE).andP;  In search of such a solution andheeding users' demands, former antagonists are cooperating to create andadopt a solid technology foundation for enterprise networks.andM;Unlike the enterprise network marketplace, which has several contenders forleadership, the PC LAN market still has one clear leader: Novell.andP;  Novell hasa solid base in the small business and department market, and is steadilybuilding itself up to become an integral component in enterprise networks.andO;&quot;Component&quot; indicates an important distinction.andP;  Novell is not seeking tobecome the enterprise backbone itself.andP;  The company sees itself functioningas an integrating platform, a way of bringing LANs in to the enterpriseenvironment of a given user's choice (Illustration 1).andP;  This approachdictates Novell's development targets and priorities for the foreseeablefuture.andM;Furthermore, Novell's approach is pragmatic rather than dogmatic.andP;  Thecompany appears to be completely ecumenical in its support for the variousenterprise environments.andP;  Although it is delivering support for IBM's SystemsNetwork Architecture (SNA) first, Novell will either develop the appropriatesoftware or work with third parties to do the same for other environments.andO;Not even the potentially thorny Open Software Foundation (OSF) DCE versus SunOpen Network Computing (ONC) decision ruffles Novell's aplomb.andP;  Novell willwork to provide whatever the market requires.andM;It is easier, of course, to rely upon pragmatism when you have a large baseof satisfied users pressing your cause.andP;  Users have pushed their enterprisesystems vendors to incorporate better support for their existing Novellnetworks.andP;  This has resulted in a growing number of agreements, such as thatbetween HP and Novell, for NetWare support in environments where LAN Manageris nominally the strategic platform.andM;Novell is building this integrating platform on top of NetWare 386, withPortable NetWare tracking slightly behind.andP;  (Although the next release ofPortable should map to Version 3.1 of NetWare 386, Novell is more in controlof 386 as third parties are integral to the delivery of Portable.)andP;  In thisreport, we are focusing on NetWare 386 rather than Portable NetWare orNetWare 286.andM;With its strategic decision to pursue enterprise integration in this way,Novell has stratified its product line.andP;  NetWare 286 becomes the solution forsmall business, workgroups, and small departments.andP;  NetWare 386 and PortableNetWare become the solutions for large corporate environments and formicro-to-host connectivity.andP;  (While such a stratification makes senseconceptually, there is one problem: The building blocks of the enterpriseLANs will, in many cases, be the workgroup and departmental LANs.andP;  Novellmust provide a clean migration path to NetWare 386 for its large installedbase of NetWare 286 users.)andM;Novell's integration technology basically consists of three broad areas oftechnology: the underlying NetWare &quot;primitives&quot;; a set of services (&quot;the fourbasic food groups of sharing,&quot; according to Novell VP Darrell Miller); and aset of bridging software linking the NetWare &quot;protocol engine&quot; to a varietyof enterprise environments.andP;  The bridging software will come from Novell aswell as third parties.andM;Novell's goal is to enable transparent connection from a variety of clientsto a variety of servers, using native networking software where available.andO;Given its position in the PC LAN market, Novell assumes, not unreasonably,that IPX/SPX will be the appropriate DOS protocols.andP;  For the Mac, Novell willsupport AppleTalk, and for Unix, TCP/IP.andP;  OS/2 is still a bit open.andM;To realize this goal, Novell is concentrating on six areas:andM;* A &quot;server&quot; operating system (NetWare 386)andM;* File and print servicesandM;* Standards-based open API/Development tools for server-based applications(Network Loadable Modules, or NLMs)andM;* Communications servicesandM;* Transparent connectivity to heterogeneous client environments and serviceprotocols (the &quot;Protocol Engine&quot;)andM;* Network management and administrationandM;Core NetWare 386andM;The NetWare operating system is now in its eighth generation.andP;  (Although itsupports DOS clients, NetWare is not a DOS-based system.)andP;  One of NetWare'sinitial distinctions was its high-performance file system.andP;  During the yearsfollowing its first introduction, Novell has steadily enhanced performanceand capabilities, with particular attention to data integrity.andP;  It firstintroduced the System Fault Tolerance (SFT) hot fix, disk-mirroring, andTransaction Tracking System (TTS) in 1986.andM;NetWare 386 offers a full 32-bit flat memory model, high-speed&quot;real-time-like&quot; multitasking, and nonpreemptive scheduling, all without theoverhead of a client-side or general purpose operating system.andP;  NetWare'spurpose in life is to run servers.andP;  Critical code paths in NetWare 386 arevery short, and the management of threads, memory, and other core OS servicesare optimized for a server environment.andP;  Among the core services NetWare 386offers are NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) support, memory management,thread-executing and scheduling primitives, security management, queuemanagement, communication services, resource-allocation tracking, eventnotification system, file system services, NetWare Name Service (NNS),security service, and management services.andM;NETWARE LOADABLE MODULE (NLM) SUPPORT.andP;  NLMs are server applications thatexpand or enhance the functions offered by servers.andP;  They are building blocksfor advanced functionality.andP;  (See Illustration 2.)andP;  For example, the core ofthe new Communications Services (described below) is a set ofNovell-developed NLMs.andP;  NLMs can be loaded or unloaded from file servermemory while the file server is running.andP;  They may sound a bit like the VAPs(Value-Added Processes) of NetWare 2.1x, but they are not.andP;  NetWare 2.1xcan't run NLMs; NetWare 386 can't run VAPs.andM;VAPs become part of the system only at boot time, in contrast to the NLMs.andO;Unlike VAPs, NLMs can communicate with one another.andP;  And, also unlike VAPS,NLMs do not need a connection as a virtual user to be able to utilizeworkstation resources.andP;  NLMs can also auto-load other NLMs (a new featurewith Version 3.1), and can specify a list of other NLMs that must be loadedbefore they can load.andP;  If the required modules are not already in memory, theserver will attempt to load them automatically.andP;  NLMs use a procedure callAPI for communication with core services and with other NLMs.andM;The net (pardon the pun) of this is an amazing degree of flexibility.andP;  Italso creates a great deal of opportunity for third-party developers.andP;  (Wanguses NLMs to deliver its Open Image system on NetWare, for example.)andM;NetWare accepts NLMs as equal partners at the heart of the OS, allowing themto function as fast as the OS core.andP;  But by permitting this existence at Ring0, Novell opened itself up to criticism.andP;  Microsoft, for example, insiststhat only the kernel of the OS should live at Ring 0, and that all otherservices should be managed by the kernel and live at Ring 3.andP;  Thealternative, it asserts, is the possibility of system crashes, subornedoperating systems, and inadvertent trashing of the server.andM;Although such dire consequences could theoretically occur, Novell has takensteps to reduce the possibility.andP;  First, third-party developers must submitNLMs to a Novell NLM Certification program.andP;  Second, Novell offers softwareto allow NLMs to run at Ring 3 (albeit with lesser performance) until the NLMis certified or tested.andP;  The certification program is pricey andtime-consuming.andP;  It also requires third parties to open up the kimono, as itwere, and expose a great deal of their source code.andP;  (For more on the Ring 0controversy, see Vol.andP;  5, No.andP;  2) Nevertheless, Novell has produced hundredsof NLMs by now, and is being joined by a growing number of third parties.andM;MEMORY MANAGEMENT.andP;  All memory not being used for other purposes is given tothe file cache system for use as a cache buffer.andP;  Correspondingly, NetWareremoves memory from the file cache system when it needs it elsewhere forother purposes, and then returns it.andP;  This is an essential support mechanismfor loading and unloading NLMs.andP;  It also comes in handy in mounting ordismounting file volumes.andM;THREAD-EXECUTING AND SCHEDULING PRIMITIVES.andP;  NetWare is a multithreadedoperating system that offers fast, lightweight threads.andP;  A task switch takes15 instructions, 3 of which are for new consistency checking.andP;  NetWarescheduling is nonpreemptive; the highest priority tasks run to completion.andO;This minimizes the context-switch overhead and also minimizes the shared datasynchronization overhead.andP;  Threads share a common memory address space.andO;NetWare maintains a pool of service processes, allowing for the scaling to alarge number of clients without requiring correspondingly large numbers ofprocesses.andM;DYNAMIC CONFIGURATION.andP;  NetWare 386 systems configure themselves based on anumber of factors: memory usage, directory caching, number of volumedirectory entries, the size of the open file table, routing buffers, TurboFAT indexing, service processes, and Active TTS transactions.andP;  Administratorscan alter limits and maximum values.andP;  The limits constrain dynamicconfiguration both by the speed with which the self-configuration occurs andby the maximum amount of resource that will be used.andP;  NLMs can now set newparameters for configuration.andM;SECURITY MANAGEMENT.andP;  NetWare uses its object-oriented Bindery as a securitydatabase.andP;  The Bindery maintains user and group information, stores accountrestriction information, stores password authentication information, andsupports the fast deletion of users and groups.andP;  NetWare also encryptspasswords.andP;  (This is not the same encryption technique provided in theNetWare Name Service.andP;  NNS uses RSA Data Security's public key encryptiontechnology.)andM;NetWare provides account restrictions (required password change at intervals,prevention of reuse of older passwords, specified time intervals during aweek when a specified user has access to specified services).andM;QUEUE MANAGEMENT.andP;  NetWare maintains access control security by queue forclients, servers, and operators.andP;  Clients can submit jobs to the queue, andcan delete or alter the status of the jobs they submit.andP;  Servers can retrievejobs from the queue.andP;  Operators can delete or alter the status of any job inthe queue.andM;COMMUNICATION SERVICES.andP;  The core Communication Services provided in NetWareare the foundation of the &quot;Protocol Engine&quot; and consist of three mainelements: the Open DataLink Interface (ODI), Streams, and Transport APIs.andM;The ODI supports IPX, TCP/IP, AppleTalk, and ISO transport protocols in theserver.andP;  NetWare also supports multiple service protocols: NetWare CoreProtocol (NCP); Apple File Protocol (AFP); Network File System (NFS); andFile Transfer, Access, and Management (FTAM).andM;ODI routes incoming packets to the correct protocol stack, and allowsmultiple protocol stacks to transmit using the same board.andP;  ODI, essentially,is Novell's answer to the Microsoft Network Driver Interface Specification(NDIS).andP;  ODI consists of three layers: the Link Support Layer (LSL), theMultiple Protocol Interface (MPI), and the Multiple Link Interface (MLI).andO;Novell likens the LSL interface to a traffic cop who routes network trafficbetween protocols, adapters, and the appropriate drivers.andP;  Both NDIS and ODIprovide ways for binding network drivers and protocols together.andP;  In theinitial implementation of NDIS, however, the two modules (drivers andprotocols) are bound directly together, forcing a reboot to load new protocolstacks.andP;  (3Com altered this in its implementation of NDIS to create theDemand Protocol Architecture.)andP;  In ODI, however, the two modules bind to theLSL.andP;  This allows the loading and unloading of protocol stacks withoutrebooting.andM;Novell uses the Unix Streams architecture to allow communication modules toconnect together dynamically at run-time.andP;  (Novell Streams is based on UnixSystem V Release 3.)andP;  Streams is basically similar to a C library thatprovides a variety of communication services for protocol developers.andO;(Novell is trying to position Streams primarily as a platform for protocoldevelopment, although you can use Streams for other things as well, such asdata filtering.andP;  Streams allows NetWare to support a variety of protocolenvironments.andP;  Currently, in NetWare 386, SPX/IPX, TCP/IP and ADSP/AppleTalk,Streams protocols are available.andP;  (See Illustration 3.)andP;  Although there is alow-level Streams interface, TLI is the preferred Streams API.andM;NetWare 386 offers TLI, Sockets, and IPX/SPX as transport APIs.andP;  Support forNamed Pipes and NetBIOS should be coming soon.andM;TRACKING OF RESOURCE ALLOCATIONS.andP;  Resource-allocation tracking (a newfeature in 3.1) provides statistical information about resource usage, suchas what a resource is being used for and how much of it is being used.andP;  Italso recovers resources that an NLM does not return after it completes itsfunction.andM;EVENT NOTIFICATION SYSTEM.andP;  Another new feature of 3.1, event notification,generates notices when events occur.andP;  Events can include the downing of aserver, exiting to DOS, a volume mount or dismount, and so on.andP;  NLMs canresiter to receive events.andP;  Upon the occurrence of an event, the registeredcall-back routine occurs.andP;  One result of this is that the file server cangenerate alert notices when a volume is getting full, when memory is gettinglow, or when a disk block was hot-fixed, among other things.andM;FILE SYSTEM SERVICES.andP;  Novell has always had a deserved reputation foroffering high-performance file services.andP;  NetWare 386 carries on thistradition.andP;  We can divide the features of the file system into four maincategories: performance, security, integrity, and multi-client support.andM;Performance.andP;  NetWare 386 offers a huge amount of online storage--up to 32terabytes.andP;  The actual physical limit is determined by the amount of RAMavailable for the File Allocation Table (FAT) and directory-caching.andP;  Novellhas reduced the amount of memory required for the directory hash by 7/8.andP;  Thefile system can mount up to 64 volumes simultaneously, and those volumes cnaspan multiple physical disk drives.andP;  Furthermore, you can increase the sizeof a volume dynamically by adding a new disk drive.andP;  The size of the volumeincreases while the volume is mounted and in use.andP;  To speed up thevolume-mounting itself, Novell has reduced the number of disk reads requiredfor a mount and increased the amount of data being concurrently pre-read.andM;NetWare 386 file volumes can contain some two million directories/files pervolume, and a file can be up to 4GB in size.andP;  A volume can support 100,000concurrent open files.andP;  NetWare 386 dynamically allocates directory entriesas needed.andM;Directory-and file-caching provide high-speed data access.andP;  A workstationfile read request can be serviced from a file cache in only 400 instructionsplus the LAN driver instructions.andP;  (Novell's NE3200LAN driver adds only 40instructions to this.)andP;  NetWare hashes the directories and file names forfaster access.andP;  To maximize the use of the disk channel bandwidth, NetWarescatters file data allocation blocks across all drives.andM;Security.andP;  The file service offers basic security.andP;  File trustee rightscontrol data access by directory and/or file.andP;  Individual users as well asgroups can control these rights.andP;  Each access right can be individuallygranted or revoked.andP;  New rights can be explicitly granted to the file orsubdirectory.andM;Integrity.andP;  Novell has made data integrity a high priority during the pastfew years.andP;  Such capability is necessary, Novell reasons correctly, if usersare to stage strategic applications on LANs.andP;  In NetWare 386, Novell offers asalvageable file system that allows the recovery of deleted files.andP;  Theadministrator can specify the minimum amount of time that a deleted file mustbe kept recoverable.andP;  NetWare will keep all the deleted files until thevolume runs out of disk space, and then will begin discarding the oldest ofthose deleted files.andM;Users with the appropriate rights can locate and salvage a deleted file byname, by the date of last modification, by the user who last modified thefile, by the deletion date and time, and by the user that deleted the file.andO;Although deleted files stay in their original directory, Novell keeps thedeleted file entries in a separate directory block to minimize theperformance hit on directory searches.andP;  Should a user delete an entiredirectory, NetWare moves the deleted files to a hidden directory.andP;  Users alsocan purge deleted files, rather than have them hang around.andM;Novell offers all of its System Fault Tolerance (SFT) capabilities withNetWare 386, thereby providing disk mirroring (up to eight disks), diskduplexing, the transaction tracking system (TTS), and the &quot;hot fix.&quot;andP;  NetWare386 3.1 offers SFT III, which provides full server mirroring as well.andM;The TTS provides transaction integrity.andP;  Should a transaction not be writtenentirely, TTS backs it out.andP;  TTS works across all files on a server that areflagged as transaction tracked.andP;  TTS uses the file cache system, and does notdelay the application while it writes complete to the disk.andM;Multi-Client File Service Support.andP;  One of the most intriguing and importantfeatures in the new NetWare 386 is the support for multiple file namespaces.andO;This feature, comparable to what Banan hopes to deliver next year (see Vol.andO;5, No.andP;  8), allows different workstation and host operating systems to sharefile data.andP;  Each client, in other words, sees the file name in its own nativeterms.andP;  A DOS user sees an 8.3 name; a Mac user sees whatever multiple wordname he or she has created (see Illustration 4).andP;  Novell has implemented thisto the point where two different clients can access the same file throughtheir native names, and access and modify different records within that fileat the same time.andM;Support for multi-client services, which heralds the beginning of what Novellcalls its Universal File Service, is certainly not a trivial exercise, giventhe way the different operating systems handle files.andP;  NetWare maintains allthe attributes appropriate to a file for a given client in a layer atop thefile system.andM;The APIs offered as part of the service are storage-media-independent,offering transparent support for CD-ROM, WORM, and removable media.andP;  Opticaljukebox support is also possible, opening up the possibility of network-basedimaging applications.andP;  (Wang, for one, is developing an Open/Image NLMs forjukebox and image services.)andP;  The APIs can also provide disk information andaccess for non-NetWare file systems.andM;NetWare 386 3.1 will be able to function as an NFS File server, to supportMacintosh through the use of AFP, and to offer support for OSI FTAM Services.andM;NETWARE NAME SERVICE (NNS).andP;  Novell's new NetWare Name Service (NNS) uses asingle directory databse that contains administrator-specified domains andprofiles.andP;  Domains are groups of up to 400 servers.andP;  Profiles are lists oflogical, task-oriented subsets of servers in a domain, of users who can usethe profile, and of a profile log-in script.andP;  A profile can contain up toeight servers.andM;When a manager adds a server to a domain, the server inherits all printerdefinitions and all name service database information from the other serversin that domain.andM;Novell built the Name Service on top of the NetWare Bindery, a database foundin all versions of NetWare.andP;  NNS creates a name service databse, which isthen distributed to all servers in the network.andP;  The name database is fullyreplicated to every server, where it can perform any needed userauthentication.andP;  Utility software broadcasts any changes to the name databaseto all copies throughout the network.andP;  Any changes must be made by theadministrator within Netcon, the utility package.andP;  Exiting the packagetriggers the broadcast and update.andM;If a server is down, Netcon logs an error message, which is also distributedto all servers.andP;  Administrators can later run an update process that runsagainst the error logs.andM;Novell draws a distinction between a naming service and a directory service.andO;A directory service, in Novell's view, affects security, and so is left tothe individual servers on the network.andP;  NNS is not a global directoryservice.andP;  Version 3.1 does provide NNS integration with the file, printcommunications and management services, however.andM;NNS offers neither a lookup service nor the degree of location transparencyprovided by other vendors.andP;  Users need to know the physical location ofservices outside their current profile in order to access them.andM;Furthermore, NNS has a size constraint.andP;  Although it supports 400 servers ina domain, NNS supports only 250 connections to a server in a NetWare 386environment (100 in the NetWare 2.15 environment).andM;Novell will seek to integrate NNS with its other NetWare services and toprovide a truly distributed global directory service.andP;  It claims to have adevelopment effort for such a global distributed directory capabilitycurrently underway.andM;Even though a future directory service will be X.500 based, Novell plans tosupport other directory service protocols, such as the Apple Name BindingProtocol, Yellow Pages, the TCP/IP Domain Name Service, and the currentNetWare Bindery-based directory, in keeping with its vision of delivering aplatform for integration.andM;SECURITY SERVICE.andP;  NetWare are 386 offers a strong set of LAN securitymeasures, including authentication, authorization, accounting, andadministration.andP;  In fact, designers of the LAN Manager API set kept in mindthe need to match Novell's security and administration features.andP;  Novell usesits object-oriented Bindery to maintain specifications of object properties,functionality, and access levels.andP;  The Bindery offers a set of APIs todevelopers.andM;Security Services in NetWare 386 fall into three categories: encryption,authentication, and authorization.andM;User passwords are encrypted as they are sent to the server.andP;  Administratorscan send data to be backed up in encrypted form.andM;At login, NetWare dynamically assigns each user an identification key thatchanges for each session.andP;  NetWare authenticates a user's identity each timehe or she requests access to a service or to data.andP;  Before granting acces,NetWare checks the authenticated user's authorization for the requestedresources.andM;Novell intends to integrate the encryption, authentication, and authorizationservices with the coming global directory service.andM;MANAGEMENT SERVICES.andP;  In addition to the queue and security managementoffered in NetWare 386, Novell has added a new service: the Remote ManagementFacility (RMF).andP;  RMF is a client-server application that provides remotenetwork installation, configuration, and monitoring; a virtual console;distributed backup; and a support and education tool.andP;  RMF consists of afront-end configuration utility, a front-end virtual console interface, andback-end NLMs.andM;With RMF, an administrator preconfigures a remote LAN using the configurationutility.andP;  The diskette goes to the remote office, and the administrator usesthe virtual console utitlity to install, configure, and monitor the remoteLAN.andM;The back-end NLMs provide services, including:andM;* Back-end authenticationandM;* BackupandM;* The ability to take complete control of a remote server through the consoleandM;Like the NNS, RMF is a separate package from core NetWare 386.andM;NetWare 386andM;Communication ServicesandM;Novell has had a set of gateway products and other LAN and host linkageproducts providing SNA, TCP/IP, and WAN (X.25, T1, asynchronous, andsynchronous) connectivity.andP;  These will continue to run with earlier NetWaresystems or in less demanding situations.andP;  For a strategic communicationsservice solution, however, Novell is rolling out the beginnings of itsNetWare 386 Communications Services.andM;Novell built its new line of communication services as a set of NLMs that canbe dynamically loaded or unloaded from a NetWare 386 server.andP;  It supportseach client workstation (DOS, Windows 3, Macintosh, OS/2, and Unix) in itsnative protocol in conjunction with NetWare's ability to concurrently supportmultiple transport protocols via its Protocol Engine.andM;Novell has implemented the first set of communication services to tap intothe SNA world (see Illustrations 5 and 6).andP;  (IBM connectivity has been ahistoric strength for Novell.)andP;  The same architecture that enables this levelof connectivity to IBM will also support similar connectivity to otherenvironments.andM;Communications Services builds on the functionality of NetWare 386.andP;  Itprovides a set of APIs, services, and functions that enable developers towrite applications without forcing them to learn all about NetWare.andP;  Each NLMmodule offers its own set of APIs.andP;  The APIs allow developers to manage theconfiguration and routing of data between the service provider and theclient.andP;  communication Services is based on the Streams interface.andP;  One ofthe key points in this design is that the applications based on CommunicationServices pick up all the features of NetWare (security, network management,audit trails) free.andP;  Novell developers were able to port their earlier SNAservices in just a few months.andM;Communications services have full access to NetWare 386 security, naming, andmanagement services, while providing extensions in some of these areas.andM;For security, the Communications Services extends protection tocommunications resources such as links, hosts, and sessions.andP;  Administratorscan restrict the physical station from which user can access certain hostresources (such as an LU6.2 session), can implement time and daterestrictions per user for host access, and can keep an audit trail of allhost resource access.andP;  Communications Services also provides name mapping tohost and link resources.andM;The basic Communication Executive consists of 8 NLMs with documented APIs(when fully loaded, Communication Services uses up to 19 or 20 NLMs).andP;  Execis what adds and extends NetWare 386 to provide the services.andP;  All work inconjunction to provide the set of services.andM;Novell uses what it calls the connection multiplexer as the main path throughwhich all communication between service providers and users or betweendifferent agents work.andP;  The mux manages the Streams used by these differentcomponents.andP;  In effect, it just moves messages from one queue into another inStreams.andM;The communication multiplexer provides upper and lower Streams facilities(called, in Novell jargon, upper mux and lower mux).andP;  The distinctionsbetween the two types of facilities are basically ease of programming use andperformance.andP;  Upper mux facilities are much more forgiving to the programmer,although they are less flexible and can't be put to sleep.andP;  The C libraryinterface to these facilities is fairly simple, and the upper mux serviceproviders are straightforward to write.andP;  Upper mux facilities use theCommunication Executive for service validation.andM;Lower mux facilities are for use where performance is an issue.andP;  They areimplemented as Streams device drivers.andP;  They need to turn messages around, topass them up and downstream.andP;  Putting any of these NLMs to sleep will onlyscrew up the situation, as you'd be blocking Streams.andP;  Developers using thesefacilities must follow the ATandamp;T Streams guidelines.andM;The eight NLMs (called agents) that form the core of the CommunicationExecutive follow.andP;  (The first four are the upper mux facilities; the secondfour, the lower.)andM;* The Local Console Agent manipulates the communication services themselves.andO;For example, when it comes up, it registers your services and your messages(for national language support and so on).andM;* The Tracing Agent traces services and can be used for debugging,management, or testing.andP;  Currently, it does two types of tracing: tracing ofthe Communication Executive header packets and SNA services tracing.andP;  Thirdparties could enhance this NLM to provide more detailed tracing, tracing ofdifferent services, and so on.andM;* The Communication Management Agent manages the whole communication servicessystem.andP;  It gathers statistics, gets alerts, and provides a set of parametersthat need to be supported by all service providers.andM;* The Database Agents offer access to facilities such as Btrieve or whateverother database system is used.andP;  There are two database agents: One offers aStreams-based interface, the other a call-based interface.andP;  Novell wanted toprovide a higher level interface to certain Database facilities (such as aname service).andP;  The lower-level call interface adds performance, and it alsoprovides some insurance.andP;  If, for some reason, the communication system isnot fully functional, some agents could still go to the database to getinformation.andM;* The second Database Agent.andP;  (See above.)andM;* The Connection Manager Agent is the interface to TPI, and so specifies howto communicate with different protocol stacks.andP;  As long as a protocol stackhas a TPI interface, communications services can communicate with it.andM;* A Service (name) Mapping Agent handles the translation from names intoactual service providers.andP;  A service user can request the service by its nameor by the specifics of the service provider (for example, &quot;I want an LU2.0session.&quot;).andP;  The service mapping agent finds outwhat that request means usingthe database, finds out if the service is available, and checks with thesecurity agent for authorization.andM;* A Security Service Agent determines whether or not a user should get theservice he or she requests.andP;  The service also provides an audit trail.andP;  InCommunication Services, different service providers have an object ID.andP;  TheSecurity Service uses this ID as well as an instance ID for completeidentification.andP;  The Security Service uses the Bindery as NetWare does today.andO;Communications Services, due out later this fall, currently offers severalcomponents.andM;NETWARE 386 SERVICES FOR SAA.andP;  NetWare Service for Systems ApplicationArchitecture (SAA) is a server module that supports up to 1,000 concurrenthost sessions to multiple hosts.andP;  (The use of the Name Service allows usersto log in and address hosts and links by name.)andP;  It emulates SNA Node Types2.0 and 2.1, and supports concurrent display, printer, and APPC sessions.andP;  Italso includes the LU6.2 Protocol Boundary with the SAA CPI-C (CommonProgramming Interface--Communications) Interface.andM;The software provides an entry point implementation of NetView, allowing thehost to monitor the NetWare-based communications service.andP;  It also providesreal-time alert notification, real-time session control, fault, performance,and configuration management through the NetWare Communication ServicesManager application.andP;  Network managers also can configure services fromanywhere on the extended network.andM;Novell also is providing a set of APIs supporting to development of clientand server applications without requiring host communication programmingskills.andM;NetWare 3270 LAN Workstations.andP;  Novell plans to offer three clientworkstation platforms that function with the service for SAA and the NovellSNA gateway this autumn.andM;The LAN workstation for DOS supports up to five concurrent sessions withmultiple hosts, supports APPC applications, and offers a set of APIs,including IBM's HLLAPI and Novell's own 3270 API.andM;The LAN workstation for Windows 3.0 supports up to 26 concurrent sessionswith multiple hosts, each in its own window.andP;  The LAN workstation forMacintosh also supports up to 26 concurrent sessions with multiple hosts.andO;All the workstation packages support IND$FILE and NVL$FILE host file transferprograms.andM;OS/2 and Unix workstation packages are due in 1991.andM;Communications Services Manager.andP;  Based on Windows 3.0, the CommunicationsServices Manager application provides centralized management of distributedCommunications Services across the network.andP;  Using the graphical display, itprovides real-time event and performance monitoring.andP;  The Manager offersreal-time control over communication resources and host sessions, providestrace and diagnostic facilities, includes event-filtering and loggingcapabilities, and allows the collection and graphing of performancestatistics for trend analysis.andM;Communications Services Development Kit.andP;  The development kit provides APIsto all communication services for client-and server-based aplications.andP;  Itincludes a database with simple APIs to store configuration, security,naming, and network management data.andP;  A security NLM restricts access tospecific communication records and creates audit trail records.andP;  Aname-mapping NLM handles the mapping of host links and resources the NovellName Service names.andP;  It also includes an LU6.2 Protocol Boundary NLM tofacilitate the development of server-based LU6.2 transaction programs.andM;OTHER CURRENT SOLUTIONS.andP;  Novell provides communications solutions in threemain areas: remote PC access to LANs, host connectivity, and wide areanetworking.andM;Remote PC Access to LANs.andP;  NetWare AnyWare, used in conjunction with theNetWare Asynchronous Communications Server (NACS), allows remote PCs to dialin for network services, application, and data.andP;  This particular solutionrequires a locally-connected workstation to boot the AnyWare software, whichthen transmits screens of data back to the remote PC running its version ofAnyWare; all processing is done on the locally attached LAN.andP;  (This is asolution very like those available from third parties fornon-network-specific remote access.)andM;Another solution, the NetWare Access Server, allows up to 15 users to dial into a LAN.andP;  Access Server software has its own dedicated 386 server andcreates virtual 640K DOS machines for each of the users.andP;  Again, the serverhandles all processing, transmitting only screen updates to the remote PC.andM;Host Connectivity.andP;  Novell offers a set of products for single-user IBMterminal emulation (both 3270 and 5250).andP;  Novell also offers a set of SNAgateways that support a range of sessions and functions.andP;  The low-end SNAGateway ELS supports up to 16 sessions for up to 16 users and emulates an NT2.0.andM;The NetWare SNA Gateway offers up to 128 host sessions for up to 97 LAN usersand also appears as an NT 2.0 device.andP;  NetWare LU6.2 adds APPC support to theNetWare SNA Gateways.andM;A 5250 gateway provides LAN-based access to System/3X minicomputers andAS/400s.andM;Wide Area Networks (WANs).andP;  The X.25 Gateway connects the LAN to a public orprivate data network and supports a variety of terminal emulation productsthrough the Interactive Terminal Interface API.andP;  NetWare Link/X.25 connectsthe LAN with up to 11 remote LANs simultaneously over an X.25 network.andM;A NetWare Link/64 allows the creation of WANs with synchronous connections atspeeds up to 64 Kbps.andP;  And NetWare Link/T1 enables the creation of NetWareWANs at speeds up to the full European El rate of 2.048 Mbps.andM;File/Print ServiceandM;As we noted above, Novell made much of its reputation based upon theperformance of its proprietary file system.andP;  Novell's file system providesshared access for DOS, OS/2, and Macintosh clients, with support for Unixcoming.andP;  Many of the improvements made in NetWare 386 went into expanding thephysical and performance capabilities of the file system, which Novell iscalling its Universal File Service.andM;Novell is doing more than implementing NCP on a variety of platforms,however.andP;  Its goal with its Universal File Service is to allow clients tomaintain their native file service as well as implement support for certainstandard file servers.andP;  Thus, Novell is working to provide support for AFP,NFS, and FTAM, with other file systems (such as AFS and SMB) as potentialfuture offerings.andM;In conjunction with its distributed directory service and support for otherstandard protocols, novell intends to evolve its Universal File Serviceconcept to become more of a global file service.andP;  How soon that will provefeasible, given current limitations on the name service and the absoluteabsence of a distributed directory service, remains to be seen.andM;AFP SUPPORT.andP;  Novell is implementing Apple File Protocol (AFP) support inNetWare 386 3.1 as an NLM.andP;  Its presence will require the AppleTalk stack NLMon the server.andP;  It is not a gateway.andP;  This is native mode client AFP talkingto NetWare 386.andM;Developers interested in AFP can use the standard Mac Toolbox calls.andP;  Fileand folder names, file I/O, and file access modes are all the same as inAppleShare.andP;  However, by being in the NetWare environment, AFP clients haveaccess to NetWare security.andM;There are a few deviations from the AFP 2.0 specification and the NetWare AFPNLM implementation.andP;  NetWare and AppleShare sometimes return different errorcodes or return the same error codes for different reasons.andM;Also, AppleShare itself sometimes deviates from the AFP specification.andP;  SinceNovell's goal is to provide real-world connectivity, it must followAppleShare's deviations rather than the exact AFP specification.andP;  At times,NetWare adheres more closely to the specification than does AppleShare.andP;  And,at times, NetWare deviates from the specification in order to promotefile-sharing.andM;The AppleShare and NetWare security models are quite different.andP;  Novellgenerally enforces the NetWare model.andP;  And finally, there are a few basicincompatibilities between NetWare and AFP (such as changing passwords, theuse of gray folders, and file handles).andP;  Novell has promised to try todocument them and to warn developers to avoid them.andM;NFSSUPPORT.andP;  Novell's support for Network File System (NFS) comes with TCP/IPfor NetWare 386.andP;  With these NLMs, DOS nodes using IPX/SPX and NCP fileservice to the NetWare server can share data with Unix systems talking to theserver using the NFS protocol.andP;  The server supports both protocols in thesame files, or provides access to the same printers and print queues throughdifferent protocols.andM;(Novell has opened up two paths for supporting Unix applications in NetWare.andO;The first is to port over to NetWare 386.andP;  The second is to use PortableNetWare on a Unix system.)andM;The main purpose of the current design of the NFS solution is to allow Unixworkstations to access files on the NetWare server using the NFS protocol or,in other words, to allow Unix workstations to integrate into sophisticated PCLANs.andM;Novell feels pretty confident about its NFS server capability and predictsthat it can achieve better performance as an NFS server than can a SunSparcintosh.andM;FTAM SERVER.andP;  Through its support for the OSI stack, Novell also plans toprovide a NetWare 386 FTAM server.andP;  (See Illustration 7.)andP;  FTAM is aninteresting challenge because it is designed to provide a virtual fileservice on its own.andP;  FTAM provides transparent transfer and access of fileson the network regardless of the host operating system or format.andP;  In otherwords, it tries to encompass all features of all possible file servers in oneset of file attributes.andP;  NetWare emulates this FTAM virtual file store usingthe NetWare namespaces to store the FTAM-specific file attributes.andP;  ThroughODI, the FTAM server is independent of data link.andP;  Novell FTAM will becompatible with DOS, Unix, and Macintosh, although there are some nuances,depending upon how you want to share files.andP;  FTAM will be completelycompatible with DOS and NFS text files.andP;  In an FTAM to/from Unix transfer,there should be no change.andP;  The only change in moving from FTAM to DOS willbe that NetWare will truncate the FTAM name to a unique 8.3 name in the DOSformat.andP;  There will be no change in moving from DOS to FTAM.andM;Mac files, however, have a different structure.andP;  Novell FTAM will transferMacintosh files as FTAM binaries in the Mac Binary II format.andP;  Novell willmake its best effort to map the file attributes.andP;  When picking up an FTAMfile, the Mac will change the name to the 32-character Mac format,eliminating any illegal characters.andP;  When FTAM accepts a Mac file, it will,in turn, change the name to the Unix format.andP;  Novell picked Unix naming forconvenience more than anything else.andM;Once you add FTAM namespace to a volume, you will not be able to remove it.andO;There will be a small hit in disk space utilization as each file is a128-byte directory entry.andP;  The FTAM namespace must be loaded before volume ismounted.andM;The FTAM server supports the transfer of basic files from and to FTAMclients.andP;  The FTAM server will share files with other file systems on thenetwork as well: NetWare, NFS, and the Mac.andM;Novell implemented its beta version of FTAM using a set of five NLMs.andP;  (SeeIllustration 8.)andP;  The upper layer consists of the FTAM server itself, alongwith the responding protocol and the programmatic interface.andP;  NetWare FTAMdoes not directly access the namespace; rather, it accesses it throughNetWare 386.andM;Novell FTAM will conform to the NIST T1 (transfer) M1 (management) profiles.andO;It also will adhere to the NBS-9 document type for directory access.andP;  Thestandard for directory access is still in draft stage.andP;  As an interimsolution, NIST developed NBS-9.andP;  NBS-9 consists of basic file management:naming, deleting, and creating.andP;  Novell FTAM will conform to the limited FTAMGovernment OSI Protocol (GOSIP) specification (file transfer, no access),although it will interoperate with a full FTAM implementation.andP;  Novell alsoplans to conform to the limited FTAM specification for TOP 3.0, and tointeroperate with applications conformant to the U.K.andP;  GOSIP specification.andM;The other strong feature of Novell's OSI offering is the TLI support.andP;  Withthose NLMs, as well as the FTAM Server NLMS, developers will be able to takeexisting applications that run over TLI and port them to NetWare 386, useother vendors' FTAM clients to communicate with a NetWare 386 server, anddevelop new NLM OSI transport applications over the Novell OSI transport.andM;For the future, Novell plans to do a full FTAM server offering record levelaccess.andP;  Furthermore, it will add network management into its OSI stack,enabling that stack to talk to a network management agent.andM;And currently, Novell supports only ES/IS routing.andP;  When the IS/IS routingmechanism matures, Novell will implement it.andP;  So, at this point, NetWare 386will not be performing OSI routing.andM;PRINT SERVICE.andP;  NetWare Print services support both server andworkstation-attached printer-sharing.andP;  The print server can manage up to 16printers, and a dedicated print server can handle print queues from up toeight network file servers.andP;  A workstation can manage up to five remoteprinters, although performance on this nondedicated server degrades rapidly.andM;Novell has not managed to match the capabilities of thirdparty value addedprocesses (VAPs) for print management in earlier versions of NetWare with itsPrint Server 1.2 for NetWare 386.andP;  It doesn't offer theterminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) capability that some have, for example,forcing the workstations to unload application software in order to managethe printing processes.andP;  It does offer, however, a TSR facility forconfiguring new printers attached to workstations.andM;In general, Novell has introduced some substantial improvements to the printservice, particularly in the flexibility of assigning jobs and printers toqueues.andP;  Additionally, the print service will alert operators to problemsencountered with the print device--such as running out of paper.andM;In the future, Novell would like to provide extended printer capabilities,such as supporting feeders and finishers.andP;  In general, we should note that wehave seen few extremely highly functional print service solutions in theindustry, the main exception being Xerox (with Digital and Sun planning to behot on its heels).andM;Messaging ServiceandM;Novell has no electronic mail application of its own.andP;  It does offer,however, a store-and-forward Message Handling Service (MHS) which thirdparties may use.andP;  (Novell licensed MHS from Action Technologies in an earlierpartnership.)andP;  A Novell-affiliated company, Indisy, has created an MHSgateway to IBM DISOSS and PROFS.andP;  Novell also plans to provide an X.400 MHSgateway.andM;But Novell sought a more robust message handling system than an MHS.andP;  Itwould have preferred, for example, to send multiple attached documents, andto be able to have a &quot;fan-out&quot; capability for sending a single message tomultiple users.andP;  So Novell developed its own NetWare 386 NLM for messaging:the Message Management System (MMS), which has yet to be released officially.andO;Again, note that MMS is not an official product, but a messaging engineimplemented via the NLM architecture on NetWare 386.andP;  Unfortunately, ActionTechnologies has developed a new version of MHS that addresses these sameissues, and now puts Novell in a situation of potential incompatibility,although Novell promises backward compatibility with the earlier versions ofMHS.andM;The new MMS software also reportedly will be able to utilize operatingsystem-based communications mechanisms, such as that promised for MacintoshSystem 7.0.andP;  This would allow the exchange of messages between MMSapplications and applications exploiting System 7.0's IAC capabilities.andP;  MMSis fully MHS compliant, allowing all the applications and gateways writtenfor MHS to continue to run under the MMS NLM engine.andM;Currently, Novell messaging does not use the Bindery files for addressing.andO;The message service maintains its own directory files.andP;  A clear direction forNovell is to integrate its future message services into its future directoryservices.andM;There are currently three sets of APIs that provide access to the messagingservice: the Standard Message Format API (SMF, used by dozens of packages forNetWare), the SMF gateway API, and the X.400 API Association Gateway API (forMMS only).andP;  The two SMF APIs are file based; the last is procedural.andM;In a traditional, procedure-based API, an application sends information to aservice provider through a procedural call interface.andP;  The service grabs theparameters through the procedural call interface, and then provides therequired service.andP;  In a file-based API, rather than send information througha procedural interface, the required information is written out to disk in afile.andP;  The service provider picks up the information from the file andprovides the service in the same way.andP;  The two types of APIs are conceptuallysimilar in that they provide the required parameters to the service provider,which then acts upon those parameters.andM;SMF API.andP;  In the SMF application, a sender submits a message to a well-knownlocation.andP;  The messaging engine then picks it up from that application andacts on it to provide the required service--e.g., to route it to the requireddestination.andP;  The retrieving application then picks up that message.andM;Writing an SMF application basically comes down to using the file format forthe SMF message.andP;  The SMF API consists of the message format of the SMFmessage and the well-known location of where these messages need to bedeposited.andM;The SMF message consists of two files: the message itself and an optionalenclosure or attachment to the message.andP;  The message proper has three parts:128-byte binary header (envelope), header section (to, from, etc.), followedby message body.andP;  Again, SMF is limited to just one attachment at this time.andM;SMF GATEWAY API.andP;  The SMF gateway uses the same SMF file format, but, in thiscase, the messaging engine recognizes that to deliver to a specified user, ithas to go through a gateway (to PROFS, for example).andP;  The message engine thusplaces the message in the well-defined gateway location.andM;Gateway software then grabs messages out of the well-defined location,performs any needed translation, then connects to host and submits themessages to PROFS.andM;APIA API.andP;  The X.400 API Association (APIA) is a consortium of companiesstriving to specify a common program interface for the X.400 protocol.andP;  As isoften the case, while the protocol may be standard, the interfaces are not.andO;Having a common, consistent interface for any service such as this would be agreat boon to application developers because they would have no need torewrite their code.andP;  (This is the same rationale IBM used for coming up withits CPI-C.)andM;The emerging APIA API is a procedural API to X.400 services that carries allthe X.400 semantics.andP;  It is the interface between the messaging engine andthe X.400 service provider.andP;  A user submits a message to the messagingengine.andP;  The messaging engine then makes use of the gateway provider X.400services.andP;  The interface between the messaging engine and the gatewayprovider is the gateway API.andM;The API itself is object-oriented.andP;  The message engine first creates object.andO;The service provider gives back a handle for the object.andP;  The message enginethen adds attributes to the object (such as subject, source, content,delivery, etc.) to build up message object.andP;  Once the message object isconstructed, the message engine calls a submit routine to pass off themessage to the X.400 provider.andP;  The gateway provides the implementation foreach of the routines.andP;  Implementation is basically up to the developer as towhat underlying implementation it wants to give to the different objects.andM;FUTURE DIRECTIONS WITH MESSAGING.andP;  Novell is fully committed to messaging asan important, fundamental service to developers and end users.andP;  Novellrecognizes the appeal of mail as an application enabler for certain types ofsolutions.andP;  In the future, Novell plans to tie into directory services asthey emerge, and wants to provide support for multiple transportmechanisms--such as SMTP, X400, IBM connectivity, and so forth.andP;  It alsoplans to provide multiple access methods--other types of interfaces, in otherwords.andP;  Apple's IAC in System 7.0 would fall into this category.andP;  The plannedAPIA application (rather than gateway) API also is a definite possibility forfuture implementation.andM;Novell also plans to address more completely some of the security issues thathave surrounded its messaging solutions in the past.andP;  (MHS, for example,allowed users to go into a directory and see user passwords.)andP;  The NLM-basedMMS will have access to the full range of NetWare security capabilities.andM;Database ServiceandM;Novell, recognizing the important role a database plays in a distributednetwork environment, provides back-end database services.andP;  NetWare Btrieve isa key-indexedrecord manager for high-performance data-handling.andP;  NetWare SQLprovides back-end database services for Lotus 1-2-3 3.0 as well as a fewother database applications and tools.andP;  Both Btrieve and NetWare SQL areNLMs.andM;Novell is not wedded to Btrieve, however.andP;  Novell has invested in Gupta,which in turn plans to implement its SQL Base server as a set of NLMs.andO;Oracle, too, has plunged ahead to implement an Oracle server as an NLM.andP;  Thisincrease in available database technology will go a long way to answeringcritics who claim that Novell is not a &quot;client-server&quot; networking company.andO;Given the recognition by many application developers and large system vendorsthat support for Novell is important to their user bases, we wouldn't besurprised to see Sybase (as well as every other major database vendor) appearon NetWare at some point in the future.andM;General CommentsandM;Given space constraints, we've had to skim over or ignore elements of whathas become an extremely full product line from Novell to concentrate on thehighlights of its strategic platform.andP;  (We have a much longer special reporton Novell in the works for the beginning of next year.)andP;  Among the areas thatdeserve a great deal of attention are the developers' tools for NetWare 386.andM;Novell's approach in this area is extremely solutions-oriented, and hencevery attractive to users.andP;  This approach does result in a number of optionsthat developers must weed through, however.andP;  For example, should you port aUnix application to NetWare 386 TCP/IP, or should you use Portable NetWare?andO;For a distributed application, should you use the RPC, or APPC, or CPI-C, orwrite directly to IPX-SPX?andM;One of the Novell engineers used an analogy to describe this welter ofoptions (particularly in the communication area).andP;  He likened the wholeenvironment to that of a transportation system, and pointed out that there isa role for a variety of vehicles in a modem society: bikes, cars, planes,trains, and so on.andP;  If you eliminate all vehicles except for, say, the Boeing747, then you're in good shape for long hauls, but in a bit of a pickle ifyou want to nip down to the corner store.andM;The role of a vendor should not be to restrict the number of optionsavailable to users, but to provide as much support as is possible inselecting from and then using the many options available.andP;  Consulting will bean important enterprise activity (and one for which Novell apparently ispreparing itself).andM;Novell clearly dominates the existing generation of PC LAN solutions.andP;  Thecompany also intends to retain its leadership as we move ahead into thedistributed network computing era.andP;  The foundation work Novell is doing withits NLM architecture, support for multiple protocols, and Portable NetWarewill put the company in a very strong position.andP;  Novell knows from itshistory that much of its success is tied in with third-party solutions.andP;  TheNLM architecture is designed to encourage such innovative services andapplications.andP;  (We can adduce the Wang Open/Image NLMs as an example.)andP;  Suchan architecture lifts the burden of providing applications and solutions fromNovell, leaving it free to concentrate on delivering a viable set offoundation technologies.andM;Measured against a high-end distributed computing environment, Novell'sproducts currently fall short.andP;  The current name service can only prove to bea tactical solution; Novell clearly knows that it needs a global, distributeddirectory capability.andP;  Similar comparisons can be made in several serviceareas, such as filing, printing and messaging.andM;But, Novell is making gains in all those areas.andP;  And, more important, Novellis delivering a foundation for integrating its networks into those higher-endDCE solutions.andP;  Third-parties can assist in this through the use of NLMs.andP;  Wethink that the Communications Services platform is key to Novell's futuresuccess, and we point to the thoroughness with which Novell implemented itsfirst CS solution--the SNA connectivity.andM;Performance and manageability are the hallmarks of Novell's work in thisarea.andP;  Also, Novell offers a key protocol for the IBM environment--NT 2.1.andO;The presence of NT 2.1 enables future support for Advanced Peer to PeerNetworking (APPN) the nonhierarchical, peer-to-peer networking solution forSNA.andP;  novell has an edge in connecting into large IBM environments because ofsuch capabilities, as well as because of the Netview support provided.andO;Similar connections will be possible into the other major enterprisearchitectures as well.andM;A while back, as vendor after vendor endorsed LAN Manager as their strategicPC LAN technology and promised to port LM/X to their various host operatingsystems, it looked as though LanMan would become the default enterprisesolution, while Novell would control the smaller businesses and theworkgroups.andP;  Put another way, while Novell would remain a terrific solutionfor file service, LanMan would become the client-server platform of choice.andM;But since, ovell has redesigned its solutions and responded to customerdemands for client-server solutions, the LanMan camp has bogged down a bit.andO;The two major implementations of LM/X on the market (HP's and ATandamp;T's), differin their API support.andP;  And now we are treated to scenes such as Ken Olsenarm-in-arm with Ray Noorda at DECworld, HP pursuing significant work withNovell and promising to deliver NewWare Office on the Novell platform, andIBM working very closely with Novell.andP;  The lines are no longer clear, nor isit clear any longer that LanMan is the &quot;no-brainer&quot; obvious solution for theenterprise.andP;  The salient fact is that a large number of the distributed,isolated corporate LANs that will become part of the enterprise distributedcomputing environment are NetWare LANs.andP;  Although bringing those LANs up tothe level of capability described above requires an upgrade to NetWare 386,that process appears to be more appealing for many users than the prospect ofswitching to LanMan.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
