(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The new neighbors are quiet. They generallykeep to themselves, eat out a lot, and commune with nature.   The new neighbors also have hooves.   Squeezed out of their traditional woodland habitat byencroaching development, deer are adapting to kids on skateboards,barking dogs, slamming car doors _ in short, the suburbs.   ``They seem to be quite comfortable and taking life in stride,''said Thomas Litwon, director of field research at the 200-acreSeatuck National Wildlife Refuge in Islip, on Long Island's SouthShore.   Litwon directed a three-year Cornell University study ofwhitetail deer living in a neighborhood adjacent to the refuge.About 20 deer live between the houses, not far from a busyintersection and a McDonald's.   The bucks, some with antler racks, weigh as much as 200 pounds;the does weigh up to 100 pounds.   ``It is really amazing but they seem to be very healthy,'' saidLitwon. The Cornell researchers found that the deer ``were clearlymeeting their needs _ food, water and cover.''   Nor is this a phenomenon limited to the suburbs of New YorkCity. Deer have also moved into suburban neighborhoods in largenumbers in Minnesota, Ohio, Wisconsin and Colorado, according towildlife authorities.   ``Long Island is just a microcosm of what is happening all overthe country,'' said Litwon. ``The landscape of our planet ischanging into an urban world and this is one example of what ishappening because of it.''   James Witham of the Illinois Natural History Survey said therehas been a substantial increase of deer in Chicago's suburbs. Herecalled that last year, a deer was hit by a car when it crossed abusy street in Addison, Ill.   Stunned, the deer wandered over to a grocery store. It stood onthe rubber mat at the entry way, opened the automatic door, andcommenced to graze on the lettuce and radishes in the producesection.   ``He evidently thought he found a new place to feed,'' Withamsaid.   Authorities say the buck that crashed through the window ofCaptain's Pizza in Bridgeport, Conn., last summer was not foragingfor Italian food.   Jim Spignesi, biologist with the Connecticut Department ofEnvironmental Protection, theorizes the deer's usual habitat was a90-acre park about five miles away, but development in the areaforced the beast onto Main Street.   Spignesi said the deer believed it was hurdling a three-footstone wall, and did not see the glass. He set off a burglar alarm;officers found the deer cowering in the dining room, according toowner Gregory Kapeteneas. It was treated for minor cuts, andreleased in woods 25 miles away.   Most encounters with the deer are less spectacular. Mary Mooreof Islip says the deer will eat corn out of a plastic cup held byher husband.   ``They come right to our back door. Especially the babies, theones with the white spots,'' she says. ``They don't bother anyone.''   Others are less appreciative. ``They've eaten my bushes rightdown to the stem,'' said one resident who asked that her name notbe used.   She used to think the deer were adorable. No more.   ``It cost me thousands of dollars to replace my azaleas andrhododendrons. Now I have chicken wire around them,'' she said.   Also of concern to residents is Lyme disease, a malady that iscarried by ticks found on deer and other animals. A bite by aninfected tick leaves a red, doughnut-shaped rash which, ifuntreated, can lead to a high fever, paralysis and swelling of thejoints.   State health officials say 450 cases of the disease werereported on Long Island last year, an increase of 50 from 1986.   Edward Bosler, research scientist for the New York State HealthDepartment, said there has been an increase of ticks in the areaswhere the deer live but he believes the deer are ``getting a badrap.''   ``Shooting all the deer would not eliminate Lyme disease,'' saidBosler. ``The tick would only look for another carrier.''   But shooting some of the deer could help the Long Island herd,says Harry Knock, state Department of Environmental Conservationwildlife manager.   Most of Long Island's herd of 3,000 deer inhabit the eastern endof the island. Knock says deer began wandering off Long Islandrefuges and parks in noticeable numbers about six years ago.Over-population is to blame, he says.   ``People have refused to have a deer hunting season on some ofthe refuges because they are afraid they are killing Bambi,'' saidKnock.   About 150 deer died from starvation last year despite a mildwinter, according to Knock. Others face death from disease oraccidents.   Knock advocates a hunting season on lands where it is nowprohibited in order to bring the number of deer into balance withthe food available. He disagrees sharply with those who rebel atBambicide.   ``These well-meaning people are doing a disservice to the deerby looking at them as a personality.'' he said.   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, which overseas thepreserves, is exploring alternatives to reducing the deer herds.   But Ray Whittemore, in charge of the eight U.S. wildlifepreserves on Long Island, said a hunt is unlikely. The publicopposes it, and most of the land was donated with the stipulationthat it remain ``forever wild'' and closed to hunters, he said.   Witham, the Illinois expert, said there is no simple answer.   ``Deer and man are just going to have to learn to live with eachother,'' he said. ``There has to be a balance and compromise.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, March 18</NOTE></DOC>
