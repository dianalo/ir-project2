The Bank of England signaled the change by raising its baselending rate to 14 percent, and major commercial banks responded byboosting their prime lending rates one point to that level.   It was the 10th increase since last June, when rates stood at adecade low of 7.5 percent, but economists called the latest actionparticularly meaningful. The last time interest rates stood at 14percent was in March 1985. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher'sgovernment has sought to curb an annual inflation rate which hasmoved up to 8 percent in April, compared with 3.9 percent a yearearlier.   Stephen King, an economist with James Capel and Co., saidWednesday's rate hike is ``an important statement that thegovernment is not going to accommodate any inflationary pressuresgrowing in the economy.''   After announcing the increase, the Bank of England alsointervened in the foreign exchange market by selling dollars forpounds, underscoring its support for the British currency, dealerssaid.   Both moves helped lift sterling about one cent against thedollar but it quickly fell back from highs reached immediatelyafter the rate announcement. The pound closed at $1.5695 in London,up from $1.5675 dollarslate Tuesday.   Prices fell sharply on London's Stock Exchange. The FinancialTimes-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed down 18.9 points at2,132.7.   But shares were off their lows on news that British retail salesvolume fell an unexpected 1.4 percent in April, providing evidencethat the previous interest rate rises were having some effect ofcurbing strong consumer spending.   A Treasury official, who wasn't identified in accordance withBritish practice, said that while consumer demand was slowing thegovernment couldn't ignore the fall in the currency. A weaker poundfuels inflation by making imports more expensive.   Mrs. Thatcher, speaking at the Conservative Party's Women'sNational Conference, said that while the effects of high interestrates might be uncomfortable, continued high inflation would beworse.   Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson, the Treasury's topofficial, said in a radio interview: ``Overheating is on the way tosubsiding. It is only a matter of time before inflation is comingdown.''   But opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock attacked thegovernment's move, saying the higher interest rates could broadenthe country's trade deficit, which stood at $2.7 billion in March.   Economists predict the British economy will grow between 2.5percent and 2.8 percent this year, vs. 3.8 percent in 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
