In his resignation announcement, Jenninger said he always hadopposed ``every type of totalitarian rule'' and has been aconsistent supporter of Israel.   He told reporters in 1982 he entered public service because hisfather told him the world must avoid another war like the one Hitlerstarted in 1939.   ``Two of my brothers died in the war. My father told me when Iwas 12: `Be of service during your lifetime so that something likethis can never again happen.' That influenced me,'' Jenninger said.   He is a member of Kohl's conservative Christian Democratic Unionand reached the highest position in Parliament on a reputation forfairness and effectiveness.   As a close aide to Kohl, Jenninger was a leading figure inpersuading communist East Germany to let more of its people visit ormove to West Germany.
