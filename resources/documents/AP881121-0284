I'mdetermined to get that budget deficit down ... (but) I can't getdiscouraged every time somebody comes out with yet another report,''Bush said at a news conference announcing three personnelappointments, including that of Richard Darman, a former White Houseaide and deputy Treasury secretary, as budget director.   A report over the weekend by the General Accounting Office, theinvestigative arm of Congress, concluded that a spending freezealone would not fix the deficit, which stood at $150 billion in thebudget year that ended Sept. 30.   The report said that tax increases and cuts in defense and SocialSecurity must be considered to slash the budget deficit and for thenew administration to have ``any flexibility to pursue its ownpolicy agenda'' and for the economy to regain its vigor.   Specifically, the report, said the United States ``cannot`freeze' our way out of the problem.'' During his presidentialcampaign, Bush repeateldy rejected higher taxes and advocted a``flexible freeze'' on spending.   Rep. Bill Gray, D-Pa., chairman of the House Budget Committeesaid earlier today on ``CBS This Morning'' that Bush will probablyhave to reassess his economic assumptions once he gets into officeand will ``submit his own budget, which will reflect the newrealities.''   Bush said today he would indeed ``sit down with my budgetdirector and go into exactly where we stand on all these numbers.''But, he added, ``I don't think there's been any dramatic change inthe figures we've been dealing with. The GAO seems to come out withreports periodically, but I will be persuaded much more by what mybudget director tells me is the reality than by their reports.''   ``I'm open minded in terms of hearing from all these people ...but I'm not going to change my view as to how we get this deficitdown,'' Bush said. ``I spelled out a program ... (that was) endorsedby the American people. I don't remember any Republicans orDemocrats running on a please-raise-my-taxes program,'' he said.   Gray, who is leaving the Budget Committee chairmanship in the newCongress, said the Democratic leadership will support Bush if hecomes up with a plan to meet his stated priorities of reducing thedeficit without new taxes while preserving national defense andimportant programs like Social Security, education, clean air, andthe anti-drug effrt.   ``The question is making sure we have the right numbers and theright kind of assumptions,'' Gray said.</TEXT></DOC>
