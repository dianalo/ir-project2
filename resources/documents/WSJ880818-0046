Mr. Dillon, who was fired from his job at Merrill's New London, Conn., office last month, admitted he bought securities in about 129 companies based on copies of articles he bought from workers at an Old Saybrook, Conn., plant where Business Week is printed.    Mr. Dillon was freed on a $5,000 bond and is scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 12. The wire fraud charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Mr. Dillon is also expected to plead guilty to a similar charge in a New York federal court Sept. 6; prosecutors have agreed to recommend that Mr. Dillon would serve sentences on the two charges concurrently.    R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co., which prints Business Week, has fired seven workers in connection with the affair. At least 19 people, including several stock brokers, have been tied to the inquiry. </TEXT></DOC>
