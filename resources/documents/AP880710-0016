It says such a move would give the United States a chance todramatically increase its savings rate.   But the study warns that the nation must ``strenuously resist''the temptation to splurge and spend the Social Security surpluseson Medicare or other programs.   The study suggests that workers be allowed to divert 2percentage points of their payroll tax into individual investmentaccounts starting in 1990, when the tax climbs from 7.51 to 7.65percentage points.   ``For the typical taxpayer the diversion would amount to about$500 to $1,000 per year,'' the study suggested, with the moneyinvested in accounts ``similar to today's Individual RetirementAccounts, but subject to tougher tests of investment suitabilityand tighter restraints on early withdrawals.''   In exchange for the opportunity to build up private accounts,the workers would eventually get reduced Social Security benefits.   But this approach would free up money for private investment and``ensure that most of the Social Security reserve is productivelyinvested,'' said the study in the July issue of Morgan's WorldFinancial Markets report. The report is published by MorganGuaranty Trust Co., a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. Inc.   After encountering severe deficits in the late 1970s and early1980s, Social Security's trust funds are now growing at a rapidpace _ $20 billion last year alone and an estimated $500 billion ayear by 2015. The system is expected to have $12 trillion inreserve in 2030 _ or about $2.5 trillion in today's dollars.   By law, all of that money must be invested in Treasurysecurities. Each year's Social Security surplus reduces the overallfederal debt by an identical amount.   The Morgan study said it is possible that by 2005, SocialSecurity's trust funds ``could absorb all outstanding federaldebt.''   The Social Security system expects its outgo to start exceedingits income around 2020, and would cash in its federal securitiesover the next three decades to help pay for the retirement of thepost-World War II baby boomers.   The Morgan report said, ``the temptation to squander the loomingSocial Security surpluses for immediate gain must be strenuouslyresisted.''   ``With careful husbandry, (they) present an unequaledopportunity to boost the U.S. net savings and investment rates,perhaps to as much as 8 percent of GNP,'' it said.   The national savings rate has averaged 3 percent in the 1980s,and dipped to just 1.9 percent in 1987.   ``Wisely handled, Social Security surpluses could make adramatic difference for U.S. economic prospects. Higher domesticsavings not only would help eliminate the trade ... deficits, andthe associated dependence on foreign saving, but also would helpbuild up the nation's productive capital stock,'' it said. ``Thatis the only convincing assurance of retirement security.''   It likened Social Security ``to a benevolent `Ponzi' (pyramid)scheme. Each new generation pays for the older generation'sretirement, relying on subsequent generations to do the same.''   ``Any pyramid scheme will unravel if the pool of contributorsfails to expand sufficiently fast. This could well be the case withSocial Security,'' it said.   But it said switching entirely to a private savings system forretirement is unfeasible. ``The best solution could be to privatizejust the surplus portion of Social Security revenues,'' it said.   When Social Security started running annual deficits in 2020,workers would no longer be able to divert part of their payrolltaxes to private accounts.   The study also suggests the possibility of restraining costs byreducing future benefits for middle- and upper-income retirees, andby raising the retirement age to 68 or 69 in the next century. Itis already scheduled to climb to 67 from 65 by the year 2027.</TEXT></DOC>
