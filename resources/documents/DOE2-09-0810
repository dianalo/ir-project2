Exposures to high temperatures throughthe operation of the furnaces, coke ovens, sintering and pelletizingequipment and during inprocessing and product-finishing activities resultedin burns, eye injuries, and heat stress. Exposure to chemical contaminantsduring the smelting and manufacturing stages was shown to cause respiratorydistress and lung cancer. Among the most serious of these contaminantswere benzopyrene, carbon monoxide, coal and coke dust, coke oven emissions,manganese compounds, nitrogen oxides, particulates, and sulfur oxides.Toxicological and physiological properties of chemical substances encounteredduring ferrous smelting and steel manufacturing were listed. Exposuresto loud noise, vibration, and radiation at potentially hazardous levelswere also possible. Current standards and NIOSH recommended limits fortypical process materials, byproducts, emissions, additives, and impuritiesassociated with the iron and steel industry were listed.</TEXT></DOC>
