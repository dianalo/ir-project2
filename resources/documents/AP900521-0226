(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The co-author of a book criticizingU.S. attitudes and trade policies toward Japan said his nation isfighting an uphill economic battle against a ``crazy giant.''   The United States could rebound as an industrial power _ not byJapan-bashing or retaliatory trade policies against his country,but by reviving the spirit that settled the West, Shintaro Ishiharasaid.   ``You should help yourselves,'' he said.   Ishihara and Sony Corp. Chairman Akio Morita co-wrote the 1989book, ``The Japan That Can Say No.'' The book was published only inJapan but translated copies and excerpts have circulated widely inthis country.   In the book, Ishihara argues that Japan needs to be moreassertive in standing up to America. He brags about Japan'stechnological superiority and suggests that Japan could change themilitary balance of power by selling microchips used to targetnuclear missiles to the Soviet Union instead of America.   Ishihara also says American criticism of Japan is based onracism. He and Morita blame short-sighted management for America'sdeclining competitiveness.   Ishihara, a conservative member of the Japanese Diet orparliament, spoke to about 300 people Sunday at a public meetingorganized by U.S. Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., at LawrenceTechnological University in this Detroit suburb.   ``All the Japanese believe in what I say,'' Ishihara saidthrough an interpreter at a news conference after the meetingSunday. ``Detroit is one of the focuses of the U.S.-Japan friction.I have learned much from this town ... (but) nothing surprised me.   ``I don't think I have to change my way of thinking.''   Washington and Tokyo recently negotiated the removal of Japaneseimport barriers on trade in satellites, supercomputers and woodproducts. As a result, the Bush administration has decided not toput Japan on this year's ``hit list'' of countries with unfairtrading practices under the ``Super 301'' provision of the 1988Trade Act.   Despite the agreement, Ishihara said the trade act is ``a wronglaw'' that will only increase trade tensions.   U.S. exercise of the Super 301 clause ``is something like apowerful giant wielding a sword _ a crazy giant, hurtingthemselves,'' he said.   Ishihara also was harshly critical of bootleg translations of``The Japan That Can Say No'' by, among others, the Pentagon andLevin himself _ who published portions of it in the CongressionalRecord.   ``I used to believe that freedom of speech was guaranteed in theUnited States,'' Ishihara said, ``but what has been done to my bookwas a lynch.'' In Washington early this month, he said he wasworking on publishing an English version.   Levin said Americans are rightly concerned about what he saidwere the relatively closed markets that have contributed to thiscountry's $50 billion trade deficit with Japan. But he concededthat some of Ishihara's criticism of U.S. shortcomings ineducation, management and cooperation between government and theprivate sector was justified.   ``Americans feel it just isn't right that what we produce withthe sweat of our hands and the energies of our minds don't haveaccess to Japan,'' Levin said. ``Americans are impatient; we don'tlike it.   ``But you also heard the applause (during the public meeting)when you heard someone say, `We've got to shape up, too,''' hesaid. ``When there was no $50-billion trade deficit, nobody wastalking about racism.''   Levin said he planned to visit Japan later this year to meetwith Ishihara and his constituents. More face-to-face meetingscould improve U.S.-Japan relations now defined mainly by governmentnegotiators and the media, he said.   ``We really don't know each other very well,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
