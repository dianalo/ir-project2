The refusal Saturday by Masayoshi Ito, chairman of the party'sExecutive Council and a former foreign minister, left the LiberalDemocratic Party with no clear choice for a Takeshita successor.   In rejecting persistent requests, Ito said party leaders lackeda ``sense of crisis'' about the party's plunging public support. Hesaid he was not confident he could carry out ``political and partyreforms needed'' to reverse public distrust   He also cited his age, 75, and his health problems with diabetes.
