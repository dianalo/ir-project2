The toughest sentence, eight years in prison, was imposed for conspiracy and filing false tax returns on Gilbert C. Schulman, former president and the only Bevill Bresler executive to fight the criminal charges in court. The judge said Mr. Schulman committed perjury at his two trials.    U.S. District Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise imposed lesser jail terms on four other former executives. In an unusual requirement, he also ordered the four to read and analyze in writing six books on human suffering and achievement, including &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; and a biography of George Washington. The assignment will be part of the defendants' probation after prison.    Mr. Schulman said yesterday that he accepted responsibility for the wrongdoing at the firm, though he has never admitted knowingly committing crimes. His attorney said he will appeal the jury convictions.    Robert L. Bevill, former chairman, received a prison sentence of 2 1/2 years; John D. Rooney, former treasurer and comptroller, 18 months; Stuart A. Gottlieb, former senior vice president, nine months; and Robert S. Levine, former executive vice president and the first to start cooperating with the government, three months.    All four had pleaded guilty before trial. Besides prison, each received five years' probation and the writing assignment.    The four all said yesterday that they were sorry for their actions at Bevill Bresler; Mr. Rooney called his crimes &quot;the biggest mistake of my life.&quot;    Mr. Levine, who received the lightest sentence, had come forward a year before the others. His cooperation with the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other agencies has contributed to continuing investigations, prosecutor Paul A. Weissman said.    Bevill Bresler, a currently defunct brokerage that was based in Livingston, N.J., collapsed along with an affiliate in April 1985. The former officers were later charged with carrying out a complex securities fraud for three years and with siphoning millions of dollars from the company, crimes that cost scores of U.S. banks, thrifts and municipalities almost $150 million.    &quot;An extraordinary securities fraud (was) committed by all five of you,&quot; the judge said at the sentencings yesterday. He said the crimes reflected &quot;simple greed&quot; and that he wanted business people to know that if they engage in similar activity &quot;the consequences are not pleasant.&quot;    Besides the securities fraud that involved the misuse of customers' securities, Mr. Gottlieb also admitted tax evasion and defrauding his colleagues in what the judge termed &quot;his own independent scams.&quot;    The judge said the executives' reading and writing assignments -- which include analyses of the six books in the context of the executives' &quot;BBS experience&quot; -- are due a year after their probations start. </TEXT></DOC>
