It is suggested in this paper that the development of automated,real-time, diagnostic monitoring systems is one means of minimizing sudden,expected robot failures. The general concept of such monitoring systemsis reviewed and the main requirements of a robot health monitoring systemare identified. Finally, the steps necessary to develop a rugged andreliable robot monitoring system for industrial applications are reviewed.</TEXT></DOC>
