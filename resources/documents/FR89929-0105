The general permit establishes effluentlimitations, monitoring requirements, and reporting requirements for dischargesfrom Alaskan seafood processors. This permit will cover mobile and shore-basedseafood processing facilities in all waters under U.S. jurisdiction offthe coast of Alaska, other than those waters listed as excluded areas.On May 18, 1989, Region 10 of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)published in the <T2>Federal Register</T2> (54 FR 21470) a notice of the draft general permit(proposed reissuance) which is being reissued as a final permit today.Today's notice includes a copy of the final permit and the Agency's responseto comments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The reissued permit is effective October 30, 1989. In orderto be covered under this reissued permit, facilities must submit to EPAa ``Notice of Intent to be Covered'' no later than 30 days after today'sreissuance date, unless this information has already been submitted forthe 1989 processing year. New facilities are required to submit the Noticeof Intent at least 30 days prior to commencement of operations.

State Certification and Coastal Zone Management Act</ITAG>In accordance with Section 401 of the CWA, the Alaska Department of EnvironmentalConservation (ADEC) has conditionally certified that this reissued generalpermit will comply with the Alaska Water Quality standards. All of ADEC'sconditions have been incorporated into the final permit.The Alaska Division of Environmental Coordination has determined that thegeneral permit is consistent with the Alaska Coastal Management Programprovided that the ADEC conditions are included in the permit.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Response to Comments</ITAG>The public comment period for the General Permit for Alaskan Seafood Processorsbegan May 18, 1989, and expired on June 16, 1989. Comment letters werereceived from the following parties: East Point Seafood Company, BeringSea Fishermen's Association, Bogle and Gates, Alaska Trollers Association,State of Alaska, Department of Environmental Conservation, Douglas andJanice Latta, Clark Eaton, Donald E. Power, Walkers Alaskan Seafood, StanWood, Eyak Packing Company, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.Significant comments received during the public comment period were reviewedby EPA and considered during finalization of the general permit. As a result,several changes have been made to the final permit. The responses to thesecomments are as follows:1. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was requested that the permit exclude discharges tolakes.<T3>Response: </T3>The permit has been revised in this manner, based onthe extremely poor flushing characteristics of lakes.2. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that the terms ``vicinity''and ``poor flushing'' be defined in the permit.<T3>Response: </T3>The term ``vicinity'' has been defined as one mile inthe permit. ``Poor flushing'' is defined as ``lacking currents, flows,and/or tidal forces to adequately disperse pollutants.''3. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was requested that the permit language regarding foambe revised to prohibit the discharge of foam in accordance with the statewater quality standards.<T3>Response: </T3>In accordance with state standards, foam is now prohibitedfrom discharge.4. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was requested that dive surveys be required for processorsusing fine screens, based on past water quality impacts from screened discharges.<T3>Response: </T3>The state certification stipulates that dive surveysshall be required for processors using screens. The final permit has beenchanged accordingly.5. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was recommended that chlorine samples be obtainedduring plant washdown, when chlorine-based solutions are often used tosanitize equipment. In addition, it was recommended that the permit authorizeEPA and ADEC to modify the permit if chlorine samples indicate violationsof state water quality standards.<T3>Response: </T3>EPA agrees with both comments. Chlorine sampling isnow required during washdown, and a permit reopener clause for chlorinehas been added to the permit.6. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was requested that water used to transfer seafoodto the facility be routed through the wastehandling system (i.e., the outfall)in enclosed harbors, based on concerns over foam generation.<T3>Response: </T3>The permit already requires the discharge of fish transferwater through the wastehandling system if discharges through separate conveyancesare not in compliance with state standards.7. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was recommended that weekly rather than monthly samplingfor chlorine be required in the permit.<T3>Response: </T3>Based on the state certification, weekly sampling (forone year) is required in the permit.8. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification of the samplingrequirements presented in attachment 3. It was asked whether all freshwaterstreams are included under these scenarios. In addition, the commenterasked if additional samples would be required if waste accumulations arediscovered, in order to delineate the extent of accumulation. Finally,it was noted that a diagram under part II was absent from the draft permit.<T3>Response: </T3>Freshwater dischargers are required to conduct bottomsampling, unless a waiver is obtained based on site-specific information(most likely high flow velocities and/or sample collection problems). Thepermit has been revised to require freshwater facilities to follow thesecond sampling scenario. This will insure that the discharge point andat least one downstream location are sampled (the diagram is now included).If bottom samples reveal accumulated seafood wastes, the permit authorizesEPA and ADEC to require additional sampling (part II.B.5).9. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was recommended that the permit be clarified withregard to the discharge of graywater. The commenter noted that the dischargeof graywater from shore based facilities must receive the same treatmentas sewage.<T3>Response: </T3>``Graywater'' is defined in the permit as a wastewatergenerated on a vessel. The permit therefore authorizes the discharge ofgraywater without treatment only from a vessel. Similar wastewaters generatedin a shore-based operation are considered sanitary wastes and must meetthe permit requirement for those wastes. The phrase ``vessels only'' hasbeen added to the section authorizing the discharge of graywater for clarification.In addition, a definition for ``sanitary wastes'' has been added to thepermit.10. <T3>Comment: </T3>Several comments were received which pertain to EPA'sproposal to extend coverage under this permit to all processors in Alaska.The expiring permit excepted from coverage processors who met the followingcriteria:A. Discharge less than four tons per day of processing waste;B. Discharge at least \1/2\ mile off-shore from the outer coast at a depthof at least 42 feet;C. Discharge at least 300 yards away from any other vessels so as not tocause a nuisance in general;D. Do not discharge in bays, harbors, inlets, coves, lagoons or other protectedareas along the Alaska coast; andE. Do not cause any floating solids, visible foam in other than trace amountsor oily wastes which produce a sheen on the surface of the receiving waters.Several commenters stated that small processors will be significantly impactedby this change to the permit. They commented that an unreasonable financialand operational burden is placed on small processors and catcher-processorvessels to meet the 0.5 inch discharge limitation. In particular, it wasnoted that trolling vessels may not have the physical space and generatorcapacity needed to operate a grinder. These vessels are highly mobile andgenerate less than 1000 pounds of seafood waste per day. It was also notedthat the discharge of small amounts of seafood waste at sea is not causingenvironmental degradation.<T3>Response: </T3>The expiring general permit for Alaskan seafood processorsexcluded from coverage facilities that discharged less than four tons perday of seafood waste at sea. However, the exclusion of processors fromthe general permit did not exempt them from the requirement to have a NPDESpermit or the requirement to meet a 0.5 inch discharge limitation. TheClean Water Act requires anyone discharging pollutants to waters of theUnited States to obtain an NPDES permit. For remote Alaskan seafood processors,EPA regulations have required compliance with a 0.5 inch discharge limitationsince their final promulgation in 1975. EPA and the state of Alaska are concerned about the large number of mediumto small discharges which have been left largely unregulated in Alaska.In addition, some environmental groups are concerned about environmentalproblems resulting from unregulated minor discharges. Rather than requiringindividual permits for small seafood processors, EPA proposed to coverall processors under the reissued general permit. This change would enablesmall processors to obtain NPDES permits without submitting lengthy applicationmaterials and completing the administrative process for reissuance of individualpermits. Currently, the state uniform application for seafood processingis accepted as the ``Notice of Intent to be Covered'' under the generalNPDES permit, and no other submittals are needed to obtain coverage. Thisgreatly reduces the paperwork burden and time requirements for the permittee.After reviewing the comments described above, we are now proposing changesto the permit with regard to coverage of small processors at sea. Thesesources are not expected to cause environmental problems. In addition,EPA acknowledges that trolling vessels may face unique problems complyingwith the general permit. Therefore, based on these comments, the proposedpermit now excludes from coverage vessels discharging less than 1000 poundsof seafood waste per day at sea. 11. <T3>Comment: </T3>On commenter noted that the expiring permit containeda clause prohibiting the discharge of floating solids ``in other than traceamounts.'' The proposed permit prohibits any discharge of floating solids.The commenter requested that the phrase ``in other than trace amounts''be restored in the permit. <T3>Response: </T3>The Alaska state standards prohibit the discharge offloating solids. There is no reference to ``trace amounts'' in the standard.Therefore, the permit remains unchanged. 12. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that the requirement for additionalbottom sampling in the Kenai River, Kasilof River and all freshwaters wasnot supported in the fact sheet. In addition, it was suggested that thelanguage under this part be clarified to read ``and all freshwaters nottidally influenced.'' <T3>Response: </T3>The Kenai and Kasilof Rivers are now excluded from coverage,based on the state certification (see comment andplusmin;17). With regardto clarification of the definition of ``freshwater,'' the term is alreadydefined in the permit as ``water not subject to tidal influences'' (partII.F).13. <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters objected to the provision prohibitingdischarges from vessels docked at or otherwise tied up to the permittee'sfacility. It was stated that permittees do not have control over the activitiesof vessels docked at a facility, since the vessels are not usually ownedby the permittee. The commenters stated that EPA must regulate vesselsdocked at processing facilities under a sepaate permit or action. Theyrecommend that this provision be deleted from this permit. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA acknowledges that discharges from vessels may bemore appropriately controlled by direct regulations of the vessels ratherthan stipulations in the processing facility's permit. Therefore, thiscondition has been deleted from the permit. However, it is important tonote that untreated seafood accumulations near a seafood processing facilityconstitute a violation of the Clean Water Act, and their proximity to theprocessor lands strong weight to the culpability of the processor. In addition,any vessel discharging seafood water without a permit (such as dumpingof ``dead loss'' near a processor) is subject to an enforcement action.Processors should monitor the actions of vessels docked at seafood processingfacilities to insure that unlawful discharges do not occur (and are reportedif they do occur). 14. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was stated that trade secrets will be revealed ifpermittees are required to submit information on processing locations andraw production of seafood. It was also commented that this informationis not necessary and that daily records are not required under individualpermits.  <T3>Response: </T3>In accordance with 40 CFR Part 2 (Public Information),any monitoring information submitted to EPA may be claimed as confidentialby the permittee. The claim must be made at the time of submission. Ifa third party requests this information, EPA will require the permitteeto submit an explanation of the casual relationship between disclosureof the information and any resulting harmful effect on the business competitiveposition. EPA will then make a determination as to whether the businessinformation is entitled to confidentiality treatment. Regarding the necessity of these submittals, permittees are required underthe NPDES program to submit to EPA the location of each outfall (40 CFR122.21). Since mobile facilities are covered by the permit, each dischargelocation must be reported. This information is also needed to determinecompliance with excluded areas in the permit. Monitoring of raw productprocessed is necessary to determine compliance with the limitation on qualityof waste discharged. Finally, individual permits do require submittal ofdaily production data in most cases. 15. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that submittal of daily processingrecords will create a paperwork burden on the processor. <T3>Response: </T3>Processing records can be summarized into a conciseformat that will not create an undo burden. 16. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was commented that the daily maximum limit on theamount of waste discharged is a limit on the production potential of afacility. <T3>Response: </T3>The maximum production capacity of the facility is notlimited to a fix level by the permit. The permit does, however, requirethe applicant to discharge in accordance with the application (Notice ofIntent to be Covered). Any increase in production capacity anticipatedby the permittee is automatically authorized, if the permittee updatesthe Notice of Intent with the new production information and EPA determinesthat the increase will not necessitate issuance of an individual permit.17. <T3>Comment: </T3>The state of Alaska requested that the Kenai River, KasilofRiver and Alsek River be excluded from coverage under the general permit.Both the Kenai and Kasilof Rivers are considered priority streams basedon their multiple uses, including sport and subsistence fishing. The statecommented that it needs to select discharge and monitoring conditions ona site-specific basis. On the Alsek River, the state has required a processorto landfill seafood wastes in order to protect a set net fishery downstreamof the processor. Since grinding of seafood wastes is unacceptable in thisarea, the state requests that this river be excluded from coverage. <T3>Response: </T3>Based on the state certification, the final permit excludesthese rivers from coverage. Individual permits will be required for thesereceiving waters. 18. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was commented that separate general permits shouldbe issued for shore-based and mobile processors, based on the differencesin the nature of the operations and the discharge locations. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA has determined that above mobile and shore-basedfacilities can be adequately covered under a single general permit. Thepermit conditions are designed to account for different processing scenarios,and these conditions would not change if the permit was to be divided inthe manner discussed. For simplicity, both are covered in the final permit.19. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was requested that the minimum depth for dischargesin areas with poor flushing be increased from 42 feet to 60 feet to protectbottom-dwelling marine resources. It was also recommended that dischargesbe located a minimum distance of one-half mile from special concern areas.<T3>Response: </T3>No evidence has been supplied to EPA indicating thatan additional 18 feet of depth at the discharge point will measurably reducethe impacts of seafood waste discharges. Therefore, this condition remainsunchanged. With regard to discharge in the vicinity of special concernareas, EPA agrees to exclude discharges within one-half mile from specialconcern areas. The permit has been changed accordingly. 20. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that wastes from herring roe strippingoperations should not be authorized for discharge; instead, EPA shouldrequire reduction of the waste to produce fish meal. Discharging of thefish carcasses was stated to be a waste of the resource. <T3>Response: </T3>EPA cannot require any limitation more stringent thanthe guideline limitation (0.5 inch size limitation), unless dischargesare causing a violation of state water quality standards. EPA has no authorityto control the use of fishery resources. By-product recovery can only berequired if reductions in the amount of waste discharged are necessaryto meet state water quality standards. 21. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that surimi processors be requiredto obtain individual permits until adequate information regarding the characteristicsof surimi wastewaters is acquired. <T3>Response: </T3>Although detailed information on the characteristicsof surimi wastewater is not available, it is expected that the contributionof nutrients from these operations is not a major component of the dischargein comparison to the ground (in most cases) seafood wastes from the filletingprocess. Therefore, EPA has determined that surimi operations will be coveredunder the general permit. It is important to note that EPA can requirean individual permit for surimi plants if these discharges are causingan adverse environmental impact. 22. <T3>Comment: </T3>It was recommended that periodic inspection of outfallsbe conducted during dive surveys to insure that breakage points are repaired.<T3>Response: </T3>The permit already requires that the dive survey reportsubmitted to EPA include a description of the outfall condition. Sincemost permittees will only perform one dive survey over the five-year termof the permit, an annual dye test of the outfall is required in order todetermine if there are any breaks in the outfall in the four remainingyears of the permit. 23. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter stated that violations of permit conditionshave been documented by dive surveys, in which large accumulations of seafoodwaste in excess of 0.5 inch in size were observed. It was stated that theseviolations have not resulted in penalties to the responsible parties. Itwas recommended that these parties be fined for violations. <T3>Response: </T3>In the past two years, EPA has fined 13 companies forviolations of seafood processing permits. Most of these penalties werelevied as a result of information collected during dive surveys at thefacilities by EPA personnel. EPA will continue to levy administrative penaltieson facilities that violate permit conditions, and the Agency encouragesoutside parties with documented evidence of violations to submit that informationto EPA.<ITAG tagnum="84">C.
