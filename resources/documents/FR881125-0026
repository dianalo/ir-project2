Therefore, a new RegulatoryFlexibility analysis has not been prepared.It has been detemined by an environmental evaluation that this action willhave no significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Therefore, neither an environmental assessment nor an Environmental ImpactStatement is needed.This program/activity is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order12372 which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and localofficials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR Part 3015, Subpart B, publishedat 48 FR 29115 (June 24, 1983).<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Background</ITAG>Section 103A(a)(5) (i) of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the``Act''), provides that the Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe byregulation:(i) A formula to define the prevailing world market price for cotton; and(ii) A mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically theprevailing world market price for cotton.The Act also provides that the prevailing world market price for cottonshall be adjusted to United States quality and location (the ``adjustedworld price''). The regulations which set forth the formula used to determinethe prevailing world market price for cotton, the mechanism for periodicallyannouncing such prevailing world market price and the procedure for adjustingthe prevailing world market price to United States quality and locationare found at 7 CFR Part 26.Northern Europe Price7 CFR 26.2 provides that the prevailing world market price for upland cottonshall be determined by the Secretary of Agriculture based upon the averageof the quotations for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the fivelowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for Middling one and three-thirty-secondinch (M 1\3/32\ inch) cotton C.I.F. (cost, insurance and freight), northernEurope (hereinafter referred to as the ``Northern Europe price''). If quotesare not available for one or more days in the five-day period, the availablequotes during the period will be used. If no quotes are available duringthe Friday through Thursday period, the prevailing world market price shallbe based upon the best available world price information, as determinedby the Secretary.Only one daily price quotation for each growth has been available for purposesof calculating the Northern Europe price. Beginning with the 1988 marketingyear, two daily price quotations will be available for each growth duringa certain period. One price quotation will be for cotton for shipment nolater than August/September of the current calendar year (hereinafter referredto as the ``current shipment price'') and the other price quotation willbe for cotton for shipment no earlier than October/November of the currentcalendar year (hereinafter referred to as the ``forward shipment price'').Forward shipment prices will be introduced during the early months of eachcalendar year. From the time of introduction through July 31 of that year,both current shipment prices and forward shipment prices will be quoteddaily. From August 1 until early the following calendar year when forwardshipment prices are again introduced, only one daily price quotation foreach growth will be available.Accordingly, it is proposed that, in determining the Northern Europe pricein accordance with andSection; 26.2 during the period when both current shipmentprices and forward shipment prices are quoted, the following procedurebe implemented which provides for a gradual transition over a six-weekperiod from using all current shipment prices to using all forward shipmentprices.Beginning with the first week covering the period Friday through Thursdaywhich includes April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipmentprices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the five lowest-pricedgrowths of the growths quoted for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northernEurope (hereinafter referred to as the ``Northern Europe current price'')and the average of the forward shipment prices for the preceding Fridaythrough Thursday for the five lowest-priced growths of the growths quotedfor M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (hereinafter referredto as the ``Northern Europe forward price'') are not available during thatperiod, beginning with the first week covering the period Friday throughThursday after the week which includes April 15 in which both the NorthernEurope current price and the Northern Europe forward price are available,the following method for calculating the Northern Europe price shall bein effect:<T3>Weeks 1 and 2</T3>: Northern Europe price=(2andmultiply;Northern Europecurrent price+Northern Europe forward price)/3.<T3>Weeks 3 and 4</T3>: Northern Europe price=(Northern Europe currentprice+Northern Europe forward price)/2.<T3>Weeks 5 and 6</T3>: Northern Europe price=(Northern Europe currentprice+2andmultiply;Northern Europe forward price)/3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">During the period covering Week 7 through July 31 of that year, theNorthern Europe price shall equal the Northern Europe forward price.The week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes April15 is proposed as the period to begin the transition from using currentshipment prices to using forward shipment prices because generally, byApril, most U.S. cotton sales for export consist of new-crop cotton. Dueto the often sizable differences between new and old crop price quotes,a six-week transition period is proposed in order to avoid a dramatic changein the adjusted world price that might occur with no transition period.Adjusting the Northern Europe Price to Average Designated U.S. Spot MarketLocation7 CFR 26.3(b)(1) provides that the adjusted world price for upland cottonshall equal the Northern Europe price, as determined in accordance withandSection; 26.2, adjusted to average U.S. quality and location as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Northern Europe price shall be adjusted to average designatedU.S. spot market location by deducting the average difference in the immediatelypreceding 52-week period between: (i) The average price quotations forthe U.S. Memphis territory and the California/Arizona territory as quotedeach Thursday for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe; and (ii)the average price of M 1\3/32\  inch (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) cottonas quoted each Thursday in the designated U.S. spot markets.</ITAG>As with the determination of the Northern Europe price which is made underandSection; 26.2, beginning with the 1988 marketing year, current shipmentprices and forward shipment prices will be quoted during a certain periodfor U.S. Memphis territory and California/Arizona territory M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe. Whenever both current shipment pricesand forward shipment prices for U.S. Memphis territory and California/Arizonaterritory M 1\3/32\  inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe are available,it is proposed that current shipment prices be used to calculate the adjustmentin the Northern Europe price to average designated U.S. spot market location.During the period when both current shipment prices and forward shipmentprices are available, current shipment prices are more comparable to theU.S. spot market quotations.Price quotations for June, July and August have not been taken into considerationin the calculation of the adjustment of the Northern Europe price to averagedesignated U.S. spot market location because there were the months duringwhich the northern Europe price quotations have historically been changedfrom old crop price quotations to new crop price quotations. The northernEurope price quotations for Memphis territory and California/Arizona territoryhave generally changed from old crop to new crop price quotations in theperiod immediately preceding August 1, the beginning of the new crop marketingyear. U.S. designated spot market quotations are for current shipment ofupland cotton. Thus, in order to ensure that the transition from old cropprice quotations to new crop price quotations did not cause undue aberrationsin the adjustment calculation, price data from weeks during which shipmentperiods may not have corresponded have been disregarded in calculatingthe adjustment in the Northern Europe price to average U.S. designatedspot market location.Use of current shipment prices in the calculation of the adjustment ofthe Northern Europe price to average designated U.S. spot market locationduring June and July should eliminate most of the transitional problems.However, there may be weeks at any time during the year when the differencebetween the average price quotations for the U.S. Memphis territory andthe California/Arizona territory as quoted each Thursday for M 1\3/32\ inch cotton C.I.F. northern Europe and the average price of M 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) cotton as quoted each Thursday in thedesignated U.S. spot markets may be substantially above or below actualtransportation costs thereby resulting in a 52-week average that is notreflective of actual costs. Therefore, in determining the 52-week averageit is proposed that any week in which the difference between the averagesof the two prices is:(1) More than 115 percent of the estimated actual costs of transportingU.S. cotton to northern Europe, then 115 percent of such estimated actualcosts shall be substituted in lieu thereof for such week. (2) Less then 85 percent of the estimated actual cost of transporting U.S.cotton to northern Europe, then 85 percent of such actual costs shall besubstituted in lieu thereof for such week.Northern Europe Coarse Count Price7 CFR 26.3(e)(1) provides that the adjusted world price, as determinedin accordance with paragraph (b) of andSection; 26.3, shall be subject tofurther adjustments as provided in this subsection with respect to anygrade of upland cotton with a staple length of 1\1/32\ inch or shorter,and to the following grades of upland cotton with a staple length of 1\1/16\inch or longer: <T3>White Grades</T3>_Strict Good Ordinary Plus, Strict Good Ordinary,Good Ordinary Plus and Good Ordinary; <T3>Light Spotted Grades</T3>_Low Middling and Strict Good Ordinary; <T3>Spotted Grades</T3>_Middling, Strict Low Middling, Low Middling andStrict Good Ordinary; <T3>Tinged Grades</T3>_Strict Middling, Middling, Strict Low Middling andLow Middling; <T3>Yellow Stained Grades</T3>_Strict Middling and Middling; <T3>Light Gray Grades</T3>_Strict Low Middling; <T3>Gray Grades</T3>_Middling and Strict Low Middling. Grade and staplelength must be determined by an official classification issued by USDA'sAgricultural Marketing Service (AMS). If no such official classificationis presented, the adjustment shall not be made.7 CFR 26.3(e)(2) provides that the adjustment for upland cotton under theprovisions of paragraph (e)(1) shall be determined by deducting from theadjusted world price: (i) The difference between the Northern Europe priceand the average of the quotations for the corresponding Friday throughThursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growths quoted for``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (hereinafter referred toas the ``Northern Europe coarse count price''), minus (ii) the differencebetween the applicable loan rate for a crop of upland cotton for M 1\3/32\inch (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) cotton and the loan rate for a crop ofupland cotton for SLM 1\3/32\ inch (micronaire 3.5 through 4.9) cotton.7 CFR 26.3(e)(3) provides that, with respect to the determination of theNorthern Europe coarse count price in accordance with paragraph (e)(2)(i)of andSection; 26.3: (1) If no quotes are available for one or more daysof the five-day period, the available quotes will be used; (ii) if quotesfor three growths are not available for any day in the five-day period,that day will not be taken into consideration; and (iii) if quotes forthree growths are not available for at least three days in the five-dayperiod, that week will not be taken into consideration, in which case theadjustment determined in accordance with subparagraph (e)(2) for the latestavailable week will continue to be applicable.As with the determination of the Northern Europe price which is made underandSection; 26.2, beginning with the 1988 marketing year, current shipmentprices and forward shipment prices will be quoted during a certain periodfor ``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe.Accordingly, it is proposed that, in determining the Northern Europe coarsecount price during the period when both current shipment prices and forwardshipment prices are quoted, the following procedure be implemented whichprovides for a gradual transition over a six-week period from using allcurrent shipment prices to using all forward shipment prices.Beginning with the first week covering the period Friday through Thursdaywhich includes April 15 or, if both the average of the current shipmentprices for the preceding Friday through Thursday for the three lowest-pricedgrowths of the growths quoted for ``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northernEurope (hereinafter referred to as the ``Northern Europe coarse count currentprice'') and the average of the forward shipment prices for the precedingFriday through Thursday for the three lowest-priced growths of the growthsquoted for ``coarse count'' cotton C.I.F. northern Europe (hereinafterreferred to as the ``Northern Europe coarse count forward price'') arenot available during that period, the first week covering the period Fridaythrough Thursday after the week which includes April 15 in which both theNorthern Europe coarse count current price and the Northern Europe coarsecount forward price are available, the following method for calculatingthe Northern Europe coarse count price shall be in effect:<T3>Weeks 1 and 2:</T3> Northern Europe coarse count price=(2andmultiply;NorthernEurope coarse count current price+Northern Europe coarse count forwardprice)/3.<T3>Weeks 3 and 4:</T3> Northern Europe coarse count price=(Northern Europecoarse count current price+Northern Europe coarse count forward price)/2.<T3>Weeks 5 and 6:</T3> Northern Europe coarse count price=(Northern Europecoarse count current price+2andmultiply;Northern Europe coarse count forwardprice)/3.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">During the period covering Week 7 through July 31 of that year, theNorthern Europe coarse count price shall equal the Northern Europe coarsecount forward price. The week covering the period Friday through Thursday which includes April15 is proposed as the period to begin the transition from using currentshipment prices to using forward shipment prices for the same reason ascited above for the determination of the Northern Europe price.Interested persons are invited to submit written comments on the proposedrules changes.
