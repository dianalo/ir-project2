The Novazza deposit lays within a welded tuff sheetof the lower unit while the Val Vedello deposit is hosted by two fracturesof the northern boundary fault system of the upper sedimentary basin.Both ore bodies are related to intense Permian hydrothermal activitywhich involved mobilization of large amounts of Na, Mg, B and F. 19 refs.;9figs.;1 table.</TEXT></DOC>
