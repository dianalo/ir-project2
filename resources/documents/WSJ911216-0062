The U.S. hasn't produced tritium -- a perishable gas usedin nuclear warheads -- since 1988, when Savannah Riverreactors were closed down for safety reasons. Mr. Watkinssaid the action &quot;culminates several years of intense effortto assure that the reactor can be brought back on linesafely.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Critics blasted the decision, contending that the reactormay be unsafe and that the tritium isn't needed anyway. It'sgenerally agreed that as a result of the dismantling ofnuclear weapons under international arms accords, the U.S.has enough tritium for several years. Last month, the EnergyDepartment announced a two-year delay in its plans to build a$6 billion tritium reactor.   Joseph Lyou, executive director of the Committee to Bridgethe Gap, a nonprofit group, said, &quot;The rush to restartSavannah River has no logical explanation.&quot; Mr. Watkins,however, has maintained that the move is needed todemonstrate the viability of the so-called K reactor and thenation's ability to produce tritium.   A department spokesman said Westinghouse Electric Corp.,the contractor that runs Savannah River, will conductequipment and safety tests before bringing the reactor up to30% capacity, a rate the department has said is sufficient todemonstrate the reactor's reliability.</TEXT></DOC>
