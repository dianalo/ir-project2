The Asian republics, a vast goulash of peoples andlong-festering problems, contain not only key elements of theSoviet nuclear arsenal, but also the experts who know thetechnology. And these republics, including Azerbaijan,Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenia, Tajikistan and Kirgizia,are already building economic and political ties with thevolatile neighboring nations of the Middle East and SouthAsia.</LP><TEXT>   The result, U.S. analysts worry, is that the now-porousborder may become a conduit for nuclear-weapons engineers andother unemployed military experts seeking lucrative jobs insuch nations as Iraq, Iran, Israel, Pakistan and Libya, whichare spending billions to acquire weapons of mass destruction.   &quot;The whole border is a nightmare,&quot; says Robert Legvold,the director of Columbia University's Harriman Institute forSoviet Studies. Not only is there the danger of nucleartechnology migrating southward, but also danger that theinstability rampant in the Middle East &quot;now has theopportunity to move north.&quot;   Mr. Legvold worries that tensions and conflicts keptbottled up during decades of Communist rule could well erupton a variety of fronts. Already, he says, Turkey is believedto be selling arms to the Azerbaijanis, Syrians have beenholding meetings with Islamic groups in the NorthernCaucasus, and the mullahs of Iran are mobilizing to spreadtheir fundamentalist religion northward.   The danger isn't just that existing nuclear weapons couldfall into the wrong hands. It is also the flow of nuclearexperts taking their knowledge with them. Pakistan, forinstance, is a &quot;primitive nuclear state&quot; that would have atremendous amount to learn from Soviet engineers who know howto miniaturize nuclear weapons and mount them onprecision-guided missiles.   U.S. government experts say Kazakhstan is currently themajor nuclear power in the region. It has SS-18 missilefields, a long-range bomber base and a number of scientificinstitutions where weapons scientists work.   In addition, the experts say, other border states maystill have small remnants of the estimated 27,000-warheadSoviet nuclear arsenal -- most likely nuclear-tippedsurface-to-air missiles, part of a long chain of air-defensesystems designed to defend the border against U.S. B-52bombers.   &quot;This is going to be the most difficult part of the{Soviet} problem for us to grasp,&quot; says Kurt M. Campbell, aHarvard University professor who formerly served as a Sovietanalyst for the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff. &quot;We have nonotion of what goes on in many of these places.&quot;   Some places are what Mr. Legvold calls &quot;Stalin's timebombs,&quot; ethnic groups still embittered from the pain ofmistreatment by the Soviet dictator during World War II thatmay now seize the opportunity to strike back. One that isalready exploding is the &quot;Chechen-Ingush AutonomousRepublic,&quot; a 1.3 million-person enclave in the Caucasus whereGen. Dzhokar Dudayev has declared independence from Russiaand is busy arming a 3,000-man militia with weapons purchasedfrom Hungary.   Gen. Dudayev formerly commanded a Soviet nuclear-bomberdivision in Estonia, but when President Mikhail Gorbachevbrought the nuclear weapons back, the general used hismilitary prominence to win election as the leader of theChechens. &quot;Potentially, you may have some violent clashes,&quot;explains Sergei Zamascikov, a former Soviet military officer,now an analyst at Rand Corp. The Chechens, he explained, wereexiled by Stalin to Siberia after a 1943 uprising.   Then there are the 30 million Uzbeks, he points out, whohave long-standing feuds with their neighbors in Kazakhstanand Turkmenia.   Lenin and Stalin created most of the borders in the area,some of which, he says, have been changed 50 times. &quot;A lot ofthem are disputed because they're arbitrarily drawn.&quot;   There is also a rich potential for religious squabbles,the chief one of which may stem from Iran's attempt toproselytize the north with Shiite fundamentalism. Iran'sMujahadeen Khalq, a dissident group, has reported thatIranian leaders have allocated the equivalent of $130 millionto send mullahs and political and religious propagandanorthward. Their main target is neighboring Azerbaijan.   That, in turn, has attracted the interest of more moderatereligious leaders in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia. They havebeen sending their own missionaries armed with boxes ofKorans north to counter Iran's campaign, according to GrahamFuller, another Rand Corp. analyst.   Mr. Fuller, who retired from the Central IntelligenceAgency in 1987, says the West so far has been suffering froma huge void in intelligence about the region. When he wasstill at the CIA, he recalls, &quot;we didn't write high-levelpolicy estimates about the region because there were nopolicy issues to talk about.&quot;   The CIA is scrambling to fill that void, he says: &quot;Theyare now vividly aware of the problems and are devoting avastly greater proportion of their resources on them thanthey ever have before.&quot; But Mark Saroyan, a HarvardUniversity specialist in the area, says everyone -- includingthe experts -- still has much to learn. In the past, Mr.Saroyan says, even the little information coming out of thesouthern republics was often distorted as it was funnelledthrough Moscow and then into the U.S. press.   Mr. Saroyan cites one cryptic news report that had 10,000people from Azerbaijan inexplicably crossing the border intoIran. Analysts wondered if there was some majorethnic-religious event -- or maybe even the beginnings of aninvasion.   Further research provided a more prosaic answer. It was,says Mr. Saroyan, &quot;a big exhibit of Turkish consumerproducts.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
