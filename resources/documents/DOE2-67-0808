<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0808 </DOCNO><TEXT>Within the general framework of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer pairing theorywe derive coupled gap equations of the Helfand-Werthamer type for twoor more order-parameter components having different symmetry. Assuming,for instance, coupled s- and d-wave pairing components, we obtain forcertain parameter values a solution for H/sub c/{sub 2} perpendicularto the Cu-O planes which accounts qualitatively for the observed upwardcurvature and yields about 65 T at zero temperature. We calculate alsothe in-plane fluctuation conductivity of the Lawrence-Doniach type forfields parallel to the c axis. For large fields, the inverse fluctuationconductivity is almost linear in temperature with slope depending sensitivelyon the ratio of coherence length to unit-cell dimension along the c axis.It seems possible to fit the observed broad resistive transition fordifferent fields with this inverse fluctuation conductivity. Just abovethe transition temperature, T/sub c/{sub 2}(H), the inverse ac fluctuationconductivity is approximately a linear function of frequency for smallfields, and it is nearly a quadratic function of frequency for largefields. The field dependence of the fluctuation contribution to the specificheat is also discussed in connection with recent measurements.</TEXT></DOC>
