(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pat Robertson defended himself againstPresident Reagan's critical comments Thursday, saying his ChristianBroadcasting Network did give the administration information onAmerican hostages in 1985. Robertson said he mentioned it Wednesdaymerely as ``a throwaway line.''   Reacting to Reagan's public skepticism, Robertson said at aLouisville campaign stop, ``I wasn't meaning to start some majorconfrontation with a person I admire tremendously, but obviouslythe State Department must have dismissed what we had to say, orelse they didn't refer it up the line to the president.''   Later, at a stop in Birmingham, Ala., Robertson said of hisstatements about having known the hostages whereabouts, ``I usedthat as a throwaway line'' to illustrate that the nation needed toimprove its methods of dealing with terrorists.   He said it was ``hard to understand why there has been such anincredible flap.''   State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley said she had noimmediate response to Robertson's newest comments about havinggiving information to the department but would look into the matterfurther.   Reagan, during his nationally broadcast news conferenceWednesday night, questioned Robertson's contentions that in 1985 hehad known the whereabouts of hostages in the Middle East ``wherethey could have been rescued.''   ``It'd be very strange if he actually did have information as tothe location of those hostages,'' Reagan said. ``Isn't it strangethat no one in our administration was ever apprised of that?''   ``If he thought that he knew, he kept it to himself,'' Reaganadded.   Robertson, campaigning in Louisville on Thursday, complainedthat what he had said about the hostages ``was, I'm afraid,misinterpreted.''   In Atlanta on Wednesday, the Republican presidential candidatehad said, ``We identified in our news department at CBN thelocation of those hostages in Lebanon very shortly after they weretaken, and they were in a position where they could have beenrescued. They were in Beirut, and they could have been freed.''   Robertson did not say which hostages he was talking about.   Nine Americans are in captivity in Lebanon, including Marine Lt.Col. William R. Higgins, who was captured last week. TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,is the longest-held captive; he was kidnapped on March 16, 1985.   A CBN spokesman, Benton Miller, later said the former televisionevangelist's comments pertained to hostages who had been taken fromTWA Flight 847 in Beirut in June 1985.   One passenger, Navy diver Robert Stethem, was killed after theplane was hijacked. The passengers kept as hostages after the planelanded in Beirut were later released.   ``The State Department, from what my staff tells me, did inquireof us concerning what knowledge we had of that TWA hijacking,''Robertson said Thursday. ``Our reporter did identify the names ofthe captors and identified them as being close to Nabih Berri andwhat is called Hezbollah.''   ``We knew the captors and we had the basic area of Beirut wherethey were being held,'' he said.   A State Department expert on terrorism has said such informationprobably would not be enough to mount a rescue effort.   Robertson's comments on Wednesday were criticized by two of hisRepublican presidential rivals, Vice President George Bush and Rep.Jack Kemp of New York.   Bush, said, ``My question would be, how come he didn't get holdof the proper authorities in the United States government that wereworking day and night, trying to figure out how they could getthese people out?''   Kemp, in a statement, called Robertson's statementsirresponsible and said he should ``apologize to the families of thehostages whom he has needlessly hurt in an attempt to gainpublicity.''</TEXT></DOC>
