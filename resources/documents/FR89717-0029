Communicationsmust identify the notice number of this NPRM. Persons interested in beingplaced on a mailing list for future NPRMs should also request a copy ofAdvisory Circular No. 11-2A which describes the application procedures.<ITAG tagnum="84">History </ITAG>The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA), authority for this rule, was enactedby the 96th Congress (Pub. L. 96-481, 94 Stat, 2325, 5 U.S.C. 504 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and amended by the 99th Congress (Pub. L. 99-80, 99 Stat.183). It provides for the award of attorney fees and other expenses toeligible individuals and entities who are parties to administrative proceedingsbefore government agencies and who prevail over the government. These proceedingsare conducted under section 554 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).Eligible prevailing parties are entitled to awards of attorney fees andother expenses, unless the adjudicative officer or judge of the proceedingfinds that the position of the United States is substantially justifiedor that special circumstances make an award unjust. Under the EAJA, eligible parties include individuals with a net worth ofnot more than $2 million; sole owners of unincorporated businesses, partnerships,corporations, associations, or organizations with a net worth of not morethan $7 million and not more than 500 employees; and tax-exempt charitable,educational or religious associations as defined by the Agricultural MarketingAct with not more than 500 employees regardless of net worth. The Act directsagencies to establish uniform procedures for the submission and considerationof fee and expense applications. Section 554 of the APA applies in everycase of adjudication required by statute to be determined on the recordafter opportunity for an agency hearing. In response to the EAJA, the Administrative Conference of the United States(ACUS) published model EAJA regulations on which it requested comments(46 FR 15895). After considering all comments submitted, ACUS publishedfinal model EAJA regulations on June 25, 1981 (46 FR 32900). A slightlydifferent set of model EAJA regulations was published by the Departmentof Justice (DOJ) on April 13, 1982 (47 FR l5774). The FAA has patternedits EAJA regulations after the ACUS and DOJ model rules (which served asthe model for the EAJA regulations of the Department of Transportationand the National Transportation Safety Board [48 FR 1068 and 46 FR 48208respectively]). The FAA is adopting EAJA regulations at this time because it is now, forthe first time, conducting proceedings to which the EAJA applies. On August31, 1988, the FAA implemented the provisions of section 204(g) of the Airportand Airway Safety and Capacity Expansion Act of 1987 (Pub. L. 100-223)by issuing the Rules of Practice for FAA Civil Penalty Actions (53 FR 34646;September 7, 1988). Such regulations provide the procedural framework forthe FAA to assess civil penalties (not to exceed $50,000) for violationsarising under the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1471<T3>et seq.</T3>), or a rule, regulation, or order issued thereunder, afterwritten notice and a finding of violation by an FAA Decisionmaker. Theseregulations, which were enacted to provide for effective enforcement ofthe FAA's safety regulations, enable the FAA to conduct proceedings ofthe type covered by section 554 of the APA. The FAA's EAJA regulationsapply only to those proceedings required to be brought pursuant to theFAA's ``Civil Penalty Assessment Demonstration Program,'' as codified in14 CFR 13.201(a)(1). In the FAA's disposition of comments received following the publicationof the procedural regulations on September 7, 1988 (54 FR 11914), the FAAaddressed the concerns of four commenters that the regulations did notprovide procedures for the award of attorney fees and other expenses underEAJA. At that time, the FAA stated that it would undertake a separate rulemakingproject to prescribe the procedures governing EAJA awards. Prior to theimplementation of the above-referenced regulations, the FAA did not conductadversary adjudications to which EAJA applied. Economic Summary The rule sets out procedures which eligible prevailing parties must followto apply for and receive EAJA awards. The rule will facilitate filing applicationsfor EAJA awards and, consequently, reduce costs to the applicant. Sincethis rule does not impose any costs on applicants, the impact of the ruleis minimal and no full Regulatory Evaluation is necessary. Trade Impact Assessment  The rule will have no impact on international trade. The subject of therule is unrelated to the manufacture or distribution of aviation-relatedproducts and services either by United States-based manufacturers and aircarriers or foreign-based manufacturers and air carriers. Regulatory Impact Determination Additionally, the rule will not have a significant economic impact on theoperating costs of those small entities filing applications for EAJA awardswith the FAA. There may be some small benefit to small entities by facilitatingfiling for awards, but this will not be substantial. Therefore, the ruleis not expected to have a significant economic impact, positive or negative.Accordingly, a regulatory flexibility analysis is not required.Federalism Impact The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion </ITAG>To the extent that this proposal will have an economic effect on airmen,it will only be a minimal positive one since it will facilitate the filingfor EAJA awards. Therefore, the FAA has determined that this proposal involvesa proposed regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 orsignificant under the De0artment of Transportation Regulatory Policiesand Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). For this same reason,it is certified that under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Actthe proposed rule, if adopted, will not have a significant economic impact,positive or negative, on a substantial number of entities. Because of theabsence of any costs attendant with the proposal, the FAA has determinedthat the expected impact of the proposed regulations is so minimal thatthey do not warrant a full regulatory evaluation. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 14 </ITAG>Equal access to justice, Lawyers. <ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration proposes to add Part 14 of the Federal Aviation Regulations(14 CFR Part 14) to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="56">PART 14_RULES IMPLEMENTING THE EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACT OF 1980</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart A_General Provisions </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.1 Purpose of these rules. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.2 Proceedings covered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.3 Eligibility of applicants. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.4 Standards for awards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.5 Allowable fees and expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart B_Information Required From Applicants </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.10 Contents of application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.11 Net worth exhibit. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.12 Documentation of fees and expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart C_Procedures for Considering Applications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.20 When an application may be filed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.21 Filing and service of documents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.22 Answer to application. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.23 Reply. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.24 Comments by other parties. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.25 Settlement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.26 Further proceedings. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.27 Decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.28 Review by FAA Decisionmaker. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.29 Judicial review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">14.30 Payment of award.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Equal Access to Justice Act (Pub.

An eligible party mayreceive an award when it prevails over the FAA, unless the agency's positionin the proceeding was substantially justified or special circumstancesmake an award unjust. The rules in this part describe the parties eligiblefor awards and the proceedings that are covered. They also explain howto apply for awards, and the procedures and standards that the FAA Decisionmakerwill use to make them. As used hereinafter, the term ``agency'' appliesto the FAA. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 14.2</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Proceedings covered. </ITAG>(a) The Act applies to certain adversary adjudications conducted by theFAA. These are adjudications under 5 U.S.C. 554 in which the position ofthe FAA is represented by an attorney or other representative who entersan appearance and participates in the proceeding. This subpart appliesto proceedings in which a civil penalty action was initiated by the FAAafter September 7, 1988, pursuant to 14 CFR 13.201(a)(1). (b) The Act further applies to any FAA action or failure to act which isthe basis for an adversary adjudication, as herein defined.(c) The FAA Decisionmaker may also designate a proceeding not listed inparagraph (b) of this section as an adversary adjudication for purposesof the Act by so stating in an order initiating the proceeding or designatingthe matter for hearing. The FAA Decisionmaker's failure to designate aproceeding as an adversary adjudication shall not preclude the filing ofan application by a party who believes the proceeding is covered by theAct; whether the procedure is covered will then be an issue for resolutionin proceedings on the application. (d) If a proceeding includes both matters covered by the Act and mattersspecifically excluded from coverage, any award made will include only feesand expenses related to covered issues. (e) Fees and other expenses may not be awarded to a party for any portionof the adversary adjudication in which such party has unreasonably protractedthe proceedings. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 14.3</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Eligibility of applicants. </ITAG>(a) To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses underthe Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication forwhich it seeks an award. The term ``party'' is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3).The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility setout in this subpart and in subpart B. (b) The types of eligible applicants are as follows: (1) An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million at the timethe adversary adjudication was initiated;(2) The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth ofnot more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests,and not more than 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudicationwas initiated; (3) A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not morethan 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated;and (4) A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the AgriculturalMarketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500 employees atthe time the adversary adjudication was initiated; and (5) Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or privateorganization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and not morethan 500 employees at the time the adversary adjudication was initiated.(c) For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employeesof an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.(d) An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be consideredan ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an unincorporated business''if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily topersonal interests rather than to business interest. (e) The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly performservices for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's directionand control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.(f) The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of itsaffiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual,corporation, or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or ownsa majority of the voting shares or other inte2est of the applicant, orany corporation or other entity of which the applicant directly or indirectlyowns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, willbe considered an affiliate for purposes of this part, unless the administrativelaw judge determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary tothe purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between theaffiliated entities. In addition, the administrative law judge may determinethat financial relationships of the applicant, other than those describedin this paragraph, constitute special circumstances that would make anaward unjust. (g) An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalfof one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is notitself eligible for an award. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 14.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Standards for awards. </ITAG>(a) A prevailing applicant may receive an award for attorney fees and otherexpenses incurred in connection with a proceeding, or in a significantand discrete substantive portion of the proceeding, unless the positionof the agency over which the applicant has prevailed was substantiallyjustified. Whether or not the position of the FAA was substantially justifiedshall be determined on the basis of the record (including the record withrespect to the action or failure to act by the agency upon which the civilaction is based) which was made in the civil action for which fees andother expenses are sought. The burden of proof that an award should notbe made to an eligible prevailing applicant is on the agency counsel, whomay avoid an award by showing that the agency's position was reasonablein law and fact. (b) An award will be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly or unreasonablyprotracted the proceeding or if special circumstances make the award soughtunjust. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 14.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Allowable fees and expenses. </ITAG>(a) Awards will be based on rates customarily charged by persons engagedin the business of acting as attorneys, agents, and expert witnesses, evenif the services were made available without charge or at a reduced rateto the applicant. (b) No award for the fee of an attorney or agent under these rules mayexceed $75 per hour. No award to compensate an ex0ert witness may exceedthe highest rate at which the agency pays expert witnesses, However, anaward may also include the reasonable expenses of the attorney, agent,or witness as a separate item, if the attorney, agent, or witness ordinarilycharges clients separately for such expenses.(c) In determining the reasonableness of the fee sought for an attorney,agent, or expert witness, the administrative law judge shall consider thefollowing: (1) If the attorney, agent, or witness is in private practice, his or hercustomary fee for similar services, or if an employee of the applicant,the fully allocated cost of the services; (2) The prevailing rate for similar services in the community in whichthe attorney, agent, or witness ordinarily performs services; (3) The time actually spent in the representation of the applicant. (4) The time reasonably spent in light of the difficulty or complexityof the issues in the proceeding; and (5) Such other factors as may bear on the value of the services provided.(d) The reasonable cost of any study, analysis, engineering report, test,project, or similar matter prepared on behalf of a party may be awarded,to the extent that the charge for the service does not exceed the prevailingrate for similar services, and the study or other matter was necessaryfor preparation of the applicant's case. (e) Fees may be awarded only for work performed after designation of aproceeding. <ITAG tagnum="52">Subpart B_Information Required From Applicants </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 14.10 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Contents of application.  </ITAG>(a) An application for an award of fees and expenses under the Act shallidentify the applicant and the proceeding for which an award is sought.The application shall show that the applicant has prevailed and identifythe position of the agency in the proceeding that the applicant allegeswas not substantially justified. Unless the applicant is an individual,the application shall also state the number of employees of the applicantand describe briefly the type and purpose of its organization or business.(b) The application shall also include a statement that the applicant'snet worth does not exceed $2 million (if an individual) or $7 million (forall other applicants, including their affiliates) at the time the adversaryadjudication was initiated.

(c) The application shall state the amount of fees and expenses for whichan award is sought. (d) The application may also include any other matters that the applicantwishes this agency to consider in determining whether and in what amountan award should be made.

If any individual, corporation, or other entity directly orindirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interestof the applicant, or if the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controlsa majority of the voting shares or other interest of any corporation orother entity, the exhibit must include a showing of the net worth of allsuch affiliates or of the applicant including the affiliates. The exhibitmay be in any form convenient to the applicant that provides full disclosureof the applicant's and its affiliates' assets and liabilities and is sufficientto determine whether the applicant qualifies under the standards in thispart. The administrative law judge may require an applicant to file additionalinformation to determine the eligibility for an award. (b) The net worth exhibit shall describe any transfers of assets from,or obligations incurred by, the applicant or any affiliate, occurring inthe one-year period prior to the date on which the proceeding was initiated,that reduced the net worth of the applicant and its affiliates below theapplicable net worth transactions, the applicant shall so state. (c) Ordinarily, the net worth exhibit will be included in the public recordof the proceeding. However, an applicant that objects to public disclosureof information in any portion of the exhibit and believes there are legalgrounds for withholding it from disclosure may submit that portion of theexhibit directly to the administrative law judge in a sealed envelop labeled``Confidential Financial Information,'' accompanied by a motion to withholdthe information from public disclosure. The motion shall describe the informationsought to be withheld and explain, in detail, why it falls within one ormore of the specific exemptions from mandatory disclosure under the Freedomof Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(1)-(9), why public disclosure of theinformation would adversely affect the applicant, and why disclosure isnot required in the public interest. The material in question shall beserved on counsel representing the agency against which the applicant seeksan award, but need not be served on any other party to the proceeding.If the administrative law judge finds that the information should not bewithheld from disclosure, it shall be placed in the public record of theproceeding. Otherwise, any request to inspect or copy the exhibit shallbe disposed of in accordance with the FAA's established procedures underthe Freedom of Information Act as implemented by 49 CFR 7, Appendix C ofthe FAA's rules. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 14.12 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Documentation of fees and expenses. </ITAG>The application shall be accompanied by full documentation of the feesand expenses, including the cost of any study, analysis, engineering report,test, project or similar matter, for which an award is sought.
