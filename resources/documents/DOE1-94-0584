This theoreticalanalysis of problems is done from the viewpoint of a resource-exportingcountry. The overall aim is to develop standardised means-end combinationsor, if necessary outline the limits of a governmental resource-exportpolicy and make these two instruments available to the political instancesresponsible for export policies. The second part of the book casts acritical eye at the reference countries implementation of export policies.Coal export serves as an example for analysing the practical forms thatresource export policies can take. This is followed by a critical evaluationof what happens in practice and further specific problems. Finally themain chapters of the book are summarized and critically evaluated ina comparative and contrastive analysis of the reference countries withspecial attention, to the three major problems, e.g. interdependenceof foreign trade relations, sectoral structures and environment - connectedwith the export of resources. Theoretical claims and political realityare judged by the yardstick of the theories of failure of market andpolitics.</TEXT></DOC>
