Biological response modifiers (BRMs) arethose agents or approaches that modify the relationship between the tumorand host by modifying the host's biological response to tumor cells withresultant therapeutic effects. Most of the early work with BRMs centeredaround observations of spontaneous tumor regression and the associationof tumor regression with concurrent bacterial infections. The BRM canmodify the host response by increasing the host's antitumor responsesthrough augmentation and/or restoration of effector mechanisms or mediatorsof the host's defense or decrease the deleterious component by the host'sreaction, increasing the host's defenses by the administration of naturalbiologics (or the synthetic derivatives thereof) as effectors or mediatorsof an antitumor response, augmenting the host's response to modifiedtumor cells or vaccines, which might stimulate a greater response bythe host or increase tumor-cell sensitivity to an existing response,decreasing the transformation and/or increase differentiation (maturation)of tumor cells, or increasing the ability of the host to tolerate damageby cytotoxic modalities of cancer treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
