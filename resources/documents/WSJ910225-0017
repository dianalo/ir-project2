The official said that &quot;a considerable amount&quot; of thegear, which can be installed on tanks and possibly aircraft,was shipped to Iraq by Delft Instruments N.V., Delft,Holland. The official said that some Delft night-visionequipment was found by allied forces after their clash withIraqi troops in the Saudi Arabian town of Khafji, but he saidit wasn't certain whether that gear contained Hughes parts.</LP><TEXT>   Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., said that it soldDelft infrared imaging sensors, a critical component in thenight-vision gear. Hughes said it supplied the Dutch companywith &quot;less than a thousand&quot; of the infrared detectors for useby the Dutch military and wasn't aware of any diversions toIraq. The U.S. concern declined to put a dollar value on itscontract with Delft.   Delft officials couldn't be reached for comment yesterday.But a Delft official last week denied any wrongdoing,according to the Associated Press.   Acting on evidence turned up by Defense Departmentinvestigators, the State Department, which licensed thesales, last month ordered Hughes to stop delivering theinfrared detectors to Delft. The Commerce Department,meanwhile, expanded the restrictions; on Friday, it blockedall U.S. exports to Delft and its subsidiaries for at least180 days.   Commerce Department officials said that Delft and aBrussels-based subsidiary, OIP Instrubel, were suspected ofsending the night-vision gear to Iraq without the requiredU.S. approval. &quot;In the department's view, the suspectedviolations were significant and deliberate,&quot; said DennisKloske, undersecretary for export administration. &quot;We believethere is unacceptable risk that if these companies continuedto receive sensitive equipment, they would re-export it inviolation of U.S. export laws.&quot;   Under U.S. law, Delft would have been required to seekpermission from the State Department to sell theHughes-supplied infrared detectors to Iraq. But according toU.S. officials, there is no record that Delft sought suchauthority.   The senior U.S. official, who asked not to be identified,said the Pentagon's Defense Technology SecurityAdministration, even before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,suspected that Delft was illegally sending U.S.-made gear toSaddam Hussein's regime. He said the agency beganinvestigating Delft after a Dutch newspaper reported lastsummer that Delft may have sent equipment to Baghdad afterthe United Nations embargo of Iraq.   The Pentagon agency uncovered &quot;reliable information,&quot; theofficial said, that Delft night-vision equiment &quot;had beenexported to Iraq&quot; for at least five years. He said thatalthough Dutch authorities have known of the allegedshipments for months, they have yet to complete theirinvestigation.   The official said that Hughes, which is cooperating withU.S. inquiries, can account for the infrared detectors itsold to Delft. But the official said the company didn't checkon how Delft was using the equipment.   A Hughes spokesman said Hughes's licensing agreement withDelft &quot;specifically prohibits&quot; the Dutch concern fromtransferring technology to Iraq without the written consentof the U.S. government. He said the detectors were to be usedin thermal imaging devices that Delft makes for the Dutcharmy.   ---   David J. Jefferson in Los Angeles contributed to thisarticle.</TEXT></DOC>
