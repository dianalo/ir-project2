The charge is expected to reduce net income for the year by about 36 cents a share, the company said.    The Columbus, Ohio-based utility said the charge stems from a write-off of a portion of its Columbus Southern Power Co. unit's investment in the Zimmer Generating Station in Cincinnati, which is being converted from nuclear power to coal power operation.    The write-off was necessitated in 1985, when Ohio regulators ruled that Columbus Southern and two other Zimmer owners couldn't impose rate increases to recover $861 million spent on the facility when it was being built as a nuclear plant.    Columbus Southern took a $66.3 million portion of the write-off in 1985 and deferred the balance pending the outcome of a lawsuit brought by the Zimmer owners against General Electric Co. and co-defendant Sargent andamp; Lundy Engineers. The suit alleged that GE and Sargent were responsible for certain defects in the design of the plant.    The fourth-quarter charge was necessitated when Columbus Southern received $21.4 million in the settlement, far less than its portion of the $415 million sought by the three utilities.    American Electric reported net income of $151.1 million, or 78 cents a share, on revenue of $1.20 billion in the year-earlier fourth quarter, and net income of $507.2 million, or $2.62 a share, on revenue of $4.85 billion for all of 1986. </TEXT></DOC>
