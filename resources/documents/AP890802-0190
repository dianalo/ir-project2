(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An Arcadia fruit picker who spent more than21 years in prison for the 1967 poisoning deaths of his sevenchildren is filing a $35 million lawsuit for being wronglyconvicted, his attorneys said Wednesday.   James Richardson was freed last April after a stateinvestigation ordered by Gov. Bob Martinez found that suppressedevidence and perjured testimony was used to convict the 53-year-oldfarm worker.   Richardson stood trial only for the slaying of his oldest childand was sentenced to die in the electric chair. The sentence wascommuted to life in prison when the U.S. Supreme Court struck downthe death penalty in 1972.   Attorneys in Sarasota were to file Richardson's suit Thursday inU.S. District Court in Tampa.   The lawsuit names the state of Florida, DeSoto County, formerState Attorney Frank Schaub and former DeSoto Sheriff Frank Cline.The 22-page complaint includes five separate counts ofconstitutional and civil rights violations and racketeeringactivities on the part of Schaub and Cline.   Roger Young, one of Richardson's attorneys, conceded it wasdifficult placing a dollar amount on the time Richardson spent inprison.   ``It's hard. You can't really do it,'' Young said. ``He waswithout his family, loss of liberty and everything that'sguaranteed to him by the constitution. Those things were allstripped from him because of the actions of Frank Schaub.''   The suit charges Schaub and Cline furthered a conspiracy toconvict Richardson at all costs.   ``They manufactured evidence, witnesses were threatened and theyknowingly used perjured testimony to convict Richardson,'' Youngsaid.   Schaub, who retired in January, prosecuted the case in 1968 andblasted Special Prosecutor Janet Reno for concluding thatRichardson probably was wrongfully accused. Ms. Reno announced inMay that the state would not retry Richardson, whose sentence wasvacated April 25.   Neither Schaub nor Cline were immediately available for comment.   The suit seeks to compensate Richardson for mental anguish, lossof the capacity for the enjoyment of life, loss of income, pain andsuffering and loss of his liberty and rights as a citizen of theUnited States.   Since his release from a state prison near Daytona Beach,Richardson has worked at a diet clinic run by former comedian DickGregory in Fort Walton Beach. Richardson was expected to comment onthe suit at a news conference scheduled for Thursday in Sarasota.   Richardson was initially jailed on charges of poisoning hisseven children to collect insurance money. Six of the children,ages 2 to 8, died Oct. 25, 1967, after eating a pesticide-lacedlunch. The seventh child died the next day.   Richardson and his wife, Annie Mae, were out in the orangegroves at the time.   The suit said Schaub and Cline continued to pursue the insurancemotive, even though the evidence showed that there had never beenan insurance policy taken out.   Cline also suppressed all evidence implicating Bessie Reese, ababy sitter who served the fatal lunch to the children, the suitcharges. In recent years, Ms. Reese confessed to the killings, butthat confession was thrown out because she was ruled mentallyincompetent.   ``Sheriff Frank Cline manipulated the evidence to exonerate amurderer and Frank Schaub conspired with him to do so from thebeginning of the investigation and continues to do so to thisday,'' according to the suit.   Ms. Reno, the Dade County state attorney appointed by thegovernor to investigate the allegations, found evidence of trialerrors and called the murder investigation ``totally inadequate andincomplete.''</TEXT></DOC>
