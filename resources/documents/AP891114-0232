The most alarming reports come from the Labor Department'sinspector general's office, which says failure to shore up the lawsand bolster enforcement could result in a taxpayer-funded bailoutdwarfing the recent savings and loan crisis.   ``There's an insidious and steady siphoning off, whichultimately affects the employees,'' says Raymond Maria, actinginspector general for the Labor Department. ``I am convinced thereis substantial fraud and abuse.''   An Associated Press investigation found that at least one-fourthof the private pension plans audited by the government are inviolation of the law _ yet the odds of any individual program beingchecked are less than one in a hundred.   The department has just 300 inspectors to police the nation's870,000 private pension plans. But instances of fraud and abusethat already have come to light are touching off alarms inWashington.   In some cases, pension administrators have siphoned off millionsof dollars by underreporting earnings. In others, employers nevermade required contributions, with pensioners discovering only uponretirement that the money was missing. Still other companies havesimply dumped their pension obligations on a government insuranceprogram that already is $1.5 billion in the red.   What makes the system most vulnerable, officials say, is itssize.   Frequently described as ``the largest lump of money in theworld,'' the nation's private pension plans hold assets of $2trillion, or roughly $8,000 for every man, woman and child in theUnited States. Those funds cover some 76 million participants.   The Labor Department audited 1,553 plans in 1989, withviolations found in 492, or almost one-third. A similar rate wasfound in 1988 audits, after three years in which the violation ratewas about 25 percent.   The government is the final insurer of many private pensionassets through the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The PBGC,which receives most of its funds from pension plan premiums, posteda $1.5 billion deficit in 1988, and a General Accounting Officestudy predicted that the corporation would be insolvent by 2001.   Congress is investigating the stability of the insurance system,which the Office of Management and Budget recently put on a list ofhigh-risk programs.   Most PBGC claims have come from the beleaguered steel industry.But executive director James B. Lockhart recently cautioned thecorporation's deficit could double if the agency has to bail outthe major airlines undergoing financial difficulties.   ``If they go bust, the taxpayer picks up the bill _ just likethe Sandamp;Ls,'' said Joe McGowan of the inspector general's office.   The government's ability to legislate pension safety is limitedbecause the plans exist solely at the discretion of employers, whoin some cases drop the retirement programs rather than reform them.   Plus, only 40 million pensioners in 107,000 private plans arecovered by the PBGC. Most of the others have no insurance at all.   Karen Ferguson, director of the Pension Rights Center, a publicinterest group, points out that detection of fraud is slim, withonly about 1 percent of the submitted plans subject to LaborDepartment audits.   ``It's astonishing how much of the money is being stolen,'' Ms.Ferguson said. ``The pension money is sitting there and nobody'slooking.''   In just one New York case, investigators concluded that some $14million had been stolen from two union locals by a broker and afinancial adviser. The Labor Department says Mario Renda and MartinJ. Schwimmer made the money by soliciting kickbacks on $100 millionin investments.   But the concern is by no means limited to large institutionalprograms. Ms. Ferguson says one typical case was found in adentist's office.   ``The receptionist wanted to retire but found the pension moneywasn't there,'' she explained. ``The dentist made loans to himselfand invested in Florida land.''   According to documents obtained under the Freedom of InformationAct, the inspector general's office in late 1987 investigated 168pension and welfare plans and found $18.7 million in misused assetsand administrative violations.   Congress in 1974 enacted the Employment Retirement IncomeSecurities Act, known as ERISA, to protect pension and welfare planassets. The act established standards for how the plans were to beoperated in the interests of the participants.   Officials say the majority of big business pension funds arestable and well run. Nonetheless, the complexities of theEmployment Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, or ERISA,coupled with the huge number of pensions leave many plans open tofraud.   The Labor Department's Pension Welfare Benefits Administration,responsible for enforcing ERISA rules, has only 300 inspectors.   Maria wants to put more of the burden on private accountants,who under ERISA audit large plans yearly. He would require them toreport any prohibited transactions directly to the Labor Department.   But the best way to avoid fraud and embezzlement, Maria said, isto bring more criminal charges and fewer civil suits.   ``I submit it is the jail term that is the deterrent, not thefine,'' he said. ``Today there's no stigma to being a defendant ina civil suit.''   The Pension Welfare Benefits Administration conducted 5,000investigations of pension and welfare benefit plans over the lastthree years, with just 95 classified as criminal. There were 26convictions.   The inspector general's Office of Labor Racketeering, incomparison, has obtained 179 criminal convictions since 1986. Butthat office is barred by a March Justice Department opinion frominvestigating non-union plans.   The Labor Department's deputy secretary, Roderick DeArment,insists that ``pensioners shouldn't be alarmed.''   ``We don't have a savings and loan crisis in the pensionindustry,'' he said.   Still, DeArment said he is carefully looking at the inspectorgeneral's reports. Even though he doesn't believe the system isabout to collapse, ``that doesn't mean we shouldn't address thepotential,'' he said.   Lisa Phillips, an aide to Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., said thewarnings cannot be ignored.   ``We took some heat, especially with HUD,'' Ms. Phillips said,noting that internal reports outlined problems in that agency yearsbefore they attracted widespread attention. ``HUD sensitized us toIG reports.''   Lantos' government operations subcommittee held a hearing inAugust with further meetings scheduled, most likely early nextyear. Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., will hold a hearing this week inhis Select Committee on Aging.   ``When similar warnings were ignored about the savings and loanindustry and about HUD program administration, the cost to theAmerican taxpayer and to our economy became staggering,'' Lantossaid.</TEXT></DOC>
