Several events have made it desirabIe to propose changes in ourseverance pay regulations: (1) Privatization is a major initiative designedto reduce deficit spending and to restore the Federal Government to itsappropriate role in the marketplace. To promote this initiative and tofacilitate the transfer of Federal employees to private contractors, weare proposing a change in the severance pay regulations that would permita separated employee to receive severance pay when he or she separatesand accepts employment from the contractor assuming the Federal functionthat resulted in the employee's separation: (2) The Omnibus Budget ReconciliationAct of 1982 changed the conditions under which employees can receive discontinuedservice retirement annuity. To reestablish the parallel between discontinuedservice retirement and severance pay, we are proposing to apply like eligibilityrequirements (with one or two exceptions) to these two separate benefits.(3) Recent court decisions require a change related to employees involuntarilyseparated from temporary appointments that follow permanent appointments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before July 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Send or deliver written comments to Barry E.

Karicher, (202) 632-5056.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Severance pay provides financial assistanceto Federal employees who are involuntarily separated without eligibilityfor immediate retirement benefits. This pay is intended to be a form oftemporary financial insurance, not an extension of the Federal career orof the full financial rewards of that career. (In addition to receivingseverance pay, separated employees who had life insurance and health benefitscoverage before separation can continue these without charge for 31 daysafter their separation. After 31 days, employees have the option of convertingFederal coverage to private coverage. They may do this regardless of theirphysical condition at the time of conversion and without any waiting periodsor restrictions for pre-existing medical conditions.)Our proposed regulations would make the following major changes in theseverance pay provisions: (1) <T3>Privatization. </T3>In 1967 the severance pay regulations were revisedin a manner that prohibits the payment of severance pay to an employeewho is involuntarily separated due to contracting out of a Federal functionif the employee (1) accepts or declines a reasonable offer of employmentwith the contractor made no later than the date of separation, or (2) acceptsany job with the contractor within 90 days of separation. We have becomeincreasingly aware of situations in which qualified separated Federal employeesin receipt of severance pay are refusing contract employment until expirationof the 90-day restriction period in order that they may receive their severancepay. As a result, contractors who are required to offer contract positionsto qualified separated Federal employees often are not able to fully staffthe contract operation with qualified employees during the crucial conversionperiod. To alleviate this problem, and to make contracting out more attractiveto affected Federal employees, OPM is proposing to remove the contractemployment restriction appearing in andSection; 550.701(b)(6) of Title 5,Code of Federal Regulations, as well as two similar restrictions in paragraphs(b)(5) and (7) of that section, concerning public non-Federal and non-appropriatedfund employment. The removal of these restrictions should encourage Federalemployees to accept employment offered by private contractors by providingthem with an additional financial incentive. This, in turn, should facilitatethe smooth transfer of operations to the private sector. To assist in developing statistical information on the proposed changein contract procedures, we are also proposing a new section of the regulationsthat would require agencies to keep records of the number of separatedemployees who receive severance pay each fiscal year, the amount paid,and the total number of separated employees who go to work for the contractorsthat assume their Federal functions (andSection; 550.713). (2) <T3>Eligibility for severance pay. </T3>Prior to 1982, eligibility requirementswere the same for severance pay and for discontinued service retirement(DSR) in that employees were eligible unless they declined an offer ofFederal employment at the same grade or pay level. However, under Pub.L. 97-253, the eligibility requirements for DSR were changed. Now, employeeswho are otherwise eligible for DSR cannot receive an annuity if they declinea ``reasonable offer of another position.'' A reasonable offer for DSRis an offer of a position: (a) In the employee's agency (including an agency to which the employeeand the function are transferred in a transfer of functions); (b) In the employee's commuting area; (c) Of the same tenure; and (d) Not more than the equivalent of two grades or pay levels below theemployee's current grade or pay level, regardless of whether the employeeis eligible for grade or pay retention under 5 CFR Part 536 or some otherauthority. At present, employees can receive severance pay if they have not declinedan offer of an ``equivalent position'' with the Federal Government. ``Equivalentposition'' is currently defined in 5 CFR 550.701(b)(2) as ``* * * a positionof like seniority, tenure, and pay <T3>other than a retained rate.'' </T3>Therefore, as a result of the changein law, an offer of a position two grades lower with grade or pay retentionmay be a ``reasonable offer'' for DSR purposes, but not an ``equivalentposition'' for severance pay purposes. To reestablish parallel eligibilitycriteria, we propose to replace the term ``equivalent position'' with ``reasonableoffer.'' ``Reasonable offer'' would have the same meaning for severancepay purposes as it has for discontinued service retirement purposes (andSection;550.703). (3) <T3>Severance pay after temporary employment. </T3>Under section 5595(a)(2)(ii)of title 5, United States Code, an employee separated from a temporaryappointment can receive severance pay only if the temporary appointmentfollows a permanent appointment with no more than a 3-day break in service.The current regulations allow temporary employees to receive severancepay only if they are involuntarily separated from a temporary appointmentmade no more than 3 days after <T3>involuntary </T3>separation from a permanent appointment. On December 9, 1983, the U.S. Claims Court, in the case of <T3>Sullivan </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>4 Cl.Ct. 70, ruled that the regulations contradictthe law. The court noted specifically that separation from the permanentappointment does not have to be involuntary for the temporary employeeto be eligible for severance pay if involuntarily separated from the subsequenttemporary appointment. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit(742 F.2d 628) affirmed the Claims Court ruling on September 6, 1984. The proposed definition of ``qualifying appointment'' (andSection; 550.703)would make the regulations match the law. (4) <T3>Exclusion of Schedule C and equivalent appointments. </T3>The proposedregulations clarify that the exclusion of Schedule C appointees from severancepay also applies to individuals appointed under equivalent appointmentsof a confidential or policy determining character, where the incumbentserves at the will of a Federal official. (For example, executive directorsof Presidential Advisory Councils, who serve at the will of the chairperson.)In addition to proposing the major revisions summarized above, we havemade several editorial revisions to clarify severance pay entitlements.For example, we have defined ``immediate annuity,'' ``inefficiency,'' ``nonqualifyingappointment,'' ``qualifying appointment,'' and ``representative rate,''and we have changed the order of existing provisions. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation </ITAG>I have determined that this is not a major rule as defined under section1(b) of E.O. 12291, Federal Regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>I certify that this regulation will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities, since it applies only to separatedFederal employees. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 550 </ITAG>Government employees and Wages.<ITAG tagnum="21">U.S. Office of Personnel Management.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Constance Horner,  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Diretor. </ITAG>Accordingly, OPM is proposing to revise Subpart G of Part 550 of Title5, Code of Federal Regulations, to read as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 550_PAY ADMINISTRATION (GENERAL) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.701 Introduction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.702 Coverage. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.703 Definitions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.704 Eligibility for severance pay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.705 Criteria for meeting the requirement for 12 months continuousemployment. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.706 Criteria for meeting the requirement for involuntary separation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.707 Computation of severance pay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.708 Creditable service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.709 Payment of severance pay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.710 Suspension of severance pay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.711 Termination of severance pay entitlement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.712 Reemployment; recredit of service. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">550.713 Records.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 5595; E.O. 11257. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="72">Subpart G_Severance Pay </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 550.701</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> lntroduction. </ITAG>This subpart contains regulations of the Office of Personnel Managementto implement the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 5595.These regulations authorizeseverance pay for employees who are involuntarily separated from Federalservice and who meet other conditions of eligibility. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 550.702</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Coverage. </ITAG>Except as provided in 5 U.S.C. 5595(a)(2)(i) through (viii), this subpartapplies to each full-time or part-time employee; that is, an employee witha regularly scheduled tour of duty, who is serving under a qualifying appointment,as defined in andSection; 550.703. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 550.703</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89"> Definitions. </ITAG>In this subpart: ``Agency'' means an agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 5595(a)(1), except thegovernment of the District of Columbia. ``Commuting area'' means the geographic area that normally is consideredone area for employment purposes.
