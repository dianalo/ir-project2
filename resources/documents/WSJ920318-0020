Saddam Hussein in neighboring Iraq is still capturing theheadlines, but senior Bush administration aides worry thatIran is the country that is slowly but steadily re-emergingas the premier power in the Persian Gulf -- and as a renewedthreat to American interests there.</RE><TEXT>   Iran has embarked on a broad rearming effort in which itappears to be acquiring advanced jets, tanks, missiles and,most curiously, used submarines, U.S. analysts say. Aboveall, Iran is buying gear from Russia and former Sovietsatellites to revive its air force and arm a more heavilyequipped army than it had during its war with Iraq.   Iran also seems to be embarked on its own nuclear-weaponsprogram, U.S. intelligence reports say. Iran denies this, butsome Iranian politicians openly champion the acquisition ofan &quot;Islamic&quot; nuclear bomb. At the same time, Iran is sheddingits image as patron only of radical Shiite Muslims by workingclosely with Sunni Muslims in North Africa, in thePalestinian movement and in former Soviet republics.   &quot;Their influence and standing are much higher,&quot; saysformer national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, whostays in touch with world leaders. &quot;They must be laughingwhen we rage about Iraq when they're doing everything Iraq isdoing and more.&quot;   In part, Iran is re-emerging simply because it is a big,ambitious and historically potent nation. But to an uncannydegree, Iran also has benefited from virtually all thecataclysmic events that have rocked the world in the last twoyears.   Operation Desert Storm crippled its biggest enemy, Iraq.This made it plausible for Iran to seek military superiorityover Baghdad, something that was far from its reach in 1988,when the exhausting eight-year Iran-Iraq war ended. Then,just as Iran embarked on rearmament, the collapse of theSoviet Union and the Warsaw Pact opened up a vast new armsbazaar in which cash-starved Soviet-bloc nations are eager tosell weapons cheaply.   At the same time, the Soviet breakup has fundamentallychanged Iran's corner of the world. It has given Tehran &quot;abigger playpen to operate in&quot; by handing autonomy to sixMuslim-dominated former Soviet republics to Iran's north,says former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger.   Iran has jumped in and is trying to expand its influencein ways big and small. In the last few weeks, for instance,it has tried to mediate Azerbaijan's dispute with neighboringArmenia, opened phone links to Turkmenistan and expressedreadiness to help develop oil reserves in the area.   In its quest for expanded influence, Iran still will beslowed by one significant obstacle: lingering economicproblems serious enough to provoke occasional demonstrationsand student strikes at home. Sagging world oil prices arestraining an Iranian budget already stretched by big billsfor government subsidies. Inflation, a chronic problem, isestimated to have run above 20% most of last year.   Iran's industrial structure, including its vital oilindustry, needs modernization, yet Tehran's revolutionarygovernment hasn't attracted much Western investment. Andwhile Iran's sheer size gives it some strategic advantages --with 58 million people, it is bigger than the seven Arab gulfstates combined -- its high population growth rate of 3.3%also strains its resources.   &quot;Eight years of war with Iraq took a hell of a lot out ofthem, not just out of the military structure but out of thewhole social structure of the country,&quot; says Richard Helms, aformer CIA director and former ambassador to Tehran.   Moreover, Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani's abilityto maneuver remains hampered by political splits between hisbackers and more radical Muslim clerics in Iran's Majlis, orparliament. He hopes to use parliamentary elections in Aprilto cut that radical bloc to a manageable minority.   Despite those strains, Iran's enhanced long-term prospectsclearly are making U.S. officials and allies nervous.   In the short term, Iran's goal probably is to simply buildup enough strength to ensure that it won't again bevulnerable to Iraqi attack. But in the long run, it seems tohave broader goals. Iran apparently wants to exercise thekind of influence over regional politics and world oil policythat its leaders have always thought their big andstrategically important country should have. And its leadersopenly declare that they want to shepherd Islam's risingpower in the post-Cold War world.   Iranian leaders across the political spectrum &quot;still seeIran as being the rightful dominant power in the region, andbeing the Islamic leader in the world,&quot; says James Placke, aformer State Department aide who's now an energy consultant.   In theory, an Iranian resurgence needn't be automaticallytroubling to Washington. In decades past, Iran and the U.S.have had similar interests, including a mutual suspicion ofRussia. Today, a strong Iran is the best counter to thestill-dangerous Saddam Hussein. The 1989 death of AyatollahKhomeini and Iran's efforts to free American hostages inLebanon raised hopes of a reconciliation.   A report by a group of Mideast experts assembled by theCenter for Strategic and International Studies argues that&quot;because of Iran's pivotal importance for stability in thePersian Gulf region . . . the United States should beprepared to move toward improved relations with Iran,provided Iran demonstrates readiness to play a constructiverole in the region.&quot;   In fact, even though Iran remains the country Americanslove to hate, three straight U.S. administrations havequietly lusted to rebuild ties to such a big andstrategically important land. That was never more clear thanthe time two years ago when a heavily accented caller fromabroad phoned the White House, identified himself as Mr.Rafsanjani and said he wanted to talk to President Bush aboutrebuilding ties. The caller left a number, and Mr. Bush wasintrigued enough to call back and carry out a conversationbefore determining the call was a hoax.   But Washington and Tehran still appear irreconcilablydivided over a fundamental issue. In the wake of DesertStorm, the U.S. wants expanded military ties to its Arabfriends in the region to better protect them and their oilsupplies. Iran is adamantly opposed. &quot;We will never allow anyother power, whether from this area or from outside,especially America, to become the gendarme of this oil-richand prosperous region of the world,&quot; declared Ayatollah AliHusseini Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, in a recentspeech to the Iranian air force.   Iran's arms buildup suggests it wants to take care of someof the regional police work itself. U.S. officials who havetracked Iran's moves say the rearmament appears to have takenroot in 1989, when President Rafsanjani consolidated power ina new constitution and Iran and the former Soviet Unionsigned a multibillion-dollar cooperation deal that includedarms sales.   That opening to Moscow, combined with Iran's pessimismabout ever being allowed open access to Western arms markets,appears to have led to a basic decision to rebuild withSoviet-designed gear. U.S. analysts believe that in 1990 Iranlaunched a five-year, $10 billion program to buy suchequipment from a variety of sources, including China, NorthKorea and the former Soviet republics.   &quot;It's almost entirely natural,&quot; says Shaul Bakhash, anIranian expatriate scholar at George Mason University. &quot;Iranlost a great deal of arms in the Iran-Iraq war and for eightyears or more had a great deal of difficulty buying.&quot; TheBush administration has tried to pressure Russia to stop orat least slow arms sales to Iran. But senior administrationaides say that, while Russia may curb sales somewhat, it isso strapped for cash that it isn't likely to stop them.   Iran's initial focus has been on reviving its air force,once stocked with American jets that were lost or worn out inits war with Iraq. U.S. officials say Iran has bought fromMoscow about 20 MiG-29s -- advanced fighters comparable toU.S. F-18 Hornets -- and agreed to buy more MiGs to expandits fleet to about 50 planes. Iran also has boughtless-advanced F-7 fighters from China; some U.S. analyststhink it has several dozen. And Iran has been buying Su-24fighter-bombers from Russia, of which it may now have about adozen.   Iran will also probably keep the more than 100 planes thatIraqi pilots flew there to avoid destruction during DesertStorm. Many are of limited use to Iran; it doesn't have thetraining or spare parts for the French-built Iraqi Miragefighters, for instance, and may simply sell or trade them.But the Iraqi fleet-in-exile does include some MiG-29s, asquadron of Su-24s and about 35 Su-22s, an olderfighter-bomber. Iran probably can use all those itself.   Meanwhile, U.S. officials say, Iran is shoppingintensively with Russia and Eastern Europe to buy hundreds ofT-72 tanks. Some U.S. analysts think Iran already has closedone deal in Eastern Europe.   Iran continues to buy Scud missiles from North Korea, U.S.analysts say, and appears to be shopping for technology toextend the range of its rockets. And according to oneintelligence report, China recently shipped Iran somesensitive gyroscopes used in rocket guidance systems. RobertGates, the director of central intelligence, warned incongressional testimony that Iran is likely to try to usecontacts in the former Soviet republic of Kazakhstan to &quot;tapinto Soviet weapons technology.&quot;   Perhaps the oddest intelligence U.S. officials have seenare reports that Tehran has ordered two or three smalldiesel-powered submarines from the former Soviet navy. U.S.officials see signs the subs will be based at Chah Bahar, aport outside the Persian Gulf, and surmise that Iran aims toextend its influence beyond the Gulf and out into the ArabianSea.   Most ominously, U.S. analysts see a series of signs Iranhas an expanded interest in building nuclear arms. Iran,which had to virtually shut down the shah's once-ambitiousnuclear program after the 1979 Islamic revolution, still isbelieved to be years from acquiring a nuclear capability. Butit now is in the midst of a big program of nuclearcooperation with China in which the two exchange nuclearscientists, officials say. Argentina recently decided tocancel a nuclear-cooperation deal with Iran, but othertransactions on the world market continue.   Iran insists all its nuclear activities are for peacefulpurposes. But some of its officials publicly declare theIslamic world should work together to acquire nuclear weaponsas long as Israel has a nuclear arsenal. Ataollah Mohajerani,a deputy president, said in a recent interview, &quot;The Islamiccountries should collectively utilize their resources toachieve nuclear strength.&quot;   Politically, Iran's leaders clearly want to projectIranian influence -- and are doing so in a more sophisticatedway. Tehran no longer openly threatens to subvert themonarchies of the Persian Gulf. But it is steadily buildinginfluence in Sudan, a poor north African country that bordersEgypt and lies just across the Red Sea from Saudi Arabia.Sudan is run by Islamic fundamentalists, and Iran has set upcultural centers, dispatched representatives to work inmosques and sent advisers from its Revolutionary Guards tohelp the Sudanese build paramilitary security units, U.S.officials say.   Iran also has long nurtured ties to the Islamicfundamentalists who were on the verge of seizing power inAlgeria before a government crackdown there, officials say.And Iran has fostered ties to Hamas, a relatively neworganization of Palestinian Islamic fundamentalists formed tofight Israel. But perhaps nothing Iran has done in recentmonths has so irked U.S. officials as its decision to be hostto a meeting last fall of &quot;rejectionists.&quot; It broughttogether Mideast radicals and terrorist leaders of everystripe opposed to the American-led peace process.   Those kinds of moves suggest that Iran thinks itspolitical and moral influence may be as potent as any weaponsit can buy. Mr. Rafsanjani suggested as much in a recentspeech. Iran, he said, is &quot;the base of the new movement ofthe world of Islam. . . . The eyes of Muslims world-wide arefocused here.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
