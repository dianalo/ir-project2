The response contains bothnarrative and tabular material. It covers an eight-year period consistingof the base year (FY1987), the current year (FY1988), the budget year(FY1989), the plan year (FY1990), and the out years (FY1991-1994). ThisSite Response was compiled by Argonne National Laboratory's ComputingServices organization, which has the responsibility to provide leadershipin optimizing computing and information services and disseminating computer-relatedtechnologies throughout the Laboratory. The Site Response consists offour parts. Part 1: ``Site Overview'' describes the ANL Mission, overallorganization structure, the strategic approach toward meeting informationtechnology resource needs, the planning process, major issues, and pointsof contact. Part 2A: ``Information Systems Plans for DOE Contractors''defines the current and planned automated information systems associatedwith the management of ANL, the stewardship of its resources, and theprovision of day-to-day general operations and services. (Part 2B: ``InformationSystems Plans for DOE Organizations'' and Part 2C: ``FMS Plans for DOEOrganizations'' do not apply to Argonne National Laboratory.) Part 3:``Computing Resources Plan'' defines the requirements, resources, acquisitions,and budget for computing at ANL for FY1987 through FY1994. Part 4: ``TelecommunicationsPlan'' documents the existing and planned telecommunications resourcesrequired at ANL from FY1987 through FY1994.</TEXT></DOC>
