The weed, a vine with triangular leaves and an iridescentblue berry, is a kind of horizontal version of Jack'sbeanstalk. It can grow as rapidly as six inches a day and cangrow from seed to 25 feet in a single season. It overruns andsmothers other vegetation and thus poses a threat toorchards, Christmas tree farms, shrub nurseries andreforestation efforts. It also can overrun the sides ofhighways.   The weed was first seen by weed scientist Nathan L.Hartwig of Pennsylvania State University in 1972, when aspecimen was brought to him from a shrub nursery south ofHarrisburg, Pa. He believes the weed came originally fromJapan, possibly aboard some rhododendrons imported by aPennsylvania nurseryman around 1930.   In a survey two years ago, Prof. Hartwig found thatmile-a-minute weed had spread to 12 Pennsylvania counties, 13Maryland counties and two sites in West Virginia. He believesthe pesty vine, spread by birds and rodents who eat the berryand by people moving yard plants to new homes, has reachedVirginia, Delaware and Washington.   Until now, the weed hasn't raised alarms because itdoesn't menace food and fiber crops where tilling andherbicides keep it at bay. But no-tillage crop practices andcutbacks on herbicide use could encourage its spread, thescientist suggests. &quot;It's a definite possibility that thisweed could spread from coast to coast,&quot; he says.   The weed scientist is searching for a herbicide that wouldwipe out the weed. Unfortunately, the most effective weedkiller he's found, Roundup, is nonselective and kills thetrees that the vine grows on.   Mr. Hartwig asks that anyone spotting mile-a-minute weedcall 1-800-247-3662.                                                                                                          Graphite May Drive   Pistons of Future                                                                                                          AUTO-ENGINE pistons someday may be made of carbon insteadof aluminum alloys.   Engineers at Daimler-Benz in Stuttgart, Germany, recentlymade pistons of fiber-reinforced graphite and installed themin the engine of a Mercedes-Benz 190E. During 15,000 miles ofcity and highway driving, hydrocarbon emissions were 20%lower than with aluminum-alloy pistons, and carbon-monoxideemissions were down by 30%. Gasoline consumption improved 3%.   &quot;The largest improvement, however, was observed in oilconsumption,&quot; research engineer Jurgen L. Heuer reported tothe August meeting of the American Chemical Society. &quot;Thecarbon piston engine consumed only 44% of the lubricating oilthat a standard engine needs,&quot; he said.   Carbon pistons suffer less friction than metal ones andare lighter, cutting piston weight by 20%, he explained. Theyalso stand up to high temperatures better and are quieter.   Unfortunately, carbon pistons also are more brittle thanaluminum pistons, and current manufacturing methods make themfar too expensive for use in today's engines. Mr. Heuer,however, suggested there might be cheaper ways to make thepistons.                                                                                                          New Form of Yogurt   Helps Stop Diarrhea                                                                                                          TWO TUFTS University medical school scientists and aFinnish dairy have developed a form of yogurt that helps stopdiarrhea.   Several years ago, Sherwood Gorbach and his colleague,Barry Goldin, of the community health department at Tufts inBoston, began searching for a naturally occurring bacteriumto make a yogurt that would live up to the sometimesexaggerated health claims of yogurt lovers. Five years ago,they isolated such a bug from the gut of a fellow professorand dubbed it lactobacillus GG, for Gorbach and Goldin.   The bacillus not only ferments milk into yogurt but hasthe ability to thrive in the intestine for several days andprevent the growth of other bacteria. The Americans tied upwith the big Finnish dairy cooperative, Valio, to test thenew yogurt's effect on diarrhea. They recently reported thatamong Finnish infants hospitalized for diarrhea, the problemcleared up in about two days in infants fed the new yogurt,compared with three days for other infants.   The &quot;yogurt-like&quot; product made with lactobacillus GGtechnically can't be called yogurt, because by internationalagreement, yogurt can be made only by a combination of twoother bacilli. Valio sells a low-fat version of the productin Finland under the name Gefilus.   Several U.S. dairies expressed interest in the Tufts bugafter it was described at a recent meeting of the Instituteof Food Technologists, Dr. Gorbach says. Data to back up theclaim that the product is effective are being submitted tothe U.S. Food and Drug Administration, he adds.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          DEVELOPING a pure white chrysanthemum for florist shops isthe goal of Florigene, a venture of DNA Plant Technology, aCinnaminson, N.J., biotech company. . . .
