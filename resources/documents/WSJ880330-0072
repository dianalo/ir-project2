While the bureau agreed to trim a few questions from its 1990 forms, it will be allowed to ask every household a few more questions than the budget office wanted, and can send more-detailed questionnaires to a larger number of households.    The agreement between the Census Bureau and the Office of Management and Budget, reached after months of negotiations, ends a controversy that began last July, when the OMB proposed that the bureau drop about 30 of the 61 questions the bureau planned to use in this month's &quot;dress rehearsal&quot; for the 1990 census.    Many of the questions concerned housing quality, the cost of utilities and employment history, which the OMB challenged as being available from other sources or not needed. The proposal set off an outcry from planners, local officials and members of Congress, among other users of census information.    The OMB, which says it is required to evaluate all government forms, previously had backed away from much of the earlier proposal. The agreement announced yesterday means that the 1990 census forms will closely follow the format originally proposed by the Census Bureau last year.    For example, certain questions that the OMB ordered cut will be restored, including the value of a home or the rent paid, and the total number of rooms per home. Additional questions, such as the presence of plumbing facilities and the cost of utilities and fuels, will also be kept, but only on a more detailed &quot;long form&quot; to be sent to a portion of the nation's households.    As in previous years, the Census Bureau planned to send a &quot;short form&quot; to each of the nation's estimated 106 million households, and the long form to about 16.6 million households. Under the new agreement, the Census Bureau will be allowed to send the long form to about 17.7 million households.    Certain questions that were asked in 1980 will be deleted in 1990, including employment five years ago, marital history, number of bathrooms and presence of air conditioning.    Although the agreement wasn't reached in time to test the questions in the Census Bureau's so-called dress rehearsal, held in three locations March 20, a census official said he didn't expect problems. &quot;We have tested these thoroughly since 1984 so we know these questions work,&quot; said Marshall Turner, chief of the 1990 census redistricting data office.    The agreement was also reached just before the April 1 deadline for reporting proposed census questions to Congress. </TEXT></DOC>
