Groundbreaking on the project had been scheduled forfall, but Williams said it is not likely to begin until spring because themoney is tied up.;    The Army's Corps of Engineers has promised a floodcontrol project on the Guadalupe for 46 years, but it was not until about sixyears ago that the agency approved initial planning and funding for the work.The Corps is to pay half the cost.;    The work is supposed to protectdowntown, the airport, roads and freeways from raging waters that could domore than $500 million damage in a so-called 100-year flood.;    (A 100-yearflood is a flood that has a 1 percent chance of occurring in any given year.);   &quot;There is some question about whether some features are properly done atfederal expense or at local expense -- aesthetic features that are notnormally associated with flood control,&quot; said Morgan Rees, deputy forplanning, policy and legislation in the Pentagon office of the AssistantSecretary of the Army for Civil Works.;    In other words, the city and waterdistrict plans for a park that includes meadows and hiking trails, picnicareas, ponds and landscaping and sculptured riverbanks, simply looks toofancy.;    &quot;It's taken us years to come up with something that would controlthe so-called 100-year flood and be compatible with the environment,&quot; Lewissaid. &quot;We were just absolutely blown away when they took this money away. Damnit, we've played by all the rules.&quot;;    The drawings and cost-sharingarrangement were developed with the help and approval of the Corps' Sacramentoand San Francisco staffs, said Lewis and Williams.;    But final approval wasneeded from G. Edward Dickey, acting principal deputy Assistant Secretary ofthe Army for Civil Works.;    &quot;Dr. Dickey pulled the rug out from under us,&quot;said Williams.;    Williams said the Guadalupe plan is one of the first urbanflood control plans to follow a 1986 law designed to push the Corps away fromencasing river channels in concrete. Original drawings for the Guadalupeshowed just such a plan.;    City officials, busy building a new downtown thatties into the river with the Children's Discovery Museum, Technology Centerand arena, wanted more and those original drawings were discarded years ago.At the same time, land value, which is figured into the local agencies' shareof the cost, went up. That, coupled with more intricate designs, boosted thecost projections to about $134 million.;    Corps official Rees acknowledgedthat &quot;the notion of aesthetically pleasing federal projects does not have abig history behind it,&quot; said it's not beauty, but money that is in question.;   &quot;Costs are up 300 percent . . . and we haven't got a breakdown of where thatmoney is being spent,&quot; he said.;    But Williams and Lewis insisted that theinformation has been provided. The two were part of a group that flew toWashington last month to provide even more details.;    Now they're hopingthat intervention from San Jose Reps. Norm Mineta and Don Edwards will help.;   In a letter sent to Dickey late Wednesday, Mineta and Edwards said they were&quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by the suspension.;    Rees said Dickey will decide whetherto restore funding by next month. &quot;We agree (the project) has been around toolong,&quot; he said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MALINE HAZLE, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910509  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  690  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday May 9, 199100130128,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
