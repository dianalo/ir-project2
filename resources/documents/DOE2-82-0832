An important He/sup +/ ion signal is detected for two typesof target: (1) polar molecules (NH3, SO2, C3H60) where MJ + He(n/sup1/p) yields M(J') + He + e/sup -/; and (2) molecules with great electronicaffinity (SF6, NO2) where M + He(n/sup 1/P) yields M/sup -/ + He/sup+/. For each of these processes, the variation of the collision as afunction of kinetic energy, and the absolute value of the ionizationcross section in the thermal domain (200 to 500 MeV) are measured. Theresults cannot be interpreted with the free electron model, which reducesthe interactions in the process studied to only the Rydberg electron-moleculeinteraction, which is treated by bipolar Born approximation. This modelpredicts: no ionization of Rydberg atoms near n=14 for system (1), whereaslarge cross sections, attributed to molecular relaxation transitionsof several quanta of rotational energy are measured; and a v/sup -1//subr/ velocity dependence of the cross section, whereas different behavioris observed experimentally (for (1) a v/sup -2//sub r/ monotone decrease,for (2) a curve showing a maximum).</TEXT></DOC>
