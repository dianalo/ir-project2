Gen. Prosper Avril's military government promised not to punishthem.   Radio Soleil, the Roman Catholic church radio station, said morethan 230 of the Dessalines Barracks' 750 soldiers had reported toarmy headquarters by Tuesday morning.   Foreign Minister Serge Elie Charles said Monday no rebels werebeing held prisoner. The government has said they will be treated``with dignity'' and no reprisals will be taken.   Two gunmen identified as Dessalines deserters hijacked atwin-engine airplane Monday that was carrying missionaries based inRedlands, Calif., from Haiti to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.   The hijackers diverted the plane to Miami and surrendered. Theseven other passsengers and the pilot were not harmed.   Avril's 1,100-man Presidential Guard based at the NationalPalace stormed the adjoining Dessalines barracks Saturday to putdown a rebellion among soldiers demanding that the general give upthe presidency.   Fighting began Friday night and lasted 20 hours. Avril toldreporters Monday most of the cartridges used initially were blanks,in order to reduce casualties.   He said the Saturday assault with live ammunition occurred aftermortar shells from the Dessalines Barracks landed near the palace,killing three soldiers.   Five soldiers were killed in the two days of fighting, and asixth died Sunday while trying to recover an unexploded grenade,Avril said. He also reported one civilian killed and 43 soldiersand 32 civilians wounded.   It remained unclear whether Avril would disband the Dessalines,widely regarded as the most repressive unit in Haiti's 7,000-manarmy.   Col. Guy Francois, its former commander, was said to have beengiven temporary asylum in the Vatica Embassy. The government hasidentified Francois as one of four leaders of a coup attempt April2.   Negotiations continued between the government and the 414-memberLeopards Battalion, the other unit that rebelled last week. Lt.Col. Himmler Rebu, the commander, was deported after being named asa conspirator in the coup attempt.   Avril said 12 Leopards had not returned to their base, but thebattalion had accepted government authority.   ``Everything is on the way to the re-establishment of order,''Adjutant Gen. Andrei Jean-Pierre said Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
