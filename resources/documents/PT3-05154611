The length of      the portion of the wire which protrudes from the stop(s) constitutes the      working length for the root canal treatment. The working length is      maintained the same during the treatment, since the stopping means is      sandwiched by two stiff objects, namely, the tooth being treated and the      rigid object. Also disclosed are (1) a set of movable stops of specific      thicknesses for precisely setting a range of working lengths, and (2) a      container for storing the set. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This invention relates generally to endodontic instruments used in root      canal treatment, and particularly to those used for the penetration,      boring, drilling, widening and remodeling of root canals before obturation      thereof. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  In many endodontic operations, it is necessary to successively insert an      elongated instrument into, and then pull the same from, the root canal of      a tooth in order to thoroughly remove any inflamed or necrotic tissue      therein and properly enlarge the canal. The instrumented root canal is      subsequently sealed off with aseptic material. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 1, the conventional endodontic instrument 10, which is      used in the root canal treatment described above, generally consists of a      thin, flexible wire 12, with an abrasive surface acting as a file, a      reamer, or the like, a handle 16 and a rubber stop 14. The handle 16,      which is adapted for gripping by the operator, is securely affixed at one      end of the wire 12. The rubber stop 14, on the other hand, is movably      attached to the wire 12 and can be easily relocated therealong. </PAR><PAR>  The position of the stop 1 at the wire 12 determines the working length 18      of the instrument 10, i.e., the length of the wire 12 to be embedded in      the tooth during the treatment, since the stop 14 prevents further      penetration of the wire 12 into the canal in the tooth when its bottom      surface bumps onto the incisal edge or cusp tip of the tooth being      treated. </PAR><PAR>  There are several drawbacks associated with the conventional instrument.      For example, the stop 14 may slip without being noticed by the operator      during the treatment, thereby causing over-instrumentation or      under-instrumentation of the canal. </PAR><PAR>  Also, while the working length 18 is usually determined by radiography,      adjustment of the position of the stop 14 by relocating it along the wire      12 is usually required. Thus, the stop 14 may be incorrectly positioned by      the operator because of his or her biases or inexperience. </PAR><PAR>  Similarly, when preparing a series of endodontic instruments of various      diameters to be used in treating the same canal, there may be      discrepancies of the working lengths among the instruments because of the      operator's biases or inexperience. This greatly increases the possibility      of incomplete instrumentation or even perforation of the canal. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Accordingly, it is a general object of the present invention to provide an      endodontic instrument whose working length, once set, remains the same      throughout the root canal treatment. </PAR><PAR>  It is another object of the present invention to provide an endodontic      instrument adjustment of whose working lengths minimizes biases or      inexperience of the operator. </PAR><PAR>  It is still another object of the present invention to provide an      endodontic instrument whose working length can be easily set so that it is      identical to that of another instrument without resorting to the      subjective judgment of the operator. </PAR><PAR>  Other objects will, in part, be obvious and will, in part, appear below. </PAR><PAR>  The invention accordingly comprises the features of construction,      combination of elements and arrangement of parts which will be exemplified      in the following detailed description, and the scope of the invention will      be indicated in the claims. </PAR><PAR>  Briefly and generally, one embodiment of the present invention is an      endodontic instrument comprising three parts: an elongated wire, a rigid      object securely affixed at a predetermined point on the wire, and a      stopping means which extends along a portion of the wire and abuts on the      rigid object. The length of the portion of the wire which protrudes from      the stopping means constitutes the working length. In other words, the      working length equals the difference between the length of the stopping      means and the length of the wire beyond the rigid object. The working      length for this instrument is maintained the same during the root canal      treatment, since the stopping means is sandwiched by two stiff objects,      namely, the tooth being treated and the rigid object. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a set of stop units      of different thicknesses. The stop units in the set are dimensioned so      that specific combinations of the thicknesses of the units result in a      number of desired lengths for stopping means. Further, the stop units can      be movably attached to the wire. Therefore, attachment of the stop unit(s)      in different combinations to the wire constitutes a stop means of a      desired length, and thus enables one to attain a specific working length      for the instrument. </PAR><PAR>  Still another embodiment of the present invention comprises a container for      storing the above-described stop units. In this container, disposed      between its top and bottom faces is at least one panel on which,      preferably, at least one hole is formed. With such construction, a stop      unit properly seated on the hole can be easily picked up by penetrating      the wire of an instrument through it and the hole. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  The above and further advantages of the invention may be better understood      by referring to the following description in conjunction with the      accompanying drawings, in which: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a conventional endodontic instrument; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an endodontic instrument in accordance with      one embodiment of the present instrument; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is an exploded view of the FIG. 2 invention; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a container in accordance with another      embodiment of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAR>  In all the drawings, identical numerals represent respectively identical      elements. Various elements shown in the drawing are not necessarily in      proportion to their actual sizes. Further, as used herein, the terms such      as &quot;upward&quot;, &quot;downward&quot;, &quot;underside&quot;, &quot;upper surface&quot; and the like are      intended only to denote relative direction solely with reference to the      illustrations in the accompanying drawings. </PAR><PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  An endodontic instrument embodying the present invention is generally      designated by numeral 20 as shown in FIG. 2. The instrument 20 comprises      an elongated wire 22, stopping means 24, and a handle 26. The stopping      means 24 further comprises three rubber stop units 24a, 24b and 24c. </PAR><PAR>  As more clearly shown in FIG. 3, the handle 26, which is made of rigid      material, is securely attached to the wire 22 by any proper means. The      rubber stop units 24a, 24b and 24c, on the other hand, are resilient discs      with relatively flat upper and lower surfaces. The rubber stop units 24a,      24b and 24c are movably attached to the wire 22 by penetrating the wire 22      through the centers of their upper and lower surfaces. Once penetration by      the wire 22 of all three stop units 24a, 24b and 24c is complete, they are      pushed upward along the wire 22 until they abut on each other and also, as      a whole, abut on the handle 26. Note that the stop unit 24a, 24b or 24c      may be pre-perforated to form a centrally disposed passage 25a, 25b or 25c      extending through its entire thickness, if desired. Provision of such      passages 25a, 25b and 25c facilitates penetration by the wire 22 through      the stop units 24a, 24b and 24c. </PAR><PAR>  Referring back to FIG. 2, in an assembled instrument 20, the stop units      24a, 24b and 24c are held in place by frictionally gripping the wire 22.      The portion of the wire 22 that is not embedded in the rubber stop units      24a, 24b and 24c constitutes the working length 28 of the instrument 20. </PAR><PAR>  It is preferable that all the parts in the instrument shown in FIG. 2 be      autoclavable, so that they can be conveniently sterilized before use. It      is also preferable that the stop units 24a, 24b and 24c be made of      radio-opaque material. This will enable one to determine the precise      working length for a specific canal by irradiating the canal into which      the wire 22 of the FIG. 2 instrument 20 is inserted with X-ray using the      technique well known in the art. </PAR><PAR>  Since the upward movement of the rubber stop units 24a, 24b and 24c is      constrained by the handle 26 when the instrument 20 is being used to treat      a canal, the working length 28 will never become longer because of      accidental slip. Moreover, the working length 28 can always be maintained      at a predetermined value during the root canal treatment even though      unintended downward movement of the stop units 24a, 24b and 24c, which      shortens the protruding portion of the wire 22, may occur. This is      because, during the treatment, the underside of the lowest stop unit,      i.e., 24c in the FIG. 2 instrument, is routinely pushed against a      reference point on the surface of the tooth being treated to ensure a      thorough insertion into the canal. In other words, any accidental downward      movement of the stop units 24a, 24b and 24c is corrected upon each      insertion of the wire 22 into the canal, and the preset working length 28      is thus maintained throughout the endodontic operation. </PAR><PAR>  Note that one of the most important features of the FIG. 2 embodiment is      the lack of any space between the upper surface of the stop means 24      (i.e., the upper surface of the stop unit 24a) and the handle 26. This      feature prevents any upward movement of the stopping means 24. By      contrast, in the prior art instrument, which is shown in FIG. 1, there is      always a free wire that extends between the handle 16 and the stop 14. In      this light, while three stop units 24a, 24b and 24c of different      thicknesses are attached to the wire 22 in the FIG. 2 embodiment, an      instrument with only one stop unit, for example, that is attached to the      wire and pressed against the handle is also within the scope of the      invention. </PAR><PAR>  As shown in FIG. 2, the combined thickness of the stop units 24a, 24b and      24c constitutes the length of the stopping means 24, which in turn      determines the length of the free portion of the wire, or the working      length 28, of the instrument 20. Thus, the working length 28 of the      instrument 20 can be easily set by attaching a predetermined number of      stop units with predetermined thicknesses to the wire 22. </PAR><PAR>  Another embodiment of the present invention comprises a set of six stop      units with four different thicknesses, i.e., two 3 mm-thick units, two 2      mm-thick units, one 1 mm-thick unit and one 0.5 mm-thick unit. Table I      illustrates that by attaching one or more rubber stop units selected from      this six-unit set to a 21 mm-long wire in the manner described above, one      is able to set at least fourteen different working lengths ranging from 14      mm to 20.5 mm in steps of 0.5 mm. </PAR><PAR>  Note that at most three stop units have to be attached to the wire in      employing this embodiment to set different working lengths. Also, two      identical stop units, namely, those of 3 mm and 2 mm thicknesses, are used      in some combinations, e.g., see Table I, rows 1 and 6 under the heading      &quot;Combination&quot;. Thus, it is necessary to supply two stop units of these      thicknesses in this set. Preferably, each of the four thicknesses is      designated with a different color or shape so that the unit stop of a      specific thickness can be readily identified by the operator. It is also      preferable that the stop units be pre-perforated to facilitate penetration      by the wire. </PAR><TBL>                TABLE I                                                          ______________________________________                                         Combination.sup.1                                                                       Length of Stopping Means.sup.2                                                                    Working Length.sup.3                               ______________________________________                                         2A andplus; C   7.0 mm             14.0 mm                                            2A andplus; D   6.5 mm             14.5 mm                                            2A       6.0 mm             15.0 mm                                            A andplus; B andplus; D                                                                               5.5 mm             15.5 mm                                            A andplus; B    5.0 mm             16.0 mm                                            2B andplus; D   4.5 mm             16.5 mm                                            2B       4.0 mm             17.0 mm                                            B andplus; C andplus; D                                                                               3.5 mm             17.5 mm                                            B andplus; C    3.0 mm             18.0 mm                                            B andplus; D    2.5 mm             18.5 mm                                            B        2.0 mm             19.0 mm                                            C andplus; D    1.5 mm             19.5 mm                                            C        1.0 mm             20.0 mm                                            D        0.5 mm             20.5 mm                                            ______________________________________                                          .sup.1 A, B, C and D represent rubber stops with thicknesses of 3 mm, 2        mm, 1 mm and 0.5 mm, respectively                                              .sup.2 The length of stopping means is the sum of the thickness(es) of th      stop(s) attached to the wire which is 21 mm in length.                         .sup.3 The working length is the difference between the length of the          wire, i.e., 21 mm, and the length of the stopping means.                  </TBL><PAR>  The set of stop units described above is an illustrative, non-limiting      example which serves the sole purpose of demonstrating how one can      assemble, from an assortment of stop units, an endodontic instrument,      similar to that shown in FIG. 2, with a predetermined working length.      Thus, a person skilled in the art, based on this example, will be able to      provide various sets of stop units with thicknesses different from part or      all of those set forth above, so that attachment of the stop unit(s) from      each set to the wire of an endodontic instrument enables one to attain a      desired range of working lengths. In this context, it is to be noted that      the stops provided by the suppliers as a part of the prior art instrument,      as shown in FIG. 1, are of one uniform thickness and only one stop is      attached to the wire of the instrument at all times. </PAR><PAR>  As discussed above, one advantage of the endodontic instrument embodiment      of the present invention is that the working length, once set, is      maintained at the same value throughout the root canal treatment. The      instrument is also advantaged in that, with a set of stop units such as      those shown in Table I, an accurate working length can always be attained      by attaching to the wire a predetermined number of stop units, each of      which is of a specific thickness. Thus, precisely identical working      lengths can be set for a number of endodontic instruments. Note that a      series of endodontic instruments with wires of different diameters or      shapes, yet of identical working lengths, are usually required to treat      the same canal. </PAR><PAR>  In contrast, adjustment of the position of a rubber stop along the wire of      a conventional instrument (see FIG. 1) requires visual measurements of      lengths with the aid of a scale. Thus, the precision of the position      adjusted is in large part determined by the operator's vision. As a      result, reproduction of precisely identical working lengths for a series      of endodontic instruments is a rather difficult, if not impossible, task. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 depicts a container, designated at numeral 30, for storing six sets      of the stop units described in Table I and its accompanying text. The      container 30, which is rectangular in appearance, comprises one open top      face 32, one bottom wall 34 and four side walls 36, 38, 40 and 42.      Preferably, the container 30 is made of transparent or translucent      material so that its contents can be clearly seen from the outside without      removing its cover 35 to expose the top face 32. The cover 35 for the FIG.      4 container 30 is of flap type. However, a slide-type cover can also be      adopted, if desired. It is also preferable that the container 30 be made      of material which is resistant to relatively high temperatures and      pressures so that it can be conveniently sterilized in a conventional      autoclave. </PAR><PAR>  Four panels 44, 46, 48 and 50, which parallel the top face 32 and the      bottom wall 34, are provided in the container 30 to seat the stop units      52, 54, 56 and 58 of different thicknesses. In particular, the panel 44 is      about 3 mm away from the top face 32 so that an upright 3 mm-thick stop      unit 52 can rest thereon without protruding above the open face 32 of the      container 30. Similarly, the panels 46, 48 and 50 are so disposed as to be      able to receive in a like manner the 2 mm unit 54, 1 mm unit 56 and 0.5 mm      unit 58, respectively. Note that the stop units shown in FIG. 4 are      pre-perforated to facilitate their removal from the container 30 in a      manner to be described below. </PAR><PAR>  The lengths of panels 44, 46, 48 and 50 are coextensive with one dimension      of the container 30. Two sets of parallel panels 60 and 70 are further      provided to divide the container 30 into six rows 62 and six columns 72,      respectively. Each row 62 contains six compartments and is capable of      accommodating six stop units of the above-described set, namely, two 3 mm      and 2 mm units and one 1 mm and 0.5 mm unit, with one unit in one      compartment. Note that each compartment is so dimensioned as to snugly      accommodate one stop unit of a specific thickness. </PAR><PAR>  Since each of the rows 62 can accommodate one six-unit set, a total of six      identical sets can be stored in the container 30. It is preferable that a      container for storing stop units be capable of accommodating a plurality      of identical sets of stop units. As mentioned above, a series of      endodontic instruments of different diameters, which are set to attain an      identical working length, are usually required to treat one root canal.      Thus, it is convenient to provide such a container so that a series of      instruments with an identical working length can be prepared from the stop      units stored therein without resorting to stop units stored in another      container. </PAR><PAR>  Snug confinement of each stop unit in its compartment is preferred, since      it keeps the stop units in their upright position even when the container      30 is being moved from one place to another, e.g., from an autoclave to a      storage cabinet. Also, as will become more clearly below, such snug      confinement greatly facilitates retrieval of the stop units from the      container 30. </PAR><PAR>  The width of panels 44 and 46 is two times that of panels 48 and 50 so that      the former can accommodate two stop units 52 or 54 in a row 62 (only one      is shown) while the latter can accommodate only one unit 56 or 58. This      feature is necessitated, since the set of stop units to be stored in the      container 30 consists of two 3 mm units, two 2 mm units, one 1 mm unit and      one 0.5 mm unit. </PAR><PAR>  Preferably, a hole 64 is formed about the center of the bottom wall of each      compartment. Further, the height of the container 30 is preferably greater      than 5 mm, so that all the holes 64 are at least 2 mm away from the bottom      wall 34 of the container 30. </PAR><PAR>  To set a specific working length of an instrument, one first consults a      chart similar to Table I to determine which combination of stop units to      be used. Then, the wire of the instrument is directed to penetrate one of      the stop units in that combination while the stop unit to be penetrated      remains in the container 30 during the entire penetration process. Once      that stop unit has been penetrated through its entire thickness by the      wire, it is frictionally engaged with the wire and thus can be easily      picked up from the container 30. A second or third stop unit can be      retrieved by the same wire from the container 30 in a similar manner, if      necessary. </PAR><PAR>  Pre-perforation of stop units enables one to aim and penetrate the unit      without much difficulty. So does snug confinement of each stop unit in its      compartment, since the unit remains rather steady in its upright position      during the entire retrieval process as described above. Note that      coplanarity of the upper surfaces of the stop units with the top face of      the container, as shown in FIG. 4, also promotes accurate aiming, since      the stop units are presented as nearly to the eye of the operator as      possible while not protruding above the top face. </PAR><PAR>  The stop unit is so positioned in its compartment such that the wire, once      penetrating the passage, enters the hole 64 formed on panel 44, 46, 48 or      50. Provision of holes 64 and some space between the holes 64 and the      bottom wall 34 serves to prevent the wire from bumping into a hard surface      and becoming bent when the penetration is complete. Further, when the      container 30 is made of transparent or translucent material, one can also      avoid the just-mentioned bending problem by cautiously watching the      penetration of the wire. </PAR><PAR>  The foregoing description has been limited to specific embodiments of this      invention. It will be apparent, however, that variations and modifications      may be made to the invention, with the attainment of some or all of the      advantages of the invention. </PAR><PAR>  For example, while a handle is used as the upper limit against movement of      the stopping means in the instrument embodiment shown in FIG. 2, any rigid      object securely attached at one proper point on the wire can also perform      this function. </PAR><PAR>  Also, in the container embodiment shown in FIG. 4, three sets of panels      intersect to form a plurality of compartments, each of which snugly      receives a stop unit. Confinement of stop units to limit their movement      can also be achieved by forming recessive sockets on the horizontal panels      and seating the stop units in the sockets. </PAR><PAR>  Therefore, it is the object of the appended claims to cover all such      variations and modifications as come within the true spirit and scope of      the invention. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  What is claimed is: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
