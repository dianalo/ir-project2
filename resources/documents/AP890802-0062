The Pravda commentary by analyst Yuri Glukhov said Friday'skidnapping of Obeid by Israeli commandos was ``a criminal action(that) provoked the tragic course of events.''   A Shiite group said it hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. WilliamHiggins on Monday because Israel refused to release the cleric.   Kidnappers have threatened to kill another American hostage,Joseph Cicippio, on Thursday if Obeid is not freed.   Pravda focused on Israel's ``terrorist actions'' over the pastyears, including abductions and political assassinations, and saidthe Israeli occupation of the West Bank made the entire Palestinianpeople ``the hostage of an aggressive policy.''   The Soviet Foreign Ministry also blamed Israel for sparking thehostage crisis. In a hastily called briefing Tuesday, spokesmanVadim Perfiliev denounced the killing of Higgins as ``inhuman'' butaccused Israel of ``aggravation of the situation.''</TEXT></DOC>
