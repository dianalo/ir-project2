Norby Walters, 57, received five years in prison, and LloydBloom, 29, three years. U.S. District Judge George Marovich alsogave them five years' probation.   They were convicted April 13 of racketeering, conspiracy and mailfraud and had faced up to 55 years in prison.   ``There were no heroes,'' Marovich said of the case, subject of afive-week trial.   The judge said the athletes involved were equally guilty offraud, and he gave ``fair warning'' to athletes, sports agents,university administrators and others involved in college athletics:   ``You may be playing in a different ballgame and it might becalled hardball. ... There is a previously unrecognized player onthe field: the rule of law.''   The two agents were accused of paying athletes thousands ofdollars to sign secret representation contracts before their collegeeligibility had expired, a violation of NCAA rules; of threateningathletes to prevent them from breaking the agreements, and ofcheating seven major universities out of scholarship money throughthe NCAA violation, which made the athletes ineligible to play.   Forty-three players who signed with Walters and Bloom avoidedprosecution by agreeing to cooperate with the government in additionto performing community service and repaying part of theirscholarships to their schools.   Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver Chris Carter pleaded guilty inSeptember to mail fraud and obstruction of justice. He said he took$5,000 from Walters and Bloom in 1986 while a junior at Ohio StateUniversity.   In April he was fined $15,000 and ordered to perform 600 hours ofcommunity service.   ``I'm really sorry for all the problems I gave caused everyone,''Walters told the court, almost whispering and at times choking backtears. ``I invested almost a million dollars in this sportsbusiness. I lost it all _ I lost every penny.''   ``If I believed for one instant that I was breaking the law, Iwouldn't have started,'' Walter said, adding: ``I didn't threatenanybody.''   Bloom told the court: `I am deeply sorry for what I've done. If Ican be given a second chance I'd like it.   Attorneys for the agents have appealed the convictions.</TEXT></DOC>
