We want to be able to determine howthis surface changes (evolves) through time as demes go extinct, speciationoccurs, or parameters change. How the surface behaves when differentecological and genetic processes are occurring is mathematically formulated.We began by getting a qualitative picture of the topography of the surfacefor a particular ecological or genetic process. The surface changes whenadaptation or speciation is occurring so that the surface is continuouslyfluctuating and changing, sometimes in bizarre ways. Sometimes trajectorieson this complicated and folded surface change so rapidly they are difficultto detect. In order to theoretically and numerically analyze such a complicatedproblem we must at least be able to take snapshots of the dynamical changesof the surface. We have developed a vector field model of evolution whichinvolves modeling specific ecological and genetic processes as differentialequations on a surface that dynamically changes. We are using this formalismto theoretically classify the effects of ecological and genetic processeson the FWH surface.</TEXT></DOC>
