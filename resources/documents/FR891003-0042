Under andSection; 21.42(c) the basic 12-yearperiod of eligiblity does not run during any period of 30 days or moreduring which the veteran was unable to participate in a vocational rehabilitationprogram because of his or her medical condition. Section 21.42(c) is amendedto specifically include chronic alcoholism as a condition for which thebasic 12-year eligibility period for vocational rehabilitation may be adjusted.The proposed regulation also defines what VA considers as the disablingeffects of chronic alcoholism for the purpose of adjusting the basic 12-yearperiod of eligibility. This proposed regulation will have no effect onprovisions of the regulations relating to the compensation and pensionprogram.VA has determined that this proposed regulation does not contain a majorrule as that term is defined in Executive Order 12291, Federal Regulation.The proposal will not have a $100 million annual effect on the economy,will not cause a major increase in costs or prices, and will not have anyother significant adverse effects on the economy.It is proposed to make this amendment retroactively effective. This isan intepretative rule which implements statutory provisions. Moreover,VA finds good cause exists for making this rule, like the section of thelaw which it implements, retroactively effective to the date of enactment.A delayed effective date would be contrary to statutory design; would complicateimplementation of this provision of law; and might result in a denial ofa benefit to a veteran who is entitled by law to that benefit.The Secretary certifies that this proposed regulation will not, if promulgated,have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this proposed rule is therefore exempt fromthe initial and final flexibility analyses requirements of andSection;andSection;603 and 604. The reasons for this certification are that this proposedregulation only affects the rights of individual beneficiaries. No newregulatory burdens are imposed on small entities by this regulation.<ITAG tagnum="20">(The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance number is 64.116)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 38 CFR Part 21</ITAG>Civil rights, Claims, Education, Grant programs, Loan programs, Reportingrequirements, Schools, Veterans, Vocational education, Vocational rehabilitation.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: September 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.

The 12-year periodshall begin or resume when it is feasible for the veteran to participatein a vocational rehabilitation program, as that term is defined in andSection;21.35 of this part.(2) The term ``disabling effects of chronic alcoholism'' means alcohol-inducedphysical or mental disorders or both, such as habitual intoxication, withdrawal,delirium, amnesia, dementia, and other like manifestations of chronic alcoholismwhich, in the particular case:(i) Have been medically diagnosed as manifestations of alcohol dependencyor chronic alcohol abuse; and(ii) Are determined to have prevented commencement or completion of theaffected individual's rehabilitation program.(3) A diagnosis of alcoholism, chronic alcoholism, alcohol dependency,chronic alcohol abuse, etc., in and of itself, does not satisfy the definitionof ``chronic alcoholism.''(4) Injury sustained by a veteran as a proximate and immediate result ofactivity undertaken by the veteran while physically or mentally unqualifiedto do so due to alcoholic intoxication is not considered a disabling effectof chronic alcoholism.(5) The disabling effects of chronic alcoholism, which prevent initiationor continuation of participation in a vocational rehabilitation programafter November 17, 1988, shall not be considered to be the result of willfulmisconduct.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1503(b)(1), Pub.
