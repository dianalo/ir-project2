The three-page stipulation of evidence was unsealed Friday incensored form as a result of a lawsuit filed by 10 newsorganizations and settled by agreement with the Justice Department.   The document, which had been released to the jury, saidintelligence gathered in a 15-month period beginning in September1985 ``provides information regarding the pricing and delivery ofmissiles and military material sold to Iran and the release ofAmerican hostages held in Lebanon.''   North's lawyers used the document in their closing argument inan effort to show that then-CIA Director William Casey andthen-national security adviser John Poindexter knew that Hawkmissiles were aboard a November 1985 shipment sent from Israel toIran with assistance by the CIA.   North was found guilty of three felony charges Thursday,including the preparation of a false chronology for Congressstating that no one in the government knew until January 1986 thatmissiles were in the November 1985 shipment. North's defense on thecharge was that Casey and Poindexter knew at the time what wasaboard, but participated in covering up that fact.   The document spelled out that the 17 recipients of theintelligence reports ``exclusively'' were Poindexter and hispredecessor in the job, Robert McFarlane, North, Casey, DefenseSecretary Caspar Weinberger and other senior intelligence officials.   ``The reports contained information about pricing of thismaterial, and those recipients of the reports at the CIA, NationalSecurity Council and the Department of Defense who knew the actualcost of this material to the DoD could have known the Iranians werebeing significantly overcharged,'' the paper said.   ``The reports of very late November and early December 1985revealed that Hawk missiles were shipped to Iran from Israel inconnection with recovery efforts.''   Still-classified reports on the intelligence were gathered by``various methods of surveillance'' and ``show individualsinvolved, including General Secord,'' the document adds. Northenlisted Secord to run arms to the Contras and also had the formerAir Force major general-turned-businessman assist arms shipments toIran for the Reagan administration.   North and Secord diverted profits from the Iran arms sales intobank accounts controlled by Secord and some of the diverted moneywas funneled to the Contras. The diversion originally formed theheart of the criminal indictment against North, but the U.S.intelligence community refused to declassify key documentsaddressing those charges and they were dropped.</TEXT></DOC>
