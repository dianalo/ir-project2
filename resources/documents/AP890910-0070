A British newspaper said many of the passengers aboard wereWestern tourists.   The collision occurred upstream of the port city of Galati, about125 miles northeast of the Romanian capital of Bucharest, the reportsaid. The ship sank ``in conditions of poor visibility,'' it said.   A total of 169 passengers were aboard the Romanian ship. Only 18of them and the ship's 13 crew members had been rescued, Agerpressaid. It did not give the nationality of the passengers.   The Bulgarian state BTA news agency said the Romanian cruiserMogosoaia collided with the Bulgarian ship Peter Karaminchev, whichwas tugging a convoy of loaded barges.   ``After the alarm was sounded by the Bulgarian ship, its crew andthe crew of the ships in the proximity ran to help,'' BTA said.   It said there were no reports of casualties aboard the tug.   There was no report on what caused the boats to collide.   In London, an early edition of The Independent newspaper saidapart from the 13 crew, most of the 169 passengers aboard theMogosoaia ``were almost certainly Western tourists.'' The newspaperreport from Vienna quoted Danube shipping officials in the Austriancapital.   Pleasure cruises on the Danube are one of Romania's few sourcesof hard currency, it said.   Agerpres said rescue operations were continuing and a governmentcommission was established to investigate the accident.   The Independent said blamed Agerpress for ``sparse details'' ofthe sinking, which only began to emerge 10 hours afterward. It saidthe Bulgarian BTA news agency ``was no more informative.''</TEXT></DOC>
