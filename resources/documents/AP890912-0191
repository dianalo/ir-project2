(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jurors watched videos Tuesday showing theopulent lifestyle of PTL founder Jim Bakker, including a4,000-square-foot suite in a hotel at the PTL ministry's HeritageUSA theme park and retreat.   The video tour was conducted by James Taggart, Bakker's formerinterior decorator, who was sentenced to 17 years in prison andfined $500,000 last week for tax evasion while at PTL. Taggart saidthe suite could be divided into three smaller suites for the Bakkersand their two children.   The presidential suite in the Heritage Grand Hotel at HeritageUSA, outside Charlotte at Fort Mill, S.C., was used occasionally bythe Bakkers, who also had a five-level parsonage at nearby LakeWylie.   Reporters could not see the video screen as Taggart describedgold-plated swan bathroom fixtures, antique beds and mirrored wallsin the bedroom. He said the suite included a 10-by-60-foot closetfor Bakker's wife, Tammy Faye.   Bakker is charged with 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy andfaces 120 years and prison and more than $5 million in fines.Prosecutors say he used nearly $4 million in ministry funds tofinance a lavish lifestyle.   Taggart and his brother David were convicted of evading $525,000in income taxes on money they received from PTL. Prosecutors haveindicated they might support a reduction in the Taggarts' sentencesin exchange for testimony against Bakker.   Under cross-examination by defense lawyer Harold Bender, Taggarttestified that other celebrities also used the presidential suite,but they had to be cleared through Bakker's office.   A former PTL attorney, John Yorke, said he sent a memo to his lawfirm boss, former Charlotte mayor Eddie Knox, citing concerns about1983 wages earned by the Bakkers.   ``Together, Jim and Tammy have a monthly income of more than$30,000,'' he said. ``Jim has already received one bonus this yeartotaling $390,000. He could possibly earn more than $1 million thisyear.''   Yorke testified that he warned Bakker about legal problems he sawat PTL, including risking PTL's tax-exempt status because of highsalaries, nepotism and a lack of legal advice at PTL board meetings.   Yorke also described Bakker's reaction to bad news. ``Jim didn'tlike to hear bad news. On several occasions when Eddie (Knox) gotstern with him, he turned around and wouldn't look at him.''   Miller asked how long Bakker would refuse to look at Knox, Yorkesaid, ``Until he left.'' Yorke's firm was replaced as PTL attorneysin 1986.   Guy Forcucci, a certified public accountant who worked for PTL inthe early 1980s and prepared Bakker's individual income tax returns,testified he had warned Bakker as early as 1982 about his highsalary.   Bakker's 1982 tax return showed he earned $290,000, Forcuccitestified. He said he warned Bakker the following year, after thePTL leader's salary rose to $461,000.   PTL's tax-exempt status ultimately was revoked following Bakker'sresignation in March 1987.   In other testimony, Thomas Trask, treasurer of the Assemblies ofGod of Springfield, Mo., testified that Bakker had nearly $794,000in the denomination's retirement account on May 6, 1987. Bakker isbarred from making further contributions because he has beendefrocked by the church.   Michael Dixon, a Franklin, Tenn., music agent for the Bakkers'daughter, Tammy Sue, testified he was paid more than $96,000 by PTLto devise a marketing scheme for Tammy Sue's recordings. Testimonyshowed Bakker purchased more than $600,000 worth of music equipmentfor his home.   U.S. District Judge Robert Potter lectured Bakker for notreporting to his probation officer Monday for a weekly report onmedication he is taking. Bakker's lawyer, Harold Bender, went to theprobation office instead and apologized in court.   Prosecutors continued their practice of this week ofinterspersing testimony about the Bakker's lifestyle with testimonyfrom people who sent them money. Prosecutors contend that Bakkertook money sent by his followers _ called partners if they gave$1,000 _ and didn't use it to construct hotel rooms he promised inbroadcasts and in mailings. Partners were told they could stay freein a PTL hotel once a year.   Sarah Combs of Spanishburg, W.Va., said she and her husband, adisabled coal miner, lived on $400 a month. But they decided to use$1,000 out of $19,000 her husband received for medical compensationfor black lung disease, caused by breathing coal dust, for apartnership in the Heritage Grand Hotel.   But she was never able to stay there, despite repeated attempts,she said.   ``Every time I called, I would talk to someone else and theywould give me a different reason why there wasn't any room,'' shesaid.   In testimony Monday, Taggart said Bakker joked about his financesfor expensive trips, telling those with him to ``thank the PTLpartners.''</TEXT></DOC>
