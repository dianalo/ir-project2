Such a non-invasive method would simplify the lives of thenation's 10 million diabetics who must routinely check theirblood sugar, or glucose, by pricking a finger in order todetermine the doses for their insulin injections. The systemwould also improve the performance of small pumps worn bysome diabetics that automatically inject insulin.   The Storrs, Conn., scientists are basing their study onthe way glucose rotates the polarization of light waves. Withoptical fibers, they beam light at blood and then read theresulting shift in the light's polarization. &quot;The theorydefinitely works,&quot; says Martin Fox, an electrical and systemsengineering professor who is co-developing the sensor.   The team is considering a system that would beam lightinto the eye, where there is fluid containing glucose atabout the same levels present in the bloodstream, Prof. Foxsays. Patients using automatic insulin injection devicesmight wear special glasses equipped with tiny optical fibersaiming an invisible light into an eyeball. The optical fiberscould connect to a small sensor located in the glasses orelsewhere.   &quot;The thing we like about {the eye} is that it's a windowinto the body,&quot; Prof. Fox says.                                                                                                          Fish `Hearing' Opens   Military, Medical World                                                                                                          RESEARCH into how fish hear may improve submarines'ability to listen quietly for enemies and may help doctorsdiagnose disease.   As part of a Navy-backed study, engineers at GeorgiaInstitute of Technology in Atlanta are measuringsound-induced vibrations produced by various parts ofgoldfish, including the inner ear and swim bladder, agas-filled sac that regulates buoyancy.   To monitor a fish's physical responses to sound, thescientists developed and patented a non-invasivevibration-measuring device they believe could be adapted tocheck people for diseased tissue, kidney stones or glaucoma.   Fish use a passive listening system that doesn't alertpredators or prey to their presence. This interests the Navy,because submarines often rely on sonar to locate enemies, andadversaries can hear those sound pulses as they bouncethrough the sea.   To observe a fish's internal responses to sound, theresearchers suspend an anesthetized goldfish in a 50 gallonwater tank. On one side of the fish, a projector broadcasts acontinuous sound wave. On the other side, a transducer aimsan ultrasonic beam into the fish, and a second transducerreceives a beam that has been modified by the sound-inducedvibrations occurring inside the fish. This system enables theresearchers to measure atomic-scale vibrations inside thefish.   A fish is primarily fluid, and its body may rock gently assound waves pass through it. Scientists suspect fish maysense sound when the otolith, a stone-like anchor in theinner ear, interacts with the fish's swaying body,stimulating hair cells that send electrical signals to thebrain. The swim bladder is also believed to be involved increating vibrations in a fish's inner ear.                                                                                                          Shielding Hospital Staff   From Dangerous Cuts                                                                                                          BECAUSE OF concern about the spread of infectious diseasesto health-care workers, new devices are being developed tohelp protect them from accidental needle pricks and scalpelcuts. Such accidents bring medical personnel in contact withpatients' blood and can expose them to infections, includinghepatitis and AIDS.   Syringe Scabbard Systems of Lyndhurst, Ohio, is marketinga table-mounted device resembling a fountain-pen holder inwhich needles can be recapped using only one hand. It wasinvented by a dentist.   Another device, called the Recapper, is also meant to helpworkers safely recap hypodermic needles. Made by On-GardSystems Inc. of Denver, the Recapper resembles the handle ofa sword with a shield to protect the hand grip. A hole in thecenter of the shield grips a needle that is sheathed but thatis otherwise ordinary and retains the sheath as the syringeis pulled away, exposing the needle.   To recap the needle, the hypodermic is reinserted into itssheath, still held by the plastic device as the hand guardprotects against pricks. The syringe and recovered needle areremoved from the Recapper, for disposal, while squeezing itsgrip.   On-Gard says more than 600 of the nation's 6,000 hospitalshave ordered Recappers for trial and that 1,000 of the100,000 dental offices in the U.S. have done so, too. Thedevices can be used over and over.   Allied-Signal Inc., Morris Township, N.J., has designed acut-resistant glove liner to be worn under surgical gloves.The liners are made of Allied's Spectra polyethylene fiber,which is also used in bullet-proof vests. At $40 a pair, theliners offer 17 times more protection than heavy leathergloves and yet allow the wearer to take a pulse or pick up adime.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          WHITE BREAD packaged in carbon dioxide-filled plastic bagskeeps its fresh texture for at least a week, while loaves inair-filled bags lose their fresh feel after a day or two,says a report in the Journal of Food Science. . . . A tickdecoy, patented by an Old Dominion University professor,lures males with a female's sexual odors, then kills withpoison as the male tries to mate with the bait. The inventorplans to sell the traps for use on livestock.</TEXT></DOC>
