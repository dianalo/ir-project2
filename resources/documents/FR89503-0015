Establishment and adjustment ofpatent fees is provided for by section 6 and section 41 of Title 35, UnitedStates Code, and section 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703. Establishment and adjustmentof trademark fees is provided for by section 31 of the Trademark (Lanham)Act of 1946, as amended (15 U.S.C. 1113) and section 103(a) of Pub. L.100-703. Information on the procedures for public use of the automatedsystems, including training, waivers, and the charging of fees also arepresented for information.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>In response to Pub. L. 96-517, the 1980 legislation which amended patentand trademark laws, the Office prepared and submitted a plan for the automationof its operations to Congress on December 13, 1982. The plan centered ontwo basic concepts: the creation of electronic data bases that: (1) Wouldeventually replace the Office's all-paper patent and trademark files, andthereby improve their integrity and quality; and (2) would support searches,examinations, Office actions and other Office functions through electronicworkstations which would provide text and image retrieval capabilitiesand perform other automation functions.Over 700,000 active Federal trademark registrations have been convertedto an electronic data base of textual and digital image data. A computersystem has been installed to enable examiners to search the data base fortextual data and codes describing designs, and to retrieve and displayall information as a substitute for paper file searches. Trademark examinershave been using T-Search exclusively since January 1988, and the capabilityis ready to be deployed for public use in the Trademark Search Library.The T-Search ``dead data base,'' trademarks cancelled, expired or abandonedsince March 1984, also is available to the public, but approximately 17,000images are missing and an additional 184,000 registrations and applicationshave not been quality checked. The trademark examining attorneys do notsearch this data base. The Office is soliciting the public's comments asto whether this data base should be compared to the paper copy and correctedfor use by public searchers at a cost projected to be about $250,000.An Automated Patent System (APS) was installed for test and evaluationpurposes, using one patent examining group as an operational testbed. Majoroperational components of APS, that is, large scale computers with conventionalmagnetic storage devices, a high-speed local area data communications network,and electronic workstations equipped with two high resolution graphic displaysand laser printers were interconnected on July 1, 1986 to enable systemtest and evaluation to begin in the testbed group.On-line access to the full-text of all U.S. patents granted after 1974and then to English language abstracts of Japanese patents was deployedto the patent examining staff beginning in 1986. On-line access to APS-Textpermits examiners to search the text of approximately one million U.S.patents containing more than five billion words. Today, all examiners havebeen trained in the use of the full-text searching tool, and it has becomea routine part of the patent examination process for many examiners. Searchesare conducted from single screen text terminals located throughout theOffice. The APS-Text capability is ready for deployment to the public inthe Patent Search Room.The Office intends to enter the text of virtually all U.S. patents issuedafter 1970. In addition, selected tabular data and chemical and mathemicalequations will have been added to the current full text file. Ultimately,approximately 1.2 million U.S. patents will be available to both patentexaminers and the public for search in full text form.Public evaluation of the APS full-text search capability was conductedbetween January 11 and April 15, 1988. Forty-two (42 public users weretrained on APS-Text during January, 1988 and allowed first-come/first-serveaccess to several terminals. Reactions of public users to APS-Text werepositive. Public users found APS-Text useful for pre-application and state-of-the-artsearches.A total of 38 public users were trained on T-Search during a public evaluationperiod conducted between June and December, 1988. Preliminary review indicatesthat public users considered. T-Search to be valuable both as a primarysource for registrability searching and for verifying paper searches. Inaddition, T-Search was found to facilitate searches by class and ownership.Public Law 100-703, enacted on November 19, 1988, allows the Commissionerto establish reasonable fees for public access to the automated searchsystems while it continues the requirements that no more than 30 percentof automation resources may be from user fees and that the Office may notenter into exchange agreements relating to automatic data processing resources.Section 104(c) of Pub. L. 100-703 allows the Commissioner to waive thepayment by an individual of fees for accessing the automated search systemsupon a showing of need or hardship, and if such waiver is in the publicinterest. The proposed Office policy retains the flexibility authorizedby the enabling legislation to waive fees in appropriate circumstances.The information contained in the automated data bases, which will be availableto the public at the location of the Patent and Trademark Office in Arlington,Virginia, is available free of charge at that location in paper form, andis substantially available through private vendors on-line for a fee. Atthe present time, it is considered to be in the public interest to waivethe proposed fee in situations where access to the data base is neededfor a personal, educational purpose by an individual or member of an educationalor non-profit organization, or where payment of the fee would pose a genuinefinancial hardship to the user.A personal, educational purpose is one in which the person using the database is attempting to satisfy a personal need, and is not conducting asearch or otherwise using the data base for compensation in any form. Examplesof appropriate waiver situations would include students or teachers doinga term paper, or a university professor collecting background informationfor the preparation of an application for a research grant. An exampleof a situation where a waiver would not be appropriate would include anindividual doing work for remuneration_e.g., a law student doing a pre-examinationor infringement search for a law firm.The Commissioner will further consider a fee waiver based on a genuinefinancial hardship. The person requesting a waiver will be required toprovide information that would demonstrate a clear inability to pay thefee.A waiver for the payment of fees is intended to be granted sparingly, andgenerally only where the terminals are available. It is not anticipatedthat fees will be waived for each individual except once or twice eachyear depending on the circumstances. The Commissioner reserves the rightto control access to the data bases and deny a waiver to any individual.In the course of developing criteria, consideration was given to chargingreduced fees to an individual who could claim small entity status as definedin 35 U.S.C. 41(h). However, since it is anticipated that the majorityof people that will be using the automated data bases would be membersof law firms or commercial search services, this approach was obviouslyflawed.As proposed, the waiver policy would apply only to use of the automatedsystem, and not to any service that may also be available to conduct asearch or to the printing or sale of copies. Any abuse of the waiver policycould lead to a ban on the use of any public search facility for that individual.The Office encourages both comments and suggestions on the waiver policythat realistically address the public interest and the need to meet existingfiscal responsibilities.Cost CalculationsThe Office calculated unit costs for all fees based on OMB Circular A-25,and OMB Circular A-130, ``Management of Federal Information Resources.''Costs were determined from the best available records (for example, financialstatements for the Office) and included direct and indirect costs to theOffice of carrying out the activity, as directed by OMB Circular A-25.Proposed user charges for both APS-Text and T-Search were based on themarginal costs of providing these services to the public.In calculating the costs of providing access to T-Search and APS-Text tothe public, the Office followed Congressional direction that fees be reasonableby reflecting the marginal cost for providing the new service and not includingthe costs of designing or installing the automated system for use by Officeexaminers, or the development of the new systems.The marginal costs for one hour terminal session time on APS-Text includea portion of the lease cost of a new computer mainframe which originallywas to be acquired in fiscal year 1990 for use by Office patent examiners.To meet public search requirements, the mainframe is being leased earlierthan originally planned. That portion of lease costs for the eight (8)month period October 1989 through May 1990 over and above the lease costsfor a mainframe sized to meet only examiner needs is being passed on tothe user. After May 1990, the mainframe was intended to be procured andinstalled to support APS. Therefore, no costs are being passed on to thepublic user after that time. When public usage reaches the level wherea mainframe dedicated for public use is required, fee adjustments willbe proposed to pass all of the costs of that mainframe on to the the public.The level of public use will affect the amount of main memory needed tosupport the additional search sessions. It is projected that an additionalincrement of main memory will be required in fiscal years 1991 and 1992.This increment would not be required to support the examiner workload alone.The Office also is proposing to provide some free training and access timeduring training on the automated search systems in accordance with section104(c) of Pub. L. 100-703 which reads, ``. . . a limted amount of freeaccess shall be made available to all users of the systems for purposesof education and training.''Cost of equipment included in the fee calculations for public access includenetwork interface units, text terminals, printer noise dampeners and textterminal printers.Other costs are included for a portion of license fees that must be paidto Chemical Abstracts Service for its proprietary text and structure searchsoftware; additional personnel for the Patent Search Room, and the Officeof Information Systems; computer installation costs; supplies and equipmentdedicated to public use; and general and administrative overhead.The usage rate estimates are based on the three month public user studyperformed from January through March 1988. For this study, 42 frequentPatent Search Room users were selected to be trained in the use of APS-Text.Three text terminals were made available to the trained public users atno charge. During the three month study period, use of the three terminalsaveraged approximately 50 percent. While it is impossible to accuratelypredict future use by a more diverse group of public users, the cost calculationsattempt to take into account such factors and assumptions as:1. Future public users, on average, will use APS-Text less frequently thanthe 42 frequent users selected for the 1988 study, since the study groupwas weighted toward a small number of frequent public searchers, many ofwhom routinely used commercially available automated text search tools.2. Collection of a fee for use (as opposed to the absence of any chargeduring the study) will reduce demand for text search services when comparedwith usage data obtained during the study period. 3. The potential universe of public users is expected to average no morethan 300 per day. 4. The average length of a public user search session is projected to beapproximately 22 minutes_the average length of a search session duringthe 1988 test of public use. 5. Based on the preceding assumptions, if all 300 potential public usersconducted a single search session during a work day, a total of 110 hoursof access would be required. Twenty-five text terminals available fivedays a week, twelve hours a day, will provide a maximum potential of 300hours of available text search time. Under these assumptions, the numberof text terminals appears to be adequate for the foreseeable future. 6. For purposes of actual use of available text terminals, the followingestimates are used: (a) In fiscal year 1990, up to ten terminals will be available during thefirst quarter. An estimate of 45 percent utilization of available textterminal time is projected. By increasing the number of text terminalsto 15 in January 1990 and 20 in April 1990, an estimate of 40 percent utilizationof available text terminal time is projected. By increasing the numberof text terminals to 25 in July 1990, an estimate of 35 percent utilizationof available text terminal time is projected. (b) During fiscal year 1991 and beyond, stable levels of usage should beachieved, yielding an estimated 35 per cent average utilization of the25 available terminals. This utilization rate equates to 105 session hoursper day, or an average of 4.2 session hours per terminal per day. At anaverage of 22 minutes per session, this anticipates a total of 286 searchsessions per day.

This rate is extrapolated from actual usage rates duringthe T-Search public user pilot program which was conducted from June throughDecember 1988. A total of 38 members of the public were trained on T-Search,and about 24 to 28 public users were active on T-Search each month. Overallusage rate of these active users was 14 percent. It is anticipated thatthe overall number of users and the usage rate will double once T-Searchis made available in the Trademark Search Library to all public users ofthat search facility and training is provided on a routine basis.A summary of the fee calculations are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s20,10</C><T4>T-Search_Marginal Cost of One-Hour of Terminal Session Time</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[October 1989-September 1992]</ITAG><H1>Cost Element</H1><H1>Public Share (marginal cost)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Personnel: Compensation and Benefits<D>$195,171</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Hardware and Maintenance<D>$28,809</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Site Preparation<D>$1,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supplies and Forms<D>$3,298</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Subtotal<D>$228,278</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">General and Administrative Overhead<D>$30,932</D><R>n,s</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Total cost<D>$259,210</D><R>n,d</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Estimated Use (hours)<D>5,985</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Unit Cost (per hour)<D>$43.31</D></ITAG></ITAG>The marginal cost for one hour of Office staff search assistance on T-Searchincludes the costs of personnel compensation and benefits.A summary of the fee calculations is as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s20,10</C><T4>T-Search_Marginal Cost of One-Hour of Office Staff Search Assistance</T4><ITAG tagnum="96">[October 1989-September 1992]</ITAG><H1>Cost Element</H1><H1>Public Share (marginal cost)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Personnel: Annual compensation and benefits (Total Cost)<D>$45,659</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Work Hours (per annum)<D>1,776</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Unit Cost (per hour)<D>$25,71</D></ITAG></ITAG>The marginal cost for a period copy generated from T-Search includes costsfor compensation, and supplies and forms.

This procedureis consistent with section 103(b) of Pub. L. 100-703 which allows the Officeto adjust patent fees in the aggregate, and with section 103(a) of Pub.L. 100-703 which allows the Office to adjust trademark fees in the aggregate.The Office has detailed cost calculation worksheets for each fee item,which are available for public inspection in Suite 904 of Building 2, CrystalPark at 2121 Crystal Drive, Arlington, Virginia. Procedures for Public Use of APS-Text and T-Search <ITAG tagnum="81">Patent Search Room Configuration </ITAG>Initially ten (10) text search terminals will be installed and availablefor public use in the Patent Search Room. A printer will be associatedwith each text search terminal. An additional terminal will be locatedin Patent Search Room employee office space for control and administrationactivities. Fifteen (15) more terminals and printers are planned to beadded for public use during fiscal year 1990, if necessary. <ITAG tagnum="81">Trademark Search Library Configuration </ITAG>Initially three (3) T-Search terminals with associated printers will beinstalled and available for public use in the Trademark Search Library.The terminals will be clustered in one area of the Trademark Search Library.An additional terminal will be located in Trademark Search Library employeeoffice space for control and administration activities. Additional terminalsand printers will be added as demand warrants and space permits. Procedures for public use of APS-Text and T-Search have been made as similaras possible in order to provide for consistency in application and easeof administration. Unless specifically stated to apply to only one system,procedures apply to both APS-Text and T-Search. <ITAG tagnum="81">Training </ITAG>To enable prospective public users to become effective on T-Search, four(4) hours of basic training is being offered. T-Search training is expectedto be held in the Crystal City complex. Enrollment in all training classes will be on a lottery basis. Public userswishing to be trained on APS-Text or T-Search, will be required to submitan application form by a specific deadline to allow the Office adequatetime to select, schedule and notify attendees. <ITAG tagnum="81">System Use and Fee Procedures </ITAG>To ensure equity of public access to the automated systems, as well asefficient operations, rules for use will be posted at the terminals. Usersof the systems will be expected to comply with the rules as with otherregulations regarding the use of facilities. Users are strongly encouraged to register in advance for system use. Eachweek, the next week's schedule will be available in the Patent Search Roomand the Trademark Search Library. Should requests for blocks of terminaltime exceed the availability of terminals, limits on the amount of reservedtime may be instituted. Eight (8) of the initial ten (10) terminals inthe Patent Search Room and two (2) of the initial three (3) terminals inthe Trademark Search Library will be allocated to public users with advancereserved times. The remaining terminal in both the Patent Search Room andthe Trademark Search Library will be available for walk-up users and forassisted searches for infrequent users. The terminal time reservation systemand the number of terminals available for walk-up public use and for assistedsearches is subject to change based upon operational experience. All public use of APS-Text and T-Search with the exception of scheduledtraining classes is on a pre-payment basis. In pre-paying for use of thesystems, the public may use a blank signed check, major credit card orcharge to a deposit account. At the end of the search or the pre-paid amountof time, users will receive an accounting from Patent Search Room or TreademarkSearch Library staff for terminal time used and prints produced. The usermust then finalize payment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Specific Rules </ITAG>37 CFR 1.21 Miscellaneous fees and charges Section 1.21, if amended as proposed, would add new paragraph (o) to setthe fees for access to the Automated Patent System full-text search capability(APS-Text) and to provide for the waiver of fees under certain circumstances.Section 1.21, if amended as proposed, would add new paragraph (p) to setthe fees for APS-Text search assistance by Office staff. Section 1.21, if amended as proposed, would add new paragraph (q) to setthe fee for a printed copy from APS-Text. 37 CFR 2.6 Trademark feesSection 2.6, if amended as proposed, would add new paragraph (u) to setthe fees for access to the automated trademark seach system (T-Search)and to provide for the waiver of fees under certain circumstances. Section 2.6, if amended as proposed, would add new paragraph (v) to setthe fees for T-Search search assistance by Office staff. Section 2.6, if amended as proposed, would add new paragraph (w) to setthe fee for a printed copy from T-Search. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Considerations </ITAG>The proposed rule change is in conformity with the requirements of theRegulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354), Executive Orders 12291 and12612, and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3> There are no information collection requirements relatingto patent and trademark fee rules. The Office has determined that this notice has no Federalism implicationsaffecting the relationship between the National Government and the Statesas outlined in Executive Order 12612. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce has certified to theChief Counsel for Advocacy, Small Business Administration, that the proposedrule change will not have a significant adverse economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities (Regulatory Fexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354). Theproposed rules make the Office's on-line, automated patent full-text searchand trademark search systems available to the public at rates significantlyless than commercial systems. The Office has determined that this proposed rule change is not a majorrule under Executive Order 12291. The annual effect on the economy willbe less than $100 million. There will be no major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local governmentagencies, or geographic regions. There will be no significant adverse effectson competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or onthe ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in  </ITAG>37 CFR Part 1 Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, Freedom of Information,Inventions and patents, Lawyers, Reporting and record keeping requirements,Small businesses. 37 CFR Part 2 Administrative practice and procedure, Courts, lawyers, Trademarks.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the Office is proposing to amendTitle 37 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter 1, as set forth below.All proposed additions are printed between arrows (andgreater; andless;) andall deletions are shown between brackets([]).<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1_RULES OF PRACTICE IN PATENT CASES</ITAG>1.
