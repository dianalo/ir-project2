The further credit tightening was approved with the threedissenters complaining that they believed the central bank wasmoving too quickly in its inflation-fighting efforts.   The majority of Fed officials, however, called for the centralbank to ``increase slightly'' its restraint on the reserves held bycommerical banks. Lowering the amount of cash banks have availableto back loans drives up the interest rates charged on those loans.   Since late March, the central bank has engaged in a series ofcredit tightening moves in reaction to a surprisingly strongeconomy which has made job markets tighter and increasedinflationary pressures this year.   Last week, the central bank boosted its discount rate byone-half percentage point to 6.5 percent. An increase in thediscount rate is the most dramatic signal the central bank can sendof its intention to drive interest rates higher as a way ofdampening demand and thus fighting inflationary pressures.   The increase in the discount rate was approved on a unanimousvote. However, back in late June, Fed policy-makers were divided onwhat their next step should be.   Board governors Wayne Angell, Martha Seger and Edward Kelley Jr.opposed the tightening move, arguing that the Fed should wait tosee the impact of its earlier tightening efforts before goingfarther.   But the majority contended that further immediate tightening wasneeded, arguing that there were ``substantial risks'' involved innot moving forcefully to combat inflation. Some Fed members arguedfor an even bolder tightening step than the one taken, arguing foran immediate increase in the discount rate, an action the centralbank eventually took on Aug. 9.   Fed policy-makers met again behind closed doors on Tuesday toassess monetary policy. The minutes of that meeting will not bereleased until Sept. 23. But many private economists believe thecentral bank decided to continue pushing interest rates higher inan effort to slow an economy where demand pressures are bumping upagainst tight labor markets and capacity restraints.   These analysts, however, are not looking for a further boost inthe discount rate until after Nov. 8 because of election-yearpressures.   The Fed tightening so far has pushed up a variety of interestrates, including banks' prime lending rate, which is now at 10percent, the first time it has been in double-digits in three years.   Mortgage rates have been rising as well. The Federal Home LoanMortgage Corp. reported Friday that fixed-rate mortgages now standat 10.71 percent, up from 10.57 percent last week. Analysts arepredicting fixed-rate mortgages will soon top 11 percent.</TEXT></DOC>
