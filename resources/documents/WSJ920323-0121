The FDIC hasjust nationalized CrossLand Savings, FSB, Brooklyn , afterrejecting two outside bids for the thrift that most observersoutside the Beltway thought were pretty generous. Both of thebidders, Chase Manhattan Corp. of New York and Republic NewYork Corp., are large New York bank holding companies. Unlikethe FDIC, they have extensive knowledge of New York's realestate market and considerable experience in managing theliabilities of New York banks.   But William Taylor, the chairman of the FDIC, doesn'tparticularly value the efforts of the private sector andbelieves that the government can do a better job of runningthe nation's troubled banks and thrifts. So the FDIC made aninitial investment of $1.2 billion in CrossLand, a venerablethrift with assets of $7.4 billion -- and $800 million of theFDIC's money was immediately absorbed by losses on bad loans.Mr. Taylor may be acquiring lots of other banks and thriftsin the near future.</LP><TEXT>   Disdaining the term &quot;socialism,&quot; Mr. Taylor has dubbed hisscheme the &quot;bank hospital&quot; plan. The plan beingenthusiastically pursued by Harrison Young, director of theDivision of Resolutions at the FDIC, is simplyreverse-privatization. First the FDIC assumes control of aninsolvent bank, then it pumps in enough FDIC funds to keep itafloat, and finally it installs its own top management to runthe bank.   The FDIC plan is loosely modeled on the 1984 governmenttakeover of Continental Illinois Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago.In that controversial transaction, the FDIC determined thatContinental was so big that allowing it to be liquidatedmight cause a loss of confidence in the nation's bankingsystem. In comparison to CrossLand, the Continentaltransaction looks wonderful. The CrossLand deal appears toextend the FDIC's &quot;too big to fail&quot; policy to include anybank that the agency thinks it can manage better than biddersfrom the private sector.   The FDIC's plan appears inconsistent with the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991(FDICIA). The inconsistency stems from the fact that, underthe FDICIA, the FDIC is required to adopt the failureresolution strategy that imposes the lowest cost on the FDIC.This means that if liquidating a bank will cost the FDIC lessover the long run than nationalizing it, then the FDIC mustliquidate that bank. The &quot;least-cost&quot; requirement wasspecifically intended to reduce the FDIC's flexibility and tolimit rather than expand its ability to engineerContinental-style bailouts.   Contrary to the intent of the statute, the FDIC's approachin CrossLand dramatically extends the &quot;too big to fail&quot;policy in two respects. First, unlike Continental, which wasa large money-center bank, CrossLand is a medium-sized thriftthat nobody argues is &quot;too big to fail.&quot; By nationalizingCrossLand, the FDIC is signaling that it can take over anybank or thrift it wants, no matter how large or small, or howremote the threat to the banking system. Indeed, it isdifficult to see how the FDIC plans to limit its &quot;hospitalplan&quot; to prevent it from nationalizing most, if not all, ofthe 240 banks and thrifts that are significantlyundercapitalized.   Second, when the FDIC bailed out Continental, the agencydefended its actions by claiming that no private-sector bankswere willing to step in and offer bids. This was not the casewith CrossLand.   Moreover, the FDICIA contains a &quot;sense of the Congress&quot;statement that instructs the FDIC that when dealing withinsolvent banks it should rely on &quot;competitive negotiation,&quot;rely on &quot;substantial private investment,&quot; and shouldstructure any resolution so that &quot;the FDIC does not acquire asignificant proportion of the troubled institution's problemassets.&quot; Every one of these principles was violated in theCrossLand deal.   Under the new law, the FDIC is supposed to make agood-faith calculation comparing the costs of the variousresolution methods. It then must choose the least-costlymethod. Instead of doing this in the CrossLand deal, itappears that the FDIC based its decision on two dubiousassumptions.   First, it apparently assumed that the real estate marketin New York will rebound quickly so that the FDIC can profitfrom holding onto CrossLand's assets, which are mostly in theform of real estate investments. Otherwise there is no way itcould conclude that holding and &quot;managing&quot; CrossLand's assetsis a superior strategy to limiting the FDIC's exposure to itscurrent level by simply liquidating the thrift.   Second, the FDIC seems to have assumed that interest-ratelevels will increase dramatically in the near future so thatthe above-market rates currently being paid by CrossLand fortime deposits eventually will come back into line.Unfortunately for the FDIC, if interest rates go up, thenreal estate values are likely to go down. That is one reasonoutside observers think the FDIC has made a very costlymistake in taking over CrossLand.   The reason the problems of the banking industry keepgetting worse become clear once one understands the mentalityof the bureaucrats at the FDIC who regulate banks. Theseregulators seem to prefer spending $20 billion five yearsfrom now to fix an insolvent bank to spending $5 billiontoday to fix the same bank. Perhaps this is because there areenormous political benefits to be derived from keepinginsolvent banks afloat, and significant political costsinvolved in realizing losses early, particularly in anelection year.   By delaying action, the bureaucrats and politicians loyalto the agency can pretend that the banking industry'sproblems are smaller than they really are. Congress and thepress measure the severity of the banking crisis by the sizeof the FDIC's cash disbursements each year. People seem tothink that the FDIC is performing better in years when itmakes lower disbursements. But the FDIC's strategy ofdelaying the recognition of the banking industry's losses isonly making the ultimate resolution of the problem morecostly. This problem is exacerbated by the fact that FDICbureaucrats come and go with amazing rapidity. By putting offhard decisions, these regulators can force their successorsto take the blame for their decisions.   A possible political angle to the FDIC's actions seems toemerge in light of its recent decision to guarantee certainunderperforming loans in New England. Could it be that theFDIC has been pressured into playing election-year politicsby using bank insurance funds to conduct its own home-mademonetary policy in an attempt to jump-start the region'seconomy on the eve of the New Hampshire primary?   The FDIC should ignore politics and recognize thatsignificant savings can be realized from liquidatinginsolvent financial institutions and realizing losses early.If a financial institution can be closed and liquidated atthe moment it becomes insolvent, depositors can be paid infull without any cost to the deposit-insurance fund or totaxpayers. This is because a bank's assets will just equalits liabilities (including liabilities to insured depositors)at the precise moment it becomes insolvent. Liquidating abank at that point will result in losses to shareholders, butnot to the FDIC.   If we've learned anything from the bank failures of the1980s, we've learned that once a bank reaches the point ofinsolvency, its assets tend to decrease in value at anever-increasing rate. This is particularly true of bankassets controlled by regulators.   CrossLand has been insolvent for more than three years,and had lost $739 million in the 21 months prior to beingtaken over by the FDIC. So much for early resolution. Duringthe time when Crossland was a &quot;zombie bank,&quot; economicallyinsolvent and kept alive only thanks to regulatoryforbearance, it obtained much needed cash by payingsignificantly above-market interest rates for deposits,further increasing costs to the FDIC, which plans to fulfillthese financial obligations. These lucky depositors aredelighted that the FDIC has nationalized CrossLand, since nowthey will continue to enjoy receiving abovemarket rates oncertificates of deposit bought before the changeover.   Scores of financial institutions were contacted to bid onCrossLand. There were only two reported bids for the thrift,and these bids were not acceptable to the FDIC. Perhaps theFDIC thinks that by rejecting the CrossLand bids it willprompt more aggressive bidding for other banks in the future.If so, it is sorely mistaken, because the likely effect ofthe CrossLand resolution will be to discourage seriousbidders from incurring the heavy costs of assembling bids.Moreover, the FDIC should not have quickly rejected thelikelihood that the many potential bidders who looked atCrossLand knew something about the marketplace the FDICdoesn't.   ---   Mr. Macey is a professor at Cornell Law School.
