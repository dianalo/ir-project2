At least 245people were reported killed nationwide.   Another 378 were wounded since the rebels attacked Saturdaynight in their biggest offensive since 1981, according to the armedforces funeral home, civilan morgues and hospitals and unofficialmilitary figures.   Thousands of civilians were trapped in their homes by theexchange of gunfire between Farabundo National Liberation Frontrebels and soldiers. Helicopters and military planes overflew thecity, shooting at rebel positions.   Fighting also was reported outside Usulutan, a major easterncity, but not in the city itself.   The rebels, in their biggest offensive since 1981, dug trenchesand perched in tall buildings in San Salvador and attacked militaryposts in at least four of El Salvador's 14 provinces. Fightingbegan Saturday, and the sound of mortars and gunfire still echoedthrough San Salvador's deserted streets early today.   U.S. Embassy spokesman Barry Jacobs said army troops had beenordered to avoid civilian casualties and that was slowing thecounteroffensive.   The rebels launched the offensive after pulling out of peacetalks to protest a series of attacks on leftist political and unionleaders, which they blamed on the U.S.-backed government.   Rightist President Alfredo Cristiani, whose official residencewas attacked in the offensive's early hours, declared a state ofsiege, rescinding basic civil rights and imposing a 6 p.m. to 6a.m. curfew nationwide.   Also targeted was the home of the president of the country'slegislature.   Military and medical officials said at least 139 people had beenkilled and 317 wounded since Saturday. It was not known how manycasualties occurred in the capital.   Carlos Mendoza, a Red Cross spokesman, said at least 20civilians were among the dead. They included an American teacher inSan Salvador.   The U.S. Embassy in San Salvador refused to identify theteacher, however a Spokane, Wash., woman said the victim was her25-year-old son, Christopher Babcock.   Kay Babcock told the Spokane Chronicle and Spokesman-Review thatSpokane police told her that her son was killed when he was hit inthe head by a grenade fragment late Saturday.   The rebels claimed 400 soldiers were killed or wounded and gaveno casualty figures for their own forces.   The northern section of San Salvador was held by heavily armedrebels. It was the heaviest fighting in the city of 440,000 sincethe war broke out 10 years ago.   In the eastern suburb of Soyapango, where guerrillas also heldlarge sectors, a young fighter said rebels were holding theirpositions. ``The order is that instead of retreating, we shouldadvance inside,'' Beatriz, the 18-year-old combatant, said.   About 300 yards away, paratroopers took up attack positions.Eight bodies, apparently of guerrillas, lay in the street.   Area residents chatted with the guerrillas, complaining of foodand water shortages. Few tried to go to work, and many businesseswere closed.   Late Sunday, rebel snipers took up posts in the high floors ofbuildings and dug trenches with the help of San Salvador residents.   ``All the northern zone (of the city) is classified ascritical,'' said Pedro Varela of the Red Cross. He also said someeastern sections of the capital ``are very dangerous.''   A church lay worker speaking on condition of anonymity said hesaw government helicopters bomb a camp of homeless people inEmanual, a northern part of the city.   He said five people died in one tin shack that took a direct hitand that many were wounded as government forces tried to dislodgerebels who had taken up positions in the area.   A guerrilla leader who identified himself as Commander Fernandeztold reporters in a northern neighborhood, ``Here we will diefighting. They won't remove us from here.''   On national television, Cristianiannounced the state of siege,suspending rights of assembly as well as free speech and movement.   ``The terrorists must know that there are judicial tools tofight these irrational attacks,'' he said.   The rebels declared a nationwide ban on traffic and ordered allgas stations to close. They enforce such bans with sabotage. Jacobssaid they also were attacking transit police.   Both sides made public appeals for international support andclaimed they held the upper hand.   Cristiani called the offensive ``indiscriminate terrorism.'' Heleads the rightist Nationalist Republican Alliance, or Arena, andtook office June 1 after winning a presidential election.   His party has been linked to death squads that operated withnear impunity in the war's early years and are blamed for most ofits 70,000 deaths.   The rebel Farabundo Marti Liberation Front, in a radiobroadcast, tied the offensive to the Oct. 31 bombing of theNational Federation of Salvadoran Workers union hall in thecapital. That attack killed 10 people and wounded more than 30, andthe rebels blamed it on the government.   Rebel leaders on Wednesday pulled out of a third round of peacetalks with the Cristiani's administration, claiming it has not beenserious about negotiating an end to the conflict.   In Washington, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called the rebeloffensive ``an act of desperation by a debilitated guerrillaforce.'' The U.S. government has backed successive Salvadoranadministrations in their war with the rebels.   Government troops and a tank entered El Salvador NationalUniversity on Sunday and damaged some buildings when they openedfire, a photographer said.   Twelve students and workers were detained and taken to amilitary base, according to the photographer. He said the prisonerswere accused of harboring guerrillas.</TEXT></DOC>
