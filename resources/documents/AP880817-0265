Israel Televisionreported that a 9-year-old Palestinian girl was killed whensoldiers put down a West Bank riot.   Hospital officials said Israeli troops beat 105 Arabs in theoccupied Gaza Strip, where a curfew was imposed for three days in arow, and soldiers barred West Bank Palestinians from enteringJerusalem during a daylong protest strike.   Early Thursday the army lifted the curfew in the main Gaza Stripcities, but curfews remained in effect in several of the coastalstrip's refugee camps.   Eight West Bank villages also were under round-the-clockcurfews, but the orders did not prevent scattered protests in whichnine Palestinians were wounded. Israeli radio reported six woundedin the Nablus area of the occupied West Bank, and the army saidthree were wounded in the Gaza Strip.   In the West Bank town of Jenin, 9-year-old Rasha Artawi waskilled while troops dispersed a riot, Israel Television said. Itquoted Arab reports as saying the girl was killed by a stray bullet.   However, army officials told the television that a local doctorsaid the girl was killed by a stone. An army spokesman reached byThe Associated Press said he had no information about the case.   The fatality brought to 248 the number of Palestinians killed inthe 8-month-old uprising. Four Israelis also have been killed.   The four deportees allegedly were members of outlawedPalestinian guerrilla groups and incited the Arab uprising, thearmy said.   They were flown by helicopter to Lebanon, given $50 each andreleased, military sources said. They were identified as MohammedGharableh, Ahmed abu Muailek, Yusri Darwish al Hums and FathiIbrihim Shakaki, all from the Gaza Strip.   The United States has protested Israel's policy of deportations,but Israel defends the measure as the most effective means ofdeterring violence. Since the Dec. 8 start of the uprising, 33Palestinians have been deported.   The army also handed deportation orders to 15 more Arabs fromthe West Bank and 10 from Gaza, accusing them in a statement of``leading the uprising ... and taking direction from terroristorganizations.''   The statement said the 25 Arabs belonged to local Palestiniancommittees that intended to fill a power gap left by King Hussein'sdecision to disengage Jordan from the West Bank.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin warned Wednesday that Israelwould crack down on the local committees with ``whatever force weare allowed by law.''   ``I wish we could end violence by spreading flowers. I wish wecould end it by sitting around the table sipping coffee. But Ibelieve these are not practical options,'' Rabin said.   Tensions remained high following a riot Tuesday at a prison forPalestinians in which army troops killed two Arabs.   ``I have never seen anything like it in my life,'' an Israeliofficer who witnessed the riot in Ketziot near the Egyptian bordertold the daily Haaretz. ``Nearly 1,000 prisoners, as though onorder, started rioting in Block No. 1 ... throwing stones andclimbing the walls.''   The inmates also threw tent poles and pieces of cots at prisonguards, Israel state-run radio in Arabic reported.   Another senior official described prison conditions as crowdedand tense. ``The place is a time bomb,'' he told Haaretz. Neitherwas identified by name, in keeping with army regulations.   The prison, which houses about 2,500 inmates in tents circled bybarbed wire, was opened in March to hold Arabs jailed forparticipating in the rebellion against Israeli rule.   Military officials disagreed on the cause of the riot, with somesaying it appeared triggered by news reaching Ketziot of anindefinite curfew imposed on Gaza. Others said the inmates beganprotesting when they saw visiting Red Cross representatives.   In Geneva, Red Cross spokeswoman Francoise Deron confirmedrepresentatives visited the prison Tuesday but told the AP theriots occurred in a section the delegates did not tour. Shedeclined to comment on conditions in the prison.   Maj. Gen. Yitzhak Mordechai, the Gaza Strip commander, visitedthe prison Wednesday and appointed a committee to investigate theriot.   A copy of a letter written by inmates and smuggled out ofKetziot complained of ``brutal conditions'' and called onauthorities to close the prison immediately.   The letter was not specific about conditions but said theinmates were beginning a hunger strike. ``Yes to the pangs ofhunger, no to surrender,'' it said.   In Gaza, Shifa Hospital officials said 105 Palestinians weretreated for beating injuries, mostly bruises, said Dr. AhmedYazeji, Shifa's chief surgeon.   He said the injuries appeared caused by beatings with ``clubsand rifle butts and kicking with heavy military boots.''   He added that 90 percent of the victims said they were beaten intheir homes by troops searching for suspected stone-throwers.   An army official said he could not confirm the beating injuries.</TEXT></DOC>
