The new criticism escalated a war of words over the attackbetween the Palestine Liberation Organization and Egypt,jeopardizing efforts to organize Israel-Palestinian peace talks.   The article by editor Ibrahim Seda on the front page of themass-circulation weekly Akhbar el-Yom's was the third articlecriticizing the PLO since the attack Sunday. But it was the firstthat blamed Arafat himself.   All three articles appeared in state-owned newspapers and werewritten by their top editors, all known to be close to Mubarak.   The media onslaught signaled strains in relations between Egyptand the PLO. Such tensions imperil American efforts to organizePalestinian-Israeli peace talks because Egypt has been relaying PLOpositions to both the United States and Israel.   Israel outrage over the attack has also made organizing suchtalks more difficult.   Mubarak sent a message to Arafat this week that sources close tothe government said was believed to have voiced displeasure overthe PLO's reaction to the attack.   The PLO said Monday in Tunisia that the incident should beplaced in the context of the hundreds of Palestinians who died inthe 26-month-old uprising against Israeli occupation of the WestBank and Gaza Strip.   In his article, Seda called the statement ``flimsy and silly''for omitting a denunciation of the terrorist attack and comparingit to the violence in the occupied lands.   The bus carrying 31 Israeli vacationers was attacked by twogunmen, who showered it with automatic fire and hand grenades on adesert highway between Cairo and the Suez Canal city of Ismailia.Newspapers have quoted security officials as saying the gunmen werePalestinians but that no arrests have been made.   ``We expected Yasser Arafat to react by flying to Cairoimmediately to declare to the world his personal and thePalestinian people's condemnation of this criminal act,'' Sedawrote in his weekly, which claims a circulation of more than 1million.   He said Arafat should at least have broadcast a statement ``inhis own voice'' censuring the attack and vowing to ``help theEgyptian security apparatus uncover the Palestinian terroristperpetrators.''   The PLO's Cairo representative, Saeed Kamal, told the MiddleEast News Agency today that his organization was cooperating withEgyptian security authorities, passing to them any information ithad about the ambush.   However, Kamal said he could not rule out the possibility of``Israeli responsibility'' for the attack, aiming to obstruct peacetalks.   The chill in Egyptian-PLO relations was the worst since Mubarakshut down seven PLO offices in Egypt for seven months in 1987 afterthe Palestine National Council, the organization's parliament inexile, criticized Cairo's 1979 peace treaty with Israel.   Another state-owned newspaper, Al-Ahram, today reported that theambush was plotted inside Israel or the occupied territories.   The newspaper quoted an unidentified Interior Ministry officialfor the report.</TEXT></DOC>
