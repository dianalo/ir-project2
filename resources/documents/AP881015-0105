It said 77 people wererescued.   The Coast Guard said the 35-ton Balangiga was sailing from theSamar island port of Giporlos to Tacloban on Leyte island when itsank early Friday after being buffeted by high winds and rough seas.   Lt. Cesar Cahijas, Coast Guard commander in Tacloban, said fourvessels were dispatched to the area for search and rescueoperations.   Coast Guard officials said the vessel was authorized to carry 92passengers and crew. They did not say whether all those aboard theship had been accounted for.   In Manila, Coast Guard officials said they were still awaiting acomplete report from Tacloban.   Overloading is common on inter-island ferries in thePhilippines. Last December, more than 3,000 people died when thepassenger ship Dona Paz, which was sailing from Tacloban to Manila,collided with an oil tanker off Mindoro island in the world's worstpeacetime shipping disaster.   A congressional report cited widespread safety problems inPhilippine commercial shipping, including faulty communications andlax rescue procedures.   The Coast Guard, which is responsible for commercial shippingwithin this archepeligo country of 7,100 islands, conducted its owninvestigation but has not released the findings.   Last May, at least 53 people died when a motor launch sank inthe same area as Friday's mishap.</TEXT></DOC>
