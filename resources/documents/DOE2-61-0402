Asearch for DBR using a specially built spectrometer in the elementarypion production channel: P + P-andgt;P + P +{pi}/sup 0/ is described. A C12target was bombarded by 800 MeV protons. The shape of the spectrum isconsistent with corresponding charged {pi} figures. Results show thatthe system, after modifications, can be used to hunt DBR.</TEXT></DOC>
