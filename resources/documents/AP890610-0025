China also criticized a Voice of America radio broadcast forreporting that troops killed 3,000 residents, and it claimedsoldiers ``did not fire even once'' in their push to drivepro-democracy protesters from Tiananmen Square.   Deng Xiaoping, 84, emerged Friday from three weeks of seclusionto praise soldiers who crushed the pro-democracy protests and showwho is leading the world's most populous country. Despite Deng'sshow of political stability, foreigners continued to flee Chinatoday.   On Friday night, the nationally televised news accused FangLizhi, a leading astrophysicist and China's best-known dissident, ofbeing a traitor who incited the ``rebellion'' and provoked theviolence. Fang, who avoided the student protests on TiananmenSquare, has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy.   The official attack on Fang and the U.S. decision to protect himcould strain relations between China and the United States, whichhas condemned the violent crackdown on the pro-democracydemonstrators.   The nationally televised news tonight said the 400 people whowere arrested included Gua Haifeng, a Beijing University student whowas secretary of the United Association of Beijing Universities, theindependent student group that led seven weeks of protests.   It said several other students and workers were arrested but gaveno other names. It showed footage of non-students, identified onlyas ``scoundrels,'' being questioned by police, one under gunpoint.   Western reporters saw soldiers take three people into custody atgunpoint on the street.   The arrests came as the government intensified a propagandacampaign that claimed troublemakers and counterrevolutionaries wereresponsible for the violence last weekend, when soldiers in tanksrolled into central Beijing and recaptured Tiananmen Square fromstudent protesters.   The U.S. Embassy in Beijing today sent a convoy to nearby Tianjinto evacuate 89 foreign tourists, students, scholars and oiltechnicians. Most were Americans. They said Tianjin had been quietthe past week but that they were leaving because the U.S. StateDepartment recommended it.   Also today, the People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper,accused the U.S. government-backed Voice of America of being``irresponsible'' in reporting that 3,000 people died.   The newspaper said the U.S. broadcast was aimed at instigatinghatred and resistance.   Official Radio Beijing said today: ``In the process of clearingout the square (Tiananmen), the Liberation Army did not fire evenonce at the crowd of people.''   The Chinese government has said 300 died in the military assault,and most of the dead and injured were soldiers attacked by rioters.Doctors and witnesses have estimated that thousands were fatallyshot along the road and in the square, and U.S. intelligence reportsput the death toll at about 3,000.   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and60,000 injured, according to the Union of Chinese Students in theFederal Republic, a Chinese group in West Germany.   Chinese-language broadcasts of VOA and the British BroadcastingCo. are hugely popular among people trying to obtain informationabout events in China outside the government-controlled media. SomeVOA channels have been jammed since martial law was imposed onBeijing on May 20.   Since last weekend, official television and radio have repeatedlypraised the military and accused demonstrators of beingcounterrevolutionaries bent on destroying the socialist system.   Authorities have told all participants in the movement to turnthemselves in. Phone numbers have been provided so citizens can turnin protesters.   Beijing radio said today that city officials had received 167``important'' reports by Friday afternoon on the hotlines.   Deng appeared on national television Friday night with other topofficials and in an impassioned speech to military officers, gavethe clear message that he was in control.   Among those accompanying him was conservative Premier Li Peng.Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang, reported to have been ousted frompower for opposing the martial law crackdown, was absent.   Deng, while initiating bold economic reforms over the past decadewhich have improved the lives of millions of China, is a politicalconservative who regards ferment for greater freedom as a threat tothe state.   In Beijing, tens of thousands of troops remain, with largecontingents at Tiananmen Square and in the university area to thenorthwest. Armed soldiers were seen guarding a truck bringingvegetables into the city and stopping cars to ask for identification.   Demonstrations, some violent, have broken out in more than adozen Chinese cities since the assault on Beijing last weekend.   The official media have reported dozens of arrests of people whojoined in anti-government protests. Television showed soldierspatrolling the southwestern city of Chengdu and the ruins of adepartment store burned by protesters. Police were shown makingarrests in Wuhan, Changsha and Harbin, among the cities whereprotesters burned buses and blocked roads.</TEXT></DOC>
