ProposalIs 'Without Substance'</HL><DD> 02/25/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JNSV VULTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><DATELINE> BRAINTREE, Mass.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jones andamp; Vining Inc. said Vulcan Corp.'s $5-a-share bid for the company doesn't comply with federal securities laws and is &quot;without substance.&quot;    In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Jones andamp; Vining asserted that Vulcan didn't file a tender offer statement with the SEC. Jones andamp; Vining also said in the filing that it won't make a recommendation on Vulcan's bid.    Wallace Pearson, vice president and treasurer at Vulcan in Cincinnati, said the company counsel yesterday was seeking a meeting with officials at Jones andamp; Vining to pursue Vulcan's proposal. Mr. Pearson said, &quot;We very carefully phrased our announcement&quot; regarding its $5-a-share proposal for Jones andamp; Vining, but wouldn't comment on the details of the SEC filing.    As previously reported, Vulcan earlier this month said it is willing to pay $5 a share, or a total of about $18.5 million, for Jones andamp; Vining's common. Both companies make shoe materials.    Last month, Jones andamp; Vining's board approved a $4.50-a-share leveraged buyout proposal by a management group. The proposal is subject to shareholder approval. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely with borrowing. Ultimately the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    Jones andamp; Vining stock closed yesterday in over-the-counter trading on the national market at $5 a share, unchanged.    Separately, Jones andamp; Vining said a lawsuit was filed in Delaware Chancery Court against the company and certain of its officers and directors, alleging that its proposed leveraged buyout price is inadequate. The suit, filed by Ronda Inc., one of Jones andamp; Vining's shareholders, seeks an injunction blocking the leveraged buyout if a higher price isn't offered by the management group, an attorney representing Jones andamp; Vining said.    Jones andamp; Vining said it believes the suit is unfounded and intends to defend vigorously against it. </TEXT></DOC>
