Nuclear energy development has been successfullypromoted for more than thirty years, the non-nuclear energy technologiesfor almost 15 years. As a result of this support for new technologies,energy production has become more efficient and cost-effective and withregard to fossil energy sources also markedly less detrimental to theenvironment. Nuclear energy research policy is an integral part of energyresearch policy as a whole, which particularly aims to increasingly promoterenewable energy sources, above all photovoltaic and wind energy, theutilization of biomass and geothermal energy as well as the developmentof various energy storage methods. In addition to some mining projectswhich aim to reduce coal production costs, promotion in the field offossil energy sources concentrates above all on power plant engineeringand combustion techniques - i.e. environment-oriented technologies. Inview of future supply patterns, projects on coal conversion are continued;withpresent supply and price structures for mineral oil and natural gas,however, commercialization of coal conversion cannot be expected to belaunched on a large scale.
