U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady on Friday unveiled theproposal that endorses voluntary efforts by commercial banks toforgive part of the $410 billion they are owed by the largest debtorcountries, including Brazil, Mexico and Venezuela.   In so doing, Brady signalled that the Bush administration intendsto shed the 1985 ``Baker Plan,'' promoted by then-Treasury SecretaryJames A. Baker III, that had favored new lending instead of debtforgiveness.   The government of Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari,which is trying to restructure payments on its $107 billion debt,called Brady's suggestions ``a first and positive response toMexico's position.   ``The change of emphasis that gives priority to the reduction ofthe debt and its servicing, and not to further indebtedness as wasthe case in the past, is particularly positive,'' Mexico's TreasuryDepartment said in a statement.   Salinas ordered Mexican Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe toWashington on Monday to take up the proposal with Brady.   The Argentine government said the proposal was ``a promising stepforward,'' and that it hoped follow-up developments ``are congruentwith the expectations awakened'' by the plan.   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela, where rioting lastweek over government austerity measures spurred by the nation'sforeign debt left more than 300 dead, had a lukewarm reaction.   ``I think the (proposals) are very timid and that they do notsatisfy the minimum aspirations of Latin America,'' Perez said.   ``However, this opening will lead us to a dialogue with theadministration of President Bush (that will result) in a betterunderstanding of the situation we are going through and our urgentneeds,'' Perez added.   In Brazil, the Third World's largest debtor nation, FinanceMinister Mailson da Nobrega called reports of the new plan ``verypositive.''   But he warned the crushing debt continued to threaten politicalstability in Latin America. Without decisive action from creditorcountries, ``populists and demagogues'' will arise to power, daNobrega warned.   ``People will believe in messiahs. Radical groups will replacemoderate ones,'' he said.   The Venezuelan riots were a ``clear alert'' that Latin America'sdebt situation is ``socially and politically unbearable,'' he added.   Brazil, which in 1985 returned to civilian government after 21years of military rule, holds presidential elections on Nov. 15, thefirst popular vote since 1960. Media polls show leftist leaders withhigh popularity.   Latin American nations have spent $139 billion since 1984 toservice the debt, but with no appreciable reduction of indebtedness,according to the Latin American Economic System, a regionalthink-tank based in Caracas, Venezuela.   To encourage the banks to forgive part of the debt, the Bushadministration called on the World Bank and the InternationalMonetary Fund to help provide guarantees for the remaining debt owedby the poor countries.   Emphasizing its initiative, the administration late Friday saidit was extending a $450 million emergency loan for Venezuela. Theshort-term financing is to be repaid when Venezuela begins receivingnew loans from the IMF in April.   Brazil's Planning Ministry announced Friday the World Bank hadoffered Brazil $1 billion for electric power development, despitepast objections to the country's nuclear energy program.   In a joint communique, the ministry and bank also said the bankhad offered a special 2-year aid program to help Brazil meet thebank's requirements for matching funds.   Foreign credits are essential to Brazil's efforts to service its$115 billion foreign debt. Each year, Brazil pays between $12billion and $14 billion on interest payments alone.   Mexico paid $14 billion in interest and principal in 1988 andwill pay another $16 billion this year. Latin America's other bigdebtors are Argentina, $50 billion, and Venezuela, $33 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
