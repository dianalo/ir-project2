The victories ``will help set a new direction in black politics''because black candidates were successful in many cases where theblack voting population remains a very small minority, said LindaWilliams, a fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School forGovernment.   On Tuesday, David Dinkins was elected as the first black mayor ofNew York and L. Dougles Wilder was apparently elected as governor ofVirginia. If Wilder's apparent victory holds up, he will become thenation's first black governor.   Blacks also took control of city halls in New Haven, Conn.;Seattle; Cleveland, and Durham, N.C. In Detroit, Coleman Young waselected to an unprecedented fifth term as mayor.   ``One of the first sort of practical developments I think we'llsee is more blacks taking a chance, running in places where blacksare not the majority,'' said Williams, who specializes in race andpolitics.   She said blacks chose not to run previously under thosecircumstances because they saw little likelihood of winning.   But Williams and other analysts say the exhilaration blacks mayfeel with these successes is tempered by the moderation of thecandidates and their campaigns. Some analysts argued that thewinners were forced to be moderate, almost to the exclusion ofeconomic and social issues more traditionally associated with blackcandidates.   Williams noted that both Wilder and Dinkins distanced themselvesfrom the Rev. Jesse Jackson, twice a presidential candidate.   But Jackson dismissed attempts to ``disconnect'' himself fromTuesday's electoral victories.   ``If, after the '88 campaign of Dukakis, there had been anincrease in Greek registration, if you now had a Greeek chairman ofthe Democratic Party and a Greek governor of Virginia and mayor ofNew York and New Haven and Seattle and Cleveland, no one would betrying to find the disconnection because the connection would be sovery apparent,'' Jackson told reporters outside the WashingtonHilton Hotel.   ``It was clear that the (Roger) Ailes forces were going to use meas the Willie Horton force for polarization,'' in New York, saidJackson in a reference to George Bush's use of a black Massachusettsmurderer in what many termed a negative 1988 presidential campaignagainst Michael Dukakis. Ailes is a campaign consultant.   ``We stepped back strategically,'' Jackson said.   ``If we're members of the same team, does it really matter whoscored the touchdown. If we're members of the same team, if we winthe championship, all of us get the ring,'' Jackson said.   Other analysts say the elections may signal harder rather thaneasier times for black politicians and their base constituency.   ``What we're going to have is that it's going to make it muchmore difficult for the black community,'' said James Turner, apolitical sociologist at Cornell University.   Turner called the victors ``clubhouse politicians'' who ``havesaid they are not going to speak to the black community while theyassume their support.''   ``These people have taken a very cautious, moderate position, akind of non-economic liberal position,'' Turner said.   ``I think this could be deceiving because it has not prepared thewhite electorate for the really difficult decisions,'' said Turner.   Of political candidates who still want to run on the platformmore geared toward the poor, Williams said, ``I'm not sure that theywill see a lot of hope for that strategy.''   ``If they (Dinkins and Wilder) couldn't have done what they did,it really would have been a hopeless situation,'' said Williams,also noting that many of Tuesday's victors are black politicians whoworked their way up the Democratic Party structure.   Williams said that although both Dinkins and Wilder garneredsupport from many of the whites who voted for Jackson in 1988 theirsuccesses Tuesday ``may show him he'll have to moderate it even moreand change his campaign style.''</TEXT></DOC>
