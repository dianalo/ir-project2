(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>THE BATTLE FOR the desktop continues to heat up.andP;  OS/2 was gaining on DOS andappeared to be the clear favorite.andP;  But then delays on the 32-bit version ofOS/2 were announced.andP;  At the same time, sneak previews of Windows 3.0 weregenerating excitement.andP;  DOS gained momentum, OS/2 slipped.andP;  But what aboutUnix on the desktop? Can it succeed? Or is Unix destined to remainexclusively as one of the primary server technologies, distributingapplications and services to DOS and OS/2 clients?andM;Me Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) is betting on both client and server roles forUnix.andP;  To that end, the company, along with Digital Equipment Corporation,Locus Computing Corporation, Relational Technology Incorporated, and TandyCorporation, introduced Open Desktop in early 1989, which SCO is calling acomplete graphical operating system.andP;  Open Desktop is actually an integratedoffering of SCO Unix, DOS, networking services, and SQL relational DBMS(RDBMS), all operating under a graphical user interface and Desktop Manager.andO;The offering runs on a 386 or 486 workstation with 6MB and a 100MB hard disk.andO;SCO hopes the product will become the de facto Unix desktop and that ISVswill flock to the platform, thus providing customers with retail,shrink-wrapped Unix applications to mn on Weir PCs.andM;Product PhilosophyandM;When SCO et al.andP;  took a good look at the market in 1988, it was about thetime hopes were being pinned on the OS/2 desktop environment.andP;  The collectedcompanies recognized that OS/2 might not prove to be the savior desktopplatform that it claimed to be.andP;  Naturally, with its Unix bias, SCO startedconsidering the possibility of Unix claiming some of the desktop real estatein commercial markets.andM;PIECES ALL IN PLACE.andP;  According to Doug Michels, executive vice president ofSCO, all the pieces were there.andP;  Customers were becoming perfectly willing toinvest in 386 hardware with VGA monitors, a configuration which issatisfactory for graphical windowing environments.andP;  Michels acknowledges thata 386 is not necessarily the optimum platform for robust windowingapplications, but it is, he states, satisfactory.) In addition, memory priceswere  dropping, so the earlier limits were going away.andP;  The way Michels seesit, the hardware was there, TCP/IP and NFS were there, Unix was there, XWindow was just about mature enough, and the only missing piece was agraphical user interface.andP;  Then along came Motif from OSF.andP;  According toMichels, &quot;Motif was a natural for the PC part of the industry.&quot; The look andfeel is much like OS/2 Presentation Manager's, and the Motif toolkit wasstable enough for ISVs developing applications.andM;MISSING: TARGET DEVELOPMENT PLATFORM.andP;  Still, something was holding back Unixon PCs-a lack of a target platform for developers.andP;  ISVs didn't know what towrite to.andP;  Even though the industry had pretty much settled on Unix V.2 as ade facto standard, no single graphical user interface  (GUI) or networkingprotocol had emerged as a clear leader.andP;  Even if a software developer pickeda platform and protocol, the user was stuck with elaborate installationprocedures to make sure every piece of the architecture worked togethercorrectly.andP;  You couldn't just install the application and get going' You hadto install all the drivers, all the transports, etc.andP;  for each application.andO;The installation process became very complicated.andP;  &quot;If we left it to theusers, they might never get it configured quite right,&quot; warns Michels.andM;SCO, along with many others in the industry, recognized the need for a commonplatform that provided three aspects: the GUI, the operating system, and thetransports--a single platform environment for desktop Unix.andP;  In addition, theenvironment needed to include a networked SQL engine.andP;  According to Michels,&quot;Modem applications will be written to assume underlying corporate data.andO;Embedded SQL is the current standard-the only one we've got.andP;  Networked SQLhas to be part of any modem platform.&quot;andM;INDUSTRY CATCH-22.andP;  So, basically, the Unix desktop market faces a catch-22:Customers won't buy into the platform because there are so few applications;on the other hand, ISVs don't see sufficient market potential to justifydevelopment costs.andP;  As a result, few developers are building innovativegraphical networked Unix applications.andM;With a clear target platform, Michels anticipates, developing these  ofapplications will become more attractive to software vendors.andP;  And, wheninnovative commercial applications are available, more customers will buy.andM;Michels sees the resolution of this catch-22 as a particular boon for thosecompanies committed to running on open systems, including the U.S.andO;government.andM;THE ROLE OF OPEN DESKTOP.andP;  SCO took a bold step, integrating together anumber of full-featured software offerings at a very attractive price andgoing great guns after VAR and ISV commitments.andP;  Open Desktop is therealization of this target platfrom for this market SCO is counting on theproduct to open up the shrink-wrapped Unix desktop market, thus giving ISVs atarget market segment sufficiently large to be worth their attention.andM;Actually, SCO was somewhat surprised at the reception Open Desktop got, notfrom ISVS, who are very interested, but from the excitement generated fromcorporate MIS users.andP;  Among the initial orders for the Open Desktopdevelopment system (see Illustration 2) are a number of orders from Fortune500 companies, some of whom are ordering hundreds of systems.andP;  These MIStypes are planning to use Open Desktop as the target platform for in-houseend-user systems.andP;  Some, such as Harris Corporation, plan to use Open Desktopas a platform for system integration for their customers as well as forinternal applications (see box, page 14).andM;As Michels says,  We've got a little snowball rolling right now.andP;  Hopefully,it will become a big snowball.andP;  That is, if it doesn't rain.&quot;andM;ArchitectureandM;Open Desktop is not an application, but a collection of industry-standardhorizontal services that under Ueunix applications written to an Intel 386 or486 platform (see Illustration 1).andM;There are three versions of the Open Desktop family (see Illustration 2 on p.andO;5):andM;*  Open Desktop.andP;  The end-user product includes SCO Unix System V/386 Release3.2, Motif, a Desktop Manager, TCP/IP, NFS, LAN Manager Client, SQL RDBMSwith interactive SQL user services and Networked SQL, DOS 3.3, and DOS-Unixintegration services.andP;  A User's Guide and an Administrator's Guide areincluded.andM;*  The Open Desktop Server is a supplementary upgrade to the Open Desktopoperating system.andP;  The upgrade allows a 386 or 486 workstation to act as aserver for distributed client-server applications.andP;  The workstation can alsoact as a deserver for DOS, OS/2, Xenix, Unix, or Open Desktop networks.andP;  Theupgrade includes support for multiuser serial terminals, multiuser LANaccess, and X terminal, SQL, and PC-Interface.andP;  The basic Open Desktoppackage is required.andP;  Complete documentation is provided.andP;  The Open DesktopDevelopment System is a supplementary upgrade to the Open Desktop operatingsystem that provides standard APIs for the graphical interface, networking,database, and DOS-Unix integration services.andP;  The upgrade includesdevelopment-system versions of each Open Desktop component, interactivedebugging tools, and complete documentation.andP;  The basic Open Desktop packageis required.andM;SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS.andP;  Open Desktop runs on either a 386 or 486 system basedon ISA, EISA, or MCA.andP;  The minimum memory requirement is 6MB RAM and 100MBhard disk (see Illustration 3 on p. 6).andP;  Users must remember, though, thatthe minimum configuration will not be sufficient to run robust applications(e.g., Ingres, Uniplex, Alis, etc.) with any sort of reasonable performance.andO;The base system, a 386 with 6MB, will run Open Desktop and, say, a wordprocessor or spreadsheet.andM;Performance Issues.andP;  SCO is the first to admit that the current version ofOpen Desktop is slow in certain circumstances.andP;  Speed on a 25 Mandamp; machine wascompared to the lower end of the Sun line, about a Sun3.andP;  Though otherfactors play a part in performance, including I/O speed, graphics adapterspeed, memory, and application, in general, to achieve really zippyperformance, you need about a 33 KM system.andP;  Doug Michels doesn't feel that33 mHz is an outrageous expectation.andP;  &quot;Not too long from now, that will bethe minimum speed,&quot; he anticipates.andM;The performance seems especially slow compared to today's RISC machines,which are boosting users' standard expectations of performance.andM;But, Michels points out, you pick the price and performance you want.andP;  AndSCO has not finished optimizing performance.andP;  The new version of SCO Unix,due this month, promises to be much speedier.andP;  Similarly, both X.11 Release 4and Motif 2.0 will include significant performance improvements.andM;Still, one ISV we spoke to warned of the danger of seeing Open Desktop as aPC replacement, and, thus, buying N&quot; and memory as you would for a PC.andO;Rather, it is a workstation replacement, requiring the speed and the memorycommonly associated with that market.andM;User Interface and Desktop BehaviorandM;DESKTOP MANAGER.andP;  SCO has chosen to go with Motif as the Open Desktop lookand feel (see Illustration 4 on p. 7).andP;  But Open Desktop's graphicalwindowing environment, the Desktop Manager, based on X.desktop from IXI, goesbeyond the pure display capabilities of Motif, providing some managementcapabilities as well, including directory manipulation and online help.andM;Default Desktop.andP;  Each user has a default desktop that can be modified-newitems can be added and existing items can be returned to their originaldirectories (see Illustration 5 on p. 9).andP;  The objects on the default desktopinclude: Home directory, as assigned during installation.andP;  Unix Window, whichprovides a character-based window into the SCO Unix V/386 Release 3.2environment Multiple sessions in multiple windows can be supported.andP;  DOSwindow.andP;  Multiple DOS sessions in multiple windows may be accessed.andM;*  Xman.andP;  Xman is a manual browser that comes with the X toolkit.andP;  Theproduct lets you browse through online manuals.andP;  Root directory.andM;*  Help.andP;  Online help on Open Desktop functionality.andP;  Print, which isactivated through drag and drop.andP;  To print a file, drag it onto the printicon and release the mouse button.andP;  Trash, which is activated through dragand drop.andP;  To delete a file, you drag it onto the Trash icon and release themouse button.andP;  The left mouse button moves the file into the Trash directory.andO;The right button permanently deletes the file.andP;  Data access, which is accessinto Ingres.andP;  Other SCO Unix-based RDBMSs may also be accessed from theDesktop by assigning a data access icon to the executable DBMS file.andM;* Mail, which provides immediate access to Unix mail.andP;  Users can substitutetheir primary mail systems for the default mail system.andP;  Files to be sent viamail without a cover message can be dragged and dropped on the mail icon.andO;Customers can configure the mail system to use the word processor of choiceto compose messages.andP;  The word processor can be either Unix based or DOSbased.andP;  But if it is a DOS application, you need to include the conversionutility that is provided with the Open Desktop DOS integration functionalityto ensure that every mail recipient can read the message.andM;*  Editor.andP;  The default editor is vi, but the user can substitute any Unix orDOS editor by changing the editor variable in the profile file in each homedirectory.andM;* Sysadmsh, system administration shell, is actually part of SCO Unix.andP;  Theshell features ring menus for all common system administration tasks.andP;  Forexample, a new user can be added without having to access the /etc/passwdfile.andP;  The system administrator needs to understand his or her system, butdoesn't need to know Unix.andM;* Desktop Manager Menu.andP;  The Desktop Manager Menu provides access to windowfunctions including:andM;* Align, which aligns icons on an invisible gridandM;* Reorganize, which lines up icons at the top of the windowandM;* Select All, which selects all iconsandM;* Put Back, which returns any SeleCted icons to their original directoriesandM;* Icon Info, which disPlaYs information about selected icons and lets youchange file PermissiOnsandM;* Shell window, which opens a new Unix WindowandM;* Stop Desktop, which quits Open DesktopandM;Directory Menu.andP;  Each directory window has a Directory Menu, which acts onthe contents of that specific directory.andP;  Functions include:andM;* Displaying the directory contents in alphabetical order by the time eachfile or directory was created or modified, by class (directory files first,executable next, text and data last), or by size (smallest to largest)andM;* Selecting all files and directories in the windowandM;* Icon information, including setting file attributes such as read/writepermissionsandM;* Duplicating selected filesandM;* Creating a new directory within the current directoryandM;* Creating an empty fileandM;* Closing the directory window itselfandM;An icon is also provided for switching between an icon view of files anddirectories and a character view of the same directory.andP;  While the icon viewis preferable for manipulating files (dragging and  dropping), the charactermode takes up less room and allows more filenames to be displayed within thewindow.andM;BEHAVIOR.andP;  While the Open Desktop desktop has the standard Motif look,certain paradigms are the province of the Desktop Manager and can differ fromother Motif-based windowing systems.andM;Drag and Drop.andP;  The Desktop Manager supports the use of icons, using adrag-and-drop paradigm for icon manipulation.andP;  For example, to move a filefrom one directory to another, you simply drag the file icon from itsoriginal directory to the new directory and  op it there.andP;  Icon Creation.andP;  Apredefined set of standard icons is provided within Open Desktop.andP;  This is alimited set, so, for example, all executable files would have identicalicons.andP;  Alternate icons may be created or modified using bitmap, the(limited) X Window icon editor.andM;One particularly nice bit of icon usage is the symbol for a file to which youhave no access or permission:andM;This universally recognized ghostbuster-type symbol appeals to our sense ofwhimsy.andM;Click to Activate.andP;  Open Desktop supports the &quot;click to activate&quot; paradigm asthe default.andP;  This means that you must click within the window you wish toactivate.andP;  You can choose to configure the system with an alternative modecalled the  real estate&quot; method: Whatever window happens to contain the mousepointer (without clicking) is active; if you move your mouse accidentally,you find yourself positioned in some other window.andP;  (You can probably tellwhich method I prefer.andP;  But both paradigms have strong supporters.)andM;Mouse Usage.andP;  The product is designed for a two-button mouse, though athree-button mouse may be installed.andP;  In the three-button model, the middleand right buttons perform the same functions.andP;  Some programs are designed towork with three-button devices.andP;  While the two-button mice can access theapplications, some features may be unavailable.andP;  Two programs that come aspart of Open Desktop, Xman and Xterm (the UniX Window emulator), require athree-button mouse.andP;  For these programs only, using the Shift key plus theleft button emulates the middle button.andM;Open Desktop uses the &quot;double click (of the same mouse button) to execute&quot;paradigm.andP;  In general, the left button selects and the right button extends.andO;When you open an application or a directory, the left button creates a newwindow for the application; the right button substitutes the contents of thenew application into the active window.andM;While mouse-button conventions can be changed (for example, left-handed usersoften want to switch the function of the buttons), it isn't an end-user task.andO;One ISV commented, &quot;You have to really not like it to want to change it.&quot;andO;inconsistencies with Motif.andP;  Currently, the Desktop Manager is only &quot;Motif'd&quot;on the surface.andP;  The window 3-D shading and icons look like Motif, but menuoperations differ.andP;  The X.desktop interface features pop-up rather thanpull-down menus.andP;  This can be disconcerting.andP;  Even if all the applicationsrunning on your system sport Motif (though they do not have to), you go intoa very different paradigm when manipulating desktop windows and directories.andO;To further complicate matters, the Help feature sports yet another interface:ring menus, no scrollbars, no mouse support.andP;  And Xman features still onemore interface including a left scrollbar and a three-button mouse paradigm.andM;The next release of X.desktop will feature a complete Motif interface.andP;  OpenDesktop's Desktop Manager should get its Motif interface-lift soon after thenew release is completed.andM;The Open Desktop DatabaseandM;Currently, open Desktop comes complete with Version 6.1 of the Ingresrelational database system.andP;  Version 6.2 will be included in Open DesktopVersion 1.andP;  1 (due before the end of the year), and Version 6.3 of Ingreswill be part of Open Desktop Version 2.0 (due in 199 1).andP;  The rationalebehind using Ingres as the underlying relational database for Open Desktop ismore obvious from SCO's point of view than from Ingres's.andP;  SCO correctlyassumed that custom applications will be increasingly dependent on corporatedata.andP;  So the company sought a robust, distributed SQL DBMS that wouldaccommodate other databases, and Ingres fit the bill.andP;  Application tools werenot really an issue-which isn't to say that the Ingres toolset is not up tosnuff, because it is.andP;  The point is, however, that SCO doesn't want potentialcustomers hemming and hawing over whether or not to move to Open Desktopbecause they have standardized on a different database.andP;  Ingres is the onethat comes with the environment, but you can install whatever database youwant.andM;Open Desktop is advantageous for Ingres as well.andP;  The company has recentlygone public and is on a huge marketing blitz.andP;  Trying to emerge from itsimage as a good product that's shadowed by Oracle's marketing success, Ingresneeded a vehicle for market recognition.andP;  Enter open Desktop.andP;  If theplatform succeeds the way SCO hopes, Ingres would penetrate the market muchmore deeply than it could as a standalone product.andM;DATABASE TOOLS.andP;  Besides the back-end administrative facilities, Open Desktopprovides tools for developers and users.andP;  For developers:andM;* A module for embedding SQL statements, forms, menus, and other tools into ahost language program; access to embedded query languages, the visual formseditor, and a report writerandM;* A visual forms editorandM;* A report writerandM;For users:andM;* A menu-driven interface that ties together the database s systemsandM;* A forms package for queryingandM;* A forms-based report writerandM;* A more robust, command-driven report writerandM;* An interactive, forms-based SQL editorandM;DATABASE INTEGRATION.andP;  However, you don't necessarily need to be inside thedatabase module to perform certain operations, and you don't necessarily needto use the ingres database.andP;  Open Desktop has some on-the-fly data accessfacilities from a desktop window-or Data/Window-View, as it's referred to inOpen Desktop.andP;  Within Data/ Window View, you can PM in SQL commands, selectfields from a form, cut and paste text, run a report, and query by form.andO;These Motif-based, menu-driven facilities can access any Open Desktopdatabase or other database supported by an Ingres gateway.andM;NO ISV SUPPORT YET.andP;  Obviously, SCO doesn't want Ingres's involvement in OpenDesktop to stop other RDBMSs from writing to the environment.andP;  Therefore, SCOis stressing Open Desktop's relational capabilities instead of itsIngres-specific applications.andP;  Yet, none of the database companies we spokewith intends to write specifically to Open Desktop.andP;  Oracle, for example, has&quot;no plans whatsoever&quot; to write to OPen Desktop.andP;  We expected as much; oraclewouldn't be enthusiastic about playing on Ingres's back yard.andP;  Oracle doesn'tsupport Motif, so, at the moment, it couldn't run in the environment anyway.andO;Sybase, for another example, doesn't yet support either Motif or SCO Unix3.2.andP;  In most cases, it doesn't seem to be that other database companies arereluctant because of Ingres; it's just that they're technically unprepared tosupport Open Desktop any time in the near future.andP;  Either they don't yetsupport Motif or they don't support SCO Unix.andM;Access to DOS and Unix.andP;  Access to DOS is provided through Locus's Merge 386and PC-Interface server products.andP;  Multiple DOS windows may be open andactive simultaneously.andP;  All you have to do is double-click on the DOS icon inyour default desktop.andP;  You end up staring at the familiar DOS Candgt; prompt.andP;  Inaddition, DOS disks can be accessed.andP;  In fact, you can boot a DOS disk in anOpen Desktop window.andM;A native Unix Window is similarly accessed from the desktop.andP;  This takes youto the good old $ prompt.andP;  Any Unix application can be loaded through thiswindow.andP;  This is very significant; it means that you aren't limited to usingapplications written to the Open Desktop specifications.andP;  As long as theapplication is written to SCO Unix System V/386 Release 3.2, the applicationwill run.andM;Networking ProtocolsandM;Open Desktop uses TCP/IP transport and comes complete with NFS and LANManager client software, allowing connectivity to standard Unix and OS/2 andDOS networks, as well as any proprietary network that supports either NFS orLAN Manager.andP;  The product supports both Ethernet and Token-Ring networks.andM;In the next release, NFS server capability will be included in the baseoffering of Open Desktop, so each workstation or PC on the network can accessfiles distributed across other Open Desktop machines on the network.andP;  SCO hasnot yet determined which protocol to support for remote computing.andO;Basically, the company is waiting to see what emerges as the de factostandard.andP;  Our guess is that Open Desktop will incorporate whatever remotecomputing protocol is chosen by OSF.andM;Similarly, no networking services, such as authentication, security, timeservices, etc., are part of the product.andP;  This area is under investigation.&quot;andO;Again, SCO is waiting for a clear standard to emerge.andM;Finally, in the area of network management, SCO is again playing the waitinggame.andP;  But the company does plan to offer a graphical front end to whatevernetwork management system is offered.andP;  Network management, when available,will be included in the Server Upgrade version of Open Desktop, most likelyin the next release.andM;Open Desktop ComponentsandM;We asked why the current suite of products was chosen to make up the OpenDesktop platform.andP;  Doug Michels explained that there were severalconsiderations.andP;  First, the components had to be consistent with emergingstandards.andP;  Because it was in contact with most of the players in theindustry, SCO could choose those products that it felt best met the demandsof the industry.andP;  But another major consideration was reputation of thecompany and prior relationships with SCO.andP;  Michels admits that, in somecases, there might be better products out there in some areas, but heconsiders this to be a short term advantage.andP;  Open Desktop is a long-termstrategic product.andP;  Thus, the kind of company, the pricing, and thecommitment to Open Desktop were important factors in the decision.andP;  Thecompanies which are providing the components are all committed to &quot;workingtogether in the long term to syncronize the evolution of Open Desktop,&quot;according to Michels.andM;OPEN DESKTOP COMPLIANCE NOT NEEDED.andP;  If you would prefer to use few or noneof the Open Desktop services, you can choose to bypass applications in theinstallation process.andP;  For example, you can bypass the data service (Ingres)installation in favor of using Oracle.andM;And Oracle doesn't need to be written to Open Desktop to function properly.andO;As long as it's written to SCO Unix, it win operate fine in the Open Desktopenvironment.andP;  If the database manager is also written to Motif, it will looklike the rest of the environment, but it won't change the functionality ofthe application within the environment.andP;  The advantages to specificallywriting to Open Desktop are more marketing-the ability to promote an OpenDesktop version-and the installation considerations.andP;  With Open Desktop, arange of services are installed.andP;  Open Desktop-compliant applications assumethat these services exist, and the user doesn't have to specifically tell theapplication about them.andM;Using Open DesktopandM;THE INSTALLATION PROCESS.andP;  Open Desktop is not intended to be installed bycasual end users.andP;  It is, after all, a Unix product, and the multitasking,multiuser nature of Unix still requires system administration, much as theworkstation market does.andP;  To that end, SCO is requiring that all VARs andOpen Desktop distributors (and their resellers) preinstall the system andship it fully loaded.andP;  SCO has strict requirements in training andinstallation for their resellers to ensure that the customer gets a fullyloaded system that will be up and running quickly and effectively.andM;For those customers who don't buy through a distributor, the installationprocess is geared more for the nontechnical administrator instead of the Unixgroupie.andM;Instructions are very clear, though not graphical.andP;  The process looks toomuch like Unix for our taste.andP;  There is one point where the interface changesand you are presented with a menu screen for installing the VGA monitor.andO;This, we were told, is the interface for SCO's own applications.andP;  It would benice if the entire process worked with these nicely designed, thoughcharacter-based, menus.andP;  But, even as it is now, the process isstraightforward.andP;  In fact, with a list of device names for the installation,even a novice ran handle it.andM;On the other hand, the installation process uses well over 40 diskettes, anumber of which are reused several times.andP;  It takes hours of swappingfloppies to get Open Desktop up and running.andP;  An installation tape isavailable, but, for tapeless systems, be prepared to shufile diskettes.andM;Our solution to the installation blues is bundling agreement with PC vendors.andO;Then, when I buy my 386, Open Desktop is already installed.andP;  All I have to dois indicate which devices are specific to my network (by menu, of course).andO;SCO would not commit to any specific bundling agreements, but we suspectseveral are already in the works.andM;SCO is also working on providing a CD-ROM-based installation.andM;WORKING IN THE ENVIRONMENT.andP;  As mentioned earlier (see &quot;Inconsistencies withMotif&quot; page 9), you run into inconsistent behavior in the desktop managerwhen you go past the top level.andP;  The different interface paradigm, however,isn't difficult to master, and it actually works pretty well with Motif.andM;The interface within the applications is left totally to the applicationitself, though Open Desktop-compliant programs are Motif based.andP;  This meansthat they most likely will follow the Motif style guide in designing theirinterface.andP;  (Incidentally, the Motif style guide is the same as thePresentation Manager style guide.) We had no difficulty opening severalapplications within multiple windows, nor moving between them.andP;  Someapplications were easier to use than others, but that's because of thecomplexity of the software, not the environment.andM;Opening multiple DOS and Unix sessions is very simple.andP;  There is the shock ofmoving into the character-based world, but, at least in DOS, you could gointo Windows, which operates much like Motif.andM;Single-Source Documentation.andP;  One of the selling points of Open Desktop isthe user documentation.andP;  Though not all the services operate in the samemanner, SCO provides a single set of documentation, written in a singlestyle, for all components of the environment.andP;  This can be a big advantage tousers because they don't have to keep switching from one style of referencematerial to another.andP;  SCO states that its documentation brings  Unix to theuser.&quot;andM;Interoperability.andP;  A big advantage to working within a predefined environmentis the interoperability between applications.andP;  For example, Windows and PMhave DDE links; the NU environment has cut-and-paste buffers as well asMacroMaker, a low-end, cross-application macro facility; NewWave has, or willshortly have, agents and hot links between applications.andP;  Unfortunately, atthis time, Open Desktop does not offer any additional functionality on thisscore other than the cut-and-paste capability found in X Window.andP;  This can bereasonably functional, though.andP;  Because both DOS and non-Open Desktop Unixapplications are opened in X Windows, contents of these applications can becut and pasted with each other and with Open Desktop applications.andM;However, we would like to see SCO focus on providing this sort ofinteroperability.andP;  It would allow the platform to truly add value, ratherthan simply being a target design center.andM;ISV Issues.andP;  For two years now, Open Desktop has been the talk of UniForum.andO;In 1989, SCO joined with Digital Equipment Corporation, Locus ComputingCorporation, Relational Technology Incorporated, and Tandy Corporation toannounce the concept behind the product and the timetable for availability.andO;Then, this January, the SCO booth was buzzing with activity as the product,complete with Beta versions of Open Desktop applications, was demonstrated.andO;The number of applications actually running was disappointing.andP;  SCO hadinitially hoped to have about 30 applications to show off.andP;  In fact, 17applications were presented, but only a handful were actual alive andworking.andP;  Most were canned demos.andP;  We were assured by both SCO and ISVs thatthis was not due to problems with the developer's toolkit.andP;  SCO hadunderestimated the difficulty of creating a stable desktop Unix environment.andO;As Doug Michels said, &quot;It was hard!&quot; And SCO was determined to do itright-all the pieces working together seamlessly andtransparently-understanding that if it wasn't done well, no one would writeto it.andP;  So delays resulted.andP;  The original timetable called for Open Desktopto be available to developers in April of 1989 and to customers in the thirdquarter of the same year.andP;  In actuality, developers didn't get the fulltoolkit until September  89 (though prerelease versions were available sinceApril  89), and the retail version wasn't available until January of thisyear.andP;  But now the news is much better.andP;  Many applications are currently inBeta with scheduled ship dates (SCO would not give us a specific--or even aballpark--number), and, in general, ISVs are happy with the quality andstability of the Open Desktop toolkit.andM;OPENDESKTOP TOOLKIT.andP;  SCO has riot written new APIs to the standard serviceswhich make up Open Desktop.andP;  But the Open Desktop Toolkit does include itsown documentation, which Allen Ginzburg, director of strategic marketing atSCO, states has &quot;cleaned up&quot; a lot of the instructions for those APIs.andM;In addition to the APIs for Motif, X lib, Ingres, TCP/IP, and NFS, OpenDesktop provides Locus's PC Interface Library.andP;  This is a DOS library whichgenerates DOS and OS/2 binaries and lets you write DOS programs that use bothDOS and Unix facilities both locally and over a network.andM;ISV ENDORSEMENTS.andP;  We spoke to a number of ISVs, asking them why they choseto endorse the Open Desktop platform.andP;  All the developers we interviewed saidthe same things: Grateful for a Target.andP;  The positioning of Open Desktop as atarget platform for desktop Unix is supported by the ISV community.andP;  Ibis isthe way Unix-based window applications will finally move through commercialdistribution channels.andP;  Open Desktop is the next vital step on the road toshrink-wrapped Unix,&quot; states Larry Warnock, director of marketing at Uniplex.andO;He continues, &quot;An unbundled solution can be really complicated for the user.andO;Open Desktop takes care of all those installation problems.&quot; Uniplex is inBeta testing with its Open Desktop version of the UnipleX Windows OfficeSystem.andM;Chris Knudsen, vice president of marketing at CrossWind Technologies,concurs, and adds,  &quot;Products like SCO's Open Desktop straddle the Unix andPC markets.andP;  The lines between the two platforms are becoming fuzzy.&quot;andO;CrossWind is about to ship its Open Desktop version of the Synchronizemultiuser time management tool.andM;The hardware vendors are equally pleased with a target platform.andP;  Accordingto Kenneth Osowski, director of Unix systems product management at Wang,&quot;Open Desktop brings standards to the market.andP;  And this is a big help,because picking a Unix software platform can be very confusing.' Osowski seesPCs running Open Desktop as a major step in the success of the businessmarket for Unix.andP;  Wang will support Open Desktop on its PC 300 series, whereit can run as a single-user system or as a multiuser server.andP;  Open Desktopwill also be supported on the Wang OpenServer line.andM;Riding SCO's Coattails.andP;  One major factor in the decision to endorse OpenDesktop seems to come not from an industry need, but from a strategicpartnering decision.andP;  Developers seem unanimous in their endorsement of SCOas the star to which they want to hitch their Unix wagons.andP;  Jim Morton,Applix's product manager of 386 Alis, is clearly a fan.andP;  &quot;SCO has establisheditself as the 386 Unix supplier, wiping out an the competition.andP;  SCO has theclout to take Unix into the office for the average mortal person.&quot; The OpenDesktop version of Alis was about to be shipped as we went to press.andM;Wang's Osowski says, &quot;Look at SCO's track record.andP;  Its commitment [to desktopUnix] will be a big push for Unix business software.&quot;andM;Realistically,&quot; Uniplex's Warnock points out, &quot;SCO has a large industrypresence and marketing channel.andP;  But it needs applications.andP;  And applicationsneed distribution.andP;  It works out well for both sides.&quot;andM;And SCO has just bitten off an even bigger piece of the Unix operating systempie by acquiring HCR Corporation, a Toronto-based concern that is reported tobe the leading Unix software company in Canada.andP;  SCO Canada, Inc., as theindependent subsidiary will be cared, will provide programming tools underOpen Desktop, as well as supplying consulting and contractual services.andM;Other Motivaters for Endorsement.andP;  There were a variety of other reasonsgiven for Open Desktop development, including the following:andM;* Low-cost platform for X Window.andP;  Applix's Morton comments, &quot;Open Desktop isa great low-cost platform for our product and for other X-basedapplications.&quot;andM;* Alternative to OS/2.andP;  When SCO first announced Open Desktop, we saw it as asolution alternative to OS/2.andP;  Multitasking, but a lot more stable and maturethan OS/2,&quot; comments Warnock from Uniplex.andP;  &quot;Also, SCO is selling OpenDesktop through the reseller channel where customers can get a turnkeysolution.andP;  That's really what desktop users want.&quot;andM;* Alliance with Microsoft.andP;  Morton finds SCO's alliance with Microsoft(Microsoft owns 10 percent of SCO) attractive.andM;&quot;The migration from the DOS world will be easier as a result of the alliancebetween SCO and Microsoft.&quot;andM;ISV CONCERNS.andP;  While most of the ISVs are optimistic about Open Desktop'spotential, a few concerns were expressed.andP;  Unrealistic Expectations.andP;  Themajor concern voiced was the fear that users would have unrealisticexpectations regarding platform architecture and performance.andP;  While SCO Unixis very fast, X and Motif slow it down a lot,&quot; mentions one ISV.andP;  &quot;Users haveto understand that you can't use a really cheap configuration and runworkstation-type applications.&quot;andM;Another stresses that the Open Desktop and SCO Unix product should &quot;do wellfor where it is targeted-at the workstation product level.andP;  It is not meantto replace 386 Xenix running an eight-user, character-based accountingsystem.&quot;andM;Still another stated, &quot;Customers and retailers need to understand that OpenDesktop is a workstation product complete with networking.andP;  If people don'tneed workstation capabilities, then don't buy Open Desktop.&quot;andM;Most feel that the danger is customers getting attracted to the low price ofa minimal configuration-386, 6MB, 100MB disk-without realizing that robustX-based applications will not perform weB.andP;  In addition, there are problemsof real estate on a screen.andP;  The marketing director of one software vendorcomments,  X costs you two inches, one at the top of the screen and one atthe bottom.andP;  So, to realistically run most Motif applications, you need to gofor a larger, high-resolution monitor.andP;  Then you need to load your 386 with awhole lot of memory and processor speed-20 WHz is rock bottom.andP;  For fourusers, you have to plan on 33 NM.andP;  Once you pay for all this, you've lostyour price/performance advantage.andP;  You're in the same cost ballpark as aSPARCStation 1.&quot;andM;&quot;People are going to be disappointed if they look for too much of a bargain,&quot;one ISV summed up.andM;Competition from RISC.andP;  Several comments were made about the competition fromRISC platforms, which will continue to go down in cost, improving theprice/performance ratio vis a vis the 386 and 486 platforms.andM;SCO, while not committing to any specific plans for migration to RISC, hasstated that it is committed to the Intel product line and that it will mostlikely move in the direction of Intel's i860 RISC platform.andP;  However, SCOalso said that it plans to stay in sync with the market.andP;  We anticipate thatthe company may have to move off an exclusive Intel platform and embrace theMotorola 88K or MIPS RISC platform if SCO does want to keep in line with themarketplace.andM;Slow ISV Development.andP;  A few of the ISVs we interviewed expressed concern atthe slow development pace for third-party Open Desktop applications.andP;  &quot;Unlessthere is a flurry of applications, Open Desktop will go nowhere,&quot; one vendorremarked.andM;But others were very optimistic for the same reason.andP;  &quot;SCO has a vestedinterest in working with ISVS.andP;  No ISV support, no applications.andP;  So supportfrom SCO has been excellent.&quot; System Stability.andP;  We did hear one verynegative reaction from an ISV who claimed that the Open Desktop software wasvery buggy.andP;  &quot;Oh, sure, we're going to write for it, but, around here, wecall the  product 'Open Deathtrap!'&quot; Packaging.andP;  Finally, one ISV pointed outthe problem in packaging a shrink-wrapped Open Desktop application.andP;  &quot;It'snot like DOS, where you take it out of the box and run it.andP;  You have to makean attractive and clear package that will move through the distributionchannel.andP;  But how do you make clear the difference between a 16- and a32-user system, for example? There are a lot more packaging issues that weneed to resolve.&quot;andM;Marketing StrategyandM;SEEDING THE MARKET.andP;  Open Desktop is not really ready for prime-time retailsales to end users.andP;  SCO admits this.andP;  But the company felt strongly that astable, usable version for developers needed to come out quickly to seed themarket.andP;  Waiting too long could result in some competitor stealing the marketor in the window of opportunity closing because no applications were ready.andO;However, SCO did postpone release of the product to make sure it was, indeedstable, if not polished.andP;  &quot;You can seed the market or you can poison it,&quot;said Doug Michels.andP;  MARKET THRUST.andP;  SCO does not consider ISVs as a majorrevenue target for Open Desktop.andP;  Though early developers paid for thesystem, Michels acknowledges that this charge was necessary to cover the highcosts of suPPOrting and updating early development systems, and, now thatmoney is coming in from customers, the company can afford to be more generouswith ISVS.andP;  ISVs are part of the infrastructure of the market We need them,&quot;commented Michels.andM;There are two initial marketing thrusts for Open Desktop: large corporatecustomers and the workstation market.andP;  Corporate customers are buyingmultiple copies of the development system and are designing customapplications.andP;  The end-user versions will go on the users' desks as soon asthese in-house applications are ready.andM;The workstation user is accustomed to paying premium prices and is ready-madefor a lower cost platform,&quot; says Michels.andP;  And this user's expectations arenot as high as those of PC or Macintosh users.andP;  Thus, workstations userswon't be put off by the inconsistencies in the current version of OpenDesktop.andP;  However, he does riot view this as a long-term market.andP;  The DOS PCmarket has a lot more potential in size and revenue.andP;  Retail Is the Goal.andO;Ultimately, the target customer for Open Desktop is the retail shopper.andP;  ButMichels doesn't anticipate much movement in this market until over a yearout.andP;  When applications are ready, the target machines are out, and the nextlevel of polish and distribution support is there, then we can address theretail customer.andP;  The PC, Mac, OS/2 level of user.&quot; Pricing.andP;  Whether or notyou approve of the concept of Open Desktop, you have to like its price tag.andO;For $995, you get almost $5,000 worth of software.andP;  The actual pricebreakdown of afl the Open Desktop services looks like this:andM;* SCO Unix - $595andM;* Ingres version 6.1 -  1,495andM;* X.desktop, including X Windows and Motif - $395andM;* TCP/E? - $595andM;* NFS - $595andM;* LAN Manager - No price givenandM;* DOS Merge, including DOS 3.3 - $495andM;Open Desktop is priced to sell.andP;  Ingres, reportedly, practically gave awaythe software to be included in SCO's product.andP;  Obviously, the vendorsinvolved have great confidence in the future of Open Desktop and in itspotential for opening new markets for them.andM;FuturesandM;Though SCO has not yet announced what will go into the next release of OpenDesktop, Mike Foster, Open Desktop marketing manager, states that the nextversion of the product will concentrate on three areas: userinterface-specifically, enhancements to the help and system administrationfunction, as well as complete Motif implementation; integration-betterintegration of the links between the components of Open Desktop; andperformance optimization.andM;With the problems of inconsistency addressed, SCO needs to focus on issues ofinteraction and interoperability-some sort of data exchange mechanism such asWindows' and PM's DDE is necessary.andM;SCO needs to look at what value Open Desktop can add as an environment and tothe applications written to the environment; cross-application macros are agood example.andP;  After all, the problem of adding value is usually limitedbecause not all applications are written to the same platform and protocols.andO;Open Desktop applications are, and that is the primary function of theproduct--being a common platform.andM;But users must realize that Open Desktop does not, at this point, addanything to the applications themselves.andP;  There is no interoperability abovewhat comes standard in X Window; the behavior and look and feel ofapplications are no more consistent than any nominally written to Motif (fullMotif implementations will have a higher degree of consistency).andP;  Rather, theplatform provides all the underpinnings necessary for a multitasking,networked, graphical environment.andP;  Writing to Open Desktop eliminates manyinstallation hardships for users and, even more significantly, establishes ade facto standard for a Unix desktop platform.andM;Open Desktop in the Real WorldandM;HAVING ANTICIPATED primary support from the ISV and reseller communities, SCOhas been somewhat surprised by the enthusiastic response to Open Desktop fromthe corporate world.andP;  Though SCO would not provide a list of corporatecustomers, it did provide a few names and stories.andM;Harris CorporationandM;Harris Corporation, a worldwide electronics and communications company findsthat Open Desktop addresses its d= requirements for an advanced operatingsystem platform:andM;* Flexibility and powerful tools required to keep ahead of theandM;competitionandM;* The ability to merge dig= operating systems, communications protocols, andhardware platformsandM;* The ability to downsize systems from mainframes and minis to networkedworkstationsandM;The integration of de facto standards was also a big selling point forHarris.andM;Harris plans to use Open Desktop to develop internal mission-criticalsystems, though no specific applications were mentioned.andP;  Open Desktop willalso be used for systems integration for Harris customers and for developmentof commercial software such as a network management system.andM;Eastman ChristensenandM;Eastman Christensen is an oil-field service company which is planning to useOpen Desktop on GRiDCASE 1530 Laptops to direct offshore drilling activitiesaround the world.andP;  Realtime decisions will be made based on tracking the pathtaken to reach a target drill site.andP;  Open Desktop's graphical user interfacewill be used to depict the path of each well in U&quot; dimensional geographicalcoordinates, and the relational database functionality will store therelevant drilling parameters for dynamic and static analysis.andP;  EastmanChristensen had considered developing its own system by linking a workstationcomputation engine, relational database, TCP/IP, and X Window environment,but the time and work required was daunting.andP;  Open Desktop, which combinesall the required services, nicely fits dc bill.andM;The Right CombinationandM;In both cases, Open Desktop was chosen because it offered the rightcombination of standards at a low cost.andP;  Both companies plan to use OpenDesktop as an internal development platform for mission-criticalapplications.andP;  And, in both cases, the companies would probably have puttogether a similar platform based on standards, but at considerable cost andeffort.andP;  SCO made it much easier for them to get to the business of runningthe business.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
