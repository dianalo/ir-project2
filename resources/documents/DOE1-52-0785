This is achieved by changing the surface properties of the pyritefrom aerophilic to aerophobic. Pyrite particles of various sizes canbe suppressed with an efficiency of over 92% providing sufficient bacterialcells are present. The paper describes the effect of bacteria on sulphursuppression of both synthetic coal mixtures and a high sulphur Americancoal. 20 refs., 4 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
