Try a Chinese evergreen (aglaonema commutatum), which toleratesdry air and temperatures ranging from 85 degrees to 60 degrees orlower and does well in low light. Water this plant when the soilsurface feels dry to keep the roots moist but not drenched.</TEXT><TEXT>   Your houseplant ferns turn brown and dry. What's the problem?   Ferns often are challenging to grow in the house because theyusually prefer cool temperatures (a maximum of about 72 degrees inthe daytime), indirect light, moist soil and humid air.   Browning and drying of frond tips and yellowing and drooping ofinterior leaves usually mean that the air is too dry. Place ferns inan area of the house that is naturally more humid, such as thekitchen, bathroom or laundry room. Or place plants in trays of wetgravel and use a room humidifier to add moisture to the air. Thehumidifier may help your comfort, too.</TEXT><TEXT>   Vegetable spaghetti can be used the same way as the pasta. It's ahard-shelled squash with spaghetti-like pulp.   Grow it like any other garden squash, harvesting it when theshell is hard. To prepare, scoop out the pulp and cook in boilingwater, or boil the squash whole first and scoop it out after. Servewith your favorite spaghetti sauce.</TEXT><TEXT>   Intelligent neglect is what cactus plants need in winter. Cactiare essentially dormant then and susceptible to overwatering. Keepthem in a cool area _ 40-45 degrees _ and water monthly. Don't feedthem, either. Watering and fertilizing them may make them rot.</TEXT><TEXT>   If houseplants on windowsills develop black blotches on leavesand some become droopy, it could be cold injury. Many of theseplants originated in the tropics and can easily be damaged easily bylow or freezing temperatures.   Leaves that touch cold window glass in winter may freeze and turnblack, especially if closed drapes or blinds deprive the plant ofheated air in the room.   A remedy is to increase light levels for plants by grouping themunder fluorescent lamps rather than crowding them against coldwindows.</TEXT><TEXT>   If your garden is shady, try growing leafy crops such as lettuceand other salad greens. They will grow in partial shade, with two orthree hours of sun daily, less than the six to eight hours needed byother vegetables. Also try endive, spinach, parsley and tarragon.</TEXT><TEXT>   Remove and discard diseased plants and plant parts through springand summer. Check tulips, peonies, gladiolus and iris especially.Destroy tulip leaves when they die. Start proper fungicide spray atthe first sign of disease.</TEXT><TEXT>   If your garden is very small, stake tomato plants. Remove thesuckers, which grow in the angle made by the leaf stem and the mainstem, and tie the plants to tall stakes as they grow. Tie weekly forbest support.</TEXT><TEXT>   Want to make some gourmet herb vinegar? Organic Gardeningmagazine says it's easy with white or cider vinegar and fresh-pickedgarden herbs.   Thyme, basil, marjoram, tarragon, rosemary, fennel, chervil, dillor mint are good choices.   Put about a cup of fresh herbs, chopped coarsely, and two orthree cups of vinegar in a clear jar or bottle. Cap the jar and seton a sunny windowsill for about two weeks to let flavors mellow.Then strain the vinegar into a clean jar and insert a fresh herbstalk for easy identification and an attractive appearance.</TEXT><TEXT>   Cynoglossum, also known as Chinese forget-me-not, is an annualthat will reproduce itself in any corner of the yard or garden ifthe seeds are not removed. If you don't want to weed it out in thespring, cut back the bloom stalks before the seeds ripen.   Impatiens (also called sultana) is not winter hardy, but you canpot it and take it indoors before frost. It makes a nice house plantbut requires a sunny place indoors for blooming.</TEXT><TEXT>   Cut sprays of parsley and sage and spread them on a piece ofpaper over a wire rack. Set the rack in a shaded, airy place, and inabout 10 days the sprays will dry. Then strip the leaves from thestem, crumple them until they are fine, and store in a glass jar foruse as seasoning during winter months.</TEXT><TEXT>   If your family enjoys greens, plant Swiss chard. It's a heavyproducer, and both leaves and stalks can be used. You can cook thegreen leaves as you would spinach or use them as salad greens. Thestripped stalks can be cooked alone like celery.</TEXT><TEXT>   Parsley is easier to start indoors in a plant starter becauseseeds take three weeks or so to sprout.</TEXT></DOC>
