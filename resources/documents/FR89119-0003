Onceapproved by the respective government aviation authorities, as requiredunder bilateral agreements and/or the Act, these tariffs become legallybinding contracts of carriage for international air transportation. The airlines currently file tariffs on paper in accordance with the requirementscontained in 14 CFR Part 221 of the Department's regulations. These requirementshave remained essentially the same since their inception in 1938, whenthe former Civil Aeronautics Board (the ``Board'') was established. Now,half a century later, carriers and their tariff publishing agents are stillsubmitting all proposed fares, rates, and rules on paper, and DOT analystsare still searching through voluminous paper documents to evaluate allproposed tariffs. This paper system worked well in a regulatory environment when tariffswere more stable and static. However, the aviation environment has changeddramatically in the last ten years. U.S. domestic air transportation hasbeen completely deregulated and the international aviation marketplacehas become increasingly more competitive. Carrier fares, rules, and ratesare now subject to frequent, sometimes daily, changes. As a result, thevolume of tariff pages filed has increased tremendously, creating a burdenon the Department, the industry and the public that has become virtuallyunmanageable and unworkable. By the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking issued July 8, 1988 (53 FR 25615)(NPRM), we announced a proposal designed to provide near-term, interimrelief. We proposed to allow any carrier or its tariff filing agent (the``filer''), to file its passenger fares electronically with the Departmentby establishing and maintaining a database of all such fares, subject tocertain conditions imposed by the Department. The public would have accessto this data through terminals installed by the filer and located at Departmentalheadquarters, and at no charge. The Department would record its decisionsregarding these fare filings into this database. All daily data transactions and Department decisions would be recordedon an electronic storage device at Departmental headquarters. This wouldconstitute the ``Official DOT tariff database''. All Departmental actionswould also appear in the ``on-line tariff database'' maintained by thefiler.\1\<NOTE/> At the end of each day, each filer would submit to the Departmentan electronic copy of all transactions made during that day for comparisonwith the daily data transaction record. We would compare the daily electroniccopy furnished by the filer with the copy of the daily transactions thatwe recorded on our computer to ensure that the records, particularly theon-line databases, were complete and accurate. If they were not, we wouldtake steps to ensure immediate corrective action. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The term ``on-line tariff database'' means the remotelyaccessible, on-line version, maintained by the filer, of (1) the electronicallyfiled tariff data submitted to the ``official DOT tariff database,'' and(2) the Departmental approvals, disapprovals and other actions, as wellas Departmental notations concerning such approvals, disapprovals or otheractions, that Subpart W of the proposed Part 221 requires the filer tomaintain in its database. The term ``official DOT tariff database'' meansthose data records (as set forth in andSection;andSection; 221.283 and 221.286of the rule) which would be in the custody of, and maintained by, the Departmentof Transportation. Electronic filing would be strictly optional. The paper system would remainavailable to those carriers or filing agents still wishing to use it. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments </ITAG>We received comments on our proposal from Airline Tariff Publishing Company(ATPCO), Air Transport Association of America (ATA), ABC International(ABC), American Airlines, Inc. (American), Eastern Air Lines, Inc. (Eastern),The Flying Tiger Line Inc. (Flying Tiger), USAir, Inc. jointly with PiedmontAviation, Inc., (USAir/Piedmont), Venturi Associates, the Information IndustryAssociation (IIA), and KLM Royal Dutch Airlines (KLM).\2\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ KLM accompanied its submission with a motion for leaveto file out of time. We will grant KLM's motion. All of the commenters support the adoption of the proposed rule. Each,however, suggests certain modifications or clarifications. Most of thesuggested changes are purely technical, going to refinements or improvementsbased upon the commenter's own experience with computer technology andprogramming. Some of the suggested changes are more substantive in character,going to policy issues directly related to the rule itself. In the summarybelow, and in the discussion section which follows, we shall address thesesubstantive matters first. Substantive Comments ATPCO, supported by American, Eastern, Flying Tiger, KLM, USAir/Piedmont,and ATA, recommends that the proposed rule be expanded to incorporate alltariffs, rather than being limited just to passenger tariffs. It objectsto the imposition of the electronic filing fee, alleging that the proposedrule contained no cost justification for the fee. Moreover, it argues thatno electronic filing fee should be assessed on those existing records whichare converted from the paper to the electronic medium upon the implementationof filing official tariffs electronically. ABC requests that the rule be amended to require that the Department orthe filer make the ``raw tariff data'' \3\<NOTE/> available to any user or any other interested person on areasonable, non-discriminatory basis keyed to added cost. They proposethat this be done by any of the following methods: remote computer link,daily transmissions, or on a machine-readable tape. ABC also requests thatthe rule be amended to clearly define the term ``remote access''. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The term ``raw tariff data'', as a practical matter, meansencoded machine-readable computer data, normally in a binary format, whichmay be transmitted to a user in a magnetic or other medium. This machine-readabledata then can be read electronically by another computer with the requisitesoftware without any human interpretation. Once the data is read by theother computer it will convert such data into letters and numbers whichmay then be read by an individual. IAA recommends that daily tariff data should be consolidated onto a singlestorage medium (such as magnetic tape or CD-ROM \4\<NOTE/> ) and be made available to the public and private sectorusers who may wish such data. IIA also seeks clarification on which party,the Government or the private entity, would be liable for the accuracyand integrity of the information contained in the filer's on-line tariffdatabase. Finally, IIA recommends that an expiration date be placed onthe rule, or in the absence of an expiration date, that the rule includeone or more milestones marking points at which the interim solution willbe reviewed by senior Departmental officials.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The abbreviation ``CD-ROM'' means a compact optical disk,read-only, which contains encoded machine-readable tariff data, normallyin a binary format, which may be interpreted by a computer and convertedinto letters and numbers.Technical CommentsATPCO, supported by American, Eastern, Flying Tiger, KLM, USAir/Piedmontand ATA, (a) objects to those requirements that would require the filerto provide on-line access to the tariff database 24 hours per day, 7 daysper week; (b) objects to the requirement that, in the event of failure,the primary dedicated circuit be restored in 4 hours; (c) seeks clarificationon the data fields that are to be made available to the Government andon the size of the fields; (d) objects to the requirement for inclusionof the ``tariff number'' in the Filing Advice Status File; (e) objectsto those provisions of andSection; 221.283(b)(7)(ii) which would precludethe providing of reasons for Departmental action; (f) seeks clarificationof the ``routing'' as used in andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(viii) and 283.283(c)(8);(g) objects to the requirement of specifying a ``discontinue date'' asset forth in andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(ix); (h) objects to the requirementfor the specification of unique rule numbers as proposed andSection; 221.284;(i) objects to annotating the fare records in the name of the former carrierwhen such carrier is adopted by another carrier; (j) recommends that thedouble filing of paper associated with Special Tariff Permission Applicationsbe modified to require that the paper page be filed only once; (k) seeksclarification of the statement in Section 221.500 that the paper tariffwould be considered the ``official tariff'' during the 90 day experimentalperiod; (l) recommends that, during the experimental period under andSection;221.500, filers be permitted to file only selected fares; (m) recommendsthat the rule be amended to allow the filer to assess the public a chargefor copies made from a filer's printer in the Department's Public ReferenceRoom.Venturi Associates recommends that any user fees established by any filerfor its services at Departmental Headquarters not be cost prohibitive.IIA recommends that: (a) The Department consolidate the information submittedby each filer into a single data feed at Departmental Headquarters foreasier access by the user, and (b) the Department consider making all theelectronic tariff data available through a single terminal located in theDepartment's Public Tariff Reference Room.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion and Disposition of Comments_Substantive Issues_</ITAG>Scope of RuleWe have decided not to expand the rule beyond the passenger fare tariffscope that ATPCO recommended in its petition and that we tentatively adoptedin our NPRM. As we said in the NPRM, ``our simple objective here is toprovide some measure of interim relief to the Department and to the industryfrom the burdens of filing paper tariffs.'' (53 FR 25616.) We regard thegeneral industry support for, and complete absence of opposition to, theNPRM, as indicative of a widespread recognition that our rule would indeedmeet this objective. This is not to say that we lack sympathy for the commenters'wish that we move farther faster. However, before acting on ATPCO's petition,we fully explored all the options available to us and weighed the costsand benefits of those options. We determined that we could not reconcilean expansion of the rule beyond passenger fare tariffs with our perceivedneed for, and thus our urgent desire for, prompt, interim relief. Thatis still our view. Given the additional and more complex technical questionssure to arise with any proposed expansion, our limited resources to addressthose questions, and the time that would inevitably be expended in theprocess, we have concluded that the public interest would be much betterserved by retaining the present scope of the rule.In this connection, we are mindful of the concern expressed by some commentersthat we might simply stop at this interim step and never complete the electronificationprocess. Decidely that is not our intent. We made clear in the NPRM thateven as we moved towards providing interim relief, our longer-term automationefforts were continuing. If anything, these efforts should be enhancedand speeded by the experience we gain under the interim approach. The complexityof the process and the difficulty of predicting precisely when certainbreakthroughs can be achieved dissuaded us from adopting a specific deadlineor even fixed milestones, as has been suggested. Nevertheless, we repeatand reemphasize what we said in the NPRM, namely, that we are not departingfrom our ultimate goal of establishing a fully integrated electronic tariffsystem. 53 FR 25616.Filing FeesWe shall maintain the proposed level of filing fees. In the NPRM (53 FR25620), we described the cost methodology we employed in setting the intermfiling fees. We cited two studies we relied upon, <T3>Tariffs Computerization Project-Feasibility Study and Cost AnalysisReport (June 1985) </T3>and <T3>Preliminary Electronic Tariff ADP Requirements Study (March 1987).</T3>We also indicated that we were deriving labor cost estimates fromexisting labor costs. We specifically adhered to the fee development guidelinesas set forth in applicable organizational regulations, OR-204, effectiveJanuary 10, 1983, Dockets 30586 and 30816 (48 FR 635, January 6, 1983.\5\<NOTE/> These guidelines provide that:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ These were formerly the organizational regulations ofthe Board and were codified in 14 CFR Part 389, which were promulgatedunder the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-25, September23, 1959. Responsibility for administering these rules transferred to theDepartment following CAB Sunset.<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The fees charged for eligible services must be fair and equitable,and should be a <T3>reasonable approximation</T3> of the attributable costs that are expendedto benefit the recipients, and (b) The cost of providing a particular servicemust be divided among the beneficiaries in a fair and equitable manner.Any computation, however, must necessarily be based on <T3>numerous approximations</T3> and can only be expected to be accuratewithin reasonable limits. (Emphasis added).</ITAG>Against this background, we find that the proposed fees are consistentwith established methodology and entirely justified in the circumstances.No commenter has presented persuasive evidence to the contrary. The commentershave suggested that we use the experimental 90 day period contained inandSection; 221.500 to gather actual cost data, and to set the fee as predicatedon these costs. We shall, in fact, gather such actual cost data and examineit with an eye toward improving the accuracy of our approximations. However,in the event we are unable to gain sufficient empirical cost data duringthis period to fine-tune our filing fee, we intend to assess the <T3>interim</T3> filing fee for ``official tariff'' submissions.We would expect that once we are in an operational mode of accepting ``officialelectronic tariffs'' we will be able to determine whether the proposedfiling fee has proven accurate, insufficient, or excessive. If in factit has proven excessive, refund requests may be made under 14 CFR 389.27(b)of the Department's Organizational Regulations.We shall accept a suggestion of the commenters that the Department notassess the electronic filing fees on those existing records which are convertedfrom the paper to the electronic medium upon the implementation of the``official'' tariff. The commenters state that the assessment of an electronicfiling fee would be improper since filing fees will have already been paidunder the paper regime. We agree that this recommendation has merit andwe grant this request.The commenters request that they not be required to refile all the effectiveand prospective records when they convert from paper to an electronic mode.As an alternative they recommend that the Department accept such fare recordson a machine-readable tape. This request also has merit, and we will grantit. We will, however, require that when a filer is given final authorityto convert from the paper to the electronic mode as the ``official'' tariffthat the filer must furnish the Department with a copy of the existingeffective and prospective records on a machine-readable tape or any othermutually acceptable electronic medium. The filer will also be requiredto furnish an affidavit to the Department attesting to such records.We also want to clarify one other issue concerning conversion from paperto electronic filing. In the event that there is a discrepancy betweenthe ``official'' paper tariff and the records submitted by the filer onthe day of conversion, the records contained in the ``official'' papertariff will be the prevailing record. We will amend andSection;andSection;221.500 and 389.25(b) to accommodate these changes.Availability of Raw Tariff DataABC has requested that either the Department or the filer be required tomake available to any user or any other interested person, on a reasonable,non-discriminatory basis keyed to added costs, the ``raw tariff data''used to produce the tariff information appearing on a video display screen.ABC also recommends that these persons be able to obtain such data fromthe Department or the filer in any of the following methods: (a) Electronicallyfiled tariff data on a bulk basis by remote computer link, (b) tariff informationon an ``inquiry'' basis by remote computer link, or (c) daily magnetictapes containing all of the day's tariff transactions. ABC states that:(A) access to the ``raw tariff data'' is necessary for it to inject competitioninto the fare data collection/dissemination arena; (b) entry by othersinto the data dissemination and/or fare filing business will strengthenthe presence of market forces and will reduce the prospects of databasebias that can result when one company with a preexisting market controlsthe database; and (c) electronic access to data is a key component of thelegal requirement that an agency make adequate public dissemination ofcomplete information in its possession and control, and that it allow forredissemination by private companies in ``value added form''.On September 20, 1988, ATPCO filed a reply to ABC's comments, urging thatwe reject ABC's recommendation.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ ATPCO accompanied its reply with a motion for leave tofile an otherwise unauthorized document. We will grant the motion.ATPCO argues that ABC has confused the Department's obligation to provideaccess to tariff data with the issue of whether the Department has an obligationto disseminate such data; that in fact, no such obligation to disseminateexists, and that this rule should not be expanded to impose one. ATPCOstates that such information as that requested by ABC should be obtainedthrough the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552); that ABC currentlyobtains machine-readable tariff tapes as a value-added service from ATPCOwhich is identical to the terms offered and prices charged to other ATPCOsubscribers; that the Department must consider whether such a disseminationservice substantially duplicates similar services that would otherwisebe available from the private sector; that ABC seeks dissemination of thisdata at the Department's expense or, failing that, at the tariff filers'expense; and that ABC seeks, for its own profit-making purposes, a low-costsubscription service of machine readable tariff data which would be subsidizedby the tariff filers or the Department.On October 11, 1988, ABC filed a rejoinder to ATPCO's response, which forthe most part expands on the points it previously raised.\7\<NOTE/> ABC does however raise two additional points that warrantour consideration.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ ABC accompanied its rejoinder with a motion for leaveto file an otherwise unauthorized document. We will grant the motion.ABC argues that under the findings in <T3>Army Times Publishing Co. </T3>v.<T3> Department of the Army,</T3> 684 F. Supp. 720 (D.D.C. 1988), the Departmentis required to make bulk tariff data available in a machine-readable formatupon request. ABC further argues that, based on the Federal Maritime Commission's(FMC) report on tariff automation inquiry as set forth at 50 FR 13066,April 20, 1988, had the Department of Transportation decided to employa central DOT database (rather than using the remote databases in possessionof various tariff filers), we would be obligated to disseminate tariffinformation in a machine-readable format such as that being proposed bythe FMC.Having carefully reviewed the comments, as well as the relevant statutoryand regulatory provisions, we have decided not to accept ABC's recommendationswith respect to prescribing a cost basis for the dissemination of ``rawtariff data''. We will require the filer to provide, upon request, a copyof the machine-readable data (raw tariff data) of all daily transactionsmade to the on-line tariff database, at the terms and prices it may set,provided that they are non-discriminatory, <T3>i.e.</T3> they are substantially equivalent for all similarly-situatedpersons. (andSection; 221.600(d).) We do not, on the other hand, accept ABC'srecommendations that the Department obligate itself to disseminate electronicallyfiled data.Our principal guidance on this issue comes from OMB Circular A-130, 50FR 52730, December 24, 1985 (OMB Circular). Under the terms of the OMBCircular there is a clear distinction between ``access to information''and ``dissemination of information''. <T3>Access</T3> to information is defined ``as the function of providingto members of the public, upon their request, the government informationto which they are entitled under law''. Section 6.f. of the OMB Circular.<T3>Dissemination </T3>of information is defined ``as the function of distributinggovernment information to the public, whether through printed documents,or electronic or other media, and does not include intra-agency use ofinformation, inter-agency sharing of information, or responding to requestsfor `access to information' ''. Section 6.g. of the OMB Circular. AppendixIV to the Circular lists types of information fitting the two categories.The first category, access, refers to those situations in which the Governmentagency's role is passive; access is what the Government's responsibilitiesare when the public comes to the Government and asks for information theGovernment has and the public is entitled to, <T3>e.g.</T3> compilations of routine time and attendance records for Federalemployees, or publication of thousands of pages of common carrier tarifffilings by regulatory agencies. The second category, dissemination, refersto an active outreach by the Government, <T3>i.e.</T3> to those situations in which the Government provides thepublic with information without the public having to come and ask for it.According to the controlling OMB Circular, those situations arise wherethere is a specific statutory requirement for dissemination, where disseminationis necessary for the proper performance of agency functions, and wheresuch dissemination does not duplicate efforts in other sectors.In reviewing all of the comments to our proposed rule, there is no disagreementthat filed tariff information, be it in the paper or electronic medium,is subject to public access, as defined by the OMB Circular.\8\<NOTE/> However, the commenters plainly disagree on our proposedrule as concerns to whom, how and at what cost, filed electronic tariffinformation should be disseminated. In order to answer these questionswe are required to weigh them against the criteria contained in the OMBCircular.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ In regard to public access, ABC in its rejoiner arguesthat we are required to make copies of the machine-readable data availableunder the ``Freedom of Information Act'', based on the findings in <T3>Army Times Publishing Co. </T3>v.<T3> Department of the Army,</T3> 684 F. Supp. 720 (D.D.C. 1988). We agree.As we have said, with respect to providing services involving passengerfares filed electronically, the Department proposes to follow the provisionsregarding Freedom of Information Act requests, at 49 CFR Part 7 (also see14 CFR Part 310). (53 FR 25621.)With respect to the Government's obligation to disseminate filed tariffinformation, the first OMB criterion is whether or not the Department isrequired by a statutory mandate to do so. We find no such obligation here.This dissemination function has been the responsibility of the carrierssince 1938 under the requirements of section 403(a) of the Act. The CivilAeronautics Board confirmed and refined this statutory requirement in 1977by promulgating 14 CFR 221.179, which required the carriers to providea subscription service to their tariffs at a charge not to exceed a reasonableestimate of the added cost of providing the service. The Board stated thatthis rule would: (a) Require air carriers and foreign air carriers whichare required to file tariffs, to offer a subscription service for passengerfares, freight rates and charter services, and (b) provide for greaterdissemination of information about proposed tariff changes. See ER-1001,adopted June 1, 1977, Docket 29988, and 42 FR 28876, June 6, 1977. Thisrequirement also applies to transmission of electronic tariffs to subscribers(andSection; 221.600).ABC in its rejoinder, nevertheless argues that if we had decided to employa central DOT tariff database (rather than using the remote databases inthe possession of various filers), we would be required to disseminatemachine-readable tariff data at a reasonable, added cost basis. ABC basesits argument on the FMC's report on tariff automation at 50 FR 13066, April20, 1988. We disagree. The FMC proposes to offer the following disseminationservice:<ITAG tagnum="21">Once the tariff data is officially on file, the Commission will downloadthe entire data base in ``flat files'', formatted onto computer tapes whichwill be sold to any person at the relatively inexpensive, marginal costof dissemination. <T3>This will satisfy the Commission's statutory duty of providing copiesof tariffs at a reasonable charge.</T3> (<T3>Id.</T3> at 13066.) (Emphasis added.)</ITAG>While the FMC believes that it has such a statutory mandate, we find nosuch mandate in our statutes. Accordingly, we do not accept ABC's argumentthat we are required to disseminate data in a similar manner as that beingproposed by the FMC.The second OMB criterion is whether or not it is necessary for the properperformance of the Department's functions to disseminate filed tariff information.We do not find such a dissemination function to be necessary to DOT's mission.We note that carriers and their agents have undertaken the effort to publishtheir tariffs to such an extent that the private sector has developed anongoing market for this information.In our proposed rule at 53 FR 25617, we listed our statutory and regulatorytariff responsibilities. One of those functions was, ``The Department maintainsrecords for open access to published tariffs and to tariff filings andSTPA's''. We went on at 53 FR 25618 to state that any proposal to amendthe current tariff filing procedure must ensure that the Department canfulfill its statutory and regulatory responsibilities. We were carefulto ensure that our proposal would meet that test, and no commenter hasdemonstrated that we were unsuccessful in this regard. Our goal was not,however, to use this rulemaking as a device to expand existing tariff functions.Since we have never disseminated filed tariff information, and since nocompelling arguments have been made that would convince us to do otherwise,we find no merit to this aspect of ABC's arguments.The third criterion of OMB Circular A-130 is that an agency should refrainfrom offering those services that are provided by the private sector, especiallythose services which are normally within the province of the private sector.\9\<NOTE/> The services that ABC is requesting are currently being providedby the private sector. Specifically, as we said above, since 1938, disseminationof filed tariff information has been the responsibility of the carriers.ATPCO states that ``ABC currently obtains machine-readable tariff tapesas a value-added service from ATPCO which is identical to the terms andprices with other ATPCO subscribers.'' Accordingly, we find no merit tothe recommendation that we should disseminate filed electronic tariff informationsuch as that sought by ABC. In this regard, ABC can take no comfort fromHouse Report, H. Rpt. 99-560, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986), <T3>Electronic Collection and Dissemination of Information by Federal Agencies:</T3><T3>A Policy Overview, </T3>on which it seeks to rely. That report clearlystates that ``an agency should limit the services that it offers to thepublic and should leave the private sector to provide value-added services.An agency should not offer an information service to the public simplybecause it has the capability to provide the service.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 12.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ We note in this connection, the comments made by RobertGellman, Counsel to the United States House Subcommittee on GovernmentInformation, Justice, and Agriculture, at the Department's first meetingof its Advisory Committee on Electronic Tariff Filing System. Mr. Gellmansaid: ``If an agency sets up an automated file then releases the file inautomated form to the public, you have just destroyed the investment ofthe private sector company in creating and maintaining its database * **. I think in point-in fact, an agency should look for a way to avoid doingthat.'' Minutes at pages 25 and 26.On the other hand, we agree with ABC that the rule should provide for electronicaccess to the database maintained by each filer. Such access may facilitatethe further dissemination of tariff information to users and potentialusers through the provision of other value-added services by processingintermediaries such as ABC. ATPCO currently provides such a service inthe form of machine-readable tapes, and we see no reason why we shouldnot, as a matter of discretionary authority under the statute, requirecontinued access to this basis, without prejudice to the provision of otherremote access services as well.The other issue that is raised concerning dissemination of filed tariffinformation is the cost of such information.ABC recommends that all daily transactions to the on-line tariff databaseshould be provided in machine-readable format to any person, upon request,on an added cost basis.As ATPCO makes clear, the provision of raw tariff data is itself a value-addedservice, whether on an inquiry basis or even on a bulk machine-readablebasis, because such services involve the development and use of formatand documentation programs. We are therefore neither able nor disposedto prescribe an added-cost standard, or indeed any other particular coststandard, for the provision of such service.The OMB Circular requires that where such information is provided throughthe private sector, the prices for such information should not be unreasonable.ATPCO states that it is currently providing bulk information to all subscriberson identical terms and prices. We have received no complaints concerningthe terms and prices under which ATPCO is furnishing machine-readable dataas a value-added service and, accordingly, we have no basis to believethat ATPCO's terms and prices are other than reasonable, in the genericsense used by OMB. At the same time, we believe that it is both feasibleand desirable to provide in the rule that access to raw date, includingcharges therefor, must be on a non-discriminatory basis. We would of courseapply this standard to the raw tariff data (machine-readable data) thatany other filer chooses to file with the Department.Consistent with our statutory obligations and the OMB Circular, we believethat our rule achieves an equitable balance between the needs of the Department,the filer, the public, the private sector and any other interested personin obtaining access and dissemination of the electronic tariff databases.Accordingly, we will add to andSection; 221.600 provisions that will requirethe filer to provide to any person a copy of the machine-readable dataof all daily transactions made to its on-line tariff database on a non-discriminatorybasis, that is, one in which the terms and prices are substantially equivalentfor all similarly-situated persons. We are also adding to andSection; 221.4a definition for machine-readable data as a result of our requirementsunder andSection; 221.600.In this connection, we note that IIA has made a similar request, in seekingthat we require all daily tariff data to be consolidated onto a singlestorage medium for availability to the public. As with ABC, we see thisas going to matters of dissemination best resolved in the private sectorthrough commercial arrangements and, to the extent that we are not adoptingABC's suggestions, we shall not adopt that of IIA. Remote Access ABC agrues that the rule's provisions guaranteeing remote access for thepublic to the filer's on-line tariff database are ambiguous. The basicproblem ABC percieves is that the rule does not clearly define what ismeant by remote access. By way of clarification, we recall that we statedin the preamble to our NPRM at 53 FR page 25620, that we would requirea filer to make its on-line tariff database available to the public, atDOT headquarters, at no charge, during normal business hours. We said thatthe public would have access to this data through a filer supplied ``CRT''.A CRT with an attending central processing unit converts machine-readabledata into letters and numbers which then may be read by an individual.The data displayed on a CRT is generally labeled as ``output data''. Weexpect the public to have access to this output data in our public tariffreference room. (Sections 221.260 (b)(2) and (b)(3)). A filer must alsoprovide a subscription service to this output data under the terms of andSection;221.600(b) of our rule.\10\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ We note that our functional definition of ``remote access''is consistent with DOT's reply comments to the Interstate Commerce Commission'sproposed electronic filing of tariffs in Ex Parte No. 444, <T3>i.e</T3>., that subscribers should have remote access to the formaltariff for a reasonable fee, and that hard copies of the electronic tariffcould be made by subscribers by means of their printers. The Hold HarmlessClauses Section 221.260(b)(2) would require electronic filers to install computerequipment in the Public Reference Room at Departmental headquarters andto indemnify and hold harmless the Department and the U.S. Government fromany claims or liabilities resulting from the defects in the equipment,its installation or maintenance. IIA raised the question as to the whetherthis requirement was intended to apply also the information available throughthe equipment. It was concerned that we would required the filer to indemnifythe Government for any claims resulting from information that was not accurateor lacked integrity. This clause was not intended to apply to the information contained in theon-line tariff database. That database is generated by and maintained bythe filer, who is responsible to the public for its accuracy and integrity.To make this clear, we will require that all filers include a statement,each time their systems are accessed, to the fact that: ``The informationcontained in this system is for informational purposes only, and is a representationof tariff data that has been formally submitted to the Department of Transportationin accordance with applicable law or a bilateral treaty to which the U.S.Government is a party''. (andSection; 221.260(c)). Technical CommentsVarious commenters object to those requirements of andSection; 221.260 thatwould require the on-line tariff database to be available 24 hours a day,7 days a week. The commenters allege that this would be unduly burdensomeand needlessly expensive. As an alternative the commenters recommend thatthe fiber be permitted to bring its computer down between 6:00 a.m. and6:00 p.m. on Sundays, when necessary for maintenance or other operationalreasons. We regard the proposed alternative as reasonable and as non-prejudicialto our ability to meet our program goals; accordingly, we shall adopt it.(andSection; 221.260(b)(5)). Various commenters object to the requirements of andSection; 221.260 thatwould require the primary circuit to be restored within four hours afterfailure. The commenters state that the restoration of the circuit placeson then an obligation beyond their control, since the line is the responsibilityof the phone company. Their concern appears valid, and we will relievethem of the obligation, <T3>provided that</T3>: the filer must notify the Chief of the TariffsDivision of the Department's Office of International Aviation as soon aspossible after the failure of the primary circuit, but not later than twohours after failure, and must provide the name of a contact person at thetelephone company who has the responsibility for dealing with the problem.(andSection; 221.260(b)(13)). Various commenters seek clarification of those requirements of andSection;221.260 that would require the filer to make data fields available to theDepartment in any record which is part of the on-line tariff database.The commenters state that the data elements need to be identified and thatthere needs to be a description of the use to be made of the data fieldsand a specification on their size. We are not in a position at this timeto furnish this information. We first must have in place our local areanetwork, the equipment we will employ to download the data, and firm plansfor the ultimate use of such data. Further, since this is one of the requirementsfor filing, we wish to ensure that we will maintain our right to requirea filer to make fields available to us upon a reasonable request. Various commenters object to the requirements of andSection; 221.283(a)(4)that would require the tariff number to be included in the Filing AdviceStatus File. The commenters state that this file is intended to serve asan index to the Government Filing File and, therefore, that the inclusionof the tariff number in the former file serves no useful purpose. We agreeand have deleted this requirement. Various commenters object to andSection; 221.283(b)(7)(ii) because underit the Department would not be required to give its reasons for approvalsor disapprovals of filed tariffs. The commenters say that this would becontrary to our current practice. They suggest that andSection; 221.283(b)(7)(ii)be revised to read ``Actions taken and reasons therefor.'' The commentersare correct that we have traditionally provided reasons for our decisions.Since it was not our intent to adopt a new policy in this regard, we willadopt the proposed change. As a related matter, we have revised andSection;221.283(b)(7)(iii) to read ``Remarks, except that internal Departmentaldata shall not be made public.'' This will ensure that the Department hasthe capability to send germane remarks to the filer which may or may notrelate to the specific approval or disapproval of a particular tariff.Various commenters seek clarification of the term ``Routing (RG)'' as usedin andSection;andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(viii) and 221.283(c)(8). The commentersstate that these sections should actually refer to ``Routing Number(s).''We shall adopt this change. We also feel it needs to be made clear thatmany fares are subject to the abbreviation ``MPM'' (maximum permissiblemileage), and we have amended the rule to include these changes.Various commenters object to the provisions of andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(ix)that require the filer to show a discontinue date. The commenters statethat the use of a discontinue date is confusing since such a date is onlyused when a fare has been superseded by a subsequent fare record. The commentersrecommend that andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(ix) be amended to read ``Effectivedate and discontinue date if the record has been superseded.'' We willmake this change. As a related matter, we will also add a andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(xi)to read ``Expiration date.'' Our reason for this change is that when wewere drafting the rule we had considered ``discontinue date'' to be synonymouswith ``expiration date'', since many proposed fares bear an expirationdate. We now realize this may not have been correct. Various commenters object to the requirement of andSection; 221.284 thatunique rule numbers be used for certain types of fares. While they do notoppose the concept of using unique rule numbers for certain fare types,they would prefer that rule numbers be set by mutual agreement betweenthe filer and the Department rather than by rule. They further state thatthe specification of rule numbers by regulation could adversely affectthe industry, if in fact those rule numbers were in conflict with rulenumbers that had been used over the years to identify certain other faretypes. We do not find this proposal to be unreasonable and we have amendedthe rule to provide for this. Various commenters object to the requirement of andSection; 221.285 thatthe filer annotate the fare records in the name of the former carrier whensuch carrier is adopted by another carrier. The commenters recommend asan alternative that the adoption be stated in the justification when thefares are electronically filed. We will not adopt these recommendations.The information at issue is important to our ability to research historicalfares and is also useful for other regulatory purposes. Following the courseproposed by the commenters thus would have a negative impact on our abilityto perform the tariff function. Such a result would be inconsistent withour overriding principles in streamlining the tariff system. Finally, wedo not perceive this requirement to be an undue burden on any filer. Therefore,we will not accept this proposal. The commenters also state that the ruleis unclear as to how long the note must be maintained. Here, we agree thatthe rule is ambiguous, and we have clarified it. Specifically, we intendedthat the note would have to appear only once, when the fares are initiallyadopted. We have amended our rule to provide for this clarification. (andSection;221.285). Various commenters recommend that andSection; 221.302 be amended to providethat a filer submitting a Special Tariff Permission Application under thissection need file the associated paper page only once. This would be achievedby allowing the filer to file the paper page in the final proposed paperformat with reference to the appropriate electronic filing advice number.The page would also bear a consecutive revision number and an issued andproposed effective date. If for some reason all or part of the proposalwere denied or other action were taken against the proposal, the page wouldbe revised promptly to remove such information. We will approve this changein the rule subject to one modification. We will require that when we denyor take other action against any page so filed under revised andSection;221.302, the filer must revise and file an amended page reflecting ouraction within two business days following the denial or other action.Various commenters state that under the terms of andSection; 221.500 it isnot clear whether, during the 90-day experimental period when the fileris required to file electronic tariffs, the electronic or the paper tariffis to be considered as the ``official tariff.'' It was and still is ourintention that during the experimental period the ``official tariff'' wouldbe the paper tariff. We have amended our rule to make this clear. Various commenters suggest that, during our proposed 90-day experimentalperiod, if they should choose to take advantage of electronic filing, thatthey not be required to file all fares electronically. They say that beingrequired to file all fares would pose an undue burden on the filer anda strain on the Department's resources. We will not accept this suggestion.First, we are not convinced that the need to file all fares will pose theproblems for the filers or for our own resources that the commenters predict.More importantly, though, even if such problems were to arise, we wouldnot regard them, on balance, as sufficient justification for followinga different approach. The critical goal of the 90-day experimental periodis to provide both the filers and the Department with an authentic ``dryrun'' under the electronic system. To this end, we are convinced that weshould seek to have the data going into the system be as nearly approximateto that with which the system_and our staff_will have to cope followingthe end of the experimental period. Only in this way can the experimentalperiod serve its purpose of assuring the Department, the industry, andthe public that the electronic system is indeed ready to assume its roleas a repository of official tariffs. In addition, we would note that the proposal for less than complete filingruns counter to the recommendation of those same commenters that the 90-dayexperimental period be used to determine the appropriate electronic filingfee. Plainly, for such calculations to be meaningful, they must be derivedfrom a system operating in a fashion closely approximating that which willprevail following the experiment, <T3>i.e.,</T3> a system where the electronically filing carriers will befiling all fares, not just selected ones.Various commenters suggest that andSection; 221.260(b)(3) be revised to allowthe filer to assess a fee on a public user at Departmental headquarterswhen the user makes copies from a filer's printer located in the Department'sPublic Tariff Reference Room. The commenters state that this proposal isconsistent with the preamble of the rule, but that no such enabling provisionswere contained in the rule. We agree with the commenters. This omissionwas a drafting oversight that we will correct. We will not, however, includethese provisions in andSection; 221.260, since this section relates to requirementsfor filing. Instead we will add a new andSection; 221.650 permitting thefiler to assess a reasonable fee for copies of tariffs made from the filer'sprinter, provided that no administrative burden is placed on the Departmentto require the collection of the fee or to provide services. Venturi Associates, the primary tariff watching service in the Department'sTariff Public Reference Room, recommends that if any user charges are madefor public access at Departmental headquarters that they not be cost prohibitive.Our intent was that access at Departmental headquarters would be providedwithout charge. To the extent this may not have been clear in our NPRM,we confirm it here. We will consider those individuals working for ``tariffwatching services'' to be members of the public; access at Departmentalheadquarters will be provided to them without charge. IIA recommends that, if there be more than one filer, we consider consolidatingthe information into a single data feed at Departmental headquarters inorder to provide for easier access by the public. At this early stage weare not in a position to determine whether the suggestion would be costeffective or whether it indeed would be genuinely necessary. We will monitorthe situation in this regard as we gain experience under the new system.In the event there is more than one filer, we will take the necessary stepsto have a menu driven screen that will provide easy access to the publicto each filer's database. IIA recommends that public access to all electronic data at Departmentalheadquarters be provided through a single terminal located in the TariffPublic Reference Room. While we can appreciate the benefits that wouldaccrue to the public under this recommendation, we are not persuaded thatwe can direct the filers to use a common terminal. Under our rule eachfiler is required to install its <T3>own</T3> terminal in the Tariff Public Reference Room for public access.Therefore, in order to provide for a common terminal, the filers wouldhave to reach an accord to provide it. Of course, the filers can considerIIA's recommendation when installing their terminals in the Tariff PublicReference Room, and we would urge them to do so.Other Issues In drafting the rule we overlooked one point that we want to clarify here.In andSection;andSection; 221.283(b)(8)(vii) and 221.283(c)(7) the filer isrequired to show the controlling fare rule number. The rule as currently drafted makes no provision for the situation wherethe controlling rule is published in a separate governing tariff. In orderto resolve this problem we are amending these two sections to require thatappropriate reference be made to the tariff containing the controllingfare rule. <ITAG tagnum="85">Executive Order 12291, Regulatory Flexibility Act, and Paperwork ReductionAct, Federalism Assessment </ITAG>The Department certifies that this rule is not a major rule as definedby Executive Order 12291. It is, however, considered a significant ruleunder the Department's policies and procedures because it involves importantDepartmental policies and is a matter of significant interest to the aviationindustry. We have prepared a Regulatory Evaluation which is summarizedbelow. Copies of the evaluation have been placed in Docket 43343. (A copymay be obtained by contacting Thomas G. Moore, Chief, Tariffs Division,P-44, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street SW., Washington, DC20590, Telephone: (202) 366-2414.) Further, I certify that this rule wouldnot have significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitieswithin the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354. Virtuallyall airlines that provide international air transportation are large corporations.This rule been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that theconcepts discussed therein do not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a federalism assessment.With respect to the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, Public Law 96-511,this rule will produce a small increase in the carriers' reporting burdenbecause of their need to make formal application to file electronically.This new information requirement has been submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget for approval.However, we believe that the net paperwork burden associated with the tarifffiling requirements should dramatically decrease. For example, in 1987,the international airlines filed with the Department 241,230 tariff pagesapplicable to international air transportation. Of this total, 219,503applied to passenger service, and 21,727 applied to cargo service. Of the219,503 tariff pages filed, we estimate that 65 percent involved passengerfares only. Assuming all carriers currently filing tariffs in paper formelect to file electronically, we would estimate an actual paperwork reductionof 142,676 pages filed with the Department, which would produce a reductionof approximately 60 percent in the paperwork burden. As we said above, carriers, or their agents, electing to file tariffs electronicallywill be subject to a new reporting requirement. Specifically, they willneed to make a one-time application under andSection; 221.260 for authorizationto file tariffs electronically. However, we expect these applications tobe straightforward and short, not exceeding a few pages. Given the thousandsof pages of paperwork to be saved by this electronic filing option, webelieve that, on balance, the paperwork involved in the initial applicationwould be a minor burden.Regulatory EvaluationThe Department received many comments to our ANPRM which indicated that,while electronic filing could be expected to reduce the costs of filingtariffs, the magnitude of any such changes were difficult to quanitifyabsent a specific ETS proposal. We solicited comments in our NPRM on theeconomic impact of our proposed rule. None were received. As we stated in our ANPRM, and again in our NPRM, it costs the governmentover $500,000 a year and the industry at least $5 million a year to fileand process printed tariffs. The benefits that will accrue to the government,the public and the industry by automating the tariff filing system areclear. All of the comments that we have received to date confirm that automationwould be beneficial. Our March 1987 <T3>Cost-Benefit Analysis,</T3> which detailed costs (in excess of $21million a year, with 78 percent of such costs being borne by the industry)and benefits that could accrue to both the Government and the industrywith automation, further concluded that it was clearly cost-effective toautomate the tariff filing function.In its petition, ATPCO stated that the ability to file fares tariffs electronicallywould reduce industry tariff costs by over $2.5 million per year, justfor printing cost. ATPCO went on to state that the industry would alsobenefit financially from the ability to implement new fare packages morequickly in an automated environment than under the paper filing system.The government would also benefit. Right now, our tariff workload has reacheda saturation point and we fully expect this workload to continue to increasesubstantially. Under these circumstances, we are finding it increasinglydifficult to fulfill our statutory and regulatory responsibilities. A principal feature of this rule is that it would be permissive. That is,it would provide carriers wishing to file fares electronically the optionof doing so. It would not, however, eliminate the current, paper-basedsystem. Carriers preferring to file as they have been doing could continueto do so. We believe the rule will reduce economic and paperwork burdenson the industry and on the government. But the key point is that the impactof this rule is within the discretion of the affected parties. To the extentthat there is impact, the impact promises to be positive. We believe that implementation of the rule will provide the Departmentand the industry with some much-needed paperwork relief, even while theDepartment continues its work on the ETS. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>14 CFR Part 221Air fares and rates, Explosives, Freight, Handicapped, Contracts, Claims,Consumer protection.
