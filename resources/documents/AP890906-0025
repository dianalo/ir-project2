The backlog of 35,000 Soviet Jews seeking entry to the UnitedStates poses economic and philosophic problems. After encouragingMoscow to lower barriers to emigration, it would be awkward for theUnited States to restrict admission.   A total of 22,462 Soviet immigrants _ not all of them Jews _entered the United States in a nine-month period that ended June 30,according to the State Department.   Figures released Tuesday night showed a steep increase over afour-year period: from 640 in 1985 to 20,421 in 1988.   Under consideration to deal with the increase, a U.S. officialsaid Tuesday, is a six-month waiting period for emigres who don'thave close relatives in the United States.   There also is a proposal to process refugees in Moscow, phasingout the Vienna offices through which many of the emigres pass.Processing the emigres in Moscow would mean the addition of dozensof U.S. workers there to handle paperwork.   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, stressedthat no decision had been made, although one may be imminent.   ``We are not prepared to announce any policy decisions at thistime,'' said State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler.   She estimated that more than 50,000 Soviets, not all of themJews, would apply to emigrate to the United States this year.   Although most Soviet Jews file applications to go to Israel, thevast majority opt for the United States once they reach Vienna.   That distresses the Israeli government and many of its supporterswho see in the Soviet Jewish population the last large reservoir ofpotential immigrants to help build up the Jewish state.   It isn't clear whether closing the Vienna office would have theeffect of increasing the flow to Israel. Once an emigre goes thereor to any other country it is more difficult to gain admission tothe United States.   ``There is no consensus at the State Department to close the dooron anyone,'' the official said, disputing a published report thatSoviet Jews who don't have close relatives in the United Stateswould become ineligible.   However, the official said, they could be kept on hold for sixmonths in the Soviet Union. Those who didn't gain entry might applyfor parole status, which requires support from private organizations.   Meanwhile, Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said the FBIhad expressed concern that a large influx of Soviet emigres couldincrease the likelihood of spying.   Although there have been discussions about curbing Sovietimmigration, ``the Justice Department has not signed off on anyproposal at this time,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
