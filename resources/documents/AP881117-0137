John Warner, R-Va., said Thursday thatmeeting health and safety concerns should be a main component in thedecision on whether to keep open a Virginia plant that makes``absolutely critical'' components for rocket nozzles.   ``It is essential to our national security to keep this plantoperating, providing we can meet the health and safety concerns ofthe people in the immediate area,'' Warner said after headingg ameeting between the federal and state agencies concerned with theAvtex Fiber Inc. plant in Front Royal, Va.   The closed-door meeting was intended to trade information aboutthe situation among the various agencies, Warner said.   NASA and the Pentagon want Avtex to stay in business, because theplant is the only supplier for a carbonizable rayon fiber which is akey component of rocket nozzles for the space shuttle and some ofthe Air Force's nuclear-tipped weapons.   But the Environmental Protection Agency and the Virginia attorneygeneral's office want Avtex to clean up the plant that has a historyof environmental and worker safety problems.   On Oct. 31, Avtex Chairman John Gregg announced he would closethe Front Royal plant because of environmental regulations andforeign competition for other textile products made by Avtex. Greggstopped production Nov. 3, but recalled the work force one weeklater as the government began a bailout of Avtex.   Last week, NASA gave Avtex $7 million for the rights to thefiber. The space agency said it will sign an $11 million contractfor the fiber, if Avtex can show by Friday it will generate enoughcontracts to keep the plant in business.   Warner noted that only three or four percent of the Avtex'sproduction involves the nozzle materials.   But he said ``it would require as much as two years'' to developanother source for this material. In the meantime, U.S. nationalsecurity could be harmed if missiles couldn't be launched, he said.One example he gave was the use of Air Force missiles to launchreconnaissance satellites.   One major concern, Warner said, is to make sure that any federalbailout money is not used to pay off any fines which could be leviedagainst Avtex.</TEXT></DOC>
