Justo Ricardo Somarriba, a $3.50-an-hour hardware store clerkwho entered the country illegally in 1987, picked up his firstannual check of $240,000 in Tallahassee on Monday after picking allsix numbers in Florida's Lotto drawing Saturday.   On Wednesday, after U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Serviceofficials revealed that the State Department had failed to supportSomarriba's request for political asylum, INS district directorPerry Rivkind reviewed the case and decided Somarriba and hisfamily deserved legal residency.   ``I never expected this would happen in this country,''Somarriba said of his family's newfound protected-immigrant statusas well as its financial windfall. ``It's just great.''   Somarriba probably would face repression if he returned toNicaragua, said Rivkind, adding, ``This has nothing to do with thejackpot.''   ``He was a teacher in the government education department, andthere is no question he resisted Sandinista propagandizing in theschool system,'' Rivkind said. ``That clearly gives hims awell-founded fear of persecution.''   Rivkind then joked: ``Now that he is a captialist, I think theMarxists would like him even less.''   Somarriba quit his job after confirming his winnings and said hehoped to use the money to bring the rest of his family fromNicaragua and open his own hardware store in the United States.   Like about 40,000 other Nicaraguans in Florida, Somarriba wasemployed under a special work permit while waiting for his asylumapplication to be processed.   Early last year, the State Department refused to supportSomarriba's petition, saying it had insufficient information.   Rivkind said the State Department, which previously madeyes-or-no recommendations on almost all such applications, haslately avoided making decisions on about half of the requests sentits way.   Even if Somarriba's request had been denied, however, it isunlikely he would have been deported.   Deportation notices must be approved by the Justice Department,and so far the agency has returned only convicted criminals toNicaragua, said Rivkind, adding the remaining deportation requestsare simply stalled in Washington.   In addition, anyone who is denied asylum can appeal thatdecision, a process that usually takes one to two years.   Lottery officials said even if he hadn't received asylum hewould have gotten to keep the money.   Somarriba, from Masaya, Nicaragua, about 90 miles south ofManagua, entered the United States in March 1987 by crossing theRio Grande near Brownsville, Texas, said Richard Smith, deputy INSdirector.   He lives with his wife, Maria Elena, and three children, RosaElena, 9, Maria, 7, and Yuliza, 3.</TEXT></DOC>
