Freeway Blvd., Sacramento, CA95834; (916) 646-1111.andM;List Price: $595.andM;Requires: 3MB RAM, 80286 processor or higher, 20MB hard disk (40MBrecommended), Presentation Manager-supported graphics adapter (VGArecommended), OS/2 1.1 or later; mouse also recommended.andM;In Short: The first Presentation Manager word processor lacks some crucialfeatures and suffers from a clumsy menu structure, but has the best undofeature in the industry.andP;  Version 1.1, due this spring, is the program thatVersion 1.0 should have been; it includes extensive formatting and slightlybetter organization.andM;DeScribe, the only word processor available for OS/2 Presentation Manager, isa lot like OS/2 itself.andP;  DeScribe's $595 &quot;word publisher&quot; represents aradical rethinking of its product category.andP;  And just like OS/2, DeScribe isnot quite ready to be launched on the public, although it will be a splendidproduct when it is finished.andM;It already boasts one spectacular feature that you'll never see in DOS--anulimited undo function.andP;  Like a time machine, it lets you move backwardthrough an entire editing session and bring a block of text you discarded anhour ago into your current version, or even return to the version youprepared two hours ago and start over from there.andM;In its basic structure, DeScribe resembles Windows-based word processing anddesktop publishing programs.andP;  You use styles to format text and &quot;objects&quot; (orframes) to locate text and graphics on the page.andP;  Once you move beyond thebasics, however, DeScribe looks different and is potentially more powerfulthan its cousins on the Windows side of the GUI family.andP;  Because it runsunder OS/2, DeScribe can open as many as 18 files--the operating systemrefuses to open any more.andP;  In DOS-based programs, all the styles availablefor a document appear on the style menu, even though many are suitable onlyfor sections like title pages or indexes.andP;  In DeScribe, you can clear theclutter by organizing stylesheets on a hierarchical structure resembling adirectory tree.andM;For example, the &quot;root&quot; stylesheet might contain the styles for the main bodytext of a book.andP;  A subdirectory of styles for chapters starts with thecharacteristics of the root directory, but can contain new styles exclusiveto itself.andP;  This means that when you work on an ordinary chapter of a book,only the styles for chapters are displayed on a menu; when you work on thetitle page, a different set of styles is displayed.andP;  While its style menu canbe confusing because the &quot;path&quot; of a stylesheet looks like the path of adirectory, it makes complex documents easier to manage.andP;  Another possiblesource of confusion is DeScribe's refusal to put a check next to the stylethat applies to the current cursor position.andP;  You can only find its name on astatus line at the foot of the screen.andM;In DeScribe, Version 1.0, the objects aren't any better than the frames foundin DOS in Windows-based programs.andP;  In one way, they're more annoying becauseyou have to give a name to every object you create.andP;  You don't need to createan object if you simply want to enter ordinary text, but you do need objectsif you want to divide your page into separate elements.andP;  If text overflows anobject on the page, the object can be automatically repeated on alternatepages if you want a different layout on the left and right pages.andP;  However,there's no way to flow text from an object on the second page to an object onthe fifth page, or between different-sized objects on different pages.andM;POWERFUL BUT UNCOMPROMISINGandM;DeScribe's formatting is as powerful and flexible as any other product on themarket, although you sometimes have to go through contortions to apply it.andO;Defining a style is straightforward enough; as in Ami Professional, you setfont and point size from a large menu, and choose optional submenus for textattributes, alignment, hyphenation defaults, and other features.andP;  Applyingdirect formatting to a block of text is a different story: you mustrepeatedly reopen a small format menu and then choose a separate submenu forfont, point size, and some, but not all, of the features available on themain style menu.andP;  The point-size submenu lists only a few sizes, and fromthere you can't enter a size that's not represented.andP;  If you do want a sizethat isn't there, including something as common as 11-point, reopen theformat menu and choose the Other submenu.andM;DeScribe gives you full control over word spacing and letter spacing, andeven lets you adjust the ratio of spaces between words and letters.andP;  You canformat a character in a header or footer as a page number, and DeScribe willautomatically increment the number on subsequent pages.andP;  You can also choosea language as part of the definition of a paragraph style, and DeScribe willswitch from an English-language dictionary to optional foreign or technicaldictionaries when spell-checking that text.andP;  Among DOS programs, onlyWordPerfect has a similar feature.andM;As far as word processors go, DeScribe is the most uncompromising in itsWYSIWYG abilities.andP;  In Version 1.0 you can enter and edit text only on afull-scale representation of the printed page, and you can't switch to anunformatted draft mode for better speed.andP;  You can see the bottom of one pagethe top of the next at the same time, but you can't tell DeScribe to hide thetop and bottom page margins if you prefer to use your screen for text insteadof white space.andP;  As in Microsoft Word you can open separate windows on thesame file, and edit different sections in each window.andP;  In Version 1.1, whichshould be out by the time you read this, you can zoom in for a close-up lookat small details, and split the screen to edit on a full-scale image in onewindow while simultaneously observing the changes in another windowcontaining reduced thumbnail image of one or more pages.andM;Although you can only view your work at one scale, Version 1.0 gives you manyways of seeing it.andP;  You can choose a clean display or one that shows formatcodes like tabs and carriage returns, various status indicators, a ruler, orany combination of these.andP;  You can replace images with empty boxes to improvescrolling speed, and DeScribe is even considerate enough to let you stop thecursor from blinking.andM;As in Ami Professional and Microsoft Word for Windows, you can add macros tomenus.andP;  A simple mail-merge system is actually a macro added to the menu oninstallation.andP;  According to your tastes DeScribe even lets you attach acustom help file to a macro when you assign it to a menu, and it lets youeasily reorganize everything in its entire menu system.andM;VAULTING AMBITIONandM;DeScribe, is extraordinarily ambitious in some areas, surprisingly timid inothers.andP;  Both its speller and thesaurus include definitions, and the spellercan flag punctuation errors, in addition to conducting two simultaneoussearch and replace operations.andP;  After you record a macro, or write one usingthe advanced macro language, you can compress it for greater speed with theprogram's built-in macro compiler.andP;  If you use DeScribe as a program editor,you can link it to a separate compiler, and move interactively between it andthe compiler when the latter reports errors.andP;  The program also takes periodic&quot;snapshots&quot; of your work so that after a system crash, it can automaticallyrestore you almost to the point where you left off.andM;For all its features, however, Version 1.0 is essentially a rough sketch ofwhat a GUI word processor should be.andP;  It lacks indexing, footnoting, lists,and tables of contents.andP;  It doesn't let you jump to a specific page--you haveto scroll through the file until you find the one you want.andP;  It doesn'tsupport superscripts or subscript, but makes you define them manually via amacro.andP;  It displays a ruler at the top of the screen, but doesn't let you doanything with it.andP;  You can only import ASCII text files or, by way of theclipboard, Presentation Manager graphics metafiles.andP;  The manual is merely atour through the menus instead of a real guide for getting anything done.andO;Additionally, on PC Labs' benchmark tests, DeScribe produced oftendisappointing results--generally slower than Word for Windows running underthe heavy burden of Windows 2.11.andM;To install Version 1.0, you run a primitive batch file that won't let you useany drive higher than F.andP;  Once you get the program installed, consideryourself lucky if you manage to print with anything other than a PostScriptdevice.andP;  You can't really blame DeScribe for printer problems, since you haveto be lucky to be able to print at all under OS/2.andP;  However, DeScribe Inc.andO;can be criticized for the fact that technical support is free only for 90days.andP;  After that, single users pay $95 per year, corporations $1,100.andO;Optionally, you can use a credit card to buy 3 minutes of support for tendollars and one dollar per minute thereafter.andP;  All this for a program that'spricey to begin with?andM;HOPE FOR THE FUTUREandM;Most of DeScribe's limitations are eliminated in Version 1.1, which I testedin the form of a late beta copy.andP;  Actually, this is the version that shouldhave appeared in the first place.andP;  It includes extensive graphics and wordprocessing import filters, and adds an impressive set of drawing tools.andP;  Italso supports borders, drop capitals, superscripts and subscripts, tables ofcontents, indexes, and lists.andP;  The ruler at the top of the screen finallylets you adjust tabs, and you can protect text against revision and unprotectit with a password.andM;Even DeScribe 1.1 doesn't have all the pieces in place, though.andP;  It stilllacks footnoting and the format menu, and although it includes options thatmake it easier to use, it doesn't make it easy enough.andP;  But if you need aword processor for Presentation Manager, DeScribe 1.1 isn't merely the onlychoice--it's a choice you can live with until a future version fulfills theprogram's promise .andP;  .  .  or until a full-featured rival arrives.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
