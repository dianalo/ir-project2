March-delivery juice dropped 2.1 cents a pound to $1.691, erasing most of Monday's 2.55-cent gain.    &quot;Some people expected the cold weather to have already begun affecting the Florida crop, but when temperatures didn't drop as much as expected, selling was triggered in futures,&quot; said Judy Weissman-Ganes, analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.    Traders now believe that either temperatures today and tomorrow may not decline as much as had been forecast or that the intensity and duration of the cold might not be great enough to cause damage, Mrs. Weissman-Ganes said.    &quot;But we're not out of the woods yet with this cold wave,&quot; she said. &quot;There are still several days of cold weather ahead.&quot;    The National Weather Service on Monday forecast temperatures along the northern edge of Florida's citrus-growing area would fall to 27 to 32 degrees Fahrenheit, with warmer weather farther south.    &quot;Temperatures only dropped to 39 to 42 degrees,&quot; said Peter Leavitt, meteorologist for Weather Services Inc., Bedford, Mass.    The national service forecast temperatures for last night to drop to 22 to 26 degrees in the northern fringes, 24 to 28 degrees in the interior, and as low as 21 degrees in some low-lying pockets. Late yesterday it raised the forecasts two degrees.    &quot;Traders may have become unduly alarmed Monday because trees are more heavily laden with oranges than is normal at this time of the year due to dry weather that delayed development of the crop,&quot; Mr. Leavitt said.    In other commodity markets yesterday: -   PRECIOUS METALS: Gold prices fell for the third consecutive session, to $469.10 an ounce for current delivery on the Commodity Exchange in New York. The fall, while only 20 cents an ounce, sustained the sharp $8.20 drop Monday. Silver and platinum regained Monday's losses, however. Analysts said the gold market, weakened by a dissipation of inflation fears, is looking for a new, lower trading range. That range, said Dennis Suskind, a partner at the metals-trading firm J. Aron andamp; Co. and its parent, Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., might be $465 to $485.    INTEREST RATES: Prices of bond futures fell nearly a point in the wake of a larger-than-expected 6.7% increase in December durable-goods orders. Economists surveyed by the Dow Jones Capital Markets Report had estimated a 0.4% increase. &quot;The durable-goods numbers obviously affected the market,&quot; said Jeffrey Priest, head of fixed-income trading at Miller, Tabak, Hirsch andamp; Co., New York. &quot;Maybe businesses will reinvest in plant and equipment, which is bad news for bond traders&quot; in that it indicates the economy may heat up, which could lead to higher interest rates, he said. Prices of treasury-bond futures regained nearly a half point by midday, but then a late round of selling by dealers to even out positions ahead of today's release of fourth-quarter Gross National Product figures pushed prices back to near their lows for the day. Economists are expecting GNP to have grown at about a 3.8% annual rate in the quarter, according to the Capital Markets Report. Adding uncertainty to the market is the quarterly Treasury auction scheduled for next week of three-year, 10-year and 30-year securities, traders said.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Wheat-futures prices rose amid news that China bought 300,000 metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat and Egypt purchased 137,000 tons, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. As part of its drive to reduce U.S. stockpiles, the Agriculture Department compensates exporters that sell U.S. wheat to targeted countries at lower world rates. The uptick in prices was supported by continuing speculation that the U.S. will subsidize additional wheat sales to the Soviet Union. The speculation was fueled by trade reports that the Soviets might have recently purchased wheat from Argentina for $12 a ton more than it last paid for subsidized U.S. wheat. &quot;All we have to do is offer them wheat and they'd buy it,&quot; said one trader. Soybean-futures prices fell amid news that rain is helping the crop in Brazil, one of the U.S.'s major soybean competitors. &quot;The crop continues to look better and better,&quot; said Richard Loewy, senior grain and oilseed analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., New York. As a result of recent rains, traders see better chances of high yields in both Brazil and Argentina.    COTTON: Futures prices extended Monday's decline. March-delivery cotton nearly fell the daily permissible limit of two cents a pound, ending at 61.78 cents a pound, down 1.82 cents. &quot;Lacking any fundamental factors, trading took on a technical tone,&quot; said Ernest Simon, cotton specialist for Prudential-Bache Securities. Selling accelerated when the March-contract broke below support levels of 62.90 cents and then 62.80 cents, he said. </TEXT></DOC>
