 The programs look like SAA applications, and there are versionsfor all the SAA architectures - but of course you couldn't load the OS/2 codeon an MVS machine with any hope of having it run, as is the ultimate promiseof SAA.andP;  The OfficeVision Family, insists IBM, is an evolutionary step fromexisting IBM office products - IBMers have privately described it rather moreapocalyptically - and provides integrated office applications, with emphasison compatible function and data sharing.andP;  Each series consists of a baseproduct and separate optional products, so that IBM can extract maximumreturn on the development effort.andP;  The base provides communications andservices for OS/2 Extended Edition and MS-DOS workstations, &quot;and enhances thecapabilities for non- programmable terminals in the host series&quot;.andP;  TheOfficeVision/2 LAN Series means that the complete office system can be set upwithout a host, and the function of the LAN Series is also included in theOS/2 Office Feature and the OS/2 Office DOS Requester Feature of each hostOfficeVision series.andP;  And the whole is designed for painless integration, sothat IBM- developed, customer and third party applications can be integratedusing programming interfaces to provide easy access by users.andO;Non-programmable terminals as well as directly connected MS-DOS and OS/2Extended Edition personal computers  provide  access to host officeapplications in each host series, so IBM is not forcing users to installbrand new PS/2s everywhere if they want to follow it down the OfficeVisionroute - at least not initially.andM;OfficeVision/2 LAN Series for PS/2andM;The OfficeVision/2 LAN Series is the OS/2  member of the newandM;family, and of course provides an SAA Common User Access graphical model with&quot;workplace extension&quot; implemented on OS/2 Extended Edition for use in each ofthe SAA environments of MVS, VM, OS/400 and OS/2.andP;  Release 1 includes supportfor mail, correspondence processing, address book, file system and telephony,but that's pretty slim pickings: users need Release 2 for diary, decisionsupport, an electronic filing cabinet, library, on-line help and tutorials,and integrated application support.andP;  MS-DOS users get a user interfacesimilar to that for the OS/2 user.andP;  OfficeVision/2 also ties together otherhost and OS/2-based applications, and can distribute to and receive mail fromVM, MVS, OS/400, VSE and IBM local network systems.andP;  The thing of course putsup screen icons, and &quot;In the OS/2 environment the IBM OfficeVision/2, officeobjects behave as would the everyday objects they represent, promoting easeof learning and use&quot;, says IBM intriguingly - does that mean that if someonehas taken something out of the library, no-one else can get at it until ithas been returned?andP;  IBM also claims it helps to reduce the time and overheadof system administration since all installation of occurs directly onto theOfficeVision/2 server rather than individual requesters, minimising the workneeded to set up a group of users and reducing problems associated withprogram maintenance.andP;  It costs a one-time $750 for OS/2 Office Feature, $210for the DOS Requester, and $540 for converting the Office DOS RequesterFeature to OS/2 Office Feature.andP;  But while the very basic Release 1 arrivesin September, with attachment to DisOSS under DOS/VSE following in December,users have to wait until March 1990 for the Real Thing, Release 2, and untila year from now, June 1990, for the decision support function of Release 2.andM;OfficeVision/MVS, OfficeVision/VMandM;Bending over backwards not to make MVS users with DisOSS feel thatandM;they have wasted a fortune on something they will have to throw away now, IBMdescribes the OfficeVision/MVS Series as extending the usability of existingMVS office products to enable evolutionary growth to a Systems ApplicationArchitecture application, with support for MVS/XA and MVS/ESA.andP;  Elements ofthe system are the OfficeVision/MVS with Document Writing, DocumentComposition, Application Connectivity and TSO Application Access features;local network and direct connection for OS/2 Extended Edition workstations;an MS-DOS requester for the OS/2 Office LAN; and an MS-DOS direct connectfeature.andP;  Migration of existing Personal Services/CICS, Application SupportFacility, Integrated Processing of Data and Text, and Personal Managerprograms is offered on payment of upgrade charges.andP;  It is charged on the newup-front plus annual basis and is $15,130 and $2,760 a year, or $860 a month,on a Model Group 18 9370, to $51,000 and $9,000 a year, or $1,815 on a large3090.andP;  Release 1 is out in September, 2 in June 1990.andP;  OfficeVision/VM ispretty much the same as the MVS version - no mention of Profs - and costs$8,500 and $1,500 annually, or $605 a month on a baby 9370, and charges onGroup 18 to Group 50 machines are the same as for MVS.andP;  Dates are December1989 Release 1, March 1990, Release 2.andM;Yes, OfficeVision/400 is AS/400 OfficeandM;As we suggested back last October, OfficeVision/400 is effectivelyandM;a new release of AS/400 Office, with support for OS/2 and MS-DOS workstations- &quot;the existing AS/400 Office will be represented in the OfficeVision Familyas the IBM OfficeVision/400 Series&quot;.andP;  It adds OfficeVision/400 support ofdirectly connected OS/2 Extended Edition boxes running OS/2 Office andsupports the SAA Document Library structure and distribution services.andP;  Andthere is still a one-time charge - $2,885 on a B10, $28,640 on a B70, or youcan pay $1,890 upfront and $335 a year on a B10 to $18,740 and $3,310 a yearon a B70, or you can pay a straight monthly licence of $945 on any AS/400model.andP;  The new release is set for June 1990.andP;  In the meantime, Release 2 ofAS/400 Office with PC Support, Communications and Language Dictionariesavailable in the fourth quarter at the prices above.andM;IBM OfficeVision - AcolytesandM;Mixed batch goes on-line as Interactive Images, Comshare, SynonandM;line up behind IBMandM;Sharing the IBM platform on Tuesday were 14 &quot;business partners&quot;,andM;eager to commit to SAA compliance or announce software products supportingSAA and OfficeVision.andP;  Partners include Interactive Images Inc, Comshare, andSynon Inc.andP;  Interactive, based in Woburn, Massachusetts, was able to providefurther details of Easel, a software program licensed to IBM and marketed viaits Co-operative Software Programme for development use under OS/2 Extended,and a run-time module.andP;  Easel converts 3270 applications into Common UserAccesscompliant frontends for PS/2s, and can also be used as a screen designtool, within CUA- compliant application development.andP;  Additional featuresinclude a high-level language for Cobol programmers and those unfamiliar withC, prototyping capabilities, a nonprocedural objectoriented environment,enabling any part of the screen to be modified with single commands, andmultitasking capabilities, enabling 3developers to run multiple - remote orlocal - applications, concurrently.andP;  Optional application templates andpre-built financial applications are also available.andP;  The one-time charge forthe development software is $7,200; the run-time version costs $295.andP;  IBMsays both products, available on either 3.5&quot; or 5.25&quot; disks, will be out byAugust 25.andP;  For its part, Comshare Inc, Ann Arbor, Michigan, issued astatement of direction, indicating that its Commander EIS/SQL cooperativeprocessing software will comply with SAA.andP;  It also announced that thepartnership agreement signed with IBM last July has been extended for twoyears through to April 1991.andP;  It now encompasses enhancements for the PC-DOSversion, and a new version designed to run under OS/2 Extended Edition.andP;  Theproduct provides &quot;high- level non-technical&quot; users with five businessapplications and news services.andP;  These include Redi-Mail, which currentlyenables users to access Profs for receiving mail and sending EIS screens, andwill provide a similar function for OfficeVision in the future.andP;  No financialdetails, but the company retains product and independent marketing rights.andP;  Athird participant was Synon Inc, which publishes and licenses the Synon/2Ecomputer-aided software engineering automation tool for the AS/400.andP;  Thecompany says the product generates code consistent with the SAA Common UserAccess, and will provide development methods, eight times faster thantraditional ones, for creating SAA-compliant applications in the future.andO;One-time charges, which vary according to tape size and languages, range from$48,000 to $60,000.andP;  Out next week.andM;SAA means hard work for users, Anderson warnsandM;A warning that &quot;taking full advantage of SAA requires companies toandM;consider more than compliant products&quot;, accompanied Andersen Consulting'sTuesday announcement that it will offer SAA- compliant applications andcomputer-aided software engineering tools.andP;  Managing partner Mel Bergsteinsaid the migration would need end users and data processing staff to developnew skills, and added that &quot;management must be committed and focused on thechange in attitude, skills and culture required&quot;.andP;  Bergstein claimed that SAAcould offer companies a better return on investment, a reduction in &quot;missioncritical&quot; development risks, and the means to help staff work &quot;faster,smarter and more accurately&quot;.andP;  However, he argued that it would alsonecessitate additional employee education and training, assistance inimplementation from &quot;outside&quot;, and a combination of application packages,software engineering tools, and external resources.andP;  Andersen describesFoundation, its control and automation tool as &quot;the platform&quot; on which itwill build its range of SAA offerings - DCS/Logistics business distributionmainframe system, Mac-Pac manufacturing, resource planning, and controlsystem, and Mac-Pac for the AS/400.andM;Consumers Software wings in from CanadaandM;On Wednesday, Toronto-based Consumers Software Inc said it hadandM;licensed a version of The Network Courier MS-DOS messaging application foruse with the new OfficeVision/2 range.andP;  Company chief Jack Gruschow says itprovides a CUA-compliant user interface, and will provide MS-DOS micros withaccess to OfficeVision electronic mail.andP;  Under a separate co-operativemarketing agreement with IBM, the software will also sold by IBM acrossCanada, and in 14 regions in the US.andM;Tesseract personnel, Lotus 1-2-3/GandM;Tesseract Corp and Lotus Development Corp also rushed out softwareandM;announcements supporting IBM's new OfficeVision products.andP;  The former, NewYork-based company says that by integrating its HRMS Intuition range ofpayroll, personnel management, and benefits administration software with theOfficeVision products, it will provide consistent, integrated, and simplifiedoffice functions across IBM's major operating environments.andP;  Currently, thesoftware provides users at workstations running under OS/2 Extended Editionwith access to Tesseract's family of mainframe personnel applications, andfeatures a colour graphics, icon-based user interface.andP;  Initial releases willbe available this summer; additional phases are planned later in the year,and throughout 1990.andP;  Prices start at $28,000.andP;  Meanwhile, Lotus has said itwill adapt its 1-2-3/G graphical spreadsheet to exploit OS/2's multi-taskingcapabilities and Presentation Manager user interface.andP;  At the announcement,Lotus also demonstrated 1-2-3/M, a character-based version of the spreadsheetdesigned to run on IBM mainframes, and an example of multi-platformintegration, using Release 3.0 and 1-2-3/G and 1-2-3/M.andP;  No indicationhowever, of cost, availability, or how it would achieve the integration of1-2-3 into the new OfficeVision software.andP;  Although Microsoft demonstratedits Excel in the OS/2 and Presentation Manager environment, it is assumedthat IBM's pre-existing pact with Lotus for an MVS mainframe version of 1-2-3means that gets precedence.andM;Information Builders builds PM/FocusandM;And Information Builders Inc, New York previewed a forthcomingandM;implementation of its Focus language and database for Presentation Manager&quot;at the SAA Office rollout&quot;, the company says - old names die hard!andP;  Thepromise for PM/Focus is co- operative processing and applications portabilityacross graphic environments in a 100% SAA-compliant package, and the companyclaims the package will offer complete database, application development anddecision support capabilities - including reporting, three-dimensionalgraphics, statistics, financial reporting and spreadsheet functions - toPresentation Manager for both PS/2 and AT-bus personal computers, withLU6.2-based co- operative processing between the micro and VM and MVS, andwill work with all major non-Focus database files on all supported machines -initially, SAA-level DB2, OS/400 DBMS and the OS/2 Extended Edition DatabaseManager, with SQL Server, Sybase, Oracle, and Ingres, to follow.andP;  PM/Focus ispromised for second quarter 1990.andP;  Pricing has not yet been set.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
