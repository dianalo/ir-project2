McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government reported Wednesday that itschief economic forecasting gauge plunged last month, taking thedeepest dip since the 1987 stock market crash. But many analystsremained confident the economy is not being steered into a recession.   The 1.2 percent decline in the Index of Leading EconomicIndicators was the steepest since a 1.8 percent dropoff in Novemberl987, the Commerce Department reported. The drop in 1987 reflectedthe shock from the 508-point plunge in the Dow Jones index of 30industrial stocks on Oct. 19, 1987.   Many analysts were expecting a decline _ although perhaps not assteep _ and said it was consistent with the so-called soft landingsought by the Federal Reserve as it seeks to stem inflation byslowing the economy without driving it into recession.   The index is designed to foretell economic activity six to ninemonths into the future.   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said of the drop:``The economy is healthy and growing at a slower pace, which meansless pressure on inflation and interest rates. We still think thatthe economy is in very good shape.''   Undersecretary of Commerce Michael R. Darby told reporters: ``Ithink the Federal Reserve has been aiming at more moderate growthand it has been successful in achieving that this spring.''   Other economists agreed.   ``Although the numbers came in a bit lower than expected, I stillthink the Fed is on track for a soft landing,'' said David Wyss,senior financial economist of Data Resources Inc., in Lexington,Mass.   However, analysts such as Wyss and Lawrence Chimerine, senioreconomic adviser for the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., alsoexpressed concern that the Fed not overtighten its grip on theeconomy.   ``While again I think we'll avoid a recession, certainly we'llhave to watch the next couple of months very carefully,'' Chimerinesaid.   There have been signs recently that the Fed has been easinginterest rates, and some economists anticipate further easing as theeconomy continues to slow.   ``I don't expect a discount rate cut,'' Wyss said, ``but I doexpect to see interest rates moving down further due to other Fedaction. The slower economic growth is getting impressive enough thatthey will want to loosen again.''   The May decline was the third in four months. The index fell 0.3percent in February and 0.6 percent in March but rose 0.6 percent inApril, thus allowing the index to steer clear of the traditionalsignal of a forthcoming recession _ three consecutive monthlydeclines.   While a three-month drop has preceded all eight recessions since1948, there also have been five similar series of declines _including the five consecutive months surrounding the 1987 stockmarket crash _ that were not followed by recessions.   Only two of the forward-looking business statistics that make upthe composite index moved up in May: higher stock prices andincreased building permits.   The others moved down: a drop in the money supply; lower pricesfor sensitive materials, indicating slower demand; the fourthconsecutive drop in an index measuring consumer confidence; fastervendor deliveries, meaning declining demand; a shorter average workweek; fewer orders for plants and equipment; a decrease inmanufacturers' unfilled orders; higher initial claims for joblessbenefits; and a decrease in manufacturers' new orders.   The various changes left the index at 143.8 percent of its 1982base of 100. So far this year, the index has declined at an annualrate of 2 percent, compared with an increase of 4.5 percent for allof 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
