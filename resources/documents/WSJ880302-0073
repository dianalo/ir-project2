They also will ponder whether the INF treaty has initiated a &quot;decoupling&quot; of America from Europe's defense.    Both major issues could be illuminated by confronting an immediate practical problem: finding a new home for the 72 American F-16s that NATO-member Spain decided in January to boot out of its country. The planes have a key role in NATO strategy; in case of war, the nuclear-capable F-16s would cover the eastern Mediterranean, using bases in Italy, Greece and Turkey.    Britain's Margaret Thatcher is known to be deeply concerned that the alliance countries are becoming too complacent about their relationship with the Soviet Union. And indeed after Spain's decision on the F-16s, General Secretary Gorbachev has wasted no opportunity to praise Premier Felipe Gonzales for boosting the country's &quot;prestige in international affairs.&quot; Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze even flew to Madrid to pave the way for a Gorbachev visit and to set up a Kremlin hot line.    The best response to this discouraging activity would be a commitment to find a new home for basing the Air Force's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing. The Italian government of Premier Goria has indicated a willingness to base the planes. A likely location would be Comiso in Sicily, the site of the cruise missiles that are to be eliminated -- not without economic dislocation to the region -- as a result of the INF treaty. Despite real economic and political problems, Italy by some GDP measures outstrips Britain and France in size. Italy could afford to base the planes without feeling it has to blackmail the U.S. for aid handouts. Moreover, accepting the F-16s would be a further strong sign that Italy is moving rapidly toward a primary role in international policy formation.    The Soviets of course don't want an easy solution to NATO's basing crisis and have been quick to exploit political turmoil in Rome. The Italian Communists have led the opposition parties in a determined effort to scuttle the basing proposal. Even Italy's relatively hardheaded socialist leader, Bettino Craxi, described the idea as unfitting in the year of the INF treaty. The Soviet Union claims that putting the F-16s in Italy would be to the Kremlin's detriment because the bombers would move closer to Warsaw Pact countries -- hardly a reason for not doing it.    A timely, forceful decision on basing the F-16s would reaffirm NATO's commitment to collective deterrence and deny Mr. Gorbachev a political victory. </TEXT></DOC>
