The 15,000 potentially hazardous strollers were identified asmodel 1601 PRT strollers that were sold between August 1986 andMarch 1987 at Service Merchandise stores.   The strollers are navy blue with red trim. Each stroller has 16tube end plugs that may dislodge and choke a small child who triesto swallow the plugs, the CPSC said.   ``In addition, when the plugs are removed, the exposed metaltube ends could have sharp edges,'' the commission said.   Parents using the strollers ``should stop using them andimmediately contact Service Merchandise for a modification kit,''it said.   The commission said it had received no reports of small childrenbeing injured as a result of the plugs or sharp edges, but theNashville-based Service Merchandise Co. is voluntarily offering themodification kits to customers at no charge.   To get the kit, consumers should call 1-800-251-1389. Tennesseeresidents should call 1-800-251-1212.</TEXT></DOC>
