Noreiga did virtually declare war with the United States Friday,and his actions in the next few days were troubling. But, while wedo not mean to belittle anyone's life, only one U.S. citizen waskilled before the invasion. ...   And while Wednesday's well-orchestrated events began with theswearing-in of a democratic government, our invasion made it ourgovernment, in a sense our puppet. And yet, deep inside, we have agut feeling that justice just might have been served. ...   We should be humble and perhaps even a little ashamed we had toresort to violence. But Noriega by all accounts did deserve to beousted and should be brought to trial. In that light, perhaps amore apt comparison than the invasion of Czechoslovakia may be thekilling in Romania. Would we protest if Soviet President Gorbachevinvaded Romania to put a stop to the killing there?</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 24   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on the Panama invasion:   President Bush's decision to invade Panama, we're certain, willbe well received by the American people. His popularity rating willshoot upward.   This is the president who has been criticized for being toocautious and too prudent _ a wimp, some have called him. Now he'splaying Rambo.   Few nations are applauding. U.S. might does not necessarily meanright, despite the fact that Noriega was a disreputable dictatorwho pushed his luck too far and who should have been dumped.   But many Americans do not properly appreciate the sensitivity ofthe Latin Americans to intervention by Uncle Sam. The Latins have aname for it _ gunboat diplomacy.   The United States has no legal or moral right to intervene inthe affairs of independent nations.   ... In this case, Noriega made it easy for Bush.   In retrospect, we wonder why our government made it so hard forNoriega to step down peaceably. Why did we insist that he be triedon drug charges? ... We should have eased him out, cajoled andpersuaded him to resign, then slipped him away to exile.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 25   The Birmingham (Ala.) News on the Panama invasion:   Panama may have lost a tinhorn dictator last week, but in thenear future it will gain about $375 million in assets andmulti-millions more in back taxes from U.S. companies.   Looks like a pretty good swap from here.   The United States cut off all military and economic aid toPanama in July 1987 in an attempt to force Manuel Noriega frompower.   Further sanctions sharply restricted U.S. companies that dobusiness in Panama, froze Panamanian assets held in the UnitedStates, held payments relating to operating the Panama Canal inescrow and forbade American companies from paying taxes and fees tothe Noriega regime.   But those sanctions probably hurt the poor people of Panama morethan Noriega.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
