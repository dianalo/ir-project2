The attorneys sent a notice of the abortion to the IndianaSupreme Court one day after asking the high court Tuesday for animmediate review of a Vigo Circuit Court injunction to prohibit anabortion.   Attorneys for both the woman and her 24-year-old boyfriend, whosought the injunction, said they still want the Supreme Court tomake a decision on the issues raised by the case. The couple arefrom Terre Haute. Their names are withheld in court records becausethe case involves a paternity action.   ``Faced with the decision of continuing with an unwantedpregnancy and with violating a court order, she made the decisionshe felt was right,'' said the notice signed by Richard A. Waples,an Indiana Civil Liberties Union attorney who represented theunmarried woman.   ``She arrived at the decision to terminate her pregnancy afterconsultation with her family and her physician,'' the statementsaid. ``She did what she had to do to protect both her physical andemotional health.''   James Bopp Jr., who represents the man who claims to be thefather of the fetus, said his client ``is absolutely devastatedthat his child has been taken from him.''   Bopp said he and his client haven't thought about whether theywould want Vigo Circuit Court Judge Robert H. Brown to issue acontempt citation against the woman for violating Brown'sinjunction. Brown issued a permanent injunction on Monday.   ``He loves this girl,'' Bopp said of his client. ``He's notinterested in punishing her.''   However, in a brief filed with the Supreme Court, Bopp arguedthat a violation of the injunction should be punishable by acontempt of court citation.   Waples told the court he wants it to review the case because ofthe issues involved, the precedent set by Brown's injunction andpotential sanctions against the woman.   If allowed to stand, Brown's ruling invites ``other Indianacourts to engage in the same pernicious and impermissible inquiryinto, and overruling of, a competent adult woman's decision toterminate her first trimester pregnancy,'' Waples told the court.   The woman's attorneys said her first trimester would have endedsometime during the next two weeks. The attorneys would not divulgedetails of when or where the abortion was performed.   Waples argued Brown's decision violates the 1973 U.S. SupremeCourt ruling in Roe vs. Wade, which upheld a woman's right to anabortion during the first three months of a pregnancy.   Bopp, who is also a general counsel for the national Right toLife organization, said he wants a court decision detailing whatrights a father has in such cases.   ``Fathers have rights in particular cases. All we said in thiscase is we want those rights to be balanced'' against the rights ofthe mother, Bopp said.   Bobb told the Supreme Court ``the mother's reasons for wantingan abortion are the result of an immature reasoning process, areinsubstantial and border on the frivolous, and do not outweigh thestrong interests of the father in seeing the child born and in hiscustody.''   Bopp's brief described the woman as an unemployed high schooldropout who began a relationship with the man, a delivery truckdriver, following a date on New Year's Eve.   According to the brief, Brown's ruling noted testimony that thewoman wanted an abortion to preserve her figure so she would lookgood in a bathing suit and to keep from being pregnant during thesummer.</TEXT></DOC>
