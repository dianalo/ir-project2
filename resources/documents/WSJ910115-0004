The Iraqis, he says somberly, &quot;have made thousands ofnew coffins and shipped them to Kuwait.&quot; Then, spotting anAmerican visitor, the merchant reclaims his bravado andquips, &quot;Of course, the coffins are for your soldiers.&quot;   With war possibly just hours away, Baghdad is an eerieblend of public grit and private desperation. As theEducation Ministry announces plans for midyear exams,families pack children off to stay with rural relatives.Iraqis parrot the bellicose words of Saddam Hussein, thennervously tune in the Voice of America to find out what'sreally happening.</LP><TEXT>   At the Iraqi Museum, workers pack the last of a200,000-piece collection into metal crates. The &quot;GreatMesopotamian Exhibition,&quot; originally destined for six U.S.cities, has gone instead to a bunker. But for Iraq'santiquities director, Muayad Damerji, such precautions areroutine; he evacuated the museum three times during Iraq'slong war with Iran. &quot;War is at the door and nobody cares,&quot; hesays. &quot;It's normal for Iraqis.&quot;   This widespread sang-froid has two main sources: a beliefthat eight years of war has hardened Iraq for any battle, andthe perhaps wishful thinking that American willpower willcrumble. Most Iraqis still feel the U.S. won't dare to takethem on, or that its resolve will evaporate when the firstbody bag is sent back. Failing that, many genuinely believewhat Saddam Hussein has repeatedly told them: Iraq's arsenaland the experience of its soldiers make the countryinvincible.   &quot;There is a difference between those who only saw thefilms of Rambo and those who have actually fought wars,&quot; theIraqi president declared in a warlike broadcast at 1 a.m.yesterday.   His confidence resonates through the Iraqi bureaucracy.When one of the last diplomats remaining here went to theforeign ministry to say he was leaving, the halls soon filledwith incredulous officials, asking why he was fleeing. &quot;Theyare waiting for the expected, inevitable miracle to happen,&quot;the diplomat says, frantically packing his bags.   Even as diplomats fled en masse last weekend, Iraqis stillblithely recited a list of possible saviors: the U.S.Congress, European intervention and the visit of UnitedNations Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar. As each ofthese hopes has faded, Iraqis who do expect war have fallenback on a contradictory faith: in the American character, andin the accuracy of U.S. weapons.   &quot;Americans are very humane -- they will bomb objects, notpeople,&quot; says Mohammed al-Said, who studied at GrinnellCollege in Iowa and kept an American pen pal for 45 years.Told that the U.S. may hit Iraq with 2,000 bombing sorties aday, the merchant shrugs. &quot;The closest military target ismany blocks from here,&quot; he says, turning to greet anothercustomer.   Not everyone is so sanguine. Perhaps the most obvious signof quiet anguish is Iraqis' sudden eagerness to spill outtheir feelings to foreigners. In this iron-fisted society,such contact with outsiders was, until recently, almostunthinkable.   A Baghdad engineer has begun driving taxis at night toearn enough money to stockpile food and fuel. Puttering alongin his cousin's dilapidated cab, he quickly confesses: &quot;I amweeping inside. Only the dumb ones are not afraid.&quot;   Making an illegal turn, he barely escapes hitting anothercar head-on. Accidents and near-misses have become morefrequent here. &quot;All Baghdad is out of its mind,&quot; he says,pulling over to stop trembling. Even lapsed Muslims likehimself, he adds, &quot;now go to the mosque.&quot;   Or to the races. At the Baghdad Horsemanship Club, severalthousand men swig beer and study scratch sheets as thefavorite, Ruthless, bounds out of the gate in the fifth race.At the stretch, a longshot named Emir pulls ahead by severallengths to win and a groan rises from the crowd.   &quot;This is a bad sign,&quot; jokes Yussef Entoni, a retired mathprofessor. &quot;Emirs are for Kuwait and the Gulf states. Wedon't like them in Iraq.&quot;   The attitude toward war at the track, and at nightclubsand restaurants still catering to a lively trade, is one ofalmost total denial. Hassan Abdul Karim recalls sitting inthe racetrack grandstand four years ago and watching a crudeIranian missile plunge into downtown Baghdad. &quot;We shook ourheads and went to bet on the next race,&quot; he says. &quot;It will bethe same this time.&quot;   But at the U.S. Embassy, amid bales of shredded documents,consular official Bob Kandra warned that this war might notbe the same at all. &quot;You want to stick around and become apound of ground round?&quot; he asked, urging American journaliststo join him a few hours later on the embassy's charteredplane. The embassy received a barrage of last-minute callsfrom others wanting to fly out, including a query from anAmerican who had been living, with a handful of otherpacifists, in a &quot;peace camp&quot; near the Iraq-Saudi bordersymbolically designed to block hostilities.   By yesterday, the diplomatic quarter of Baghdad was avirtual ghost town. Within hours of the failed talks inGeneva last week, the German ambassador stunned thediplomatic community by slipping out of Baghdad withoutalerting either Iraqi officials or fellow envoys. At the71-year-old British Club, there are now no takers for thesteak and kidney pies, or players at the dart boards hangingbeside pictures of Queen Elizabeth. &quot;We had one personyesterday&quot; -- the last U.N. representative -- says thebarman, Gyorgis Yacub, playing billiards with the doorman.&quot;Today, nobody.&quot;   In his half-packed living room, a Mideast diplomat drags ahand through his hair and speaks desolately about hisdeparture. &quot;I am paid to stop wars. This means I failed. Thereins are passing from our hands to the hands of thegenerals. When we get them back, after the last bullet isfired, we'll have a big heap of dung to clean out.&quot;   His review of the five months of crisis becomes a litanyof what he feels are the allied coalition's errors: theex-statesmen and celebrities coming to &quot;apple-polish Saddam&quot;by pleading for the hostages, the unconvincing wording ofU.N. resolutions, the proliferation of separate peace plansand the on-again, off-again attitude to a U.S.-Iraqi meeting.Since Aug. 2, he says, &quot;Saddam hasn't taken one stepbackwards but we were dancing all the time. So far, we'vealways taken a step aside. That's why we are here now --because Iraq is still expecting the same thing.&quot;   The emptying of embassies, though, hasn't halted theritual of Iraqi demonstrations. A few hours after the lastAmerican envoys flew out of Baghdad, 400 schoolchildren setoff for yet another protest, carrying posters of SaddamHussein.   &quot;Today was our turn,&quot; says Suhail Abdullah, an Englishteacher, surprised to find the embassy vacant and the starsand stripes removed to avoid desecration. Undeterred, heraises a baton to coach his pupils in three precise words ofEnglish: &quot;No More War.&quot; A boy named Omar removes a lollipopfrom his mouth just long enough to join the chant beforescattering with his friends.   &quot;Boys are boys. They go to play,&quot; says Mr. Abdullah. Buthe says many students are afraid. &quot;At home they hear theirparents say that everyone may soon be dust.&quot;   That certainly isn't the message coming from Iraqiofficials. Editorials in the government-controlled presspromise &quot;crushed bones spread in the desert&quot; and &quot;a marsh ofblood,&quot; in which the corpses of the &quot;American invaders&quot; willswim. At an Islamic conference over the weekend, the tone wasso extreme that the American Muslim Louis Farrakhan foundhimself in the unfamiliar role of moderate. &quot;People are veryresolute about this holy war thing, but we're not sure that'sthe way to go,&quot; says a spokesman for the minister, whoadvocates instead a peaceful &quot;Islamic&quot; solution.   The loud rhetoric contrasts with the quiet preparationsfor war in Baghdad, which still presents a generally tranquilface. Many windows are crisscrossed with masking tape toprevent flying glass, and boat landings are being laid incase Tigris River bridges are bombed. But there are novisible sandbags and few new anti-aircraft emplacements. Onthe road south of Baghdad, military police flag down civilianbuses to commandeer them for troop transport. The price ofused cars has shot up 50% as people prepare to flee Baghdad,many for the holy cities of Kerbala and Najaf, which Iraqisbelieve are unlikely to be bombed.   The low-key preparations suggest to some Iraqis thatSaddam Hussein might yet engineer a last-minute pullback. Hewould face little dissent from his cowed citizenry. &quot;Kuwaitis our country,&quot; says Mohamed Hamzah, a newspaper editor,&quot;but the Iraqi people will support Saddam Hussein in anythinghe does.&quot;   Including war. Hamzah Shakir was shot in the back in thefinal days of the Iran-Iraq war and has taken up portraitpainting since leaving the hospital. He still winces in paineach time he rises from his stool. At 25, he is one of thefew young men in Baghdad still out of uniform, and he fearsfor his two brothers at the Kuwaiti front. But asked if hethinks Iraq can prevail in a war with America, Mr. Shakirgestures at a just-finished painting of the president. &quot;IfSaddam says we will win,&quot; the painter says quietly, &quot;we mustbelieve we will win.&quot;   Trapped in Iraq by a government ban on overseas travel,Iraqis have little choice but to hang in and hope for thebest. Among those still in the country as of last weekendwere at least 100 U.S. citizens, mostly dual nationals orspouses of Iraqis who have chosen to stay.   Patrick Trigg was one Westerner who had despaired ofgetting out. As a long line formed to board what was rumoredto be the last plane out of Baghdad, the gaunt Welshmananxiously fingered worry beads as an Iraqi official eyed hisdocuments. An Iraqi judge had released Mr. Trigg from prisonjust hours before, acquitting him of trying to escape acrossthe border last September. He had spent 120 days in solitaryconfinement and was told he would be sentenced to death. Hecredits his deliverance to St. Jude, the patron-saint ofhopeless cases.   &quot;I didn't know the other hostages had been released, orthat Margaret Thatcher was gone,&quot; says the 54-year-oldpipeline worker. Despite his ordeal, he still feels warmlytoward individual Iraqis. At one point he was blindfolded andtaken for what he thought was another interrogation. Instead,a prison guard produced a Christmas cake the guard's wife hadbaked, with a candle at the center. &quot;We sat around and sangHappy Birthday to Jesus.&quot;   Last week, when a priest was finally allowed to visit, hepromised to offer Sunday's Mass as a prayer for Mr. Trigg'srelease. When the newly freed Welshman walked in midwaythrough the service, the priest looked up and said: &quot;Ourprayer has just been answered.&quot;   A 37-year-old Iraqi named Ali is still waiting for theanswer to his prayers. Early yesterday, as a hard rain fellon Baghdad, Ali drove slowly through the empty streets,contemplating his return later that morning to an artilleryunit outside the city. Having fought in the Iran-Iraq war, hedreads the coming conflict. &quot;If war comes, I kill manypeople. My piece,&quot; he says, miming the recoil of his cannon,&quot;I don't know where it lands.&quot;   He doesn't want war, but won't shirk his duty. &quot;It is mycountry,&quot; he says with a resigned shrug. &quot;What can I do?&quot;   Like so many Iraqis, he is fatalistic rather than afraid.Gesturing at his car radio, he translates the lyrics for hispassenger. &quot;Iraqi song -- it say: `It is up to the God.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
