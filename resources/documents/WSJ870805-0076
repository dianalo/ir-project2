Levine, the government yesterday opened the first such case it has had to prove before a jury since 1985.    Howard Wilson, chief of the criminal division in the U.S. attorney's office, began describing in a packed federal courtroom the government's case against Israel G. Grossman, a 34-year-old lawyer at Kramer, Levin, Nessen, Kamin andamp; Frankel.    Mr. Grossman is accused of stealing inside information from the firm about Colt Industries Inc., helping himself and six others make $1.5 million on an investment in Colt options of $33,000.    &quot;The evidence will show a family money tree&quot; that grew after Mr. Grossman &quot;took advantage of what was a golden opportunity to make a lot of money,&quot; Mr. Wilson told the seven-woman, five-man jury in his opening statement. He predicted a short trial. Jury selection took nearly two days.    Irving P. Seidman, Mr. Grossman's attorney, sought to play down the government's case and separate his client from stock speculators such as Ivan F. Boesky, who pleaded guilty to a felony charge and paid $100 million to settle civil charges of insider trading.    &quot;Israel Grossman has about as much to do with Ivan Boesky as I have to do with being an astronaut,&quot; Mr. Seidman said.    Mr. Levine's arrest and guilty plea last year led to a series of major insider-trading cases, including Mr. Boesky's. But none of the cases arising from that investigation has yet resulted in a trial, because most defendants have pleaded guilty. In 1985, Thomas C. Reed, a former presidential adviser, was acquitted of such charges in another case.    Mr. Grossman was one of seven lawyers in Kramer Levin's pension department last year when Colt's pension-plan trustees retained the firm. Mr. Wilson said Mr. Grossman was the only lawyer in the department on duty at the time who wasn't assigned to Colt. But he said another associate will testify that he told Mr. Grossman what he was working on. Also, Mr. Wilson said Kramer Levin's &quot;unique computer system&quot; will help him show that Mr. Grossman made more than 40 calls to relatives right before Colt announced a recapitalization plan that made its stock soar.    Though the government had previously indicated it would rely on circumstantial evidence to prove its case, Mr. Wilson said he will call as a key witness David Lev, a brother-in-law of a Grossman cousin. He said Mr. Lev has admitted lying to the Securities and Exchange Commission about where he got his stock information, but has been given immunity from prosecution in order to testify for the government. </TEXT></DOC>
