This polarized ion source was basedon the electron-capture reactions of H/sup +/ ions with electron-spinpolarized sodium atoms which are optically pumped by dye laser. In orderto get an intense beam current with high polarization, it is importantto obtain a thick sodium target with high polarization. A long-pulsed(andgt; 100 {mu}sec) flash-lamp-pumped dye laser with a peak power of morethan 300 W was developed. With this laser, more than 60 mA H/sup -/ ioncurrent with 60 % polarization has been obtained so far. As for the accelerationof the polarized beam in the 500-MeV booster and the 12-GeV Main Ring,there are many depolarization resonances due to the betatron oscillationsand closed-orbit-distortions. With spin-flip and fast tune-jump techniqueto overcome the depolarization resonance, we have succeeded in the accelerationof the polarized beam of more than 1 x 10/sup 9/ ppp up to 3.5 GeV with45 % polarization so far.</TEXT></DOC>
