 Currently, it is in use within Xerox andamong a select, early-adopter, customer set.andM;By the time you read this, Xerox should be announcing it for generalavailability, albeit with a different name.andP;  As you'll read later in thisreport, we think SVP is a very strong and innovative offering from a companywith a heritage of advanced development.andM;But if the application offerings are so powerful and the networking is soadvanced, why it is that Xerox hasn't swamped the world?andM;A variety of factors is at work retarding Xerox's advance.andP;  Being ahead ofthe market in many areas, Xerox never seemed to listen well to the marketnoise in the pack in its wake.andP;  It pursued its own path without properreality-checking along the way.andP;  As a result, its systems are advanced, butproprietary.andP;  Clearly, the proprietary nature of the network and theworkstations is a factor in the overall performance of the company.andP;  Usersthese days don't want to hear about proprietary hardware, operating systems,or applications.andM;That last point raises an interesting discussion.andP;  The reason ViewPoint andStructured ViewPoint can function as they do is that they are built upon acommon, consistent object model which happens to be specific to theenvironment.andP;  (Metaphor, another Xerox-inspired company, is also an exampleof a similar advanced, closed environment).andP;  Try to integrate shrink-wrappedapplications at the same level of functionally, and you find that you can't,of course.andP;  Applications have to be written to exploit the platform.andO;OfficeVision will find itself in the same quandary.andP;  The only way around thedichotomy between advanced function and open systems is to have anacknowledged, adopted industry standard at the sytem level (which is what theOMG is trying to promote).andM;For some users, the current advanced application environment embodied byViewPoint is offset by the proprietary nature of the solution.andP;  Xerox isattacking this in three main ways: organizationally, functionally, andarchitecturally.andM;Organizationally, Xerox has created its Integrated Systems Operation (ISO) topursue, among other things, its strategy of selling cooperative solutions forteamwork under the umbrella name of Collaborative Systems Support.andP;  Initialmarket reaction to this focused effort has been extremely positive.andP;  ISOexceeded its goals last year.andM;Second, Xerox has greatly augmented the functionality of the ViewPointenvironment with Structured ViewPoint.andP;  SVP makes it much more than aninteresting object-oriented system.andP;  SVP is addressing some fundamental needsof group computing and doing so in a very powerful and elegant way.andP;  Webelieve that the SVP functionality will give Xerox the sales boost it islooking for.andM;Third, Xerox is acknowledging the din for standards.andP;  The company is in theprocess of moving ViewPoint over to the Sun Unix platform (running on XNS).andO;A future complete migration away from XNS to TCP/IP and OSI is underlong-term consideration.andP;  In the meantime, though, Xerox is stressing theservices it offers for bridging XNS with TCP/IP and OSI (as well as SNA andPC LANs).andM;For example, the TCP/IP gateway provides a basis for interoperability betweenthe two environments by currently offering mail and file exchange (along withterminal emulation from the ViewPoint environment).andM;XNS PC Plus 2.0 integrates XNS and NETBIOS, and enables file exchange betweenPC servers and XNS servers.andP;  Remote PCs can access XNS network resources.andO;Also, Xerox offers a 386 companion card for the 6085.andM;Furthermore, as an interim solution until the Sun port is complete, Xeroxwill be offering a next-generation 6085, with a noticeable performanceimprovement.andM;None of this is the same as being based on a standard foundation, of course.andO;But Xerox is betting that many customers will opt for the functionality ofSVP over the somewhat slow open systems record in the short term.andP;  For themedium term, Xerox plans to port XNS over to the Sun platform.andP;  Long term,Xerox plans to offer the same type of support for open systems as the rest ofthe world.andM;In some cases, the company will have bet correctly.andP;  We believe that the typeof group application support offered by SVP together with XNS is exemplary.andO;Once again, Xerox is leading the industry with a technology solution.andP;  ForXerox's sake, we hope that it continues on its current course ofaccommodating the demand for open systems.andP;  For the industry's sake, we'reextremely glad to see Structured ViewPoint.andP;  It provides an excellent exampleof the types of distributed network solutions we can anticipate.andM;Xerox BackgroundandM;Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) generated many seminal developmentsfor this current shift to distributed network computing during the 1970s.andO;The Alto project, begun in 1971, produced a personal workstation with abit-mapped display, a mouse, and an interface to the Xerox-developed EthernetLAN.andM;The PARC scientists recognized that the standalone Alto was inadequate formany of the applications for which it was intended.andP;  Application developersneeded to share source and object code; office application users needed toshare documents and files, to communicate with one another, and to sharenetwork resources.andP;  The Alto became the basis for a variety of experimentalnetwork services, including a file system and a directory service.andM;Throughout the '70s, PARC researchers worked on workstation applications andnetwork services (coming up with, among other things, laser printing).andM;In the '80s, Xerox decided to try to commercialize the Alto concept and topush even further ahead into research in distributed systems.andP;  In 1981, Xeroxlaunched the Star (The Serox 8100 Information System).andP;  The Star developers(a group separate from PARC, although heavily staffed with PARC researchers)spent a great deal of effort creating an object-oriented user interface thatwould support direct manipulation.andP;  As part of the Star effort, Xerox had todevelop new network protocols and data-encoding schemes.andP;  Whether for good orill, the Star development group was split between two geographic locations,and it looked to the technology of distributed computing to bridge the gap.andM;Two of the many important research efforts Xerox PARC also began in the late'70s and early '80s were Grapevine and Cedar.andP;  Grapevine was a distributedlocal and wide area mail system that managed mail delivery and provided userswith a high degree of transparency.andP;  From the Grapevine effort came the XeroxClearinghouse (CHS) Directory Service -- one of Xerox's current NetworkServices products.andP;  The Cedar project was intended to develop a distributeddevelopment environment.andM;Although the Star impressed the press and analysts at NCC '81 (where it firstappeared in public), it fared less well in the market.andP;  The Star (like itspredecessor, the Alto) was closed and monolithic.andP;  Xerox began a rewrite ofthe Star software.andP;  The new software relied on the utilization of strictprotocols for interapplication data transfer, thus making applicationsindependent of one another.andP;  With the addition of a new hardware platform(the 6085 workstation), Xerox announced ViewPoint 1.0 in 1985.andP;  Several yearslater, Xerox followed up with ViewPoint 2.0, which added new applications anda function called Shared Books for group support for shared documents.andP;  Inits original form, Shared Books was little more than a shared network volume.andO;With the release of Structured ViewPoint, however, Xerox is delivering acompletely revamped Shared Book facility with greatly enhanced functionality.andM;It is important to note that, for nearly 20 years, Xerox and Xerox PARC havebeen beavering away on developing workstation-based distributed solutions.andO;As part of this effort, they developed networking, client/serverarchitectures, and an application suite very much ahead of what other vendorswere doing.andP;  With hindsight, the decision Xerox made to keep it allproprietary in the hopes of gaining and maintaning a competitive edge wasclearly the wrong one.andP;  However, the Structured ViewPoint environmentreflects the thousands of programmer/user-years of experience embodied in theproduct.andP;  The Structured ViewPoint software itself was some eight years ingestation.andP;  The resulting distributed computing solution is exemplary in itsinteraction with the end user, if not yet in its openness.andM;Network FoundationandM;XNS.andP;  Xerox's proprietary network architecture and protocols are called XNS-- Xerox Network Systems.andP;  Although the XNS protocol suite is consistent withthe OSI model, it is not based on it.andP;  Actually, it's the other way around.andO;The XNS layered approach served as some of the inspiration for OSI stackdesign.andP;  (See Illustration 1.)andM;Xerox developed XNS specifically for LANs, with the intention of maximizingperformance.andP;  Since a LAN tends to transmit data more reliably than a WAN,for example, Xerox reduced the amount of error-checking required by upperlevel protocols.andP;  This high performance made it attractive for the PC LANvendors.andP;  NetWare, 3Com's 3+, and Ungermann-Bass's NetOne all use versions ofthe XNS Internetwork Datagram Protocol (IDP) and Sequenced Packet Protocol(SPP).andM;XNS offers fewer discrete levels than does OSI; Xerox groups the functions ofsome layers together for convenience.andP;  However, there is functionalcorrespondence with the OSI stack.andP;  XNS is quite open with respect tomultiple transmission protocols, different types of communications services,and multiple application protocols.andP;  It is in the richness of the upperlayers that XNS demonstrates its maturity.andP;  It is also interesting to notethat many of the functional areas the OSF is considering for its DistributedComputing Environment (OSF DCE) are encompassed with XNS and have been provenoperationally on a very large scale for a decade.andM;The lowest layer (level 0) of XNS, the Physical, defines the LAN interfaceand maps to layers 1 and 2 of the OSI model.andP;  Level 0 protocols handle thephysical transmission of data from point to point, just as the OSIcounterparts do.andP;  Xerox invented Ethernet, which is the obvious XNS level 0protocol.andP;  However, XNS also supports X.21, RS-232-C, RS-449, and theSynchronous Point-to-Point Protocol (SPPP) as transmission protocols.andM;Level 1, Internet Transport, is equivalent to OSI levels 3 and 4, the Networkand Transport layers.andP;  The XNS IDP handles the internet source anddestination addressing.andM;XNS defines five protocols and packet types to handle one of two basicfunctions at the Interprocess Communications level: system management anddata transfer.andP;  These protocols sit atop the IDP service and controlretransmission, sequencing, flow control, and the sharing of information forroute-building.andP;  The system management and control protocols are the ErrorProtocol, the Echo Protocol, and the Routing Information Protocol (RIP).andP;  Thedata transfer service protocols are the Sequenced Packet Protocol (SPP) andthe Packet Exchange Protocol (PEP).andP;  As an example of the seminal role playedby XNS in LANs, note that Novell's SPX (Sequenced Packet Exchange) is avariant of SPP, and the IPX (Internet Packet Exchange) is derived from IDP.andM;Level 2, Resource Control, defines protocols that work with the content ofdata and the control and manipulation of resources, and that correspond tolayers 5 and 6 (Session and Presentation) in the OSI model.andP;  The CourierProtocol (Remote Procedure Call) in level 2 uses lower levels to provideapplications with remote function and execution services.andP;  The Clearinghouse(CHS) Directory Service uses Courier, for example.andP;  A Bulk Data Transfer(BDT) Protocol supports the transfer of larger blocks of data than theCourier RPC can genrally handle.andP;  This level corresponds to the OSI Sessionand Presentation layers (5 and 6).andP;  Higher level protocols in level 2correspond to layer 7 in OSI.andM;The fourth level (level 3) maps to the OSI Application layer.andP;  XNS definesthree Application layer categories: Information Format and EncodingStandards, Basic application Services, and the Application SupportEnvironment.andM;The Application Support Environment contains the Clearinghouse Protocol, theAuthentication Protocol, and the Time Protocol, as well as Font and CharacterCode standards.andP;  Basic Application Services include the Printing Protocol,the Filing Protocol, the Mail Transport Protocol, and the Gateway AccessProtocol for internetworking.andP;  Information Format and Encoding Standardsinclude Xerox's Interpress and Interscript, the Mail format, and a fasterencoding standard.andM;COURIER.andP;  The Courier Protocol defines a remote procedure call (RPC) methodfor distributed application work within XNS.andP;  The Courier RPC defines asingle request-response discipline for higher level application protocols(such as mail).andM;Internally, Courier has three hierarchical layers: the block stream at thebottom, the object stream in the middle, and the message stream at the top(see Illustration 2).andP;  The block stream carries arbitrary binary data inaccordance with the SPP.andP;  The object stream layer carries structured data,and the message stream carries service requests and replies.andP;  Courierreceives input from a user process or application as a message stream, andthen translates this to the appropriate lower level syntax.andP;  Although avariety of RPC mechanisms offers this type of functionality now, Courierprovided a welcome relief to coding for sockets when it first appeared.andM;Xerox, as an early implementer of compound documents, recognized that usingthe argument within a procedure call for bulk data transfer (e.g., a compounddocument) would be inefficient.andP;  To meet the needs of thisless-transaction-oriented type of exchange, Xerox adapted Courier to providea Bulk Data Transfer Protocol as well (see Illustration 3).andM;Conceptually, the bulk data transfer involves three parties: the initiatingrequester, the responding server, and the consuming client.andP;  Often, thelatter is the same as the initiator.andP;  The Bulk Data Transfer Protocolsupports three types of transfer: third-party, immediate, and null.andM;A third-party bulk data transfer might involve a workstation requesting theprinting of a file from a file server, for example.andP;  The workstationinitiates the request for a file, the file server produces the file, and theprinter &quot;consumes&quot; it for output.andP;  To support this mode of transfer, Courierhas special &quot;Produce&quot; and &quot;Consume&quot; procedure calls.andP;  The sender or thereceiver in a third-party bulk transfer can be an active element.andM;In the example above, the initiator issues a Produce and a Consume call.andP;  Thereceiver, which is the active controlling party in this scenario, issues abulk data transfer call to the server, which is passive.andP;  The servertransmits the bulk data and issues a return message to the receiver.andO;Finally, both server and receiver issue returns to the initiator.andM;A simpler case is the immediate transfer, where the initiator is therequester or the receiver.andM;APPLICATION SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT.andP;  Xerox has well-established supportservices, of which solutions such as Structured ViewPoint (SVP) takeadvantage.andP;  Among the most prominent services are:andM;* The Clearinghouse Directory ServiceandM;* The Authentication ServiceandM;* The Time ServiceandM;* A common character-encoding system, standard Fonts, and font servicesandM;CLEARINGHOUSE.andP;  The Clearinghouse Service maintains a database of objects.andO;Each object consists of a name and a set of data items encoding the object'sproperties.andP;  Clients provide Clearinghouse with the name, and Clearinghouseresponds with the requisite address information.andP;  Naming in clearinghousefollows the LocalName:Domain:Organization convention familiar to many usersthrough the XNS-derived PC LAN platforms.andP;  Currently, a Clearinghouse domainsupports  200 to 300 users and associated resources.andM;Clearinghouse maps names into a set of associated properties.andP;  Propertiesconsist of a Property Name, Property Type, and Property Value.andP;  Propertyvalues have two types: the type item (which is an uninterrupted block ofdata) and the type group (which is a set of names).andP;  Many properties can beassociated with a name.andP;  For example, a user name can have propertiesdefining a descriptive content (the role of the user in the organization),the user password for authentication, the home file server name, the mailbox,printer names, and so on.andM;Clearinghouse databases are distributed and replicated, each with a copy of aportion of the global name database.andP;  Clearinghouse sets no requirements asto the portion of the global database each Clearinghouse server must store.andO;Local Clearinghouse databases can contain as many domains as the networkadministrators need to maximize response time.andM;Clearinghouse updates are automatic.andP;  When one Clearinghouse domain updatesits own domain database, it also propagates the change if the domain databaseis replicated on more than one server.andP;  Clearinghouse uses time-stampedE-mail messages to perform the update.andP;  This creates a situation where aserver could have databases that are temporaily out of synch.andM;AUTHENTICATION.andP;  The Authentication Protocol provides both a strong and asimple level of protection.andP;  Each user has two passwords, strong and simple.andO;Services have only strong passwords.andP;  Actual passwords used depend on theworkstation encryption capability and the networks securitu environment.andM;For strong authentication, a requester first uses the Authentication Protocolto contact an authentication Service server, and identifies itself and thetarget of the request by name.andP;  At the same time, the initiating partysupplies a random number called a nonce.andP;  The Authentication Service thenreturns the nonce, the name of the target recipient, a conversation key, anda set of encrypted credentials that only the recipient can decrypt.andP;  Theinitiator then checks the nonce and the name of the recipient.andP;  If those twoitems are the same as those it originally sent, the initiator is reasonablyconfident that the transaction is an original one.andP;  The set of credentials,encrypted with the recipient's name, contain the conversation key, theinitiator's name, and the specification of the time span for which thecredentials will be valid.andP;  The initiator then uses the credentials to createan encrypted time verifier, which it then sends to the recipient along withthe original encrypted credentials supplied by the Authentication Service.andO;The recipient then decrypts the time value to determine whether or not thetransaction is an old one, and that the initiator's credentials are trusted.andO;The recipient then returns a verifier to the initiator to ensure that therecipient is not an impostor.andM;The simple level of security, by contrast, requires no interaction by theinitiator with an Authentication Service.andP;  The initiator sends its name and asimple key to the recipient.andP;  The recipient checks the key with theAuthentication Service.andM;TIME.andP;  The Time Protocol defines time as a Courier data type.andP;  It alsospecifies the manner in which a Time Service makes the current time availablefor clients or other network elements.andP;  In a distributed network environment,a consistent time stamp throughout the network becomes invaluable.andM;Basic Application Services.andP;  The Basic Application Services include thefollowing protocols:andM;* Gateway access * Printing * Filing * Mail TransportandM;GATEWAY ACCESS.andP;  The Gateway Access Protocol (GAP) is designed for XNS tonon-XNS system communication.andP;  GAP specifies a variety of ways for thetransfer of data and the frequency of activity.andP;  Like many XNS enablers, itis open to working with a variety of platforms.andP;  However, it does nottranslate information between systems.andP;  Such a service must come from athird-party or from a workstation application.andM;GAP uses Courier and SPP to issue or to receive customized command and datasequences, exactly replicating the command and data sequences used by thetarget system.andP;  Xerox provides a variety of gateway services built on top ofthe GAP.andP;  Among them are:andM;* External Communication Service to support access via terminal emulation(3270, VT-100, and TTY) for XNS workstations to non-XNS hostsandM;* Interactive Terminal Service for dial-up communication to an XNS internetfor remote workstations and terminalsandM;* Remote Batch Service to accomodate 2770, 2780 and 3780 BSC protocolsandM;* 850/860 Gateway Service for connecting Xerox 850 and 860 text processorsandM;FILING.andP;  The Filing Protocol determines the interactions between clients andfile services in XNS.andP;  The file service delivers files to the user; it takesno responsibility for the contents of the file or the ability of the clientto interpret the file.andM;The Filing Protocol consists of four layers: Session on the bottom, followedby File, Directory, and Search on the top (see Illustration 4).andM;The Session sublayer lays the foundation for a set of related action requestsfrom the client to the server, beginning with authentication.andP;  The Filesublayer is responsible for the file data structure and for implementing fileoperations.andP;  Attributes provide additional information about the file.andP;  Someattributes are client (applications) specific; others are interpreted for theuse of the file service itself.andM;The Directory sublayer provides a hierarchical structure for organizingfiles.andP;  The Search layer provides a mechanism for identifying a set of filesthrough similarities in their names -- a directory search, in other words.andM;The XNS File Service organizes files into drawers, folders and documents.andP;  Itassociates attributes such as time of creation) as well as a name to theobjects in the storage hierarchy.andP;  The File Service supports drawer-levelaccess controls.andM;MAILING.andP;  The XNS mail transport protocol corresponds to the boundary betweenthe Message Transport layer and the User Agent layer in the X.400 messagingscheme.andP;  Rather than delivering the mail directly to a workstation, however,XNS uses the Inbasket Protocol to keep in-baskets on servers.andP;  This allowssome additional flexibility in retrieving mail from a variety ofworkstations.andP;  Architecturally, the inbasket Protocol corresponds to theinternal interface of the User Agent layer for X.400.andP;  Put another way: theMail Transport Protocol handles mailing, while the Inbasket Protocol handlesreceiving.andM;For content, the Xerox Mail format is aligned with the CCITT X.420 P2specification, although the mailing system supports a variety of contentformats.andM;PRINTING.andP;  The Print Protocol and Service govern the transmission of adocument converted to Interpress to an output device on the network.andP;  ThePrint Service interprets the Interpress master and directs the output devicethrough the stages of spooling, formatting and printing.andM;OTHER SERVICES.andP;  We've touched on only a few of the base XNS services as ameans of highlighting the distributed network environment underlyingStructured ViewPoint.andP;  For an example of the interrelation of some XNScomponents, consider the diagram in Illustration 5, which describes a sampleClearinghouse request.andM;Xerox also offers an ever-increasing set of services designed to connect XNSto the rest of the world.andP;  Among them:andM;* TCP-XNS Gateway Services * X.400 External Mail gateway * SNA Mail Relay *XNS for the VMS Operating SystemandM;We will defer discussion of those for another time, as our concern here ismore with SVP as implemented within the XNS environment.andM;Structured ViewPointandM;The ViewPoint software suite provides a graphical, object-orientedenvironment for user applications.andP;  Structured ViewPoint (SVP) extends thatuser model to provide structured mechanisms for organizing and enhancingteamwork (one of Xerox's current strategic goals) through the structuredmanagement of documents and project-related information.andP;  In a way, SVP isthe workgroup analog to the single-user Personal Information Managers (PIMs)that are emerging on the desktop.andM;The keyword here is structured.andP;  We believe that structure will become anincreasingly important attribute in the emerging distributed computingenvironments.andP;  Structure is, after all, one of the best ways to tacklecomplexity.andP;  Through its use of an Oracle database, SVP delivers not only adocument library service, but also mechanisms for creating, organizing, andthen finding and retrieving document and project metadata.andM;Structured ViewPoint can then have two meanings.andP;  The literal is adescription of these extensions to the ViewPoint environment, i.e., aViewPoint that is structured.andP;  More figuratively, however, the softwareendows the user with a structured view of the information strewn across theentire network.andM;Structured ViewPoint adds four application capabilities to the environment:andM;* Document and information management * Graphical modeling and CASEmethodologies * Project management * Iconic access to Oracle on VMSandM;SVP is not a different ViewPoint; it is a set of applications and servicesthat apply to any applications requiring information access and monitoring ina team environment (see Illustration 6).andM;Such application requirements mandate the use of a database.andP;  Xerox opted touse Oracle running on VMS.andP;  The beauty of the SVP environment is that itrequires no intervention on the part of the user, or on the part of theOracle DBA (database administrator) or MIS shop.andP;  More on this below.andO;Suffice it to say for now, though, that SVP actually creates tables andrecords within Oracle and manages the information without a user eversuspecting that he or she is connected to a database manager, or to adifferent machine in a different operating environment.andP;  This is the beautyof well-implemented distributed network computing.andM;The project management and the graphical modeling and CASE methodologyapplications all use a set of drawing capabilities based upon the Xerox ProIllustrator application.andP;  A Pro Illustrator user would thus face a familiarinterface for exploiting some of the advanced function detailed below.andM;Document and Information Management.andP;  Document and information management isan application area where we will see rapid growth and development during thenext few years.andP;  It's hard enough finding your own documents that you wrote afew weeks ago.andP;  Increase those documents by several orders of magnitude,factor in the need for users to retrieve a document someone else wrote, andyou have an information crisis on your hands.andM;There are a variety of approaches to the problem of document management:andM;* The unstructured personal or group file cabinet for the casual file-sharingof hundreds of documentsandM;* The structured library, which offers controlled access and version controlthrough a more formal hierarchical structure and is suited for handlingthousands of documentsandM;* The research repository, for supporting structured and unstructuredretrieval from millions of documentsandM;For most workgroups, the first two solutions will work extremely well.andO;ViewPoint provides a solution for the first solution.andP;  Structured ViewPointadds support for Shared Libraries (see Illustration 7).andM;SVP Shared Libraries use the conceptual model of Shared Books to present theinformation to users.andP;  The Shared Books capability provided by SVP is verydifferent than the Shared Books delivered with ViewPoint 2.0.andP;  The latter wasmore a shared network disk volume than anything else.andP;  The new Shared Booksis much simpler to use.andP;  No librarian server is involved, although librariansstill perform traditional library tasks, such as determining how and wheretypes of information can be stored.andP;  Users are now able to be much moreactive in changing the information stored in Shared Books.andP;  Shared Books nowprovides mutual exclusion (file-locking) to protect the integrity of thefile.andP;  File-locking has three basic functions: the lock, the check-infollowing modification, and the unlock to release the file for editing byother users.andP;  Reliability appears to be much higher in this implementation.andM;The new Shared Books also features what Xerox calls multidimensionalintegration.andP;  All aspects of the ViewPoint environment are available fromwithin Shared Books, and all ViewPoint applications have access to the SharedBooks Services.andP;  The ViewPoint icons of VP Documents, Folders, Canvases, andso on used to reside only at the file-drawer level.andP;  (See Illustration 8.)andM;There are six basic objects within the Shared Library:andM;* The File Drawer, a common metaphor to ViewPoint users, contains RemoteShares Books in the Shared Library.andM;* A Shared Book with Database.andP;  This object allows users to modify sharedfiles at his or her workstation.andM;* Reference Book.andP;  The Reference Book is a Shared Book with Database thatcontains references to all the rest of the books in the library.andM;* Remote Shared Book.andP;  A user's filling out a book property sheetautomatically creates the Remote Shared Book on a file server.andP;  This iconrepresents the book that actually holds the physical data shared by users.andO;In Xerox parlance, this is &quot;the Truth.&quot;andP;  And the Truth resides on the server-- a requirement for teamwork.andM;* Reference to Shared Books.andP;  A Reference is a pointer to a Remote SharedBook.andP;  Xerox recommends sending this icon through the mail when necessary, asit is a pointer to a set of files, not the actual files themselves.andM;* Card Catalog (or Quick Queries).andP;  The Card Catalog window provides aform-based front end to the database behind each shared book.andP;  Users mayiconically query to the Oracle database across multiple shared books,searching for combinations of filing, graphics, data attachments, andViewPoint fields in the window.andM;Each of the book icons has a subtly different look, indicating the functionalrole with the Shared Library.andP;  The Remote Shared Book has a solid blackborder and solid people, indicating that it holds actual file content.andP;  Thereference book has a gray border and gray people to indicate that it is areference icon.andP;  The Shared Book with Database icon combines the two.andP;  Theoutside border of the icon is gray, indicating its role as a referencepointer.andP;  An inside border is solid, as are the people drawn inside, toindicate that it can deal with real files on the user's desktop as well.andM;SETTING UP THE LIBRARY.andP;  The library requires some forethought.andP;  Users needto have a system administrator creat a file drawer (or library) for them.andO;Users also must provide the VAX and Oracle account names and passwords, andthe Oracle account must have a &quot;resource&quot; privilege.andM;Once the library drawer exists, the user is free to begin creating the actualbooks.andP;  Xerox recommends some preplanning of the books and the names requiredfor the projects in question.andP;  Establishing the structure prior to beginningwork on the project delivers, in Xerox's experience, &quot;direct and cumulativeschedule gains.&quot;andM;The actual creation of the book requires the user only to fill out of aproperty sheet on a blank book icon with the following items:andM;* The title of the book.andM;* Whether or not the book's contents are sorted.andM;* Any subject or notes that might be helpfulandM;* Authors of the book.andM;* The remote location in the Server:Domain:Organization syntax of XNS.andM;* The number of versions that the book will keep (from 1 to all).andM;* The network name of the database used.andP;  Users need to find out this namefrom the system administrator.andM;* The VAX logon name.andM;* The VAX password.andM;* The Oracle logon.andM;* The Oracle password.andM;* The number of retrieved rows desired during a Quick Query.andM;* The number of characters of LONG datatypes filed required in a Quick Query.andM;* Whether or not to send ViewPoint fields to the database.andP;  If chosen, thisoption sends the fields in the document to the database, making theinformation in those fields available for Quick Queries.andM;When the selecting is done, the client and server components of the SharedBook with Database are created.andM;That's it.andP;  At no point has a database administrator gone in to create theOracle tables.andM;USING STRUCTURED VIEWPOINT.andP;  Because the Shared Library capabilities areintegrated within the ViewPoint environment, the Shared Library becomes ageneric resource for a variety of application uses.andP;  Some obvious candidates,aside from shared editing and group document creation, are:andM;* Forms/data management.andM;* Shared planning and project management.andP;  Different books can containvarious aspects of planning (Work Breakdown Structure) and project management(PERTC/CPM) graphics.andM;* Group creation of business plans.andM;* CASE methods.andM;* The maintenance of reference documents.andM;Project Management.andP;  The set of capabilities SVP offers in the area ofproject management wouldn't satisfy a professional project manager until CPMscheduling is available.andP;  However, the capabilities SVP delivers for themanagement of many group business projects (which can be quite complex) areextremely tantilizing.andM;SVP users can create PERT/CPM, Work Breakdown Structures (WBS), organizationcharts, and data reports through high-level drawing capabilities.andP;  PERT/CPMare standard project management methods that display tasks, activities, andmilestones in a time sequence.andM;The Work Breakdown Structure uses a graphic tree arrangement to map out thephases of project.andP;  The tree can consist of many levels, the lowest levelbeing the individual tasks that make up a project.andP;  The WBS, in other words,provides a graphic decomposition of the entire project.andP;  Using such a toolbefore beginning a project can be an invaluable aid.andP;  The WBS function can beapplied to just about anything, from document flow through a publishing firmto the reporting structure of an organization.andM;To create a frame within a ViewPoint document for any of the graphicalapplications of SVP, the user selects a &quot;special keyboard&quot; by striking aparticular key to pull up tools for one of 6 specific frames:andM;* Xerox Pro Illustrator * Organization Charts * PERT/CPM Charts * StructureCharts * Data Flow Diagrams * Entity Relationship DiagramsandM;Though the interface and basic toolset is the same for each, each specialkeyboard offers a set of objects and graphic tools specific to the particularapplication.andP;  For example, the PERT chart offers Event, Activity, DummyActivity, and Connector name objects.andP;  The Entity Relationship specialkeyboard offers Entity, Primary Attribute, Secondary Attribute objects, etc.andM;The user does not have to change his or her means of interacting with thesystem.andP;  It is all object oriented, with the full direct manipulationcapabilities.andM;Backing each of the various graphics objects is a table comprisinguser-specified components of information.andP;  When a user checks a drawing orchart into the library, SVP automatically creates the Oracle database table.andO;Users can then call up a Data Attachment table that mirrors the structure ofthe database table in Oracle.andP;  The tabular and the graphic objects thus aredifferent instantiations or views of the same Oracle data.andP;  Any changes tothe diagram are reflected in the table.andP;  Similarly, any changes in the tableare reflected in the diagram.andP;  This linkage creates some powerfulcapabilities.andM;SVP offers an extremely useful &quot;You Are Here&quot; feature that exploits thisarchitecture.andP;  If the user opens the attachment table, selects an object or aconnector in the graphic diagram, and then clicks on the &quot;You Are Here&quot;button in the Attachment window header, SVP automatically scrolls the tableso that the corresponding object is in the center of the table, and thenhighlights the object.andP;  The process also works in reverse.andP;  Highlighting theelement in the Attachment table and then selecting &quot;You Are Here&quot; forces thecorresponding graphic object to blink three times.andP;  This type of navigationalability is extremely useful (and should be in more than this type ofapplication as well).andP;  And, as noted below, SVP can iconically generate SQLqueries across the various project books to access the composite informationacross all files.andM;SVP's project management capabilities alone should make it a highlyattractive solution to a certain set of buyers.andM;Graphical Modeling and CASE Methodology.andP;  SVP also can apply its drawingcapabilities to support some of the popular graphical modeling methodologiesfor Computer Aided Software Engineering (CASE): Data Flow Diagrams, StructureCharts, and Entity Relationship Diagrams.andM;Data Flow Diagrams show the data flow between processes and correspondingexternal interfaces.andP;  With SVP, process, flow, and store objects may behierarchically decomposed.andM;The Structure Charts portray a network hierarchy of modules, where thehierarchy represents calling sequences and passes data between modules.andM;Entity Relationship diagrams depict a network of generalized objects that areconnected by relations with optional attached attributes.andM;Although the &quot;special&quot; keyboards for these tasks are different than those forthe project management modules, all of these SVP applications offercomparable support for decomposing complex tasks into a manipulable structurewith corresponding transparent creation of Oracle data tables to manage theinformation among groups of users.andM;Iconic Access to Oracle.andP;  SVP offers an iconic interface for quick queriesacross the Oracle databases that are used to back the various SVPapplications.andM;SVP has a Quick Query function that generates SQL queries based on the userselection of icons across multiple books and multiple types of information.andM;Quick Queries offers four different types of searches at this time: FilingAttributes, SVP Graphic Object types, SVP Graphic Data Attachments, andViewPoint document fields and tables.andP;  Because of the inclusion of projectmanagement within SVP, users can query, for example, on Responsibility andLocation within a PERT Chart activity.andM;This is where a great deal of the power of SVP becomes apparent.andP;  Considerthe ability of a manager or of a team member to retrieve quickly which personhas what responsibilities for a particular project.andM;Let's take a case in point.andP;  Wehn we visited Xerox to examine SVP, we workedon the network -- the real live Xerox network.andP;  Our hosts pulled up theproject plan for the roll-out of Structured ViewPoint and noted theirindividual responsibilities (&quot;I've had to do that much?&quot;).andP;  We located adocument via the data attachment table for the project and tried to pull itout.andP;  Another user had checked the document out, but we, in turn, could seewho was working on it, etc.andP;  Now, factor into this capability that we weresitting in Rochester, New York, the document being edited was in Webster, NewYork, and the eager beaver author was in El Segundo, California.andP;  It was allcompletely transparent.andP;  Very nice.andP;  Very elegant.andM;Use of Network Services.andP;  Xerox built on top of its existing network servicesto provide the critical Oracle support for Structured ViewPoint.andO;Essentially, Xerox wrote a client database stub for each workstation (seeIllustration 10).andP;  The client database stub then works across XNS to thecorresponding database server stub on the VAX (which is also running XNS forVMS).andM;COMMENTSandM;Xerox is doing very many things right.andP;  Unlike other major vendors that areclearly in decline.andP;  Xerox is coming back with a vengeance.andP;  For one thing,the current shift to distributed network computing and object-orientation inthe general market is just what Xerox has been preparing for and advocatingfor two decades.andM;Xerox's own success in the market depends upon the speed with which thecompany can make the switch to standards and upon the continued vigor of itsISO marketing effort.andM;Although it might not have articulated its open systems strategy formally,Xerox's new product thrust is based, in large part, on the premise that amulti-vendor network environment exists.andP;  Xerox is doing its best to exploitthat fact.andP;  We've covered only one network application product in thisreport.andP;  Xerox has other new, important products based on the clien/servernetwork architecture as well.andP;  Document Search and Retrieval (DSR), forexample, uses a VAX running Batelle's BASIS as a backend for a ViewPointfront-end.andP;  A real-time national language translation package uses XNS' SNAGateway to connect to Systran running on an IBM MVS system.andP;  Users can definea block of text in a ViewPoint document, specify the target language, and geta translation back with 98 percent fidelity.andM;Xerox does have an open systems strategy for both clients and servers.andP;  Onthe client side, expect to see an implementation of ViewPoint on the PC.andO;ViewPoint does require astoundingly little memory, given its function, butwe're not sure even Xerox researchers could stuff it all into DOS.andP;  Expect ahardware/software add-in solution.andP;  The other client due for ViewPoint is theSun workstation.andP;  Those two ports whould free Xerox from the burden of havingto sell the 6085 workstations as the engine for its software solution.andP;  Weshould note, however, that the 6085 Model 2 is a zippy little box.andM;On the server side, Xerox is busy porting XNS over to Sun.andP;  The medium-rangeopen system solution then becomes Sun servers running XNS for Sun, PC and6085 clents.andP;  This solution does beg the question of the ultimate directionof XNS.andM;Xerox is in a tricky position.andP;  It would be extremely difficult for it towalk away from XNS.andP;  Yet it also doesn't want to present XNS as another setof protocols that it is trying to force on users.andP;  The preferred positioningcurrently within Xerox is that XNS is an immediate solution for groupproductivity, and an architectural foundation for upcoming open standards.andO;Users that have an immediate need for advanced collaborative support systemscan buy into XNS now, and then converge with where the industry should endup.andM;The essential problem here is that the &quot;convergence&quot; pathway and timetableare not particularly clear.andP;  (Not even to Xerox, we suspect.)andP;  In some ways,listening to some of the Xerox conversations reminds us of similarconversations people at Apollo used to have.andP;  Apollo, without question, haddeveloped a particularly effective, albeit non-standard, distributednetworking solution.andP;  The Network Computing System is beginning to have animportant impact on the course of the industry.andP;  Major chunks of NCS are nowoffered up to the OSF for its DCE, and are being offered by leading vendorssuch as IBM.andP;  Yet the excellence of design didn't do much for Apollo as abusinesS.andP;  HP's acquiring Apollo was an excellent outcome for both.andM;For Xerox to make its &quot;functionality now, with a foundation for convergence&quot;positioning work, it must make its intentions and its mechanisms for headingto open standards clear.andM;These issues aside, the market will feel Xerox's impact in two main ways.andO;First, of course, there are the competitive situations that Xerox will winbecause of its solutions.andP;  But the greater effect will come from theinfluence Xerox's solutions should have an other vendors.andP;  We suspect thatSVP-type functionality will begin appearing from a variety of sources.andP;  Asthe Xerox Alto inspired some fundamental decisions about workstationcomputing, user interfaces, and object orientation, so should solutions suchas SVP catalyze a qualitative change in the thinking about workgroupsolutions.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
