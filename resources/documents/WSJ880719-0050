The voluminous report, previously hailed by Mr. Meese as a &quot;vindication&quot; of his activities, doesn't seem to fit that description. Studded with embarrassing details about the attorney general's missteps and &quot;probable&quot; illegal acts, it concludes, in effect, that Mr. Meese wasn't prosecuted only because investigators couldn't prove that his intentions were corrupt or that he &quot;acted out of self-interest.&quot;    In a news conference, Mr. McKay told reporters that he decided it would be wrong to make an example of Mr. Meese simply because of his high government position and the intense publicity surrounding the case. &quot;If he was an ordinary citizen, he wouldn't be prosecuted,&quot; Mr. McKay said.    Nevertheless, the report is bound to keep the controversy boiling throughout this year's presidential campaign, and the strong language could influence an internal Justice Department review of Mr. Meese's ethics that already is under way.    The document is sharply critical of Mr. Meese for, among other things, apparent insensitivity to potential ethical problems; knowingly filing a federal tax return that left out capital gains from certain stock transactions; and taking &quot;extraordinary&quot; steps to assist an ill-fated, Mideast oil-pipeline proposal advocated by Mr. Wallach.    Nathan Lewin, Mr. Meese's main attorney during the 14-month grand jury investigation, held his own news conference to lambaste what he called the prosecutor's &quot;very cheap shot.&quot; A detailed, three-inch thick response prepared by Mr. Lewin -- including legal analysis from outside lawyers -- dismissed portions of Mr. McKay's report dealing with the $1 billion pipeline proposal. He called that part of the prosecutor's inquiry a &quot;mammothly expensive feckless venture&quot; that found absolutely no evidence &quot;of the slightest illegality or impropriety.&quot;    The report marks the first time such a court-appointed prosecutor has publicly spelled out arguments for and against seeking criminal charges. Prosecutors routinely decide whether to seek charges based on criminal intent and the probability of persuading a jury of corrupt motives, but rarely discuss their reasoning with outsiders.    &quot;It's unusual for it to be publicly pronounced,&quot; especially in such a high-profile case, according to Robert Morvillo, a former chief of the criminal division of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan. He also noted that, when investigations of high government officials turn up strong evidence of wrongdoing, &quot;the pressure of public scrutiny usually makes prosecutors bend toward prosecution.&quot;    Mr. Meese, who submitted his resignation when the report was filed under seal with a special federal court nearly two weeks ago, tried to turn the tables on the prosecutor during a feisty news conference yesterday. The attorney general said he was &quot;outraged&quot; and &quot;appalled&quot; by Mr. McKay's conclusions, claiming that the prosecutor &quot;violated every principle of decency.&quot;    By asserting that there were grounds for criminal prosecution, Mr. McKay's report leaves &quot;a false implication of wrongdoing that is at odds with our system of justice,&quot; Mr. Meese said. If any Justice Department lawyer publicly made such allegations without seeking an indictment, Mr. Meese asserted, &quot;they'd be fired.&quot;    The attorney general had called the report a vindication, even before he had read it, because the prosecutor didn't seek any criminal charges. Mr. Meese and his attorneys contend that Mr. McKay's conclusions and criticisms about ethical lapses are outside his scope of authority.    The report was tougher on two of Mr. Meese's close associates, explicitly calling for further criminal investigation of Mr. Wallach and Franklyn Chinn, Mr. Meese's former personal financial adviser, for suspected felony tax violations.    The report makes the following assertions about Mr. Meese:   --The evidence probably would show &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Mr. Meese &quot;willfully permitted a materially false tax return to be filed&quot; on his behalf for 1985, which failed to declare about $20,000 in capital gains from the sale of regional Bell telephone securities. If the case were prosecuted, according to Mr. McKay, the evidence would show that Mr. Meese at the time knowingly failed to pay any taxes on those profits. The attorney general didn't take steps to contact the Internal Revenue Service about filing an amended return until May 1987, when the independent prosecutor asked to review his tax returns.    However, considering Mr. Meese's &quot;habit of procrastination&quot; in such personal financial matters and the fact that Mr. Meese apparently &quot;never intended to permanently deprive the government&quot; of the taxes due, the report concludes that prosecution isn't warranted.    --In 1985 and 1986, while Mr. Meese still held an interest in the regional Bell companies, he participated in &quot;a personal and substantial&quot; way in policy decisions, preparing a court filing and formulating proposed legislation affecting the telecommunications industry. &quot;There was a very real possibility that the market value&quot; of his holdings &quot;would have been affected by the resolution of those matters,&quot; according to Mr. McKay.    But in the final analysis, according to the report, Mr. Meese's involvement didn't appreciably affect those decisions and the attorney general took some steps -- although they turned out to be &quot;ineffective&quot; -- to divest himself earlier of his financial interest in the regional telephone companies.    --At Mr. Wallach's urging, Mr. Meese &quot;undertook unusual official activities&quot; to encourage U.S. government support for the proposed Mideast pipeline and to keep the project alive. These included an &quot;extraordinary request&quot; to arrange a meeting between Mr. Wallach and then-White House national security adviser Robert McFarlane.    The report said that &quot;within hours&quot; of becoming involved with the pipeline project, Mr. Wallach sought Mr. Meese's assistance. According to Mr. McKay, the attorney general later authorized &quot;in essence, the private use by Mr. Wallach&quot; of the Justice Department's office of legal counsel in an effort to salvage the project.    But despite &quot;the impression&quot; in one much-publicized memo from Mr. Wallach to Mr. Meese that &quot;a bribe was at least authorized&quot; to be paid to Israel's Labor Party, the report didn't find any &quot;credible&quot; evidence that Mr. Meese violated the federal law prohibiting bribes or payoffs overseas.    --The document, illustrating the two men's extensive ties, disclosed that Mr. Wallach helped the attorney general obtain two personal loans, at market rates, totaling $340,000.    --In 1983, Mr. Meese asked Malcolm Baldrige, then secretary of commerce, to try to help Wedtech Corp., the now-defunct military contractor that paid Mr. Wallach more than $1 million in fees and stock options.    While none of the Meese-Wallach ties violated federal laws barring gratuities, the report found &quot;some evidence to support a conclusion&quot; that Mr. Meese should have been &quot;sensitive to the possibility&quot; that his official acts may have improperly benefited his old friend.    ---   Jill Abramson contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
