Police said the grenades were flung at the Kathiresan temple inthe heart of Colombo on the main Galle Road. More than 60 peoplewere inside the temple at the time of the explosions, templeofficials said.   The temple's clock, which was shattered in the blasts, showedthe time of the attack as 7:51 p.m. Coconuts, bananas and beetleleaves brought by devotees as sacred offerings were scatteredthroughout the temple's blood-splattered inner chambers.   The victims of the blast were believed to be Tamils. Police,army officials and a temple priest refused to speculate on whomight be responsible for the attack.   The explosions at the temple occurred just hours after a majorpolitician and popular film star, Vijaya Kumaranatunga, was gunneddown by suspected Sinhalese extremists at his home. Another personinjured in the gunfire later died in the hospital.   Police said they did not know if the two attacks were related.   Sri Lanka has been torn by Tamil separatist violence in thenorth and east. The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu and form 18percent of the country's 16 million people, say they arediscriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese majority.   S. Pathmanabha, a priest at the Kathiresan temple, told TheAssociated Press he was about to begin the main ceremony of theShivaratri religious festival when the blasts occurred.   More than 100 army troops and policemen cordoned off the areaand launched a massive search for the assailants. The police alsosearched for other hidden explosives in the vicinity.   An officer from the army's bomb disposal squad said the grenadeswere M-14s believed to be manufactured in Singapore.   Police blamed Kumaranatunga's death, meanwhile, on the outlawedPeople's Liberation Front, an extremist Sinhalese organization thatopposes the India-Sri Lanka peace accord signed July 29 to end theTamil ethnic war.   Kumaranatunga, 43, had supported the accord, which grants someautonomy to Tamil-dominated areas in exchange for a surrender ofarms. The largest Tamil rebel group has rejected the accord.   More than 45,000 Indian troops are in Sri Lanka to disarm theTamil rebels and enforce the peace accord. India is involvedbecause of the sympathies of its own 60 million Tamils and its roleas a regional power.   Kumaranatunga, a leader of the Sri Lanka Mahajana (People's)Party and son-in-law of former Prime Minister SirimavoBandaranaike, was expected to run as a presidential candidate of athree-party alliance in 1989. The alliance issued a statementMonday, condemning the killings of politicians by Sinhalesemilitants.   Kumaranatunga was gunned down when two men rode up to him on amotorcycle at about noon and opened fire with an AK-47 or a T-56submachine gun, according to Ignatius Canagaratnam, chief of thepolice crime detection bureau.   The gunmen escaped after the crime, Canagaratnam said. The othervictim of the attack was identified as Upali Sarath, an artist, hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
