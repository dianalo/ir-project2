We areproposing to amend the Animal Welfare regulations, 9 CFR Part 2. As partof our revision, we are proposing to add some new sections and revise others.New sections would provide regulations on Institutional Animal Care andUse Committees, Attending Veterinarians, and Veterinary Care. These amendmentsare necessary to comply with the amendments to the Animal Welfare Act (7U.S.C. 2131, <T3>et seq.</T3>) (``Act'') contained in Pub. L. 99-198, ``The Food SecurityAct of 1985,'' enacted December 23, 1985. We are also proposing to addnew sections on Holding Facilities and Handling to improve enforcementof the Act. We are proposing to revise other portions of the regulationsin content and/or format to aid the public in understanding and using theregulations for the humane care, treatment, handling, and transportationof regulated animals. Rewriting the regulations is intended to make themeasier to understand, thereby increasing compliance and making them moreeffective.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> We will consider written comments addressing only the interrelationshipof Parts 1 and 2 of the regulations with the proposed standards of Part3, as explained in greater detail in the supplementary information whichfollows, that are postmarked or received on or before May 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Send an original and three copies of your comments toHelene R.

These regulationspertain to licensing of dealers and exhibitors and registration of facilitiesand common carriers; recordkeeping for and identification of animals; holdingperiods and facilities; inspections; Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittees; adequate veterinary care; and other areas relating to the humanecare, handling, treatment, and transportation of animals. These changeshave been proposed under the authority of the Animal Welfare Act (the Act),as amended (7 U.S.C. 2131,<T3> et seq</T3>.). They include some specific new requirements mandatedby the 1985 amendments to the Act, contained in Pub. L. 99-198, ``The FoodSecurity Act of 1985,'' enacted December 23, 1985. The Act requires theDepartment to promulgate regulations and standards governing the humanehandling, housing, care, treatment and transportation of certain animalsby dealers, research facilities, exhibitors, carriers, and intermediatehandlers. The standards and regulations must include minimum requirementswith respect to handling, housing, feeding, sanitation, veterinary care,the use of pain relieving drugs, exercise for dogs, psychological well-beingof nonhuman primates, recordkeeping, and other matters specified in section13 of the Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 2143).We solicited comments concerning the proposal for a 60-day period endingJune 1, 1987. The comment period was twice extended and ended on August27, 1987. We did not consider comments and materials received after theclosing date of August 27, 1987. We received a total of 7,857 commentsaddressing our proposal for Parts l and 2: 1,438 were from the researchcommunity; 987 were from dealers and exhibitors; and 5,432 were from membersof the general public. We included comments received from humane societiesand groups representing the public in the areas of animal welfare and animalrights with comments received from the general public.We received 344 comments (319 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the Department should accord carefulconsideration to all of the comments received as required by the AdministrativeProcedure Act. We wish to assure the commenters, regulating persons, andmembers of the general public that the Department has carefully consideredall of the comments that were received by the end of the comment period,and that we have revised the March 31, 1987 proposal on the basis of thosecomments where we considered it to be appropriate. These changes, discussedbelow, have been incorporated in this revised rule. We received much constructiveinput and appreciate the response.Supplemental Request for Comments on the Interrelationship of Parts 1,2, and 3 of the Animal Welfare RegulationsWe received 334 comments (309 from members of the research community and25 from members of the general public) suggesting that we revise the proposedrules for Parts l and 2, ``Definition of Terms'' and ``Regulations,'' andpublish a second proposal in the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>for public comment. We also received 445 comments(400 from members of the research community and 45 from members of thegeneral public) suggesting that we revise the proposals for Parts l and2 and publish them along with our proposal for standards for the exerciseof dogs and for a physical environment to promote the psychological well-beingof nonhuman primates. These specific standards are mandated by the 1985amendments to the Act.We have decided to respond to the comments we received addressing the proposedrules, and to publish revised rules for Parts 1 and 2 in the same issueof the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in which we publish our proposal to amend Part3 of the regulations, titled ``Standards.'' The revised rules reflect ourconsideration of the nearly 8,000 comments received, our experience inadministering and enforcing the regulations, and our ongoing consultationwith the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and other interestedagencies. It is our present determination that upon their adoption as finalrules, the revised provisions of Parts 1 and 2 conform with the requirementsof the Animal Welfare Act, as amended.Accordingly, we are publishing Parts 1 and 2 at this time, revised fromour initial proposal, as explained in detail below. The revised rule forPart 2 contains specific regulations required by the 1985 amendments tothe Act. These include regulations setting forth the responsibilities ofInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs); requirements forCommittee approval of animal care and use procedures in research involvinganimals; training by research facilities; use of pain relieving drugs;and inspection of animal use areas by the Committee. We believe that publicationof the revised proposal for Part 2 concerning the administrative and institutionalresponsibilities of persons subject to the Act will assist the public inreviewing the proposed standards in Part 3 by placing the proposed standardsin context. Also, many of the terms used in Part 3 are defined in Part1, and a revised proposed rule containing definitions of those terms willaid the public in understanding the standards. The Department has decidedupon this approach in the hope that it will answer many of the issues thatwould otherwise be raised in considering the standards contained in Part3. By way of example, we received 3 comments in response to proposed Part2 (2 from dealers and 1 from a member of the general public) endorsingexercise for dogs and 13 comments (12 from dealers and 1 from a memberof the general public) opposing mandatory exercise for dogs. One memberof the general public commented in opposition to allowing dogs to be kepton tethers. The requirements for exercise of dogs are directed by the Act (7 U.S.C.2143(a)(2)(B)). They are contained in Subpart A of our proposed revisionof Part 3, published elsewhere in this issue. (See companion docket no.87-004.) We invite public comment in response to the proposed rule to amendPart 3. At the urging of many commenters, we are publishing the revised rules forParts 1 and 2 for the sole purpose of soliciting comments on tha narrowissue of the interrelationship of the definitions and regulations in Parts1 and 2 with the standards we are proposing in Part 3. The public is thereforeinvited to comment exclusively on this issue. We will not consider commentsgoing beyond this issue. Comments raising objections or suggesting changes to the March 31, 1987proposal are discussed below in this supplementary information. Due tothe length of this document and the scope of the issues addressed, subheadingsare provided in the supplementary information to guide the reader throughthe material. Section numbers are used in the subheadings wherever possibleto further assist the reader. We have provided the number of comments receivedand their source (e.g., research community, members of the general public)pertaining to each section because this information may be of interestto some readers. Except as explained in this supplementary information,the provisions of the March 31, 1987 proposal have been included in thisrevised rule for the reasons set forth in that proposal. In our discussion of the comments we received, we refer to both the proposedrule published March 31, 1987 and to this revised proposed rule. In orderto assist the reader in distinguishing between these two documents, weuse the terms ``proposed'' or ``proposal'' when referring to the March31, 1987 proposed rule. We use the terms ``revised'' or ``revision'' whenreferring to this revised rule. In the supplementary information to proposed Parts 1 and 2, we stated that,based upon the information available to the Department, the proposed ruleswere issued in conformance with Executive Order 12291 and Secretary's MemorandumNo. 1512-1, and that they had been determined not to be ``major rules''(52 FR 10295 and 10307). We also stated that the information collectionprovisions included in proposed Part 2 had been submitted for approvalto the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) (52 FR 10307) and that proposedPart 1 contained no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501, <T3>et seq.</T3>). We further stated that the proposed rules would nothave a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,as defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (52 FR 10295 and 10307-10308).We received 851 comments (825 from the research community, 25 from membersof the general public, and 1 from a dealer) stating that the Departmentshould perform the regulatory analyses required for: (1) A ``major rule''under Executive Order 12291; (2) determining the impact on small entitiesin accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act; and (3) the PaperworkReduction Act. Commenters demanded that we consider in our analysis theburden of administrative requirements required of the attending veterinarianand the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee under the proposal.We received 861 comments (834 from the research community, 1 from an exhibitor,and 26 from members of the general public) stating their disagreement withour statement that the proposed regulations are not a ``major rule'' underExecutive Order 12291 and that the regulations would not impose significantfinancial burdens on registrants and licensees. In conducting the regulatory analyses referenced above, we considered Parts1 and 2 separately. The determinations we made were preliminary ones. Now,with more information available to us, including the comments we received,we have determined to consider the combined impact of Parts 1, 2, and 3.We have determined that, considered together, the rules for Parts 1, 2,and 3 are a major rule. A discussion of the regulatory analyses performedappears under the headings, ``Executive Order 12291,'' ``Regulatory FlexibilityAct,'' and ``Paperwork Reduction Act.'' General Comments We received 939 comments (910 from members of the general public, 25 fromthe research community, 3 from exhibitors, and 1 from a dealer) expressinggeneral support for the proposed regulations. We also received 296 comments(295 from members of the general public and 1 from the research community)in support of the proposed regulations and stating that the Departmentshould not lessen them due to pressure from associations for biomedicalresearch. We received 256 comments (189 from members of the general public,44 from the research community, 16 from dealers, and 1 from an exhibitor)expressing general opposition to stronger regulations. We also receivedmany comments expressing specific objections to the proposed regulations.We received 1,060 comments (1,034 from the research community and 26 frommembers of the general public) stating that the proposed rules exceed ourstatutory authority under the Act and are not consistent with the intentof Congress. We disagree with these comments and believe that ample statutoryauthority exists for these regulations. In the supplementary informationwhich follows, we respond to those comments challenging our statutory authorityfor specific provisions of the regulations and our carrying out of congressionalintent. We received 613 comments (588 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the Department did not coordinate withthe Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) in issuing the proposedregulations, as required by the Act. Section 15 of the Act directs that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[t]he Secretary shall consult and cooperate with other Federal departments,agencies, or instrumentalities concerned with the welfare of animals usedfor research, experimentation or exhibition, or administration of statutesregulating the transportation in commerce or handling in connection therewithof any animals when establishing standards pursuant to section 13 and incarrying out the purposes of this Act. The Secretary shall consult withthe Secretary of Health and Human Services prior to issuance of regulations.(7 U.S.C. 2146(a)).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Department did consult extensively with HHS. On numerous occasionsbefore issuing the proposed regulations, we discussed the issues with HHSrepresentatives and provided HHS with copies of each draft of our proposalfor review and comment. HHS indicated its concurrence with the proposedregulations. In evaluating the comments received in response to the proposaland in preparing this revised rule, we have consulted extensively and onan ongoing basis with HHS. A representative from The National Institutesof Health was detailed to work with APHIS and to provide the HHS positionon all issues affecting the research community that were raised by thecommenters. We also convened a meeting with representatives of HHS to discussand resolve outstanding differences between HHS and the Department. Throughthis give and take we achieved what we understand to be a mutually satisfactoryresolution of many of our outstanding differences. We believe that thisrevised rule is reasonable and, based upon our ongoing communication withHHS, that it could be readily implemented in the research community.We received 106 comments (105 from the research community and 1 from amember of the general public) stating that the regulations as proposedwould be inconsistent with other federal regulations. We disagree withthe import of this characterization. We believe that any remaining differencesbetween Parts 1 and 2 of the Animal Welfare regulations, as revised, andthose related regulations of other agencies, particularly those of HHS,are necessitated by requirements contained in the Act. As stated in thepreceding paragraph, we have attempted to reconcile differences betweenHHS and the Department. Our regulations must, however, fulfill the mandateof Congress and must be authorized by the Act, as amended.We received 1,004 comments (979 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) objecting to the proposed regulations onthe grounds that they would interfere with or impede research. The Departmenthas remained especially sensitive throughout the rule-making process tothis issue. Congress stated in the 1985 amendments that ``[n]othing in[the] Act (i) except as provided in paragraph (7) of [subsection (a)] shallbe construed as authorizing the Secretary to promulgate rules, regulations,or orders with regard to the design, outlines, or guidelines of actualresearch or experimentation by a research facility as determined by suchfacility; (ii) except as provided * * * shall be construed as authorizingthe Secretary to promulgate rules, regulations, or orders with regard tothe performance of actual research or experimentation by a research facilityas determined by such research facility; * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(6)(A)(i) and (ii)). Paragraph (7) of subsection (a) provides that the Secretarywill require each research facility to show upon inspection and to reportat least annually that it is in compliance with the Act and that professionallyacceptable standards governing the care, treatment, and use of animalsare being followed during research or experimentation. It also requiresthe research facilities to provide information and assurances concerningpainful procedures, and an explanation for any deviation from the standardspromulgated under section 13(a) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)). Nevertheless,the Act imposes new responsibilities upon research facilities, as wellas others subject to the Act, which necessarily impact upon the internalworkings of research facilities. There are some costs necessarily associatedwith changes of this kind. Regulated persons who must alter their internalprocedures and structure and their lines of reporting and responsibilityto accommodate the 1985 amendments to the Act may feel that the regulationsimpose an undue burden. We believe, however, that the burdens imposed onresearch facilities are statutorily required and are reasonable in orderto effectuate the purposes of the Act and the 1985 amendments to the Act,and that they are the minimum necessary to accomplish those goals.We received 315 comments (290 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that APHIS has failed to show a rationalconnection between the proposed rules and the agency record. We have beencharged with the responsibility of administering and enforcing the AnimalWelfare Act since it was enacted in 1966. Our experience has revealed areasin which more stringent regulations are necessary. The supplementary informationcontained in the March 31, 1987 proposed rule and in this revised rulehighlight areas where additional regulatory efforts have proven necessary.These revised regulations provide mechanisms designed to prevent circumventionof the Act and the regulations and to assist the Department in its enforcementefforts. They are based either on the 1985 amendments to the Act or onthe Department's experience in enforcing the regulations. We believe theserevisions would better effectuate the intent of Congress to promote animalwelfare. We received 622 comments (597 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) stating that the proposed regulations improperlyenlist Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and attending veterinariansas enforcement agents of the federal government, and 1 comment from a memberof the research community in support of their use as Department agents.The duties of the Committee and the attending veterinarian at researchfacilities are more fully described in this supplementary information underthe discussion of Subparts C and D, ``Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee and Other Requirements for Research Facilities'' and ``AttendingVeterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care.'' We note that responsibilityfor compliance with the Act and the regulations and for providing necessaryassurances has always rested with the institutions and with the legallyresponsible institutional officials. Many of their duties can most effectivelybe carried out through the Committee and the attending veterinarian actingas agents of the facility and its officials, since the Committee and attendingveterinarian are usually in the best position to determine whether theresearch facility is in compliance. For this reason, the Act imposes manyoversight and supervisory responsibilities on them. We believe that thereassignment of responsibilities to the research facility from the Committeeand attending veterinarian in Subparts C and D of this revised rule clarifiesour intent that institutions act through them while remaining ultimatelyresponsible.We received comments from 105 members of the general public opposing theuse of animals for research altogether. We have made no changes based onthese comments. It would be beyond our authority to ban the use of animalsin research. Our regulations are authorized by the Act, and the Act specificallystates that ``the use of animals is instrumental in certain research andeducation for advancing knowledge of cures and treatment for diseases andinjuries which afflict both humans and animals; * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2131(b)).Seventy-four commenters (72 from the research community and 2 dealers)stated that the proposed regulations are poorly organized and written,and that clarification is needed. We believe that this supplementary informationand the revised proposed rule that follows provides the necessary reorganizationand clarification.Two commenters from the research community stated that APHIS will be unableto enforce the regulations. We disagree with the commenters based uponthe Department's enforcement record. Congress has entrusted the Departmentwith enforcement of the Animal Welfare Act and with the promulgation andenforcement of regulations under the Act since the Act's enactment in 1966.We will continue our best efforts to meet this responsibility and to performin accordance with the mandate of Congress.Subpart A_LicensingWe received 295 comments (270 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) generally endorsing the proposal regarding SubpartA.Section 2.1 Requirements and applicationProposed andSection; 2.1 sets forth who must obtain a license under the AnimalWelfare regulations and provides the application procedure for obtaininga license. It details the information which an applicant must provide andwhere an applicant must file to become licensed. This section also providesthe application fee and renewal application fee. (Annual license fees areprovided in proposed andSection; 2.6.) Exemptions from the requirement tobe licensed are included in this section along with a provision for obtaininga voluntary license in very limited circumstances. Renewal procedures areprovided and grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation of a licenseare included in this section as well. Grounds for denial of an initiallicense application are addressed in detail in proposed andSection; 2.11.Before addressing the comments received concerning proposed andSection; 2.1,we note the following clarifications we are making in this revised rule.First, proposed andSection; 2.1(a)(1) would require that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Any person, 18 years of age or older, operating or desiring to operateas a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of an auction sale except persons whoare exempted from the licensing requirements under paragraph 3 of thissubsection, must have a license.</ITAG>We are concerned that this provision could be misconstrued as allowinga person under 18 years of age to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operatorof an auction sale without having to obtain a license. We believe thatmost readers understand that persons must be at least 18 years of age tobe eligible to obtain a license to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operatorof an auction sale, and that a license is required to operate in thosecapacities. The intent underlying the minimum age requirement was statedin the supplementary information to the proposed rule. We have revisedthe final rule to reflect our intent more accurately. Second, under andSection; 2.5, as revised in this rule, licenses are validand effective unless they are terminated, suspended, or revoked, or expireat the end of the 1-year term. The proposed rule provided that licenseswould be valid and effective for l year, and did not distinguish betweeninitial license applications and applications for additional 1-year terms.We have made conforming changes throughout Subpart A to differentiate betweennew license applications and license renewals. Accordingly, proposed andSection;2.1(a)(2) is revised to require an applicant for renewal of a license toindicate all premises, facilities, or sites where animals are kept or thelicensee operates on the application for renewal. We are also replacing``termination date'' with ``expiration date,'' wherever it is used to meanthe calendar end of the 1-year license term, as in andSection; 2.1(e). Section 2.1 of the current regulations provides that persons who are exemptfrom the licensing requirement under section 3 of the Act do not have toapply for a license to operate as a dealer, exhibitor, or operator of anauction sale where dogs or cats are sold affecting commerce. We proposedto revise andSection; 2.1 by identifying those persons exempt from the licensingrequirements under section 2 or section 3 of the Act. We received 35 comments pertaining to andSection; 2.1, as proposed. Fourcommenters from the general public stated that proposed andSection; 2.1 wouldallow too many exemptions from the requirement to obtain a license. Section2 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2132(f)) defines the term ``dealer'' as:<ITAG tagnum="21">any person who, in commerce, for compensation or profit, deliversfor transportation, or transports, except as a carrier, buys, or sells,or negotiates the purchase or sale of, (1) any dog or other animal whetheralive or dead for research, teaching, exhibition, or use as a pet, or (2)any dog for hunting, security, or breeding purposes, except that this termdoes not include_(i) a retail pet store except such store which sells anyanimals to a research facility, an exhibitor, or a dealer; or (ii) anyperson who does not sell, or negotiate the purchase or sale of any wildanimal, dog, or cat and who derives no more than $500 gross income fromthe sale of other animals during any calendar year;</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The regulatory exemptions proposed are either statutorily mandatedor are in accordance with the intent of the Act, which is to regulate thecommercial use of animals, other than their use as food or fiber. Twelve dealers stated that the proposed exemptions from the licensing requirementfor retail pet stores and for persons who maintain three or fewer breedingfemale dogs or cats and who sell the offspring born and raised on theirpremises for pets or exhibition would be improper. The Act requires thatdealers and exhibitors must be licensed, and specifically provides that``any retail pet store or other person who derives less than a substantialportion of his income (as determined by the Secretary) from the breedingand raising of dogs or cats on his own premises and sells any such dogor cat to a dealer or research facility shall not be required to obtaina license as a dealer or exhibitor under this Act.'' (7 U.S.C. 2133). Asdefined in the Act, the term ``dealer'' does not include retail pet stores,except those which sell any animals to a research facility, exhibitor,or a dealer (7 U.S.C. 2132(f)). Accordingly, the proposed exemptions arestatutorily required and will continue to be included in the regulations.We are making a change in proposed andSection; 2.1(a)(3)(i) to delete minkfrom the listing of pet-type animals which retail pet stores can sell andstill be exempt from the licensing requirement. This change is in accordancewith the revised definition of ``retail pet store'' in the revised rulefor Part 1_ ``Definition of Terms,'' published elsewhere in this issue.(<T3>See </T3>companion docket no. 88-013.) We are also correcting proposed andSection; 2.1(a)(3)(iii) to read ``Anyperson who maintains a total of three (3) or fewer breeding female dogsand/or cats * * *.'' This section is intended to exempt the hobby breederswho derive less than a substantial portion of their income from the breedingand sale of dogs or cats, in accordance with section 3 of the Act (7 U.S.C.2133). The correction would clarify that a person having a combined totalof three or fewer breeding female dogs, or three or fewer breeding femalecats, or three or fewer breeding female dogs and cats qualifies for exemptionfrom the licensing requirement, not a person having three or fewer breedingfemale dogs and three or fewer breeding female cats. We are similarly correcting proposed andSection; 2.1(a)(3)(iv) to read ``Anyperson who sells fewer than 25 dogs and/or cats per year * * *.'' Thissection is intended to exempt persons who derive less than a substantialportion of their income from the breeding and raising of dogs and cats,and we have determined that the sale of a combined total of fewer than25 of these animals would qualify a person for this exemption. The correctionclarifies that a person selling fewer than 25 dogs, or 25 cats, or 25 dogsand cats qualifies for exemption from the licensing requirement, not aperson selling fewer than 25 dogs and fewer than 25 cats. We are making an additional change in proposed andSection; 2.1(a)(3)(iv)to include terms which were inadvertently omitted from the proposal. Thewords ``teaching, or testing'' are added between ``research'' and ``purposes''in the revised rule to make clear that the exemption for sales of fewerthan 25 dogs and/or cats applies to sales for research, teaching, and testingpurposes, in accordance with the purposes of the Act. Five commenters (2 dealers, 1 exhibitor, and 2 members of the general public)stated that an additional exemption from the requirement to obtain a licensefor federal, state, and local parks with free roaming herds of animalsnative to the area which utilize auctions as part of a herd size controlprogram should be added to the regulations. The legislative history ofthe Act indicates that the term ``dealers'' as used in the Act is limitedto private persons and entities and nonprofit or charitable institutions,and does not include federal agencies or political subdivisions of stateor local governments. (<T3>See </T3>Conference Report No. 1848, at p. 9, August 11, 1966.) Thereis no authority under the Act to license federal, state, and local governmentsas dealers, and accordingly no exemptions for them have been provided.One dealer commented that the licensing requirements should be less stringentand should allow more exemptions, such as for brokers and for sales throughclassified ads and publications. The Act includes brokers in the definitionof ``dealer'' by referring to any person who ``negotiates the purchaseor sale'' of any of the covered animals and we are statutorily requiredto license these persons. Furthermore, the Act does not provide an exemptionfrom the licensing requirements for sales accomplished through classifiedads and publications. These sales are ``in commerce'' and are subject tothe Act and regulations. The medium through which a sale is accomplishedis irrelevant so long as it is in commerce. We do not regulate classifiedads or publications; however, we can and do use them to find persons whoshould be licensed in accordance with the regulations. One commenter from the research community sought clarification of the licensingrequirements applicable to research facilities selling animals. Researchfacilities acting as dealers are subject to the same regulations as anyother dealer and must be licensed in accordance with andSection; 2.1, unlessthey are a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States,or of a state or local government, in which case they need not obtain alicense. Three dealers commented that the Department should require anyone sellinganimals at auction sales to obtain a license. We have found that many individualssell a number of animals at auctions during the course of a year. We believethat the proposed exemptions are consistent with the Act and provide appropriatethreshold points for the imposition of the requirement to obtain a license.Moreover, budgetary and personnel restrictions would prevent us from beingable to regulate effectively all of these persons.Similarly, we disagree with the 3 commenters from the general public whostated that the Department should require licensing of all persons whosell or trade animals at flea market operations. The legislative historyof the Act makes clear that the licensing requirement was intended to regulatethe commercial sale or use of animals as part of a business concern. Someanimal sellers at flea markets sell animals as part of a commercial operation,but many others sell them for use as pets or for personal enjoyment. Theproposed licensing requirements and exemptions will still require largevolume or commercial sellers to obtain a license. Three commenters from the research community stated that the Departmentshould delete the requirement that persons who sell exotic or wild animalsbe licensed as dealers. Licensing of these persons is statutorily mandated(7 U.S.C. 2132(f)). One research facility objected to the imposition of dealer licensing requirementson sellers of small quantities of wild animals since research facilitieswould not be able to purchase small quantities of non-domesticated speciesfrom an unlicensed source. The definition of ``dealer'' in the Act permitsan exemption based on dollar amount of sales only for those persons whodo not sell wild animals (or dogs or cats) and therefore persons who sellwild animals must be licensed, regardless of the number of animals theysell (7 U.S.C. 2132(f)(ii)). We require research facilities to purchasethese animals from licensed sources, in accordance with the Act.Proposed andSection; 2.1(b) would eliminate voluntary licenses, except forpersons who sell fewer than 25 dogs or cats per year for research or teachingpurposes. This will prevent people from trying to circumvent certain stateand local community laws concerning keeping dangerous animals. We received2 comments from dealers objecting to the restricted grounds for issuanceof voluntary licenses, and suggesting that people who buy only 1 or 2 animalsas pets or for breeding purposes would have to buy their animals from alicensed dealer, possibly at higher prices. One commenter from the generalpublic commended us for this provision. We believe the dealers' concernis misplaced. It is not the intent of the Act or of the Department to regulatethe acquisition of private pets or animals for personal use and enjoymentBroader use of voluntary licenses requires greater use of the Agency'slimited resources and personnel, which could be utilized more effectivelyby focusing on animals used in commercial or research operations. The regulationfor voluntary licenses remains as proposed, except that reference to the$10 application fee and a provision for annual license fees is includedin paragraph (b) for clarification. Reference to the renewal fee for voluntarylicenses is also included in andSection; 2.1(e)(1) of the revised rule. Annuallicense fees are provided in andSection; 2.6 of the regulations for Class``A,'' Class ``B,'' and Class ``C'' licensees. However, the proposed regulationsinadvertently did not require license fees for voluntary licensees, who,by definition, do not qualify for licensing under any of the Classes. Voluntarylicensees operate most like Class ``A'' licensees, except that they areexempt from the licensing requirements. Accordingly, the annual licensefee for a voluntary license would be that of a Class ``A'' licensee (breeder)under this revised rule. Five commenters (4 exhibitors and l dealer) commented that we should eliminatethe $10 application fee for license renewals required by proposed andSection;2.1(e) and 1 exhibitor suggested having a one-time application fee forthe initial license application required by proposed andSection; 2.1(d),instead of the annual $10 application fee. We believe that it is more equitableto charge licensees on a yearly basis to cover annual processing costs,since a one-time fee could overcharge some and undercharge others. The $10 application fee is also required when a licensee applies for achange in the class of license from that issued to him or her, such asa change from a Class ``A'' to a Class ``B'' license. This is necessarybecause a change in class requires administrative processing that is similarto processing a new application or a renewal application. We have redesignatedproposed paragraph (e) as (e)(1) in the revised rule. We have added a newparagraph (e)(2) to the revised rule and revised andSection; 2.6(a) (``Annuallicensee fees'') to clarify this requirement. We have revised andSection; 2.1(e)(1) to require licensees to submit a completedapplication form with their $10 application fee. We believe that it isnecessary specifically to require submittal of this form along with thefee since many licensees overlook it.Section 2.2 Acknowledgement of regulations and standardsWe are revising andSection; 2.2 so that it applies to applications for licenserenewals, as well as to initial license applications. This change is necessaryto conform with andSection; 2.5, as revised in this rule, which providesthat licenses are valid and effective if renewed, unless terminated, suspended,or revoked.Section 2.3 Demonstration of compliance with standards and regulationsFor the reasons outlined above under the discussion of andSection; 2.1, weare revising proposed andSection; 2.3 in this rule so that it includes applicationsfor license renewals, as well as initial license applications. Accordingly,we have revised paragraph (a) to require that each applicant for a licenseor renewal of a license must demonstrate compliance with the regulationsand standards in Parts 2 and 3 of Subchapter A. We have removed the words,``before a license will be issued'' from the requirement because it appliesto both initial licenses and license renewals. We have revised paragraph(b) to clarify that it only applies to initial license applications. We are revising andSection; 2.3(a) to require each applicant to make hisor her animals, premises, facilities, vehicles, equipment, other premises,and records available for inspection by APHIS officials during businesshours, and at other times mutually agreeable to the applicant and APHIS,rather than ``and/or at other times'' as proposed. We believe this revisionis necessary to prevent licensees from avoiding inspections by being unableto agree to a time with APHIS officials. We received three comments (2 from the general public and 1 from the researchcommunity) expressing support for this section as proposed. Two dealerscommented that we should limit the number of opportunities an applicanthas for inspection to demonstrate their compliance with the regulationsand standards and l also commented that applicants should be required topay the cost of re-inspection. (Demonstration of compliance is a prerequisiteto issuance of a license.) We believe this suggestion has merit and thata limit on inspections should be incorporated in the regulations. Thissection is revised to impose a limit of three pre-licensing inspections.If the applicant is unable to pass inspection after 3 attempts he or shewill forfeit the application fee, to help cover the administrative costof processing their application and the cost of the inspections, and willbe ineligible to reapply for a license for a period of 6 months followingtheir last inspection. As is the case for the prior inspections, the applicantwill be advised of deficiencies and the necessary corrective measures thatmust be taken to comply with the regulations and standards, and accordinglyto pass inspection. We believe that allowing an applicant 3 opportunitiesto pass inspection is reasonable, since it would give the applicant noticeof any deficiencies found by an inspector and a second chance to rectifyany remaining deficiencies found after re-inspection. We also believe thatif an applicant is unable to pass inspection after 3 attempts, 6 monthsprovides sufficient time to enable him or her to take the necessary correctivemeasures which he or she has been unable to provide between the 3 failedinspections. We are not incorporating the suggestion that licensees pay the cost ofre-inspections. The initial application fees and annual fees are intendedto help the federal government defray the cost of program operations. Webelieve that the fees we have assessed are reasonable and equitable forthe nature of the operations being licensed, and have determined at thistime that additional fees are not appropriate.Section 2.4 Non-interference with APHIS officialsUnder proposed andSection; 2.11(a), APHIS would deny a license to any applicantwho ``(6) [h]as interfered with, threatened, abused (including verbal abuse),or harassed any [APHIS official] in the course of carrying out his or herduties.'' As explained below under the subheading, ``andSection; 2.11 Denialof license,'' and in the supplementary information to the proposal of March31, 1987, at 52 FR 10300, we explain that we have determined the need toinclude in the regulations a prohibition against interference with APHISofficials. Also, as explained in greater detail below under that subheading,andSection; 2.11 applies to denial of initial license applications only inthis revised rule, and not to renewals. Based on our experience in enforcementefforts, we have determined that it is necessary to require licensees tocomply with the prohibition against interference and harassment of APHISpersonnel, as well as new applicants. We are therefore removing paragraph(a)(6) from andSection; 2.11 in the final rule and are including its provisionsas andSection; 2.4 in the revised rule so that it is applicable to both initiallicense applicants and licensees.Section 2.5 Duration of license and termination of licenseWe did not receive any comments regarding this section as proposed. Weare revising andSection; 2.5, however, to clarify that licenses are validand effective if renewed each year and have not been terminated, suspended,or revoked. Similarly, we are revising proposed paragraph (b) to referto an application for license renewal. These amendments are necessary toavoid any misconception that every license automatically terminates atthe end of its 1-year term and that each year an applicant must followthe procedure applicable to obtaining an initial license. For this reason,and as previously stated, we are replacing the word ``termination'' with``expiration'' in andSection; 2.5 and all of Subpart A wherever it refersto the calendar end of the 1-year license term.We are making one correction to andSection; 2.5(b) to specify that a licenseewill be notified by ``certified'' mail, rather than first class mail, ofthe expiration date of a license, to ensure that all licensees have noticethat they must renew their license or it will automatically terminate becauseit has expired. Except for nonsubstantive changes made for clarification,the remaining provisions of this section remain as initially proposed.Section 2.6 Annual license feesWe received a number of comments addressing the proposal to increase licensefees. Thirty-seven dealers expressed opposition to yearly license feesin general. Charging license fees is statutorily mandated. Section 23 ofthe Act directs the Secretary to charge and collect reasonable licensefees ``adjusted on an equitable basis taking into consideration the typeand nature of the operations to be licensed * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2153).Nine commenters from the general public and 6 dealers indicated their generalsupport for the increased license fees. One member of the general publicstated that the increases were too low. We received 48 comments (32 dealers,12 exhibitors, and 4 members of the general public) stating that some feeincrease is justified, but that the increases we proposed are too highor too drastic a change from the current fee tables. We received 298 comments(273 from the research community and 25 from members of the general public)stating concern that the fee increases could discourage some small dealersfrom becoming licensed. We have reconsidered the proposed fee structurein light of those comments and are revising them downward as follows: (Forease of comparison, the proposed fees are indicated in parentheses, andthe revised fees are indicated without parentheses.)<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,i1,s25,10,8,5</C><T4> Table</T4> 1._<T4>Dealers, Brokers, and Operators of an Auction Sale_Class ``A'' and``B'' Licenses </T4><H1> Over</H1><H1> But not over</H1><H1> (Fee)</H1><H1> Fee</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">$0<D> $500</D><D> $(50)</D><D> $30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 500<D> 2,000</D><D> (100)</D><D> 60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 2,000<D> 10,000</D><D> (200)</D><D> 120</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 10,000<D> 25,000</D><D> (400)</D><D> 225</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 25,000<D> 50,000</D><D> (600) </D><D>350</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 50,000<D> 100,000</D><D> (800)</D><D> 475</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1"> 100,000<D/>..... <D> (1,000)</D><D> 750</D></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,s25,6,6</C><T4> Table</T4> 2._<T4> Exhibitors_Class ``C'' License </T4><H1> Number of animals</H1><H1> (Fee)</H1><H1> Fee</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 to 5 <D> $(50) </D><D> $30</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 to 25 <D> (125) </D><D> 75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">26 to 50 <D> (250) </D><D> 175</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">51 to 500 <D> (375) </D><D> 225</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">501 and up <D> (500) </D><D> 300</D></ITAG></ITAG>  We believe these fees are a reasonable increase over the existing fees,and that they are equitably adjusted for the different classes of licenseesand for the ranges in dollar volume of business derived from transactionsinvolving animals.We have removed proposed paragraph (b)(4) from andSection; 2.6 in the revisedrule because it could be construed as implying that a dealer can operatewithout a license. This is not the case. Only persons exempt from the licensingrequirements may operate without a license, as provided in andSection; 2.1(a)(3).Proposed paragraphs (b) (5) and (6) are redesignated as paragraphs (b)(4) and (5) in this revised rule.We are revising paragraphs (b) (1) through (5) to clarify that paragraphs(b) (1) through (3) are applicable to license renewals, paragraph (b)(4)is applicable to initial licenses, and paragraph (b)(5) is applicable toboth initial licenses and license renewals.We received 8 comments (4 from exhibitors, 3 from members of the generalpublic, and 1 from a dealer) regarding the division of fees between thelessor and lessee of animals, as provided by proposed andSection; 2.6(b),paragraphs (1), (2), and (5), stating that either the lessor or lesseeshould be responsible for including the revenue from a leased animal indetermining their annual fee, but not both. We disagree with these commentssince both the lessor and lessee derive income from the leased animals.There are two income streams resulting from use of a leased animal, andboth business operations are required to pay a fee which is equitable forthe nature and type of operation it is. Also, both the lessor and lesseeare licensed, and thereby impose costs on the Department to ensure compliancewith the regulations and standards. We believe it is proper to requireboth the lessor and lessee to include their respective income from an animalin determining their annual fee.We also received 4 comments from the research community and 2 from membersof the public suggesting the need to code animals leased to research facilitiesas a tracing mechanism to ensure that the animals are not used for morethan one major operative procedure from which they are allowed to recover.We consider this requirement to be unwarranted since, to the best of ourknowledge, animals are rarely, if ever, leased for research purposes. Weare not making any changes in andSection; 2.6 based upon this comment.We are making one change in paragraph (d) for clarification. Paragraph(d) provides that if a person meets the licensing requirements for morethan one class of license, he must pay the fee for his predominant typeof business, as determined by the Secretary. The clarification will addthat in addition to the fee paid, the class of license that person mustobtain will be determined by his or her predominant type of business, sincea person cannot have more than one license in accordance with andSection;2.1(c). The words ``obtain a license and'' are added following ``he shallbe required to.'' We are revising the rule to refer to both masculine andfeminine genders. Accordingly, ``he'' is replaced with ``he or she'' inandSection; 2.6(d) and throughout the revised rule. Similarly, ``his'' isreplaced with ``his or her'' wherever it appears.Section 2.7 Annual report by licenseesWe are revising proposed andSection; 2.7 to clarify that it applies to licenserenewals only, and not to initial license applications.Proposed andSection; 2.7(a) would provide as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Each year, within 30 days prior to the termination date of his/herlicense, a licensee shall file with the Area Veterinarian in Charge anapplication for license and annual report upon a form which will be furnishedto him upon request to the Area Veterinarian in Charge. When the requirementsof andSection;andSection; 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, and 2.6 have been met, the licensewill be issued subject to the exceptions in andSection;andSection; 2.5, 2.10,and 2.11.</ITAG>We are revising proposed andSection; 2.7(a) to refer only to license renewalsand the requirement that licensees submit an annual report in order torenew their license. In this revised rule, we refer to the expiration dateof the license and have replaced ``license'' with ``license renewal.''We are also removing the last sentence of proposed andSection; 2.7(a) becauseit refers to requirements applicable to issuance of an initial license,and these are set forth in andSection; 2.1(d).Three dealers and 1 exhibitor commented that clarification is needed concerningrequirements to include statements about young animals in their annualreports and in other reports. The requirement to identify all dogs andcats when obtained or when weaned is set forth in proposed andSection; 2.50.All animals must be identified in the licensee's records at his or herfacility when born or obtained from outside the premises, in accordancewith proposed andSection;andSection; 2.75 and 2.77. Proposed andSection; 2.7(d)would require exhibitors (Class ``C'' licensees) to include in their annualreport the number of animals owned, held, or exhibited by the licenseeeither during the previous year or at the time of signing the annual report,whichever is greater. The figure used must include all animals regardlessof age, and is the basis for determining the Class ``C'' license fee. Wedo not believe this requirement needs further elaboration in the regulations.We received 8 comments (4 exhibitors, 3 dealers, 1 from the research community)objecting to the requirement provided in proposed andSection; 2.7(e) forlicensees to have the attending veterinarian certify in the licensee'sannual report that the attending veterinarian understands the regulationsand standards under the Act, and that he or she has visited the premisesand carried out the responsibilities indicated in the regulations and inthe written program of adequate veterinary care. The commenters statedthat the requirement to have a written program of veterinary care as providedin proposed andSection; 2.40 is sufficient. We agree that the attending veterinarianshould not be required to sign the licensee's annual report in light ofthe requirements in proposed andSection; 2.40 that licensees maintain a writtenprogram of adequate veterinary care which is subject to inspection at thelicensee's facility and is sent to the Area Veterinarian in Charge eachyear. We have therefore deleted this requirement from the revised rule.Section 2.8 Notification of change of name, address, control, or ownershipof business We have made one correction in this section. The phrase ``or by any additionalsites'' should read ``or of any additional sites * * *.'' We received nocomments addressing this section and have made no other substantive changes.Section 2.10 Licensees whose licenses have been suspended or revoked Two dealers commented in opposition to our proposal to make license revocationspermanent. We were urged to allow the facts and circumstances surroundingthe offense leading to revocation to be taken into consideration in determiningthe appropriate amount of time a former licensee must wait before he orshe could apply for a new license, instead of being permanently ineligible.We disagree with these comments. Whether a license should be suspendedor revoked is determined after notice and a hearing. Testimony as to thefacts and circumstances surrounding the offense would be brought out atthe hearing. In such an administrative proceeding conducted in accordancewith the Department's Rules of Practice, revocation would be ordered forserious offenses which are determined to warrant this sanction, as comparedto suspension, which could be ordered for a stated period of time for lessserious offenses. We believe that the commenters' concerns that the factsand circumstances be considered would be amply addressed in the requiredhearing. Accordingly, revocation of a license will remain a permanent sanction.As discussed below under the next subheading, we are adding to andSection;2.10(a) the provision from proposed andSection; 2.11(b) stating that anyperson whose license has been suspended may reapply for a license afterthe period of suspension is ended. We are revising it, however, to providethat any person whose license has been suspended may apply to the AreaVeterinarian in Charge, in writing, for reinstatement of his or her license,rather than having to reapply for a new license. No other substantive changesare made in this section. Section 2.11 Denial of license The comments we received addressing proposed andSection; 2.11 deal principallywith existing licenses, convincing us of the need to separate the provisionsconcerning denial of initial license applications from provisions concerningsuspended or revoked licenses. We are discussing those comments in thisdiscussion of ``andSection; 2.11, Denial of license,'' since readers whoare more interested in the substance of proposed andSection; 2.11 than thatof andSection; 2.10, and who may have commented specifically with regardto andSection; 2.11, may look to this heading for our response instead ofthe heading, ``andSection; 2.10 Licensees whose licenses have been suspendedor revoked.'' Many of the comments we received concerning proposed andSection; 2.11 addresseddue process issues which would be raised if we suspended or revoked a license.As should be clear from the supplementary information, paragraph (a) andmost of paragraph (b) of this section are concerned with denial of initiallicense applications, and do not have any bearing on suspension or revocationof existing licenses. We have renamed this section ``Denial of initiallicense applications'' to avoid any further confusion. Paragraphs (b) and (c) refer to both suspended licenses and denials oflicense applications. For purposes of clarity, we are removing the referenceto suspended licenses from andSection; 2.11. Accordingly, paragraphs (b)and (c) will address denial of initial license applications exclusively.The content of proposed andSection; 2.11(b) with regard to suspended licenseshas been added to andSection; 2.10(a) in the revised rule, and that of andSection;2.11(c) is already contained in andSection; 2.10(a) so there is no need forfurther revision. We received several comments objecting to the proposed reasons for whichwe would deny a license application and to this section in general. Thirty-threecommenters from the research community stated that a plea of nolo contendere(no contest) under state or local cruelty to animals laws within 1 yearof application for a license should not be an automatic basis for denialof a license, since a licensee may elect to enter this plea rather thana plea of not guilty, to avoid the time and expense of a full hearing onthe charge. In light of this comment, we are revising the rule to providethat if no penalty is imposed as a result of a plea of nolo contendere,the applicant may reapply immediately without having to wait a year. Webelieve this will accommodate those persons who exercise their rights toenter this plea, while allowing the Administrator to deny a license topersons involved in violations of the cruelty to animals laws. We received 366 comments (321 from the research community, 11 from dealers,7 from exhibitors, and 27 from members of the general public) opposingsubparagraph (6) as a basis for denial of a license. A similar prohibitionagainst interfering with, threatening, abusing, or harassing any APHISofficial in the course of carrying out his or her duties is provided inandSection; 2.4 in the revised rule. Accordingly, we have added andSection;2.4 to andSection; 2.11(a)(1) in the revised rule so that it remains a basisfor denial of a license. As proposed, subparagraph (6) would provide thata license will not be issued to any applicant who ``[h]as interfered with,threatened, abused (including verbal abuse), or harassed any VeterinaryServices inspector in the course of carrying out his/her duties.'' Thecomments stated that this is too ambiguous and subjective a basis for denyingor revoking a license. We are retaining this basis for denial of a licensebecause we have determined a geuuine need for it, based upon our experiencein enforcing the regulations. First, adequate safeguards against subjectivedeterminations are contained in andSection; 2.11(b) as proposed. which providesthat an applicant whose application is denied may request a hearing inaccordance with the applicable rules of practice. At a hearing, the Departmentwould have to support its denial of an application in accordance with therules of practice and would have to show that it is reasonable and notarbitrary and capricious. We believe this is sufficient to avoid subjectivityor arbitrariness from entering into the determination. Second, andSection;2.11 applies to denial of an application for a license, not suspensionor revocation of an issued license. Suspension and revocation proceduresinclude notice and hearing and must satisfy the requirements of due processof law. We received 318 comments (282 from the research community, 10 dealers,and 26 members of the general public) objecting to proposed paragraph (b)of andSection; 2.11 which provides that the denial of a license would remainin effect until a final legal decision is made following a hearing, onthe basis that this could deprive a person of their livelihood for yearsbefore they receive the benefit of due process of law. As explained above, this section applies to initial license applications,not to renewals of existing licenses. Suspension and revocation of an issuedlicense would be in accordance with the requirements of the applicableDepartmental rules of practice. Except as previously noted, paragraph (b)remains as initially proposed. We received 303 comments (278 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to proposed andSection; 2.11(c), which providesthat a legal entity in which a person whose license application has been[suspended or] denied has a substantial interest, financial or otherwise,will not be licensed within 1 year of the denial [or until completion ofthe suspension period]. (The bracketed provisions refer to suspended licensesand are contained in andSection; 2.10(a) in the final rule). One commenter was concerned that the regulation as proposed could preventa facility from being licensed for a year simply because one of its shareholdershad been denied a license. We do not believe this concern is well-founded,as the regulation is limited to legal entities in which a person whoseapplication has been denied has a ``substantial'' interest. This may ormay not apply to a shareholder, depending upon that person's interest.We do not agree with the commenter that the proposed restriction shouldapply only if that person has a ``substantial interest, financial or otherwise,and responsibility for the operation or management of the applicant.''Licenses can be issued at the lowest level of legal entity, that is, toindividuals. Any person who was engaged in activity serious enough to warrantdenial of a license application should not be allowed to continue in operationunder the umbrella of another legal entity in which they can exercise<T3> any</T3> measure of control and can influence operations. This iswhat the proposed regulation is intended to prevent. A similar provisionhas been included in the regulations since 1970 without problems or objections,and it remains in this revised rule. Except for deletion of referencesto suspension of licenses which are covered by andSection; 2.10, paragraph(c) remains as initially proposed.  We received 7 comments from the general public stating that the proposedregulations concerning denial and revocation of licenses are too lenienton facilities and on individuals and should be more stringent. We haveattempted to strengthen the regulations in areas we believe will enhanceour enforcement efforts. We believe that the regulations as proposed andas revised in this rule provide sufficient bases upon which to deny, suspend,or revoke licenses, and will assist us in handling noncompliance and otherproblematic situations we have encountered in regulating licensees.  Except for the changes described above, Subpart A_Licensing remains inthe revised rule as originally proposed.  Subpart B_Registration  Proposed andSection; 2.28, ``Annual report of research facilities,'' isredesignated andSection; 2.31 in this revised rule. Comments received addressingproposed andSection; 2.28 are discussed under the heading, ``Subpart C_InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee and Other Requirements for Research Facilities,''subheading, ``Proposed andSection; 2.28 Annual report of research facilities.''Section 2.25 Requirements and procedures  We received 299 comments (274 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) stating that andSection; 2.25 as proposedis generally acceptable. Commenters who addressed the proposed registrationrequirements and procedures were concerned with the requirement that registrantsupdate their registration form every 3 years. As explained in the supplementaryinformation to the proposed rule, this requirement is new to the AnimalWelfare regulations. We received 122 comments from the research communityand l from a member of the general public stating that renewal of registrationshould be required every 5 years to coincide with the U.S. Public HealthService current requirement for the submission of assurance statementsunder the Health Research Extension Act of 1985. Five commenters from theresearch community stated more generally that the proposed requirementsshould coincide with those of the PHS. The proposed 3-year time periodcorresponds with other federal recordkeeping requirements, most notablythe USDA records retention and disposition policy, making it the most practicalinterval for us to administer. The PHS requirement for submission of assurances<T3> up to</T3> every 5 years is not inconsistent with the 3-year periodwe proposed. We have consulted with representatives from HHS specificallyon this point, and they have indicated their willingness to abide by the3-year registration renewal period as proposed. Accordingly, we are retainingthe requirement for renewal of registration every 3 years.  We received one comment from a member of the research community requestingclarification regarding the requirement for registration by federal researchfacilities. We received another comment from a member of the research communityrequesting clarification of proposed andSection; 2.25, generally. In responseto the first comment, we are clarifying the section to state that federalresearch facilities are not required to register with the Secretary underthe regulations. In response to the second comment, we note that exceptfor provisions requiring research facilities to update their registrationevery 3 years, andSection; 2.25 as proposed is substantially the same asit has been since 1967. We have experienced few problems in applying itsrequirements since that time, and we do not believe clarification is necessary. Except for the clarification regarding federal research facilities, nochanges are made in andSection; 2.25 in the revised rule. Section 2.26 Acknowledgement of regulations and standards  Proposed andSection; 2.26 provides as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"> A copy of the regulations and standards in this Subchapter will besupplied with each registration form. The registrant shall acknowledgereceipt of such regulations and standards and agree to comply with themby signing a form provided for such purpose by Veterinary Services. Suchform shall be filed with the Area Veterinarian in Charge.</ITAG> We received 299 comments (274 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) stating that this section as proposed isgenerally acceptable. One commenter stated that it should be deleted fromthe regulations. The required acknowledgement is necessary to ensure thatregistrants have knowledge of the regulations and standards with whichthey must comply. A similar provision is contained in Subpart A_``Licensing''for the same reason. We believe that the acknowledgement should remainin the regulations.  One commenter requested general publication and distribution of the AnimalWelfare Manual and applicable Veterinary Services Memoranda. These areinternal USDA, APHIS documents intended to assist APHIS inspectors. Theydo not contain ``rules of general applicability'' and accordingly, thereis no need to publish them in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as part of the regulations. The proposed section is substantially the same as current andSection; 2.26.It remains as proposed. Section 2.27 Notification of change of operation Proposed paragraph (a) of andSection; 2.27 requires that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[a] registrant shall notify the Area Veterinarian in Charge by certifiedmail of any change in the name or address, or any change in the operationsor business, which would affect its status as a research facility, exhibitor,carrier, or intermediate handler, within 10 days after making such change.</ITAG> We received 422 comments (397 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) objecting that proposed andSection; 2.27(a)is too broad. We received 295 comments (270 from the research communityand 25 from members of the general public) expressing concern that thesupplementary information is inconsistent with the proposed regulationbecause it is broader than the proposed regulation. The supplementary informationaccompanying Subpart B ``Registration'' states that notification is required``of any change in address, operations or management.'' The commentersexpressed concern that the preamble language would encompass personnelor management changes which do not affect the information required by theregistration form. Another commenter was concerned that the preamble impliedthat failure to report minor management or operations changes would bea violation of the regulations, and that clarification to avoid difficultiesin interpreting this requirement is necessary. We are in agreement withthese comments and are adopting the clarification suggested by a commenter,to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">A registrant shall notify the Area Veterinarian in Charge by certifiedmail of any change in the name, address, or ownership, or other changein operations affecting its status as a research facility, exhibitor, carrier,or intermediate handler,   * * *.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">This revision should clarify that notification is required for operationalchanges which affect this registrant's status as a registered entity, inaddition to name and address changes. This requirement will assist us inkeeping accurate records on current registrants, and avoid wasting Agencyresources when a registrant has gone out of business or has changed itsoperations. We received 302 comments (277 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) stating that notification should be requiredwithin 30 days instead of the 10 days proposed. The 10-day period is inthe current regulations and has been in the regulations since they werefirst issued. It has caused no problems or difficulties and is a sufficientamount of time within which affected facilities can report. We are thereforeretaining it in the regulations. Except for the change in paragraph (a) set forth above, andSection; 2.27remains in the revised rule as initially proposed.Subpart C_Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and Other Requirementsfor Research Facilities <ITAG tagnum="81">Introduction </ITAG>Proposed Subpart C elicited numerous and varied comments addressing theproper role, duties, and authority of Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittees (``Committees'') and research institutions in promoting animalwelfare. Many of the commenters expressed particular concern that the proposedregulations placed responsibilities on the Committee and on the attendingveterinarian (Subpart D) that they believed should lie with the institution.There was also concern that APHIS was improperly placing the Committeeand the attending veterinarian in the position of whistleblower and enforcerof the Animal Welfare regulations. Research facilities have been required, through their animal care committeeand/or attending veterinarian, to provide guidelines and consultation totheir research personnel regarding the use of pain relieving drugs sincethe regulations were revised in accordance with the 1970 amendments tothe Act. They have also been required to have a program of adequate veterinarycare established and maintained under the supervision and guidance of aveterinarian. The 1985 amendments to the Act placed special significanceon these institutional personnel as a means of assuring animal welfare,and represented a significant departure from the then-existing Act. Theclear message from Congress was that additional regulatory efforts areneeded to enhance animal welfare, to minimize animal pain and distressin research, and to restrict the multiple use of animals in major operativeexperiments. For the first time, Congress legislated that all researchfacilities must have an ``Institutional Animal Committee'' of a statutorilyprescribed composition with inspection and reporting duties (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)).Similar committees are already in place at research facilities receivinggrant monies and awards from the U.S. Public Health Service under the HealthResearch Extension Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-158, for research, training,and biological testing activities involving animals. Congress also mandatedin the 1985 amendments to the Act that research facilities provide trainingto scientists, animal technicians, and other personnel involved with animalcare and treatment. The Act retained the requirement that the facilitiesprovide assurances they are adhering to the standards promulgated underthe Act, and requires that they provide an explanation for any deviationfrom those standards. The 1985 amendments to the Act continue the Secretary'sauthority ``to promulgate such rules, regulations, and orders as he maydeem necessary in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act.'' (7 U.S.C.2151). The legislative history of the 1985 amendments to the Act demonstratesthat at least one significant proponent in the Senate was of the view that``[v]eterinary inspectors from the U.S. Department of Agriculture cannotbe present on a daily basis. However, their enforcement capability canand should be enhanced by the Institutional Animal Committee * * *.'' SenateMajority Leader Dole's statement, <T3>Congressional Record, </T3>December 18, 1985, at p. S17943. As part of our response to the mandate from Congress, we proposed threenew sections, andSection;andSection; 2.30, 2.35, and 2.40, to implement the1985 amendments to the Act. Section 2.30 sets forth responsibilities andrequirements specifically imposed upon research facilities. Section 2.35details the responsibilities and duties of the Institutional Animal Careand Use Committee which each research facility must establish. Section2.40 details the requirement imposed upon all registrants and licenseesto provide and maintain a program of adequate veterinary care and the requirementsimposed upon attending veterinarians. This section consolidates the veterinarycare regulations currently contained in each subpart of Part 3 and imposesadditional requirements based upon the 1985 amendments to the Act. <ITAG tagnum="81">Reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35 </ITAG>Many comments we received were critical of the allocation of certain dutiesand responsibilities to the Committee and attending veterinarian ratherthan to the facility. Most of the comments we received were from membersof the research community, the group most affected by the regulations proposedin Subpart C. Unless otherwise indicated, the comments addressed belowwere received from members of the research community. Sixty-one commenters stated that too much authority would be given to theattending veterinarian and the Committee under the proposed regulations.We also received 400 comments (375 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) objecting that the proposed regulationswould place too much responsibility on the attending veterinarian and theCommittee. Particular duties and areas of responsibility proposed in theregulations were singled out by the commenters as being improper and inappropriate.The statutory language and the legislative history of the 1985 amendmentsto the Act support our proposal to impose various duties and responsibilitieson the Committee and on the attending veterinarian. We agree, however,with the commenters that the ultimate responsibility for animal welfareat research facilities rests with the institutions themselves. We havecarefully considered the comments we received, and have determined to reorganizeand restructure portions of Subpart C in this revised rule to place responsibilityon the research facilities, except where it is expressly reserved by theAct to the Committee. Similarly, we have revised portions of Subpart Dconcerning the requirement for a program of adequate veterinary care atresearch facilities to reflect that many of its aspects are the responsibilityof the research facility, unless otherwise required by the Act. Those areas of responsibility that are reassigned to the research facilitiesin the revised rule are described below under subject headings for easeof reference. We address the comments we received concerning the substanceof the proposed provisions, as opposed to the allocation of responsibilityfor them, following this discussion. The following chart provides the derivation of the paragraphs containedin andSection; 2.30 in the final rule, as an additional aid to the reader.The paragraphs listed under the heading, ``Revised rule'' were derivedfrom the corresponding paragraphs listed under the heading, ``Proposedrule.''<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,xs60,r25 </C><T4>Derivation Table </T4><H1>Revised rule </H1><H1>Proposed rule</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(a) <D>andSection; 2.30(a) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(b) <D>andSection; 2.30(b) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(c) <D>andSection; 2.30(c) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(d) <D>andSection; 2.30(d) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(1) <D>andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(v)(A), (B) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(2) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(e)(1) and 2.35(b)(3) (vi)(A) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(3) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(e)(2) and 2.35(b)(3)(iv) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(4) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iv), (vi)(F) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(5) <D>andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(B) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(6) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(e)(3) and 2.35(b)(3) (vi)(C) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(7) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(e)(3) and 2.35(b)(3) (vi)(D) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(8) <D>andSection; 2.30(b)(3)(vi)(D) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(9) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(e)(4) and 2.35(b)(3) (vi)(E) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(e)(10) <D>andSection; 2.30(e) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(f) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(f) and 2.35(b)(3) (vii)(A)-(G) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(g) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.30(g) and 2.35(c) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(h) <D>andSection; 2.35(d) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(i) <D>andSection; 2.35(f) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(j) <D>andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(iii) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(k) <D>andSection; 2.35(e) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(l) <D>andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(i) </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">andSection; 2.30(m) <D>andSection;andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i), (iv)</D></ITAG></ITAG> 1. <T3>Training. </T3>Section 13(d) of the Act requires the research facilityto train personnel involved with animal care and treatment (7 U.S.C. 2143(d)).We had proposed in andSection; 2.35(f) that each research facility providetraining for personnel in animal use, care, and treatment and that thistraining be provided through the Committee and the attending veterinarian.The Committee would review the training and designate those personnel requiringadditional training, and the training program would include instructionin certain prescribed areas as well as in other areas the Committee mayfeel is necessary. We received 487 comments (462 from the research communityand 25 from members of the general public) stating that these trainingrequirements should not be included in andSection; 2.35 since they are thefacility's responsibility, not the Committee's. We agree that trainingis ultimately the responsibility of the facility. The Act does not reservethe training requirement to the Committee. Accordingly, in the revisedrule we have removed training from andSection; 2.35 and have included itin andSection; 2.30(i) as a requirement for research facilities.2. <T3>Procedures for personnel to report violations. </T3>Thirty-two commentersfrom the research community objected to the requirement contained in proposedandSection; 2.35(b)(2)(iii) that the Committee establish procedures for personnelto report violations of the regulations or standards, including problems,deviations, or deficiencies with animal housing, care, or use. As proposed,the Committee would also review and investigate reports, if warranted,and file a report. The commenters stated that the duty to establish theseprocedures should be imposed upon the research institution, and not theCommittee. We agree that this requirement is not imposed upon the Committeeby the Act and we therefore are including it in andSection; 2.30(j) of therevised rule as the facility's responsibility. We continue to believe,however, that the Committee is the appropriate body to review and investigateany reports received because it is established to assess animal care anduse and because it has inspection authority under the Act and the regulations.We are retaining that allocation of authority as proposed. The report preparedas a result of the Committee's review would be filed at the same centrallocation as those prepared as part of the Committee's semiannual inspections.3. <T3>Response to Agency requests for information. </T3>We received two commentsobjecting to proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(i) which would require the Committeeto respond to requests from the Deputy Administrator [Administrator] tomake research protocols [ACUPs] involving animals and assurance statementsavailable to the Agency. The commenters stated that this should be theresponsibility of the research facility, not the Committee. We agree thatthe research facility is ultimately accountable for responding to officialDepartment requests, and we are including responsibility for doing so inandSection; 2.30(1) of the revised rule as an additional requirement forresearch facilities. As explained in the revised rule for Part 1 publishedelsewhere in this issue, research protocol is changed to ACUP and DeputyAdministrator is changed to Administrator. (<T3>See </T3>companion docket no. 88-013.) 4. <T3>Use of pain relieving drugs. </T3>Similarly, although we did not receiveany comments regarding proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iv), which requiresthe Committee to ensure that pain relieving drugs are used whenever ananimal is involved in a painful procedure, the ultimate responsibilityfor this assurance lies with the facility and we are therefore includingthis requirement in andSection; 2.30(e) in the revised rule. 5. <T3>Painful procedures. </T3>Ninety-four commenters from the research communityobjected to Committee responsibility for requiring certain assurances andconduct when painful procedures will be performed, as proposed in andSection;2.35(b)(3)(v) through (vii). Paragraph (v) of proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)provides that the Committee shall require written assurances from the principalinvestigator that alternative procedures were considered for a procedurelikely to cause pain or distress, that there are no other suitable procedures,and that the experiment is not unnecessarily duplicative. Paragraph (vi)of proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3) provides that the Committee must requirethat certain conditions are followed in any practice which could be expectedto cause pain to animals. Paragraph (vii) of proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)would require the Committee to asssure that no animal is used in more thanone major operative experiment from which it is allowed to recover, exceptin certain circumstances. Again, research facilities are ultimately responsiblefor these assurances and for compliance with the requirements set forthin andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(v) through (vii) as part of its operations. Becausethe Act does not specifically impose these duties on the Committee, weare placing them in paragraphs (e) and (f) of andSection; 2.30 in the revisedrule, as additional requirements for research facilities. 6. <T3>Exceptions.</T3> We did not receive any comments specifically addressingproposed andSection; 2.35(c), which provides that exceptions to compliancewith the Animal Welfare regulations and standards shall be made by theCommittee only when necessary for the research design and they are specifiedin the protocol [ACUP]. A similar provision is contained in proposed andSection;2.30(g) with regard to painful procedures and major operative experimentsfrom which an animal is allowed to recover. Under both sections, the principalinvestigator would be required to file a report with the Committee explainingany areas of noncompliance. A copy of the report must be kept on file bythe facility and made available for Agency inspection or to officials ofgranting agencies. These provisions are set out in paragraphs (f) and (g)of andSection; 2.30 in the revised rule, as the research facility is ultimatelyresponsible for any exceptions to the Act and regulations, although exceptionsmust be approved by the Committee. 7. <T3>Written procedures for exercise for dogs and for the psychologicalwell-being of nonhuman primates. </T3>We received 301 comments (276 fromthe research community and 25 from members of the general public) statingthat the responsibility for carrying out the requirements of proposed andSection;2.35(d) should be imposed on the research facilities, and not the Committee.Thirty-five commenters similarly stated that the responsibility shouldbe imposed on the research facility, which can then delegate authorityto the Committee to carry out the requirements. Proposed andSection; 2.35(d) provides as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Committee shall establish, in consultation with the attendingveterinarian, written procedures and systems for the exercise of dogs andfor the psychological well-being of primates in accordance with the regulationsand standards, and a record system indicating that such a procedure orsystem is being carried out.</ITAG>Again, the Committee is not required by the Act to establish these procedures,although it is required to inspect for compliance with the Act. Therefore,we are including the substance of proposed andSection; 2.35(d) in andSection;2.30(h) as a requirement for research facilities in the revised rule. 8. <T3>Federal research facilities. </T3>The requirements contained in proposedandSection; 2.35(e) ``Federal research facilities,'' have also been movedto andSection; 2.30 in the revised rule since they are a responsibility ofa research facility, albeit a federal research facility, and not the Committee.9. <T3>Proposed </T3>andSection; 2.35(g) ``Annual report of research facility''requires the Committee Chairman to sign an assurance statement on the AnnualReport (VS Form 18-23) certifying that the Committee has carried out theresponsibilities and requirements of andSection; 2.35, that the facilityis in compliance with the Animal Welfare standards, that the Committeehas required a detailed explanation to be provided by the principal investigatorwhen pain relieving drugs are withheld, that all explanations are attachedto the annual report, and that the Committee has required that all otherexceptions to the standards be required by research protocol [ACUP] andapproved by the Committee. We received 49 comments stating that the responsibleinstitutional official with authority to bind the facility should be requiredto sign the statement, not the Committee Chairman, since the provisionof an adequate animal care and use program is the facility's responsibility.Twenty-nine commenters cited the assurance required in andSection; 2.28(b)(9),``Annualreport of research facilities,'' and objected that the additional assuranceof the Committee Chairman required in proposed andSection; 2.35(g) is redundantand outside the authority of the Act.As discussed under the heading ``Subpart B_Registration,'' in this finalrule, only the responsible institutional official with authority to bindthe facility will be required to sign the annual report. That officialmay in turn require assurances from the Committee of the kind proposedin andSection; 2.35(g), however, we are not requiring them in the facility'sannual report The substance of the assurances that were required of theCommittee Chairman in proposed andSection; 2.35(g) will be deleted from thatsection and required instead in andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(D) of the revisedrule, as part of the Committee's report.Subpart C of the revised rule has been rewritten to reflect that the areasof responsibility described above have been reassigned and are part ofthe requirements imposed upon research facilities. Comments we receivedaddressing the substance of the proposed provisions of Subpart C, as opposedto comments addressing responsibility for those areas, are discussed belowin the order in which those provisions appear in the revised rule. We believethat discussing the comments in this manner will help guide the readerthrough the substance of the revised rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">General</ITAG>We received 301 comments (276 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that this subpart should include standardswhich apply only to research facilities. Subpart C as proposed does applyonly to research facilities and we do not find any ambiguity in eitherthe heading or in the requirements themselves to cause the commenters tobelieve otherwise. We received 28 comments from the research communitysuggesting that we revise or delete the portions of Subpart C which addressthe formation and regulation of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees.We partially agree with this comment and, as explained above, have revisedandSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35 which comprise Subpart C to reallocateauthority and duties between the institution and the Committee so thatthe Committee will have only those specifically imposed upon it by theAct.Seventy commenters suggested that the term ``protocol'' which appears inthis section be changed to conform with the U. S. Public Health Serviceterminology which refers to ``animal use procedure.'' As stated in thesupplementary information accompanying the revised rule for Part 1_``Definitionof Terms,'' published elsewhere in this issue (<T3>see </T3>companion docket no. 88-013), under the heading, ``Protocol,''the term ``protocol'' is changed to ``animal care and use procedure'' andis referred to in this document as the ACUP. The comments we received referto ``research protocols'' as that term was used in the proposed rule. Theterm ``research protocol'' is used in this document when it is necessaryto understand the substance of the comment. In those instances, ACUP appearsin brackets following the term. In all other instances, we refer to theanimal care and use procedure (ACUP).Certain of the requirements pertaining to research facilities containedin andSection;andSection; 2.30, 2.35, and 2.40 require that written policiesand procedures be established. These include a written policy for any practicewhich might reasonably be expected to cause pain to an animal (proposedandSection; 2.30(e)), written procedures and systems for the exercise ofdogs and for the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates (proposedandSection; 2.35(d)), and a written program of adequate veterinary care (proposedandSection; 2.40(c)). (The requirement for a written program of adequateveterinary care applies to dealers and licensees, as well as to researchfacilities.) Research facilities that utilize written standard operatingprocedures (SOP) may satisfy these requirements by including the writtenpolicies and procedures in their SOPs.Section 2.30 Additional requirements for research facilitiesSection 2.30(a). Thirty commenters suggested that paragraph (a) of andSection;2.30 should specifically reference research facilities using or holdinganimals for experimentation, in addition to those using or holding animalsfor ``research, testing, or teaching'' as proposed. We did not proposeto include separately ``experimentation'' since it is generally consideredto be covered by the term ``research.'' Section 2 of the Act defines ``researchfacility'' as one which, among other things, uses live animals in ``research,tests, or experiments * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2132). Since the Act enumeratesthese functions, we agree that the regulations should as well. Section2.30(a) is therefore revised by adding ``experimentation'' following ``research.''We received 131 comments objecting to the requirement contained in proposedandSection; 2.30(a)(2) that research facilities ensure that adequate veterinarycare, including the appropriate use of drugs or euthanasia, is providedfor at all times. We disagree with these commenters. We believe this requirementis necessary in order to fulfill the requirement of the Act that adequateveterinary care be provided at all times by research facilities (7 U.S.C.2143(a)(3)(A). Section 2.30(a)(2) remains in the revised rule as initiallyproposed.The requirements for adequate veterinary care are provided in Subpart D-``AttendingVeterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care.'' We are also adding a new paragraph(a)(3) to andSection; 2.30 to state that research facilities are requiredto establish and maintain a written program of adequate veterinary care,in accordance with andSection; 2.40. Proposed paragraph (a)(3) is redesignated(a)(4) in the revised rule.<T3>Section 2.30(b).</T3> We received 322 comments (297 from the researchcommunity and 25 from members of the general public) stating that the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee which andSection; 2.30(b) requires to be establishedand maintained should be renamed the ``Institutional Animal Committee''to be consistent with the Act. For the reasons explained under the heading,``Committee,'' in the supplementary information to the revised rule forPart 1_``Definition of Terms,'' published elsewhere in this issue of the<T4>Federal Register </T4> (<T3>see</T3> companion docket no. 88-013), we have determined that ``InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee'' is more appropriate since it is descriptiveof the areas of concern to the Committee and is consistent with the terminologyused by the Public Health Service, National Institutes of Health, whichutilizes similar committees. No change is made to the name of the Committeein the revised rule.<T3>Section 2.30(c).</T3> As proposed, andSection; 2.30(c) would requireresearch facilities to ``provide the Committee and the attending veterinarianwith the authority to enter all animal areas at any reasonable time inorder to carry out their responsibilities.'' We received 535 comments (510from the research community and 25 from members of the general public)objecting to this requirement on the grounds that it exceeds our statutoryauthority, could interfere with research, and could lead to unauthorizedrelease of proprietary information. We believe these concerns are unwarranted.First, statutory authority exists: the Act directs the Secretary to promulgatestandards with respect to animals in research facilities, to include requirementsfor animal care, treatment, and practices to ensure pain and distress areminimized, for adequate veterinary care with appropriate use of drugs,for consideration of alternatives to any painful procedure, for consultationwith a doctor of veterinary medicine in the planning of painful procedures,and for ensuring that an animal is not used in more than one major operativeexperiment from which it is allowed to recover except if scientificallynecessary (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)). The Act specifically authorizes the Committee,of which the attending veterinarian is a member, to conduct inspectionsof research facilities, to review practices involving animals and the conditionof animals, and to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Act tominimize pain and distress to animals (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(3)). Section 21of the Act authorizes the Secretary to ``promulgate such rules, regulations,and orders as he may deem necessary in order to effectuate the purposesof [the] Act.'' (7 U.S.C. 2151).Second, concerns that inspections at any time could interfere with ongoingresearch and with research results by disturbing the animals or upsettingthe controlled environment could be allayed by providing guidelines forconducting inspections in the facility's written policies and procedures.In this manner, facility personnel, including Committee members and theattending veterinarian, will be informed of any necessary and reasonablerestrictions on the timing of inspections before any are performed underthese regulations. The establishment of guidelines would help reassureresearch personnel that the inspection regulations are implemented in goodfaith. We caution, however, that they must not be used as a means of preventinginspections during research, surgery, or other procedures.Third, regarding release of trade secret or proprietary information, thescientific or proprietary portion of ongoing research is not the subjectof inspection. Moreover, even if trade secrets or proprietary informationwere apparent on physical inspection, Section 27 of the Act makes it unlawfulfor any member of the Committee to release any confidential informationof the research facility, including trade secrets, and provides sanctionsfor violations (7 U.S.C. 2157). This statutory deterrent should alleviateconcerns about the unauthorized release of proprietary information.It is necessary that the Committee be assured free access to all animalareas to perform its responsibilities and duties properly. Access to allanimal areas at any reasonable time to conduct inspections as the Committeedeems appropriate must be assured in order to effectuate the purposes ofthe Act and as a means of promoting compliance with the Act and the regulationsbetween Committee inspections. Reports are not a substitute for first-handobservation of animal care to ensure compliance.We are revising andSection; 2.30(c) in the revised rule to require that eachresearch facility must also provide the attending veterinarian with theauthority to enter all animal areas at any time, to ensure compliance withthe facility's program of adequate care. As explained in greater detailbelow under the heading, ``Subpart D_Attending Veterinarian and AdequateVeterinary Care,'' this access is necessary to enable attending veterinariansto perform their duties as intended by the Act. Section 2.30(c) is revisedto reflect this change.<T3>Section 2.30(d).</T3> Proposed andSection; 2.30(d) would require Committeeapproval only for research protocols [ACUPs] falling under Categories 3and 4 of the ``Categories of Animal Use in Research and Teaching'' in proposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(ii). which categorize procedures according to thedegree of animal pain or distress involved. Procedures that involve ``significantbut unavoidable pain or distress to the animals'' are in Category 3. Proceduresthat involve ``the inflicting of severe pain or distress or chronic, unrelievedpain or distress, or death'' are in Category 4. Procedures that involveno pain or minor pain are in Category 1 and 2, respectively.Nineteen commenters (16 from the general public and 3 from the researchcommunity) suggested that the Committee review and approve all researchprotocols [ACUPs] instead of only those classified in the third and fourthcategories of pain. One commenter suggested that the Categories of AnimalUse could result in researchers classifying their procedures in Categories1 and 2 to avoid closer scrutiny.We initially proposed Committee review of protocols [ACUPs] involving moresignificant amounts of pain or distress as a means of fulfilling the intentof Congress to minimize animal pain and distress. The Committee would approveof those ACUPs only if they were shown to be justified and scientificallynecessary and if alternatives were considered and determined to be unsatisfactory.Closer scrutiny of procedures falling in Categories 3 and 4 was consideredappropriate to focus attention on these concerns.Upon reconsideration of the utility of the ``Categories of Animal Use''and the difficulty of designing or selecting a practical and appropriatecategorization system, we have decided to adopt the suggestion of thesecommenters and require approval of all ACUPs by the Committee. This practiceis currently required by the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) and thereforeall research facilities receiving grants or awards under the Health ResearchExtension Act of 1985, Pub. L. 99-158, are already doing so. Accordingly,this requirement should not be a burdensome addition to the requirementsalready imposed upon research facilities.For these reasons and as more fully explained below in the discussion ofcomments addressing proposed andSection; 2.35, we are eliminating the ``Categoriesof Animal Use in Research and Teaching'' from the regulations. We understand that the requirement for Committee review and approval ofall ACUPs will impose a greater burden on the Committee's human resourcesand we have therefore provided a mechanism to enable the Committee to accomplishits tasks. As is more fully explained below in the discussion of andSection;2.35, approval by a quorum of the Committee will be required for all ACUPs.However, the Committee can assign individual members to review designatedACUPs and to present them to the Committee for approval or disapproval.In this manner, the Committee should not become overburdened or a bottleneckin the research approval process. We received 596 comments (571 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the requirement in proposed andSection;2.30(d) that the Committee review research protocols [ACUPs] exceeds ourstatutory authority. We received 382 comments (357 from the research communityand 25 from members of the general public) stating that the requirementfor protocol [ACUP] review by the Committee should be deleted. The Actprovides ample authority for requiring Committee review of ``protocols''[ACUPs] and that Committee review is necessary to fulfill the intent ofCongress. Section 13 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143) directs the Secretary to promulgatestandards to govern the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportationof animals by research facilities and other regulated entities. In additionto the requirements for exercise of dogs and for a physical environmentadequate to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates,the Secretary is directed to include requirements for animal care, treatment,and practices in experimental procedures to minimize animal pain and distress;for requiring the principal investigator to consider alternatives to anypainful procedure; for requiring consultation with a doctor of veterinarymedicine; for use of pain relieving drugs; for pre- and post-surgical careby laboratory workers; and for ensuring that no animal is used in morethan one major operative experiment from which it is allowed to recoverexcept in certain circumstances. The Act states that exception to thesestandards may be made ``only when specified by research protocol and thatany such exception shall be detailed and explained in a report outlinedunder paragraph (7) and filed with the Institutional Animal Committee.''(7 U.S.G. 2143(a)(3)(E)). Paragraph (7) of Section 13 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)) directs theSecretary to require each research facility to show upon inspection andthrough reports that it is complying with the Act and that professionallyacceptable standards of care are being followed. In order to do so, eachfacility must provide information on painful procedures used, assurancesthat alternatives were considered, assurances that the facility is adheringto the regulations promulgated under section 13 of the Act, and an explanationfor any deviation from those regulations (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)). The Secretary is directed by the Act to require the establishment of aCommittee at every research facility, in order to assess animal care, treatment,and practices (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)). The Committee is statutorily directedto:<ITAG tagnum="21">Inspect at least semiannually all animal study areas and animal facilitiesof such research facility and review as part of the inspection_(A) practicesinvolving pain to animals, and (B) the condition of animals to ensure compliancewith the provisions of [the] Act to minimize pain and distress to animals.(7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(3)).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Committee is also directed to file an inspection certificationreport which includes:<ITAG tagnum="21">Reports of any violation of the standards promulgated, or assurancesrequired, by the Secretary, including any deficient conditions of animalcare or treatment, any deviations of research practices from originallyapproved proposals that adversely affect animal welfare, any notificationto the facility regarding such conditions, and any corrections made thereafter;* * * (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(4)).</ITAG>In order for research facilities to provide the assurances required, theymust be cognizant of all procedures at the facility involving animals andthey must make a determination that the procedures are in compliance withthe Act and the regulations. This can best be accomplished through theCommittee. Research facilities will necessarily rely upon Committee inspectionreports in order for them to provide the assurances required in their annualreport in good faith. The responsible institutional official with authorityto bind the facility will need to rely upon the Committee's reports incertifying compliance with the Act and the regulations, as required inandSection; 2.31 of the final rule. Without this mechanism, the assurancesand certifications might be successfully challenged as not based on actualknowledge. We have determined that it is necessary that the Committee review all ACUPs,referred to as ``research protocols'' in our proposed regulations, in orderto fulfill the intent of the Act and to effectuate the express purposesof the Act. We received 120 comments stating that review of protocols [ACUPs] shouldbe limited to conform with the U.S. Public Health Service policy whichrequires Committee review of only those components of research protocolsrelated to animal care and use. We believe that much of the resistanceto the proposed requirement that the Committee review ``research protocols''arises out of a misconception that the Committee would be involved in evaluatingthe design, outlines, guidelines, and scientific merit of proposed research.As stated in the supplementary information accompanying the revised rulefor Part 1_``Definition of Terms,'' published elsewhere in this issue (<T3>see </T3>companion docket no. 88-013), this is not the case. The Committeewill be involved with reviewing how the research will treat or affect ananimal, the condition of an animal, and the circumstances under which ananimal will be maintained. It will not be involved in evaluating the design,outlines, guidelines, and scientific merit of proposed research. The requirementthat the Committee review what is now termed the ACUP remains in this revisedrule as proposed, except that the Committee will review all ACUPs, andnot just those involving significant or severe degrees of pain or distress.Two commenters (1 from the general public and 1 from the research community)wanted Committee meetings and ACUP review to be open to the public. Thereis nothing in the Act which either requires or prohibits conducting Committeebusiness in public. Local sunshine laws may require state agencies to conductopen meetings. Otherwise, the decision whether to do so is left to theresearch facilities. It will not be addressed in the regulations. In considering the provisions of proposed andSection; 2.30(d), 2 commentersstated that regulations should be formulated to protect research facilities'trade secrets. The 1985 amendments to the Act added section 27, which declaresit unlawful for any member of a Committee to release any confidential informationof the research facility, including any which concerns or relates to tradesecrets (7 U.S.C. 2157). Section 27 also specifies the punishment for aviolation and clearly provides that any injured person has a private causeof action. It is our belief that this statute and other laws regardingtrade secrets provide sufficient protection and that the promulgation ofregulations is not needed. Two commenters stated that, under proposed andSection; 2.30(d), the Committeeshould review and approve not just painful procedures, but also the speciesof animals to be used for proposed research, the number to be used, thetype of housing to be used, any experimental methods to be employed, andthe training of investigators. As stated above, we proposed the requirementfor review of the procedures classified in Categories 3 and 4 because thestated intent of Congress in amending the Act was to minimize animal painand distress, multiple major surgeries, and unnecessary duplication ofanimal research. The Committee is required and authorized to assess animalcare, treatment, and practices in experimental research. There is no indicationin the Act or in the the legislative history of the Act that Congress intendedthe Committee to consider the species and number of animals used, the housingto be used, experimental methods, or training of investigators, other thanas they affect animal care, treatment, and procedures. Requirements fortraining are imposed by the Act upon the facilities (7 U.S.C. 2143(d)).All exceptions to the regulations and standards must be explained and justifiedby the ACUP and approved by the Committee. Accordingly, we do not agreethat additional reference to Committee review of these areas is needed.Except for the change explained above to require review of all ACUPs bythe Committee, andSection; 2.30(d) remains in the revised rule as originallyproposed. <T3>Section 2.30(e). </T3>As described above, areas of responsibility havebeen reassigned from the Committee to the research facility and accordinglyare added to andSection; 2.30. Comments concerning the substance of thoseprovisions will now be addressed in the order in which they appear in therevised rule, beginning with andSection; 2.30(e). We will discuss the materialunder subject headings. The section designations used in the proposed rulehave been changed and are not used. However, we have included the formersection designations as they appeared in the proposed rule so that thereader can cross-reference the proposal. <T3>Painful procedures . </T3>In enacting the 1985 amendments to the Act,Congress was particularly and expressly concerned with minimizing animalpain and distress. Toward this end, proposed andSection; 2.30(e) would requireresearch facilities to establish a written policy applicable to any practicewhich may be painful to an animal. The policy must require various measuresto be taken when painful procedures are performed and must be designedto ensure that these measures are adequately followed. Proposed andSection;2.35 contains similar requirements although it places the responsibilityfor ensuring compliance with those measures on the Committee. As fullyexplained above under the heading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30 and 2.35,'' we are in agreement with the comments which suggestedthat responsibility for these matters belongs to the research facilitiesand not the Committee, and we have revised andSection; 2.30(e) to reflectthis reallocation of responsibility. Section 2.30(e) applies to all painful procedures and to those that mightreasonably be expected to be painful. The use of pain relieving drugs,anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizers does not mean that a procedureis not painful. This section applies to all procedures that involve painor that might be expected to involve pain, whether or not the pain is relieved.Each paragraph of andSection; 2.30(e) is discussed individually below innumbered sections because the section is rather lengthy. Each discussionbegins with the requirement of the revised rule and then explains its derivationfrom the proposal. Comments concerning the different provisions are thenaddressed. We believe this approach will assist the reader in understandingthe requirements and rationale of this revised rule. 1. Section 2.30(e)(1) of the revised rule directs the research facilityto require written assurance from the principal investigator to the Committeethat alternative procedures were considered but were not suitable, andthat the experiment does not unnecesssarily duplicate previous experiments.The assurance must be given before a painful procedure can be undertaken.The assurance must also indicate what information sources were consulted,what alternative procedures were considered, and what techniques are plannedto minimize pain and discomfort to the animals. This requirement was originallyimposed upon the Committee in proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(v) and on theresearch facility in proposed andSection; 2.30(d). We received a number of comments concerning this assurance. We received402 comments (377 from the research community and 25 from members of thegeneral public) objecting to the assurance required of the principal investigatoras either duplicative or not authorized by the statute. We have, by reorganizingandSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35, eliminated duplicative assurances. Inthe revised rule, the assurance is only required of the research facility.The assurance is not only authorized by the statute, but is in fact mandatedby it. Section 13(a)(3)(B) of the Act requires that the principal investigatorconsider alternatives to painful procedures and section 13(a)(7)(B)(i)of the Act requires research facilities to provide an assurance demonstratingthat this has been done (7 U S.C. 2143(a)). The assurance is thereforenecessary to enable the research facility to comply with the Act.We received 138 comments (136 from members of the general public and 2from the research community) expressing their belief that there is a needfor greater proof that alternative methods were sought or considered andthat the experiment is not unnecessarily duplicative. One member of thegeneral public commented that the requirement for an assurance that a painfulprocedure is not unnecessarily duplicative needs clarification. Our consultation with HHS included consideration of this provision. Representativesfrom HHS were concerned that the phrase ``unnecessarily duplicat[ive]''could be misconstrued. They pointed out that intentional replication ofresearch is often an essential component of research, either for validationof the findings of others or to establish an in-house model of researchthat was developed elsewhere. They also pointed out that section 13(e)of the Act requires the Secretary to establish an information service atthe National Agricultural Library to provide information which ``couldprevent unintended duplication of animal experimentation * * *'' (7 U.S.C.2143(e)). Section 1(b)(3) of the Act, however, includes a finding of theCongress that ``measures which eliminate or minimize the unnecessary duplicationof experiments on animals can result in more productive use of Federalfunds; * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2131(b)(3)). Deliberate duplication of researchcan be deemed necessary if approved by the Committee. We do not agree thatadditional clarification of the regulation is needed. Eight commenters suggested rewording the assurance required in proposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(v)(B) from ``[T]he assurance is to indicate what informationsources were consulted, * * *'' to ``[t]he assurance is to indicate tothe satisfaction of the Committee * * *.'' For the following reasons, wedo not agree that this change is necessary. The requirements of andSection;2.30, including the requirement that the Committee approve the ACUP, mustbe satisfied before a painful procedure can commence. Sections 2.30(d)and (e) of the final rule require the principal investigator to providea written statement to the Committee stating that alternative procedureswere considered and that the procedure is not unnecessarily duplicative,as part of the Committee's ACUP review and approval process. The ACUP wouldnot be approved by the Committee unless it is satisfied with the assurance.Moreover, it is the responsibility of the research facility to requirethis assurance and they in turn must certify that they have in fact doneso as part of their annual report. These provisions taken together shouldbe sufficient to prevent unnecessary duplication of research. 2. Section 2.30(e)(2) of the revised rule provides that the research facilitymust require the principal investigator to consult with the attending veterinarianin the planning of a painful procedure, and that the principal investigatormust consult with the attending veterinarian during the procedure undercertain circumstances. The attending veterinarian must be allowed to observethe procedure at any time to ensure compliance with the regulations. Inproposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(A), the Committee was directed to requirethe principal investigator to consult with the attending veterinarian.In proposed andSection; 2.30(e)(1) the research facility was required toestablish a written policy ensuring that this consultation is conducted.We received 148 comments stating that the phrase ``and during the procedure''should be deleted from proposed andSection; 2.30(e)(1). The commenters expressedconcern that consultation during the conduct of an approved procedure wouldbe prohibitively costly and would place the attending veterinarian in theposition of policing the institution for compliance with the Animal Welfareregulations. We had intended that the attending veterinarian must be readilyavailable during the course of a painful procedure to consult in the eventof special, unanticipated, or unusual situations, and have therefore rephrasedthe requirement in the revised rule to make clear our intent. We also believethat the attending veterinarian should be allowed to make random checksof procedures to assure that the regulations and standards are being followed.We have found that on occasion the attending veterinarian has become awareof a noncompliance situation in a classroom or laboratory and has beenprevented from remedying it. We have also learned of instances where theattending veterinarian has been prevented from entering an animal areaonce a procedure has begun. To ensure that these situations do not occur,and that the attending veterinarian is not obstructed in performing hisor her duties, the attending veterinarian must have the authority to conductrandom oversight inspections of procedures in progress. We have clarifiedandSection; 2.30(e)(2) in the revised rule to reflect that the attendingveterinarian must be available for consultation during a painful procedureas well as during ACUP planning and development. It also requires thatthe research facility ensure that the attending veterinarian is allowedaccess to all animal and research areas to observe the procedure at anytime during the course of the procedure, in order to fulfill the requirementsof paragraph (e)(2). 3. Section 2.30(e)(3) of the revised rule requires research facilitiesto require the use of pain relieving drugs, anesthetics, analgesics, andtranquilizers to minimize pain unless they are withheld in accordance withthe provisions of andSection; 2.30(e)(4), and that they be administered inaccordance with the directions and recommendations of the attending veterinarianand in accordance with the accepted or established use of the drugs. ProposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iv) would have required the Committee to ensure thatpain relieving drugs are used in any painful procedure unless an exemptionis approved by the Committee and the attending veterinarian. Proposed andSection;2.30(e)(2) would have required the research facility to establish a writtenpolicy ensuring the proper use of pain relieving drugs. For the reasonsstated above under the heading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30 and 2.35,'' in this revised rule the research facility, not the Committee,is responsible for requiring that pain relieving drugs are used unlesswithholding them is scientifically necessary, fully explained and justifiedin the ACUP, and approved by the attending veterinarian and the Committee,in accordance with andSection; 2.30(e)(4). One commenter objected in general to the requirement that pain relievingdrugs be used in any procedure that would reasonably be expected to causepain or distress in a human subject. The commenter stated that this isnot always consistent with current veterinary practice. We believe thatthe exemption provision in andSection; 2.30(e)(4) adequately addresses thoseinstances when use of pain relieving drugs is not consistent with currentveterinary practice, and that the presumption should remain in favor ofproviding pain relieving drugs, in order to carry out the purposes of the1985 amendments to the Act. 4. Section 2.30(e)(4) of the revised rule provides that research facilitiesmust require that pain relieving drugs, anesthetics, analgesics, and tranquilizersbe reduced in amount or withheld only if scientifically necesssary, fullyexplained in the ACUP, and approved by the attending veterinarian and theCommittee. The drugs can then be reduced in amount or withheld only foras long as necessary, as specified in the ACUP. Proposed andSection; 2.30(e)(2)would require each research facility to establish a written policy providingfor the proper use of pain relieving drugs. Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iv)would place responsibility for ensuring the proper use of pain relievingdrugs on the Committee and would provide that pain relieving drugs couldonly be minimized or withheld if fully explained and justified in the researchprotocol [ACUP] and agreed to by the Committee and the attending veterinarian.Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(F) would place specific responsibilityon the Committee for prohibiting the withholding of pain relieving drugsexcept when scientifically necessary and approved by the Committee andthe attending veterinarian. We received 138 comments (136 from members of the general public and 2from the research community) stating that stronger regulations requiringpain relieving drug use are necessary. We disagree that stronger regulationsare needed. Responsibility for requiring proper use of pain relieving drugsis placed on the research facility in this revised rule in response tothe comments suggesting that the facility and not the Committee is ultimatelyresponsible for this assurance. The responsible institutional officialwill be required to certify in the annual report that the research facilityhas complied with the regulations concerning use of pain relieving drugs.Accordingly, we believe that additional regulations are not necessary.One commenter objected to the authority given to the attending veterinarianto overrule in effect the Committee's decision with regard to the grantor denial of an exemption from the requirement to use pain relieving drugs,since the Act only requires consultation. The Act requires that pain anddistress be minimized or eliminated. We believe that the attending veterinarian,by virtue of his or her training, duties, and responsibility, is qualifiedto make this assessment on behalf of the animals. It is the responsibilityof the principal investigator to convince the Committee and the attendingveterinarian that scientific necessity justifies withholding drugs. Ifthe Committee is convinced of the scientific necessity, it too can attemptto convince the attending veterinarian. We believe that full concurrenceby the Committee and the attending veterinarian is necessary in this area,due to the stated intent of Congress. 5. Section 2.30(e)(5) of the final rule directs research facilities torequire that the attending veterinarian provide training of laboratorypersonnel in the proper use of pain relieving drugs so as to minimize painand distress to animals. Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(B) would haverequired the Committee to require that the principal investigator providefor the proper use of pain relieving drugs in accordance with establishedor accepted veterinary procedures, and provide for training of laboratorypersonnel to carry out those procedures. We did not receive any commentsaddressing the substance of the requirement as proposed. However, as partof the reassignment of responsibilities and the reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30 and 2.35, responsibility for training of laboratory personnel in thoseprocedures is placed on the research facility in the revised rule.We also believe that the attending veterinarian is in the best positionand is most qualified to provide training of laboratory personnel in theproper use of pain relieving drugs because of his or her expertise in medicineand in established or accepted veterinary procedures. Accordingly, whileresearch facilities are ultimately responsible for ensuring that this trainingis provided, we believe that it is most appropriately carried out throughthe attending veterinarian.6. Section 2.30(e)(6) of the revised rule directs research facilities torequire that all pre-procedural, procedural, and post-procedural care beprovided by laboratory workers or surgical personnel, in accordance withthe attending veterinarian's instructions and established veterinary medicaland nursing procedures. It also directs research facilities to requirethat this care and the qualifications of those personnel be evaluated andapproved by the attending veterinarian. Proposed andSection; 2.30(e)(3) wouldhave required each research facility to establish a written policy ensuringall pre-surgical, surgical, and post-surgical care by laboratory workersis in accordance with established veterinary medical and nursing procedures,and ensuring that the care, surgical rooms, and qualifications of surgicalpersonnel have been evaluated and approved by the attending veterinarian.Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(C) would have required the Committeeto require that pre-surgical and post-surgical care be provided by laboratoryworkers, in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarianand established veterinary medical and nursing procedures. In the revisedrule, this responsibility is placed on the research facility because, asdiscussed under the heading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30and 2.35,'' the facility is ultimately responsible for proper care.Also, because the facility is responsible for the acts of its employees,it is ultimately responsible for ensuring their qualifications. Evaluationof the qualifications of personnel is carried out through the attendingveterinarian because he or she is most qualified to evaluate those qualifications.In the revised rule, the requirements imposed on the research facilitiesencompass pre-procedural, procedural, and post-procedural care, and arenot limited to surgical procedures. This revision is necessary becausepainful procedures, as defined in the revised rule for Part 1 (<T3>see</T3> companion docket no. 88-013), published elsewhere in thisissue, include any procedure that would reasonably be expected to causemore than slight or momentary pain or distress in a human being to whichthat procedure was applied. Therefore, practices or procedures that mightreasonably be expected to be painful procedures, are not limited to surgicalprocedures. The Act directs the Secretary to promulgate requirements ``foranimal care, treatment, and practices in experimental procedures to ensurethat animal pain and distress are minimized, including adequate veterinarycare * * * '' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(A)). All procedures must be coveredby the required program of adequate veterinary care in accordance withthe Act. Accordingly, it is necessary to direct that research facilitiesrequire that personnel rendering pre-procedural, procedural, and post-proceduralcare perform in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian,and that the care and the qualifications of personnel be evaluated andapproved by the attending veterinarian, in order to ensure adequate veterinarycare and to effectuate the mandate of the Act.Six commenters stated that the word ``veterinary'' preceding ``medicaland nursing procedures'' should be deleted from proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(C).We believe that it is more precise to specify veterinary medical and nursingprocedures when we are referring to care and procedures involving animals.Therefore, the word ``veterinary'' is retained in andSection; 2.30(e)(6)in the revised rule.7. Section 2.30(e)(7) of the revised rule provides that research facilitiesmust require that all survival surgeries be conducted only in facilitiesintended for that purpose, that they be operated and maintained under asepticconditions, and that surgical rooms be evaluated and approved by the attendingveterinarian. Proposed andSection; 2.30(e)(3) would have required each researchfacility to establish a written policy ensuring, among other things, thatsurgical rooms be evaluated and approved by the attending veterinarian.Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(D) would have required the Committeeto require that all aseptic survival surgeries be conducted in facilitiesintended for that purpose, that such facilities be operated and maintainedunder aseptic conditions, and that any surgery be performed or directlysupervised by trained, experienced personnel. This responsibility has beenplaced on the research facility in the revised rule since the facilityis ultimately responsible for the proper conduct of surgeries. We received 12 comments suggesting that we restrict the requirements for``all aseptic survival surgeries'' to non-rodent species. The regulationsdo not apply to laboratory bred rats and mice and therefore no such restrictionis necessary.We also received 387 comments (362 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) objecting to the requirement that all asepticsurvival surgeries be conducted in facilities intended for that purposeas too restrictive. One commenter suggested that we distinguish betweenmajor and minor surgical procedures. We disagree with these comments. Thesuggested major/minor distinction would likely lead to disputes over whatshould be considered major and what minor. By its terms, the requirementsprovided in andSection; 2.30(e) are limited to painful procedures. We believethat this is the appropriate distinction upon which to base the requirementscontained in paragraph (e)(7). We are therefore retaining the requirementsstated above for all survival surgeries which are painful procedures.8. Section 2.30(e)(8) of the revised rule provides that research facilitiesmust require that any surgery be performed or directly supervised by trained,experienced personnel. Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(D) would haverequired the Committee to require that all aseptic survival surgeries beperformed or directly supervised by trained, experienced personnel. Forthe reasons provided under the heading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30 and 2.35,'' and because responsibility for the proper conduct of surgicalprocedures ultimately belongs to the facility, this responsibility is placedon the research facility in the revised rule. 9. Section 2.30(e)(9) of the revised rule requires research facilitiesto prohibit the use of paralytic drugs without anesthesia. Proposed andSection;2.30(e)(4) would require each research facility to establish a writtenpolicy prohibiting the use of paralytic drugs without anesthesia and proposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vi)(E) would require the Committee to do so as well.For the reasons provided under the heading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30 and 2.35,'' this responsibility is placed on the research facilityin the revised rule, since it is ultimately responsible for rendering propercare.Thirty-one commenters stated that ``paralytic drug'' should be definedin the regulations. We agree and are including a definition of ``paralyticdrug'' in revised Part 1_``Definition of Terms,'' published elsewhere inthis issue of the <T4>Federal Register </T4> (<T3>See </T3>companion docket no. 88-013.)One commenter suggested strengthening the proposed regulations by statingthe level of surgical anesthesia that should be required in order to usea paralytic drug. We believe that this is a matter that should be leftto the research facility's program for providing adequate veterinary care.Also, consultation with the attending veterinarian should include matterssuch as the proper level of surgical anesthesia.10. Section 2.30(e)(10) of the revised rule requires research facilitiesto establish a written policy to ensure compliance with the provisionsof andSection;andSection; 2.30(e) (1) though (9). Proposed andSection; 2.30(e)would have required research facilities to establish a written policy limitedto ensuring the various aspects of veterinary care and procedures providedin proposed andSection; 2.30(e). Due to the reassignment of responsibilitiesin Subpart C, the written policy must be extended to cover additional areasof animal care and treatment. For this reason, the requirement to establisha written policy is revised to cover the provisions of paragraphs (e) (1)through (9). We received 123 comments stating that establishing a written policy forthe veterinary consultation required by proposed andSection; 2.30(e)(1) (andSection;2.30(e)(2) in the revised rule) is unnecessary. Since facilities are responsiblefor requiring this consultation and for maintaining a program of adequateveterinary care, and must certify that the required care is being providedin accordance with the Animal Welfare regulations and standards, it isnecessary that each research facility have a written policy so that therules all personnel must follow are clear. The written policy must be providedto all principal investigators so that they can comply with its provisions.Distribution of the policy will ensure that all personnel have knowledgeof the required consultations and procedures for minimizing and reducinganimal pain, and can be held responsible by facilities for compliance withit. A written policy will also reduce any confusion over what is requiredbefore a painful procedure can be performed, and will standardize procedureswithin a research facility. Without a written policy the research facilitywould not be able to adequately monitor compliance by its personnel andcould not assure that the requirements of the law were being followed.We have retained the requirement that a written policy be established requiringveterinary consultation and the other provisions of andSection; 2.30(e) inthis revised rule.<T3>Section 2.30(f) Multiple major operative experiments.</T3> Section2.30(f)(1) of the revised rule states that research facilities using orholding animals for research, testing, or teaching must establish and followwritten procedures which assure that no animal is used in more than onemajor operative experiment from which it is allowed to recover except underthe circumstances provided in the regulation. Proposed andSection; 2.30(f)would have required research facilities to establish procedures which assurethat no animal is used in more than one major operative experiment fromwhich it is allowed to recover except as provided in proposed andSection;2.35. Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vii) would have required the Committeeto assure that no animal is so used except in certain circumstances providedin proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(vii) (A) through (G) of the section. Becausethe research facility is ultimately responsible for assuring the properuse of animals, the requirements to assure that no animal is used in morethan one major operative experiment from which it is allowed to recoverexcept in certain circumstances and to establish procedures which assurethis are placed on the facility. We are requiring, in this revised rule,that the procedures be in writing so that all personnel will have knowledgeof them. We received 39 comments objecting to the limitation on major operativeexperiments using the same animal. The commenters stated that this wouldinterfere with research involving extensive behavior training or otherresearch. We understand that this requirement may interfere with some research whichinvolves animals used in multiple surgeries which are unrelated, or whichare not part of the same procedure, or which do not fall under any of theexceptions provided in the regulations. This is precisely what the Actintended. Section 13(a)(2)(D) of the Act requires the Secretary to promulgatestandards including requirements that ``no animal is used in more thanone major operative experiment from which it is allowed to recover exceptin cases of_(i) scientific necessity; or (ii) other special circumstancesas determined by the Secretary; * * *'' (7 U.S.C. andSection; 2143(a)(2)(D)).The regulations prevent multiple use of animals only when there is no scientificnecessity or other special circumstances justifying it. The regulationsinclude a mechanism for obtaining permission from the Secretary if specialcircumstances exist which are not included in the regulations. We believethat this regulation will not interfere with the justified use of an animalin multiple surgeries. Four commenters from the general public stated that the regulation providestoo many exceptions from the prohibition against multiple surgeries, andthat the exceptions are too broad. One commenter stated that the terms``major operative experiment'' and ``scientific necessity'' should be definedand that the exceptions should not apply to animals used in teaching anddemonstration exercises. We believe that the exceptions provided in theregulation are all necessary exceptions to the prohibition of the Act.We also believe the exceptions are stated narrowly. The exception for scientificnecessity requires approval by the Com-mittee and is not subject to unilateralinterpretation by the investigator. The Committee is the appropriate bodyto evaluate whether or not a proposed procedure is scientifically necessary,and we do not believe it is necessary to define this term. The term ``majoroperative experiment'' is defined in Part 1_``Definition of Terms.'' (<T3>See</T3> companion docket no. 88-013, published elsewhere in this issue.)Whether exceptions should be made for animals used in research, testing,teaching and demonstration exercises is left to the research facilities,however the exceptions granted must still fall within one of the circumstancesprovided in the regulation in order to use an animal in multiple majoroperative experiments. No changes have been made based upon this comment.<T3>Section 2.30(g) Exceptions.</T3> Section 2.30(g) of the revised ruleprovides the limited circumstances under which exceptions to the AnimalWelfare standards and regulations can be made. It also provides the reportingprocedure which must be followed if an exception is made by a researchfacility. Responsibility for granting exceptions is placed on the research facilityin the revised rule, since it is the research facility's responsibilityunder the Act to certify compliance with the standards and regulationsand to explain any deviation from the standards (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)(B)).The Committee must first approve the ACUP since its duty is to assess animalcare, treatment, and practices, and since the Act requires that any exceptionsto the standards be made only when specified by research protocol and whendetailed and explained in a report filed with the Committee (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(E)).The research facility can grant exceptions to the standards and regulationsonly when necessary for the accomplishment of the research design, andonly if the exception: (1) Is specified in the ACUP; (2) is explained indetail; and (3) is approved by the Committee. The principal investigatormust file a report with the Committee before it reviews the ACUP, detailingthe areas of noncompliance. The facility must keep a copy of the reporton file and make it available to APHIS inspectors and officials of fundingFederal agencies. The facility must attach a copy of all reports detailingand explaining exceptions to compliance to its annual report. As revised, andSection; 2.30(g) consolidates the provisions of proposedandSection;andSection; 2.30(g) and 2.35(c). Proposed andSection; 2.30(g) wouldhave allowed exceptions to the requirements of proposed andSection; 2.30(e) and (f) (animal care assurances and procedures assuring against multipleuse of animals in major operative experiments, respectively) to be madeonly when specified by the ``research protocol'' [ACUP] and approved bythe Committee. The principal investigator would be required to detail andexplain the exception in a written report to be filed with the Committeeand attached to the facility's annual report to the Department. It wouldalso provide for withholding of pain relieving drugs when scientificallynecessary. (This provision has been included in andSection; 2.30(s)(4) ofthe revised rule.) Proposed andSection; 2.35(c) would have allowed the Committeeto grant exceptions only when necessary for the accomplishment of the researchdesign, specified in the ``research protocol'' [ACUP], and explained indetail. The principal investigator would be required to file a report withthe Committee explaining the exception in detail. A copy of the reportwould be required to be kept on file by the facility and to be availablefor inspection by USDA inspectors or officials of granting agencies. Under the revised rule, only the Committee is authorized to approve exceptionsto compliance with the regulations and standards, however it is made clearthat the research facility is ultimately responsible for any exceptionsgranted. We received 33 comments objecting to the proposed requirement that theprincipal investigator first file a written report, and suggesting thatan oral report to the Committee is sufficient. We cannot make any changesbased upon this comment since the Act specifically requires that exceptionsto the standards be detailed and explained in a report and filed with theCommittee (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(E)). The Act also requires a written explanationfrom research facilities for any deviation from the standards. Becauseof these specific requirements in the Act, we do not have the authorityto require only an oral report instead of a written report.Six commenters stated that the procedure provided in proposed andSection;2.30(g) for approval of exceptions to the requirements of proposed andSection;2.30 (e) and (f) should also be available for exceptions from other requirementsin the regulations. We believe that the revised rule is broad enough tocover exceptions from any of the Animal Welfare regulations and will allaythe commenters concerns that exceptions to regulations other than andSection;2.30 (e) and (f) be possible. <T3>Section 2.30(h) Exercise for dogs and psychological well-being of primates.</T3>As stated in the discussion of the reassignment of responsibilitiesfrom the Committee to the research facility under the heading, ``Reorganizationof andSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35,'' the research facility is responsiblein this revised rule for establishing written procedures and systems forthe exercise of dogs and for the psychological well-being of primates inaccordance with the regulations and standards, and for establishing a recordsystem indicating that such a procedure or system is being carried out.This must be done in consultation with the attending veterinarian. (Theseprocedures may be included in the facility's standard operating procedure,although this is not mandatory.) The proposed standards for exercise ofdogs and to promote the psychological well-being of nonhuman primates areprovided in a related document published elsewhere in this issue. (<T3>See </T3>companion docket no. 87-004.) We received 357 comments (332 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the requirement for establishing theseprocedures and systems should be implemented by the attending veterinarian,rather than the Committee as originally proposed, to avoid conflicts betweenthe attending veterinarian and the other Committee members. The reassignmentof responsibility for these procedures to the research  facility removesthe possibility of conflict between the Committee and the attending veterinarian.The Committee will still be responsible for inspecting animal areas toensure that pain and distress are minimized and it is also required toapprove of any ACUPs which deviate from the standards of Part 3. Thesefunctions should not conflict with the attending veterinarian's consultativerole in developing written procedures and systems. No change is made asa result of these comments. We received 505 comments (480 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to the requirement for a separate recordsystem to document that these procedures are being carried out. The requirementsfor exercise of dogs and for promoting the psychological well-being ofnonhuman primates are two of the primary directives of the 1985 amendmentsto the Act. We believe that a separate record system provides a vital mechanismto ensure compliance with the regulations and to give our inspectors ameans of checking for compliance. This is particularly so with regard toexercise for dogs and promoting the psychological well-being of nonhumanprimates. Unlike tangible requirements, such as cage sizes and cleanlinesswhich can be observed at all times, there must be written verificationthat the procedures concerning exercise for dogs and psychological well-beingof nonhuman primates are being followed in order to ensure compliance.We believe that the required recordkeeping is reasonable and will ensurecompliance. No change is made in the regulations based upon this comment.<T3>Section 2.30(i) Training. </T3>The requirement to provide for the trainingand continuing education of personnel was imposed upon the research facilitiesin the proposed rule. However, the task of reviewing the status of thetraining and the qualifications of researchers, and of designating thosepersonnel needing additional training was imposed on the Committee in proposedandSection; 2.35(f). This requirement is also imposed on research facilitiesin andSection; 2.30(i) of the revised rule, because the Act makes the facilitiesresponsible for training (7 U.S.C. 2143(d)). We have determined, however,that this responsibility should be carried out through the attending veterinarian,since the training will be in areas in which the attending veterinarianhas expertise, such as proper drug usage and pre- and post-procedural care.(The proposed rule would require training in proper pre-surgical and post-surgicalcare of animals. For the reasons set forth in our discussion of andSection;2.30(e)(6) under the subheading, ``Painful procedures,'' this requirementapplies to all procedures in order to ensure adequate veterinary care,and is not limited to surgical procedures.) Nineteen commenters stated that the proposed training requirements arebeyond the scope of the Act. We have considered this comment, but are makingno changes based upon it. The training requirements are either specificallystated in the Act or are necessary adjuncts of the areas of animal carein which instruction is required by the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(d)). For example,the requirement in andSection; 2.30(i)(4)(ix) to provide training in theproper use of pain relieving drugs is a necessary adjunct of ``includ[ing]instruction on research or testing methods that minimize or eliminate theuse of animals or limit animal pain or distress; * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(d)(2)).We are making some changes in the requirements for annual review of thestatus and qualifications of personnel who use animals, because other institutionalmechanisms exist for discovering deficiencies in the level of trainingand qualification. We have also eliminated the requirement for trainingin the area of animal ethics. These modifications are discussed below inthis section.Two commenters noted their support for the proposed training requirementsand suggested more stringent training requirements. We believe the trainingrequirements contained in andSection; 2.30(i) are within the scope of theAct and satisfy the intent of the Act. If, after the regulations are ineffect, it appears that more stringent regulations are necessary, we willconsider proposing additional or revised regulations.Seventy-nine commenters suggested that training should be made availableto individuals based upon the species of animal they use or some otherspecific need. Proposed andSection; 2.35(f)(2) would have required that thetraining ``be made available annually or as appropriate to the individualsand their responsibilities'' and a similar provision is maintained in thisrevised rule. We are concerned that the proposed language could be misconstruedas requiring that only the frequency and not the substance of trainingbe appropriate to the individuals and their responsibilities. Section 2.30(i)(2)is clarified in the revised rule to reflect that both the substance ofthe training must be appropriate to the individuals and their responsibilities,as well as the frequency of the training that is made available to them.Under the rule, the research facilities can determine whether trainingshould be based upon the species of animal used, or whether other criteriashould be used, in accordance with their determination of what is appropriate,so long as the areas listed in andSection; 2.30(i)(4) are covered. We received 560 comments (535 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to the requirement of proposed andSection;2.35(f)(3) that the Committee annually review the status of training andqualifications of researchers who use animals. The commenters stated thatthis would be costly and impractical. Although responsibility for thisreview is placed on the research facility in this revised rule, we anticipatethat the same objection will be raised, as the facility must bear the costof the review. Representatives of HHS have pointed out that internal mechanismsexist in research facilities, such as performance appraisals, which wouldhighlight the need for additional training, and that facilities shouldbe afforded an opportunity to satisfy the requirements of the Act by developingmonitoring procedures which utilize these existing mechanisms. We agreethat some facilities may have adequate means of reviewing the status oftraining and the qualifications of personnel, and we are revising the requirementfor annual review at research facilities. Research facilities could avoida separate annual review as required by andSection; 2.30(i)(3) in the revisedrule, if they have a written policy requiring that they annually reviewtheir personnel in the areas of training and qualifications. We received 434 comments (409 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) suggesting that the areas of instruction requiredin paragraph (4) be listed in two groups: one for all employees and onefor employees involved with animal care, use, and treatment. By its terms,the training required by andSection; 2.30(i) in the revised rule is limitedto those persons involved with animal use, care, and treatment. Those personswho do not have this contact with animals would not be required to undergothe requisite training. Accordingly there is no need to divide the areasidentified in andSection; 2.30(i)(4) into two parts as the commenters suggested.Training of personnel who are not involved with animal care, use, and treatmentis left to the determination of the research facilities, because it isbeyond the scope of the Act. Proposed andSection; 2.35(f)(4)(i) would require instruction in ``[h]umanemethods of animal maintenance and experimentation and animal ethics; ** *.'' Eight commenters suggested that the requirement for instructionin animal ethics be deleted and another 37 commenters suggested substituting``research ethics'' for ``animal ethics.'' We agree that the term ``animalethics'' invites differing philosophical views over what the substanceand content of the instruction should be, making regulation difficult.Therefore, we are deleting the reference to ``animal ethics.'' The remainingrequired areas of instruction fulfill the intent of the Act. We received 299 comments (274 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to paragraph (4)(xi) of proposed andSection;2.35(f). As proposed, it would have required instruction in ``[o]ther training,techniques, or procedures the Committee, or the Secretary, may feel isnecessary.'' Responsibility for this determination is reassigned to theresearch facility as part of the reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30and 2.35. The commenters stated that paragraph (xi) is meaningless forcompliance purposes and should be deleted. We disagree. The Secretary musthave the flexibility to require training in additional areas if it is determinedto be necessary. Also, as scientific knowledge evolves, it could becomeapparent that additional or different training in new technologies is needed,and the Secretary must have the authority under the regulations to requirethis training in order to fulfill the intent of the Act. Except for those changes discussed above, the substance of proposed andSection;2.35(f) remains as originally proposed. However, responsibility for compliancewith the requirement to provide training is placed on the research facilityin andSection; 2.30(i) of the revised rule. <T3>Section 2.30(j) Reporting. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(iii)would require the Committee to establish a reporting procedure for personnelor employees to report violations of the Animal Welfare regulations, includingproblems, deviations, or deficiencies with animal housing, care, or use.The Committee would review and investigate reports of violations and wouldthen prepare and file a report at a central location. It would also protectCommittee members and personnel from discrimination or reprisal for reportingviolations. The Act requires that the Committee file an inspection certificationreport, including reports of any violations or deficient conditions ofanimal care or treatment, any deviations of research practices from originallyapproved proposals that adversely affect animal welfare, any notificationto the facility regarding such conditions, and any corrections made (7U.S.C. 2143(b)(4)(A)). The Act does not specifically mandate that the Committeedevise a reporting procedure for personnel to report violations. Accordingly,this responsibility is reassigned to the research facilities in andSection;2.30(j) of the revised rule. The Committee, however, is still requiredto review and investigate reports, under the revised rule. The Committeeis in the best position to do so because it is established to assess animalcare and use, and has inspection authority under the Act. Research facilitiesare also required to establish the central location for filing reportsunder the revised rule. This requirement is set forth in andSection; 2.30(m).We received 367 comments (342 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the proposal to require a reportingprocedure to report violations or deficiencies to the Committee exceedsthe authority of the Act, as the Act refers to training for these proceduresonly. Section 13(d) of the Act requires each research facility to providetraining including instruction on ``methods whereby deficiencies in animalcare and treatment should be reported.'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(d).) This directivepresumes the establishment of a reporting procedure. The legislative historyof the 1985 amendments to the Act which require this training makes thispoint eminently clear. In the <T3>Congressional Record </T3>of December 18, 1985, at page S17943, SenatorDole stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">[i]t is intended that all personnel be acquainted with the provisionsof this Act and instructed to report deficiencies promptly to ensure thatthe facility is in compliance at all times. No one should be discriminatedagainst for reporting violations of the Act. Veterinary inspectors fromthe U.S. Department of Agriculture cannot be present on a daily basis.However, their enforcement capability can and should be enhanced by theInstitutional Animal Committee and personnel in laboratories must be protectedagainst any reprisal for reporting mistreatment of animals.</ITAG>The Conference Report included in the <T3>Congressional Record </T3>of December 17, 1985 at page H12421 states,``[a]ll personnel are intended to be acquainted with the provisions ofthis Act and instructed to report deficiencies promptly to ensure thatthe institution is in compliance at all times. No employee shall be discriminatedagainst for reporting violations.'' We believe the Act intended that amechanism for reporting violations and deficiencies be implemented at researchfacilities as a vital means of ensuring compliance with the Act and theregulations. The Secretary is authorized to promulgate regulations deemednecessary to effectuate the purposes of the Act, including the reportingof violations and deficiencies. The requirement for a reporting proceduretherefore does not exceed the statutory authority. Two members of the general public and 1 commenter from the research communitystated that the reporting provisions should include protection for theemployer as well as for employees and Committee members. The legislativehistory cited above addresses protection against reprisal or discriminationfor employees who report violations. It is silent on employers and facilitiesthat report personnel as being in violation of the Act or regulations.The Act intends that facility personnel function as checks on each otherand on the facility as a whole, and relies on the facility to monitor itsown house. The facilities have the resources to safeguard themselves andtheir supervisory officials and we do not believe that regulations providingthis protection are warranted.<T3>Section 2.30(k) Federal research facilities. </T3>Proposed andSection;2.35(e) would have required federal research facilities to establish anInstitutional Animal Care and Use Committee (Committee) having the sameduties and functions as nonfederal research facilities except that theCommittee would report deficiencies to the head of the federal agency conductingthe research instead of to APHIS, and the head of the federal agency wouldbe responsible for all corrective action and for granting of all exceptionsto inspection protocol. As stated in the initial paragraphs of the supplementaryinformation to Subpart C, we have determined that it is more appropriateto include this provision in andSection; 2.30 since it is directed to theresearch entity and not the Committee. It is andSection; 2.30(k) in the revisedrule. We received two comments concerning proposed andSection; 2.35(e) ``Federalresearch facilities,'' both from members of the research community. Thecomments stated that ``institutional official responsible for animal careand use'' should be substituted for ``head'' of the federal agency, becauseauthority to administer animal care may be delegated to another officialin the agency. We disagree and have used the language appearing in theAct. The Department is not involved in a determination by an agency ``head''to delegate authority in accordance with agency internal procedure. Wecannot by regulation place this authority at a lower level than that legislatedby Congress. No change is made in the revised rule. <T3>Section 2.30(1) Reviews. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(i) wouldrequire the Committee to make all research protocols [ACUPs] and assurancestatements required by PHS or other funding Federal agencies availablefor review upon the request of the Administrator, to assure compliancewith the Act. Department inspectors would be required to maintain the confidentialityof the requested material. Under the reorganization described above, theresponsibility for responding to a Departmental request ultimately restswith the research facility or responsible institutional official actingon behalf of the research facility, and is included in andSection; 2.30 inthe revised rule as subsection (1). We received 529 comments (504 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to the requirement to make all protocols[ACUPs] and assurance statements available to APHIS. Some of the concernsfocused on public release of the materials. Others were that the requirementexceeds statutory authority. As to the latter concern, the Secretary hasauthority under the Act to require production of all ACUPs and assurancestatements as part of the authority to require each research facility toshow, upon inspection, that the provisions of the Act are being followed(7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)). Section 16 of the Act authorizes the Secretary tomake investigations or inspections as he or she deems necessary to determinewhether any provision of the Act or the regulations and standards havebeen or are being violated (7 U.S.C. 2146(a)). Review of ACUPs and assurancestatements would provide important information and would be key indicatorsas to whether any of the provisions of the Act or regulations are beingviolated or have been violated. We understand the research facilities' concern with public release of thesedocuments, particularly before a violation of the Act or the regulationshas been established. We agree in part with commenters who stated thatthis material should not be retained by USDA and possibly subject to releaseto the public in response to Freedom of Information Act requests to USDA.Section 2.30(1) is revised to reflect that these materials will not beremoved from the research facilities' premises unless there has been analleged violation or the material is needed for an investigation or otherenforcement purposes. Thirty-eight commenters requested clarification as to when the Administratorcould request that ``protocols'' and assurance statements be made availablefor review by the Department. These documents would be requested wheneverthere is reason to believe there may be noncompliance with the Act or theregulations, when needed to investigate possible or alleged violations,and when needed for other enforcement purposes. <T3>Section 2.30(m) Reports. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(iv) wouldrequire that any reports required by proposed andSection; 2.35 be kept onfile at the research facility for at least 3 years and be made availablefor inspection and review by APHIS inspectors and any funding Federal agency.We did not receive any comments addressing this proposed requirement. Wehave revised the requirement in this rule, however, to provide that, uponnotification from the Administrator, research facilities must retain recordsfor more than 3 years pending completion of an investigation or proceeding,as required by andSection; 2.81. This is a nonsubstantive change becauseresearch facilities are subject to the provisions of andSection; 2.81. Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i) would require that the Committee fileits inspection certification report at a central location at the researchfacility. We are including the requirement that research facilities maintaina central location for filing reports. The proposed rule referred to inspection and review of reports by APHISinspectors. We have revised these provisions to provide for inspectionand review of reports by APHIS officials as a result of the change in termsused for APHIS personnel, as described in a related document publishedelsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>docket no. 88-013, Part 1_``Definition of Terms.''The term ``APHIS official'' as defined in Part 1 would include an APHISinspector. The research facility is ultimately responsible for retaining the Committee'sreports and assurance statements. Accordingly, this provision has beenplaced in andSection; 2.30 in the revised rule as paragraph (m). We havealso revised it to refer to any reports required by Part 2, instead ofandSection; 2.35 as originally proposed, due to the reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30 and 2.35. <T3>Section 2.31 Annual report of research facilities. </T3>Proposed andSection;2.28 requires each research facility to submit an annual report to theArea Veterinarian in Charge. This was proposed under Subpart B_``Registration.''We believe it is more appropriate to include this requirement under SubpartC_``Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees and Other Requirementsfor Research Facilities,'' since it applies only to research facilities.Accordingly, it is redesignated as andSection; 2.31 in the revised rule.The comments we received concerning the annual report refer to proposedandSection; 2.28 and we will refer to the proposed section and paragraphdesignations in addressing the substance of those comments. <T3>General. </T3>We received numerous comments addressing the annual reportrequired of research facilities, the information we are requiring to beincluded in the report, and the proposed certifications of the report.We received 443 comments (417 from the research community and 26 from membersof the general public) stating that the proposed regulation exceeds theDepartment's statutory authority. We believe that the annual report andits contents are not only authorized, but are mandated by the Act. Section13(a)(7)(A) of the Act states the Secretary ``shall require each researchfacility to show upon inspection, and to report at least annually, thatthe provisions of this Act are being followed * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)(A)).The Act goes on to specify information that the research facilities mustprovide in their report. We believe that the information we are requiringin the report is either specifically required by the Act or is necessaryto enable the Department to determine if the facility is in compliancewith the Act and the regulations.We also received 168 comments from the research community objecting thatthe information required to be provided on the annual report would involveextensive record-keeping and reporting beyond the requirements of the Act.The assurances and information required of research facilities by andSection;2.28 are required by section 13 of the Act. This information enables theDepartment to inspect for compliance with the regulations and standardsunder the Act, and enables the Secretary to submit the comprehensive anddetailed annual written report to Congress required by section 25 of theAct (7 U.S.C. 2155).We received 456 comments (431 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) requesting that the annual report be revised andsimplified. They also stated that andSection; 2.28 as proposed would requireredundant assurances. We agree that simplification of the report is desirable,and we have modified the report requirements in the revised rule.One commenter from the research community stated that the annual reportshould be revised to include all pertinent information. We are currentlyreviewing the annual report form, Form VS 18-23. The form will be updatedand revised as necessary to include all information that will now be requiredby the regulations.Two commenters from the research community suggested that we incorporatethe registration update required by andSection; 2.25 in the annual report.These two reporting requirements serve very different purposes. We believethat combining them would create problems rather than simplify matters.The registration update is required of all registrants every 3 years sothat the Department can maintain accurate records of the identity and locationof registrants. The annual report is, as its name indicates, a yearly reportrequired only from research facilities. Not all registrants are researchfacilities. If the two different reporting requirements were combined forthe research facilities, yet another reporting system would have to bedevised for those registrants who are not research facilities, to avoidunnecessary or inapplicable information collection. We believe it prudentto keep these two reporting requirements distinct.<T3>Proposed andSection; 2.28(a). </T3>As proposed, andSection; 2.28(a) wouldrequire the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the facility, the attendingveterinarian, and the chairman of the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee (Committee) to sign the annual report. Proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(9)would require a statement by the CEO that the attending veterinarian andthe Committee have the authority to enter any animal area to carry outtheir responsibilities, that the Committee has satisfactorily carried outits responsibilities, and that the facility is in compliance with the Act,regulations, and standards. Section 2.28(c) would require the attendingveterinarian and the Committee chairman to certify the annual report, inaccordance with andSection;andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(iii) and 2.35(g) of the proposedrule.Fifty-five commenters from the research community stated that only theCEO should be required to sign the report. Ninety-six commenters from theresearch community stated that reference to the ``CEO'' in proposed andSection;2.28(b)(9) should be changed to ``institutional official'' to coincidewith the PHS Policy. Four commenters from the research community statedthat the report and assurances are the responsibility of the facility andshould not require other certification. We agree that the assurances ofcompliance required in the report are the responsibility of the institution,not the Committee Chairman or the attending veterinarian, because it isthe ultimate responsibility of the facility to ensure compliance with theAct and the regulations. Therefore, we are revising the rule to requirethat the annual report be signed only by the CEO or a ``responsible institutionalofficial with authority to bind the facility.'' This revision means thatit needn't be the CEO who signs the report, however the institutional officialwho does sign the report must be authorized to bind the facility. We originallyproposed in andSection; 2.28(a) to require the signature of all three individualsas a means of detecting noncompliance at facilities. For example, if anattending veterinarian refused to sign the report, we would suspect thathe or she was, in some way, not satisfied with the facility's administrationof the program of veterinary care. In order to satisfy this concern, whichwe still have, we are also amending proposed andSection; 2.28(a) to includea mechanism for including all dissenting views in the annual report. Thisis described in greater detail below under the discussion of proposed andSection;2.28(c).<T3> Proposed andSection; 2.28(b).</T3> As proposed, andSection; 2.28(b)(1)states that the annual report shall ``[s]how that professionally acceptablestandards governing the care, treatment, and use of animals, * * * werefollowed by the research facility; * * *''. We received 411 comments (386from the research community and 25 from members of the general public)objecting to use of the word ``show'' and stating that the report can onlystate this fact, not show it. We received 168 comments from the researchcommunity suggesting that we change ``show'' to ``ensure'' or ``assure.''A number of the commenters pointed out that facilities must show theircompliance with the Act and regulations through inspections, as requiredby section 13 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)). We agree with the commentersand have changed ``show'' to ``assure'' in andSection; 2.31(b)(1) of therevised rule. We have also revised the rule to require assurance that professionallyacceptable standards were followed during pre- and post-procedural care,in place of pre- and post-surgical care, because adequate veterinary caremust be provided for all procedures in accordance with the Act.Proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(2) requires an assurance in the annual reportthat the principal investigator has considered alternatives to painfulprocedures. We received 313 comments (288 from the research community and25 from members of the general public) suggesting that we combine thisassurance with proposed paragraph (b)(7) and that we clarify paragraph(b)(2). Proposed paragraph (b)(7) requires the names and numbers of animalsupon which painful procedures were conducted and pain relieving drugs werewithheld. A detailed statement of explanation as to why drugs were notused must be attached to the annual report. We disagree with the commenters.Section 13 of the Act requires that alternatives be considered for allprocedures likely to produce pain or distress (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)(B)(i)).This requirement applies to all painful procedures, whether or not thepain is relieved. Accordingly, paragraph (b)(2) requires assurances thatalternatives were considered with respect to all painful procedures, regardlessof whether or not pain relieving drugs are used or withheld. Proposed paragraph(b)(2) is far broader than the limited circumstances covered in paragraph(b)(7), which is limited to painful procedures for which pain relievingdrugs (anesthetics, analgesics, or tranquilizing drugs) are withheld.By design, the assurance required in proposed paragraph (b)(2), that alternativesto painful procedures were considered, precedes proposed paragraphs (b)(5) and (6) which concern painful or potentially painful procedures. Proposedparagraph (b)(5) pertains to procedures involving no pain, distress, oruse of pain relieving drugs. Proposed paragraph (b)(6) pertains to painfulprocedures for which pain relieving drugs were administered. The assurancerequired in andSection; 2.28(b)(2) would apply to the procedures in the succeedingparagraphs. If the requirement for assurance that alternatives to painfulprocedures have been considered were combined with proposed paragraph (b)(7)it could be construed as pertaining only to those procedures for whichpain relieving drugs are withheld, contrary to the requirement of the Act.For this reason, no changes will be made to paragraph proposed (b)(2) inthe revised rule, or to its placement within the section.Although we did not receive any comments concerning the specific provisionsof proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(3) which requires assurance that the facilityis adhering to the standards and regulations under the Act and that anexplanation for any deviation from them be attached to the annual report,we are revising it to include assurance that the facility required thatexceptions to the standards and regulations be specified and explainedin an ACUP and approved by the Committee. We believe that these changesare consistent with the requirements of section 13(a)(7) of the Act (7U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)) and with andSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35 of this revisedrule.We received 391 comments (366 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to the requirement of proposed paragraph(b)(4) that the annual report state the location of facilities where animalsare housed or used in actual research, testing, teaching, or experimentation.One commenter stated a concern that if facilities must provide the specificsites within the facilities where animals are held, the information wouldbe accessible to the public through the Freedom of Information Act andcould compromise their security.It is necessary for APHIS to know the location of animals at research facilitiesin order to inspect all animal sites, as required by the Act. This informationis essential for enforcement purposes, as evidenced by the case of a researchfacility at a major university which maintained nonhuman primates for years,hidden from APHIS inspectors, by failing to disclose the animal site toAPHIS. We believe the commenters' concerns about revealing the location of animalareas are unwarranted. This information has been required in the annualreport since the regulations were revised in 1972 to incorporate the 1970amendments to the Act, and there is no indication that a facility's securitywas compromised because third persons learned the whereabouts of laboratoryanimals through Freedom of Information Act requests. Furthermore, onceAPHIS has inspected a facility, an inspection form is completed which detailsthe location of animals at each site. This form is filed with the Agencyand may potentially be disclosed through Freedom of Information Act requests.Therefore, leaving this information out of the annual report may not preventthird persons from obtaining the information. We are clarifying proposed paragraph (b)(4) in the revised rule to alsorequire the location of the facility or facilities where animals are heldfor future use in research, testing, teaching, or experimentation, to avoidany confusion that we are only requiring this information for animals inactual use. Since deletion of this requirement would not have the effect intended bythe commenters, and since the information is necessary for the Departmentto comply with the Act, paragraph (b)(4) will remain as proposed exceptfor the above clarification. Thirty-five commenters from the research community stated that facilitiesshould be required to identify animals by their scientific names on theannual report, rather than by their common names, in order to obtain factualinformation and for accuracy in the collection and utilization of the information.One commenter stated that this information is necessary for the publicand the legislators, so that policy regarding the use of animals in researchcan be appropriately established. Proposed paragraphs (b) (5) through (8)of andSection; 2.28(b) would require facilities to ``[s]tate the common namesand the numbers of animals'' maintained or used for the various purposesdescribed in those paragraphs. The requirement to identify animals by theircommon names has been part of the annual report since the report was firstestablished under the 1970 amendments to the Act. Common names are likewiseused in the Department's annual report to Congress. No problems or difficultiesarising from the reporting system for facilities or the use of common namesof animals have become apparent to us. Based upon our experience, we donot believe that it is necessary to require use of scientific names onannual reports. We received 92 comments from the research community statingthat the requirement of proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(6) to report the numberof animals ``upon which experiments, teaching, research, surgery, or testswere conducted involving accompanying pain or distress to the animals''with the use of pain relieving drugs, and of proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(7)to report the number of animals similarly used but for which the use ofpain relieving drugs would adversely affect the procedures and are withheld,exceeds the Department's statutory authority. Proposed paragraph (b)(7)also provides that ``[a] detailed statement on the procedures producingpain or distress in these animals and explaining the reasons such drugswere not used shall be attached to the annual report.'' Thirty commentersfrom the research community objected to this requirement as exceeding thestatutory authority, and 369 commenters (344 from the research communityand 25 members of the general public) objected to this requirement andsuggested that we change it to conform with the statutory language whichrequires ``information on procedures likely to produce pain or distressin any animal * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)(B)). We disagree with these commenters; we have the statutory authority to requirethe information in the form proposed. One of the stated purposes of the Act is to ``insure that animals intendedfor use in research facilities * * * are provided humane care and treatment;* * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2131). Another is to provide requirements to ``ensurethat animal pain and distress are minimized * * * with the appropriateuse of anesthetic, analgesic, tranquilizing drugs, or euthanasia; * * *''(7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(A)). Accordingly, section 13(a)(3)(E) of the Act allows``exception to such standards * * * only when specified by research protocoland that any such exception shall be detailed and explained in a reportoutlined under paragraph (7) and filed with the Institutional Animal Committee''(7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(E)). Paragraph (7)(A) of section 13(a) of the Actmandates that the Secretary ``shall require each research facility to showupon inspection, and to report at least annually, that the provisions ofthis Act are being followed and that professionally acceptable standardsgoverning the care, treatment, and use of animals are being followed bythe research facility during actual research or experimentation.'' (7 U.S.C.2143(a)(7)(A)). Paragraph (7)(B) of section 13(a) requires research facilitiesto provide:<ITAG tagnum="21">(i) Information on procedures likely to produce pain or distress inany animal and assurances demonstrating that the principal investigatorconsidered alternatives to those procedures; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that such facility isadhering to the standards described in this section; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(iii) an explanation for any deviation from the standards promulgatedunder this section. (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)(B)).</ITAG>We believe that these provisions of the Act authorize the Secretary torequire the common names and the numbers of all animals upon which painfulprocedures were conducted. The required information is necessary to enableus to determine, upon inspection and through annual reports of facilities,that the Act is being complied with, and that the intent of Congress_toensure that research animal pain and distress are minimized_is being advanced.The Agency must be able to make this determination in order to fulfillour annual reporting obligation to Congress, in accordance with section25 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2155). The additional requirement in proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(7) for a detailedstatement explaining the reasons why pain relieving drugs, which are requiredby the Act unless it is scientifically necessary to withhold them, werenot used, is mandated by section 13 of the Act, as set forth above. Thestatement is a necessary component of a facility's assurance that the provisionsof the Act are being followed, ``that professionally acceptable standardsgoverning the care, treatment, and use of animals are being followed bythe research facility during actual research or experimentation,'' andthat the ``facility is adhering to the standards * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(7)(A) and (B)). Current andSection; 2.28(a)(4) contains a similar requirementfor a ``brief statement'' explaining why pain relieving drugs have beenwithheld. We believe the proposal to require a detailed statement of reasonsfor not using pain relieving drugs reflects the intent of Congress in amendingthe Act and that this requirement is mandated by section 13 of the Act(7 U.S.C. 2143(a)). For these reasons, paragraphs (b) (6) and (7) remainas proposed in andSection; 2.31 of the revised rule. Six commenters from the research community stated that the requirementof proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(8) to report the number of animals beingbred, conditioned or held for use, teaching, testing, experiments, research,or surgery, but not yet used, should be revised to reflect more accuratelythe number of animals held for use but not used. One commenter expressedconcern that the number of unused animals at a facility is highly variableand changes daily so that the annual report would not provide an accuratefigure. It would also not be an accurate means of determining the numberof animals held by all facilities since animals are transferred betweenfacilities and would be counted multiple times. In addition, some animalsmay be used in a procedure, and then held for another use, and would becounted at least twice: once as an animal used for teaching, testing, experiments,research, or surgery under paragraphs (b) (5), (6), or (7), and a secondtime as an animal being bred, conditioned, or held for use, teaching, testing,an experiment, research, or surgery under paragraph (b)(8). We do not believe that it is necessary to revise paragraph (b)(8). Thatparagraph requires an accounting of all animals that have not yet beenused and are being bred, conditioned, or held for future use by a facility.It is true that a transferred animal would be included in the annual reportof each facility in which it is placed since it would be ``new'' to thatfacility. It is also true that an animal that was used in a procedure thatis completed and is being held for use in another procedure would be includedunder paragraph (b)(8). We received 314 comments (289 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) suggesting that the substance of paragraph(b)(8) should be combined with paragraph (b)(4) so that there is a singlerequirement for reporting the number of animals at a facility. We disagree.Proposed paragraph (b)(4) of andSection; 2.28 pertains to location of animalsat a facility, not the number of animals. These are two distinct reportingrequirements which the Department uses separately in the Department's annualreport to Congress. Combining these requirements would complicate our reportsand would not reduce the effort required of reporting facilities to presentthis data. Since there would be no beneficial effect gained from adoptingthe commenters' suggestion, both requirements remain in the revised rule. Proposed paragraph (b)(9) of andSection; 2.28 would require a statementby the CEO in the annual report stating: (1) That the attending veterinarianand the Committee members have authority to enter any animal area in thefacility at any reasonable time to carry out their responsibilities underthe regulations; (2) that the Committee has satisfactorily carried outits responsibilities; and (3) that the facility is in compliance with theAct, regulations, and standards. We received 305 comments (280 from theresearch community and 25 from members of the general public) stating thatthe statement concerning access by the attending veterinarian and the Committeemembers to animal areas is redundant and unnecessary because it would beincluded within the assurances of compliance required in proposed paragraphs(b) (1) and (3). The commenters also objected to requiring the CEO's signature.We believe it is appropriate to require a separate statement by the CEOaddressing these three concerns. Although paragraphs (b) (1) and (3) ofproposed andSection; 2.28 generally address compliance with the standardsand regulations, we feel it is important that the CEO or responsible institutionalofficial with authority to bind the facility bear responsibility for assuringthat the statements made in the annual report are accurate and that thefacility is in compliance. We believe that this accountability is necessaryto ensure that the annual reports are meaningful and reliable. For the reasons provided above in connection with proposed andSection; 2.28(a),either the Chief Executive Officer or the ``responsible institutional officialwith authority to bind the facility'' may make the required statement inthe annual report, and andSection; 2.31(b)(9) is revised accordingly, inresponse to the comments received. Thirty-seven commenters from the research community stated that the term``reasonable time'' in proposed andSection; 2.28(b)(9) should be defined,and 344 commenters (319 from the research community and 25 members of thegeneral public) stated that the Committee members should not be allowedunrestricted entry to animal areas at any time if entry would interferewith ongoing research or the protection of proprietary information. Thirtycommenters suggested that the Committee members and the attending veterinarianshould have ``reasonable access'' to animal areas instead of ``authorityto enter any animal area, at any reasonable time'' as proposed. The commentersstated that allowing reasonable access would prevent undue disturbanceof the animals or controlled environmental conditions, prevent interferencewith research, and would protect proprietary information. The commenterssuggested that ``reasonable access'' would require consultation with theprincipal investigator before entry into an animal area if research isbeing conducted, unless the Committee has reason to believe there is aproblem related to animal welfare.We do not believe that ``reasonable time'' requires additional clarificationin the regulations. Research facilities can clarify what is a reasonabletime through their written procedures or through guidelines issued by theCEO or responsible institutional official with authority to bind the facility.As previously explained in the discussion of Subpart C under the subheading,``andSection; 2.30(c),'' it is not our intent to interfere with ongoing research,but we feel strongly that the Committee must have authority to enter allanimal and research areas at any reasonable time without having to fulfillformal procedures as a prerequisite, and that the attending veterinarianmust have authority to enter all animal or research areas at any time inorder to ensure compliance with the program of adequate veterinary care.Section 2.31(b)(9) is revised to reflect this change. We do not intendthat the Committee and attending veterinarian make a practice of barginginto animal areas, and in this respect we agree that the principal investigatorshould be consulted as the commenter suggests. We do not believe it isappropriate to include a requirement for this in the regulations, however.Each facility is free to establish guidelines or a policy regarding consultationand to establish its own written procedures. We will retain the requirementthat the annual report contain a statement, signed by the CEO or responsibleinstitutional official, certifying that the Committee members have authorityto enter any animal or research area at any reasonable time in order tocarry out their responsibilities, and that the attending veterinarian ispermitted access to all animal or research areas at any time.<T3> Proposed andSection; 2.28(c).</T3> We proposed in andSection; 2.28(c)that the annual report be certified by the attending veterinarian and theCommittee Chairman, in addition to being signed by the CEO under paragraph(a). We also proposed in andSection; 2.28(c) that the annual report indicatethe concurrence or nonconcurrence of the nonaffiliated member of the Committee. Four commenters from the research community stated that the report andits assurances should be the responsibility of the CEO and should not requireany other certifications. We received 370 comments (345 from the researchcommunity and 25 from members of the general public) stating that the entireparagraph should be deleted since the signature of the CEO required inparagraph (a) would be sufficient. One commenter was concerned that theproposed certification requirements improperly placed the burden of responsibilityfor the facility's compliance on the attending veterinarian and the CommitteeChairman, and that at most they should be required certify to performanceof their duties and fulfillment of their responsibilities. Others wereconcerned with the veto power given the attending veterinarian and theCommittee Chairman, and the potential for abuse. One commenter noted thatrequiring the attending veterinarian to certify the annual report couldplace members of the Committee at odds with each other by giving one memberthe power that the Committee as a whole should have, and that this wouldundermine the ability of the Committee to perform its intended role.Having considered the comments, we have determined that only the CEO orresponsible institutional official with authority to bind the facilityneed sign and certify the annual report. Therefore, we are deleting therequirement from proposed andSection; 2.28(c) that the attending veterinarianand Committee Chairman certify the annual report. The requirement thatthe CEO or responsible institutional official sign the annual report isalready contained in paragraph (a) of andSection; 2.31 in the revised rule,and we are adding a requirement that this official must also certify thereport. We received 179 comments from the research community stating that the requirementcontained in proposed andSection; 2.28(c) that the nonaffiliated member ofthe Committee indicate concurrence or nonconcurrence with the annual reportshould be deleted. Three members of the general public and one member ofthe research community stated that the annual report should reflect alldissenting opinions, and not single out the nonaffiliated member of theCommittee. Some of the commenters pointed out that the Act, in Section13, provides a mechanism for filing a minority view in connection withthe inspection certification report prepared by the Committee (7 U.S.C.2143(b)(4)(A)). The commenters further point out that the Committee reportis separate from the annual report of the facility, and that the nonaffiliatedmember's view would appear to be irrelevant for purposes of submittingthe facility's annual report. Upon reconsideration of the requirement, we agree with the commenters thatthe emphasis on the concurrence or nonconcurrence of the nonaffiliatedmember of the Committee should be broadened to provide for the concurrenceor nonconcurrence of any member of the Committee. We have revised thisrequirement to give all members of the Committee an equal opportunity toexpress a minority or nonconcurring view. To assure that the members areafforded this opportunity, the CEO or responsible institutional officialwith authority to bind the facility will be required to certify that heor she circulated the report to the Committee members for their reviewand that each was advised that they could add a minority report or indicatetheir nonconcurrence. We intend that the report would be circulated toeach member with an attached routing slip containing a blank space in whichthe member could indicate that he or she read the report and concurredor did not concur, and that he or she was attaching a minority report tobe included with the annual report. The slip would be replaced with a newblank slip for each Committee member's review. In this manner, confidentialitybetween the responsible institutional official and between each memberof the Committee would be maintained. The annual report must contain aspace in which the CEO or responsible institutional official states thatall Committee members had an opportunity to indicate nonconcurrence, andto state whether any minority reports are attached. As stated above, theCEO or responsible institutional official would be required to certifythese statements. We believe that this requirement will allow each member an opportunityto express dissent from the annual report and that his or her opinion willbe forwarded to the Department. This is particularly important for ensuringthat the nonaffiliated member is not excluded from Committee functions.The nonaffiliated member's purpose is to provide representation for generalcommunity interests, and this may or may not result in that member beingat odds with the other members of the Committee. We are aware of circumstanceswhere the nonaffiliated member of the Committee has been prevented frommeaningful participation in Committee functions or shut out of Committeemeetings altogether because he or she presents a contrary or unpopularview. This mechanism should alert the Department to the need for furtherinspections or investigations of the facility. Accordingly, andSection; 2.28(c)is revised to provide for the concurrence or nonconcurrence of all membersof the Committee with the annual report. Section 2.35 Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee The remaining provisions of andSection; 2.35 in the revised rule are thoseareas either specifically assigned by the Act to the Committee or necessaryto implement the provisions of the Act which mandate Committee action.Many of the comments we received concerning andSection; 2.35 as proposedhave been addressed under the headings, ``Introduction,'' ``General,''and ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35.'' The commentswe received addressing the remaining provisions are discussed below. Unlessotherwise noted, the comments were received from members of the researchcommunity. <T3>General. </T3>We received a number of comments addressing proposedandSection; 2.35 and the role of the Committee in general. Some commentswere made concerning use of the Committee as an instrumentality of thefacility, both for enforcing the regulations and for performing tasks assignedto the facilities by the Act. The reassignment of responsibilities is fullydetailed in a preceding section of this supplementary information, underthe heading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35.'' Two commenters from the general public stated that the Committees werenot given adequate authority in the proposed regulations. The Act prescribesthe areas of authority delegated to the Committee and the revised ruleis in accordance with the Act. The research facilities remain free to delegateauthority to the Committee to perform additional duties on behalf of thefacility. We believe it is best to leave this determination to the researchfacilities.Fourteen members of the general public commented that the Department shouldpromulgate national standards, instead of delegating responsibility tothe Committees. We are proposing to do so in the proposed rule for Part3_``Standards,'' published elsewhere in this issue. (<T3>See </T3>companion docket no. 87-004.) Part 3 provides the standardsfor the humane handling, care, treatment, and transportation of differentanimals covered by the Act. The Act requires that the Committees inspectthe facilities for compliance with the Act and regulations and assess andreport on animal care at the facility. The Committee is necessarily responsiblefor approving deviations from the standards as part of its duties underthe Act; however it does not set the standards. We believe the concernof the commenters has been addressed in proposed Part 3. We received 168 comments objecting to proposed andSection; 2.35, on the basisthat it would require extensive recordkeeping and reporting requirementsbeyond those required by the Act. We acknowledge that andSection; 2.35 willadd new recordkeeping and reporting requirements, however, these are allmandated by the Act and are necessary in order to assure compliance withthe Act, regulations, and standards. <T3>Membership. </T3>We received 2 comments from members of the generalpublic suggesting that the regulations provide protection for Committeemembers from possible reprisals. Similar committees have existed in accordancewith the PHS Policy at institutions receiving grants or awards under theHealth Research Extension Act of 1985, without incident, to our knowledge.We do not feel it necessary to include regulations to protect Committeemembers at this time. Two commenters stated that having the chief executive officer (CEO) ofthe research facility select the Committee members, as proposed in andSection;2.35(a)(2), biases the Committee. Section 13(b)(1) of the Act states that``[e]ach Committee shall be appointed by the chief executive officer ofeach such facility * * *'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)). This is not a matterwithin the Department's discretion and the regulation will necessarilyremain as proposed. We received 465 comments (440 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the CEO should be allowed to delegatehis or her responsibilities under the Act. Delegation of authority is amatter left to the facilities in accordance with their charter and by-laws.Delegation should only be to an administrative official who is not involvedin the actual conduct of research, however, in order to comply with theintent of the Act that the Committee members be selected by a legally responsibleofficial who is in a position to select a suitable Committee as describedby the Act. No change is required in the regulations since this is an internalinstitutional matter. Paragraph (a)(4) of proposed andSection; 2.35 states that Committee members``shall possess sufficient ability to assess animal care, treatment, andpractices in experimental research as determined by the needs of the researchfacility.'' One commenter expressed concern that the paragraph seems tostate that each individual Committee member must possess ``expertise''in animal care, treatment, and practices in experimental research. Thecommenter recommended that the paragraph be clarified to state that theCommittee as a whole must have this expertise, but not each and every singlemember. We disagree with the commenter. The plain language of paragraph(a)(4) is sufficiently clear and is taken from the Act which provides thatCommittee members must have sufficient ability to assess animal care, andrelated matters. Committee members must possess some knowledge of animals,but ``expertise'' in these areas is not required. This ability is requiredfor each of the Committee members, not just for the Committee as a whole.Another commenter stated that ``special'' ability to assess animal careshould not be required. It is not. Paragraph (4) requires ``sufficient''ability to assess animal care, not ``special'' ability. Section 2.35(a)(4)remains as originally proposed. Paragraph (a)(5)(i) of proposed andSection; 2.35 states that of the Committeemembers, ``At least one shall be a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine who isthe attending veterinarian for the research facility and who is accreditedby the U.S. Department of Agriculture in accordance with regulations issuedby the Secretary under the Animal Welfare Act; * * *.'' As explained ina related document published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, docket no. 88-013, Part 1_``Definition of Terms,''we are removing references to ``accreditation'' from these regulationspending the Department's renaming and development of standards for theAnimal Welfare ``accreditation'' program. We received 398 comments (373 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that research facilities should be giventhe flexibility of assigning another staff veterinarian to the Committeein place of the attending veterinarian. There is nothing in the Act orregulations to prevent research facilities from delegating the duties ofthe attending veterinarian on the Committee to another veterinarian; however,final responsibility for those duties rests with the attending veterinarian.Section 2.35(a)(5) is revised to clarify that the duties of the attendingveterinarian may be delegated to a staff veterinarian.Proposed paragraph (a)(5)(ii) of proposed andSection; 2.35 would requirethat of the Committee members, ``At least one shall not be affiliated inany way with such facility other than as a member of the Committee andshall not be a member of the immediate family of a person who is affiliatedwith such facility. The Secretary intends that such person will providerepresentation for general community interests in the proper care and treatmentof animals.'' The requirement to have a nonaffiliated Committee memberis contained in section 13 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)(B)). We receivedmany comments concerning the selection of the nonaffiliated member, particularlyfrom the general public. We received 1,518 comments from members of thegeneral public stating that the regulations should ensure that the nonaffiliatedmember of the Committee is a vigorous and effective community representativeand should not be required to possess the medical ability to assess animalcare. In other words, any person interested in the humane use of animalscould serve on the Committee as the nonaffiliated member. One commenterfrom the research community suggested that the nonaffiliated member beselected from a list of candidates nominated by recognized humane groups.Under the statute, and as provided in the regulations, the CEO of the researchfacility appoints the members of the Committee. Other than the criteriaprovided by the Act and the regulations promulgated under the Act, we donot feel it is appropriate to dictate the manner of selection or to definefurther the members' attributes. Neither the Act nor the regulations requirethat the nonaffiliated member be a veterinarian or medically trained. Nine members of the general public and 1 commenter from the research communitystated that there should be more than one nonaffiliated member servingon the Committee. The Act requires that ``at least one member_(i) shallnot be affiliated in any way with such facility other than as a memberof the Committee * * * '' (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)(B)(i)). The research facilitycan determine to have more than one nonaffiliated member but only one isstatutorily required. Section 2.35(a)(5)(ii) remains as originally proposed.Proposed paragraph (a)(6) of andSection; 2.35 would provide that ``[i]f thecommittee consists of more than three members not more than three membersshall be from the same administrative unit of such facility; * * *.'' Wereceived 465 comments (440 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) requesting that the term ``administrative unit''be defined. We have done so in a related document, docket no. 88-013, Part1_``Definition of Terms,'' published elsewhere in this issue. The term``administrative unit'' would mean the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">The organizational or management unit at the departmental level ofa research facility.</ITAG>Paragraph (7) of proposed andSection; 2.35(a) requires that the facilitymaintain a current list of Committee members containing their names, degrees,positions, qualifications, addresses, and telephone numbers. The attendingveterinarian must maintain a copy of the current list and it must be availablefor inspection by APHIS officials We received 492 comments (467 from theresearch community and 25 from members of the general public) stating thathome addresses and telephone numbers of the Committee members should notbe a part of the records accessible to the public and 108 comments statingthat only the Committee Chairman's business address should be requiredrather than the home addresses of all the Committee members. We agree thatthe list need not contain the home addresses and telephone numbers of theCommittee members and that only the Committee Chairman's business addressand phone number should be required. Paragraph (7) is revised to reflectthis change. <T3>Duties and responsibilities</T3>_1. <T3>General. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2.35(b) specifies the duties and responsibilitiesthat the Committee must perform in accordance with the Act. A number ofthe duties that were contained in this proposed section were not imposedon the Committee by the Act, and have been reassigned to the research facility.A more complete explanation of the reassignment of duties and responsibilities,and precise section references are contained under the heading, ``Reorganizationof andSection;andSection; 2.30 and 2.35.'' 2. <T3>Inspections. </T3>In the supplementary information to the proposedrule, we invited comments addressing how inspections could be carried outat research facilities having a large number of animal sites and studyareas. We received 289 comments stating that the Committee should be allowedto delegate inspection and/or review responsibilities to a subcommitteeor to other personnel, and that their inspection reports could then beevaluated by a quorum of the Committee. We also received 485 comments (460from the research community and 25 from members of the general public)urging APHIS to consult with officials of the U.S. Public Health Serviceon requirements for Committee inspection before promulgating a final rule.The commenters felt that this would be both helpful for the research facilities,which would have to comply with both the Animal Welfare regulations andthe PHS Policy on Committee inspections if they receive grants or awardsunder the Health Research Extension Act of 1985, and for APHIS since thePolicy provides guidelines for the accomplishment of inspections and evaluations.As pointed out by some commenters, at most facilities the same Committeewill be responsible for complying with the Animal Welfare regulations andthe PHS Policy.Representatives from HHS advised the Department that the PHS Policy allowsthe Committee to determine at its discretion ``the specific means to accomplishthe semiannual evaluation of institutional programs and facilities, however,the IACUC remains responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of the evaluationand report.'' Facilities can work within their existing organizationalstructures to accomplish the requisite inspections and evaluations. Underthe PHS Policy, the IACUC can appoint a subcommittee or designate personnelto perform the inspections, as 289 commenters suggested. Having consulted with HHS and having considered the comments we received,we agree that the Committee should be able to appoint subcommittees composedof at least 2 Committee members to perform inspections. We have revisedandSection; 2.35(b) in this rule to allow each Committee at a research facilityto designate a subcommittee to perform inspections, however, no Committeemember who wishes to participate in an inspection may be excluded fromparticipation in that inspection. The right of each Committee member toparticipate in any inspection conducted under Subpart C is set forth inandSection; 2.35(b)(1)(v) of the revised rule. Section 13 of the Act requiresthat all formal actions of the Committee must be performed by a quorumof the Committee, and inspections are specifically included as formal actions(7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(2)). In order to satisfy the Act, andSection; 2.35 is furtherrevised to require the subcommittees to present their findings and recommendations,including inspection certification reports, and Committee recommendationsbased upon inspections, to a quorum of the Committee for formal action.One commenter stated that the Committee should have the authority to suspendactivities as it does under the PHS Policy. We agree with the commenterthat painful procedures that are not in compliance with the Act and regulationsshould be suspended and that this can be accomplished through the Committee.Under the PHS Policy, the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee maysuspend an activity that it previously approved, if it determines thatthe activity is not being conducted in accordance with applicable provisionsof the Animal Welfare Act, the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of LaboratoryAnimals, the institution's Assurance, or the requirements of the PHS Policywhich must be met in order for a proposed research project or a significantchange in a research project to be approved.We believe that authority to suspend approval of ACUPs is necessary forthe Committee to function effectively and to act on behalf of the researchfacility in monitoring compliance. For this reason, we proposed to includein the assurance statement required from the Committee as part of its inspectionreport, a statement that all painful procedures are in accordance withthe ``research protocols'' [ACUPs] approved by the Committee and any approvedchanges to the ``research protocols'' [ACUPS], and that if the procedures``are not in accordance with the approved `protocol' [ACUP] that the investigator(s)has been instructed to cease such methods and procedures immediately andto comply with the `protocols' [ACUPs], procedures, and practices thatwere approved by the Committee.'' (Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i)(D)).We have added paragraph (iv) to andSection; 2.35(b)(1) in this revised ruleto clarify that the Committee has authority to withdraw its approval. Theeffect of Committee withdrawal of approval is provided in andSection; 2.35(b)(3)in the revised rule. The research facility is responsible for directing that the research, testing,or teaching cease, otherwise the facility would not be in compliance withthe regulations. We are requiring in andSection; 2.35(b)(1)(iv) that theCommittee direct the CEO to instruct the principal investigator to ceaseimmediately any research, testing, or teaching involving pain to animalsthat is not in compliance with the approved ACUP, because it is the researchfacility's responsibility to direct cessation of activities that are notin accordance with the approved ACUP. In order to ensure that there isno added delay in ordering cessation of such activities, we are requiringthat the Committee notify the CEO or responsible institutional officialof noncompliance with an approved ACUP involving a painful procedure inits deficiency notification report, as provided in andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(ii).Forty-four commenters objected to the proposed requirement of andSection;2.35(b)(1)(i) that the Committee inspect all animal study areas and animalfacilities at least twice a year, no more than 6 months apart, statingthat it is too specific. Section 13(b)(3) of the Act requires that theCommittee conduct inspections ``at least semiannually'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(3)).We proposed that the inspections be conducted no more than 6 months apartto ensure that the underlying purpose for requiring semiannual inspectionsis carried out, that is, to ensure that throughout the course of the yeareach animal area is in compliance with the Act and the regulations. Theutility of the inspections is maximized if neither too much nor too littletime elapses between inspections. The PHS Policy requires the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee to inspect the institution's animal facilitiesat least once every 6 months. This too seems designed to ensure that thetwice yearly inspections are effectively spaced out over the course ofthe year, and is consistent with the proposed rule. We are revising the requirement for twice yearly inspections to providethat inspections must be performed ``at least twice a year, 6 months apart''rather than ``no more than 6 months apart'' as proposed. We are not requiringthat inspections be performed at precise 6-month intervals to the day,but rather that they be performed at some time during the month or 30-dayperiod in which the Committee performs its inspections. We believe thatthis requirement, as revised, allows facilities sufficient flexibilityand time to conduct inspections. We are also revising the regulations torequire that at research facilities maintaining multiple animal sites,Committee inspections of all animal sites and animal facilities must becompleted within 30 days of commencing the first site inspection so thatthe Committee can complete and file a comprehensive inspection report.This requirement is necessary for APHIS officials and inspectors to havecomplete and current inspection reports to review when inspecting researchfacilities. This requirement is contained in andSection; 2.35(b)(1)(vi) ofthe revised rule. We received 307 comments (282 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) suggesting that first priority for inspections shouldbe given to areas for which exception requests have been submitted in accordancewith proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(1)(iii). We appreciate the concern thatthose animal study areas may require additional attention to ensure thatthey are in compliance with the Act and the regulations; however, the Actrequires at least semiannual inspection of all animal study areas. Thereis no provision in the Act for assigning priorities to the order of inspectionsof the different animal study areas_they must all be inspected. The researchfacility may decide the order of inspections. 3. <T3>Reports. </T3>Under proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2), the Committee isdirected to file an inspection certification report after each inspectionwhich contains the following: (1) The date the inspection was made; (2)the signature of a majority of the Committee members and any minority viewsof the Committee; (3) reports of violations of the regulations, standards,or assurances; (4) deficiencies in animal care or treatment; (5) Committeefindings and recommendations; (6) any deviations from originally approved``protocols'' [ACUPs] that adversely affect animal welfare; (7) notificationto the facility of conditions, deviations, or deficiencies; (8) correctionsmade by the facility; and (9) any other information pertinent to the activitiesof the Committee and to the animal facilities. The report must also includean assurance statement by the Committee that its members have reviewedall painful procedures using animals and that the procedures are in accordancewith approved ACUPs or approved changes to the ACUPs, and, if the proceduresare not in accordance with approved ACUPs, that the investigator has beeninstructed to cease those practices immediately and to comply with theapproved ACUPs. We have revised the proposed rule to require that all inspection certificationreports must be completed and filed by the Committee in a timely fashion.We believe that 10 business days from completion of the site inspectionsrequired under andSection; 2.35(b)(1) is a reasonable timeframe to imposeon the Committee and that it is necessary to ensure that the required informationis on file and is current. We have also revised the rule to reflect the fact that subcommittees ofat least 2 Committee members may perform inspections. This is providedin andSection; 2.35(b)(1)(i) of the revised rule. The subcommittee must presentits findings to a quorum of Committee members for formal action, as requiredunder andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i) of the revised rule. Under proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(ii), the Committee must notify theresearch facility of deficiencies found during an inspection. If the deficienciesremain uncorrected 30 days after notification and opportunity for correction,the Committee must notify the Administrator and any funding Federal agencyand provide them with a copy of the report and the notification given tothe facility. The Committee must also provide any APHIS inspector and anyfunding Federal agency of the project with a copy of any report showingdeficiencies in complying with the regulations and standards which remainuncorrected. We received 471 comments (446 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to the requirement of proposed andSection;2.35(b)(2)(i) that the Committee's inspection certification reports beavailable to APHIS officials and to officials of funding Federal agenciesfor copying. Under section 13 of the Act, the Committee reports must bekept on file for at least 3 years at the facility and must be availablefor inspection by APHIS and any funding Federal agency (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(4)(B)).It is necessary for APHIS inspectors to be able to copy reports to obtaindocumentation of noncompliance and to conduct investigations of possiblenoncompliance. These are the occasions when inspectors would need to copythe Committee reports. The requirement remains as initially proposed. We received 307 comments (282 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that the Committee should not be requiredto monitor projects on an ongoing basis to assess deviations from originallyapproved protocols [ACUPs], as required by the assurance statement thatis part of the Committee's report under proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i)(D).This requirement is mandated by section 13(b)(4)(A) of the Act. It requiresthat the Committee's report include ``any deficient conditions of animalcare or treatment, any deviations of research practices from originallyapproved proposals that adversely affect animal welfare, * * * '' (7 U.S.C.2143(b)(4)(A)). Ongoing practices and procedures must necessarily be reviewedin order to comply with this requirement. No change is made in the revisedrule based upon this comment. We received 321 comments (296 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) objecting to the assurance statement requiredin proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i)(D) on the grounds that it is too complicated.We have simplified the assurance by using the term ``ACUP'' in place of``research protocols, procedures, and practices'' as originally proposed,since this term encompasses the areas of concern to the Committee in reviewingpainful procedures. Also, as explained above, the instruction to ceaseusing methods and procedures that are not in compliance with the approvedACUP must come from the research facility because the CEO or responsibleinstitutional institutional official must certify compliance with the Act,regulations, and standards on the facility's annual report, and must reportany deviations from the regulations. The Committee can be required onlyto provide assurance regarding matters of which it has first-hand knowledge.Accordingly, paragraph (b)(2)(i)(D)(3) is revised to require assurancethat the Committee has notified the CEO or responsible institutional officialof the research facility to instruct the investigator to cease using thenoncomplying methods and procedures. We received 527 comments (502 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) stating that research facilities shouldbe allowed more than 30 days to correct deficiencies found in the courseof Committee inspections. We received 149 comments suggesting a means ofrequesting an extension in the event that a deficiency cannot be correctedwithin 30 days for justifiable reasons, such as if more time is requiredto purchase new primary enclosures or to repair the physical plant. Wedo not agree with the commenters' suggestion that the regulations shouldprovide a formal means of requesting an extension of time to correct deficiencies.Rather, APHIS will continue to consider non-compliance matters on a case-by-casebasis, as it has in the past. Two commenters requested clarification of the requirement contained inproposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(ii) for reporting deficiencies to the DeputyAdministrator. As previously explained, the reference to the Deputy Administratoris changed to the Administrator. We have revised the notification procedureto reflect the fact that the facility is ultimately responsible for compliancewith the Act and regulations, and that the CEO or responsible insitutitionalofficial must certify the facility's compliance in the annual report. Accordingly,andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(ii) is revised to require that the Committee notifythe CEO of the research facility or the official responsible for animalcare if the CEO has delegated authority to that official, as well as theadministrative unit representative, of any deficiencies found, includingnoncompliance with an approved ACUP involving a painful procedure. Thisnotification must be done, in writing, within one business day of discovery.The Committee must also provide a copy of its inspection certificationreport citing a deficiency to the CEO or the institutional official responsiblefor animal care, and to the administrative unit representative. The facilitythen has 30 days to correct the deficiency. If it remains uncorrected 30days after notification of the CEO or other responsible institutional official,the Committee must notify the Administrator and any funding Federal agencyof the uncorrected deficiency in accordance with section 13(b)(4)(C) ofthe Act (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(4)(C)). We are requiring that this must be donewithin 5 days of completion of the 30-day correction period to avoid furtherdelay. The Committee must provide a copy of its inspection certificationreport and a copy of its written notification of deficiency to the Administrator.The Committee must also file a copy of its inspection certification reportand written notification of deficiencies at the central repository maintainedby the facility in accordance with andSection; 2.30(m) for all reports requiredin this Subchapter so that they are available to APHIS officials and inspector(s),and to any funding Federal agency. The proposed rule erroneously referredto the ``administrative representative'' and not to the ``administrativeunit representative'' as intended. Section 2.35(b)(2)(ii) of the revisedrule reflects these changes. We did not receive any comments addressing proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(iv),which requires that reports remain on file for at least 3 years at theresearch facility and be available for inspection and review by APHIS inspectorsand any funding Federal agency. This requirement is set forth in andSection;2.30(m) of this rule, and it is revised to require that, upon notificationfrom the Administrator, research facilities must also retain records pendingcompletion of an investigation or proceeding under the Act, and until theirdisposition is authorized by the Administrator.4.<T3> Reviews.</T3> Following the reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30and 2.35, and the reassignment of duties and responsibilities so that onlystatutorily mandated duties are imposed on the Committee, and the revisionsto Subpart C described above, the remaining reviewing functions of theCommittee under the proposed rule would be as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21"> (i) No research, testing, or teaching involving [ACUPs] falling underCategories 3 and 4 in this paragraph performed by a facility's personnelat any location shall commence prior to approval by the Committee [of theACUP]. Prior to granting approval, the Committee shall ensure that [ACUPs]in any of the categories listed [in the Categories of Animal Use in Researchand Testing] contain provisions for acceptable and proper animal care,treatment, practices, methods, and use of pain-relieving drugs. (ProposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(ii)).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"> (ii) The Committee shall approve an [ACUP] only when animal pain,distress, and functional or sensory impairment are minimized; all survivalsurgery is performed using aseptic procedures; adequate veterinary careis planned for and provided; multiple use of such animal(s) is justifiedfor the purpose of conserving an endangered species or marine mammals oras an essential related component of a particular project or [ACUP]; andthe appropriate use of anesthetics, analgesics, tranquilizing drugs, oreuthanasia, when necessary, and that the use of such drugs is in accordancewith established or accepted veterinary medical procedures and usage. Theuse of such drugs shall be in accordance with the instructions of the attendingveterinarian.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="20">(Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iii)).</ITAG>As previously discussed under the heading ``andSection; 2.30(d),'' we havedetermined that the Committee must review and approve all ACUPs beforeany research, testing, or teaching involving animals can commence, andandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(i) of this revised rule (formerly proposed andSection;2.35(b)(3)(ii)) is revised accordingly. Requiring review of all ACUPs,not just those involving painful procedures, is consistent with PHS Policyand avoids the need for determining the degree of pain or distress thatcan reasonably be anticipated to result from a proposed procedure. We had originally proposed that ``no research, testing, or teaching involvingprotocols falling under Categories 3 and 4 of the Categories of AnimalUse in Research and Teaching performed by a facility's personnel at anylocation shall commence prior to approval by the Committee.'' (ProposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(ii)). Using the ``Categories of Animal Use in Researchand Testing'' was proposed as a means of classifying animal proceduresinto 4 categories, ranging from those involving little or no pain or distressto those involving severe or unrelieved pain or distress. The Committeewould be required to review the ACUPs for procedures falling in the categoriesinvolving higher degrees of pain, Categories 3 and 4, to ensure that theycontained provisions for acceptable and proper animal care, treatment,practices, methods, and use of pain relieving drugs. Examples of the typesof procedures typically falling into the different categories were providedin the proposed Categories of Animal Use. We received numerous and varied comments regarding the proposed Categories,ranging from general approval and suggestions that the proposed categoriesbe incorporated into the Annual Report (VS Form 18-23) (12 commenters)to disapproval and suggestions that they be deleted because the commentersfound them confusing and/or inappropriate (77 commenters). Four commentersrecommended that the proposed categories be revised to include additionaldetail, including further categorization and definition. It became clear from our review of the comments that a fair number ofthe commenters were misconstruing the proposed examples as fixed categorizationsof procedures into the 4 proposed categories. This was certainly not ourintent in providing the examples. As stated in the supplementary informationaccompanying the proposed rule at 52 FR 10302, ``[t]hese [Categories ofAnimal Use in Research and Teaching] are for the guidance of the investigatorin planning the research protocol [ACUP] and for the Committee in determiningthe level of pain or distress to be allowed and the necessity of such painor distress when approving the protocol [ACUP] * * *. The list of examplesis not all inclusive but is provided as guidance for where a particularprotocol [ACUP] might be classified in relation to the pain or distressinvolved.'' Despite this explanation of the examples provided for each category, wereceived 72 comments objecting to all toxicity studies being classifiedas Category 3. Toxicity studies were included as an example of the typeof procedure which would typically but not necessarily fall under Category3 as involving ``significant but unavoidable pain or distress to the animals.''A toxicity study which did not involve this level of pain or distress wouldnot be in Category 3 under the proposed rule. Other comments addressing the proposed Categories of Animal Use includedone from a member of the general public suggesting that a fifth categoryfor ``severe pain'' be included, and one from a member of the researchcommunity generally approving of the proposed categories.The proposed Categories of Animal Use was selected from among several likecategorizations and was developed by the Scientists Center for Animal Welfare.This categorization was the result of many conferences and seminars addressingthe issue of how to classify procedures involving differing levels of painand is currently in use in 20 or more research facilities. As a resultof the comments received, we have considered a number of alternatives foraddressing the concerns raised by the commenters. One alternative consideredwas using a different categorization system. It is likely, however, thatsimilar issues would be raised in response to any proposed categorizationof types of procedures. We also considered proposing additional examplesof the types of procedures that would typically fall into the differentcategories, in response to the comments requesting additional definitionand categorization, however these too could be misconstrued as fixed categorizationsrather than as examples provided for guidance. We next considered removingthe examples from the rule to avoid any misconception as to whether theywere actually fixed categorizations. This would likely raise concerns thatthe regulations did not provide sufficient guidance and would leave facilitiessubject to challenge if they did not require their Committees to reviewprocedures regarded by the Department as involving significant pain ordistress. Having carefully considered the comments and the various alternatives summarizedabove, we have determined to remove the Categories of Animal Use in Researchand Teaching and to require Committee review and approval of all proceduresinvolving warm-blooded animals covered by the Act. As stated above, webelieve that it is necessary that the Committee review all ACUPs to enableresearch facilities to provide assurance that their facilities are in compliancewith the Act, regulations, and standards. Without this review, the CEOor institutional official with responsibility for animal care could not,in good faith, certify the facility's compliance in its annual report.This requirement will avoid subjective determinations as to how to categorizepain or distress and challenges to those determinations after the proceduresin question have been undertaken. This approach is consistent with PHSPolicy and similar practices already exist at many of the institutionsresponsible for complying with these regulations. Accordingly, the requirementfor Committee review and approval of all ACUPs will not disrupt the practicesemployed at many research facilities. We are also revising the rule to relieve the burden this requirement willimpose upon the Committee by incorporating, in part, the practice authorizedby the PHS Policy for assigning ACUPs to individual members of the Committeefor preliminary review, unless a Committee member requests in-depth reviewby a quorum of the Committee. Under the revised rule, the reviewing memberof the Committee is responsible for reviewing an assigned ACUP and foradvising the principal investigator if modification is needed in orderto obtain the necessary Committee approval. The Committee member must presenthis or her findings to a quorum of the Committee for formal action andmust recommend approval or disapproval of the ACUP. A quorum of the Committeemust approve the ACUP before the proposed research, testing, or teachingcan proceed. One commenter noted that the PHS Policy allows an individualCommittee member to approve a proposed research project. We are requiringCommittee approval of ACUPs in accordance with the section 13(b)(2) ofthe Act which requires a quorum for all formal actions of the Committee(7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(2)). One member of the general public commented that unanimous approval by theCommittee should be required for all protocols [ACUPs]. This is contraryto the Act, which requires a quorum for all formal actions of the Committee(7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(2)). ``Quorum'' is defined by the Act as a majority ofthe Committee members (7 U.S.C. 2132(m)). No change is made in the revisedrule based upon this comment. Also, in accordance with PHS Policy, we are providing a mechanism to enablethe Committee to require that an approved practice or procedure be suspended,in accordance with proposed and revised andSection; 2.35(b)(2)(i)(D), ifit determines that a procedure or practice is not being performed in accordancewith the approved ACUP. We are providing that the Committee can do so bywithdrawing or suspending its approval of an ACUP. Section 2.30(d) requiresCommittee approval for all ACUPs before they commence, and section 13(a)(3)(E)of the Act requires that any exceptions to the standards be specified inthe ACUP and explained in a report filed with the Committee (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(E)).Accordingly, once Committee approval is withdrawn, the procedure or practicemust cease or the research facility is in violation of the regulations.Section 2.35(b)(3)(i) of the revised rule is changed to provide that noresearch, testing, or teaching involving warm-blooded animals covered bythe Act shall continue if the Committee suspends its approval. Eight commenters from the general public urged that painful experimentsshould not be allowed at all. One of the stated purposes of the 1985 amendmentsto the Act is to minimize animal pain and distress (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(3)).The Act is clear, however, in its direction that except as provided insection 13(a)(6) of the Act, it does not authorize the Secretary to promulgateregulations ``with regard to the design, outlines, or guidelines of actualresearch or experimentation by a research facility as determined by suchfacility; * * * '' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(6)(A)(i)) and the Department thereforedoes not have the authority to prohibit all painful experiments. Three commenters from the general public suggested that in determiningwhether to approve a proposed ACUP, the Committee should compare the publicgain which would result from the research versus the pain inflicted onthe animal. Although the Act does not direct the Committee to make thisjudgment, it does direct the Committee to ensure compliance with the Actto ``minimize pain and distress to animals'' and to inspect research facilitiesfor compliance with the Act, regulations, and standards (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(3)).One of the stated findings of Congress set forth in the Act is that ``measureswhich eliminate or minimize the unnecessary duplication of experimentson animals can result in more productive use of federal funds'' and ``measureswhich help meet the public concern for laboratory animal care and treatmentare important in assuring that research will continue to progress.'' (7U.S.C. 2131). Proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iii) provides the bases uponwhich the Committee will approve or disapprove a proposed ACUP. The basesenumerated include provision for the commenters' concerns. We further believethat the provision for a nonaffiliated member of the Committee who is ``intendedto provide representation for general community interests in proper careand treatment of animals'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(b)(1)(B)(iii)) will bring theseconsiderations to bear in Committee deliberations, and that the Committeeas a whole will keep the purposes of the Act in mind in performing itsduties. No change is made based upon this comment and it is redesignatedas andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(ii) in the revised rule. Two commenters stated that the language in proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iii)should be changed from ``The Committee shall approve such protocols onlywhen * * * '' to ``The Committee shall approve procedures only when * **.'' We have revised this paragraph by replacing the term ``protocol''with ``ACUP.'' We are also numbering the conditions listed in proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iii)in the revised rule which must be satisfied for the Committee to approvean ACUP, and are correcting the typographical and grammatical errors thatappeared in it. We received 478 comments from members of the general public in regard toproposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(ii) concerning the need for stronger andstricter requirements for reporting painful procedures and use of painrelieving drugs, and for better identifying those procedures not involvingpain, procedures involving unrelieved pain, and procedures involving painrelieved with drugs. We have addressed these comments separately from thoseconcerning the proposed Categories of Animal Use because they more properlyconcern the research facility's annual report, VS Form 18-23 than proposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3)(ii). The annual report requires an accounting of thenumber of animals utilized in procedures involving no pain, unrelievedpain, and relieved pain. We are aware of instances where animals are reportedunder Column `C', ``no pain'' because the pain is relieved with drugs.This is improper because the relief of pain does not make the procedureone which does not involve pain. As noted previously, 12 commenters feltthat the proposed Categories of Animal Use should be used on VS Form 18-23,instead of the current designations. We believe that the combination of Committee review of all ACUPs, requiringCommittee approval of all proposed ACUPs before they can commence, Committeeinspections, and the research facility's responsibility to assure thatpain and distress are minimized will result in more accurate reportingof painful procedures. The annual report, VS Form 18-23 will also be clarifiedto require that painful procedures be reported as such, regardless of whetheror not pain is relieved. We received 40 comments stating that ``Committee'' should appear in andSection;2.35(b)(3) of the final rule in place of ``attending veterinarian'' whereverthe phrase ``in accordance with the instructions of the attending veterinarian''appears. The phrase appears in proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3)(iii) onlyin regard to the use of pain relieving drugs. The requirements in the remainingparagraphs of proposed andSection; 2.35(b)(3) are incorporated in andSection;2.30 of the revised rule because they are the responsibility of the researchfacility. Procedures and practices which must be done in accordance withthe instructions of the attending veterinarian, as provided in proposedandSection; 2.35(b)(3), are those which pertain to providing proper veterinarycare, and providing for animal health and well-being, such as the properuse of drugs and pre- and post-procedural care. As explained previously,adequate veterinary care must be provided in all research procedures andis not limited to those involving surgery. Section 2.35(b)(3) of this ruleis revised accordingly. These are areas within the expertise of the attendingveterinarian, as opposed to the Committee, and remain subject to the instructionsof the attending veterinarian in the revised rule.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Subpart D_Attending Veterinarian and Adequate Veterinary Care Introduction</ITAG> As explained above under the heading, ``Subpart C_Institutional AnimalCare and Use Committee and Other Requirements for Research Facilities''and under the subheading, ``Reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30 and2.35,'' in this revised rule we are reassigning responsibility to the researchfacilities for certain duties that had been placed upon the attending veterinarianin the proposed rule. These changes are made in response to the concernsraised by 480 commenters (455 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) who stated that as proposed, andSection; 2.40(e) wouldplace the attending veterinarian in the position of enforcement agent forthe Department. These changes should also allay the concerns of the fourcommenters from the research community who stated that the Committee wasimproperly given veterinary responsibilities in andSection; 2.35 of the proposedrule. With this reorganization of andSection;andSection; 2.30, 2.35, and 2.40, andthe reassignment of responsibilities, we believe that the research facility,the Committee, and the attending veterinarian will serve as an effectivebuilt-in institutional quality assurance mechanism. The Act requires standardsfor adequate veterinary care, and consultation with a veterinarian in theplanning of any painful procedure. The regulations in this revised ruleare intended to ensure proper planning and conduct of research proceduresand adequate veterinary care. Although ultimate responsibility for many of the responsibilities originallyplaced on the Committee and the attending veterinarian in the proposedrule is placed on the research facility in the revised rule, many of theseresponsibilities must still be performed under the guidance or supervisionof the attending veterinarian or in consultation with the attending veterinarianbecause they fall within his or her expertise. Accordingly, andSection; 2.30of this rule has been revised to require each research facility using orholding animals for research, testing, or teaching to establish, maintain,and abide by a written program of adequate veterinary care in accordancewith andSection; 2.40. (A research facility may or may not include the writtenprogram of adequate veterinary care in its standard operating procedure(SOP) if it employs a full-time attending veterinarian.) In Subpart D, paragraph (e) of proposed andSection; 2.40, ``Research facilities,''is most affected by the reassignment of responsibility. For example, proposedandSection; 2.40(e)(2) would have required the attending veterinarian toprovide consultation and guidance in areas of veterinary care. In the revisedrule, it is the research facility's responsibility to require and ensurethat the attending veterinarian performs those functions.<T3> General.</T3> Proposed andSection; 2.40 would require a written programof adequate veterinary care between a dealer, exhibitor, or research facility,and its attending veterinarian, which includes a program for disease controland prevention, pest and parasite control, pre- and post-procedural orsurgical care, nutrition, euthanasia, proper and appropriate use of anesthetics,analgesics, tranquilizers, and any other pain relieving drugs. We received comments addressing the nature of the program of adequateveterinary care generally, and the frequency of program review by the AreaVeterinarian in Charge that should be required when there is a part-timeas opposed to a full-time attending veterinarian. These areas of commenters'concern are clarified in the revised rule and are discussed below. We received 10 comments (8 from the research community and 2 from dealers)generally in favor of strengthening the current regulations concerningveterinary care and 35 comments (27 from dealers and 8 from exhibitors)generally opposed to strengthening the requirements. We have determined,based upon our experience, and for the reasons provided in the supplementaryinformation to the proposed rule, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, March 31, 1987, (<T3>see </T3>52 FR at 10303), that enhanced requirements for adequate veterinarycare are necessary to promote the health and well-being of animals. We received 329 comments (304 from the research community and 25 fromthe general public) expressing concern that the tone of proposed SubpartD is negative and will create a confrontational relationship between attendingveterinarians and research personnel and/or Committee members, rather thana cooperative relationship. We believe that the reorganization of andSection;andSection;2.30, 2.35, and 2.40 in the revised rule should allay this concern, becauseit resolves any disputes over areas of expertise and responsibility. Withthe reassignment of the areas of responsibility of the research facilities,Committee members, and attending veterinarians in this revised rule, webelieve the regulations will result in a synergistic relationship whichfosters animal welfare.<T3> Attending veterinarian.</T3> Proposed andSection; 2.40(a) would requireeach licensee or registrant to have an attending veterinarian who is ``accredited''by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in accordance with regulations issuedby the Secretary under the Act. The attending veterinarian would be responsiblefor providing adequate veterinary care to the animals in accordance withthe written program of adequate veterinary care required in proposed paragraphs(b) and (c) of andSection; 2.40. We received numerous comments from the research community addressing ``accreditation''of the attending veterinarian. Forty-six commenters from the research communityobjected that proposed andSection; 2.40(a) is unacceptable without the detailsof ``accreditation'' being included; 507 commenters (482 from the researchcommunity and 25 members of the general public) stated a more general concernthat the process for ``accrediting'' veterinarians was not explained inthe proposed rule. One hundred commenters from the research community statedthat APHIS is not in a position to establish professional qualificationsfor ``accreditation'' of attending veterinarians. As previously explained in this supplementary information, and under theheading, ``Attending veterinarian,'' in a related document, Part 1_``Definitionof Terms,'' published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, docket no. 88-013, we are removing referencesto ``accreditation'' from the regulations pending the Department's renamingand development of standards for the ``accreditation'' program. Proposedstandards will be published separately at a later date in a proposed rule.We believe that this action will satisfy the commenters' concerns.<T3> Program of adequate veterinary care.</T3> Proposed andSection; 2.40(b)would require the attending veterinarian to establish, maintain, and superviseprograms of disease control and prevention, pest and parasite control,pre- and post-procedural care, nutrition, euthanasia, and adequate veterinarycare for all animals on the premises of the dealer, exhibitor, or researchfacility. The programs must also include the proper and appropriate useof anesthetics, analgesics, tranquilizers, and euthanasia, when indicated.The reader should note that the requirement for a program of pre- and post-proceduralcare in proposed andSection; 2.40(b) applies to all research procedures andprocesses involving animals and is not limited to surgical procedures.Accordingly, we have revised all of the provisions of andSection; 2.40 inthis rule to refer to pre- and post-procedural care in place of pre- andpost-surgical care wherever it appears.In addition to the comments objecting to the allocation of responsibilitiesamong the facilities, the Committee, and the attending veterinarian, wealso received 64 comments from members of the research community statingthat the establishment, maintenance, and supervision of a program of adequateveterinary care in research facilities should be the responsibility ofthe Committee, and not the attending veterinarian. We do not agree thatthis responsibility should be imposed on the Committee. The Act does notrequire the Committee to develop a program of adequate veterinary care.Moreover, only one member of the Committee, the attending veterinarian,would be certain to have the requisite expertise to do so. As previouslyexplained under the discussion of Subpart C, we have determined that responsibilitiesnot imposed by the Act on the Committee should be placed on the facility.Establishment and maintenance of the program of adequate veterinary careis the responsibility of the facility, as provided in andSection; 2.30 ofthe revised rule. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 2.40(b) is revised tostate that responsibility for establishing and maintaining a program foradequate veterinary care is on the dealer, exhibitor, and research facility,instead of the attending veterinarian. The program would remain under thesupervision and control of the attending veterinarian, however, becauseof the attending veterinarian's expertise. We have also clarified paragraph(b), to provide that programs for disease control and prevention, pestand parasite control, pre- and post-procedural care, nutrition, the properand appropriate use of anesthetics, analgesics, tranquilizers, and euthanasiawhen indicated, are all elements of a program of adequate veterinary careand must be included by a dealer, exhibitor, and research facility in orderto have a comprehensive program as intended by the Act. Two commenters from the research community stated that the Department shouldpromulgate regulations on what constitutes an adequate program of veterinarycare. The elements that must be included in a program of adequate veterinarycare are provided in andSection; 2.40(b) of the revised rule. They are programsfor disease control and prevention, pest and parasite control, pre- andpost-procedural care, nutrition, euthanasia, and the appropriate use ofpain relieving drugs. It is the responsibility of the dealer, exhibitor,or research facility to ensure that its program of veterinary care adequatelycovers those areas. We are also revising andSection; 2.40(c) to require thatthese areas be included in the written program for adequate veterinarycare. In addition, andSection; 2.40(d) of this revised rule requires dailyobservation of each animal in order to administer properly the programof adequate veterinary care. The clarification of these paragraphs in therevised rule to specify the elements that comprise a program of adequateveterinary care should satisfy the commenters' concern. Three exhibitors commented that a responsible official of the dealer, exhibitor,and research facility should coordinate with the attending veterinarianin developing a program of adequate veterinary care. We believe that theconcerns raised by this comment have been addressed in the revised rule,which requires dealers, exhibitors, and research facilities to establishand maintain the program of veterinary care and requires the program tobe under the control and supervision of the attending veterinarian. Thesuggested coordination will result from this requirement, if properly implemented.We received 25 comments from members of the research community statingthat veterinarians are not trained for the role of determining what anesthesiaand analgesics to provide. We believe the attending veterinarian has thisexpertise and is best suited to provide guidance concerning the properuse of pain relieving drugs and the need for them. One commenter statedthat requiring the principal investigator to provide anesthesia and analgesicsin accordance with the attending veterinarian's recommendation places theattending veterinarian in the position of deciding critical experimentalissues, and this is not the role for which the attending veterinarian istrained. We disagree with the commenters. Under proposed andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(i),the attending veterinarian is required to provide consultation and guidanceto the principal investigator and to laboratory personnel during both planningand development of the ACUP and during the performance of the actual research.The principal investigator can consult with the attending veterinarianregarding the special needs and requirements of the research and experimentaldesign, and together they can resolve outstanding matters concerning theuse of pain relieving drugs. Additional review of determinations regardingthe use of drugs is provided under andSection; 2.35. Under that section,the ACUP must be reviewed and approved by the Committee, and the principalinvestigator must explain why an exception to the requirement to providefor the use of pain relieving drugs is justified. We do not believe thatthe attending veterinarian will be in the position of deciding criticalexperimental issues that are outside the scope of his or her expertiseor duties. We received 10 comments (3 from dealers and 7 from exhibitors) statingthat the attending veterinarian should not have to be present for routinehealth care procedures, such as vaccinations and worming. We agree withthe commenters. For this reason, there was no proposed requirement thatthe attending veterinarian be present at all times for those procedures,nor is there one in the revised rule. The requirement is that the programof adequate veterinary care, including the procedures involved in administeringa program of adequate veterinary care, be conducted under the supervisionand control of the attending veterinarian. This does not require the attendingveterinarian's presence at all times. No change is made in the revisedrule based upon this comment. Proposed andSection; 2.40(c) would require that a written program of adequateveterinary care between the dealer, exhibitor, or research facility andthe ``Doctor of Veterinary Medicine'' be drawn up and reviewed annuallyby APHIS. It would also require that the program provide for regularlyscheduled visits by the veterinarian as appropriate to the facility's needs,if a part-time or consulting veterinarian is the attending veterinarian.Each dealer, exhibitor, and research facility would be required to keepa copy of the program on file on the premises and to provide a copy tothe Area Veterinarian in Charge annually. Proposed paragraph (c) wouldalso provide minimum requirements that must be included in the writtenprogram of adequate veterinary care, in addition to the areas of care providedin paragraph (b). Six commenters from the research community stated that the term ``attendingveterinarian'' should appear in place of ``Doctor of Veterinary Medicine.''We agree and have made this change in the revised rule. We intended specificallythat the attending veterinarian, not any ``Doctor of Veterinary Medicine,''be involved in the development of the program of veterinary care. We haverevised paragraph (c) accordingly. We received 315 comments (290 from members of the research community and25 members of the general public) stating that the written program of adequateveterinary care required in proposed andSection; 2.40(c) reads like a contractbetween the facility and a part-time or consulting attending veterinarianand therefore would not be appropriate for full-time or staff attendingveterinarians. Representatives of HHS suggested that institutions witha full-time attending veterinarian on staff should not be required to prepareand submit annually for review a separate program document, since theywould have a program of adequate veterinary care in place through establishedpositions, lines of authority, and standard operating procedures. We agreein part with the HHS suggestion. We believe that if a dealer, exhibitor,or research facility has established a written program of adequate veterinarycare, separately or as part of its standard operating procedure, and hasa full-time attending veterinarian on staff, it need not annually prepareand submit to APHIS a separate document for the program of adequate veterinarycare. This is because the written program or SOP, coupled with the establishedlines of authority and responsibility, would address the requirement formaintaining a program of adequate veterinary care. We also agree that ifa dealer, exhibitor, or research facility has a written program of adequateveterinary care and a full-time attending veterinarian on staff, it issufficient if the written program of adequate veterinary care is reviewedby APHIS inspectors in the course of their regular duties, on the premises,rather than requiring the dealer, exhibitor, or research facility to redraftand submit a copy of their program annually to the Area Veterinarian inCharge, Dealers, exhibitors, and research facilities that have a full-timeattending veterinarian on staff generally are less likely to change theirattending veterinarian than are those with a part-time or consulting attendingveterinarian, and therefore changes to the program of adequate veterinarycare due to changes in personnel are less likely. Additionally, full-timestaff attending veterinarians can make daily personal observations or receivereports on animal conditions and care from employees under their supervision,and are in a position to respond promptly to veterinary care needs withtrained personnel. Part-time or consulting attending veterinarians wouldnot have the same opportunity to observe and to act.We are requiring in the revised rule that if a dealer, exhibitor, or researchfacility utilizes the services of a part-time or consulting attending veterinarian,it must provide the Area Veterinarian in Charge with its written programof adequate veterinary care, prepared and signed by its attending veterinarian,on an annual basis. We are requiring that a part-time or consulting attendingveterinarian prepare and sign the written program of adequate veterinarycare annually in order to verify that it is the current program of veterinarycare being implemented by the attending veterinarian and the dealer, exhibitor,or research facility. The dealer, exhibitor, or research facility mustalso keep a copy of the program on file at its premises at all times. Weare revising andSection; 2.40(c) in this rule to clarify these differencesfor dealers, exhibitors, or research facilities that have a full-time attendingveterinarian on staff and those that utilize the services of a part-timeor consulting attending veterinarian. They appear in paragraphs (c) (1)and (2) of andSection; 2.40 in the revised rule. Thirty-seven commenters (36 from the research community and 1 exhibitor)stated that the program of veterinary care should be reviewed every 3 years,instead of annually, to coincide with registration renewal. We are retainingthe requirement for annual review. The need for adequate veterinary carehas nothing to do with registration renewal every 3 years. Rather, it isconcerned with the daily health needs of the animals. The commenters donot mention the fact that the requirement for annual review of the programof veterinary care also applies to dealers and exhibitors We believe thatannual review is desirable in any event, because of changes in the technologyof veterinary care delivery, and changes in accepted procedures. Four dealers commented that visits by a part-time or consulting attendingveterinarian should not be required to be by appointment, but should onlybe required to be made on a routine basis. Proposed andSection; 2.40(c) requires``regularly scheduled visits appropriate to the facility's needs.'' Thereis no requirement for visits by appointment. Our concern is that visitsbe sufficiently frequent to provide adequate veterinary care, as ``appropriateto the facility's needs.'' No change is made to this provision in the revisedrule. We have made one additional change to proposed paragraph (c). In providingthe minimum requirements that must be included in the written program ofadequate veterinary care, we omitted reference to the areas of veterinarycare that must be included. These are the areas of veterinary care identifiedin andSection; 2.40(b) of both the proposed and the revised rules. This referenceis added as new paragraph (c)(3) and proposed paragraphs (c) (1) through(6) are redesignated as (c)(3) (i), (ii), and (iv) through (vii) in therevised rule. This change also responds to the 2 comments we received frommembers of the research community who stated that regulations should beprovided on what determines adequate veterinary care. <T3>Observation of animals and care for sick, diseased, injured, lame,or blind animals. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2.40(d) would require daily observationof animals by the dealer, exhibitor, veterinarian, animal caretaker incharge, or someone under their direct supervision. In drafting proposedandSection; 2.40(d), we inadvertently omitted research facilities from theentities required to observe each animal daily. We believe this subsectionwas understood to apply to research facilities since the second sentencerefers to animals obtained for research purposes. Also, proposed andSection;2.40(e)(2) imposes requirements on the attending veterinarian of a researchfacility in addition to those contained in paragraphs (a) through (d).The term ``research facility'' is added following ``exhibitor'' in therevised rule. The term ``veterinarian'' was intended to refer to an attendingveterinarian, and is modified in the revised rule accordingly. We received two comments from the research community stating that provisionshould also be included for observation of the animals by the principalinvestigator. We agree with this comment since the investigator is qualifiedto perform the required observation. The revised rule is changed to includeobservation by the investigator. One exhibitor and 1 member of the research community commented that therequirement for daily observation of the animals is excessive. One commenternoted that it is impractical to require the veterinarian of a large facility,such as large exhibition facilities or game farms, to observe each animaldaily, and that observation might actually be detrimental to the propermanagement of some species, such as bears isolated for cubbing. We disagreewith the commenter. The requirement for daily observation of most specieshas been part of the regulations since 1967 without resultant problems.It is also consistent with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of LaboratoryAnimals, which states that ``[a]nimals should be observed and cared forby qualified personnel every day, including weekends and holidays, * ** '' (p. 28). Daily observation is a necessary part of good husbandry practices.It is extremely important that this requirement be retained in order todetect possible problems, including detection of disease and abnormal behavior.Also, it is not necessary that one individual observe all the animals.The proposed regulation would require daily observation by ``the dealer,exhibitor, [research facility], [attending] veterinarian, [principal investigator],or animal caretaker in charge, or someone under their direct supervision.''(Bracketed terms are added to the regulation in the revised rule.) We areclarifying this provision in the revised rule to provide that someone underthe direct supervision of the attending veterinarian, principal investigator,or animal caretaker in charge would be allowed to perform the requiredobservation if he or she is required to report promptly his or her findingsto trained personnel and veterinary care is promptly provided. In thismanner, the need to provide necessary veterinary care will be promptlyidentified and communicated to responsible and trained personnel. We donot believe that objections to the requirement are valid. The requirementis retained in the revised rule. Proposed andSection; 2.40(d) would also require that ``each facility provideveterinary care or humanely dispose of sick, diseased, injured, lame, orblind animals, unless this would be inconsistent with the research purposesfor which the animal was obtained and is being held * * *.'' It would alsorequire compliance with any state or local law requiring holding of animalssuspected of being diseased for a specified period of time. We received 31 comments from the research community proposing that theterm ``unhealthy'' be substituted for ``sick, diseased, injured, lame orblind'' in proposed andSection; 2.40(d). We disagree with the commenterssince an animal can be lame or blind and still be considered ``healthy.''Substitution of ``unhealthy'' will not cover all of the conditions listedin the proposed regulation. The substance of the requirement, to provideveterinary care or to humanely dispose of animals that are ``sick, diseased,injured, lame, or blind,'' has been included in the regulations since 1967and has not presented any problems to our knowledge. Reference to ``sick,diseased, injured, lame, or blind,'' animals will remain in the revisedrule. We are revising the provision of the proposed rule requiring ``[t]hefacility'' to provide veterinary care or humanely dispose of sick, diseased,injured, lame, or blind animals. It is revised to clarify that this requirementapplies to all research facilities, dealers, and exhibitors. <T3>Research facilities. </T3>Proposed andSection; 2.40(e) would impose additionalrequirements on the attending veterinarian of a research facility. It wouldrequire the attending veterinarian to be a member of the InstitutionalAnimal Care and Use Committee and provide that he or she has ``authorityto enter all animal rooms, sites, facilities, and animal use areas, atany time.'' The requirements imposed on the attending veterinarian of a research facilityin the proposed rule include providing consultation and guidance to principalinvestigators and laboratory personnel during planning and developmentof an ACUP, and during actual research, whenever a procedure is likelyto produce pain or distress in an animal. Proposed paragraphs (A) through(D) of andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(i) identify specific areas in which the attendingveterinarian must provide consultation and guidance. Proposed andSection;2.40(e)(2)(ii) would require the attending veterinarian to establish arecordkeeping system and a standard operating procedure which indicatesand assures the proper use of drugs and proper pre- and post-surgical careon a daily basis. Proposed andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(iii) would require theattending veterinarian to sign an assurance statement on the research facility'sannual report, VS Form 18-23, certifying that he or she has authority toenter all animal areas, that he or she has carried out the requirementsof andSection; 2.40, and that he or she has read and understands the regulationsand standards contained in Parts 2 and 3 of the Animal Welfare regulations.In the revised rule, andSection; 2.40(e)(1), the research facility is directedto require that the attending veterinarian be a member of the Committee.Similarly, it is the research facility's responsibility, under andSection;2.40(e)(2)(i), to require the attending veterinarian to provide the requisiteconsultation and guidance. Also, as discussed in this supplementary informationunder the heading, ``Subpart B_Registration,'' only the chief executiveofficer or the institutional official with responsibility for animal carewill be required to sign the facility's annual report. This is consistentwith the PHS Policy. Accordingly, paragraph (iii) is deleted from andSection;2.40(e)(2) in the revised rule.Many of the comments we received addressing proposed andSection; 2.40(e)were from members of the research community. Therefore, unless otherwiseindicated, the source of the comments discussed in this section is theresearch community. Ten commenters stated that the word ``all'' should be deleted from paragraphs(e)(1) (``The attending veterinarian shall have * * * authority to enterall animals rooms, sites, facilities, and animal use areas, at any time''),(e)(2)(i)(D) (the attending veterinarian shall provide consultation andguidance in ``[e]valuation and approval of all animal surgical areas''),and (e)(2)(iii)(A) (attending veterinarian shall sign an assurance statementon the facility's annual report certifying that he or she has ``authorityto enter all animal areas''). Proposed andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(iii) is removedfrom the revised rule since the attending veterinarian is not requiredto sign the annual report. The other references to ``all'' remain as proposed,because we believe it is essential that all animal rooms and animal areasbe accessible to the attending veterinarian to assure proper and adequateveterinary care and to carry out the intent of the Act. The requirementsthat the attending veterinarian provide consultation and guidance in theareas of evaluation and approval of all animal surgical areas and qualificationsof personnel involved with animal surgery are ultimately the responsibilityof the facility and are included in andSection; 2.30 in the revised rule.The facility must assure, however, that evaluation and approval of allanimal surgical areas and qualifications of personnel are done in accordancewith instructions of the attending veterinarian. Accordingly, andSection;2.40(e)(2)(i)(D) of the revised rule retains the requirement that the researchfacility require the attending veterinarian to provide consultation andguidance with respect to evaluation and approval of all animal surgicalareas and qualifications of personnel involved with animal surgery. Fifteen commenters stated that the attending veterinarian should be allowedaccess to enter animal rooms, sites, facilities, and animal use areas only``at any reasonable time,'' rather than ``at any time'' as proposed inandSection; 2.40(e)(1). The commenters expressed concern that entry by theattending veterinarian in an animal study area during a procedure couldbe disruptive. We have determined that access ``at any time'' is imperativeto prevent obstruction by those principal investigators for whom thereis never a ``reasonable'' time to allow entry by the attending veterinarian.It is desirable that the attending veterinarian consult with the investigatorto determine what would be a reasonable time and that the attending veterinarianbe able to examine the ACUP in making this determination so as not to disruptprocedures or a controlled research environment. This may be done as partof the consultation and guidance provided during ACUP planning and development,and during actual research. Moreover, as previously discussed in the discussionof andSection; 2.30(b) under the heading, ``andSection; 2.30 Additional requirementsfor research facilities,'' research facilities could establish guidelinesin the facility's written policies and procedures to help reassure personnelthat this right of access would be exercised in good faith. It is important,however, that the attending veterinarian retain the right to have accessat any time to ensure compliance with the program of adequate veterinarycare, for the benefit of the animal. Forty-four commenters stated that the requirements imposed on the attendingveterinarian in proposed andSection; 2.40(e)(2) properly belong to the Committee.We do not agree. The Act requires that the principal investigator consultwith a doctor of veterinary medicine in the planning of any procedure likelyto produce pain or distress in an experimental animal (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(C)).The areas listed in proposed paragraphs (A) through (D) of andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(i)are necessary components of research planning and development and of veterinarycare. Proposed andSection; 2.40(e)(2) states that:<ITAG tagnum="21">In addition to the requirements set forth in paragraphs (a) through(d) of this section, the attending veterinarian of a research facilityshall: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) provide consultation and guidance to principal investigators andother laboratory personnel during protocol [ACUP] planning and development,and during actual research, whenever any procedure is likely to producepain or distress in an animal. Such consultation and guidance shall includeat least the following areas: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(A) the proper use of tranquilizers, analgesics, anesthetics, andeuthanasia according to the accepted, or common veterinary practice procedures;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) provision for adequate pre-surgical and post-surgical care bylaboratory workers in accordance with current established veterinary medicaland nursing procedures; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(C) agreement to the withholding of tranquilizers, anesthesia, analgesia,or euthanasia only when scientifically necessary and only for the necessaryperiod of time; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(D) evaluation and approval of all animal surgical areas and qualificationsof personnel involved with animal surgery. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) establish a recordkeeping system and standard operating procedure,which indicates and assures that the proper drugs are being used and thatproper pre-surgical and post-surgical care, are being carried out on adaily basis; \1\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Paragraph (iii) is not repeated here since the requirementfor the attending veterinarian to sign the annual report is removed fromthe revised rule. Forty-eight commenters stated that the areas provided in proposed paragraph(D) of andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(i) should be the responsibility of the researchfacility, not the attending veterinarian. We agree that the areas listedin proposed paragraph (D) of subsection (e)(2)(i) (evaluation and approvalof all animal surgical areas and qualifications of personnel involved withanimal surgery) as well as those listed in proposed paragraphs (e)(2)(i)(A)through (C) are ultimately the responsibility of the research facility.We believe, however, they should be carried out with consultation and guidancefrom the attending veterinarian and in accordance with his or her instructions,because the attending veterinarian is best qualified to advise in theseareas. Evaluation of animal surgical areas and the qualifications of personnelwill be accomplished through the attending veterinarian in the revisedrule, though they remain the ultimate responsibility of the facility. We received 506 comments (481 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) stating that proposed paragraph (e) of andSection;2.40 implied that the attending veterinarian would be required to be presentduring all actual research and that this is impractical and unnecessary.It is not our intent that the attending veterinarian must be present atall times during all actual research or during all actual research thatmight produce pain or  distress in an animal. Rather our intent is thatthe attending veterinarian must be available for consultation and to provideguidance, and must have free access to all animal areas if he or she determinesit is necessary to be present during the conduct of research procedures.During our consultations with representatives from HHS, they stated thatmany institutions interpreted proposed andSection; 2.40(e) as requiring theattending veterinarian's presence. They suggested the following clarifyingmodification to paragraph (e)(2)(i): ``Provide consultation and guidanceto principal investigators and other laboratory personnel during [ACUP]planning and development, and if deemed necessary by the IACUC [Committee]during actual research, whenever any procedure is likely to produce painor distress in an animal.'' We agree that the attending veterinarian shouldbe present during actual research that is likely to produce pain or distressin animals if requested by the Committee. We also believe the attendingveterinarian should be present if requested by the investigator, if complaintsfrom personnel or humane groups are received, or to observe the researchfor compliance with the approved ACUP, the facility's written policy underandSection; 2.30(e)(10), and the facility's program of adequate veterinarycare. The revised rule is modified to clarify that the attending veterinarian'spresence during actual research that is likely to produce pain or distressis required only under these circumstances. One commenter objected to the requirement in proposed andSection; 2.40(e)(2)(i)that the principal investigator consult with and receive guidance fromthe attending veterinarian during ACUP planning and development and duringactual research whenever a procedure would be likely to produce pain ordistress. Section 13(a)(3)(C)(i) of the Act specifically mandates thisconsultation in the planning of ``any practice which could cause pain toanimals.'' (7 U.S.C. 2143 (a)(3)(C)(i)). For this reason and for the reasonsstated above in our discussion of required consultation and guidance, nochange is made in the revised rule based upon this comment. We received 40 comments stating that the requirement of proposed andSection;2.40(e)(2)(ii), that the attending veterinarian establish a recordkeepingsystem to assure proper drug usage and proper pre- and post-surgical care,be deleted. Twenty-nine commenters noted that procedures for proper druguse and pre- and post-surgical care would be provided in the ACUP, makinga separate recordkeeping system unwarranted. We agree with the commentersinsofar as requiring assurance of proper care is the institution's responsibility.We believe that the research facility should have some means of verifyingthe elements of proper veterinary care and that their written program ofadequate veterinary care should provide for a recording system which indicatescompliance with proper veterinary care procedures. We have revised paragraph(ii) in this rule to reflect that research facilities are required to havetheir attending veterinarian establish, as part of the facility's programof adequate veterinary care, procedures and a recording system in theirprogram of adequate veterinary care which indicate and assure proper drugusage and proper pre- and post-procedural care. Four commenters stated that only the institutional official responsiblefor animal care should be required to sign the annual report, Form VS 18-23.We agree for the reasons set forth under the heading, ``Subpart B_Registration''and have removed paragraph (iii) from the revised rule. No other changes are made to andSection; 2.40 in the revised rule. <ITAG tagnum="81">Subpart E_Identification of Animals, Time and method of identification</ITAG> In proposed andSection; 2.50, we proposed animal identification requirementsintended to strengthen those of the existing regulations. We received 5comments (2 from dealers and 3 from the general public) generally endorsingthe stricter identification requirements and in favor of use of tags, tattoos,or both as the most reliable means of identification. One commenter urgedthat the type of marking provided in the regulations be by a humane method.Another commenter noted the need for requiring adequate recordkeeping asa means of verification of the animals' identity. We have reconsidered the proposed requirements in light of the commenters'concern for stricter identification requirements in general. We believethat the requirements contained in proposed andSection; 2.50 will resultin more animals held by all classes of dealers and by research facilitiesbeing properly identified by tagging or by an approved tattoo. In thisregard, we have reconsidered allowing class ``A'' dealers to identify livedogs or cats on the premises by ``an accurate and distinctive description,''a tattoo marking, or an official tag, and have determined that all animalson the premises should be identified by tattoo or official tag. We areeliminating the option to identify animals by description from proposedandSection; 2.50(a)(3) since it could result in inaccuracies or impropersubstitution of animals. With this method of identification removed fromthe regulations, we believe that the requirements in paragraph (a)(3) canbe combined with those of (a)(1). Accordingly, andSection; 2.50(a)(1) isrevised to require identification by tag or tattoo, of all live dogs andcats held on the premises, purchased, or otherwise acquired, sold, or otherwisedisposed of or removed from the premises. The commenter noting concern about humane methods of identification wasmost concerned that the method used not be unreasonably painful or distressful,such as ear tagging could be. The regulations are sufficiently clear intheir requirement that tags must be attached ``by means of a collar madeof material generally considered acceptable to pet owners'' and providesguidelines as to what would be considered acceptable and what would beunacceptable. Unacceptable materials are those such as wire, elastic, orsharp metal, that might cause discomfort or injury to the animals. Ear tagging is not an acceptable means of identification. We do not believethat additional regulations concerning the means of tagging are neededat this time. Although we did not receive any comments addressing proposed andSection;2.50(b), we wish to clarify that it requires identification of all livedogs or cats under a Class ``B'' dealer's control, or on his premises,and not just those that are purchased or otherwise acquired. The word,``or,'' was inadvertently omitted from paragraph (b) in the proposal. Tocorrect any misconception we are revising paragraph (b)(1) to read as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">When live dogs or cats are held, purchased, or otherwise acquired,they shall be immediately identified_</ITAG> We are making a conforming change in paragraph (c) for the same reason. We did not receive any other comments concerning the remaining sectionsof proposed Subpart E, however we have determined that some revision isnecessary. We have clarified proposed andSection; 2.50(e) by revising paragraph (e)(1)to include animals from any exempt source. Proposed paragraph (e)(2) istherefore removed from the revised rule because it is subsumed in paragraph(e)(1). We have revised proposed paragraph (e)(1) by redesignating itsprovisions as paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), and (e)(2) in the revised ruleto make it easier to follow. Paragraph (e)(1) of the proposed rule wouldprovide that all live dogs or cats delivered for transportation, transported,purchased or otherwise acquired, sold, or disposed of by a research facilitybe identified at the time of delivery, purchase, sale, disposal, or acquisitionby either: (1) An official tag or tattoo that was affixed to the animalat the time it was acquired by the research facility, or (2) a tag, tattoo,or collar applied to the dog or cat by the research facility which individuallyidentifies the dog or cat by description or number. The latter alternativeis redesignated as paragraph (e)(1)(ii) in the revised rule. We have determinedthat a tag, tattoo, or collar would identify the dog or cat by number only,and not by description, due to space and other practical limitations. Weare removing identification by description from this provision in the revisedrule. Subpart F_Stolen Animals Proposed andSection; 2.60 would provide that ``[a]ny person subject to theAct shall not buy, sell, exhibit, use for research, transport, or offerfor transportation, any stolen animal.'' One of the findings of Congresson which the Act is premised is that ``regulation of animals and activitiesas provided in [the] Act is necessary * * * in order (3) to protect theowners of animals from the theft of their animals by preventing the saleor use of animals which have been stolen.'' (7 U.S.C. 2131(b)). Section2.60 was proposed in order to prevent the buying and selling of stolenanimals and those obtained under questionable circumstances, since therequirements of marking for identification and recordkeeping have proveninsufficient to stop these practices. We received 377 comments (352 from the research community and 25 frommembers of the general public) stating that proposed andSection; 2.60 shouldeither be deleted from the regulations entirely or that it should be limitedto persons ``knowingly or willfully'' engaging in activities using stolenanimals. Fourteen commenters (2 from the research community and 12 frommembers of the general public) stated that they are in favor of the proposedregulation. As stated above, we have determined that this section is necessary andit remains in the rule, as revised. We have considered the comments statingthat the regulations should prohibit only willful or knowing use of stolenanimals and have determined that the resultant regulation would be ineffectiveand virtually unenforceable. We are concerned that persons seeking to usethe animals as provided in the regulation would choose to remain ignorantof the circumstances under which the animal was obtained. We have alsoconsidered adding an exception for circumstances in which the person holdingthe animal has made reasonable, good faith efforts to determine whetherthe animal was stolen or its origin. We have determined that the proposedregulation would be most effective in preventing theft of animals if thevarious activities involving stolen animals listed in the regulation constitutea <T3>per se </T3>violation of the regulations. Only in this manner can webe certain that persons subject to the Act will use best efforts in endeavoringto avoid using stolen animals. We are hopeful that the incidence of stolenanimals will subside if the market for them is eliminated. Section 2.60remains in the revised rule as originally proposed. Subpart G_Records<ITAG tagnum="81"> Dealers and exhibitors</ITAG> We received 5 comments (1 from the research community, 1 from an exhibitor,and 3 from the general public) noting the need for stricter recordkeepingrequirements in general. We believe that the additional recordkeeping requirementsproposed in Subpart G will assist the Department by enhancing traceabilityof the animals, which is one of the prime objectives of the recordkeepingrequirements, and will be a valuable tool in combatting the sale of animalsobtained unlawfully. We are clarifying andSection; 2.75 in this revised rule to reflect thatit applies to dealers other than operators of auction sales and brokers,and to exhibitors. This clarification is necessary because operators ofauction sales and brokers are dealers under the Act (7 U.S.C. 2131(f))and under the definition of ``dealer'' contained in Part 1_``Definitionof Terms'' (see companion docket no. 88-013, published elsewhere in thisissue), because they  negotiate the purchase or sale of animals, in commerce,for compensation or profit. Section 2.77 provides the recordkeeping requirementsapplicable to operators of auction sales and brokers to whom animals areconsigned. Proposed andSection; 2.75 would impose recordkeeping requirements upon dealersand exhibitors that are substantially similar to those required under currentandSection; 2.75, except that dealers and exhibitors would also be requiredto maintain in their records the vehicle license number and state, andthe driver's license number and state of anyone not licensed or registeredunder the Act from whom a dog or cat is acquired. This requirement wasnot included in proposed andSection; 2.75(b) and we have determined thatit is equally appropriate to include it for animals other than dogs andcats. This requirement was proposed to facilitate tracing the seller andthe source of the animals, particularly when the source or origin of theanimals is in question. Five commenters from the general public statedtheir approval of this requirement. One member of the general public suggested that we require owner releasestatements which acknowledge ownership of the animals whenever they areacquired or sold, or possession is otherwise transferred. We are concernedthat anyone who contrives to sell or transfer stolen animals would likelybe willing to provide a fraudulent owner release statement. Secondly, aperson subject to the Act might attempt to defend against a charge of violatingandSection; 2.60 by pleading good faith reliance on the owner release statementand could argue that it is not reasonable to require a person to go beyondobtaining the statement to satisfy themselves that the animals were notstolen. This would affect the Department's efforts to enforce andSection;2.60 of the regulations effectively under those circumstances or to prosecutepersons charged for activities involving stolen animals. Because of theseconcerns with the commenter's suggestion, we are not requiring an ownerrelease statement at this time. If we determine that it should be includedin some form in the regulations, we will publish a notice of proposed rulemakingand solicit public comments on the proposal.One exhibitor commented that APHIS, and not licensees, should maintaindealer records, such as the Record of Disposition of Dogs and Cats (VSForm 18-6). The Department is authorized under sections 10 and 12 of theAct to require that dealers and exhibitors maintain records with respectto the purchase, sale, transportation, identification, and previous ownershipof animals (7 U.S.C. 2140, 2142). The Department is also authorized undersections 10 and 12 of the Act to inspect and copy those records (7 U.S.C.2140, 2142). No change is made in the revised rule based upon this comment.Section 2.75 remains as originally proposed. Proposed 2.76 would similarly require research facilities to maintain intheir records the vehicle license number and state, and the driver's licensenumber and state of the person from whom a dog or cat was purchased orotherwise acquired if that person is not licensed or registered under theAct. Proposed andSection; 2.76 would also require research facilities tomaintain in their records the USDA license or registration number of thatperson if that person is licensed or registered under the Act. CurrentandSection; 2.76 is more general in its requirement that research facilitiesmaintain a license number if that person is licensed under the Act. The requirement to maintain the vehicle license number and state, and thedriver's license number and state of the person who owned or consignedthe animal(s) for sale was omitted from proposed andSection; 2.77(a). Wehave determined that it is equally appropriate to impose this requirementon dealers who are operators of auction sales and brokers, for the reasonsstated above. Accordingly, andSection; 2.77(a) is revised to include thisrequirement. We are also revising andSection; 2.77(a) in this rule to includethe date of birth or approximate age of the animal in the description required,because this requirement was inadvertently omitted from the proposed rule.We received 303 comments (278 from members of the research community and25 from members of the general public) stating that the requirement tomaintain a record of the USDA license or registration number is not inthe Act and that APHIS has failed to demonstrate how requiring it wouldbenefit animal welfare. Section 10 of the Act requires research facilitiesto make and retain records with respect to the purchase, sale, transportation,identification, and previous ownership of live dogs and cats, as the Secretarymay prescribe (7 U.S.C. 2140). Section 12 of the Act authorizes the Secretaryto promulgate recordkeeping requirements governing the purchase, handling,or sale of animals, in commerce, by research facilities (7 U.S.C. 2142).The requirement for maintaining a record of the USDA license or registrationnumber of the person from whom live dogs or cats are obtained allows theDepartment to trace the origin of the animals and thereby locate dealerswho may be suspected of selling unlawfully obtained animals. Without mechanismswhich enable the Department to locate persons selling stolen animals, theDepartment would be unable to fulfill one of the stated purposes of theAct, ``to protect the owners of animals from the theft of their animalsby preventing the sale or use of animals which have been stolen.'' (7 U.S.C.2131(b)(3)). Congress further authorized the Secretary ``to promulgatesuch rules, regulations, and orders as he may deem necessary in order toeffectuate the purposes of [the] Act.'' (7 U.S.C. 2151). The ability totrace persons selling animals is more important now than ever, becausefewer pound animals are being conditioned for research purposes and thedemand by the research facilities for experimental animals is increasing.There also appears to be increasing transfer of animals between researchfacilities, making it necessary to trace the sellers' identity throughmultiple previous owners. The requirement to obtain the license or registrationnumber of all persons from whom a research facility obtains dogs or catstherefore remains as initially proposed, as it is necessary and reasonableunder the circumstances. Three members of the general public commented that the regulations shouldbe revised to state that research facilities should buy animals from licensedsellers only. We believe that the Act fully covers this issue and thatfurther regulation is not necessary. Section 7 of the Act provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">It shall be unlawful for any research facility to purchase any dogor cat from any person except an operator of an auction sale subject tosection 12 of this Act or a person holding a valid license as a dealeror exhibitor issued by the Secretary pursuant to this Act unless such personis exempted from obtaining such license under section 3 of this Act. (7U.S.C. 2137).</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 2.1 was intended to better identify persons exempt fromthe licensing requirements of the Act, as discussed in the supplementaryinformation to Subpart A_Licensing, under the heading, ``Requirements andapplication.'' We do not agree that additional provisions need be includedin the regulations at this time No change is made in the revised rule asa result of this comment. <ITAG tagnum="81">Health certification and identification </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 2.79 would continue the requirement of current andSection;2.79 that a health certificate, executed and issued by a licensed veterinarian,must accompany any dog, cat, or nonhuman primate delivered by a dealer,research facility, exhibitor, operator of an auction sale, broker, or department,agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of any State or localgovernment, to an intermediate handler or carrier for transportation incommerce. It further provides that VS Form 18-1 may be used for healthcertification by a licensed veterinarian. VS Form 18-1 is the ``U.S. Interstateand International Certificate of Health Examination for Small Animals.''One commenter from the research community stated that federal institutionsthat are dealers are not required to sign Form 18-1. Nevertheless, theAct does require any ``department, agency, or instrumentality of the UnitedStates having laboratory animal facilities,'' to provide health certificates(7 U.S.C. 2144). Section 14 of the Act requires that they comply with paragraphs(a), (f), (g), and (h) of section 13 (7 U.S.C. 2143), and section 13(f)provides the requirement for a health certificate to accompany dogs, cats,and ``additional kinds or classes of animals designated by regulation ofthe Secretary.'' (7 U.S.C. 2144.) We intended to impose these prohibitions on persons who transport animalsin commerce themselves, rather than limiting the prohibitions to personswho deliver the animals to carriers or intermediate handlers, but inadvertentlydid not do so in the proposed rule. Imposing these prohibitions on personswho transport animals in commerce themselves is necessary because increasingnumbers of dealers, research facilities, and other persons are transportinganimals themselves, rather than using carriers and intermediate handlersto do so. The health and safety concerns underlying the minimum age requirementand health certification requirement apply equally to the animals in transport,regardless of the legal status of the person transporting the animal, andit is inconsistent with these concerns to place the prohibitions on carriersand intermediate handlers only. Therefore, andSection; 2.79 is revised in this rule by extending its prohibitionsto any dealer, research facility, operator of an auction sale, broker,or department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of anyState or local government transporting any dog, cat, or nonhuman primatein commerce. This would apply to federal agencies as well. We are similarlyextending the prohibition of andSection; 2.130 to any person transportingdogs or cats in commerce. We also note that in our proposal to amend Part 3_``Standards'' (see companiondocket no. 87-004, published elsewhere in this issue), we are proposingto make the transportation standards included in Subparts A-D applicableto any person subject to the Act who transports the regulated animals incommerce, rather than restricting the standards to carriers and intermediatehandlers as in the current regulations. Subpart H_Compliance with Standards and Holding Period <ITAG tagnum="81">Compliance with standards </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 2.100(a) would require the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">Each dealer, exhibitor, operator of an auction sale and research facilityshall comply in all respects with the regulations set forth in Part 2 andthe standards set forth in Part 3 of this subchapter for the humane handling,care, treatment, housing, and transportation of animals: Provided, however:That exceptions to the standards in Part 3 may be made for research facilitiesonly when such exceptions are specified in the research protocol; are explainedin detail in a report filed with the Institutional Animal Care and UseCommittee; and are approved by the Committee.</ITAG>Seven commenters objected to the wording of proposed andSection; 2.100(a).Four commenters from the research community objected to use of the term``research protocol'' in the proposed regulation. Three of those commentersand 2 additional commenters from the research community stated that thestatutory language should be used instead. A seventh commenter, also fromthe research community, stated that the phrase ``are explained in detailin a report filed with the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee;and are approved by the Committee'' should be removed from the regulation. We consider these comments to be unjustified. The proposed language istaken from the statute. Section 13(a)(3)(E) of the Act plainly states ``thatexception to such standards may be made only when specified by researchprotocol and that any such exception shall be detailed and explained ina report outlined under paragraph (7) and filed with the InstitutionalAnimal Committee.'' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(3)(E).) The term ``research protocol''is taken directly from the statute. However, as explained in Part 1_``Definitionof Terms,'' docket no. 88-013, published elsewhere in this issue of the<T4>Federal Register</T4>, we have replaced it with ``animal care and useprocedure'' (ACUP) everywhere it appears in proposed Parts 1 and 2. Thischange is to satisfy concerns voiced by members of the research communityand HHS that the Department would be interfering in research design. Therequirement that exceptions to the standards be detailed and explainedin a report to the Committee is also directly from the statute and remainsin the revised rule. We are revising andSection; 2.100 to also require thatexceptions from the provisions of andSection; 2.131, ``Handling,'' may bemade by research facilities when specified in the ACUP, explained in detailin a report filed with the Committee, and are approved by the Committee.This change is necessary because andSection; 2.131 pertains to the humanehandling of all animals covered by the Act and is derived from the standardsin Part 3. We have included it in Part 2 because all persons subject tothe Act must comply with it when handling all animals covered by the Act. Proposed andSection; 2.100(b) would apply to carriers and intermediate handlers,and would require that they comply with the regulations in Part 2 and thestandards in Part 3 pertaining only to the humane transportation of animalsin commerce. Proposed andSection; 2.100(a) would apply to dealers, exhibitors,operators of auctions sales, and research facilities, and would requirethat they comply with the regulations in Parts 2 and 3 in their entirety.We have determined that because intermediate handlers hold animals forseveral days while awaiting transportation in commerce, they should berequired to comply with all of the standards in Part 3 for the humane handling,care, treatment, and housing of animals during these holding periods, andnot just those pertaining to transportation. We are therefore revisingandSection; 2.100(a) in the final rule to include intermediate handlers andwe are removing them from andSection; 2.100(b) in the revised rule. Except for these three changes, andSection; 2.100 remains as proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81"> Holding period</ITAG>Proposed andSection; 2.101(a) would require a 5-day holding period for dogsand cats by dealers and exhibitors following their acquisition of the animal.One dealer objected to the 5-day holding period. Section 5 of the Act providesas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">No dealer or exhibitor shall sell or otherwise dispose of any dogor cat within a period of five business days after the acquisition of suchanimal or within such other period as may be specified by the Secretary* * * (7 U.S.C. 2135).</ITAG> Five days is considered to be the appropriate holding period under mostcircumstances We consider that this is a reasonable period of time to allowpersons to locate missing animals, and to enable a dealer or exhibitorto determine whether a dog or cat is fit for further transfer. Accordingly,the 5-day holding period remains in the revised rule. We are revising therule, however, to ensure that animals are held 5 full days. We are concernedthat if a dealer or exhibitor obtains an animal late in the day on a Monday,for example, that it could count that Monday as one business day and disposeof the animal early on Friday by counting Friday as one business day aswell. This would not allow owners sufficient time to locate their missinganimals. This problem would be compounded if the dealer or exhibitor isopen for business over the weekend and counts Saturday and Sunday as businessdays. Using the time of acquisition in the example set forth above, ananimal obtained late Thursday night might be disposed of first thing Mondaymorning, without allowing its owner a reasonable period of time to locatethe missing animal. To prevent this occurrence, we are revising andSection;2.101(a) to provide that, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (a),any live dog or cat acquired by a dealer or exhibitor must be held for5 full days, not including the day the animal was acquired. We are alsoproviding that the 10-day holding period applicable to live dogs or catsacquired by a dealer or exhibitor from any private or contract pound orshelter excludes the day the animal was acquired. We intended that all time periods provided in andSection; 2.101 would excludetime in transit. This exclusion was inadvertently omitted from the initialrequirement of paragraph (a) that ``[a]ny live dog or cat acquired by adealer \3\ or exhibitor shall be held by him, under his supervision andcontrol, for a period of not less than 5 business days after acquisitionof such animal.'' Reference to excluding time in transit has been includedin this revised rule, as well. We proposed certain exceptions to the 5-day holding period in andSection;2.101(a). The second exception stated in the proposed regulation wouldallow dealers or exhibitors who obtained dogs or cats obtained from governmentallyowned and operated pounds or shelters to hold the animals for only 24 hours,instead of the 5-day period otherwise required, if the animals completeda 5-day holding period at the governmentally owned and operated pound orshelter. We received 5 comments from members of the general public objecting tothe proposed exception for dealers and exhibitors who obtain dogs or catsfrom governmentally owned and operated pounds or shelters which would excusethem from the 5-day holding period. We agree with the commenters that thisexception should be removed from the regulations. Based upon our reviewof the comments, we have determined that a 1-day holding period would notprovide owners with a reasonable period of time to recover lost animalsthat have been placed in the pound or shelter, and that eliminating the5-day holding period for dogs and cats obtained from governmentally ownedand operated pounds or shelters would not be in the best interests of theanimals or their owners and would not be in keeping with the intent ofthe Act. Therefore, we are retaining the 5-day holding period in the finalrule for all dogs and cats obtained by a dealer or exhibitor, except asfollows: (1) In the revised rule we are requiring a 10-day holding period, notincluding the day of acquisition, for dogs and cats acquired or obtainedby a dealer or exhibitor from a private or contract animal shelter or pound.A holding period for animals obtained from a private or contract shelteror pound was not included in the proposal because proposed andSection; 2.132would have prohibited class ``B'' dealers from obtaining random sourcedogs or cats from those sources. Accordingly, it was not necessary to providea holding period. As explained below under the heading, ``andSection; 2.132Procurement of random source dogs and cats, dealers,'' the revised ruleprovides that class ``B'' dealers may obtain random source dogs and catsfrom private or contract pounds or shelters and must comply with the holdingperiod required under andSection;andSection; 2.101 and 2.132. We believe thata 10-day holding period for dogs and cats obtained from a private or contractpound is appropriate and reasonable because holding periods for these animalsare determined by local laws and vary greatly. Holding periods may noteven be required under some local laws. Moreover, animals held in privateor contract pounds often are from several different towns or counties,depending upon the contract arrangement, and the 10-day period will allowowners additional time to locate lost or stolen animals; (2) Dogs and cats that have completed a 5-day holding period with anotherdealer or exhibitor, or a 10-day holding period with another dealer orexhibitor if obtained from a private or contract shelter or pound, maybe sold or otherwise disposed of by subsequent dealers or exhibitors aftera 24-hour holding period;(3) Any dogs and cats suffering from disease, emaciation, or injury maybe destroyed by euthanasia before completing the requisite holding period;and (4) Any dogs and cats that are 120 days of age or less and that have beenobtained from the person that bred and raised the animal may be disposedof by dealers or exhibitors after a 24-hour holding period. The comments we received expressed concern that lost or stolen animalscould be sold to research facilities before their owners are able to locatethem. Proposed andSection; 2.101 provides holding periods for dogs and catsthat are applicable to dealers and exhibitors. One of the reasons for requiringholding periods is to allow owners of lost or stolen animals a reasonabletime to locate their animals before they are sold or otherwise disposedof by the dealer or exhibitor. We have determined that research facilities obtain dogs and cats from sourcesother than dealers and exhibitors which must comply with andSection; 2.101,and exempt sources. Some of these dogs and cats may be lost or stolen animals.We believe that an effective way to protect owners of lost or stolen animalswould be to impose a similar holding requirement on research facilitiesthat obtain dogs and cats from those other sources. Accordingly, we are requiring in this revised rule that research facilitiesthat obtain dogs and cats from sources other than dealers, exhibitors,and exempt persons must hold the animals for 5 full days, not includingthe day of acquisition, after acquiring the animal, excluding time in transit.Research facilities would still be subject to the identification of animalsrequirements in andSection; 2.50. We believe that this measure is necessaryto effectuate the purpose of the Act and that it is authorized under Section21 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2151). We are revising paragraph (b) of andSection; 2.101 to include reference toandSection; 2.131, ``Handling,'' for the reasons set forth above in thissupplementary information, under the heading, ``Holding period.'' <ITAG tagnum="81">Holding facility </ITAG>We are correcting a typographical error in proposed andSection; 2.102(a)(3).That paragraph incorrectly references andSection; 2.4. We have changed itin the revised rule to refer to andSection; 2.1, as we intended. Subpart I_Miscellaneous Section 2.125<ITAG tagnum="89">Information as to business </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 2.125 would require persons subject to the Act to provideto any Veterinary Services representative information concerning any businessof theirs which may be requested in connection with enforcement of theAct and the Animal Welfare regulations. The proposal differs from the currentregulation only in that carriers and intermediate handlers would also berequired to furnish business information upon the request of a VeterinaryServices representative. (Reference to ``Veterinary Services representative''is changed to ``APHIS official'' in the revised rule.) The current regulationonly applies to dealers, exhibitors, operators of auction sales, and researchfacilities. We received 16 comments from the research community stating that the proposalwould exceed our authority under the Act and that we have gone beyond theintent of the 1985 amendments to the Act. Another 4 commenters from theresearch community stated that proposed andSection; 2.125 should be deletedfor this reason. We believe these comments are unjustified, because therequirements contained in proposed andSection; 2.125 have been in effectsince 1967 with respect to dealers, exhibitors, and research facilities,and have not been subject to challenge. Nor have we encountered difficultyin obtaining compliance from the research community. Section 10 of theAct provides authority for requiring recordkeeping by dealers, exhibitors,and research facilities with respect to the ``purchase, sale, transportation,identification, and previous ownership'' of animals. Research facilitiesmust make and retain required records with respect to live dogs and catsonly. Authority to include carriers and intermediate handlers is specificallyprovided in Section 10 of the Act which further expressly requires that``[s]uch records shall be made available at all reasonable times for inspectionand copying by the Secretary.'' (7 U.S C 2140.) Section 12 of the Act authorizesthe Secretary to promulgate ``recordkeeping requirements governing thepurchase, handling, or sale of animals, in commerce, by dealers, researchfacilities, and exhibitors at auction sales and by the operators of suchauction sales.'' (7 U.S.C. 2142.) Section 21 authorizes the Secretary topromulgate regulations in order to effectuate the purposes of the Act (7U.S.C. 2151). The Department has determined that it is necessary to expandthe scope of current andSection; 2.125 to include carriers and intermediatehandlers because of their increased involvement in handling animals incommerce. Expanding the scope of this regulation is also necessary to enhanceenforcement efforts. We believe that ample authority is provided by theAct for requiring this information. We received 302 comments (277 from the research community and 25 from membersof the general public) objecting to proposed andSection; 2.125 on the basisthat the Act states that only those records required by the Act to be keptneed to be made available to APHIS. Current and proposed andSection; 2.125would require the furnishing of any information ``concerning the businessof the [persons subject to the act] which may be requested by such representative[of APHIS] in connection with the enforcement of the provisions of theAct, the regulations and the standards in this subchapter.'' In order tocarry out the Department's enforcement authority. Congress expressly authorizedthe Secretary to ``promulgate such rules, regulations, and orders as hemay deem necessary in order to effectuate the purposes of this Act.'' (7U.S.C. 2151.) Authority to require that business information that is pertinentto enforcing the provisions of the Act and the Animal Welfare regulationsbe provided to the Department upon request is necessary in order to carryout the intent of Congress. This authority must apply equally to all informationwhich may assist efforts to enforce the provisions of the Act and the regulations,but which is not specifically required to be kept by the Act, in orderfor the Department to be able to effectively enforce the regulations. We received 48 comments (46 from the research community, 1 from an exhibitor,1 from a member of the general public) suggesting we define ``proprietaryand business information'' and clarify proposed andSection; 2.125 to indicatethat APHIS cannot use it to obtain proprietary information. We do not agreethat these modifications are necessary. Current andSection; 2.125 has beenpart of the Animal Welfare regulations since 1967. There have been no complaintsthat it has been wrongfully used to obtain proprietary information. Theinformation required to be provided under the regulation is that whichpertains to the conduct of business by persons subject to the Act. Theinformation is necessary for the Department to effectively carry out itsregulatory and enforcement authority under the Act. For the above reasons no change is made to proposed andSection; 2.125 inthe revised rule. One commenter from the research community stated that we should clarifythe requirements for compliance by federal research facilities under proposedandSection; 2.125. Federal research facilities are not required to be registeredunder the Act; however, they are directed to comply with ``the standardsand other requirements promulgated by the Secretary for a research facilityunder section 13 (a), (f), (g), and (h).'' (7 U.S.C. 2144.) Except forthe information required in the annual report of research facilities, theywould not be required to furnish information to APHIS under andSection; 2.125.Section 2.126<ITAG tagnum="89">Access and inspection of records and property </ITAG>Proposed andSection; 2.126 would require dealers, exhibitors, research facilities,intermediate handlers, and carriers to provide access to Department representativesfor inspection of their premises, animals, and records, to copy records,and to take photographs to document conditions and/or areas of noncompliance.We received 193 comments from the research community stating that referenceto access to records and to taking photographs should either be deletedfrom the section or that the proposal should be revised to limit accessto records and photographing of the premises. We received 139 commentsfrom the research community stating that the entire section should be deletedor revised within the limits of the Department's statutory authority underthe Act. One commenter from the research community expressed concern thatphotographs could become available to the public through loss, theft, orFOIA requests. Statutory authority for Departmental access to conduct inspectionsof premises and records and to copy records is provided in Sections 10and 16 of the Act (7 U.S.C. 2140, 2146). Section 10 of the Act requirespersons subject to the Act to make and retain records as prescribed bythe Secretary and provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[s]uch records shall be made available at all reasonable times forinspection and copying by the Secretary.'' (7 U.S.C. 2140).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Section 16 provides that:<ITAG tagnum="21">[t]he Secretary shall make such investigations or inspections as hedeems necessary to determine whether [any person subject to the Act] hasviolated or is violating any provision of this Act or any regulation orstandards issued thereunder, and for such purposes, the Secretary shall,at all reasonable times, have access to the places of business and thefacilities, animals, and those records required to be kept pursuant tosection 10 of any such [person].''</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">It further requires that these inspections be conducted at least onceeach year and that follow-up inspections be conducted until all deficienciesor deviations are corrected (7 U.S.C. 2146(a)). The Department's authority to take photographs to document deficiencieshas been upheld in an unpublished decision by a United States Court ofAppeals following the Department's Judicial Officer's decision in <T3>In re: Donald Stumbo, d.b.a. Stumbo Farms, </T3>43 Agric. Dec. 1079(1984). We believe that andSection; 2.126 as proposed is within the Department'sauthority under the Act and that no revision is necessary. Two dealers commented that Department representatives should make appointmentsbefore conducting inspections. We disagree with the commenters. The Actprovides that the Secretary shall have access ``at all reasonable times''(7 U.S.C. 2146(a)) and that persons subject to the Act must make theirrecords available ``at all reasonable times for inspection and copyingby the Secretary.'' (7 U.S.C. 2140). We have found that the ability toconduct unannounced inspections enhances our enforcement efforts and isvital to encouraging actual and ongoing compliance with the Act. It isalso necessary for determining whether inspection findings are reliableindicators of the actual conduct of business by the inspected entity. Weare concerned that setting appointments would allow noncomplying personsto prepare for inspection, while operating at other times in noncompliance,because they feel secure they will not be inspected by the Department withoutwarning. For this reason, no change is made in the revised rule based uponthis comment. We received 6 comments (4 dealers and 2 exhibitors) stating that the propertysurrounding an animal facility should either not be subject to inspectionor that there should be a limit, such as 100 feet, on the surrounding areasubject to inspection. Department representatives will continue to inspectsurrounding land areas in order to detect problems with pests, odors, drainage,and trash or abandoned material, all of which can affect animal welfare.We agree that at some distance from a regulated person's permises, thecondition of the area no longer has any bearing on the welfare of animalson the premises. However, the distance would vary in every situation, dependingon the type of housing facility used, the area under the control of theregulated person, and other factors. Because these factors vary so widelyand so unpredictably, it is not practical for us to specify a limit inthe regulations. We received 6 comments (5 from members of the research community and 1dealer) stating that specific criteria should be established for the conductof inspections by APHIS inspectors. As stated in proposed andSection; 2.126,Department representatives will inspect facilities, property, records,and animals as considered necessary to enforce the provisions of the Actand the regulations and standards contained in Subchapter A_``Animal Welfare.''The standards contained in Part 3_``Standards,'' provide specific siterequirements which must be satisfied by persons subject to the Act holdinganimals. In a related document published elsewhere in this issue we areproposing standards applicable to dogs, cats, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits,and nonhuman primates. (<T3>See </T3>companion docket no. 87-004.) We believe that further specificationof criteria is not necessary at this time. We encourage comments concerningthe proposed standards, because they also contain criteria that will beused in conducting inspections. One member of the general public commented that the regulations shouldinclude inspection of humane societies, animal shelters, pounds, and thelike. These types of shelters are subject to regulation and inspectionif they sell animals for a regulated purpose, such as to research facilitiesor to dealers. Eleven commenters from the research community stated that federal facilitiesshould be subject to inspection by the Department. We do not have authorityunder the Act to inspect facilities operated by federal agencies; however,they must comply with section 13 (a), (f), (g), and (h) of the Act, andmust submit an annual report to APHIS each year. Accordingly, governmentowned and operated pounds are exempt from inspection by APHIS.Section 2.128<ITAG tagnum="89">Inspection for missing animals.</ITAG> Proposed andSection; 2.128 would require dealers, exhibitors, research facilities,carriers, and intermediate handlers to allow access by ``police or otherofficers of law enforcement agencies with general law enforcement authority(not those agencies whose duties are limited to enforcement of local animalregulations)'' to enter the premises to inspect animals and records forthe purpose of locating animals that are missing. Ten commenters from theresearch community stated that the section should be deleted from the regulations.One commenter stated that it violates the requirements of due process oflaw and the Fourth Amendment protection against unreasonable searches andseizures. The commenter stated that searches for missing animals shouldbe conducted under the existing procedures of local, state, and/or federallaw enforcement agencies.The Department is required by the Act to promulgate rules and regulationsrequiring persons subject to the Act to allow inspections to search formissing animals. Section 17 of the Act directs the Secretary to ``promulgaterules and regulations requiring [persons subject to the Act] to permitinspection of their animals and records at reasonable hours upon requestby legally constituted law enforcement agencies in search of lost animals.''(7 U.S.C. 2147). Under the proposed rule, the searches must be conductedin accordance with the conditions and limitations provided in paragraphs(a) and (b) of andSection; 2.128. Paragraph (a)(1) would require the lawofficer to furnish a written description of the missing animal, and thename and address of its owner before making the search. Accordingly, theremust be a reasonable basis to believe that the animal is on the premises.We believe that andSection; 2.128 does not violate any Constitutional rights.Cooperation to conduct these searches is required because the person holdinga missing or stolen animal may not have any intent to do so and may notbe aware that the animal has been stolen due to falsified shipping or purchaserecords. The regulations have required cooperation in searching for missinganimals since 1967 without incident or challenge and remains in the revisedrule. Six commenters from the research community stated that the section shouldbe clarified to include local animal regulations enforcement officers,humane association officers, and APHIS inspectors, and to extend the searchesto animals undergoing experimentation or research procedures. We are unwillingto make these changes because the Act and the legislative history are clearthat humane association and animal control officers are not authorizedto conduct searches for missing animals. The officers conducting the searchesmust have general law enforcement authority, as required by the Act. Furthermore,both the Act and the legislative history underlying it are clear that Congressdid not intend for the Department to interfere with the conduct of actualresearch (<T3>See </T3>H.R Report No. 1848 (August 11, 1966)). Nor did Congress intendfor private persons or groups to use this provision as a means of interferingwith research facilities by using it to gain entry. Concern that APHIS is not authorized to search for missing animals isinappropriate. APHIS inspectors are authorized to inspect animals and animalrecords in the course of a regular inspection or an inspection to determineif there is a violation of the Act or any of the regulations, includingandSection; 2.60. The searches identified in andSection; 2.128 are limitedto those conducted by law enforcement agencies and so there is no needfor mention of APHIS inspectors. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 2.128 remains as initially proposed.Section 2.129<ITAG tagnum="89">Confiscation and destruction of animals</ITAG> We received 1 comment from the research community objecting to the referenceto the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources(IUCN) in proposed andSection; 2.129(c) as inappropriate because the U.S.Department of Interior, Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is statutorilyauthorized to identify and list threatened and endangered species. Thecommenter also suggested identifying nonhuman primates as an endangeredspecies along with marine mammals. The commenter suggested that the Departmentshould consult with the appropriate government agency having statutoryauthority regarding importation or use of an endangered species, once aconfiscated animal has been identified as an endangered species. Proposed2.129(c) would direct the Administrator to consult with certain agenciesand the IUCN, when possible, before making any decision regarding destructionof a confiscated animal that is designated an endangered species.Proposed andSection; 2.129(c) concerns internal Agency procedure only andis not directed to any person subject to the Act and the regulations. Accordingly,we are removing it from the revised rule. Before making any decision regardingthe destruction of a confiscated animal that is an endangered species,however, the Administrator will, when possible, consult with representativesof FWS, the National Marine Fisheries Service, Department of Commerce,or other appropriate government agencies, and the IUCN. We did not receive any other comments concerning proposed andSection; 2.129.However, we are revising this section to clarify that any animal confiscatedunder this section, not just certain ones, may be placed with other licenseesor registrants which comply with the standards and regulations, and thatthe costs for this will be borne by the dealer, exhibitor, intermediatehandler, carrier, or research facility from whom the animals were confiscated.In order to make this clear, we are breaking proposed andSection; 2.129(b)into two portions, now designated as (b) and (c), and are making editorialchanges to the proposed requirements. We are also removing the separatereference to operators of auction sales from paragraph (a) because theyare dealers. Section 2.130<ITAG tagnum="89">Minimum age requirements </ITAG>We did not receive any comments concerning proposed andSection; 2.130. ProposedandSection; 2.130 would prohibit any person from delivering a dog or catto a carrier or intermediate handler for transportation in commerce unlessthe animal is at least 8 weeks of age and has been weaned. The only exceptionis for transportation in commerce to a registered research facility. Weinadvertently failed to include a prohibition which would prevent any personsubject to the Act from transporting a dog or cat in commerce by themselves,that is, without using a carrier or intermediate handler, unless the animalis at least 8 weeks of age and is weaned, except for transport in commerceto a research facility. We have included this prohibition in the revisedrule. Section 2.131<ITAG tagnum="89">Handling </ITAG>Sections 3.111 and 3.135 of Part 3_``Standards,'' Subparts E and F providehandling requirements for marine mammals and warmblooded animals otherthan dogs, cats, rabbits, hamsters, guinea pigs, and nonhuman primatesrespectively. Section 3.135 was included as part of Part 3, Subpart F,which was added when Congress amended the Act in 1970 to include all warmbloodedanimals used for research or exhibition purposes, or sold as pets. Section3.111 was added in 1979 when standards covering marine mammals were addedto Part 3. Subparts A through D do not contain comparable provisions. Asstated in the supplementary information accompanying the proposed rulefor Part 2, published March 31, 1987, 52 FR 10306, our experience has demonstratedthe necessity for handling regulations to protect the welfare of all animalscovered by the Act, and to enable the Department to better prosecute casesof inhumane handling and treatment. Accordingly, proposed andSection; 2.131would provide handling regulations applicable to all animals covered bythe Act. In this revised rule, andSection;andSection; 3.111 and 3.135 are removedfrom Part 3 and replaced with andSection; 2.131. Proposed andSection; 2.131(a) would require that:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a)(1) Handling of all animals shall be done as expeditiously andcarefully as possible in a manner that does not cause unneccessary discomfort,trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, or physicalharm. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Care shall be exercised to avoid harm to the handlers of suchanimals and to avoid unnecessary harm to the animals. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Physical abuse or deprivation of food or water shall not be usedto train, work, or otherwise handle animals.</ITAG>Two commenters from the research community stated that proposed andSection;2.131 should be deleted from the final rule. One of the commenters objectedthat the requirement to protect animals from ``unnecessary discomfort,trauma, overheating, excessive cooling, behavioral stress, or physicalharm'' is vague and that as proposed, a person subject to the Act wouldnot understand their responsibilities under the regulations. Another 108commenters from the research community objected to use of the term ``behavioralstress'' in proposed andSection; 2.131(a)(1). Proposed andSection; 2.131 contains language, including that which the commentersobjected to, that is substantially similar to the provisions of currentandSection;andSection; 3.111 and 3.135. Sections 3.111 and 3.135 have proveneffective in enforcement efforts. They provide in part as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Handling of animals shall be done as expeditiously and carefullyin a way so as not to cause unnecessary discomfort, behavioral stress,or physical harm to the animal. Care should be exercised also to avoidharm to the handler.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">We have not been presented with any legal challenges to this language.Our experience in enforcing these handling regulations has demonstratedthe need for similar regulations for all animals covered by the Act. TheAct requires that the Secretary promulgate minimum requirements to governthe humane handling of animals (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(1)), Section 2.131 thereforeremains in the revised rule. It should be noted that in accordance withandSection;andSection; 2.30(g) and 2.35(b)(3) of the revised rule, exceptionsto compliance with this regulation by a research facility in order to accomplisha research design must be explained in detail and justified by the ACUP,and must be approved by the Committee.We are removing proposed paragraph (a)(2) from the revised rule becauseAPHIS is charged with regulating the care of animals, not handlers, andbecause the requirement to exercise care to avoid unnecessary harm to theanimals is contained in paragraph (a)(1). Accordingly, proposed paragraph(a)(3) is redesignated (a)(2) in this revision of Part 2. We also received 99 comments (96 from members of the research communityand 3 from exhibitors) objecting to proposed paragraph (a)(3) which concernsphysical abuse and food and water deprivation, as unnecessarily restrictiveand stating that its terms should either be defined and clarified or deleted.One commenter from the research community stated that the institutionsshould have responsibility for monitoring food or water deprivation. Inthe course of our consultation with representatives of HHS, they expressedconcern that the proposed regulation was contrary to the Act's provisionthat the Act shall not be construed as ``authorizing the Secretary to promulgaterules, regulations, or orders with regard to the design, outlines, or guidelinesof actual research or experimentation by a research facility as determinedby such facility; * * * '' (7 U.S.C. 2143(a)(6)(A)). They stated that thewithholding of food and other experimental methods should be addressedby the investigator, reviewed by peers, and reviewed by the Committee.In response to the commenters, we again note that under andSection;andSection;2.30(g) and 2.35(b)(3), exceptions to compliance with this regulation bya research facility in order to accomplish a research design must be explainedin detail and justified by the ACUP, and must be approved by the Committee.However, our experience has demonstrated the necessity to maintain thisregulation prohibiting physical abuse or deprivation of food or water totrain, work, or otherwise handle animals. These have been common methodsof training animals in the past, as they are fast and simple and effective.But they can also be cruel and inhumane, and they are often unnecessaryas other methods can accomplish the same ends in time. Paragraph (a)(3)therefore remains in the revised rule as proposed, except for one clarifyingchange. We have added the words ``of animals'' following ``Physical abuse* * *.'' Paragraph (b) of proposed andSection; 2.131 would require as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(b)(1) Animals shall be exhibited only for periods of time and underconditions consistent with their good health and well-being. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) A responsible and knowledgeable uniformed employee or attendantmust be present at all times during periods of public contact. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) At a minimum, when dangerous animals such as lions, tigers, wolves,bears, or elephants are allowed to have contact with the public, the animalsmust be under the direct control and supervision of a knowledgeable andexperienced animal handler. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) If public feeding of animals is allowed, the food must be providedby the animal facility and shall be appropriate to the type of animal andits nutritional needs and diet.</ITAG>In addition to a comment from a member of the general public in supportof proposed paragraph (b)(2), we received 2 comments (1 from an exhibitorand 1 from a member of the research community) stating that the term ``uniformed''should be deleted from the paragraph. Our intent in requiring a uniformed employee or attendant to be presentat all times during periods of public contact was to ensure that the personresponsible for the animal and knowledgeable about it was readily identifiableto members of the public. It is necessary that the viewing public be ableto visually and readily determine who and where the attendant is at alltimes, both for the public's safety and for the safety of the animal. Asuniforms are not necessarily available, and other means can be used tomake an individual identifiable, we have replaced ``uniformed'' with theterm ``readily identifiable'' in the revised rule in response to the comments.Paragraph (c) of proposed andSection; 2.131 would require as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">(c)(1) During public exhibition, any animal must be handled so thereis minimal risk of harm to the animal and to the public, with sufficientdistance and/or barriers between the animal and the general viewing publicso as to assure safety to the animals and to the public. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Performing animals shall be allowed a rest period between performancesat least equal to the time for one performance. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Young or immature animals shall not be exposed to rough or excessivepublic handling or exhibited for periods of time which would be detrimentalto their health or well-being. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Drugs, such as tranquilizers, shall not be used to facilitate,allow, or provide for public handling of the animals.</ITAG>One member of the general public commented that the rest period that wouldbe required under proposed paragraph (c)(2) should be extended to 3 timesthe performance time rather than a period of time equal to the performancetime. Current andSection;andSection; 3.111 and 3.135 require a rest periodequal to the performance time. Experience with this requirement has demonstratedthat it provides an adequate rest period. We are not aware of any negativebehavior by performing animals or problems with the animals as a resultof this length rest period. No change is made in proposed paragraph (c)(2)in the revised rule. One member of the general public commented that dangerous animals shouldnot be allowed contact with the public. The regulations in proposed paragraphs(b) and (c) of andSection; 2.131 do not create a right of exhibitors to allowcontact between wild or dangerous animals and the public. Proposed andSection;2.131(c) would require that in order to publicly exhibit an animal, anexhibitor must handle animals so that there is minimal risk of harm tothe public. Proposed andSection; 2.131(b) sets forth the conditions thatapply to public exhibition of an animal if, and only if, handling an animalso that there is minimal risk of harm to the public would allow publicexhibition. We are reversing the order of proposed paragraphs (b) and (c)in the revised rule in order to make clear that exhibitors do not havea right to allow contact between the public and dangerous animals. Section 2.132<ITAG tagnum="89">Procurement of random source dogs and cats, dealers </ITAG>In order to carry out the intent of Congress and to ``protect the ownersof animals from the theft of their animals by preventing the sale or useof animals which have been stolen'' (7 U.S.C. 2131(b)(3)), we proposedto limit the sources from which class ``B'' dealers can acquire live randomsource dogs and cats. We proposed to limit those sources to State, county,or city owned and operated pounds or shelters. Under the proposed regulation,class ``B'' dealers would not be able to obtain random source dogs andcats from nongovernment pounds or shelters or from individuals who didnot breed and raise the dogs and cats on their own premises. Nonrandomsource dogs and cats could be obtained from persons who bred and raisedthe dogs and cats on their own premises. One intended effect of the proposed regulation was to prevent the saleof random source dogs and cats to dealers at flea markets, auctions, andtrade-day type sales. Our objective was to prevent the theft of animalsfor purposes of selling them to dealers who in turn would sell the stolenanimals to research facilities.Another intended effect of the proposed regulation was to eliminate theindiscriminate impoundment of ``lost'' animals by contract pound operatorswho are also licensed dealers. In the past several years, we have learnedof increasing numbers of complaints and allegations that contract privateanimal pounds that are also licensed dealers under the Act have been overzealousin impounding dogs and cats. There are allegations that the impounded dogsand cats are not always stray or lost animals. In addition, the Agencyhas become aware of several instances where licensed dealers obtained stolendogs and cats, or obtained dogs and cats under false pretenses or misrepresentation.We proposed in andSection; 2.132, to prohibit dealers from obtaining liverandom source dogs and cats from private or contract pounds or shelters,or from individuals who did not breed and raise the dogs and cats on theirown premises. The proposed regulation would prevent operators of contractor private pounds or shelters from operating as class ``B'' dealers andselling their animals to research facilities. Our objective again was toprevent pound operators from obtaining dogs and cats from questionablesources, holding them for a short period, and then selling them to researchfacilities. We also intended to prevent pound operator-dealers from interminglingthe animals and selling those dogs and cats that must be held by the poundoperator for the requisite holding period pending identification and returnto their owner, with those that have completed the requisite holding periodand may be sold to research facilities or otherwise disposed of. The proposedregulation would also have the effect of preventing class ``B'' dealersfrom obtaining random source dogs and cats from other dealers for resale.We received 2,865 comments from members of the general public supportingthe proposed limitation of sources from which class ``B'' dealers can obtainrandom source dogs and cats. We also received 21 comments from membersof the research community and 3 comments from dealers expressing supportfor proposed andSection; 2.132. We also received 167 comments from members of the research community objectingto the proposed regulation on the grounds that it exceeds our statutoryauthority, would limit the availability of animals for use by researchfacilities, and/or would increase the cost of animals to research facilities.We believe that objections to the proposed regulation stating that it exceedsour statutory authority are incorrect. As expressed above and in the supplementaryinformation to the proposal, preventing the theft of dogs and cats forthe purpose of selling them to research facilities was one of the principalconcerns prompting enactment of the Animal Welfare Act. To effectuate thispurpose, the revised rule provides a number of measures, such as the recordsrequired by andSection;andSection; 2.75 and 2.76 and the prohibition containedin andSection; 2.60 against buying, selling, or using stolen animals, whichwere designed to prevent the sale of stolen animals and accordingly discouragethe practice of stealing animals for sale to research facilities. Section21 of the Act authorizes the Secretary to ``promulgate such rules, regulations,and orders as he may deem necessary in order to effectuate the purposesof [the] Act.'' (7 U.S.C. 2151). The statutory authority for proposed andSection;2.132 is clear. We have considered those comments which stated that preventing the saleof dogs and cats obtained from private or contract pounds or shelters wouldcut off a legitimate and valuable source of research animals and woulddrastically increase the cost of available animals. We understand thatresearch facilities need a continuing source of dogs and cats for research.It was not our intent to reduce the available supply of dogs and cats forresearch purposes, but instead to exert better control over the sourceof dogs and cats for dealers. To accommodate the need for a supply of research animals and to ensurethat those animals are legally acquired by dealers for sale to researchfacilities, we are revising andSection; 2.132 as follows: We are removingthe prohibition against the purchase and sale of random source dogs andcats by dealers. We will allow dogs and cats from private or contract animalpounds to be obtained and sold by dealers and registrants, but with certainrestrictions in order to better ascertain how, where, from whom, and whenthe dogs and cats were obtained by the pound, and when they were sold tothe dealer. Any licensee or registrant who also operates a private or contractpound or shelter must maintain two physically separate and distinct animalfacilities, one for the pound or shelter and one for the dealer or registeredfacility. The dealer or registrant must also maintain separate and accuraterecords at each facility. Dealers must comply with the 10-day holding periodrequired in andSection; 2.101, regardless of whether the dog or cat was obtainedfrom a contract pound or shelter operated by the dealer or registrant,or from another contract pound or shelter. Any licensee or registrant under the Act who also operates a private orcontract pound or shelter must maintain records in accordance with andSection;andSection;2.75 and 2.76 for live nonrandom source dogs and cats. Because the informationrequired by andSection;andSection; 2.75 and 2.76 is not available for lostor stray animals, the following information is required to be maintainedby the pound or shelter for lost or stray dogs and cats: (1) An accuratedescription of the dog or cat; (2) how, where, from whom, and when thedog or cat was obtained; (3) how long the dog or cat was held by the poundor shelter before being transferred to the dealer operation; and (4) thedate the dog or cat was transferred to the dealer operation. The informationmust be maintained in separate records, at both the pound or shelter andat the licensed or registered operation. We believe that these restrictions and recordkeeping requirements willresult in reducing the ease and temptation of transferring impounded animalsto the dealer operation before any required holding period has been completedat the pound or shelter. They should also make it easier to trace the sourceof an animal in order to locate a missing dog or cat. We also believe thatthey will assist the Agency in our efforts to protect the owners of lostor stolen animals. These restrictions and recordkeeping requirements willprovide us with adequate controls on the sale and movement of dogs andcats and will allow this resource to continue to be utilized as a sourceof research animals. We are also revising andSection; 2.132 to clarify that live nonrandom sourcedogs and cats may be obtained from hobby breeders, because the animalswould have been bred and raised on the individual's premises. We are including an express prohibition against any person subject to theAct obtaining random source dogs or cats by use of false pretenses, misrepresentation,or deception, as an additional safeguard against dealers using their otherstatus as a pound or shelter to obtain dogs and cats and immediately transferringthe animal to the dealer operation for sale to a research facility. Thisis also intended to prevent them from obtaining animals by claiming theywill give it a ``good home'' and then selling it for research purposes.We received 1 comment from a member of the research community stating thatthe regulations should allow dogs and cats held in government operatedshelters to be available if they have been held for a 7-day period andthere is public notice. This was not addressed in the regulations as theholding period at government pounds and the sale of animals held thereis governed by local law. No change is made based upon this comment.<ITAG tagnum="84"> Statutory Authority</ITAG> This rule is issued pursuant to the Animal Welfare Act (Act), as amended,7 U.S.C. 2131-2157. Congress recently added significantly to the Secretary'sresponsibilities under the Act, particularly with regard to the use ofanimals by research facilities, in the Food Security Act of 1985, Pub.L. No. 99-198, approved December 23, 1985. The declared policy of the Actis to ensure that animals intended for use in research facilities, as pets,or for exhibition purposes, are provided humane care and treatment; toassure the humane treatment of animals during transportation; and to preventthe sale of stolen animals. The Act requires that animal dealers and exhibitors obtain a license fromthe Secretary, and that research facilities, carriers, and intermediatehandlers register with the Secretary. The Act directs the Secretary toissue specific regulations concerning, inter alia, recordkeeping, veterinarycare, handling, transportation, identification of animals, and holdingperiod requirements. In addition, the 1985 amendments require the Secretaryto issue expanded regulations governing the use of animals in researchfacilities. Section 21 of the Act continues to authorize the Secretaryto issue such regulations as he deems necessary to effectuate the purposesof the Act. The recent amendments mandate that these regulations are to include standardsfor care, treatment, and practices in experimental procedures which willminimize pain and distress. The Secretary is to require that researchersconsider alternatives to painful procedures and that, with regard to painfulprocedures, researchers must consult a veterinarian; use adequate tranquilizers,anesthetics, and analgesics; and provide for adequate pre- and post-surgicalcare. Moreover, exceptions to these standards may be made only when specifiedby research protocol and explained in a report mandated in the Act. The Act also mandates that the Secretary issue regulations requiring researchfacilities to show and report that they are complying with the Act andthat they are following professionally acceptable standards in the careand treatment of animals during research. The Act directs the Secretaryto require each research facility to establish a committee to assess thefacility's use and treatment of animals. The Act specifies the compositionof the committee, including the requirement that each committee must becomposed of at least three members and that each committee must have atleast one member who is a veterinarian and at least one who representsthe community interest in proper animal care. The Act mandates many ofthe committee's responsibilities, including that it inspect and reportat least semi-annually on the condition and use of animals and report anyviolations of the standards. The Secretary is also to require each researchfacility to provide training for all personnel involved in animal care. This rule contains regulations required by the 1985 amendments as wellas modifications to existing regulations based on the Department's experiencein administering the Act.<ITAG tagnum="84"> Executive Order 12291 </ITAG> On March 31, 1987, the Department published proposed rules to amend Part1_``Definition of Terms'' and Part 2_``Regulations,'' of the Animal Welfareregulations (52 FR 10292, 10298) in order to implement the 1985 amendmentsto the Animal Welfare Act, Pub. L. 99-198, the ``Food Security Act.'' Theproposed action was reviewed pursuant to Executive Order 12291 and it wasdetermined that it did not constitute a ``major rule.'' We solicited commentswith regard to the proposed rules, and have made modifications to thoserules as explained in the ``Supplementary Information.'' At this time,we are also publishing a proposal to revise the standards contained in9 CFR Part 3_``Standards,'' published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. In revising Parts 1 and 2, and in preparing the proposed rule for Part3, we assessed the economic effects of the regulations in accordance withthe requirements of Executive Order 12291. We considered alternative approachesto carrying out our statutory mandate, many of which we adopted. A regulatoryimpact analysis of revised Parts 1 and 2, and the proposal for Part 3 wasprepared. Based on that analysis, which included consideration of bothquantifiable and nonquantifiable effects of the rules, the Administratorhas determined that Parts 1 and 2 would have an impact on the economy inexcess of $100 million annually, and would constitute a ``major rule.'' The following requirements under Parts 1 and 2 represent some of the majorcosts to the regulated industries: (1) The establishment and responsibilitiesof the animal care and use committees; (2) aseptic surgical facilitiesand adequate pre- and post-procedural care; (3) increased responsibilitiesfor attending veterinarians; (4) additional administrative responsibilities;(5) increases in license fees; and (6) identification for dogs and catsless than 16 weeks of age. The economic impacts of these rules are discussed in more detail in aregulatory impact analysis, which is available for public inspection inRoom 1141 of the South Building, U.S. Department of Agriculture between8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday, except holidays (addressabove). Main findings of this analysis are summarized below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,xs68 </C><T4> Summary of Regulatory Impact Analysis  </T4><H1>Costs </H1><H1>Benefits </H1>  Direct <D>Direct</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Regulated industry <D>Increased public satisfaction from improved animal welfare*</D></ITAG>Capital expenditure:<ITAG tagnum="2">(All parts) $876 million <D>Improved research information* </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(Parts 1-2) $142 million <D>Productivity gains for regulated industries*</D></ITAG>Annual costs:<ITAG tagnum="2">(All parts) $207 million</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">(Parts 1-2) $126 million</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">APHIS program costs $2 million</ITAG>Impact on Federal sites* Indirect <D>Indirect </D><ITAG tagnum="1">Opportunity costs for users of biomedical research (goods and service),pet industry, and animal exhibits*<D>Market effects for suppliers of animal husbandry products* </D><P>Non-market effects*  </P></ITAG>Increased Federal financial support for biomedical community* Non-market effects*  <F>* Not quantified.</F></ITAG> Compliance with more stringent federal regulations on the humane careand treatment of animals used for research, testing, teaching, exhibition,and business ventures would result in major direct and indirect effectsimposed on the regulated industries and the general economy. An examinationof the estimated cost impacts indicates that the amended regulations constitutea ``major rule'' based on annual effects in excess of $100 million on theeconomy and large cost increases on regulated industries for animal usesand maintenance, in particular to the biomedical research community. However,this study could not properly assess the relative significance of thesecost increases on the regulated industry or the presence of adverse effectson competition innovation, and the ability of domestic enterprises to competewith foreign enterprises in international markets. Regulated persons or establishments will be required to spend approximately$876 million in capital expenditures over the next two or three years.Of this amount approximately 16 percent is attributable to Parts 1 and2. If Parts 1 and 2 were enforced separately, regulated research facilitieswill be required to spend approximately $142 million to renovate, equip,replace, or construct aseptic surgical facilities, and provide for adequatepre- and post-surgical care. Capital expenditures attributable to Part3 include costs for renovation, equipment replacement, and new constructionof animal housing facility space. Capital expenditures to improve animalhousing facilities would result from the new minimum standards for generalenvironmental conditions, space or primary enclosure size requirements,exercise of dogs, and enrichment of nonhuman primate enclosures. In addition to capital expenditures, total annual operating expendituresestimated at $207 million will also be required. Approximately 60 percentof this total ($126 million) is accounted for by Parts 1 and 2, primarilythe requirements for the establishment and operations of the institutionalanimal care and use committees, additional responsibilities for attendingveterinarians, and record-keeping requirements. Annual expenditures attributableto Part 3 would result from the need for additional personnel (animal handlers)to exercise dogs, and the daily maintenance of animal housing facilities.An important result of this regulatory analysis is that policy decisionsmust consider other direct and indirect effects associated with the promulgationand enforcement of federal rules. Increased federal legislation causesimportant economic benefits and costs which are unevenly distributed amongregistrants and licensees. Direct benefits accrue to society by knowingthat animals may be better cared for and treated humanely. The value ofthese social benefits are subject to personal preferences and concerns.Improvements in the well-being of regulated animals may also provide gainsin productivity to the industry. On the other hand, increased costs ofcompliance will be passed from the regulated industry to consumers whopurchase their goods and services. For example, the field of biomedicalresearch and education depends heavily on the use of animals to conducttests and experiments. Increased costs for animal uses have broader economicand health implications for all of us. Study results do not suggest thatthese regulations would cause establishments to abandon the use of animalssince current biomedical research outlays are in excess of $12.8 billionper year. Nonethelsss, there could be important effects associated withallocating additional funds or expenditures to comply with the amendedanimal welfare regulations. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>As part of the regulatory impact analysis performed by the Department wehave analyzed the potential impact on small entities of Parts 1 and 2,as revised, and the proposal to amend Part 3 of the Animal Welfare regulations,as required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). Based upon our analysis, we have determined that Parts1 and 2 of the regulations would affect all regulated small entities, primarilyby increases in annual license fees and identification requirements fordogs and cats. However, these economic impacts would not be significant.It is anticipated that the largest impact on small entities would resultfrom Part 3_``Standards'', if it is implemented as proposed. Under thesecircumstances the Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService has determined that this action would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372 </ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372,which requires intergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.(See 7 CFR 3015, Subpart V.) <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG>In accordance with section 3507 of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(44 U.S.C.
