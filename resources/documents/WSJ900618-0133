But littleattention has been paid to how the proposed amendment wouldwork.   At first glance, the amendment appears straightforward.&quot;The Congress and the states shall have power to prohibit thephysical desecration of the flag of the United States,&quot; readsthe text proposed in both the House and Senate and favored byPresident Bush.</LP><TEXT>   But some constitutional law experts say that the wordingof the proposal, far from being straightforward, is ambiguousand will lead to considerable uncertainty. &quot;The proposalcreates a constitutional black hole,&quot; says Walter Dellinger,a Duke University Law School professor and an opponent of anyflag amendment.   The Supreme Court found that both the Texas flag law itstruck down last year and the federal law it invalidated lastweek violated the First Amendment guarantee of freedom ofspeech. Logically, then, a constitutional amendment toprotect the flag would have to modify the First Amendment.   But the proposed amendment doesn't say what it wouldmodify, notes William Van Alstyne, also a Duke University LawSchool professor. There is nothing in the proposal &quot;thatsuggests the First Amendment is to be deemed no longerapplicable to any state or national law providing penaltiesfor what the government may regard as the physicaldesecration . . . of the flag,&quot; he says.   Because the proposed amendment doesn't make clear itseffect on the First Amendment, Mr. Van Alstyne says, it ispossible that even if it is adopted the Supreme Court mightstill find the Texas flag law unconstitutional under theFirst Amendment when it is used to prosecute those who burnthe flag as a political protest.   Mr. Van Alstyne argues that it is no accident that theproposal doesn't mention the First Amendment directly. Anamendment that squarely removed &quot;one particular kind ofsymbolic expression&quot; from the protection of the FirstAmendment, he says, &quot;would be unseemly&quot; and &quot;would embarrassus.&quot;   Mr. Dellinger says the proposal must be intended to alterthe First Amendment, because Congress and the states alreadyhave the power to protect the flag in situations to which theFirst Amendment doesn't apply. For example, the Supreme Courtsuggested last week that Congress and the states still may befree to protect publicly owned flags, and that Congress alsomay be able to prohibit commercial exploitation of the flag.   But Mr. Dellinger raises other concerns. The Supreme Courthas long held that laws restricting speech or other forms ofexpression protected by the First Amendment areunconstitutional if they are too vague or too broad. If 50states and even more local governments pass new flag laws,will they be subject to vagueness and overbreadth rulings, orwill they be exempt?   And, he asks, what of the Eighth Amendment limits oncriminal sentences that are &quot;cruel and unusual punishment?&quot;Are they applicable to new flag laws, or will they be sweptaside by the proposed amendment?   Mr. Dellinger also notes that state and local governmentsmay define &quot;physical desecration&quot; in disparate ways. A cityor state could choose to include the waving of the flag atpolitical rallies or conventions as a form of physicaldesecration, he says.   Besides these uncertainties, there is another wild card inthe flag debate. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman JosephBiden, a Delaware Democrat, is drafting his own amendment,which is intended to be less ambiguous than the one backed bythe administration.   Moreover, congressional aides who are familiar with theeffort say Sen. Biden plans an approach like Prohibition,which was established by the 18th Amendment. Aides say theBiden amendment would prohibit desecration of the flag butwould say that Congress alone may pass laws to enforce it.   Sen. Biden has scheduled a hearing for Thursday on theflag, but he isn't expected to reveal his proposal then. Oneproblem he faces, according to congressional aides, is thathe can't find constitutional law experts to testify in favorof his plan.</TEXT></DOC>
