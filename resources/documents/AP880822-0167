The illegal strikes raised a ``specter of anarchy'' over Polandand were a ``glaring violation of peace and order,'' said InteriorMinister Czeslaw Kiszczak.   The army general, appearing in uniform on national television,said it was the duty of Poland's leaders not to allow the countryto return to ``the situation before Dec. 13, 1981'' _ the date thatmartial law was imposed to suppress the outlawed trade unionfederation Solidarity.   Kiszczak, also commander of the nation's police forces, said itwas his duty as interior minister to ``assure elementarydiscipline.''   Even before he spoke, strike organizers said riot police stormedtwo strikebound streetcar depots in Szczecin and a bus depot nearthe city, evicting the workers and detaining at least 150 of themin the first police action in the week of labor unrest.   In addition to authorizing curfews in the provinces of Szczecin,Katowice and Gdansk, Kiszczak said he ordered law enforcementforces ``to strengthen external protection'' around factories andto prevent outsiders from being present in the plants.   Kiszczak said the army was asked to allot troops to ``assure thecontinuity of city transport everywhere it has been immobilized,''and misdemeanor courts were advised to jail violators in summaryproceedings rather than merely fining them.   Katowice is the southern province where miners in Poland'sSilesian coal fields have been striking for a week for higher payand recognition of Solidarity. Hundreds of workers at the Leninshipyard in Gdansk _ the birthplace of Solidarity _ joined thestrikes Monday, seizing the main gate of the facility, chanting thename of the banned union and waving Polish flags.   Kiszczak said the strikes were being carried out by only aminority of workers at the affected plants, but had direconsequences for the economy.   Sit-in strikes were in effect Monday in 13 state enterprisesemploying more than 90,000 workers.   ``Depending on further developments of the situation we shallreach for appropriate measures which are available within theexisting law,'' Kiszczak said, speaking in deliberate tones forbetween five and 10 minutes, and making no mention of the policeraid in Szczecin.   Wroclaw opposition leader Jozef Pinior said after hearing thespeech on television that ``The authorities may succeed inpacifying the strikers now, but the wave of strikes will return inone, two or three months.''   Romuald Ziolkowski, chairman of the strike committee at theDabie bus depot in Szczecin, said that during the raid, the riotpolice were throwing strikers ``into police vans like pigs.''   ``There was crying and screaming there,'' he added.   Raids also occurred at streetcar stations and at the bus depotin Police, a city outside of Szczecin, about 7 p.m., Ziolkowskisaid.   About 100 people were at each of the three depots, and 50-70people were detained at each site, he said. The strikers weregreatly outnumbered and ``they resisted passively,'' he saidwithout elaborating.   Before the police action in Szczecin, authorities had detainedat least 10 people nationwide and threatened criminal chargesagainst strike organizers.   ``We must fight for reforms. We must fight for Solidarity. Thereis no other way,'' Solidarity leader Lech Walesa told a crowd ofyoung workers at the 10,000-worker Lenin shipyard. The shipyard hasbeen in ailing financial shape and is under threat of closure, buthas symbolic importance as the birthplace of the Solidarity tradeunion eight years ago.   The ongoing strikes at 10 coal mines were costing the country$1.3 million a day, the government said. Coal exports are a majorsource of hard currency to repay Poland's daunting $39 billionforeign debt, the biggest in the East bloc.   Some Gdansk port workers also began striking Monday, accordingto Western journalists in the city. A Solidarity spokesman, JacekKuron, said 3,000 dockworkers in the city were on strike.   Although the shipyard strike had been announced in advance,police did not interfere as workers marched around the sprawlingyard bearing Polish national flags and took over the main gate at8:35 a.m.   Later in the morning, riot police moved in to cordon offapproaches to the yard.   In scenes reminiscent of a nine-day strike at the shipyard inMay that ended without a settlement, strikers chanted Solidarityslogans and posted banners on the shipyard fence, helping somesupporters who had been locked out to scramble over the gate.   Shortly after, Walesa arrived in a red compact car and ralliedthe strikers.   ``Everything is closed and the whole shipyard is on strike,''Walesa said later by telephone from his home in Gdansk.   Walesa was spending the night in the Lenin shipyard with about1,000 strikers, said union adviser Adam Michnik. Sources saidpolice allowed Walesa, because of his stature, to re-enter theplant after the cordon was in place.   In the phone interview from his home, Walesa blamed the strikeson authorities, whom he said have refused to engage in dialoguewith workers.   ``I wanted to avoid strikes,'' he said. ``We shouldn't bestriking. We should be working. But there was no other choice ...We are still waiting for serious talks.''   None of the shipyard's towering cranes appeared to be operating,and a foreman speaking through a fence said all departments wereshut down.   Workers could be seen strolling, taking naps or perching onfences and walls around the yard.   ``If you work only eight hours a day, you make 40,000 zlotys($89) a month, and that's not enough to make a living,'' said oneman in his mid-20s.   Opposition groups reported at least 10 instances of unrest atvarious factories around the country Monday.   Activists in Warsaw reported an attempt to start a strike at the14,000-worker Ursus tractor plant outside the capital. Policedispersed a morning rally at the plant and detained three people,activist Maciej Jankowski said.   A management spokesman at Ursus confirmed an unsuccessfulattempt to strike at the plant, but made no mention of police andsaid work continued normally.   In southeastern Poland, Solidarity organizer Ewa Kuberna saidworkers rallied at the 18,000-employee Stalowa Wola steel mill andheavy machinery plant, and a strike was launched by 2,000 of theworkers.   Opposition spokesman Wojciech Maziarski also reported newstrikes or partial strikes at the Cegielski turbine works inPoznan, the Huta Warszawa steel mill in Warsaw and the RailroadConstruction Enterprise of Szczecin.   Government spokesman Ryszard Straus said he had no informationabout any stoppages at Cegielski or the Szczecin railroadenterprise.</TEXT></DOC>
