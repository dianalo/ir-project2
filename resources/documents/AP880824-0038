The government is keeping the rebels near the Nicaraguan borderto prevent instability in Honduras, Foreign Minister Carlos LopezContreras said Tuesday.   Contra officials have said more than 14,000 rebels and civiliansupporters of their campaign against Nicaragua's leftist Sandinistaleaders entered Honduras in the past four months, seeking refugeand humanitarian aid distributed by the United States.   Lopez Contreras said Honduras was allowing the U.S. aid to reachthe Contras as part of the peace plan signed last year by fiveCentral American presidents.   He said the Contras cross the frontier frequently because, underthe plan, they were to be assigned to a zone in Nicaragua thatborders Honduras. But he acknowledged that some Contras were``entering Honduras as refugees, then later returning to theircountry to fight.''   Since 1981, the U.S.-supported rebels have maintained base campsin Honduras in their fight to overthrow the Sandinistas. Aprovisional cease-fire has been in effect in Nicaragua since March21.   Lopez Contreras noted that anti-communist rebels from Nicaraguaand leftist guerrillas from El Salvador have used frontierterritory for their war bases, damaging Honduras' social stability.   He said the superpowers had created ``peculiar'' problems forHonduras, with the United States supporting the Contras and theSoviet bloc backing Nicaragua's Sandinista government and theSalvadoran rebels.   There have been several anti-American demonstrations this yearin Honduras, which is considered one of Washington's strongestallies in the region.</TEXT></DOC>
