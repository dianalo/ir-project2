(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL's new trustee has warned that the TVministry built by Jim and Tammy Bakker will have to go off the airand close its Christian theme park next month if contributions keepdwindling.   After Tuesday's hearing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court, tearful PTLcontributors urged the trustee to allow Bakker's appearance oncable television to solicit donations they said would save theministry.   M.C. ``Red'' Benton, the trustee, said he wouldn't rule outallowing Bakker's limited return _ ``if it's the best and logicalnext step for the ministry.''   PTL, with current debts of about $130 million and assets of $160million, filed for reorganization and protection from creditors inbankruptcy court in June after Bakker's resignation in a sex andhush-money scandal.   ``We're considerably short of money now, and we're going to haveto have some money soon to operate. Contributions have about driedup,'' Benton said at the hearing.   In the last three weeks, contributions have dwindled from$60,000 a day to $22,000 a day, Benton said. It costs $27,000 a dayjust to pay the network affiliates, he said later.   Benton testified that the ministry may not be able to keepairing the ``PTL Club'' TV show, its primary method of seekingcontributions. ``The next step is to shut down, and that I'mprepared to do,'' he said.   Benton was appointed Friday to succeed former ChristianBroadcasting Network executive David Clark, who said he resigned sohe wouldn't have to preside over the ministry's liquidation.   A revised reorganization plan filed last week called for thetrustee to liquidate PTL's assets in order to pay creditors.   Under the proposal, the 2,300-acre Heritage USA complex in FortMill would be sold and a separate, non-profit corporation wouldlease the property required to operate the church and networktelevision programs.   PTL is negotiating with non-religious buyers, including a sportsexecutive who wants to build a sports complex on the grounds.   After the hearing, Paul Wood, a spokesman for a group of PTL'sbig-money contributors, said the donors represents had pledged $81million to the ministry if Bakker is allowed on the PTL network``to ask for forgiveness.''   ``Everybody else has tried and failed _ why not Bakker?'' saidWood.   Benton, PTL executive vice president for accounting andoperational affairs since Feb. 1, said that PTL should be able tomeet the June 3 payroll, but that he was uncertain whetheroperating expenses could be met after that date.</TEXT></DOC>
