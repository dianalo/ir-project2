In Johannesburg, a mob of whites threatened to kill an Indian manwho hoped to be their neighbor.   Near Cape Town, a blond, 5-year-old boy was expelled last weekfrom an all-white nursery school. Wayne Shirley was ``a lovely andintelligent boy,'' the principal in Kraaifontein said, and he waslegally classified as white, but he could not stay because hismother had mixed racial ancestry.   Practices like these pervade South African society. What sets thecountry apart, however, is not the existence of racism, but the factthat it is permitted, even mandated, by many of the people in power.   When right-wing whites resegregated parks in the city of Boksburglast year and blocked the Indian man from moving into theirneighborhood last weekend, they were scolded by the government andthe press. But they had the law on their side.   Employers face no penalties if they hire according to race, butcolorblind landlords face heavy fines. Government schools mustpractice segregation, and private schools are entitled to do so.Municipal governments are empowered to bar blacks from parks, busesor beaches.   ``The racists and bigots will exploit laws as long as they remainon the statute books,'' said Brian Currin, director of Lawyers forHuman Rights.   President P.W. Botha's government has spoken out against racismwith increasing frequency in recent years. In November, it banned asmall white-supremacist group, and it has outlawed the incitement ofracial hostility.   ``If apartheid means ... racial discrimination and encroachmenton human dignity, then I reject it out of hand,'' Botha said in 1986.   But rarely is the government's rhetoric accompanied by toughaction. The recent banning of the White Liberation Movement has notbeen followed by steps against the larger, more powerful AfrikanerResistance Movement, despite its white-supremacist ideology,Nazi-style symbols and paramilitary training programs.   Nor did police disperse the mob that gathered Sunday outside ahouse in Johannesburg's Mayfair West district, draped a noose over awall, and shouted threats at the Indian who planned to move hisfamily into the white neighborhood.   ``Years of forced separation and years of racist indoctrinationhave resulted in people behaving in such abominable ways,'' said TheSowetan, a black newspaper, in a subsequent editorial.   Information Minister Stoffel van der Merwe said in an interviewthat the Mayfair West incident could have happened in the UnitedStates or Britain.   The government was conducting a ``campaign of persuasion'' todiminish white racism, he said, ``but if you overdo that, you createa reaction.''   ``The eradication of racism from a society is a very complicated,long-term undertaking, as evidenced by the American experience,''van der Merwe said. ``Compared to 10 years ago, we've madetremendous progress.''   Van der Merwe described Wayne Shirley's expulsion from nurseryschool as ``very unfortunate.''   ``When one lives in a society in a state of change, there is agap between morality and legality,'' he said, noting that theprincipal acted lawfully.   The government says blatant racism will worsen South Africa'sinternational isolation, but it refuses to outlaw segregation oflocal facilities or residential areas.   ``Unfortunately, the government is unable to act decisively insuch matters,'' said The Citizen, a pro-government newspaper.   Prosecuting non-whites who live in white areas would ``createracial tensions at home and damaging publicity abroad,'' it saidthis week. But if the government scrapped the Group Areas Act, ``itwould lose its constituency.''   Racism is practiced most enthusiastically by extreme-rightwhites, who Thursday launched a whites-only rugby league.   But bigotry exists in relatively liberal neighborhoods as well.In Johannesburg's wealthy northern suburbs, where most voters backanti-apartheid candidates, doctors willing to treat black servantsask them to use separate waiting rooms.   Neighborhood newspapers in those suburbs carry ads for``European-supervised'' plumbing or electrical services. Readersknow this means that if blacks come to their house to do repairs, awhite man will be in charge.   Despite the entrenchment of racial divisions, many South Africansare working to overcome them.   Church groups have sponsored workshops in which whites stayovernight in black townships, while blacks live with whites. Severalmultiracial private schools are flourishing.   Amanda Shirley, the mother of the expelled nursery schoolstudent, said she will seek out one of these schools for herchildren, ``where they will realize that they are equal to and nobetter than any other child.''</TEXT></DOC>
