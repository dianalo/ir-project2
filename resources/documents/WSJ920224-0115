Powerful lawmakers are lining up behind proposals to keepthe Bells in check -- at least until competitionsubstantially erodes their phone monopolies. It is uncertain,however, whether Congress can pass Bell legislation.</LP><TEXT>   Rep. Jack Brooks, chairman of the House JudiciaryCommittee, has called for an antitrust approach totelecommunications legislation. The Texas Democrat isexpected soon to introduce a bill that would limit the Bells'ability to provide information services or long-distanceservice or manufacture telecommunications gear.   The bill, he indicated, would be based on the principlesof the 1982 consent decree that broke up the Bell System.That decree barred the seven local phone giants from enteringnew markets unless they could show &quot;no substantialpossibility&quot; of using their monopoly power to hindercompetition. The Baby Bells now handle more than 99% of thelocal telephone traffic in their territories.   Such legislation would reverse last year's court decisionsallowing the seven regional phone giants to provideinformation services. The same antitrust standard also wouldapply to manufacturing and long-distance businesses.   But at a hearing last week, Mr. Brooks warned Bellopponents, including newspaper publishers, long-distancecompanies, the cable industry, telephone equipment makers andinformation service providers, that he would reject anylegislation that doesn't take into account developingcompetition. The Bells, he said, shouldn't be &quot;foreverhardened into a mold that is impervious to free-market forceseven if a competitive environment is fostered over time.&quot;   Some interest groups expect Mr. Brooks to get into ajurisdictional fight over the issue with Rep. John Dingell,the Michigan Democrat who heads the House Energy and CommerceCommittee. Aides, however, have noted that the two powerfulchairmen are personal friends whose jurisdictions oftenoverlap. At the hearing, Mr. Brooks told a standing-room-onlycrowd to expect consensus.   The Energy and Commerce Committee's telecommunicationspanel has floated a series of draft bills that would allowthe Bells -- with stringent safeguards -- into manufacturingand information services. A compromise between the two panelsis likely to require the Baby Bells to run new businessesfrom separate subsidiaries, limit transactions with the phonecompanies and follow strict accounting rules.   Chairman Edward Markey of the telecommunications panel haspromised to turn to Bell legislation once the committeefinishes thorny legislation to curb runaway cable rates andinject some competition into that monopoly industry. An aideto Chairman Dingell even suggested that the Bell legislation&quot;could be grafted onto a cable bill.&quot; That could open the wayfor the phone companies to provide cable televisionprogramming, something the White House has advocated.   Several new forces could propel legislation. Last summer'scourt decision allowing the Bells into information servicesincited the nation's newspaper publishers, who fear losingadvertising revenue to electronic yellow pages and shoppingservices run by Baby Bell information units. They also worrythat phone companies, in an effort to boost their owninformation businesses, would give their rivals inferiorphone service.   Moreover, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., for thefirst time, joined the chorus calling for legislation. ATandamp;Tis worried that the Bells may soon win court approval tocompete in long-distance service. At the hearing, ATandamp;TChairman Robert Allen took off the gloves and accused theJustice Department of &quot;losing its memory and its compass.&quot;Mr. Allen offered the lawmakers a litany of Baby Bellencroachments on consent decree restrictions -- all with theapproval of the Justice Department. In addition, ATandamp;T isconcerned about Bell lobbying power; the phone companies lastJune won Senate approval to manufacture telecommunicationsgear.   The Bells' latest tack has been to try to persuade thecourts to allow them into new fields unless it is &quot;certain&quot;they would lessen competition.</TEXT></DOC>
