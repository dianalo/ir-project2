The conduct of these people raises the question ofwhether Americans have become less attentive to theirresponsibilities, or whether the mass media are merely givingnew publicity to old behavior.   The Journal invited half a dozen prominent Americans toexpress their views on this problem. Here are their replies:                                                                                                       </LP><TEXT>   James H. Webb Jr.   Novelist; assistant secretary of defense and secretary ofthe Navy in the Reagan administration.                                                                                                          The problem is not the attitude of those who are serving.It is that those in the media, the government and the thinktanks who have been pushing us toward war too often have onlya vicarious, or even rhetorical, connection to the ultimateprice that might be paid. What we have been &quot;less attentive&quot;to is the duty to face this question: Is a war against Iraqso vital to the future of the U.S. that you would feel asense of justice staring at the grave of your own son ordaughter?   I have great confidence in the professionalism and loyaltyof those now serving. I have less confidence in those leadingthe way. This is a democracy, and our soldiers deserveanswers from their senior leadership before they are sent towar. The president, like them, has taken an oath to supportand defend the Constitution. Is it within the Constitutionfor him to initiate hostilities without a declaration of war?It is wise to do so in a region where we have no treaties, onbehalf of a country that is not a democracy, against an enemythat a few months ago was a &quot;friend,&quot; while other nations whowill benefit economically and politically sit on thesidelines at no human risk? And does this administration,whose diplomatic ineptness helped bring on the Kuwaitinvasion, have a clear idea of what a war and its aftermathshould accomplish?   If you were camped on the front lines near Kuwait, youwould be thinking about that, no matter how proud you were ofthe ability of your troops.   Americans -- including all the males in my family, somefemales, and five family members serving today -- have shownremarkable loyalty since World War II by stepping forward andrisking their lives on behalf of often-confused nationalgoals. In that period, more than 100,000 Americans haveperished on foreign battlefields. As the Cold War fades, itis even more essential that our leadership clearly justifywhat our troops may be asked to die for.                                                                                                          Richard D. Lamm   Professor of public policy at the University of Denver;governor of Colorado, 1975-1987.                                                                                                          Admiral Horatio Nelson, at the Battle of Trafalgar, ran upthis message: &quot;England expects every man to do his duty.&quot;These words sound quaint and obsolete to modern America. Wehave lost most of the American version of &quot;duty.&quot; Americansare becoming an overindulged people. We want wealth withoutwork, prosperity without investment, freedom withoutsacrifice, education without study and government serviceswithout taxes. We want to be a superpower without risk orsacrifice. We want, what no nation in history has ever had,painless prosperity and effortless democracy.   Pollster Peter Hart surveyed 1,000 young Americans betweenthe ages of 15 and 24 and found: &quot;Young people have learnedonly half of America's story. Consistent with the prioritiesthey place on personal happiness, young people revealednotions of America's unique character that emphasize freedomand license almost to the complete exclusion of service orparticipation. Although they clearly appreciate thedemocratic freedom that in their view make theirs `the bestcountry in the world to live in,' they have failed toperceive a need to reciprocate by exercising the duties andresponsibilities of good citizenship.&quot;   We, as a people, know a lot about our rights andprivileges, but little about our duties and responsibilities.We are great at asking &quot;what our country can do for us,&quot; butwe are poor at asking &quot;what we can do for our country.&quot; Eachone of us this year will get $1,000 more in federalgovernment services than we are willing to pay for in taxes,and we are putting the shortfall on our children's creditcard. We have gone from a country that produces more than itconsumes to one that consumes more than it produces. We don'teven bother to vote. Too many join the Army for the pay andbenefits, then react in horror when asked to fight.   History shows us that Rome started to decline when itscitizens stopped wanting to defend their country and lost thestern virtues that made them a great nation in the firstplace. Alas (the brave men and women in the Persian Gulfnotwithstanding), I fear we are treading that same road.                                                                                                          M. E. Bradford   Professor of English, University of Dallas; author of &quot;ABetter Guide Than Reason&quot; (Sherwood Sugden, 1979), a study ofthe Revolutionary War generation.                                                                                                          Young Americans are today no less patriotic or lesswilling to fight for their country than in earlier times.However, I believe they have been conditioned bycircumstances that have made them less certain in theirattitudes toward armed conflict, either here or overseas,than their fathers were. What I refer to is the ethos ofpersonal selfishness and doubt concerning theresponsibilities of citizenship encouraged by the mass mediaand the American intellectual establishment. Our soldiers andsailors in the Persian Gulf know full well the story of theVietnam War. They have grown to maturity in the context of acontinuous and partially successful challenge to the ancientdoctrine that membership in a society carries with it anobligation to defend that society. Nowhere in the past 20years has there been a strong and constant voice attackingthe teaching that the American people will not fight afull-scale war because we cannot endure the losses which comewith such a conflict; will not give battle unless wecompletely approve of the foreign policy of the Republic atthe moment when hostilities begin. Regardless of how oftenthe networks tell us that we cannot be insulted into war,national honor yet survives.   I find no evidence in my part of the country to supportthe opinion that we dread death more than we fear shame orsubjugation. It is true enough that the pundits and thecommentators have created some of the confusion they intend.It is also true that Southerners distrust half-hearted warsfought to achieve less than victory. But according to theteaching of history, it is the nature of republics to bewarlike since they offer personal honor to the largestpossible number of citizens and define that citizenship atleast in part by a willingness to bear arms and take a stand-- at Marathon or Hastings, at Gettysburg or Tarawa. And whenthe peace and order of Christendom are at stake.   None of what I argue here is intended to deny that therehas always been disenchantment with the intrusion of merepolitics or policy into the military affairs of the Republic.Such was the case in 1774-1783, when stories of profiteeringand private ambition in the Patriot armies brought on a lagin the martial zeal of particular American communities. Butlet the British march from one place to another, burn a townor cross a river, and the people rose to resist them even asthey quarreled among themselves about the conduct of a warfor independence. Moreover, the kind of carping andsubversion of the public will that is a commonplace withtoday's adversary journalism was not tolerated by these earlyAmericans. When Maryland's Samuel Chase published an artfuland ironic attack on the enemies of the cause of freedom,Baltimore dock workers failed to understand his humor andthrashed his printer. For them, the day of battle was not anappropriate time for the spirit of disinterested inquiry.Once the fighting had begun, ranks were closed. Only with theend of hostilities could there be forensic deliberation. Butwhen our forces were engaged, with everyone's future at risk,the &quot;appropriateness&quot; of the conflict was no longer open fordiscussion -- not until victory had been achieved.   Perhaps there are not as many Americans now prepared torisk their lives as in 1860-1865 because we are now a lessreligious people -- with less confidence in the promises ofthe Christian faith. Today's young men and women may haveless trust in the leaders of government. Certainly there is anoisy minority who would not endanger themselves even todefend our borders. And the most thoughtful of our youngpeople legitimately question whether military actions everproduce the results for which they are designed. But thesequalities in the generation now ready for battle in theArabian desert will not lessen their resolve or stay theirhand once the enemy is engaged. Insofar as our press and massmedia are suggesting something to the contrary, they identifythemselves as the voices of a counterculture --unrepresentative of a society that still has confidence inits goals and purposes, in the importance of its history tothe future of the civilized world. This much can bemaintained, however we may feel about the wisdom of a warwith Saddam Hussein.                                                                                                          Charlie Peters   Editor of The Washington Monthly.                                                                                                          The situation is terrible, and especially so in regard tothe elite's failure to serve in the military, a failure thathas been conspicuous for 25 years. The most affluent and besteducated simply don't serve as they did in the '40s and '50s.They are treating the lower middle class and the working pooras suckers who will do the dying for them. The only possiblemotives for this failure to share the risks are pacifism,selfishness and cowardice.   I urge you now to stop and think just how many wealthypacifists you know. This will give you a pretty good idea ofjust how many of the affluent are either selfish or cowardlyor both.   The most contemptible group of all consists of chickenhawks who beat the war drums but find one excuse afteranother not to risk their own skins. How can they stand tolook at themselves in the mirror?                                                                                                          Helen Thomas   UPI's Washington correspondent since 1943.                                                                                                          I don't think there is a lack of courage or will to defendthe country today. It may be more of a case of, ours toreason why, not just to do and die. We have a morequestioning society and it behooves us from past experienceto understand all. Vietnam was the watershed: After that,fighting a war without the support of the people becameunacceptable. For those asked to make the ultimate sacrifice,the least the country can do is make it all justifiable.                                                                                                          Michael J. Dugan   Commander in chief, U.S. Air Forces in Europe, 1989-1990;chief of staff of the Air Force, July 1990-September 1990.                                                                                                          Without a lengthy review of &quot;previous days,&quot; recall thatthroughout our history there have invariably been greatdebates accompanied by public turmoil and discontent overwars, even &quot;popular&quot; wars. One measure of the discontent hasbeen how citizens &quot;answer the call to arms.&quot;   How do we stack up today answering the call? I believe westack up very well indeed. Here are two dimensions: activeforce recruiting and reserve force recall. Each of theservices continues to achieve its active recruiting goals.Today, in the midst of a major deployment and with clearevidence of the president's willingness to employ &quot;allnecessary means&quot; to achieve U.S. goals, young men and womencontinue to join each of our military services at rates thatmeet service goals for both quality and quantity.   And what of the citizen-soldier answering the call?Reservists and guardsmen flew the first airplanes dispatchedto the Gulf in early August and have been at the heart of thedeployment action ever since. Air unit members have comeforward, when called, without exception. Over 8,000individual air guardsmen and reservists have volunteered, ofwhich some 5,000 have entered active duty. The majorcomplaint that I hear from reserve units is that they havenot been called up; that they are as trained and as ready asthe regulars; and that they are not being treated equitably,as full partners in the &quot;Total Force.&quot;   There has been some adverse impact on employers in areaswhere significant numbers of reservists have been called toactive duty. This too is a burden of civic duty -- one thatis being borne gracefully and patriotically across thecountry.   Well how about troop morale in Saudi Arabia? The troopsare ready to do whatever needs to be done. There is aperceptible attitude difference between the combat troops andthe support troops -- between troops &quot;at the front&quot; and thoseat rear area bases. Both categories are, however, Americans;they are culturally impatient; they share the same kind ofaction-oriented behavior patterns that we Americans bring toall our activities. Nevertheless, the troops are ready andwilling to wait or to fight or both. We should not ask orexpect them to do either silently; to complain has long beenregarded as a soldier's birthright. So be it ever]   When Americans understand the issues and the consequencesof action or inaction, I believe they are, and will continueto be, ready to serve. But they won't do so blindly; theywon't do so silently; and they won't do so withoutleadership.                                                                                                          Grant Ujifusa   Senior editor at Reader's Digest; co-author of &quot;TheAlmanac of American Politics.&quot;                                                                                                          Isoroku Yamamoto was the Harvard-educated Japanese admiralwho planned the attack on Pearl Harbor. But before the war,he was a dove, and in effect said to the hotheads from thearmy, &quot;You may think that Americans are cowardly and pursueonly private happiness. But get them mad and they will whalethe daylights out of you.&quot; Later, the somber faces on thedeck of the Missouri showed that Yamamoto was right.   His assessment of American character is still right, Ithink: It's hard for us to get mad about any war that mustnecessarily be regarded as limited. Even so, our volunteerArmy is in good shape. It doesn't have much representationfrom the top and bottom fifths of society, not many preppiesor drug hustlers. Otherwise, we have some self-selectedpeople -- more, black and white, from the South than otherplaces -- who think a little like cops who live bytraditional values, or maybe like the upwardly mobile fellows40 years ago in college on the G.I. bill.   Not a bad fighting force, assuming you don't want the copon your block to be someone who's preoccupied by Englishmetaphysical poetry or who's an underclass crook. My guess isthat the moment the Iraqi maximum leader gases or shoots hisfirst American soldier of any color, many more of our young,including preppies, will start thinking like cops. Then, asYamamoto might counsel Hussein: Watch out, buddy. They aredamn mad now]</TEXT></DOC>
