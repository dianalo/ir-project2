The ``German Question'' _ reunification with East Germany _still haunts West Germany despite its postwar emergence as afinancially strong and influential independent power.   New generations on either side of the concrete and barbed-wireborder have diluted the fervor for reunification and added to thetraditional questions of ``whether?'' and ``when?'' theconsideration, ``at what price?''   The appeal for a single Germany has gained momentum from therecent East-West warming trend.   Many West Germans have relatives in the other Germany, and aboutone in five have visited the Communist eastern state over the pastdecade, according to the Institute for Opinion Research inAllensbach.   But ``you get an entirely different picture when the Germanquestion asks not just whether reunification is desirable, butwhether one is willing to see West Germany leave the NATO allianceto achieve it,'' said the institute's Gerhard Herdegen in aninterview.   Yet in a January survey, 51 percent of the West Germans polledsaid they would be willing to trade NATO membership forreunification.   The appeal of neutrality and better relations with EasternEurope has also been reflected in Bonn's recent dispute with theNATO alliance over the future of its short-range nuclear missiles.   And it may gain momentum next month if Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev indicates during a planned visit a willingness toconsider eventual reunification, as has been predicted by someofficials.   ``We are certainly not expecting him to signal readiness forreunification, but he could indicate in some way that the subjectis open for further discussion,'' said Peter Hausmann, spokesmanfor the Christian Social Union of Bavaria, which is aligned withChancellor Helmut Kohl's governing Christian Democrats.   Others have dismissed the rekindling of reunification talk tothe recent troubles between Bonn and the NATO alliance.   ``After seemingly being filed to the archives, the subject ofGerman reunification rises again whenever German-American relationsare not doing so well, whenever Bonn does not do what Washingtonbelieves is right,'' the centrist Westdeutsche Allgemeine newspaperof Essen commented last week.   It, too, suggested Gorbachev may signal some willingness toaccept a reunited Germany, banking on a neutral state posing lessof a threat to Moscow than as a member of the NATO alliance.   Kohl, who faces a tough re-election campaign next year, has beenwaxing optimistic on the reunification question.   ``Not all of our dreams have been fulfilled,'' Kohl noted in astatement on the eve of the 40th anniversary. ``We remain under theorder of our Basic Law to make complete the unity and freedom ofGermany. In recent years the hope has grown that this goal can beachieved.''   The federal government's program for observing the anniversarynotes ``the division remains a bitter reality for Germans.''   But if West Germans have made a few tentative steps forward withthe political question of reunification, the advance has broughtthem a closer look at the costs.   Among the improvements noted in relations between the twoGermanys has been a major increase in the number of East Germansallowed to emigrate to the west, which has strained the budgets andpatience of communities hosting the settlers.   While West Germans remain committed in principle toreunification, it would require an expensive overhaul of the agingand outdated industries of the east and subsidies to boost livingstandards _ perhaps at the expense of their own.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Carol J.
