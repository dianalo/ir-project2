Last month's climb in the Labor Department's Consumer PriceIndex followed advances of 0.6 percent in January and 0.4 percentin February.   Overall, consumer prices in the past three months rose at acompound annual rate of 6.1 percent.   It was the largest quarterly increase since the first threemonths of 1987, when prices rose 6.3 percent on an annual basis,and was significantly higher than the annual consumer price risesof 4.4 percent registered for each of the past two years.   Price increases have been even steeper at the wholesale level,where inflation ran at a compound annual rate of 10.2 percent inthe January-March period, the largest quarterly increase in eightyears.   Daniel T. Van Dyke, senior economist at Bank of America in SanFrancisco, said in advance of today's report that while price riseshave moderated some since the start of the year, ``we still have aproblem'' with the pace of inflation.   ``We're in a period where the inflation rate seems to be hangingaround 5 to 5.5 percent,'' Van Dyke said. ``That is too high forany long-run kind of equilibrium and I don't think that's what theFederal Reserve has in mind either.''   Food costs last month rose twice as much as they did during theprevious month, up 0.8 percent in March after advancing 0.4 percentin February.   Energy costs, meanwhile, registered their sharpest increasesince August 1987 last month, advancing 1.1 percent after rising0.6 percent in February.   The boost in petroleum-based energy prices, up at a 22.4 percentannual rate so far this year, accounted for more than two-fifths ofthe price acceleration during the first quarter, the LaborDepartment said.   Rising food prices were responsible for nearly one-quarter ofthe price increases during the quarter, it said.   Excluding those two volatile categories, other consumer pricesrose 0.4 percent in March, the same pace as in February.   The March figures left the overall Consumer Price Index at 122.3percent of its 1982-84 base, meaning that a hypothetical selectionof goods costing $100 during the base period would have cost$122.30 in March, 70 cents more than in February.   The overall index, unlike other figures in the report, is notadjusted to remove the effect on prices of seasonal fluctuations.   President Bush told a meeting of construction unions today thatthe key to continued economic health for the nation is to bringdown inflation and interest rates by reducing the federal deficit.   ``We must keep inflation and interest rates down and ... the wayto do that is to bring the budget deficit down,'' he said.   The Labor Department offered these other details on pricechanges in March:   _The increase in food prices was largely a reflection of a 2.4percent jump in prices for meats, poultry, fish and eggs.   _Apparel prices rose 1.4 percent last month after dropping 0.2percent in February. The increase was blamed on the introduction ofhigher-priced spring and summer fashions, particularly for women.   _Gasoline prices shot up 2.1 percent in March after advancing1.7 percent during February. Gasoline prices were up 4.8 percentfor the first three months of 1989.   _Medical care costs rose 0.5 percent in March followingincreases of 0.8 percent in both January and February.   _Entertainment costs were up 0.3 percent last month, withincreased ticket prices for events such as movies, concerts andsporting events accounting for most of the increase.   Bruce Steinberg, senior economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in NewYork, said before today's report that the nation is in for ``astring of unpleasant inflation numbers for awhile.''   He said that in addition to higher costs for food and energy,rising prices for materials and wages are contributing to inflation.   The latest survey by Blue Chip Economic Indicators in Sedona,Ariz., which each month polls 50 of the nation's leadingforecasters, found the consensus estimate for inflation this yearhad risen to 4.9 percent from earlier expectations it would reach4.7 percent.   The economists forecast an easing of inflation later in theyear, reflecting some expectations that a recession will arrivelate in 1989 or early next year that would reduce price pressures,the survey found.   The Federal Reserve Board for a year has been pushing upinterest rates and tightening its grip on the money supply in aneffort to restrain economic growth and keep inflation in check.   But analysts caution that it takes a long time for slower growthto translate into lower inflation, and some fear that the Fed willtighten credit so severely that its anti-inflation campaignunintentionally pushes the country into a recession.   Steinberg said that while the economy already is showing signsof cooling as the expansion stretches into a seventh year,``historically, inflation tends to peak after the economy has pretymuch slowed down.''   ``Usually it's after the start of a recession that inflationpeaks,'' Steinberg said. ``I think it's going to be the same storythis year.''   Van Dyke, however, said the Fed should be able to avoid arecession by quickly easing up on credit should the threat of aneconomic downturn emerge.   ``If the Fed thought the economy was entering a recession, Ithink it would move extremely rapidly (to ease credit),'' Van Dykesaid. ``I think that would have an impact.''</TEXT></DOC>
