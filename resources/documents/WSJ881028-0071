The list of people receiving unemployment-insurance payments has decreased to the lowest point since the early 1970s, Labor Department reports show. As a result, the number of people receiving state benefits has fallen below 2% of those covered by jobless insurance for the first time since at least 1971, officials said.    The Labor Department reported that initial claims for regular state unemployment benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 272,000 during the week ended Oct. 15 from 293,000 the previous week. The latest figure was the lowest since mid-September of last year; it reflects a four-day week for filing claims, which included the Columbus Day holiday.    More significant, the number of people receiving regular state benefits -- including new and previous claimants -- fell in the week ended Oct. 8 to the lowest level since December 1973. That total dropped to a seasonally adjusted 1,930,000, or 1.9% of those covered by unemployment insurance, from a revised 1,965,000 the previous week, when the insured unemployment rate was 2%.    Counting all state and federal benefit programs, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits in the week ended Oct. 8 fell to 1,595,800 --the lowest level since November 1973 -- from a revised 1,631,900 a week earlier. These figures aren't seasonally adjusted.    Department officials cited the economy's sustained vigor as a major reason for the persistent drop in the number of persons getting jobless benefits. With continued economic growth, the nation's unemployment rate dropped to 5.4% in September, nearly the lowest level in 14 years. In addition, officials said a tightening of federal and state eligibility requirements has helped reduce the number of people on jobless benefits.    Union and other critics of how the unemployment-compensation program is working placed more emphasis on those policy changes. They said revisions in unemployment-insurance law under the Reagan administration have made it more difficult for the jobless to qualify for benefits, limited federal funds and put restrictions on states that have forced them to limit financing of jobless-pay programs.    Moreover, without any programs for extended jobless pay, many people who have been unemployed a long time have exhausted their benefits, they added.    &quot;The system has become more restrictive,&quot; said James Ellenberger, an AFL-CIO official. He said that in September, only 26.4% of the unemployed were receiving jobless benefits.    In a recent report, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a research group that studies the effects of federal policy on low-income people, said the portion of the unemployed who get jobless pay dropped in 1987 for the fifth straight year -- to a record low of 31.5% on average. This year, the monthly percentages are running about the same as last year.    Such critics contend the insurance system won't be able to cope with any sharp rise in the number of unemployed seeking jobless pay when the next recession occurs. Despite a General Accounting Office report warning that system reserves are inadequate, and recent congressional hearings on the issue, &quot;we're still a long way from beginning to correct the problem, at least through federal action,&quot; said Isaac Shapiro, a research analyst for the budget and policy group.    The Reagan administration contends that strong economic growth will ensure there are adequate funds for unemployment insurance, by assuring that enough revenues are raised through employer taxes and by holding down joblessness. The portion of the unemployed getting jobless benefits shouldn't be as high as in some past years, when special extended benefit programs were added because of recessions, administration officials say.    In addition, jobless pay isn't supposed to cover certain people, such as those who quit their jobs, are fired for cause, have little or no work experience, or who go back to work, said Mary Ann Wyrsch, the unemployment-insurance service director for the Labor Department. </TEXT></DOC>
