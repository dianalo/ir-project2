<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-37-0106 </DOCNO><TEXT>Highlights of NRL Research in 1986 include: Structures were identifiedfor a novel class of antimalarial drugs having a new type of silver coordination;glass fibers having an optical loss of 0.9dB/km at 2.5 microns, witha potential for 0.01 dB/km, were produced from zirconium, barium, lanthanum,aluminum, and sodium fluorides as a replacement for silica glass in long-lengthglass communication links; a new monotonic Lagrangian gird tracking algorithmwas developed to provide rapid access of computerized data on the nearneighbors of any object in many-body systems ranging from battlefieldscenarios to molecular dynamics simulations of biological arrays; effectsof the sea-air temperature differential and wind stress on radar backscatterwere determined through both airborne and sea-surface measurements; NRL'sairborne geophysical sensor suite was used in the remote detection ofanomalies in magnetic and gravity fields caused by the earth's crustalvariations beneath the ice-covered Weddell Sea; a system was designedand tested to measure radiation effects on integrated circuits; powertransistors and solid-state transmitter architectures for wideband high-powershipboard radars were developed; surface acoustic wave chemical microsensorswere shown to discriminate between CW agents and begnign species; a diode-pumpednonneodymium rare-earth laser based on the 2.1-micron holmium transitionwas demonstrated. A high-energy density pulser was developed.</TEXT></DOC>
