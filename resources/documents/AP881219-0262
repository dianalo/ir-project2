But unlike the one-time shock of collapsing stock values _ whichthe economy proved resilient enough to overcome _ the unprecedentedaccumulation of debt threatens long-term indigestion.   The economy's course is impossible to predict, of course. No oneknew when the current expansion began in 1982 that it would still begoing six years later, a peacetime record. The next recession mayturn out to be just a brief, mild slump.   But some economists believe debt has made the economy so fragile,the next time it falls, it may break rather than bend.   ``What you have to worry about in all these things is whetherthere's a serious threat of bank trouble,'' said CharlesKindleberger, a retired Massachusetts Institute of Technologyeconomist.   The crash of 1987 took the mania out of the stock market, but now``leveraged buyouts seem to have picked up in a manic way,'' saidKindleberger, author of a 1978 book, ``Manias, Panics and Crashes: AHistory of Financial Crises.''   Leverage is a concept Americans grasp young, when they firstnotice that one child at the long end of a seesaw can hold up two onthe short end. A loan likewise expands a person's or company'sfinancial potential.   But seesaws can suddenly tip the other way, and so can loans.   Some corporate debtors may be gambling that they will beprotected from the consequences of their actions by the FederalReserve, the nation's central bank, which would open the moneyspigots in a recession to keep them from defaulting.   The problem is that easy money, while good for LBO artists, meanshigh inflation for everybody else. So far there is no sign that theFed is going easy on the money supply. In fact, it has tightened,because the economy is growing strongly. The acid test will be thenext downturn.   Here are the flash points:   _Corporations are loading up on debt to finance takeovers, toescape takeovers, or simply to take advantage of the taxdeductibility of interest payments. In the mid-1970s, corporationshad $5 of pretax profit for each dollar of interest they paid. Nowthey scrape by with $2.   _Banks are lending money for leveraged buyouts and commercialreal estate the same way they once lent liberally to Latin America.Things are already shaky. Although 1988 will be a record year forbank profits, it will also set a record for bank failures.   _Business is not alone in the debt pileup. Families are borrowingto make up for the stagnation in wages and salaries that began inthe 1970s, and household debt is at record levels.   What makes leveraged buyouts a particular concern is thatborrowers admit in many cases that the only way they can pay offtheir loans is by selling off assets. The question is, to whom?   The crash of 1987 proved to stock investors that buyers, liketaxi cabs in the rain, become scarce just when you need them most.Buyers may be just as scarce when the economy slumps and indebtedcompanies desperately need to sell assets to pay interest.   Even aside from LBOs, corporate America has become so attractedto debt that a AAA bond rating is almost an embarrassment in somecircles _ a sign to some that a company is not sufficientlyaggressive.   It is true that companies in Japan and West Germany are moreheavily indebted than American companies. But banking companies inthose countries directly or indirectly own big stakes in theborrowers so they make sure they will not fail. In the UnitedStates, banks and bondholders are less sympathetic.   Using a computer simulation, the Brookings Institution calculatedthat one big U.S. corporation in 10 would run out of cash by the endof the second year of a recession as bad as the last one.   ``We are going to go into the next recession with basically halfthe interest coverage we had prior to the 1980-82 downturn. We'dhave to expect that there are going to be more corporate defaults,''said John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.   ``The great danger is the following: When a company finds itselfin a position where it has become difficult to satisfy its interestobligations, it has to come up with cash to stave off bankruptcy. Itdoes it by laying off workers, reducing operations.   ``But if many companies are forced to do this, what will thenhappen is the recession will become all the more intense. That isthe great worry that all Fed policymakers face when they go aheadand tighten the money supply,'' Lonski said.   Other economists say the debt danger can be overdrawn. It is notclear that raising money by issuing debt endangers the economy morethan raising money by selling stock, said Robert Dugger, chiefeconomist of the American Bankers Association.   Any recession that is so bad that it triggers a cascade ofdefaults ``is already so deep that everybody's pretty much wiped outanyway,'' Dugger said.   Still, economists agree that reversing the long decline in thenational rate of savings would put the economy on a sounder footing.   Ironically, the Fed's success in wringing inflation out of theeconomy in the 1980s raised debt burdens by setting off an explosionof distress borrowing. Consumers, businesses and the government tookon new debt to service the old.   Federal spending, which is often fingered as a culprit in theAmerican debt binge, may be getting more than its fair share ofcriticism. The federal budget deficit is actually shrinking as aportion of economic output and is smaller proportionately than inJapan or West Germany.   If Americans saved more, the United States as a whole _government, corporations and individuals _ would not need to borrowso heavily from overseas. The trade deficit would fall andforeigners would not be able to buy up as many American factoriesand Treasury bills.   As 1989 begins, there are some reasons to think the debt bingemay be dampened soon.   In the coming session, Congress will consider removing the taxadvantages of loading up on corporate debt by eliminating thedeductibility of some portion of junk bond interest payments.   Federal regulators may press banks that make risky LBO loans tobuild their loan-loss reserves or raise their capital above requiredminimums.   Aside from government action, the markets themselves arebeginning to put a lid on leveraged buyouts by shying away from theriskiest corporate bond issues.   In contrast to other debt crises, the credit risk of merger maniais getting plenty of publicity. And that may be the best thing forit.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Yearend Editions</NOTE></DOC>
