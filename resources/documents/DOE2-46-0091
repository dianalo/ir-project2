The durabilityand range of applications of the ceramic fiber have been establishedat temperatures below 250{sup 0}C based on the experiences with the fiberin the past 20 years or more. The alumina fiber has been establishedas a fire-resistant substance at temperatures exceeding 1,250{sup 0}Cin the continuous heating furnaces and molten steel crucibles but hasnot yet applied to other fields. Alumina fibers with a different ratioof Al{sub 2}O{sub 3} and SiO{sub 2}, crystal structures and fiber diametershave been developed for application to various fields. A continuous aluminafiber has also been developed. These fibers are used for fire-resistantapplications and FRM. Application of the alumina fiber to various fieldsis anticipated as fibers suitable for specific application are available.(12 figs, 2 tabs, 23 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
