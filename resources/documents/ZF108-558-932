ScheierandM;ATLANTA -- For PC managers wondering how to justify the cost of upgrading toWindows 3.0, Microsoft Corp. had some well-timed news earlier this month.andM;Microsoft took advantage of the Comdex/Spring trade show here to unveil astudy showing that users of grapical user interfaces (GUIs) do 58 percentmore correct work in a given period than do users of older, character-basedsystems.andM;Some beta testers of Windows 3.0 expressed skepticism about the size of theproductivity gain.andP;  But Mike Maples, vice president of Microsoft'sapplications division in Redmond, Wash., said the productivity boost meansthat companies that buy the hardware and software needed to run Windows 3.0can recoup their investment in as little as a year.andM;Along with the productivity gains, GUI users felt less frustration andfatigue than did users of character-based DOS systems, according to thestudy.andM;New users of graphical systems rated their frustration at 2.7 on a scale of 1to 10, compared to a frustration level of 5.3 out of 10 for neophyteslearning the ropes on character-based systems.andM;The study, co-funded by Microsoft and Zenith Data Systems, attempted tomeasure productivity gains only for measurable tasks such as data entry anddata manipulation, not such harder-to-measure benefits as improveddecision-making or analysis.andM;Beta testers of the graphical user interface differed in their assessments ofthe Microsoft study.andM;Mike Drips, an analyst with U.S.andP;  Sprint Communications Co. in Overland Park,Kan., thought the 50 percent productivity gain &quot;might be a little on theexaggerated side.andP;  I can see maybe 15, 20 percent minimum, but I think 50percent might be the optimum.&quot;andM;&quot;It depends on what they're doing,&quot; said Clay Harper, a project leader in theresearch and development group at Dow Chemical Co. in Freeport, Texas.andP;  Forusers who often move data between applications, Harper said, it wouldn't besurprising to see a 35 percent productivity improvement following a move toWindows 3.0.andM;For users working in one application at a time, a productivity increase wouldbe hard to quantify, said Brian Hayden, a senior systems manager for Merrill,Lynch andamp; Co. in New York.andP;  &quot;When you start talking about a variety ofapplications, graphical packages vs.andP;  word processing, I think I would agree.andO;You won't need to learn a new interface for every application.&quot;andM;But Jude Gartland, senior vice president of investment banking with ShearsonLehman Hutton Inc. in New York, said the biggest productivity gains wouldcome from the ability to switch between various applications, not from thegraphical user interface itself.andM;And Tom Ferguson, a research analyst for the city of Phoenix, Ariz., saidthat for experienced users of character-based interfaces, moving data betweenapplications &quot;isn't a real drag on productivity.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
