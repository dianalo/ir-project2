The board's ruling, released by the United Steelworkers ofAmerica on Monday, compels USX to reimburse workers at overtimerates in instances _ totaling as many as 1,100 _ where work was lostbecause of outside hiring that violated the steelworkers' contract,union officials said.   ``It's an enormous victory for the union that shows that whatwe've said about contracting out is true,'' Steelworkers unionpresident Lynn Williams told reporters.   The arbitration board examined 24 grievances at the company'sFairless Works outside Philadelphia. The union and the companyselected those cases because they were said to represent some 1,100pending complaints by workers.   The board held that back pay was entitled in all but five of the24 cases. No award was granted in three, and the remaining two werereturned to the parties for more information before a final decisionis rendered.   The union studied the back pay awards and found one to be worthabout $700,000.   ``Another of the 24 test cases involved 900-1,000 hours andseveral involved 200-300 hours. If these are typical of the 1,100pending cases, the company's liability should easily reach $8million to $10 million,'' union leaders said in a memorandum tomembers.   The document urged workers to ``guard against wheeling anddealing aimed at selling your jobs to outside contractors or buyingthe right to do so.'' The issue of outside hiring had been centralto a six-month walkout by USX workers in 1987.   In his decision, arbitration board chairman Alfred Dybeck alsosaid that after one year, a ``cease and desist'' order will be ineffect barring outside hiring for specified types of work.   Maintenance, repair and service work were all at issue in thecase. USX conceded that it hired from outside, but argued that noremedy should be imposed because Fairless workers were already fullyemployed and many were working overtime.   The union countered that employees could have worked moreovertime than what was offered.   Fairless is one of the last plants to use open-hearthsteelmaking, which dominated the industry for years. It is theoldest steelmaking technology in use in the country.   ``Our recent contracting out procedures there have been affectedby the severe shortage of skilled labor in the area around theplant,'' USX spokesman Tom Farrell said in a telephone interviewfrom Pittsburgh. ``We have encountered some difficulty in hiringqualified people for certain crafts,'' he said.   Farrell said the company was still interpreting the ruling andhad no immediate comment on it.</TEXT></DOC>
