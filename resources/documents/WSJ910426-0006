Continental Airlines and USAir this month started offeringmajor travel agencies a $50 bonus -- on top of their usual10% to 15% commission -- for round-trip flights on 10 majorroutes out of New York. Travel experts call the commission analarmingly large reward that could easily sway agencies torecommend flights that aren't in the traveler's bestinterest.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The airlines wouldn't be offering this if they didn'tthink it would affect a travel agent's behavior,&quot; says DougBirdsall, president of Travelmation Inc., a Stamford,Conn.-based travel management company. Adds John Holland,publisher of the Business Flyer: &quot;To me, this is likebribery.&quot;   Continental concedes the size of the offer is unusual;other industry followers called it unprecedented. The carrieralso says the offer will expire at the end of June andinsists it won't spread to other markets. The unit ofContinental Airlines Holdings Inc. said it only raised thecommission ante to promote some new flights out of New York.   But industry followers note that the offer already hasspread from four routes out of New York to 10 in less than aweek. And Northwest Airlines, another major New York carrier,says it is studying the move. &quot;I think you'll start to seethis in some other major cities,&quot; says Mr. Holland. &quot;Theairlines are fighting for ways to get more market sharewithout having to lower fares and go bankrupt.&quot;   Travel agents insist they wouldn't go against a customer'sbest interest because that could risk losing their business.&quot;Nobody's going to push a flight that's a lot moreexpensive,&quot; says Philip Davidoff, president of the AmericanSociety of Travel Agents. But industry followers say thatbecause air fares literally change minute by minute,travelers aren't likely to know if their agent is tellingthem about the best deal. And agents rarely inform travelersabout any special commissions.   Many agents are also under pressure to boost revenuebecause the travel business is coming off one of its worstslumps in years. Airline traffic began slowing last year anddropped sharply during the Mideast war. Some agencies arealso hurting because corporate clients are starting to demandpart of an agent's commission. Agencies that don't agree tothis arrangement can risk losing the client.   Although travelers can contact airlines directly, morethan 80% of them book their flights with travel agencies.Agents usually get 10% commission on tickets, plus anadditional 1% to 5% that is often based on the number offlights they ticket on a certain carrier. Under the newoffer, an agent could almost double his or her take oncertain tickets. The extra money, at a minimum, would meanthat an agent wouldn't lose money on very low-priced tickets;the cost of booking a ticket sometimes exceeds the actualcommission on fares of less than $200.   USAir, a unit of USAir Group Inc., wouldn't provide manydetails on its offer. A spokesman for Continental said thebonus was offered mainly to the major agencies that bookflights for corporate customers, although vacation travelerssometimes book flights with these agents, too. The bonus of$25 on one-way tickets and $50 on round trip flights appliesto unrestricted fares used mainly by business fliers.   Continental said it originally offered the bonus onflights out of New York to Detroit, Atlanta, Buffalo, N.Y.,and Columbus, Ohio. The carrier said it started the offerbecause it recently added some new service out of LaGuardiaairport.</TEXT></DOC>
