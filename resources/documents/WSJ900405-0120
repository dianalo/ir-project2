Smoke belches from a forest of smokestacks. Snow falls onMain Street. Teenagers huddle, waiting to hear a local punkband called Dead Future. &quot;They scream too much but theirlyrics are good,&quot; says Nikolas Tyde, a broad-shouldered17-year-old blond. &quot;They sing about Sweden going down. Thereis revolution in Eastern Europe, and what happens here?&quot; Hestamps cold feet, crushes a Coke can. &quot;Same rules. Newtaxes.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Such are the stirrings of trouble in paradise. Sweden --placid, prosperous, and smug -- has the shivers. Economicstagnation is pinching the social-welfare life style to whichSwedes are accustomed. Rapid change abroad, coupled withinertia at home, has Swedes wondering if their vaunted modelis falling out of fashion.   This self-doubt is surfacing just as Eastern Europeansflood to Stockholm for tutelage in Sweden's &quot;middle way&quot;between communism and capitalism: a free-market economy,committed to social justice.   &quot;The Swedish model doesn't suit Eastern Europe -- or usanymore,&quot; says Ake Andersson, director of Stockholm'sInstitute for Future Studies. &quot;We were never a Romania orPoland.&quot;   Instead, Sweden was a small, homogenous and thrivingnation when it fashioned the high-tax welfare state that hasbecome its trademark. Mr. Andersson adds that the Swedishmodel, with its tight central controls, isn't agile enough tofit a dynamic European market. &quot;We're still trying to danceclassical ballet on the set of `West Side Story,'&quot; he says.   Swedish angst requires some perspective. Sweden hasunemployment of 1.4%, a budget surplus and well-swept streetscrowded with Saabs. Pressed to identify decline, Swedesusually point to litter on the subway or the sight ofbeggars.   Even so, worrying signs are appearing. Sweden's wageinflation of 10% is double the European average, its growthrate of 1.5% is less than half the Continent's. Soaring coststhreaten Sweden's export-oriented industries, which also facetougher competition from a uniting Europe.   The biggest growth area of the Swedish economy, the publicsector, consumes 61% of gross national product. Governmentattempts at austerity have flopped.   History helps explain why Sweden resists change -- and whyno nation outside Scandinavia has come close to replicatingits success. Sweden last fought a war in 1814, missed the1930s depression, and boomed after World War II, when Europeand Japan lay in tatters. With its overwhelmingly Nordic,Lutheran and well-educated population, Sweden has enjoyedremarkable consensus. The Social Democrats have ruled for 52of the past 58 years.   Sweden's welfare state remains the world's most lavish andequitable, providing basic hospital care for under $10 a day,high-quality education for nominal fees, and generous childallowances.   Swedes may take 15 months parental leave -- a year at 90%to 100% pay, the rest at a lower rate -- and parents maysplit the time. Workers get a minimum of five paid weeks ofvacation a year.   Sweden's taxes, long the world's highest, are falling,with the highest marginal tax rate currently 62%. But tomaintain revenue, the state has raised sales taxes andextended them to more goods, pushing already high prices intothe stratosphere. A gallon of gas costs $4, a pack ofcigarettes $5, a pint of beer $7, and a loaf of white bread$3 to $4, though housing is affordable. Overall, Swedes' realincome has been flat for 20 years.   More irksome to many Swedes is what they regard as the BigBrother tendencies of their carefully engineered state.Non-cable television is limited to two state-run channels,which broadcast only about seven hours a day. Television andradio advertising is prohibited on these channels, which arethe only ones that most Swedes receive. Alcohol sales arebarred at nights and on weekends. Private schools andhospitals are almost nonexistent. The 23% sales tax largelydictates how Swedes spend their money.   Though almost all are middle class, many speak enviouslyof what they perceive as greater buying power in the U.S.High taxes and small wage differentials between skilled andunskilled work have sapped incentive to work overtime or togain skills that bring little extra money.   Stefan Johansson assembles truck engines on Saab-Scania's&quot;disco line,&quot; so-called because the unit spent its annualbonus on a quadraphonic sound system. On this day, as on mostothers, a third of the factory's work force is off sick, onholiday or on other authorized leave.   &quot;A lot of the young guys aren't motivated,&quot; says Mr.Johansson, 38, greasing engine parts to the beat ofheavy-metal music. The biggest problem, he says, is abuse offully paid sick leave. &quot;Why work when you can earn the sameat home?&quot;   With unemployment so low, workers know they can easilyfind other jobs if they are dissatisfied. Last year,Saab-Scania had 29% turnover, twice the rate that prevailedin 1985. The mobility and the absenteeism mean that newpeople are always on the line, hampering productivity andquality control.   Swedes are slowly accepting the need for incentives. Toptax rates fall to 50% next year. Sick leave is likely to bereformed, with employers assuming more control overabsentees. But Sweden seems reluctant to go beyondfine-tuning its system. Says the Future Institute's Mr.Andersson: &quot;You can't slaughter sacred cows overnight, evenif it's the only way to keep your belly full.&quot;   With a third of Swedish workers in the public sector --more than double the U.S. rate -- Swedes strongly resistdismantling the bureaucracy.   But almost every economic indicator is dire. Consumerprices leaped 3.2% in January, and some big multinationalshave reported falling profits. Swedish industries, whichexport 40% of their output, are rapidly moving production tosuch countries as Portugal, where costs are lower.   Borlange, an industrial city in the piney woods of centralSweden, has kept unemployment to nearly zero throughretraining and other measures, even though the steelworks hascut its labor force by half.   At a high-tech paper mill, many workers labor without aforeman, in a factory with 50-foot-high windows and wallmurals of woods and ponds. The last major strike at the millwas in 1909.   Yet young people feel aimless, trapped and most of all,bored. The popular punk band, Dead Future, speaks to theyoung by singing about drugs and hatred for the city's MiddleEastern immigrants -- a common scapegoat for the strains inSweden's welfare system.   &quot;For too long we assumed that taking care of physicalneeds was enough,&quot; says Mr. Andersson, a former defenseminister and currently regional head of the Social Democrats.He says Sweden can learn from Eastern Europe. The turmoilthere, he says, shows that even the most fossilized systemscan change. &quot;Now that communism is dying,&quot; he says, &quot;perhapswe need a new middle way between the old Sweden and the newEurope.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
