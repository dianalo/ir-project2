 Thismeans that all of the features that are planned for customer release havebeen completed, and the software is now ready for testing and debugging.andP;  Asthis process proceeds Apple will gradually expand the seeding program.andP;  Somedevelopers already have alpha System 7 software to work with.andP;  Others will begetting copies in the coming months as the system becomes more robust.andO;Depending on how the debugging phase goes, System 7 will probably be readyfor customer shipment sometime this summer.andM;At its Developer's Conference last May, Apple laid out an ambitious list offeatures and functions it expects to include in future system software.andO;Most, but not all, of these will be included in the 1990 System 7 release.andP;  Afew did not make the cut and will probably not appear until the next majorsystem software release (1991?).andM;What is included.andP;  The key new capabilities of System 7 are:andM;* Apple Royal format outline fonts.andM;* Sophisticated procedures, protocols and a programming language tofacilitate direct communication between application programs.andM;* Built-in facilities for full AppleShare file access between any twoMacintoshes on a network.andM;* A new, streamlined Finder that makes setting up and using a Macintosh eveneasier, that removes the practical distinction between &quot;desk accessory&quot;programs and normal application programs, and that introduces a powerful newconcept of &quot;alias&quot; file names.andM;* Built-in CL/1 database access protocols.andM;* Support for full 32-bit memory addressing and for virtual memory on 68030machines and on 68020 machines equipped with the optional memory managementchip.andM;What is not included.andP;  the two new Apple technologies that will not makeSystem 7 are:andM;* Line layout manager.andP;  (Built-in support for on-the-fly kerning, ligaturegeneration and the like.)andM;* Print architecture.andP;  (Unified support for all manner of output printers andimagers.)andM;Evolutionary strategy.andP;  In most respects, we think that Apple's strategy isadmirable.andP;  It is giving both users and software developers an evolutionarypath into the future that both should be able to understand and manage.andM;Moving to System 7 will involve some effort.andP;  (It requires 2 MB of memory,and not all old Mac programs will run on System 7.)andP;  However, compared to thechanges faced by PC or Unix workstation users, the upgrade should be abreeze.andP;  Although it introduces powerful and important new capabilities,System 7 should actually be easier to install and use than the current System6 software.andP;  A great many existing programs are already &quot;32-bit clean&quot; and dorun on System 7 without modification.andP;  Most of the rest will probably becleaned up by the time System 7 is in the field.andM;And if you do not want to upgrade all of your Macs to 2 MB of memory, you canintermix System 7 and System 6 machines on the same network.andM;User Benefits.andP;  Most of all, we think that Ssytem 7 will provide bothimmediate benefits that users will appreciate from &quot;day one&quot; and substantialroom for future growth.andM;It is very difficult to explain the benefits of the new generation ofoperating environments either to users or to office-productivity-focusedcomputer press and computer analysts.andP;  This is one of the problems that Next,IBM and Microsoft are all wrestling with.andP;  We have little doubt that oncepeople have experienced the benefits of a rich computing environment, theywould never contemplate going back to the &quot;old&quot; way of doing things.andP;  But thetransition is daunting.andP;  The system vendors must convince appliction softwaredevelopers to develop software for the new environment before there is alarge pool of buyers and they must convince users to pay for the powerful newhardware required to run the environment before there is much applicationsoftware to exploit the environment and before users really understand whythey need this stuff in any event.andM;It looks as if Apple will largely manage to avoid this problem.andP;  Macintoshsoftware developers and Macintosh users have a head start because theyalready have a consistent graphic environment and limited multitaskingthrough Multifinder.andP;  System 7 will give them a lot of new capabilities, someof which they will appreciate right away, and others that they will come tovalue over time.andM;On the whole, Apple appears to be growing the Macintosh system platform atabout the rate that most users are going to be able to absorb and appreciate.andO;And it is doing a first-rate job of giving priority to the capabilities thatwill be of most tangible benefit to most users.andP;  All in all, it will probablytake several years before the average &quot;Joe Macintosh&quot; user really exploitsthe new System 7 capabilities.andM;Shortcomings.andP;  Unfortunately, most of our readers are not Joe Macintosh.andP;  Aswe have often commented, publishing users tend to be especiallysophisticated.andP;  Publishing applications are demanding, and publishing userstherefore tend to &quot;push the envelope&quot; of desktop computing.andM;As pleased as we are about System 7 and about the capabilities we hope to seein System 8 (Layout Manager and Print Architecture), the Mac operatingenvironment will still not have some of the &quot;industrial strength&quot;capabilities of the larger operating systems (most notably Unix and OS/2).andO;The two things we will miss most ae full pre-emptive multitasking andheavy-duty network capabilities.andM;Apple does not think that either of these are a important as we do.andP;  We willsummarize the debate later in this article (pp.andP;  22-23).andP;  First, let us takea closer look at what System 7 does include.andM;Virtuall memoryandM;Virtual memory is one of the key aspects of a large-scale (workstation,minicomputer or mainframe computer) operating environment.andP;  In simplestterms, virtual memory allows the user to pretend that his computer hassubstantially more RAM than it really has.andP;  Thus, for example, a 2-MBMacintosh can be run as if it has 4 MB of working memory.andP;  In essence, the 2MB of &quot;real&quot; memory acts as a large cache for the 4 MB of addressable memory.andO;Programs, program segments and data are stored on disk and swapped in and outof RAM as needed.andM;Swapping data and programs in and out of memory obviously takes time.andO;Virtual-memory operating systems try to be pretty clever about figuring outwhat to swap out when they have to bring new program segments or data intoRAM.andP;  (See the November, 1989, issue of Byte for a technical overview,written by an Apple system programmer, of the &quot;clock replacement&quot; algorithm.)andO;Even so, there will always be some optimum ratio of the size of &quot;virtual&quot;memory relative to &quot;real&quot; memory.andM;Based on its early tests, apple believes that a 2:1 ratio of virtual to realmemory will provide most users with the benefits of a larger working memorywith very little perceived performance loss due to swapping.andP;  This means thatfor all practical purposes, a 2-MB Mac with virtual memory will function asif it were a 4-MB machine.andP;  A 4-MB machine will function like an 8-MBmachine, etc.andP;  the system provides a typical Macintosh dialog box that allowsthe user to set the size of virtual memory to suit the mix of tasks he isperforming.andM;PMMU.andP;  As we have noted before, virtual memory requires a hardware memorymanagement unit (to map virtual memory addresses into real memory addresses).andO;The 68030 chips used in the SE/30, IIx, CX and CI include built-in memorymanagement capabilities.andP;  The 68020-based MAc II has a socket for an optionalPMMU chip.andP;  These chips are currently selling for not much over $200.andM;The 68000-based Macs (Plus, SE and Portable) do not support a PMMU chip andthus will not support virtual memory.andP;  This (and the large memory addressspace discussed below) are the only System 7 functions that &quot;lesser&quot; Macswill not support.andM;Large address space.andP;  Virtual memory brings with it the need to address hugeamounts of memory.andP;  Running on a 32-bit machine (68020 or higher), System 7will address up to 128 MB of RAM and 4 GB of addressable memory.andM;'32-bit clean'andM;The Mac must use full 32-bit memory addressing to access this much memory.andO;System 7 therefore expects that all application software will be &quot;32-bitclean.&quot;andP;  Some existing applications are tied to the old 24-bit systemsoftware architecture, which used high-order bits for other purposes.andP;  (Theprime offenders are custom controls--popup menus, sliders and so on--writtenby application developers.)andP;  These programs will have to be modified to rununder System 7.andM;However, we should note that even though we played with early alpha System 7software in our most recent visit to Apple, we were able to run a surprisingnumber of existing applications without incident.andP;  (Apple has been tellingdevelopers for more than a year to get ready for the 32-bit world.)andP;  Weshould also note that &quot;32-bit clean&quot; software will run on any Macintosh andshould work fine on System 6 machines as well as System 7 machines.andM;Outline fontsandM;System 7 will, of course, include support for Apple's Royal outline fontformat.andP;  If a precomputed bitmap exists for the typeface/size combinationrequested, the system software will use that.andP;  If not, it will compute therequired bitmap from the character outline.andM;So far, the only Royal fonts we have seen have not included the scalinginstructions required to produce good-looking screen bitmaps at text sizes.andO;As you would expect, fonts that do not include these instructions look prettyratty at small sizes.andP;  We are still anxious to see how much work it will beto generate the Royal instructions required for on-the-fly generation ofgood-quality screen bitmaps from small-sized type.andM;We can tell you, however, that we have now seen printer output of Royal fontsand that this looks encouraging.andM;Adebe fonts and PostScript printers.andP;  We believe that Apple now recognizesthat it must accommodate Adobeformat fonts as well as Adobe PostScriptprinters.andP;  The result, we believe, will be Adobe ATM software for System 7and Apple software that allows Royal-format fonts to run on Adobe PostScriptprinters.andM;In short, we expect that Macintosh users will be able to intermixRoyal-format fonts and Adobe-format fonts on their Macs, QuickDraw printersand Adobe PostScript printers and typesetters.andM;Inter-application communicationandM;We believe that interprocess or inter-application communication will be oneof the most important system developments of the 1990s.andP;  It will bring afundamental change in the way both developers and users view applicationsoftware.andM;Inter-application communication will allow us to think of applicationprograms as modular building blocks that can be combined in differentfashions to serve particular user application requirements:andM;* One application program can call others to perform certain services.andP;  Theresult can be a coordinated ensemble of programs tailored to the needs of aparticular application in a way that no single multifunction mass-marketprogram is likely to enable.andM;* One application program will be able to control and direct otherapplication programs.andM;This will, we believe, encourage development of more focused or morespecialized application programs.andP;  There will be real incentive to producethe best modular building blocks that can be combined with other buildingblocks to create targeted application solutions.andM;In addition, interprocess links will provide the foundation that allows usersto create documents that contain live data from other documents--evendocuments that have been created using a different application.andM;Apple implementation.andP;  Apple's implementation of these interprocess andinter-application concepts looks to be particularly rich and promising.andP;  Atthe base level, there are system protocols for process-to-processcommunication.andP;  These protocols provide the &quot;delivery mechanism&quot; that allowsone program to communicate with another.andM;Apple Events.andP;  One top of this are sets of standardized nouns and verbs thatcan be used in messages sent from one program to another.andP;  Apple has definedeight categories of Events: Basic, Common, Text, Calc, Finder, Database,Graphics and Presentation.andP;  These will be published so that applicationdevelopers can write their programs to issue, recognize and respond to AppleEvents.andM;It is entirely likely that the core set of defined events will be expandedover time as application software developers invent additional nouns andverbs and as Apple adds messages to the approved set.andM;AppleScript.andP;  Apple has also developed a programming language that can beused to prepare fairly elaborate sets of commands to be sent from one programto another.andP;  The AppleScript language is essentially an adaptation of theHyperScript language used for HyperCard.andP;  This means that there alreadyexists a huge base of users and developers who are already experienced inprogramming in the language.andM;In addition, apple is providing &quot;programming by example&quot; facilities that willrecord a series of user actions as AppleScript statements.andP;  The resultingscript can then be edited to modify it, refine it, or to add things such asconditional statements that cannot be easily programmed by example.andM;Implications.andP;  We expect that MAcintosh software developers will embrace theApple Events concept.andP;  It provides a consistent means for appliation programsto talk with each other.andP;  The possibilities are limited only by yourimagination.andP;  Claris, for example, has a neat demonstration in which placingtables, desks or chairs on a furniture floorplan running in Claris CADautomatically updates a FileMaker database with an associated orderform/invoice.andM;In the future, it should be possible to link applications from differentvendors in a similar fashion.andM;Edition Manager.andP;  The same basic facilities make it possible to include allor part of one document in other documents.andP;  System 7 includes an &quot;EditionManager&quot; that allows any user to &quot;publish&quot; any portion of a document.andP;  Otherusers can then &quot;subscribe&quot; to the published data and include it in their owndocuments.andP;  (The commands &quot;publish&quot; and &quot;subscribe to&quot; have been added to the&quot;File&quot; command menu.)andP;  A user could, for example, select a portion of adrawing and &quot;publish&quot; it.andP;  A second user could include this published elementin another drawing.andP;  A third user could include the same published element asa graphic in a page of text.andM;As long as the link is maintained, whenever the published original isupdated, the subscriber views will be updated as well.andP;  We understand that itwill also be possible to break the link (so that changes to the original willnot be made to the subscriber view), and to update the link only on demand(so that you could include the then-current version of a drawing in adocument only when you issue a new revision of that document).andM;Network-wide.andP;  All of this, of course, works across an Apple AFP network.andO;Programs can communicate with or even control other programs on differentMacs on the network.andP;  A change to a published element can automaticallyupdate five, fifteen or fifty MAcs elsewhere on the netowrk that happen tohave open a document that includes a live subscriber view of that element.andM;File sharingandM;This kind of Mac-to-Mac communication implies a peer-to-peer communicationcapability that Apple has never provided before.andP;  In fact, System 7 foldswhat appears to be full AppleShare server functionality into the Findersoftware on every Mac.andM;The protocols and the excellent access security are exactly as before.andP;  Theprincipal difference is that under System 7 AppleShare no longer requires adedicated Macintosh server.andP;  Any Macintosh user on the network can publishany folder or collection of folders on his disk.andP;  When he does so, hespecifies what groups or individuals he wishes to have access to the materialhe is making available.andM;Once he has done this, any user with the proper access privileges can viewand open the folders and files across the network from his desktop.andM;This provides a great deal of flexibility for the user.andP;  He can still, if hechooses, dedicate one or more Macs for use as file servers, simply leavingthem turned on with no one using them.andP;  But he can also share files betweenindividual Macs whether or not he has a dedicated file server.andM;The good.andP;  This will undoubtedly make appleShare file sharing much moreattractive to smaller shops that have been reluctant to spring for adedicated file server.andP;  It will also provide added flexibility even for shopsthat already have dedicated Macs for use as file servers.andM;We would expect that many all-Macintosh sites that are currently using Topspeer-to-peer network software may well move to the facilities built intoSystem 7 instead.andP;  We are less certain about mixed Mac/PC shops.andP;  The currentAppleShare PC software takes up a fair amount of precious PC memory and doesnot allow the PC to be a file server.andM;The bad.andP;  We are impressed with the new file sharing capability.andP;  AppleShareis, by far, the easiest desktop computer network to set up and administer.andO;System 7 will make it even easier and more flexible.andP;  But we still want more.andM;We are waiting for the &quot;industrial-strength&quot; capabilities: data integrityeven when the server is hit with a power failure, automatic database backup,dual (mirror) recording on two disks at the same time, remote dial-in access,integrated electronic mail, better support for PCs.andP;  True, 3Com and Novellcan proide many of these capabilities, but both have been slow to get fullapple AFP support, and neither system is as easy to install and manage asAppleShare.andM;What we really want is the combination of AppleShare ease of use andindustrial-strength capabilities.andM;Finder 7andM;As noted above, file sharing is part of the new Finder software.andP;  Finder 7provides a lot of other nice features as well.andP;  Most of these will beimportant only to Macintosh users.andP;  But taken together they represent thekind of ongoing refinement that, thus far, has kept the Macintosh ahead ofits newer graphic user interface competition.andM;Some of the features of Finder 7 include:andM;* The ability to install anything (including fonts, sounds and deskaccessories) by simply dragging it to the proper folder.andM;* Removing the important distinctions between desk accessories andapplication programs.andP;  Programs can now be listed in the &quot;Apple&quot; menu.andP;  Deskaccessories, in effect, now become just another kind of program and aretreated as such.andP;  Frankly, the only reason we can see for anyone to developnew Macintosh desk accessories is to be able to run them on old (System 6)Macintosh systems.andP;  If you are writing software to run on System 7, it wouldbe simpler to write it as a normal Macintosh program without the constraintsimposed by making it a desk accessory.andM;* Improvements to the handling of windows on the desktop:andM;a) The &quot;zoom&quot; command enlarges the window just enough to display all of thefolders it contains, rather than blindly expanding it to fill the entirescreen.andM;b) New commands will reduce screen clutter by hiding windows that are notrelevant to the application program currently in use and bringing a specificwindow to the top of the desktop pile.andM;c) It is now easy to drag a file or folder from one window to another, evenif the source window hides the destination window.andM;d) The window display will scroll automatically when you select a group offolders that extends beyond the displayable window.andM;* File copy is now a background function.andP;  You no longer have to sit andstare at a dialog box when you copy something.andM;* A &quot;help&quot; command has been added to the command bar at the top of thescreen.andP;  This means that help files can be made available, at all times, andthat help can be called in a consistent fashion.andM;* A &quot;Find&quot; facility has been added to the base system software.andP;  Like the&quot;Find File&quot; desk accessory, this will locate files whose names contain theword(s) you specify.andP;  However, unlike Find File, once you have located thefiles, Find allows you to operate on them.andM;* Access to file info.andP;  The Macintosh file system has always provided a blankinformation field that can contain information about a file.andP;  The new Findfacility will provide the ability to locate and select files based on thetext that appears in this field.andP;  We would encourage enterprising applicationsoftware developers to seize this as a way to add to the Macintosh filesystem the kind of status information dedicated publishing systems havealways provided.andP;  It should be possible to use this field to record suchinformation as file status; who has edited and/or reviewed the file; topicinformation; what volume, chapter, edition, and/or page the file belongs to;its depth; and a host of other things that help users manage the publishingprocess.andM;AliasesandM;This is a another feature of the new Finder, but we think that it is soimportant that we have listed it separately.andP;  Basically, an &quot;alias&quot; is asmall file that refers to any Finder object.andP;  Aliases will have a thousandand one uses.andP;  Here are a few samples:andM;* If you want to place a folder or a file residing on some other Macintosh onthe network on your desktop, you simply create a little &quot;alias&quot; file thatreferences the folder or file you wish to access.andP;  When you click on thealias, the system will automatically go out across the network and fetch thefolder or file you want.andM;* You can create multiple aliases for the same file or folder and place themin multiple locations.andP;  This allows you to organize information in differentfashions.andM;* You can create a library of aliases for all the files and folders you wantto archive onto floppy disk or removable cartridges.andP;  Once you have archivedthe originals, delete them from your local disk, but keep the aliases.andP;  (Analias file takes up approximately 500 bytes of storage.)andM;When you click on the alias, the system will tell you which archive disk tomount.andP;  Once you have inserted the disk, the file or folder will be openedautomatically.andM;Database Access ManagerandM;Apple is also building into System 7 its CL/1-based Database Access Manager.andO;By including this in the system software, Apple is guaranteeing to allsoftware developers that all system 7 Macs will have this facility.andM;The job of the Database Access Manager is to link the Macintosh to virtuallyany external database server.andP;  The application software running in theMacintosh communicates with the Macintosh Database Access Manager CL/1 Clientsoftware.andP;  This communicates with CL/1 Server software running in the host.andO;Apple says that the Macintosh program should not have to know or care whattype of network is being used, what computer is serving as the databaseserver, or even what database application software is running in the server.andO;As long as the server software provides a CL/1 interface, the differences aresupposed to be transparent to both the Mac application software and the user.andM;Apple says that Acius, Ashton-Tate, Blyth, Informix, Neuron Data, Odesta andOracle will all provide CL/1 servers that will work with the Apple CL/1Client.andP;  Most of the serers are running some variation of SQL, but this isnot a prerequisite.andP;  It is also possible to translate CL/1 commands into thecommands required by a number of NON-SQL database servers.andM;MultitaskingandM;Apple System 7 extends the System 6 Multifinder capabilities by makingMultifinder standard.andP;  Because most Macs still have 1 MB of memory, System 6boots up with Multifinder turned off.andP;  The user has to deliberately turnMultifinder on in order to use it.andP;  (It rarely makes sense to turn it onunless you have 2 MB or more of memory.)andM;Because System 7 requires 2 MB of memory, System 7 will not have the optionof running with Multifinder turned off.andP;  Multifinder is an integral part ofSystem 7.andM;What you get.andP;  Multifinder allows the user to launch as many programs as willfit in the memory available.andP;  Each program occupies its own portion ofmemory.andP;  As a minimum, System 7 users will always have the finder (Macintoshdesktop) plus one application program running.andP;  This means that the desktopfacilities are always available, even when you are in the middle of using anapplication program.andP;  Multifinder users generally use the desktop facilitiesto move and rename files while they are still in the application program.andM;Most often, a Multifinder user will have several application programs loadedat all times, and will jump between them at will.andM;Background processing.andP;  Multifinder also allows you to run tasks in thebackground while you work on something else in the foreground.andP;  Applesupports background printing to the LaserWriter (but not to dot-matrix orinkjet printers).andP;  Many communication programs can send or receive files inthe background.andP;  Excel can perorm lengthy spreadsheet calculations in thebackground.andM;But the Macintosh does not support full pre-emptive multitasking.andP;  When aMacintosh program is running it has complete, undisputed control of thecomputer until it surfaces and looks for instructions on what to do next.andO;(The program must call the &quot;GetNextEvent&quot; system routine to check for mouseclicks, keyboard keystrokes or other actions that will tell the program whatto do next.)andM;A Macintosh program or task can be set up to run as a background task if ithas been crafted to surface frequently and issue a GetNextEvent command everyfew milliseconds.andP;  At this point, and only at this point, some otherforeground program can take control of the computer.andP;  When the foregroundprogram momentarily runs out of things to do, the background program willstart back up again and will continue to run until the next GetNextEvent.andP;  Ifno one grabs control of the computer away from it, it will continue fromGetNextEvent to GetNextEvent until it is interrupted or it finishes its task.andM;A software developer who wants his program to be able to run in thebackground on a Macintoh will have to decide how frequently the program willsurface to check for events.andP;  The more often it does this, the slower theprogram will run, but the more quickly it will relinquish the computer to aforeground task.andM;It is fairly easy to see the consequences of this trade-off decision.andO;Background printing to a LaserWriter on a Macintosh II will have a noticeableeffect on interactive foreground operations such as moving the cursor andtyping text.andP;  But on the faster Mac IICI, the delays are far less noticeable.andO;The CI gets through instructions faster and thus gets to the nextGetNextEvent more quickly.andM;What do users want?andP;  Full preemptive multitasking would allow the foregroundprogram to interrupt the background task whenever it wanted.andP;  This wouldallow users to run any program in the background, not just ones that had beenspecially designed for this.andP;  Because foreground tasks would not have to waitfor the background task to get around to checking for an event, it would alsoreduce the apparent impact that background processing has on foregroundtasks.andM;However, the way the Macintosh and Macintosh software works makes it verydifficult to interrupt a Macintosh application program at any arbitrarymillisecond.andP;  (For one thing, many Mac applications keep a private clipboard,which is supposed to be converted to the standard system clipboard wheneverthe application is suspended.andP;  As a rule, only the application that ismaintaining the private data knows how to convert it; merely stopping aprogram in its tracks and giving control to another program would interferewith cutting and pasting data between applications.)andP;  For this reason, Applehas chosen to support a courteous form of multitasking in which one programvoluntarily relinquishes control to another.andM;Apple believes that this approach provides users most of what they want(primarily, the ability to switch quickly between foreground applicationprograms and to run I/O tasks and long jobs in the background) while stillpreserving the ability to run current Macintosh software.andP;  We think thatregardless of the technical difficulties, Apple will be under increasingpressure to provide full pre-emptive multitasking.andM;The new interprocess communications and scripting capabilities are sure toprovide some of this pressure.andP;  Interprocess communication makes the mostsense when the processes are actually running concurrently (whether in theforeground or the background) and can respond quickly to requests.andM;Some initial reactionsandM;Apple is fond of contrasting the turmoil that the MS-DOS, OS/2 and Unixworlds are going through with Apple's logical evolution.andP;  We think it shouldprobably add that it is walking both users and software developers into thefuture at a pace that both can absorb and understand.andP;  Based on what we haveseen thus far, we are optimistic that Apple will meet its schedule for System7, and that users will like what they get.andP;  The un-canned demonstration wehad at Apple included every model of MAcintosh running on a common network, amixture of System 6 and System 7 machines sharing common files and commonperipherals, and a fair number of application programs, most of whichappeared to run on the alpha release System 7 software.andM;We are axious to get our hands on System 7 and begin to explore all of thenuances.andP;  We would also like to encourage software developers to build insupport for Apple Events.andP;  We think that users are going to be very impressedwith the kinds of things the InterApplication Communication Architectureallows you do do.andM;Although we would really like full pre-emptive multitasking, we canunderstand how difficult it would be for Apple to provide it.andP;  We are lesssympathetic about the slow progress of Apple's networking solutions.andO;Although the peer-to-peer AppleShare facilities are very welcome, we hadreally hoped to see more industrial-strength capabilities by this time--alongwith lower-cost support for Ethernet and other high-speed networks.andM;In general, though, we think that Mac partisans will be delighted with System7--especially since it runs across such a broad range of machines.andP;  Given thecurrent price of a megabyte of memory, we think that most Mac users will wantto upgrade all of the machines they can.andM;After many promises and delays, it looks as if this year will be the year thethe desktop computing environments for the '90s begin to take shape in themarket.andP;  We expect to have some lively times debating and handicappingMacintosh System 7 vs.andP;  Microsoft Windows 3.0 vs.andP;  OS/2 vs.andP;  NextStep, andNextStep vs.andP;  Sun Unix vs.andP;  OSF Motif.andP;  It should be an interesting year!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
