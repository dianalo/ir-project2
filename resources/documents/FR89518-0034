Cost containment is not to be interpreted as acceptingpoor design or cheap construction. Projects must provide the features andamenities necessary for the lifestyles of the tenants and members. Costcontainment challenges us to consider the cost/benefit ratio when evaluating,recommending or requiring specific design features or construction techniques.The following guidelines should be followed when developing projects: <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(8) When evaluating projects, life cycle costs will be considered.

Thefollowing forms of management will be recognized for cooperative housing.(i) Self-management. The primary management objective for small housingcooperative. To achieve this, education and training efforts should bean on-going part of their early years of operation. Accordingly, modesteducational costs will be permitted in the budget as a subheading undermanagement expenses. It is understood that, in the beginning, it may benecessary to obtain some outside services, such as a bookkeeper. If so,then partial self-management can be considered. (ii) Partial self-management. Certain management and/or supervisory servicescontracted from a technical service organization, housing authority, ormanagement firm, etc. If this additional assistance does not enable thecooperative to manage itself, then the ultimate solution will have to becontract management. (iii) Contract management. Professional services contracted for the day-to-daysupervision of cooperative operations. The board of directors would developthe policies which would then be administered by the management agent.(h) <T3>Cooperative membership fee.</T3> Cooperative housing is a form of homeownership.In order to promote a commitment from prospective members, cooperativeswill require a membership fee. The membership fee established by the boardof directors will be equal to one month's occupancy charge. Once the feehas been established, that amount will be uniformly applied to all members.Members unable to pay a cash membership fee should be permitted to makemonthly payments without interest, until the membership fee is paid; however,a cash payment of at least $25 should be required at occupancy. The periodof payment on the membership fee should not exceed 12 months. (i) <T3>Cooperative limited equity.</T3>  (1) RCH loans will only be made tocooperatives which limit the accumulation of equity. The limitations aredesigned to maintain unit availability for low-income people. In addition,all prospective members must have received, prior to becoming an actualmember, a statement of the objectives of the cooperative, debts and a declarationdescribing limited equity and what it will mean to them. Exhibit H of thissubpart will be used for this purpose. (2) Inflation equity which accrues on cooperative property is not consideredpart of members' limited equity and will not be taken from the projectwhen a member vacates the project. (j) * * *(2) RA may be provided to eligible tenants and members in eligible projectsin accordance with Exhibit E to Subpart C of Part 1930 of this chapter.(3) At least 95 percent of RA units available for newly constructed projectsmust be used to assist very low-income tenants and members.

Introduction </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. Most areas in rural America need more adequate rental housing.Some people with modest incomes live in impoverished housing that is coldin the winter and hot in the summer because adequate housing at a reasonablerent is not available. Other households that prefer to rent have the choiceof either commuting many miles to work or living in the substandard rentalhousing that is available in small rural communities. To help reduce thisrental housing shortage, the Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) financesrental housing in rural communities. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. To augment the choice of living accommodations available to modestincome persons, FmHA also provides financing for cooperative-type housingunits. Although this kind of housing unit is appropriate only to a particulargroup of persons, it also serves to help reduce the existing housing shortagein rural communities. Nonprofit organizations, other types of organizationsand individuals may qualify for these housing loans. Information aboutthe loans is available at the local FmHA office. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. This handbook will assist interested persons and groups in applyingfor a rural rental or cooperative housing loan. It also briefly explainsrequirements regarding the construction and operation of the housing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. The basic guidelines in this handbook apply to all applicants;however, some requirements will vary depending on the size of the projectand whether the applicant is a nonprofit organization, other type of organization,an individual, or a nonprofit cooperative. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">E. The objective of the FmHA housing loan program is to provide creditfor housing that serves the needs of eligible very low-, low-, and moderate-incomepermanent residents. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">F. Successful housing depends on the existence of the following threeimportant conditions: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. There must be a need for the housing to be built. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The housing must fit the needs of prospective tenants or cooperativemembers from the standpoint of location, design and cost. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. The applicant must provide good management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">G. An applicant for a loan must provide adequate information to FmHAto show that these basic conditions can be met. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">II. Applying for a Loan </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. An individual, organization or group organizing to provide housingmay apply for an RRH loan through the local FmHA District Director servingthe area where the housing will be located. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The applicant should read FmHA Instruction 1944-E before applyingfor a loan. The applicant also should discuss the proposed housing withthe District Director before completing a preapplication. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. Applying for a loan begins with a ``Preapplication for FederalAssistance'' on Form AD-621. Included with the preapplication form shouldbe the supporting material or information listed in Exhibit A-7. This informationwill enable FmHA to determine: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The eligibility of the applicant; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. The feasibility (economic, environmental and architectural) ofthe proposed housing; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. That prospective cooperative members have read and understand theirresponsibilities as outlined in What is Cooperative Housing? before agreeingto a cooperative housing project. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The suitability of prospective members to cooperative life; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. Whether the proposed housing can appropriately be financed by FmHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">D. This information usually can be furnished by the applicant withouthiring extensive professional services. It should be factual and specificbased on objective investigations and realistic estimates. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">III. Review of the Preapplication </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. If the proposal exceeds the District Director's approval authority,he/she will submit the docket to the FmHA State Director for consideration.If the proposal exceeds the State Director's approval authority, he/shewill send the docket, including comments and recommendations of the Districtand State Office staffs, to the FmHA National Office in Washington, DCfor review. All cooperative housing proposals will be sent to the NationalOffice for review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The completeness and accuracy of information submitted with thepreapplication is especially important when reviews are necessary by FmHAoffices remote to the proposed site  and without direct knowledge of conditionsand circumstances involved with the project. The description of the plannedhousing must be clear, complete and concise to ensure timely reviews byFmHA. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C. When the reviews are completed, the District Director will notifythe applicant, using Form AD-622, ``Notice of Review of PreapplicationAction,'' of FmHA's decision. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If it appears a loan can be made, the District Director will explainthe additional steps that will be required. If favorable action cannotbe taken on the preapplication, the District Director will explain whyand may be able to suggest changes to permit a loan to be made. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">IV. Developng the Loan Docket </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A. When an applicant is authorized to submit a formal application,the District Director will review the items required in Exhibit A-8. Theamount of information required will vary based on the complexity and sizeof the proposed project. The District Director will also provide formsand guides to assist the applicant in recording required information. Someof the guides are included as exhibits in this handbook. The applicantis responsible for providing the information required. The District Directorwill assemble this information and complete the docket.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. The following information will be helpful in developing a loandocket. The first two items are applicable only to nonprofit organizations.The other items apply to any applicant. In addition, the requirements ofExhibit A-7 of this instruction must be met when developing a preapplicationand the requirements of Exhibit A-9 must be met when developing an application.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. <T3>Getting organized if applicant is a nonprofit organization and hasnot adopted articles of incorporation and bylaws. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. <T3>Steering committee or sponsor. </T3>The group may choose a steeringcommittee or, in the case of a cooperative, a sponsor to act for it. Anattorney will usually be required to advise the organization on incorporationand assist in developing the loan application. The steering committee,or sponsor, should select an attorney who is interested in the proposedhousing and will render the necessary services promptly for a reasonablefee. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. <T3>Articles of incorporation and bylaws. </T3>FmHA has developed modelarticles of incorporation and bylaws for nonprofit organizations. The steeringcommittee, or sponsor, should arrange for the District Director to meetwith the attorney. The District Director will give the attorney copiesof the FmHA model articles of incorporation and bylaws and explain FmHArequirements. Separate bylaws have been developed for cooperatives andfor rental housing organizations. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. <T3>Attorney's fees. </T3>Reasonable attorney's fees may be included inthe FmHA loan. A written agreement between the applicant and attorney isrequired. See Exhibit A-1 for a sample copy of an agreement. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. <T3>Board of directors. </T3>The steering committee, or sponsor, usuallyselects the incorporators for the corporation. The board of directors isresponsible for conducting the corporation's business, including obtainingthe loan and providing overall management after the housing is completed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Obtaining broadly based membership for rental housing. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A nonprofit corporation applying for a loan must have and maintaina broadly based local membership, including leaders in the community, representinga variety of interests in the community. The members may be individualsor organizations but each member is limited to one vote. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The purpose of the broadly based membership requirement is to obtaincommunity support, provide enough members to be able to rotate officersand members of the board of directors, protect the Government's financialinterest as mortgagee and provide assurance that the housing will be asuccess and the purpose of the loan carried out. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. In RRH loans made to nonprofit organizations and public bodies,there is no profit incentive. The term of the loan may be for as long as50 years. Therefore, factors such as the prospect for continuous competentmanagement and supervision, maintenance and adequate community supportof the housing project over the expected life of the loan are important.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. A membership list showing the names and addresses of each membershould be maintained by the secretary of the organization.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) <T3>Number of members required. </T3>The organization should have at least25 members. The number of members may be decreased for projects with lessthan 25 units. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) <T3>Contributions by members. </T3>Nonprofit corporations may require amembership fee or ask prospective members for a contribution. This is themethod often used by nonprofit corporation applicants to raise initialoperating capital. However, no such fee or contribution can entitle a memberor prospective member to a preference in occupancy of the housing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Cooperative membership. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Only those persons who will reside in the cooperative housing willbe members of the cooperative. The composition of the board of directorswill be drawn from that membership, initially by appointment and laterby election from the general membership. The board should be composed ofat least 5 members. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The board of directors, with assistance from the adviser to theboard (discussed in a later section), will devise the rules and regulationsunder which the cooperative will operate. Additionally, the board willbe responsible for management of the cooperative. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. A membership list showing the names and addresses of each memberwill be maintained by the secretary of the cooperative. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">d. Cooperative membership will require the deposit of a membershipfee by each member as outlined in andSection; 1944.215(h) of this subpart.The fee will be retained by the cooperative for as long as the person remainsa member of the cooperative. The fee will be refunded to the person whenmembership is terminated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. The applicant should communicate with officials of the communityearly in the development of the proposal to explain the benefits of theproposed housing to the community. This meeting will serve to remove theuncertainty of the impact of the housing on the community and may aid ina timely processing of the preapplication. The support of community officialsis helpful in obtaining environmental clearances, possible zoning changes,favorable taxation, etc. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">5. <T3>Initial operating capital. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. All applicants must have enough initial operating capital to getstarted. When justified, FmHA may include these funds in a loan made toa nonprofit organization or public body. Initial operating capital shouldbe sufficient to pay such costs as property and liability insurance premiums,fidelity bond premiums when the applicant is an organization, utility hook-upcharges and deposits, maintenance and other equipment, lease forms, furnishings,loan payments that may become due during construction and other initialexpenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. At least 2 percent of the total development cost of the projectis required for initial operation and maintenance costs. The applicantcan determine the amount required by working out a detailed budget of incomeand expenses for the period of time until the housing is ready for occupancyand rental income will be available. The actual budget may indicate thatmore than 2 percent is needed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. <T3>Analysis of market to determine demand for rental housing. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Applicants should discuss with the District Director the type ofmarket analysis that will be needed. Applicants must comply with paragraphII of Exhibit A-7 when preparing market information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Exhibits A-2 and A-3 are sample forms which may be modified bythe applicant to assist in the assembly of the information for the marketanalysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. <T3>Planning to serve the market. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Planning the housing to serve the market in the community involvesmore than obtaining a blueprint of the building. It requires a carefulevaluation of conditions in the community and careful planning to assurethat the result will be good rental housing designed for independent livingat a cost eligible tenant persons can afford. Well planned housing is:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Convenient, attractive, safe and comfortable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Easily maintained. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Located where tenants or members can have easy access to the goodsand services they require for daily living. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Planned to meet all codes, regulations, and acceptable constructionpractices. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Priced to rent for no more than the prospective tenants can affordto pay. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) Priced within an affordable range of its prospective tenants andmembers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Energy efficient and complies with FmHA's thermal performancestandards. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The District Director and State Office architect can provide informationthat will help the applicant in planning the housing. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Selecting an architect. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The services of an architect are required for all housing projectswhich have more than five units. The cost of a registered architect/engineermay be included in the loan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Before anything more than schematic drawings are prepared, theapplicant and its architect, the FmHA architect/engineer and the DistrictDirector should arrange a meeting. This meeting will acquaint the applicant'sarchitect with the purposes of the housing and FmHA's requirements. Thiswill be helpful in eliminating misunderstandings. Among the topics thatshould be discussed are: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Objectives of the rental housing program. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Design requirements that will produce good housing at reasonablecost. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Stages at which FmHA must review plans and specifications. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Services the architect will be expected to perform. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Agreement between architect and applicant.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">9. Selecting a site . </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The location of the housing is an important art of planning toserve the market. Tenants. Occupants should have easy access to requiredservices. A desirable residential setting within a rural community is essential.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Site cost is also important. The total cost of the site, includingthe cost of improvements and the price of the land, must be considered.Both may be included in the loan. However, loan funds made available topurchase land may not exceed the present market value of the land in itspresent condition as determined by an FmHA appraisal. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Before buying a site, the applicant should consult the architectto determine the suitability of the site for the proposed housing. Theapplicant must consider the site requirements detailed in paragraph 111of Exhibit A-7 of this instruction. The applicant should not enter intoany firm agreement to buy a site with the expectation of receiving an FmHAloan without consulting with the District Director and prior to the Agency'scompletion of the environmental impact review. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">10. Drawings, specifications and cost estimates. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The size, complexity and cost of rental housing projects can varyfrom a duplex located on a small building lot to a complex of buildingslocated on a site containing several acres. The applicant must providedrawings and specifications in accordance with paragraph IV of ExhibitA-7 of this instruction. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">11. Budgets. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The initial budget should cover the period from the date the firstconstruction expenses are incurred until the end of the applicant's firstfiscal year following completion of the housing. After the final cost estimatehas been made and the amount of the loan needed has been determined, abudget for a typical year should be developed. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. This budget should be based on a typical annual operation afterthe project is occupied. Budgeting is an important part of the management.The applicant should spend enough time working on it to assure that theestimates are realistic. Budgets will be required each year until the FmHAloan is repaid in full. The budget serves several purposes including: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Helps determine rental or occupancy rates. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Indicates financial soundness. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Serves as a guide for paying expenses. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. Form FmHA 1930-7, ``Statement of Budget and Cash Flow,'' and itsaccompanying Exhibit A-6 are a sample budget form and utility allowanceform. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">12. Loan resolution or loan agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When the applicant is a corporation or an individual applying fora loan above certain amounts, a copy of the required loan resolution orloan agreement should be obtained from and discussed with the DistrictDirector before the loan docket is developed. Among other things, thisdocument outlines how the income from the housing is to be used. Theserequirements should be understood at the time the budget is developed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">13. Rental management plan.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">A detailed management plan will be developed which will outline thebasic policies and procedures to be followed and the duties of the officersand employees. The applicant must manage the project in accordance withthe requirements of Subpart C to Part 1930 (FmHA Instruction 1930-C). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">14. Rental manager and caretaker. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. A comprehensive management program is essential to the successfuloperation of the project. A carefully written plan should be developedin accordance with Exhibit B of FmHA Instruction 1930-E. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. The use of an onsite manager should be based on the size of theproject. The manager should be readily available to the tenants. The managermight be one of the tenants or a member of the board of directors of anonprofit corporation. The manager's duties should be specified in themanagement plan. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. The board of directors of a corporation is responsible for overallsupervision and management of all its affairs. The board should delegateactual operating and management responsibility to committees or individualsand meet often enough to see that enterprise is being managed successfully.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">15. Cooperative self-management. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. The success of cooperative housing will depend on how well themembers are able to manage the cooperative themselves with assistance fromthe adviser to the board. The cooperative must first develop and designatethose areas of responsibilities to be delegated to committees, a list ofthe committees, and the functions of the committees. A copy of this informationwill be provided to each prospective member. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Participation on committees by members will be on a voluntary basis.However, if it appears a committee does not have sufficient numbers forit to adequately operate, then additional members will be expected to volunteertheir time and talents. Thus, participation on committees is voluntaryup to a point. If a member has experience in a particular area, that membershould be encouraged to join the committee which will benefit from his/herexperience. The cooperative will need a total commitment from the membershipin order to assure success of self-management. Examples of the types ofcommittees which may be considered are:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(1) Maintenance </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(2) Groundskeeping </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(3) Communications </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(4) Budget and finance </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(5) Rules </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(6) Recreation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="25">(7) Home service</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c. If the cooperative is not successful in managing itself, professionalmanagement will be hired by the cooperative. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">16. Occupancy policies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">a. Applicants should review carefully the occupancy requirements withthe District Director. Particular attention should be given to the followingrequirements: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The housing must be open to all eligible tenants persons regardlessof race, color, religion sex, National origin, age, handicap or maritalstatus. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The incomes of tenants and the initial incomes of cooperativemembers must be within the maximum income limits approved by FmHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">b. Additional guidance concerning occupancy in congregate housingprojects can be found in Exhibits B-10 and B-10A to Subpart C of Part 1930(FmHA Instruction 1930-C). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">17. Cooperative board of directors. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The board will essentially be the backbone of the cooperative structure.In this capacity it will be responsible for establishing the policies andprocedures which will govern the operation of the cooperative and for enforcingthose policies and procedures. The board will be composed of members ofthe cooperative with the same interests and concerns as the general membership.For instance, instituting an increase in the occupancy rates or terminatinga member's right to cooperative ownership because of serious repeated violationsof cooperative rules and regulations will be the types of actions whichare taken by the board. The members of the board will be affected by thesesame decisions since they must adhere to the same rules and regulationsas the rest of the cooperative community. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">18. Adviser to the board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Resident(s) of the community who is not a member of the cooperativewill serve as an adviser to the board during the period of formation anduntil the board of directors has effectively demonstrated its ability tomanage the cooperative. At that time, the adviser will maintain close contactwith the cooperative and provide advice and assistance as needed. The adviserwill closely monitor the cooperative for at least 2 years after it becomesits own manager. This time may vary, depending on the circumstances. Theadviser must be very carefully selected to ensure that adequate guidanceis given to the board. The adviser must be able to meet certain criteriain order to provide the best possible counsel. The Qualifications for anAdviser to the Board, the Adviser Responsibilities, and Relationship ofAdviser to Members, found at Exhibits E, E-1, and F of this subpart, shouldbe used in evaluating potential advisers. While it may not be possibleto find some one individual or individuals who can meet all the requirementsoutlined, the criteria should be used as guides in determining the bestcandidate. FmHA will provide counsel to the cooperative during the interviewperiod and must approve the selection of the individual(s). We recognizethe adviser will require compensation for services rendered, however, theamount paid should not severely limit the amount of patronage capital accruingto the members.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">19. Management reserve. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The board's ability to manage the cooperative will determine whethermembers will receive equity from membership in the cooperative. A set ratefor professional management will be assessed each month as part of theoccupancy rate and will be maintained in a separate reserve account. Ifthe cooperative is successful at managing its own affairs during the year,the amount accumulated in the reserve will be assigned equally to eachmember at the end of the year as patronage capital. This same procedurewill be followed each year, allowing a buildup of patronage capital. Ifprofessional management is hired by the cooperative to correct deficiencieswhich have arisen from poor self-management, further accumulations to themanagement account will then be used to pay for professional managementand the amount being accrued to the members' patronage capital accountwill be suspended. If the amount being accumulated for management is notsufficient to meet the needs, occupancy rates will be increased to coverthe expense of management. When the cooperative begins to again manageitself, the assessment for the management reserve will resume as previouslystated. Any other income remaining at the end of the year will also beassigned as patronage capital. Assignment from both of these sources mustbe accomplished in accordance with the IRS ruling concerning patronagedistribution. FmHA rental assistance proceeds are not to be used to makethe member's contribution to the management reserve account. Therefore,the member must have sufficient income from which to make this payment.If it becomes necessary to hire full-time professional management, thenthe management fee will be considered part of the shelter cost and thuseligible for RA. FmHA will assist the adviser to the board in determiningif and when professional management will be hired in lieu of self-management.In the event the adviser and FmHA are unable to reach an agreement regardingthe hiring of professional management, the ultimate decision will restwith FmHA. Compensation paid to the adviser will be shared by members throughthe deduction of equal amounts from their management reserve payments.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">20.
