Background</ITAG>The current 24 CFR Part 3500, also known as Regulation X, was issued onJune 4, 1976. It covers most provisions of the Real Estate Settlement ProceduresAct of 1974 (RESPA) (Pub. L. 93-533), as amended by the Real Estate SettlementProcedures Act Amendments of 1975 (Pub. L. 94-205).RESPA contains certain disclosure requirements and restrictions for settlementsinvolving ``Federally related mortgage loans.'' Most sales of one- to four-familyresidential buildings involve Federally related mortgage loans. For RESPA-coveredtransactions, a lender must provide to a loan applicant a special informationbooklet and good faith estimate of certain settlement charges. One dayprior to settlement, the person conducting the settlement must, if requested,provide the borrower with a HUD-prescribed settlement statement, knownas the HUD-1 settlement statement, completed with information on settlementcosts known to such person at that time. At settlement, a fully-completedHUD-1 settlement statement showing actual settlement costs must be madeavailable to borrower and seller. These requirements are in Sections 4and 5 of RESPA. HUD has used its statutory authority to create narrow exceptionsfrom these sections. RESPA also prohibits a seller from requiring a buyerto use a particular title company (Section 9) and limits the size of lender-heldescrow accounts for taxes, insurance and other charges (Section 10). Finally,Section 8 of RESPA prohibits kickbacks for referral of business incidentto or part of a settlement service and also prohibits splitting of a chargefor a setttlement service other than for actual services rendered (<T3>i.e., </T3>no payment of unearned fees). Violations of Section 8 areenforceable by criminal penalties and injunctions, and Sections 8 and 9are each enforceable by private actions for damages in Federal or Statecourts. RESPA has no specific provisions for enforcement of other sections.Regulation X has not been amended since it was issued in final form onJune 4, 1976, except for one change in 1977 regarding an equal opportunitynotice (42 FR 19327). HUD needs to conform Regulation X to the most recentamendment of RESPA which is contained in Section 461 of the Housing andUrban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983 (``HURRA'') (Pub. L. 98-181). HUD proposesto use this opportunity to make certain other clarifying and editorialchanges and to cover provisions of RESPA (<T3>e.g., </T3>Section 10) which are not covered in the current regulations.The proposed rule should be considered an updating of Regulation X ratherthan a complete revision.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Controlled Business</ITAG>A. BackgroundSection 8(a) of RESPA reads:<ITAG tagnum="21">No person shall give and no person shall accept any fee, kickback,or thing of value pursuant to any agreement or understanding, oral or otherwise,that business incident to or a part of a real estate settlement serviceinvolving a federally related mortgage loan shall be referred to any person.</ITAG>Hence, a Section \8\<NOTE/> violation requires: (1) Transfer of a thing of value; (2)the transfer must be <T3>pursuant to</T3> an agreement or understanding to refer business incidentto or part of a real estate settlement service; and (3) implicitly, theremust be an actual referral pursuant to the agreement or understanding.A Section 8 violation can be readily determined where a specific payment\2\<NOTE/> is made for a specific referral and there is no other apparentreason (such as rendering of actual services) for the payment. Where atransaction is not identifiably related to a payment, or only to a paymentwhich ordinarily has some other legitimate purpose, such as a corporatedividend, determination of a Section 8 violation is more difficult. Also,where the party receiving the payment is an owner of the party making thepayment, as in the case of a corporate dividend, any referral agreementor understanding is unlikely to be expressly stated but may be implicitin the ownership relationship. These difficulties in applying Section 8to so-called ``controlled business arrangements'' were the principal impetusfor the 1983 amendment of RESPA through Section 461 of HURRA.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Since the ``controlled business'' issue arises only withrespect to Section 8(a), subsequent references in this Section II to ``Section8'' generally are references only to Section 8(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ In this discussion and in the proposed rule, ``payment''is synonymous with the statutory term ``thing of value'' and does not necessarilymean a transfer of money.As defined in Section 3(7) of RESPA (added by Section 461 of HURRA), a``controlled business arrangement'' is an arrangement in which a person``who is in a position to refer business incident to or a part of a settlementservice involving a Federally related mortgage loan'' (or an ``associate''of that person) refers such business to a provider thereof in which thereferring person (or an ``associate'' of that person) has either an ``affiliaterelationship'' or a 1% or larger ``direct or beneficial'' ownership interest.``Associate'' is defined in a new Section 3(8) of RESPA and includes variouspersonal and business relationships.HUD currently has no regulatory position concerning the legality of controlledbusiness arrangements under Section 8 of RESPA, except to the extent thatRegulation X indicates that payment of dividends or distribution of partnershipprofits may constitute the transfer of a ``thing of value'' required fora Section 8 violation (andSection; 3500.14(b) and Appendix B, IllustrationNo. 10). Illustration No. 10 gives specific examples of illegal dividendschemes or partnership distribution schemes: if the dividends, amount ofstock or share of partnership profits varied in proportion to actual oranticipated referrals by the owner/partner, or if funds were retained forsubsequent distribution in proportion to the amount of referred business.However, there is no stated HUD position on the legality of controlledbusiness arrangements where payments are less obviously part of referralagreements or understandings. A purpose of this proposed rule is to proposesuch a position in conformity to Section 461 of HURRA.B. Legislative ResponseThe Subcommittee on Housing and Community Development of the House Committeeon Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs held hearings on the ``controlledbusiness'' question on September 15-16, 1981. By May 1982 the House Committeehad reported H.R. 6296 which contained ``controlled business'' amendmentsto RESPA (Section 518); Section 518 of H.R. 1 introduced in 1983 was identical.\3\<NOTE/> The eventual provision (Section 461 of HURRA) is similarto this Section 518.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ House Reports were issued in 1982 and 1983 which shedsome light on the RESPA amendment (H.R. Rep. No. 532, 97th Cong. 2d Sess.(1982), pp. 51-57; H.R. Rep. No. 123, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), pp.75-8, 131-2). They are referred to as the ``1983 House Report'' and the``1982 House Report'' in the text. The hearings transcript also containsvaluable background material. The only other legislative history is anexchange on the House floor regarding the ``good faith'' defense to a failureto make disclosures required for the new controlled business arrangementexemption, 129 Cong. Rec. H10514 (daily ed. November 18, 1983).As amended, RESPA now defines a controlled business arrangement in thedefinitions section (Section 3(7)) and contains a new exemption to Section8 for controlled business arrangements which meet certain tests (Section8(c)(4)). Nothing in RESPA explicitly states that controlled business arrangementsare barred by RESPA, but the structure of the legislative amendment andthe accompanying House Report language compels the conclusion that Congressregards the existing prohibition in Section 8 as a sufficient legal basisfor HUD sanctions against controlled business arrangements, so that a compensatedreferral agreement can be inferred from the mere fact of a controlled businessarrangement and an ordinary dividend structure. The question which HUDhad left open regarding controlled business arrangements where the ``returnon capital'' did <T3>not</T3> vary in proportion to referrals is addressed in only the thirdof three required elements of the new exemption. Irrespective of the natureor method of calculation of payments in a controlled business arrangement,the other two elements usually must be satisfied to benefit from the exemption.Unless failure to comply with one or both of the other elements is itselfsufficient to raise a question of a Section 8 violation, the exemptionwould have no point.C. IssuesTwo basic questions are posed by the controlled business arrangement amendment.First, are controlled business arrangements <T3>per se</T3> Section 8 violations unless all tests for the exemptionare met (<T3>i.e.,</T3> is the new Section 8(c)(4) exemption merely a ``safe harbor''ensuring legality, or a statement of the <T3>only legal form</T3> of controlled business arrangement?). Second,should HUD provide an explicit regulatory exemption broader than the statutoryone?While the existence of a controlled business arrangement probably mustraise the <T3>presumption</T3> of a Section 8 violation for the controlled businessarrangement exemption to make sense, it is HUD's view that there is littlelegal or factual justification for viewing a controlled business arrangementwhich fails to meet all elements of the new exemption as a <T3>per se </T3>Section 8 violation (<T3>i.e, </T3>legal only if the elements of the new exemption are satisfied).Under that approach, no factual showing by either the provider of settlementservices or incidental business or the owner of the provider could defeatthe conclusions that, given any referral by the owner or an ``associate''of the owner, a referral agreement exists and any dividend or similar returnon ownership interests is a payment pursuant to that agreement. These conclusionswould be enshrined in the regulations no matter how minor the proportionof referral business, the actual circumstances leading to the referral,the relation in time between referral and period of business on which anydividends or other payments were based, whether there are any dividendsor other payments, whether the referring party (if an ``associate'') knewof the controlled business arrangement, or other factors. If Congress wantedthis result it could easily have modified Section 8(a) or otherwise stateddirectly that some or all controlled business arrangements were alwaysillegal without regard to Section 8(a). The RESPA amendments passed in1983 do not compel this reading.HUD is proposing in this rule to interpret and clarify the statute andnot significantly expand the statutory exemption or reverse Congress' presumptions.HUD will rely heavily on public comments in making its final determinationon whether the regulation should differ from the statute in more respects.Specific comments are solicited concerning the need and justification forany additional exemptions beyond the scope of the statutory exemption,or for narrower scope for the presumption of illegality stated in proposedandSection; 3500.15(a) and discussed below. Of course, HUD has no discretionto narrow the statutory exemption. Definitions are proposed (in andSection; 3500.15(c)) for these terms: ``associate''(using the statutory definition), ``affiliate relationship'' (using thedefinition suggested in the 1983 House Report), ``beneficial ownership''(using the definition suggested in the 1983 House Report), ``control''(a term used in the ``associate'' definition, with a proposed definitionsimilar to the definition in Section 604(1) of the Condominium and CooperativeAbuse Relief Act of 1980, 15 U.S.C. 3603(1)), ``direct ownership'' and``franchise''/``franchisor''/``franchisee'' (using as proposed definitionthe Federal Trade Commission definitions in 16 CFR 436.2). HUD also consideredthe need to define the term ``controlled business arrangement'' in RegulationX but does not propose to define such term. Because illegal activity underSection 8 consists of the giving and receipt of certain ``things of value'',rather than the existence of certain business ``arrangements'', HUD believesthat it may be misleading to focus on the presence or absence of arrangements.The controlled business arrangement statutory definition is quite expansiveand includes arrangements which may involve payments which raise no apparentSection 8 issues. The current regulation would be more usefully amendedby specifying which <T3>payments </T3>which would occur in a controlled business arrangementshould be presumed Section 8 violations. Comments are invited concerningthese and any other ``definitions'' questions which should be addressedin the ``controlled business'' amendments to Regulation X. HUD proposes to implement the ``controlled business'' statutory provisionsin a new andSection; 3500.15 of Regulation X. <T3>Section 3500.15(a) Controlled business arrangements. </T3>In lieu ofusing the term ``controlled business arrangement'', this new paragraphwould state a presumption of violation of Section 8 whenever a thing ofvalue (<T3>e.g., </T3>a dividend) is paid by a business entity to any person withwhich it has an ``affiliate relationship'' or to an owner of greater thana 1% interest <T3>if</T3> (1) the person receiving the payment is a real estate brokeror agent, lender, mortgage broker, builder or developer, attorney, titlecompany, title agent or other person deriving a significant portion ofthe person's gross income from providing settlement services or businessincident thereto or a part thereof, and (2) if the person receiving thepayment or an associate of such person has referred settlement businessto the person making the payment. As well, payments in these circumstancesto a franchisee by a franchisor (``downstream'' payments such as cash advances)or to a franchisor by a franchisee (<T3>e.g., </T3>royalties) would be presumptive violations. This approachinvolves a paraphrase of the statutory ``controlled business arrangement''definition with a focus on the payment rather than on the ``arrangement''.Questions raised by the proposed andSection; 3500.15(a), on which commentis invited, are_1. Who is a ``person in a position to refer business incident to or partof a real estate settlement service''? As indicated above, such a person(or an associate of such a person) would need to make a referral in orderfor the statutory definition of ``controlled business arrangement'' toapply. While the phrase could literally mean any person, this would makethe statutory language unnecessary. Congress apparently intended to addressa limited class of ``controlled business'' referrals. The 1982 House Report(p. 53) indicates that the phrase referred to a real estate broker or agent,lender, builder or developer, or attorney_all persons whom homebuyers oftenmight approach for referrals to settlement services providers and thereforepersons more likely to have dividends and similar payments which mightbe related to referrals. For purposes of the ``presumption'' approach adoptedin the proposed rule, HUD has elected not to use the phrase ``person ina position to refer settlement services,'' but rather to limit the broadlyworded statutory class to real estate brokers or agents, lenders, mortgagebrokers, builders or developers, attorneys, title companies, title agents,or other persons deriving a significant portion of their gross income fromproviding settlement services. Comment is invited on this approach, aswell as on the question of what is a ``significant portion of gross income''.2. What is an ``ownership interest'' of more than 1%? The statutory definitionof controlled business arrangement does not apply if the ``person in aposition to refer'' (or associate) does not have an ownership interestgreater than 1% in the settlement services provider receiving the referral.Since the focus of Section 8 is on illegal payments, the proposed rulewould apply this test to payments (<T3>e.g., </T3>more than 1% of total dividends) rather than using otherpossible tests such as control or voting rights. HUD has some concern thatthe 1% figure used in the statute may be unnecessarily low and invitescomment on the possible use of HUD's exemptive authority to state a higherthreshold ownership interest.3. Is it necessary to cover ``affiliate relationships''? The statutorycontrolled business arrangement definition covers referrals by personswith ``affiliate relationships'' with the provider receiving referralsin addition to ownership relationships. The 1983 House Report describesthese relationships (p. 76) and indicates that the phrase covers situationsof ``control'' among business entities, which are also included in the``associate'' definition. Because of the overlap with the definition of``associate'', the reference to ``affiliate relationships'' may not addany significant group of payments which should be presumptive Section 8violations. The proposed andSection; 3500.15(a) references ``affiliate relationships''.HUD seeks examples of cases where omission of the term ``affiliate relationship''would have a significant effect.4. What time period is relevant for the referral? Under andSection; 3500.15(a)a payment would only be presumptively illegal if a referral were made,and Section 8(a) of RESPA implicitly requires a referral as an elementof a violation. In order for the presumption to be reasonable, the referralshould occur during some period relevant to the payment in question. HUDproposes that, in order to raise the presumption of andSection; 3500.15(a),the referral must have occurred after publication of the proposed rule,so that interested persons could have had an indication of HUD's viewson the statutory requirements through this proposed rule, and also after(if later) the date of any previous presumptively illegal payment. Forexample, if a person received quarterly dividends but neither that personnor any associate received any other payments from a company, a key questionto determine legality of the dividend would be whether the person or anassociate referred any business to the company since payment of the lastquarterly dividend. If not, andSection; 3500.15(a) would raise no presumptionof illegality regarding that payment ``required''.<T3>Section 3500.15(b) Required use. </T3>The concept of ``required use''of a particular provider of a settlement service is important for applicationof the controlled business arrangement exemption contained in section 8(c)(4)(B)of RESPA and andSection; 3500.15(b) of the proposed rule. HUD proposes toincorporate the same concept within the definition of ``referral'' forpurposes of the general anti-kickback prohibition of Section 8 of RESPA,covered in andSection; 3500.14 of the proposed rule. A definition of ``requireduse'' appears in proposed andSection; 3500.2(i). HUD takes a broad view of``required use'' as covering any situation where the use of a particularprovider for a settlement service is a condition of the availability ofsome other distinct service or property (including situations where theother service or property will otherwise still be available but at a differentprice). However, only the person paying for a service could be consideredthe one ``required'' to use a particular provider of that service.<T3>Section 3500.15(b) Controlled business exemptions. </T3>Subsection(b) of proposed andSection; 3500.15 would implement Section 8(c)(4), thenew last sentence of Section 8(c), and Section 8(d)(3) of RESPA. The proposedexemption would follow the three-part structure of Section 8(c)(4) withthese major elements: (1) A requirement for <T3>disclosure </T3>of the relationship between parties giving and receivingthe referral with estimated charges for the referred business, (2) <T3>a bar against required use </T3>of a particular provider (except inspecified exceptions) and (3) a <T3>bar against any additional thing of value </T3>paid to the referringparty or associate beyond return on ownership interest, return on franchiserelationship, or payments otherwise permissible under Section 8(c) of RESPA.Major questions faced in interpreting the new statutory provisions anddrafting this proposed exemption were_1. What needs to be disclosed? When? The exemption requires the referringparty to disclose the ``existence of * * * [a controlled business] arrangement''.Since HUD does not propose to define ``controlled business arrangement'',HUD proposes a requirement of written disclosure of the <T3>nature </T3>of the relationship between referring party and provider(<T3>e.g., </T3>owner and subsidiary, spouse of owner or provider, or franchiseeof franchiser owned by same company as provider). A written estimate ofcharges would also be required which would, like the lender good faithestimate required by andSection; 3500.7, use the terminology of the HUD-1settlement statement. HUD does not propose a particular form for disclosure,although comment on this question and the question of whether both disclosuresmust be provided on the same piece of paper is invited. Generally, thedisclosure would have to be provided no later than the referral (not threedays after the triggering event as for the good faith estimate requiredby andSection; 3500.7 of Regulation X). However, by statute, lenders mayprovide the disclosure with the good faith estimate; the proposed rulewould also permit the controlled business arrangement disclosure to becombined with a statement of fixed borrower settlement charges under andSection;3500.7(e). Special timing rules are also proposed to cover the instanceswhere certain attorneys may <T3>require </T3>use of a particular provider so that the timing of thereferral may be uncertain. (These are special statutory exceptions to thenormal rule that the controlled business arrangement exemption is unavailablewhen use of a particular provider is required.) The proposed rule wouldprovide that if a lender requires use of a particular provider in connectionwith a loan for which the borrower will pay no closing costs (and thuswill receive no good faith estimate) the ``referral'' would occur uponloan application. For an attorney requiring use of an affiliated titlecompany, the ``referral'' would occur at that point where the attorneyshould know that the client representation would involve use of title insurance.The fact that a requirement to use a particular provider is not alwaysprohibited in the context of a controlled business arrangement nor generallyprohibited by Section 8 does not preclude possible antitrust liabilityon the ground of an illegal tie-in.2. What does the ``good faith'' exception to the first element of the exemptioninvolve? Section 8(d)(3), which provides that noncompliance with the ``disclosure''elements of the exemption does not remove the exemption in certain ``goodfaith'' cases, is based on Section 130(c) of the Truth in Lending Act.The proposed rule repeats the statutory provision. The proposed rule furtherindicates that an error of legal judgment with respect to a person's obligationsunder RESPA is not a <T3>bona fide error. </T3>The proposed rule does not prescribe requiredor recommended procedures for disclosure. The proposed rule notes thatjudicial and administrative precedent under Section 130(c) of the Truthin Lending Act are not determinative for HUD.3. What is a ``return on ownership interest''? This phrase is used in Section8(c)(4)(C) of RESPA, which is the third element of the exemption. HUD doesnot consider it possible to prescribe all the typical or acceptable methodsof calculating return on the various forms of corporate, partnership andother ownership interests. HUD does propose to make clear that the labelgiven to a payment (``dividend'', ``partnership distribution'') is notdeterminative and that a payment calculated with direct reference to numberor value of referrals (rather than, <T3>e.g., </T3>total volume of business) is not permissible. The proposedrule would reaffirm the comments to Illustration 10 in the current AppendixB to Regulation X. HUD is particularly interested in examples of possiblepayments which are ``borderline'' cases, from actual experience to theextent possible, so that HUD can address in the final rule the questionswhich are likely to arise.4. What is a ``return on franchise relationship''? This phrase is alsoused in Section 8(c)(4)(C) of RESPA. As with ownership interests, thisis difficult to define affirmatively. The legislative history suggestsuse of the franchise agreement as a guide. The proposed rule considersit necessary that a payment to or from a franchisee be pursuant to a franchiseagreement; however, a franchise agreement cannot insulate true kickbacksor referral fees. The franchise agreement should not be adjusted on thebasis of a previous amount of referrals by the franchisor or franchisees.As with ownership interests, franchise payments should not be directlyrelated to number or value of referrals. HUD is particularly interestedin learning about the ``borderline'' cases from actual experience.5. What time period is relevant for the controlled business arrangementexemption? The first and second elements of the exemption relate to referrals,presumably during some time period. This should be the same time periodand thus the same referrals which would trigger the proposed andSection;3500.15(a), which would create a presumption of illegality for certainpayments as discussed above. Proposed andSection; 3500.15(b)(1) discussesthe time period. The disclosure (first element) must be provided no laterthan the time of each referral or if the lender requires use of a particularprovider, the time of application. Lenders may satisfy this requirementat the time that the good faith estimate or statement under andSection; 3500.7(e)is provided. An attorney, which requires a client to use a particular titleinsurance agent, may satisfy the requirement no later than the time theattorney knew or should have known that the client's transaction wouldrequire issuance of a title insurance policy. Proposed andSection; 3500.15(b)(1)states that if the three conditions described in andSection;andSection; 3500.15(b)(1)(i),(ii) and (iii) are satisfied since the date of any previous payment whichwas presumptively made pursuant to an agreement for the referral of businessor the date of publication of the proposed rule, then the payment willnot be considered a violation of Section 8.D. Appendix BNew Illustrations 11-14 are proposed to be added to Appendix B of RegulationX in order to illustrate application of the proposed controlled businessarrangement provisions to various fact situations. An additional sentenceis proposed for the current Illustration 10.Proposed Illustration 11 would be the most simple ``controlled business''situation, and the comments would summarize the proposed andSection; 3500.15,including subsection (b)(1). In proposed Illustration 12, the referringparty would be a franchisee of an owner and both dividends to the ownerand any payments by the owner/franchisor to its franchisee would be presumedto be illegal unless the relevant exemption was applied. Proposed Illustration13 would show how indirect ownership (through more than one corporate layer)could result in an ``associate'' relationship with a resulting presumptionof illegality for payments by the subsidiary company. Franchise relationshipsunmixed with ownership relationships would be discussed in proposed Illustration14, in which a franchisee refers business to another franchisee. Such areferral arrangement would not be presumptively illegal under andSection;3500.15(a), although it would be illegal under andSection; 3500.14(b) ifsome thing of value were transferred for referrals, such as reciprocalreferrals by each franchisee.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Section 8_The Graham Case</ITAG>Since the enactment of RESPA, HUD has considered that the prohibitionsof Section 8 of RESPA extended to loan referrals (see illustrations 2 and7 in 24 CFR Part 3500, Appendix B). Although the making of a loan is notdelineated as a ``settlement service'' in section 3(3) of RESPA, HUD hastraditionally taken the position, based on the statutory language, thatthis list was not to be inclusive of all settlement services.This rationale is grounded in the following arguments: (1) Making a Federally-relatedmortgage loan is central to Federal regulation of settlement services;(2) the position that the making of a loan is business incident to or partof a settlement service is based upon a reasonable interpretation of thestatute: Congress could not have meant to exclude the making of a mortgageloan; (3) the legislative history indicates that Congress intended to makethe scope of RESPA as expansive as possible to deal with the abuses thentaking place in the real estate business.However, some believe that RESPA does not apply to mortgage loans, eventhough they recognize that the making of a loan is an integral part ofthe home purchase process. These commentators believe that RESPA was onlyintended to apply to ancillary services incidental to the settlement. Intheir view, the exclusion of loans from section 3(3) means that Congressdid not intend RESPA to apply to the making of a loan.The approach was adopted in <T3>United States v. Graham Mortgage Corp., </T3>740 F.2d 414 (6th Cir.1984), <T3>reh den</T3>., Nos. 83-1628 and 83-1629 (6th Cir., filed September26, 1984), wherein the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals refused to followHUD's interpretation of the scope of Section 8(a) for purposes of a criminalprosecution.This <T3>Graham</T3> case involved a realty company which was engaged both intraditional brokerage activity and in the purchase, rehabilitation andresale of homes for its own account. A mortgage banker provided interimfinancing to the realty company for its purchase, rehabilitation and saleof homes for its own account. For each such loan that it received, therealty company agreed to refer to the mortgage banker two loan applicantsfrom its regular brokerage business, in addition to referring the purchaserof the rehabilitated house. The mortgage banker, when making loans to purchasersof the rehabilitated homes, charged the realty company fewer points thanit charged other sellers. To recoup the income lost through this reductionin points charged to the realty company, the mortgage banker increasedthe points charged to sellers in transactions where the buyer-borrowerhad been referred by the realty company from its regular brokerage business.On appeal of a conviction under Section 8(a) of the mortgage banking company,certain of its executives, and an executive of the realty company, theGovernment argued that the transaction came within the prohibitions ofSection 8(a) on the theory that the making of a loan is itself a ``settlementservice'' within the meaning of Section 8(a), notwithstanding its absencefrom the admittedly non-exclusive definition contained in Section 3(3)of RESPA. Finding the statute and the legislative history ambiguous andHUD's administrative interpretations (including informal opinion letters)inconsistent, the Court of Appeals held that, for purposes of a criminalprosecution under Section 8(a), the term ``settlement service'' did notinclude the making of a mortgage loan.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ One civil case, <T3>Eisenberg</T3> v.<T3> Comfed Mtge.,</T3> U.S.D.C. for Dist. of Mass. (84-3486-4), adoptedwithout examination the <T3>Graham</T3> reasoning. The Department had no role in this case, andwould not have considered the matter complained of_excess points_to havebeen a RESPA question.Since the <T3>Graham</T3> decision and during the course of its preparation of thisproposed rule, the Department has received considerable correspondenceurging that it not adopt a regulatory position directly contrary to theCourt of Appeals' decision by adopting a definition of ``settlement services''that specifically includes ``the making of a Federally related mortgageloan.'' The basis of this recommendation, as stated in one such letter,was a concern that subjecting mortgage financing to the prohibitions inRESPA ``may have a serious and negative impact on the secondary mortgagemarket, and may halt efforts to introduce efficiencies in the mortgagelending process.''The expressed concern regarding halting efforts to introduce efficienciesimplicitly assumes that the mortgage marketplace does not need governmentintermediation and that settlement fees must be similar for competing membersof the industry to survive. HUD has been told that borrowers are more sophisticatedthan ever before and have more accurate information available to make decisionsregarding lending related services. While HUD is charged with providingprotection to homebuyers, it seeks to avoid promotion of economic inefficienciesor placement of unwelcome burdens on lenders and other participants inthe settlement process.Given the decisions in the <T3>Graham</T3> and <T3>Eisenberg </T3>cases, as well as recent developments in the mortgagelending industry, HUD is seeking comments from the public regarding theextent that RESPA should apply to the making of a loan, or for desirableexceptions that HUD might create. HUD has already responded to informalcomments and concerns and is currently proposing liberalization of theprevious RESPA rules, with a ``mortgage broker exception'', and by allowingdisclosed voluntary payments by borrowers to mortgage brokers. HUD, therefore,strongly urges additional comments, including economic analysis, regardingthese matters.The term ``settlement services'' was not defined in the previous RESPArule (andSection; 3500.2). HUD now proposes to add a definition of ``settlementservices'' which states that such services are ``<T3>any</T3> services provided in connection with settlement.'' (andSection;3500.2(n)). This definition will be restated at the time of publicationof the final rule to set forth HUD's determination regarding the makingof a loan as a settlement service. Pending implementation of the finalrule, HUD will adhere to its longstanding position and continue to enforceRESPA civilly in all federal circuits and will bring criminal prosecutionsin every circuit except for the Sixth Circuit (Kentucky, Michigan, Ohioand Tenneessee) for violations, including those involving the making ofa mortgage loan.The Department has received numerous letters and telephone calls regardingits position on mortgage broker activities. The Department requests commentson its position regarding mortgage brokers as currently reflected in Illustration7. Under the current illustration, compensation by a lender to a mortgagebroker is permitted only if the mortgage broker performs additional services,such as obtaining credit and appraisal information, and the payment reflectsthe reasonable value of those services ``without reference to the referralvalue.'' The Department recently has received numerous requests for informaladvice regarding evolving mortgage origination practices, some of whichhave urged that the requirement that mortgage brokers perform additionalservices introduces an unwarranted inefficiency into the process. Othershave suggested that abusive mortgage brokering practices are developingand that HUD needs to clarify the regulations and discuss permissible practices.Moreover, HUD questions whether the dangers of abuse of position whichCongress sought to prevent are presented by mortgage brokers who are nototherwise involved in the transaction and/or are approached by borrowersfor the explicit purpose of being brought together with a lender. Whena borrower decides to deal with and pay a mortgage broker the cost of thereferral is clearly separable from the cost of the loan and a borrowerwill be aware that a referral fee can be avoided entirely if the borrowerchooses to locate and approach mortgage lenders directly.In an informal legal opinion given by former General Counsel John Knappdated April 24, 1986, HUD approved a mortgage brokerage program involvingvoluntary payments by borrowers to persons who assisted in bringing thelender and borrower together. The voluntary payment was to be disclosedon both the good faith estimate of settlement costs and HUD-1 settlementstatement and was not a condition of the loan or other settlement service.The Department continues to believe that this practice does not violateSection 8 of RESPA. Because this is a complex issue and other variationson this program may be developing, we strongly urge public comment on thisissue and request examples of potential or actual problems caused by thisopinion.To clarify the issue within the framework of the regulation HUD is proposinga mortgage broker exemption at andSection; 3500.14(h)(6) for a voluntarypayment by a borrower to a person who has acted as a mortgage broker orhas otherwise assisted in bringing the lender and borrower together, providedthat such voluntary payment is disclosed on both the good faith estimateof settlement costs and HUD-1 settlement statement and is not a conditionof the loan or other settlement statement service. This exemption is referencedin revised Illustration 7 of Appendix B and the required disclosure ofmortgage broker fees form is set forth in proposed new Appendix D to RegulationX. The Mortgage Broker Fee Disclosure Form is to be attached to the goodfaith estimate. HUD is considering the practical and logistical issuesraised by this proposed form. For example, should the good Faith EstimateForm (Appendix C) be combined with the Mortgage Broker Fee Disclosure form(Appendix D) or should mortgage broker fee disclosure language be includedwith the other mandatory good faith estimate language in andSection; 3500.7(c)?HUD requests any alternative proposals which would be less burdensome andmore in conformance with actual business practices.HUD is also considering adding an explicit exemption in andSection; 3500.14for a ``payment by a lender to a person who has acted as a mortgage brokeror has otherwise assisted in bringing the lender and borrower together,provided that such person has not otherwise acted as a provider of settlementservices in connection with the transaction and has not received any othercompensation or thing of value from the borrower, the seller, the builder,or any other person for services related to the transaction.'' This proposedexemption could be considered an extension of the exemption already extendedby Section 8(c)(1)(C) of RESPA to the payment of a fee ``by a lender toits duly appointed agent for services actually performed in the makingof a loan.'' Any mortgage broker exemption will be adopted only after consultationwith the Attorney General, the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs, theFederal Home Loan Bank Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the Secretaryof Agriculture.\5\<NOTE/> HUD intends to begin this consultation process after publicationof this proposed rule but anticipates that the consultation will also encompassconsideration by such other agencies, as well as by HUD, of public commentsreceived on the proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ It should be noted that the Mortgage Broker exemptiondoes not comport with current Federal Housing Administration rules, specifically24 CFR 203.1(b) which states as follows:<ITAG tagnum="28">(b) </ITAG><T3>Prohibited payments.</T3> A mortgagee may not pay anything of value,directly or indirectly, in connection with any insured mortgage transactionor transactions to any person including but not limited to an attorney,escrow agent, title company, consultant, mortgage broker, seller, builder,or real estate agent if such person has received any other compensationfrom the mortgagor, the seller, the builder, or any other person for servicesrelated to such transactions or from or related to the purchase or saleof the mortgaged property, except that compensation may be paid for theactual performance of such services as may be approved by the Commissioner.The mortgagee shall not pay a referral fee to any person or organization.<ITAG tagnum="28">Comments are requested as to whether the FHA rule should also be alteredso as to encompass a mortgage broker exemption.</ITAG>A mortgage broker exemption would not make compensated loan referrals bypersons who are otherwise involved in the transaction <T3>per se </T3>or even presumptively illegal under Section 8. Instead,it would leave the legality of such compensation dependent upon a determinationof the reasonableness of the charge in relation to the value of the service.(Under the mortgage broker exemption mentioned above, a determination ofreasonableness of the broker's compensation is not required. HUD anticipatesthat market competition among lenders based on cost of the loan packageto borrowers will provide an effective and adequate source of restrainton fees paid to mortgage brokers.) As indicated above, HUD in recent months has received numerous requestsfor informal advice regarding the possible application of Section 8 ofRESPA to various loan origination practices, including computerized loaninformation and origination service networks and use of mortgage brokerspaid directly by borrowers, and has been able to respond affirmativelyto most such requests on the basis of its pre-<T3>Graham </T3>position. Therefore, HUD does not believe that continuedadherence to that position, as reflected in the proposed rule, will interferewith continuing efforts to introduce efficiencies into the mortgage originationprocess. HUD solicits comment on application of Section 8 to the mortgage loan originationprocess, including suggestions as to additional circumstances that mightusefully be treated by Illustrations in Appendix B. HUD is especially concernedabout Section 8 enforcement matters and intends to pursue violations demonstratedin Illustrations in Appendix B as part of its stepped-up enforcement policy.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Other Provisions of RESPA </ITAG>The current Regulation X makes no mention of Sections 9, 10, 16, 17, or19(c) of RESPA. (Section 11 does not pertain to HUD, while Sections 13,14 and 15 require reports of demonstration projects by HUD and do not imposeobligations on any other party). All other sections of RESPA are coveredby Regulation X. HUD is proposing interpretive regulations for Section9(a) (seller cannot require buyer to use particular title company_proposedandSection; 3500.16) and Section 10 (limitations on escrow accounts_proposedandSection; 3500.17). Sections 9(b) (liability for violation of 9(a)_proposedandSection; 3500.19(c)), 16 (court jurisdiction_proposed andSection; 3500.19(d)),17 (effect on contracts and liens_proposed andSection; 3500.18) and 19(c)(new investigative and subpoena authority_proposed andSection; 3500.19(e))need no interpretation but HUD is proposing to incorporate them nearlyverbatim in Regulation X so that it would cover all parts of RESPA relevantto private parties, thereby avoiding the need for them to consult boththe statute and Regulation X. HUD issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 1978 requestingcomments on various matters including regulations for Section 9 and Section10 (43 FR 39701). With regard to Section 9, most commenters opposed a regulationwith one or more of these objections: Section 9 itself is adequate, Statesadequately regulate the area, there were no known abuses in the area, and(most common) ``clarifying'' regulations tend to confuse rather than clarify.HUD took no action following the 1978 ANPR. If HUD repeated Section 9 verbatimin Regulation X, none of these objections would be relevant. HUD invitescomments generally on what clarifications or interpretations of Section9, if any, would be desirable as opposed to a verbatim incorporation ofSection 9 in the regulations. In addition to a verbatim incorporation,HUD is proposing to incorporate only one position which HUD has repeatedlystated in unofficial staff interpretations_that sellers who choose andpay the title company do not violate Section 9 as long as they do not indirectlyrecover the cost from the buyer as a separate charge or a specific adjustmentto the sales price. The concept of ``required use'' is central to Section9 and the new andSection; 3500.14(g) discussed above would also be applicablehere.The majority of commenters also opposed a regulation for Section 10, generallyon the grounds that no escrow account abuses existed, that State requirementsto pay interest kept escrow accounts to a minimum and the requirementsof the Federal Home Loan Bank Board were stricter. However, a significantminority of commenters contended that Section 10 was unclear, incomprehensibleor too complex and encouraged clarifying regulations. HUD proposes to rewardSection 10 requirements to improve their clarity and proposes a new andSection;3500.17 for this purpose. The regulation would apply to all Federally relatedmortgage loans, whenever made, except those which are in classes exemptfrom Regulation X disclosure requirements under andSection; 3500.5(c). Sinceno specific enforcement mechanism is provided to HUD with respect to Section10, HUD believes it is important that borrowers have adequate informationabout their accounts to permit them to determine lender compliance andrequire correction in case of noncompliance. To ensure borrowers are providedwith annual escrow information, HUD has considered requiring an annuallender statement on escrow account status. It would be based in part onState statutes, particularly Cal. Civil Code andSection; 2954.2 (Deering1986 Supp.), Iowa Code Ann. andSection; 524.905(2) (West 1986-7 Cum. Supp.)and Mich. Stat. Ann. andSection; 26.575(1) (Callaghan 1982). HUD believesthat the actual practice of many lenders may already include an annualescrow account statement. HUD solicits comment on the suggested annualstatement requirement and questions whether such a requirement would imposeadditional or unnecessary paperwork burdens. Additionally, HUD invitescomments on the desirability of such regulations, as opposed to verbatimincorporation of section 10.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Changes to Regulation X</ITAG>HUD is proposing numerous other changes to Regulation X. Many are minorchanges to the current text of Regulation X for such purposes as clarifyingterminology, increasing consistent usage of terminology, slight reorganizationof provisions or updating, and will not require a change in the behaviorof persons who currently comply with Regulation X. A few changes can havea substantive impact. This proposed rule is not a complete revision ofRegulation X, nor is it, in general, a proposal to adopt interpretationsof RESPA inconsistent with or beyond the scope of the current RegulationX. It is an updating of the rule with the benefit of over thirteen years'experience. Nevertheless, comments on any matters related to RegulationX are welcome and will be reviewed when the final rule is drafted. Specificchanges being proposed, on which comment is invited, are described in thissection.<T3>Section 3500.2 Definitions. </T3>HUD is proposing to revise some ofthe existing definitions and to add a number of new definitions in additionto the controlled business arrangement-related definitions previously discussedand contained in andSection; 3500.15.1. <T3>Date of settlement. </T3>The current definition uses the date on whichthe lender's security interest becomes effective. The right of one-dayadvance review of the HUD-1 settlement statement is keyed to this date(see andSection; 3500.10) and that right could be meaningless if the borroweris required to sign documents and provide cash to the settlement agentprior to the date the security interest becomes effective. There is alsono uniform nationwide point in a transaction at which a security interestbecomes effective; for example, in some jurisdictions local law could linkeffectiveness to initial funds disbursement which might be delayed afterthe commencement of settlement. HUD therefore proposes to redefine ``dateof settlement'' in terms of the date on which the borrower signs the securitydocuments (or the documents obligating the borrower to repay, for constructionloans to builders or loans to manufactured home dealers which are convertedto permanent financing for the first user of the residence).2. <T3>Federally related mortgage loan. </T3>Currently this term is definedin andSection; 3500.5(b) in a manner which is deliberately more limited thanthe statutory definition. Exemptions from statutory coverage are currentlyincluded both in the definition and in andSection; 3500.5(d), with some overlap.The proposed rule would use the term only in its full statutory sense,with changes from the statutory language only to the extent necessary tointerpret ambiguous statutory language such as ``residential real property.''Exemptions of some classes of loans from the ``disclosure'' and escrowaccount provisions of Regulation X would continue to be listed in andSection;3500.5. The proposed definition would give a broad meaning to the term``residential real estate loan'' as that term is used in andSection; 3500.2(b)(2)(iv)in conformity with the prevailing HUD interpretation.3. <T3>Good faith estimate. </T3>The term would be defined for the first time.4. <T3>HUD-1 settlement statement. </T3>This term would be defined for thefirst time. (The term ``Uniform Settlement Statement'' would no longerbe used under the proposed rule.)5. <T3>Lender </T3>and <T3>mortgaged property. </T3>These terms are proposed for minor changein the wording but not the substance of the current definition.6. <T3>Manufactured home. </T3>This new defined term would replace ``mobilehome'' in keeping with current HUD usage.7. <T3>RESPA </T3>would be redefined to include the 1983 amendment.8. <T3>Settlement. </T3>This key term for RESPA is currently undefined inboth RESPA and Regulation X. It is proposed for definition in two senses:generally as the process of conveying title including rendering of facilitatingservices, and specifically as the actual exchange of funds and documents.As part of the term ``settlement services'', for example, both RESPA andRegulation X use the term ``settlement'' in its general sense while someprovisions, such as the right of one-day advance review of the HUD-1 settlementstatement or the term ``settlement agent'', use the term ``settlement''in its specific sense as an event occurring in a defined time and place.9. <T3>Settlement agent. </T3>This term would be defined as equivalent tothe statutory phrase ``person conducting settlement''. If no one else ischosen, the Lender would be considered the settlement agent.10. <T3>Settlement Service. </T3>This term is defined in Section 3(3) of RESPAbut is not defined directly in Regulation X. The term appears in five substantiveprovisions of the statute: Section 5(c), requiring the lender to providea ``good faith estimate of the amount or range of charges for specificsettlement services the borrower is likely to incur in connection withthe settlement''; Section (8), which prohibits compensation pursuant toany agreement or understanding that ``business incident to or a part ofa real estate settlement service involving a federally related mortgageloan shall be referred to any person''; Section 8(b), which prohibits splittingof charges ``made or received for the rendering of a real estate settlementservice * * * other than for services actually performed''; and Sections3(7) and 8(c)(4)(B), which refer to a provider of settlement services.Since enactment of RESPA, HUD has considered that the term ``settlementservice'' has the same meaning under all sections of RESPA, and that inall contexts the meaning includes the making of the loan itself. This interpretationis reflected in Regulation X as currently in effect. For example, the chargesfor which good faith estimates are required to be made include, among otherthings, items payable in connection with the loan, <T3>e.g., </T3>``loan origination fees'', ``loan discounts (<T3>i.e., </T3>``points''), and ``prepaid interest''. 24 CFR 3500.7(c)and Part 3500, Appendix A. A definition of ``settlement service'' is proposedto be added in andSection;3500.2(n) and includes any services provided inconnection with settlement.11. <T3>Special information booklet. </T3>This term would be defined for thefirst time. The definition would also indicate that the booklet is publishedin the <T4>Federal Register.</T4>12. <T3>Title company. </T3>This term would be defined for the first time byincorporating verbatim Section 3(4) RESPA.<T3>Section 3500.3: </T3>No delegation of authority to HUD field offices.This section would be revised to remove obsolete references to HUD fieldoffices and to indicate the appropriate office for public inquiries. Allpower and authority of the HUD Secretary under RESPA is currently delegatedto the Director, Office of Insured Single Family Housing, 47 FR 30653 (July14, 1982) and 51 FR 43670 (December 3, 1986).<T3>Section 3500.4: Reliance upon rule, regulation or interpretation byHUD. </T3>This section now states that Regulation X and its appendicesare the <T3>only </T3>``interpretations'' of HUD which can provide protection fromliability under Section 19(b) of RESPA. Since Section 19(b) mentions rules,regulations <T3>and </T3>interpretations thereof, HUD clearly has the legal authorityto take a different approach by issuing other official interpretationsof Regulation X on which the public could rely. HUD proposes to modifythis section to permit, but not mandate, a procedure of publishing suchofficial interpretations in the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>Such interpretations would normally be of generalapplicability rather than directed to a specific case. While such procedureswould not necessarily eliminate all unofficial staff responses to specificinquiries, it could reduce staff time spent on repetitive inquiries and,more importantly, reduce the potential for confusion inherent in the theexistence of unofficial interpretations issued over many years which arecollected and published privately and relied upon by the public despitetheir non-binding nature and their possible inconsistency with currentHUD positions.Section 3500.4 currently excludes this staff advice from the scope of ``officialinterpretations'' on which any person may rely. No change from this positionis reflected in the proposed rule being published. However, HUD solicitscomment on the question of the effect to be given to staff responses toinquiries. For example, should such advice be given an effect similar tothat of an IRS private letter ruling, so that at least the party to whomit is addressed may rely upon it? These questions are particularly criticalin the context of Section 8, violation of which may involve criminal penaltiesas well as civil liability.<T3>Section 3500.5 Coverage of RESPA. </T3>As proposed for revision, thissection would no longer define ``Federally related mortgage loan'' (which,as noted, will be defined in andSection; 3500.2(b)) but would serve two purposes:to clarify the meaning of the statutory exclusion of ``temporary financingsuch as a construction loan'' (in andSection; 3(1) of RESPA) and to exemptsome classes of Federally related mortgage loans from the disclosure provisionsand from the escrow account limitations of RESPA/Regulation X. The currentexemptions would be retained in substance but in substantially rewordedand simplified form. An additional exemption would be added for propertypurchased primarily for the purpose of investment.<T3>Section 3500.6 Special information booklet. </T3>Minor editorial changesare proposed for this section. The sole substantive change proposed isa deletion of the current rule requiring only one special information booklet(and, because of andSection; 3500.7(a), one copy of the good faith estimate)in cases of multiple borrowers. HUD believes each borrower should receivethis information in order to fully implement RESPA's objective of consumerinformation. However, HUD proposes not to require the information to beprovided separately to husband and wife or to secondary obligors such asguarantors. HUD recognizes that its proposal differs from Section 121(b)of the Truth in Lending Act in which disclosure to only one primary obligoris required; there is no express or implied equivalent provision in RESPA.HUD requests comments on this change and specifically questions whetherthis new requirement will create unnecessary and burdensome paperwork withouta corresponding benefit.<T3>Section 3500.7 Good faith estimate. </T3>A number of substantive revisionsare proposed. Most important, HUD proposes a suggested format for the goodfaith estimate as set forth in a proposed new Appendix C to RegulationX. The current rule and the proposed rule both permit a lender to use anyform as long as certain minimum requirements are met, but these minimumrequirements would be expanded and made more specific in the proposed rule.In HUD's experience, the good faith estimates actually used by lendersoften fail to meet minimum requirements and may not facilitate borrowercomparison with the HUD-1 settlement statement even when the current andSection;3500.7 is complied with. The suggested format in proposed Appendix C, ifused, should contribute to lender compliance and borrower comprehension.As under the current rule, the lender will also be permited to use SectionL of the HUD-1 settlement statement as long as additional prescribed materialis added.  HUD also proposes modifying andSection; 3500.7(e)(2) which requires any lenderrequiring use of a particular provider of legal or title examination servicesor title insurance to disclose the existence (but not the nature) of any``business relationship'' with the provider. The proposed changes are inproposed andSection; 3500.7(d) and require a disclosure of the <T3>nature</T3> of the relationship (including a non-business relationship)and explain the meaning of ``relationship''. HUD's concerns are that insufficientguidance is currently given to lenders as to when disclosure is needed,and that for disclosure to a borrower the <T3>nature</T3> of a relationship is significant information. HUD alsoproposes to move the recordkeeping requirements of andSection; 3500.7(f)to a new andSection; 3500.10(e). Other minor editorial changes are proposedfor andSection; 3500.7.  <T3>Section 3500.8 Use of HUD-1 settlement statement.</T3> Minor editorialchanges are proposed for this section. All specific requirements for completionof the HUD-1 settlement statement would be contained in revised instructionsin Appendix A to Regulation X. Part of the current paragraph (c) wouldbe incorporated into andSection; 3500.10(b) and the remainder would be incorporatedinto andSection; 3500.10(e). Allowable modifications to the HUD-1 SettlementStatement for certain reporting aspects of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 arepublished at 52 FR 29782, June 3, 1987.  <T3>Section 3500.9 Reproduction of HUD-1 settlement statement.</T3> Minoreditorial changes are proposed for this section.  <T3>Section 3500.10 Inspection and delivery of HUD-1 settlement statement.</T3>Currently lenders must keep completed HUD-1 settlement statements for twoyears after the date of settlement. Since the statute of limitations forSection 8 actions by the HUD Secretary or an Attorney General or insurancecommissioner of a State has been extended to three years, the proposedparagraph (e) would also extend the recordkeeping requirement to threeyears. Paragraphs (b) and (e) are each proposed to include parts of thecurrent andSection; 3500.8(c). In keeping with the change to andSection; 3500.6,each borrower and seller would be entitled to a copy of the HUD-1, buta copy need not be provided separately to both husband and wife or to secondaryobligors such as guarantors. HUD requests comments on this change and specificallyquestions whether this new requirement will create unnecessary and burdensomepaperwork without a corresponding benefit.  <T3>Section 3500.11 Mailing; Section 3500.12 No fee.</T3> Minor editorialchanges are proposed for these sections.  <T3>Section 3500.13 Relation to State laws. </T3>The current section consistsprimarily of a verbatim repetition of Section 18 of RESPA. The proposedrule would rewrite the requirements of Section 18 for clarity while alsoincorporating new Section 8(d)(6) of RESPA. It also would set forth HUD'sview that the term ``State law'' as used in Section 18 should properlybe read as including State regulations as well as legal enactments by Statepolitical subdivisions.  <T3>Section 3500.14 Prohibition against kickbacks and unearned fees.</T3>In addition to changes discussed in Sections II and III above, a revisionof the paragraph structure of the section is proposed to eliminate unnecessaryredundancy and quotation of statutory text, as shown in the following chartwhich compares the current paragraphs in andSection; 3500.14 and the currentheadings with the equivalent proposed paragraphs and headings.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Comparison of Current and Proposed</T4> andSection; 3500.14 <H1>Current paragraphs </H1><H1>Proposed paragraphs</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">No equivalent provision <D>(a) Section 8 violation (states that violation of rule is violationof statute). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(a) Statutory prohibitions (text of andSection; 8(a)-(d)) <D>(b) No referral fees (text of Section 8(a) and material from current(d)). </D><P>(c) No split of charges (text of Section 8(b)); text of Section 8(c)not set forth but substance covered in new (i); text of Section 8(d) movedto new andSection; 3500.18. </P></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(b) Thing of value <D>(d) Thing of value. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(c) Agreement or understanding <D>(e) Agreement or understanding (includes new material). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(d) Payment of thing of value for referral of business <D>No equivalent provision; material combined with new (b). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(e) Payment for goods or services actually rendered <D>No equivalent provision; material combined with new (c). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">No equivalent provision <D>(f) Referral. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(f) Exemptions <D>(g) Not violations under this section (includes new exemptions, old(f) and some material from old (e)). </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">No equivalent provision <D>(h) Secondary Market transactions. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(g) Examples of violations under section 8 <D>(i) Appendix B.</D></ITAG></ITAG> HUD also proposes to revise the current andSection; 3500.14(f)(1), whichhas been redesignated as andSection; 3500.14(g)(2)(ii) in the proposed rule,to apply to all kinds of insurance which may be a settlement service ratherthan only title insurance. HUD proposes to delete the current andSection;3500.14(g)(4) as unnecessary and confusing in light of the new ``controlledbusiness'' provisions. <T3>Sections 3500.16-18.</T3> These proposed new sections are explainedin Section IV of this preamble. <T3>Section 3500.19 Enforcement and investigations.</T3> Paragraph (a) would generally explain the manner of enforcement of thevarious provisions of RESPA. Paragraph (b) would repeat, largely verbatim,Sections 8(d)(1), (2), (4) and (5) of RESPA. Paragraph (c) would repeat,largely verbatim, Section 9(b) of RESPA and note the unavailability ofauthority to award court costs and attorney's fees in Section 9 actions.It should be noted that while RESPA does not specifically authorize sucha recovery pursuant to its own provisions, a buyer may be able to recovercourt costs and attorney's fees under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedureor other statutory authority. Paragraphs (d) and (e) of this proposed newsection set forth Sections 16 and 19(c) of RESPA. <T3>Appendix A.</T3> HUD's 1981 report to the Congress, required by section14 of RESPA, reported that the present instructions for completing theHUD-1 settlement statement contained in Appendix A to Regulation X were``incomplete, imprecise and difficult to understand.'' In response to theseconcerns of providers of settlement services and consumers and based uponseveral informal inquiries which indicate many common errors in completingthe HUD-1, HUD proposes to revise the instructions considerably. Becausemost of these concerns could be addressed through improved instructions,no substantive change in the HUD-1 is proposed. HUD intends to maintainthe HUD-1 in its current consumer-oriented form. Lenders and others whoreproduce the HUD-1 should be aware that the required OMB number has changedas shown on the form in Appendix A. Future number changes may be announcedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> under the proposed andSection; 3500.9(a)(5). Commentsare requested regarding these proposed instructions and other problemswith the HUD-1 or the instructions. Comments are also requested regarding any problems or advantages whichwould result from reduction in size of the HUD-1. The General ServicesAdministration has requested HUD to convert as many forms as possible tothe 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; size. While developing the proposed rule, HUD attemptedto reduce the size of the current legal-size HUD-1 but found some drawbacks,<T3>e.g.</T3>, reduction in the number of blank numbered spaces and eliminationof the blank space at the bottom of the form. For clearer terminology, the proposed instructions would use terms whichare defined in proposed Regulation X (<T3>i.e.</T3>, date of settlement, settlement, settlement agent). To aidboth the settlement agent and the borrower, the proposed instructions wouldprovide guidance for each section and line of the HUD-1. Use of blank lineswould also be explained. Frequently, settlement agents have failed to provide all information requiredin each line. The proposed instructions would emphasize the insertion ofaddresses and zip codes in Section F, identification of the person or firmto whom payments have been made and listing of percentage and <T3>per diem</T3> charges. Unlike the current instructions, the proposedinstructions for Sections D and E would require all borrowers and sellersto be named on the HUD-1. The proposed instructions would also describein greater detail the specific settlement charges to be listed in SectionL. The concept of ``P.O.C.'' charges (paid outside of closing) would be clarifiedto address problems in disclosing charges paid outside of settlement incases where borrower's deposits are held by a third party who will notserve as the settlement agent but will retain all or part of the depositas a commission or fee. The current HUD-1 instructions do not assist settlementagents in cases where the settlement agent or someone else holds the borrower'sdeposit against the sales price (earnest money). Proposed instructionsfor Lines 201, 501, 506, 507 and 703 and P.O.C. items would account forthe handling of earnest money deposits. The proposed instructions would elaborate on certain common methods offinancing. For example, proposed instructions for Line 202 would providefor cases involving the use of conversion of temporary financing into permanentfinancing. The types of settlement charges may vary from other settlements,but the proposed instructions would suggest the HUD-1 should be completedtaking into account adjustments and charges related to the temporary andpermanent financing which are known at the date of settlement. Lines 204-209would be used to indicate any seller financing arrangements or other newloans not listed in Line 202. The proposed instructions revise the treatment of various fees in Lines801-811 to reflect the current FHA, VA and FmHA practices and procedures.Because FHA, VA and FmHA do not charge application fees, Line 806 shouldonly be used for application fees required by private mortgage insurancecompanies. VA funding fees should be listed on Line 904 and 905. Proposedinstructions for Lines 808-811 would indicate that these lines are to beused to list additional items payable in connection with the loan includingfees to mortgage originators or mortgage brokers. Proposed instructionsfor Lines 902-905 would provide instructions for listing lump sum mortgageinsurance premiums. Other items which are either required by the lenderto be paid in advance (such as flood insurance, mortgage life insurance,credit life insurance and disability insurance) or paid at settlement butnot required to be paid at settlement would be listed on Lines 904 and905. The proposed instructions would also provide directions for transactionsinvolving more than one attorney (Lines 1100-1113). <T3>Appendix B.</T3> New proposed Illustrations Nos. 11-14 are explainedin Section II of this preamble. <T3>Appendix C.</T3> This proposed new appendix would be a suggested formfor the good faith estimate to correspond to the proposed revision of andSection;3500.7.

A payment that is made repeatedly and is connected in anyway which the volume or value of the business referred to the payor bythe recipient is presumptively made pursuant to any agreement or understandingfor the referral of business.

The payment may be construed as a violationof this section to the extent that the payment exceeds the reasonable valueof such goods, facilities or services. The value of a referral (<T3>i.e., </T3>the value of any additional business obtained thereby) isnot to be taken into account in determining whether the payment exceedsthe reasonable value of such goods, facilities or services. While calculationof a payment as a percentage of loan amount does not necessarily resultin payments in excess of reasonable value, it may have this result whenthe good, facility or service does not vary significantly regardless ofloan amount and when comparable goods, facilities or services are availablefrom other sources which do not calculate payments as a percentage of loanamount.(2) Payment_(i) to attorneys for services actually rendered, or(ii) by a title company or other insurance company to its duly appointedagent for services actually performed in the issuance of a policy of insurance,or(iii) by a lender to its duly appointed agent for services actually performedin the making of a loan.(3) Payments pursuant to cooperative brokerage and referral arrangementsor agreements between real estate agents and brokers.(4) Normal promotional and educational activities that are not directlyconditioned on the referral of business and that do not involve the defrayingof expenses that otherwise would be incurred by persons in a position torefer settlement services or business incident thereto, such as a receptionby a title company, free seminars on title matters to professionals, furnishingproperty descriptions and names of record owners without charge to personssuch as lenders, real estate brokers or attorneys, or distribution of calendarsand other promotional material of nominal value.(5) The waiver by a lender of the requirement that a borrower pay a prepaymentpenalty provided in loan documents, whether or not such waiver is conditionedupon receipt by the lender of a loan application from, or the making ofa loan to, such borrower or a person purchasing a property from such borrower.(6) Voluntary payment by a borrower to a person who has acted as a mortgagebroker or has otherwise assisted in bringing the lender and borrower together,provided that such voluntary payment is disclosed on both the good faithestimate of settlement costs and the HUD-1 settlement statement and isnot a condition of the loan or other settlement service.(h) <T3>Secondary Market Transactions. </T3>Section 8 of RESPA and this sectiondo not apply to sales of loans or commitments to sell loans after settlement.(i) <T3>Appendix B. </T3>Illustrations 1-10 of Appendix B illustrate the requirementsof this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 3500.15</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Controlled business arrangements.</ITAG>(a) <T3>General. </T3>Any payment of a thing of value by a business entityto any person with which it has an affiliate relationship or to a holderof a direct or beneficial ownership interest of more than one percent inthe business entity (including but not limited to corporate dividends andpartnership or joint venture distributions), any payment by a franchiseeto a franchisor, and any payment by a franchisor to a franchisee is presumptivelymade pursuant to an agreement for the referral of business incident toor part of a settlement service. If such a payment is made in connectionwith a Federally related mortgage loan, it is presumptively a violationof section 8 of RESPA if:(1) The person receiving the payment (or beneficial owner for whose benefitthe payment is received) is a real estate broker or agent, lender, mortgagebroker, builder or developer, attorney, title company, title agent or aperson deriving a significant portion of the person's gross income fromproviding settlement services, or an associate of any of the foregoing;and(2) The person receiving the payment (or beneficial owner for whose benefitthe payment is received) or an associate has referred business incidentto or part of a settlement service to the person making the payment sincethe date of any previous payment which was presumptively made pursuantto an agreement for the referral of business under this sentence or thedate of publication of this provision in a proposed rule, whichever islater. An ownership interest of more than one percent means a legal rightto receive more than one percent of all dividends, partnership or jointventure distributions, or similar payments.(b) <T3>Exceptions. </T3>Any payment which is presumptively made pursuant toan agreement for the referral of business under paragraph (a) of this section(or any other payment in the context of a ``controlled business arrangement''as defined in section 3(7) of RESPA) shall not be considered a violationof section 8 of RESPA:(1) If the following conditions set forth in paragraphs (b)(1) (i), (ii)and (iii) of this section have all been satisfied since the date of anyprevious payment which was presumptively made pursuant to an agreementfor the referral of business under paragraph (a) of this section or thedate of publication of this provision as a proposed rule, whichever islater:(i) The person making each referral has provided to each person whose businessis referred both a written disclosure of the nature of the relationshipbetween the provider of settlement services or business incident theretoand the person making the referral and a written estimate of the chargeor range of charges generally made by such provider which describes thecharge using the same terminology, as far as practical, as Section L ofthe HUD-1 settlement statement. The disclosures must be provided no laterthan the time of each referral or, if the lender requires use of a particularprovider, the time of loan application, except that where a lender makesthe referral to a borrower the condition contained in this paragraph (b)(1)(i)may be satisfied as part of and at the time that the good faith estimateor a statement under andSection; 3500.7(e) of this part is provided, andwhenever an attorney or law firm requires a client to use a particulartitle insurance agent, the attorney or law firm shall provide the disclosuresno later than the time the attorney or law firm knew or should have knownthat the client's transaction would require issuance of a title insurancepolicy. This condition is also satisfied whenever the person making a referralcan prove by a preponderance of the evidence that procedures reasonablyadopted to result in compliance with this condition have been maintainedthroughout the relevant period and that any failure to comply with thiscondition was unintentional and the result of a <T3>bona fide </T3>error. An error of legal judgment with respect to aperson's obligations under RESPA is not a<T3> bona fide </T3>error. Administrative and judicial interpretationsof section 130(c) of the Truth in Lending Act shall not be binding interpretationsof the preceding sentence or section 8(d)(3) of RESPA.(ii) No person making a referral has required (as defined in andSection;3500.2(i)) any person to use any particular provider of settlement servicesor business incident thereto, except (if such person is a lender) for requiringa buyer, borrower or seller to pay for the services of a particular providersuch as an attorney, credit reporting agency, or real estate appraiserchosen by the lender to represent the lender's interest in a real estatetransaction, or except (if such person is an attorney or law firm) forarranging for issuance of a title insurance policy, directly as agent orthrough a separate corporate title insurance agency that may be operatedas an adjunct to the law practice of the attorney or law firm, as partof representation of a client in a real estate transaction.(iii) The person making the payment has not given any thing of value otherthan things of value described in the preceding exemptions listed in andSection;3500.14(g)(1)-(5) of this part or a return on an ownership interest orfranchise relationship. Neither the mere labelling of a thing of value,nor the fact that it may be calculated pursuant to a corporate or partnershiporganizational document or a franchise agreement, will determine whetherit is a return on an ownership interest or franchise relationship. A returnon an ownership interest includes only payments intended as return on capitaland does not include any payment which has a basis of calculation or noapparent principal business motive other than distinguishing among recipientsof payments on the basis of the amount of their actual, estimated or anticipatedreferrals; any payment which varies according to the relative amount ofreferrals by the different recipients of similar payments; or a paymentbased on an ownership, partnership or joint venture share which has beenadjusted on the basis of previous relative referrals by recipients of similarpayments. A return on franchise relationship may be a payment to or froma franchisee but it does not include any payment which is not based onthe franchise agreement, nor any payment which varies according to theamount of referrals by the franchisor or franchisee or which is based ona franchise agreement which has been adjusted on the basis of a previousamount of referrals by the franchisor or franchisees.(c) <T3>Definitions</T3>.

Section 3500.2(i)of this part defines ``required'' use of a provider of a settlement service.Section 3500.19(c) of this part explains the liability of a seller fora violation of this section. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 3500.17 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Escrow accounts.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Limitations on settlement deposits and monthly deposits. </T3>If alender for a Federally related mortgage loan requires a borrower to depositsums in one or more escrow accounts (also called trust accounts, impoundaccounts, or similar names) for the purpose of assuring payment of taxes,hazard or mortgage insurance premiums, or other charges with respect tothe mortgage property, such sums may not exceed the following: (1) On or before the date of settlement, a lender may not require a borrowerto deposit an aggregate sum in an escrow account in excess of_(i) A sum that will be sufficient to pay that portion of each charge payablefrom the escrow account which is attributable to a period beginning onthe last date on which each such charge would have been paid under thenormal lending practice of the lender and local custom and ending on thedue date of the first full installment payment under the Federally relatedmortgage loan, and (ii) One-sixth of an amount which the lender reasonably estimates willbe the total amount of charges payable from the escrow account during thetwelve-month period following the date of settlement under the normal lendingpractice of the lender and local custom. (2) In any month including or following the due date of the first fullinstallment payment under the Federally related mortgage loan, a lendermay not require a borrower to deposit an aggregate sum in an escrow accountin excess of_(i) One-twelfth of an amount which the lender reasonably estimates willbe the total amount of such charges payable from the escrow account duringthe ensuing twelve-month period under the normal lending practice of thelender and local custom; (ii) Such amount as is necessary to maintain an additional balance in suchescrow account not to exceed twice the amount calculated under paragraph(a)(2)(i) of this section; and (iii) Any additional amount which the lender reasonably determines is necessaryto avoid or eliminate a deficiency which would preclude full payment fromthe escrow account of each charge payable from the escrow account on thedate a charge would be paid under the normal lending practice of the lenderand local custom. (b) <T3>Normal lending practice. </T3>``Normal lending practice of the lender'',as used in paragraph (a) of this section, does not include any lendingpractice which results in escrow accounts in excess of amounts requiredby ordinarily prudent lending practice in the locality. (c) <T3>Example of permitted practices under this section. </T3>For instance,where an annual tax of $1,200 ($100 a month) is paid on March 31 and thedate of settlement is June 15 with the first monthly installment due July1, the lender may require $500 on or before the June 15 settlement. Thissum is calculated as follows: The lender is allowed to collect $100 foreach month following the date taxes are normally paid (March 31), up to,but not including, the date of the first full mortgage payment (July 1).This constitutes a total of $300 for the months of April, May and June.An additional amount equivalent to two months' payment ($200) may alsobe required on or before the date of settlement. Thus, on June 15 the lendermay require $300 for the ``in-between'' months and $200 for ``cushion'',yielding $500. The remaining $700 tax balance is collected at $100 permonth for the remaining seven months.

The maintenance of any accountsreasonably needed by A in the normal course of its business would not bea violation of section 8.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. <T3>Facts. </T3>B, a lender of Federally related mortgage loans, pays A,a real estate agent, a fee of $25 per transaction purportedly for servicesperformed such as arranging for B's appraiser to visit the property. Thepurported services for which the fee is paid are services that real estateagents frequently perform as part of their services and the fee is reallyintended to enable B to compensate A for referring potential borrowersto B.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments. </T3>Both A and B are in violation of section 8 of RESPA,since the fee is being paid in compensation for the referral of businessrather than for legitimate services actually rendered by B on behalf ofA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. <T3>Facts.</T3> A, a provider of settlement services, provides settlementservices at abnormally low rates or at no charge at all to B, a builder,in connection with a subdivision being developed by B.

Section 8 does not apply tovoluntary payments by a borrower to A for assistance in locating a lender,provided that the voluntary payment is disclosed on both the good faithestimate of settlement costs and the HUD-1 settlement statement and thepayment is not a condition of the loan or other settlement service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. <T3>Facts.</T3> A, a title insurance company, provides among its otherservices an ``Insured Closing Service Letter''.

Section 8 does not prohibit variations in the amount of commissionsthat may be paid, not does it require that the quantum of services renderedbe identical in all cases, so long as services significant to the issuanceof a title insurance policy are rendered and the amount of the commissionbears a reasonable relationship to the services rendered.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. <T3>Facts. </T3>A, a real estate broker, refers title business to B, acompany that is a licensed title agent for C, a title insurance company.A is part owner of B.

B pays annual dividends toits owners, including A, based on the relative amount of business eachof its owners refers to B.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments. </T3>While the payments of a commission by C to B is nota violation of section 8 of RESPA if the amount of the commission constitutesreasonable compansation for the services performed by B for C, the paymentof a dividend or the giving of any other thing of value by B to A thatis based on the amount of business referred to B by A relative to the amountreferred by other owners constitutes a violation of section 8. Similarly,if the amount of stock held by A in B (or, if B were a partnership, thedistribution of partnership profits by B to A) varied based on the amountof business referred or expected to be referred, or if B retained any fundsfor subsequent distribution to A where such funds were generally in proportionto the amount of business A referred to B relative to the amount referredby other owners such arrangements would constitute violations of section8. The exemption for controlled business arrangements would not be availablebecause the payments here would not be considered returns on ownershipinterests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. <T3>Facts: </T3>Same as illustration 10, but B pays annual dividends inproportion to the amount of stock held by its owners, including A, andthe distribution of stock is not based on the amount of business referredor expected to be referred.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>The dividends are presumed to be, at least in part,payments for the referral of business. However, since the payment can beconsidered a return on ownership interests A and B will be exempt fromsection 8 if A did not require anyone to use the services of B, A disclosedits ownership interest in B and provided an estimate of B's charges toeach person referred by A to B, and B makes no payment (nor is there anyother thing of value exchanged) to A other than dividends.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. <T3>Facts: </T3>A, a franchisor for franchised real estate brokers, ownsB, a provider of settlement services. C, a franchisee of A, refers businessto B.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Any payments by A to C such as cash advances and anydividends from B to A are presumed to be, at least in part, for the referralof business to B. A, B and C will all be exempt from section 8 if C disclosedits franchise relationship with the owner of B and provided an estimateof B's charges to each person referred to B and C did not require anyoneto use the services of B and all A's payments to C are under the franchiseagreement and represent a return on the franchise relationship (ratherthan, <T3>e.g., </T3>being based on the referrals), and B makes no payments toA other than dividends representing a return on ownership interest (ratherthan, <T3>e.g., </T3>being based on the referrals).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. <T3>Facts: </T3>A holding company, A, owns subsidiaries B and C. B ownsD, a mortgage company, and C owns E, a real estate broker. D and E havea practice of referring business to each other.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>D and E are each owned by an ``associate'' of the other.Thus, dividends paid by B, C, D and E are presumed to be, at least in part,payments for the referral of business unless all elements of the appropriateexemption are satisfied. However, the fact that D and E have a practiceof referring business to each other means that the third element of theexemption cannot be met for dividends paid by D and E, since additional``things of value'' are being paid. D and E are each giving and receivinga ``thing of value'' by referring business.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. <T3>Facts: </T3>A, a franchisor, has franchise agreements with B and C,franchised real estate brokers located in different cities. B refers potentialbuyers moving to C's city to C.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T3>Comments: </T3>Section 8 would be violated if B's referral is pursuantto an agreement and if a thing of value is given pursuant to such agreement(for example, reciprocal referrals of business). However, the mere existenceof the arrangement described would not create any presumption that paymentsfrom A to B were pursuant to a referral agreement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="85">Appendix C_Sample Form of Good Faith Estimate</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">[Name of Lender] \1\</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The information provided below reflects estimates of the charges whichyou are likely to incur at the settlement of your loan.
