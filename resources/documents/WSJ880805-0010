The Software Publishers Association said sales of PC software rose 51% to $1.82 billion from $1.21 billion a year earlier.    The group said sales of software for personal computers made by International Business Machines Corp. and compatible makers, rose 44% to $1.39 billion, accounting for 76% of the market. Sales of software for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh line rose 130% to $192.3 million or 10.6% of the industry.    Most of the gains were in sales of productivity software for business tasks such as word processing and analyzing numbers, the group said. Productivity-software sales rose 59% and accounted for 82% of total sales.    Kenneth Wasch, executive director of the trade group, said the figures show that &quot;the microcomputer-software industry isn't even close to being a mature industry -- in fact, it hasn't yet reached adolescence.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
