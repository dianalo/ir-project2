Police said eight people were wounded.   On Wednesday, Israeli soldiers shot and killed three suspectedinfiltrators who crossed the border from Egypt, and mounted searchesin the Negev Desert for a fourth man who escaped, a militaryspokesman in Israel said today.   The Israeli army said today's raid was conducted to eliminate anAmal base used by Palestinian guerrillas who raided northern Isrealon Wednesday.   Lebanese police said the Israeli Cobra gunships struck at 8 a.m.,today hitting a four-story hilltop building used as an Amal commandpost in Bir el-Salassel near the village of Tibnin, 9{ miles northof the Israeli border.   ``The building took several direct rocket hits and was leveled,''said a police spokesman, who cannot be named under standingregulations. The Israelis said the helicopters had returned safely.   Tibnin is north of Israel's self-proclaimed security zone and isthe headquarters of the Irish battalion serving with the UnitedNations Interim Forces in Lebanon.   The air raid was Israel's first on an Amal base since 1985, whenthe Israeli army pulled back and established the 8-to-10-mile-widesecurity zone three years after invading Lebanon.   An Israeli military spokesman in Jerusalem said three Palestinianguerrillas had used the Amal base for an attempt to infiltrateIsrael Wednesday. They were killed by Israeli troops at the border.   The guerrillas belonged to the Palestine Liberation Front, asmall leftist faction supported by Syria, which also backs Amal.   Amal members from the base assisted the Palestinian guerrillas intheir attempt to sneak into Israel and attack an Israeli settlementon Wednesday, the Israeli army said.   In the clash near the Egyptian border on Wednesday, it was notimmediately clear if the infiltration involved guerrillas or,possibly, smugglers.   The Israeli army said no identification papers or weapons werefound on the three bodies. One military official said, however, thatthe possibility they were terrorists ``has not been ruled out.''   The last major infiltration from Egypt was in March, when threePalestinian guerrillas hijacked a bus and killed three Israelicivilians before they were shot to death. The PLO's Force 17 claimedresponsibility.   Soldiers first detected the infiltration Wednesday when theyfound footprints leading across Israel's southern border with Egypt,said a military spokesman, who cannot be identified by name underarmy rules.   In another development, The Washington Post, quoting Israelisources, said a group of armed Palestinians was trapped Wednesdaynight near the Jordanian border settlement of Ein Yahav. Unconfirmedreports said three members of the group were killed. However, anIsraeli army spokesman, asked if there were two infiltrations, said:``We have only the one we announced from Egypt.''   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said on Wednesday that Palestinianguerrillas are stepping up attacks against Israel partly because ofthe U.S. decision to talk to the PLO.   Shamir and other Israeli leaders in their recent statements havenot mentioned the deep divisions within the PLO, apparently in partbecause terror attacks pinned on the group help discredit thediplomatic initiative of PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.   Arafat, who heads the PLO's mainstream Fatah faction, saidearlier this month that he recognized Israel and renounced terror,and in return the United States dropped its refusal to talk to thePLO.</TEXT></DOC>
