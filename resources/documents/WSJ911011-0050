One writer in the Jerusalem Post this week summed up theprevailing mood among many here when he used a Yiddish wordfor someone who is always looking for a handout to lament,&quot;Doesn't it bother anyone that the Zionist state has becomethe world's biggest schnorrer?&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The new U.S. willingness to attach political conditions toits economic aid has shocked many Israelis. Even Israelis whodon't support continued settlements on the West Bank say theyare uncomfortable with the notion that U.S. economicsanctions, rather than Israeli public opinion, might forcechanges in Israeli behavior.   Last week, several politicians called for a nationwide&quot;belt-tightening&quot; program that would help give Israel theability to forgo not only the loan guarantees but the $3billion a year that Israel now receives in military aid andassistance in repaying previous debts.   Foreign Minister David Levy suggested that Israelis takevoluntary 10% wage cuts to help the settlement drivecontinue. Another minister proposed that cabinet members andtheir deputies agree to similar cuts in their own salaries asa first step in broader economic reforms.   Underlying these proposals is a belief that if the U.S.turns off the spigot, Israel will finally curb its profligateways and begin making unpopular political choices that thegovernment has managed to avoid while the U.S. has picked upthe bill. But many economists contend that even major changeswon't necessarily precipitate the kind of reforms that arenecessary for continued recovery.   &quot;I think it is an optimistic view to say that thegovernment would sell off inefficient industries and makehard choices if aid was stopped or slowed down,&quot; says DoreGold, who heads the U.S. desk at the Jaffee Center forStrategic Studies. &quot;I think the more probable reaction wouldbe far heavier taxation.&quot;   Moreover, Israeli economists agree that a nationwide 10%wage cut wouldn't be enough to make up for a sharp reductionin aid. Says Eli Sagi, director of Economic Models Ltd., aRamat Gan-based forecasting firm, &quot;The drop in the Israelistandard of living would be very sharp.&quot;   Uriel Lynn, chairman of the Israeli Parliament's lawcommittee, says Israel won't be able to wean itself fromforeign aid unless the country speeds up its program to selloff state-owned companies, reduces its public sector workforce, and cuts the budget.   But Mr. Lynn is pessimistic that any of these things canbe done without undertaking political reform as well. &quot;Underthe current system, because small parties have so much powerthe government isn't strong enough to make unpopularchanges,&quot; he says.   There is a growing sense that the current rift with theU.S. may awaken Israel to the need for long-term change. &quot;Toomany people had gotten used to the idea that we could buildour economy on continued U.S. aid,&quot; says Mr. Lynn. &quot;Now Ihope people will realize that we have to help ourselves.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
