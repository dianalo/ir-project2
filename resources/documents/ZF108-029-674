(MBS) of Braintree, Mass., which offers amicrowave product it says can connect remote LANs at low cost and maintainthe 10-megabit/sec speed of Ethernet.andM;Now, I've no particular ax to grind, pro or con, about using microwave forshort-haul data connectivity over rough or difficult terrain.andP;  Even with itsobvious weaknesses in security and adverses weather conditions, microwavetechnology can be efficient and less-expensive under the right conditions.andO;But for bridging LANs at 10 megabits/sec?andP;  Unheard of.andM;Typically, most non-microwave LAN-to-LAN solutions involve interLAN bridgesor gateways, devices that pass data traffic from one LAN to the other overpublic or private telephone lines.andM;The problem is they are too costly, too slow, or both.andP;  It's not that thebridging hardware itself is so expensive.andP;  But the installation costs forcrossing a city street or river with dedicated data lines can be prohibitive,not to mention the recurring monthly charges which, like death and taxes,will last forever.andM;As for speed, well, who wants to give up full Ethernet throughput for acostly dedicated 56-kilobit/sec connection, or a faster but still costly T1circuit?andM;The president of MBS, David S. Theodore, said his product solves theLAN-to-LAN cost/speed conundrum because it was designed with the needs ofEthernet users in mind.andP;  The problem with most microwave manufacturers, hesaid, is that they are out of tune with LAN technology.andP;  Having dismissedEthernet as a &quot;special&quot; application, they have focused mainly on T1 or56-kilobit/sec channels for all data requirements.andM;Not so with MBS.andP;  The company focuses on extending the range of a typical LANvia a microwave bridge.andP;  This means that, by using an MBS turnkey microwavesystem, you ought to be able to link your cross-campus or cross-town EthernetLANs at full speed as effectively as if you were using an Ethernet coaxialcable within a single building.andM;MBS has developed an Ethernet-to-microwave interface, the EtherwaveTransceiver.andM;This is a LAN/microwave interface which, combined with MBS' LAN-Link 1000Bridge, provides 10-megabit/sec throughput between multivendor Ethernet LANsfor distances of up to five miles without a repeater (14 miles with amicrowave repeater).andM;Basically, if you momentarily forget that you're transmitting via microwave,the Etherwave device acts like a standard Ethernet network transceiver.andP;  Butbecause microwave radio is involved, the device connects to a LAN bridge and,by using it as a power source, converts digital signals to analog input forconversion at the other end.andM;Because the LAN-Link 1000 Bridge operates at the data link level it isprotocol-independent.andP;  Therefore, it can handle most popular protocols, suchas DECnet and TCP/IP, without external software and without losing Ethernetspeed.andM;The entire MBS package is less than $45,000 with licensing and training.andM;J.B.andP;  Miles writes about networking and wide area communications from SanFrancisco.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
