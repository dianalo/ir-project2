That's the simple part; the rest is troubling andcomplex.;    The fall of the Richmond schools into bankruptcy is not the faultof the state, although it provides much of the money to run Richmond and everyother public school district. The leadership of the district embarked on anambitious program when the grants to fund it were but a gleam in thesuperintendent's eye.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  RICHMOND'S TRADE-OFFIF THE STATE BAILS OUT BANKRUPT SCHOOLS,TRUSTEES SHOULD SURRENDER CONTROL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Editorials  </MEMO><TEXT>     To require the state to rescue every district run amok is to invitedistricts to write budgets guided by the principle that something will turnup.;    That's why Gov. Pete Wilson is appealing the Superior Court judge'sorder to keep the schools open at state expense.;    A spokesman for thegovernor said the order &quot;tosses accountability out the window . . . and sets aterrible precedent that the governor is concerned about.&quot;;    He's right towant to knock this precedent down. The governor, not the judge, has to findthe money.;    If the trustees of the Richmond district are to be relieved ofa problem they created, they should be relieved of the administration of thedistrict as well.;    A bill by Assemblyman Robert Campbell, D-Richmond, wouldpay the district finances through June 14 and also put Bill Honig, the statesuperintendent of schools, in charge of the district.;    Those in Sacramentowho pay Richmond's IOUs should insist on this approach. So should other schooldistricts. The fund into which the state will dip for $19 million to bail outRichmond almost certainly will be one which otherwise would have beendistributed to other school districts that didn't spend themselves intoinsolvency.;    Richmond parents may rue the day they won in court and keptthe schools open. Already the district is being guided by a state-appointedtrustee. The judge's order doesn't change the fact that Richmond schools willhave to make dramatic cuts to match programs to revenues next year.;    If thestate bails the district out, chances are the decisions about those cuts arenot going to be made in Richmond.  </TEXT><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910501  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  May  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  359  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday May 1, 199100122106,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
