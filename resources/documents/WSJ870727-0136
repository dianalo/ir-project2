American spies in novels act because they are greedy supermen (as in the works of Robert Ludlum or Eric van Lustbader); British novelists follow John le Carre's lead and portray their spies as unscrupulous bureaucrats. To have a hero act to defend his country or uphold his honor would be considered antique by most current spy novelists.    Australian novelist Robert Moss originally worked in the le Carre tradition. A former editor of the Economist, he wrote his novels (the first two in collaboration with Arnaud de Borchgrave, now editor of the Washington Times), as tough, ruthless exposes of communist and liberal media conspiracies. They were slick, but Mr. Moss's persistent didacticism detracted from the plot.    With his fifth novel, &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; (Villard, 498 pages, $18.95), Mr. Moss chooses to escape our unsavory age by setting his novel in the 1930s. He continues his anti-communism here, focusing this time on the growth of the Comintern; but he supplements his lectures on Soviet disinformation with a romantic plot reminiscent of John Buchan.    &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; is the story of Johnny Lentz. Disillusioned by Germany's collapse after the First World War, Lentz joins the Spartacist revolt of 1919 and becomes a fervent communist. As Lentz rises in the Comintern, he watches communist forces impotently allow Hitler's rise to power and he learns Realpolitik from Joseph Stalin himself.    The first third of the book tries to show why Lentz abandons communism and defects to the British. This section is the least interesting; Mr. Moss strains to replicate the great anti-communist memoirs of the '40s and '50s (particularly Arthur Koestler's), but his scenes are too preachy, and lack the conviction of the original works. There is little in this part of &quot;Carnival&quot; that students of the period will not already know. (Mixing scenes reminiscent of &quot;Darkness at Noon&quot; with sadistic pornography does not help matters.)    It is only when Lentz leaves Germany to help plan a communist takeover of Brazil that &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; acquires new life. For Brazil is a country that was an important strategic battleground in the '30s, one of the few nations where both fascists (supported by a large number of German immigrants) and communists had enough political strength to attempt coups. Brazil, however, is unfamiliar territory to the spy novelist. Most prefer to set their books in European or American locales.    The most convincing sections of the novel depict the events that led to the Brazilian communist rising of 1936. Unlike the sections in Germany, where Mr. Moss seems mostly to have relied on secondary sources, the Brazilian sections are based on extensive interviews and research into communist files now part of Brazilian police archives.    Mr. Moss is at his best when he describes practical politics, when writing about the feuds between rival communist factions in a sleepy provincial capital. The most believable characters in &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; are those whose souls barely cover their secrets, such as the mayor of Rio, the sinister Doctor Alcibiades, who double-crosses every major character in the book at least once. Even the minor communist plotters (such as the diabolical bandit, Captain Electrico) are sharply drawn.    But not all the Brazilian characters are humorless. Mr. Moss shows a welcome talent for comedy; his description of the bungled takeover of a quiet tropical resort, for example, has many droll moments.    Mr. Moss tries to make the Brazilian sections of &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; into a romance in the tradition of John Buchan. (The reader knows this because the British agents who handle Lentz keep telling themselves to quit acting like characters from Buchan novels.) Mr. Moss clearly had fun creating his club-land heroes, quaint enough to prefer Playfair ciphers over sophisticated decoding machines, but loyal to king and country and mercifully free of bitterness and self-doubt. Occasionally the action also slips into Buchan country; no one bounds across a moor, but there is a lyric chase on horseback across the savanna of southwestern Brazil.    Occasionally &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; does not ring true. The heroes tend to be too smug; when off-duty, his MI6 operatives turn into conceited backslappers, full of self-congratulation about their public schools and the Secret Service. While the communists are plausibly evil, his Nazis (both Brazilian and German) lack genuine menace, acting like escapees from an unperformable comic opera. The numerous scenes of torture and sadism that litter the text detract from the story.    Despite its flaws, however, &quot;Carnival of Spies&quot; is an enjoyable romp through a long-lost era. I'd hate to see Mr. Moss do a sequel, but if, in his next book, he could graft '30s virtues onto modern characters, he will have done the spy novel a great service.    ---   Mr. Wooster is an associate editor of the Wilson Quarterly. </TEXT></DOC>
