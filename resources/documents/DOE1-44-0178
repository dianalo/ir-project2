Two Repeat Formation Tester (RFT) surveys were performedin the observation well at a pre-designed interval. The second RFT surveywas performed after the pulsed well was put back on production. The designwas based on an older, history-matched model of the reef. A geologicaland stratigraphic interpretation was performed to update the geologicaland the numerical model. Subsequently, a three-dimensional, three-phase,single equation numerical simulator was used to model the inter-wellarea and a history match was obtained to the pressure shift in the twoRFT surveys. The vertical pressure profiles from the RFT surveys identifiesbarriers to vertical flow while the geological interpretation and thehistory match to the pressure shift provided a quantitative distributionof horizontal and vertical permeabilities in the inter-well area.</TEXT></DOC>
