But diplomats say Iraq's efforts to restart development projects and respond to its long-suffering consumers will be hindered by foreign debt estimated at between $70 billion and $85 billion and recurring payment problems.    Iraqi leaders greeted the cease-fire by flooding local shops with goods they had been saving in warehouses for years to reward their 16 million people.    Iraqis jammed state stores and the trade ministry announced that it sold millions of dollars of television sets, refrigerators and other luxury items during the following six days.    In the weeks that followed, South Korean television sets, Taiwanese cassette players and imported clothes flooded shop windows -- apparently the harvest of a new policy that allows businessmen to import goods with foreign currency held abroad.    Prices for imports plunged locally as the post-war Iraqi dinar soared on foreign markets, although the dinar's free-market value remains at only about one-third of the government's official rate.    Diplomats said it wasn't clear whether the consumer bonanza would last.    Economic analysts said private Iraqi citizens hold $60 billion or more abroad. But they added that government limits on sending profits abroad damp the attraction of devoting such money to investments or imports.    Iraq is short of foreign currency needed to bring in imports and it has a massive shopping list of industrial projects.    As much as $3 billion is earmarked for rebuilding and developing the war-battered southern city of Basra, the country's main port. Much of it was pounded to rubble by Iranian missiles and artillery.    Iraq also faces a costly but essential two to five-year effort to dredge and clear the waterways to its main ports at Basra and Umm Qasr to the west.    The London-based Middle East Economic Digest said Iraq had deferred as much as $50 billion of projects between 1981 and 1985, and diplomats say Iraq intends to revive many of them.    At the top of the list: steel, aluminum, fertilizer and cement plants.    Some factories completed before the war, but never used, must be renovated before they can begin production.    In late July, Iraq signed a consulting contract for a $2 billion petrochemical complex and asked bids on two major power stations.    The country plans to build a long North-South oil pipeline and has annnounced plans to develop several new oil fields.    Iraq also must rebuild its devastated oil-storage facilities at Faw, held by the Iranians for two years, in order to resume shipping oil through the Persian Gulf -- an urgent priority for Iraq.    By the end of next year, oil analysts say, reopened shipping outlets through the gulf, plus a new pipeline, are expected to give Iraq the ability to export about 5.5 million barrels of oil a day, although its quota by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, probably will be about 2.3 million barrels to 2.4 million barrels daily -- roughly what it can export now.    Oil exports bring in $12 billion to $14 billion a year. Debt repayment eats up about $2 billion to $4 billion of that and the military about $5 billion -- an amount that will remain high in the immediate, tense post-war period.    &quot;That doesn't leave a lot of money,&quot; said a Western diplomat, who, like his colleagues, requested anonymity.    Domestic private consumption has been eating up about $3 billion or more a year, even during the war.    Diplomats said Iraq already has been rescheduling debt and seeking new credits, apparently attempting to get new money in return for paying back the old.    &quot;I think what we'll see is a lot of debt servicing, but I don't think we'll see a lot of debts being repaid,&quot; said a European diplomat.    Iraq owes about $4 billion to Turkey and billions more to Japan, Italy, South Korea, West Germany and other Western countries. It also owes money to the Soviet Union and Eastern bloc nations but the amount wasn't disclosed.    Diplomats said that efforts to arrange repayment plans remained stalled in almost all cases. But they added that Iraq has improved its record of paying contractors, who in recent years often experienced long delays that threatened to put some out of business.    Iraq's 100 billion barrels of proven oil reserves also reassure creditors. Only Saudi Arabia has more.    Businessmen already are beginnning to contact embassies about local opportunities, diplomats said. The chairman of South Korea's Hyundai Corp. recently spent several days in Baghdad meeting with top officials.    &quot;Now's the time to be looking at Iraq as a potential market. There's a lot happening here,&quot; one diplomat said.    But a European colleague urged businessmen to be careful about financing.&quot;There are plenty of risky opportunities,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
