He was 86.   Simenon died Monday night, according to a Lausanne funeral home,Pompes Funebres Generales. His family gave instructions for aprivate funeral today, a spokesman for the funeral home said oncondition of anonymity.   No cause of death was given, but Simenon had been ailing for sometime. He died peacefully, a spokeswoman at his Lausanne office said.   The author stipulated that his ashes join those of his daughterand favorite child, Marie-Jo, under a 250-year-old cedar outside hishouse. She committed suicide in 1978 at age 25.   ``I don't fear death, but I fear causing trouble by my death tothose who survive me,'' Simenon once said. ``I would like to die asdiscreetly as possible.''   Jean Richard, the French actor who played Inspector Maigret indozens of television films over 23 years, said of Simenon: ``For me,he was the greatest popular French author without comparison. He wasthe new Balzac.''   The official Soviet news agency Tass eulogized Simenon in a briefobituary as a ``master detective story writer.'' Maigret, thecontemplative Paris policeman, is a favorite of millions of Soviets.Some of his adventures were recently reprinted by the popular weeklymagazine Ogonyok.   A Belgian native, Simenon wrote 80 books featuring Maigret, thecompassionate, pipe-smoking Paris chief inspector who seeks tounderstand criminals rather than condemn them.   While best known for the immensely popular ``Maigrets,'' hepersonally preferred the 132 ``non-Maigrets,'' psychological,sometimes nightmarish novels about people in crisis that put hisname into literary encyclopedias.   His books were translated into 55 languages, including Chinese,Armenian and Yiddish, in 40 countries. In the Soviet Union some ofhis novels had initial editions of 500,000 copies and his revealing``Letter To My Mother'' is obligatory reading in French-languageschool lessons.   At the start of his career, Simenon also wrote about 300 pulpfiction novels under more than 20 pseudonyms.   A 1973 survey by UNESCO said sales of Simenon books totaled morethan half a billion worldwide. The books provided the basis for 52feature movies and more than 300 television films. Charles Laughton,Jean Gabin and Heinz Ruehmann were among the 22 actors who playedMaigret.   About 50 biographies have been written about Simenon. His Pariseditor published 21 volumes of ``Dictees'' (Dictations), transcriptsof reflections and reminiscences tape-recorded during an eight-yearperiod when Simenon suffered from an ear condition that upset hissense of balance.   Apart from writing, which he called ``forced labor,'' Simenonsaid he spent most of his life ``obsessed by a frantic sexuality.''   In two 1977 interviews, he said he had slept with 10,000 women,sometimes at the pace of three a day, ``to learn the truth'' about``The Woman.''   His fortune is estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars,and a battle could develop over it. His will, he told the Belgiannewspaper Le Soir in 1978, would be ``so precise that many peoplewill be shocked.''   To avoid a costly settlement, he refused to divorce his secondwife Denise.   Simenon stipulated that his ashes join those of his daughter andfavorite child, Marie-Jo, under a 250-year-old cedar outside hishouse. She committed suicide in 1978 at age 25.   In 1981, his ``Intimate Memoirs'' came out, by far the thickestbook to carry his name, which he said would be the last to bepublished during his lifetime.   It was sparked by the suicide of his daughter and tells atempestuous story of despair and happiness, of love and sex, ofluxury and the longing to return to what he calls ``the littlepeople'' of his home country.   Simenon was repeatedly said to be a candidate for the Nobel Prizein literature.   A friend, the late French Nobel laureate Andre Gide, describedSimenon as ``the most novelistic of novelists in French literaturetoday.''   The older of two children, Simenon was born Feb. 13, 1903, in theBelgian town of Liege, shortly after midnight on a Friday. But hissuperstitious mother, of upper-class Dutch-German ancestry, had thedate officially registered as Feb. 12.   The mother, outwardly fretful but inwardly iron-willed, left adeep imprint on his work, as revealed in ``Pedigree,'' a firstautobiography covering his youth, and in ``Letter To My Mother.''   His father, who suffered from a heart condition, was anunambitious insurance company clerk of Breton descent.   Simenon quit school at 16, going to work as a baker's apprenticeand a bookstore clerk before becoming a reporter for a localnewspaper. That career ended after a satire on his superiors and hisfamily, including his wealthy uncle who never spoke to him again.   After the death of his father, Simenon moved to Paris in 1922 andbegan churning out novels at a rate of 80 pages a day, chiefly forconsumption by housewives. He wrote anything that sold, fromsentimental stories to adventure books and travelogues, drawing hisbasic information from the Larousse encyclopedia.   In three years, he made enough to rent a chic apartment and own achauffeur-driven car and a yacht. His first efforts in seriousliterature drew encouragement from the French writer Colette, thenliterary editor of the Le Matin newspaper.   After World War II, he lived for several years in the UnitedStates and Canada, where he produced some of his finest works. Inthe early 1960s, Simenon reached a furious peak, writing up to sixbooks a year.   In the United States, he divored his French-born first wife of 27years, Regine, and married Denise Quimet, a Canadian. They settledin Epalinges, Switzerland, in a 26-room mansion.   In his ``Intimate Memoirs,'' Simenon described that marriage asan ``infernal symphony'' that once made him so desperate hecontemplated suicide. The two separated in 1969, with her drawingalimony payments he said were higher than the salary of a Frenchprime minister.   For most of his life, he remarked in one ``Dictee,'' Simenon was``obsessed by a frantic sexuality.''   Only after meeting Teresa, Denise's Venice-born chambermaid whowas 20 years his junior, did he find ``complete harmony,'' herelated once. They moved into the ``Maison Rose'' at Lausanne, aplainly furnished farmhouse dwarfed by high-rise condominiums andthe 250-year-old cedar.   Simenon is survived by Teresa, Denise and his first wife, Regine,as well as three sons.</TEXT></DOC>
