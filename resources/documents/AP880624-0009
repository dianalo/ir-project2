I'm here to witness to that.AIDS is not a `we,' `they' disease, it's an `us' disease,'' Ms.LaFavor says in messages broadcast since October and in packetsmailed this month.   In January, doctors told the 40-year-old single mother fromMinneapolis she had six weeks to live. Doctors can't explain whythey were wrong, but Ms. LaFavor says educating others gives her apurpose.   ``It is one of the reasons why I am alive. It is an importantvocation,'' she said.   ``Everybody says it's important for people to see the faces andhear the voices of the people who have the disease and so that'swhy I do it. If one person can be prevented from getting thedisease by any one thing I say, it's worth it,'' she said.   Ms. LaFavor learned she had AIDS-related complex in the fall of1986. She says she engaged in a lot of unsafe behavior, includingsharing needles with other drug abusers, until she was caughtstealing drugs from the hospital where she worked as a registerednurse.   Counseling helped. And she worked a year and a half as achemical dependency counselor until AIDS struck and she was forcedonto medical disability.   Six months ago, she and four other people, including anotherAIDS sufferer, founded Spirits Alive, which trains people to teachothers about acquired immune deficiency syndrome, a deadly diseasefor which there is no known cure.   She also surrendered some of her privacy to appear in the publicservice announcements and mailings, produced at the direction ofthe U.S. Centers for Disease Control.   ``If those of us who have it aren't willing to talk about it,we're not going to be able to get the word out as effectively,''said Ms. LaFavor, a woman with a face creased with lines whoappears older than her 40 years. She is identified only as Carolein the mailings.   While she agreed to be identified by her full name in aninterview, Ms. LaFavor said she was leery about having it printedin the brochures.   ``I was trying to protect my daughter's confidentiality. I sortof figure I can handle the negative things, but it's not fair forher to have to. Thankfully, that hasn't happened,'' Ms. LaFavorsaid.   Instead, she says, she has received support.   A young friend of her 9-year-old adopted daughter, Theresa,offered sympathy after seeing Ms. LaFavor in the public serviceannouncements.   ``She said, `I hope your Mom doesn't die.' I think that's apretty sensitive thing for a 9-year-old child to say. Theresa feltsupported by it,'' said Ms. LaFavor, who has made arrangements fora friend to adopt her daughter.   Ms. LaFavor said she felt the ads were making an impact when awoman in a hair-styling salon slipped her a note as she was leaving.   ``She said she had seen me on TV and that for the first time ithad really caused her to stop and think about her own behavior andabout the whole issue of AIDS,'' said Ms. LaFavor.   She received about $1,000 for the public service announcements.For the approximately 75 speeches she has given in the last year,mostly to health organizations and American Indian groups, Ms.LaFavor, an Ojibwe Indian, received only payment for expenses.   Offers to speak have increased since she made the public serviceannouncements, but she said she has to choose carefully because shefatigues easily and doesn't want to spend too much time far awayfrom her daughter.   Ms. LaFavor, still wiry, says she most misses running andstaying athletic since she got AIDS. Her home, decorated withIndian art objects, is in a working-class neighborhood of southMinneapolis.   Ms. LaFavor was among about 30 people contacted through AIDSeducation groups and interviewed last year for the broadcastannouncements and brochures. ``People who see her say they aresurprised she has AIDS, that she seems she's somebody they wouldlike to know,'' said Stephen Heller, vice president and creativedirector at Ogilvy andamp; Mather Advertising's Atlanta office. ``They'resurprised she has AIDS because she doesn't fit the stereotypes.''</TEXT></DOC>
