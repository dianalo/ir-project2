The long-awaited draft guidelines, in preparation for more than two years, emphasize and, for the first time, clarify the Reagan administration's unwillingness to intervene in international business ventures unless they clearly have a &quot;direct, substantial and reasonably foreseeable anticompetitive effect&quot; on U.S. consumers.    The 186-page draft, among other things, indicates that a joint venture that excludes major competitors in a specific industry &quot;rarely is anticompetitive&quot; and, unlike some past cases, almost certainly wouldn't be challenged by the Justice Department. The guidelines also stress that patents, licenses and other intellectual property rights -- assumed by some previous administrations to sometimes conflict with antitrust laws and promote monopolies -- now generally are considered pro-competitive by the department, because they encourage &quot;the efficient development and use&quot; of innovative technology.    In an interview yesterday, Assistant Attorney General Charles Rule, who heads the Antitrust Division, said this is the approach that is the &quot;most radically different&quot; from the previous guidelines. Instead of listing nine specific licensing practices &quot;that automatically were considered unlawful&quot; under those criteria, he explained, the draft calls for &quot;analyzing the economic effects of technology licensing&quot; case-by-case.    While much of the document deals with hypothetical examples and the legal analysis isn't binding on federal or state courts, the guidelines, taken together, nevertheless represent important building blocks in the antitrust legacy the agency's top officials hope to put in place during the administration's last months.    &quot;It isn't just a restatement or updating of the law&quot; affecting international business, said Diane Wood, a University of Chicago law professor who worked on the project as a consultant for the agency. Rather, she asserted, &quot;the guidelines really indicate what the administration would like the law to look like&quot; in coming years.    The Justice Department stirred up a political hornet's nest in December 1984, when it issued non-binding guidelines supporting the legality of most marketing restrictions manufacturers impose on wholesalers or retailers. State attorneys general sharply criticized the agency and eventually issued their own, more stringent guidelines, while many lawmakers objected to implementation of the Justice Department's standards.    A number of private antitrust lawyers, who haven't had time yet to study the international guidelines, said it isn't clear how much impact they will have on day-to-day Justice Department operations.    The guidelines, expected to become final after a 60-day public comment period, would replace 1977 guidelines that the department contends have become outdated by legislative changes, court rulings and &quot;advances in economic and legal thinking.&quot; The Justice Department has been using some of the revised principles for years, but the draft released yesterday is the first comprehensive summary and analysis of the recent developments.    Stressing that &quot;the vast majority of international business transactions&quot; never &quot;raise antitrust concerns,&quot; the guidelines nevertheless give antitrust enforcers greater leeway to rely on diplomatic, foreign policy and other noneconomic factors to allow certain activities by foreign companies doing business in the U.S.    The agency, for example, said &quot;considerations of international comity&quot; and other noneconomic factors may block U.S. antitrust challenges to export restraints or voluntary quotas by foreign manufacturers, whether those constraints are directly imposed or instigated by a foreign government.    &quot;Indeed,&quot; according to the guidelines, &quot;it would be anomalous&quot; to challenge the legality of such controls when the U.S. &quot;can be found negotiating for certain exports restraints.&quot;    One of the most controversial proposals, according to Ms. Wood, is likely to be the concept of allowing defendants in private and federal antitrust suits to use separate criteria to justify participating in suspected anticompetitive activities at the behest of foreign governments.    The completion of the document has been delayed many months by Justice Department turnover and internal agency disagreements, combined with consultations with officials at the Federal Trade Commission and the office of the U.S. trade representative. </TEXT></DOC>
