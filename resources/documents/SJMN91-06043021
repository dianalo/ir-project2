Then, in late December, the figure began surging. ByJan. 28, the latest available, cash held had jumped to $254.3 billion, FederalReserve Bank of St. Louis data show.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  WORRIED PUBLIC APPARENTLY HAS STARTED TOHOARD CASH  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Marketbeat  </MEMO><TEXT>     Lacy Hunt, economist for Hongkong Bank group in New York, calls the sharprise in currency holdings &quot;extraordinary. . . . The surge is so abnormal thatit suggests people are withdrawing money from banks and thrifts and literallyputting the cash in mattresses, the back yard, safes in the home or somethingcomparable.&quot;;    The war certainly has frightened many people. And theeconomy's slide into recession -- with the accompanying jump in layoffs -- mayhave persuaded more people to mothball their credit cards, economists say.Instead, consumers may be keeping more cash from their paychecks and livingonly within their means each week.;    It is also likely that confidence inthe banking system was badly shaken by the failure of some privately insuredRhode Island credit unions and the Bank of New England in January. Somedepositors probably figure that they are better off burying their savings inthe back yard.;    Gary Schlossberg, economist at Wells Fargo in SanFrancisco, says that some of the increase in cash outstanding also stems fromthe growing use of U.S. currency as a proxy for local currencies in troubledcountries, such as in South America. If you are an Argentine, you would muchrather hold dollars than your own rapidly deflating australs.;    Cashhoarding may not seem like a problem for the economy, but it could be a bigone: The Federal Reserve is trying to rejuvenate lending by pumping more moneyinto the banking system. If depositors continue to withdraw cash from banks,however, they drain away a lot of what the Fed pumps in. So if you see yourneighbors in the back yard with shovels -- that could be the economic recoverythat they're burying.; (hbox);    Los Angeles brokerage Bateman Eichler, HillRichards is disbanding most or all of its securities analyst team.;   Bateman's parent, Chicago-based Kemper Corp., has fired four of the eightBateman analysts. The other four have been offered posts on a new Kemperanalyst team to have its headquarters in Chicago. The cuts had been rumoredfor weeks.;    Kemper, which also owns brokerages in Denver, Houston,Milwaukee and Cleveland, has been losing big money on those operations as thesecurities business has slumped. To cut costs, Kemper has increasinglycentralized control of the brokerage units in Chicago. The units had operatedmore or less independently in the 1980s.;    As of last summer, Bateman hadthe biggest stock research staff of any Los Angeles brokerage, with 12analysts. The number had dwindled to eight with layoffs and defections inrecent months.;    Bateman insiders say that the four remaining analysts willalmost certainly have to move to Chicago to keep their jobs. The four won'tdiscuss their plans, and Kemper officials in Chicago won't say what's next.Allan Sher, head of Kemper's Western retail operations, said some analystsmight remain in Los Angeles, &quot;but I'm not sure.&quot;;    Does it matter that L.A.loses the Bateman team? Michael Abrahams, who had followed bank stocks forBateman, was cut. He says that Kemper is making a mistake pulling analysts outof their regions. Abrahams argues that a centralized staff in Chicago won'thave the same ability to ferret out local stocks of interest to investors in aregion.;    But Sher argues that centralizing the research team will meanbrokers at each Kemper securities brokerage will have access to all analystresearch, not just that of their region.;    Some Bateman brokers agree thatcentralizing research will give them more ideas to work with. And some say itwon't matter much what Kemper does, because brokers everywhere are notoriousfor ignoring their own analysts' research anyway. &quot;Every broker I know thinkstheir own firm's research stinks, and that it's always better somewhere else,&quot;says one Bateman broker.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TOM PETRUNO, Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Street  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910212  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  697  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday February 12, 199100043021,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
