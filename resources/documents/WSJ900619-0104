The items involved include krytrons and spark gaps,electronic switching devices that were at the center of amajor flap in March when U.S. and British customs officersarrested six members of an Iraqi ring. The six allegedly wereattempting to put packages containing the parts on a Londonplane bound for Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   The change in export rules, according to a spokeswoman forthe Commerce Department's Bureau of Export Administration,would allow shipment of various previously restricted itemsto &quot;certain reliable Eastern European countries like Poland,Hungary and Czechoslovakia.&quot; The U.S., she said, hopes tonegotiate safeguard procedures &quot;by which those countriesclosely monitor the end use of such items.&quot;   But critics of the move charge that the relaxation couldaccelerate the nuclear arms race in the Middle East. &quot;Thismeans that Iraq can order U.S. bomb triggers through frontcompanies in Eastern Europe without breaking any laws,&quot;asserted Gary Milhollin, head of the Wisconsin Project onNuclear Arms Control, a Washington research firm.   The Paris-based Coordinating Committee for MultilateralExport Controls (COCOM), approved the deletion of 30categories of technology from its export-control list twoweeks ago. At least six of the categories, according to Mr.Milhollin, were previously banned because they could be usedto make nuclear weapons or guided missiles to carry them.   &quot;This points to the need for Cocom to start looking atNorth-South proliferation,&quot; said Rep. Samuel Gejdenson (D.,Conn.), chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee thatoversees international economic policy. &quot;The real nationalsecurity risk we now face is Iran, Iraq, Syria and Libya.&quot;   The congressman added that he welcomes increased tradewith the East bloc as long as it doesn't create securityrisks elsewhere.   Iraq has established front businesses in Europe to shopfor controlled military technology, following the example ofPakistan, which used a network of phony West German-basedcompanies during the 1980's to buy a large amount ofnuclear-weapons technology illegally.   While West Germany and other Western European nations nowinsist that these avenues are closed, allowing the technologyto flow into Eastern Europe will create more of them,according to Mr. Milhollin. He told a Senate ForeignRelations Committee panel last week that &quot;these cash-starvedand capital-poor regimes do not have functioningexport-control systems. There will be a great risk that theircompanies will break the conditions of sale even ifconditions are imposed.&quot;   The technology involved in the changes includes spinforming machines, which can be used to make high-speedcentrifuges for uranium enrichment, sophisticatedoscilloscopes, telemetry equipment and assemblies of quartzcrystals, all of which were previously controlled becausethey could be used to develop missile-guidance systems.   U.S. controls banning direct sale to proliferation-pronecountries remain in effect, according to the CommerceDepartment.   The best-known item removed from the 17-nation Cocom'scontrols is probably krytrons, fast switching devices thathave featured in previous U.S. criminal cases againstPakistani agents who tried to smuggle them out of the countryand an Israeli agent who succeeded.   Krytrons are used in a variety of commercial devices,including copying machines, but more sophisticated versionshave been used in the trigger mechanisms of U.S. nuclearweapons, which require exact timing of electronicallytriggered explosive charges.   Donald M. Kerr, president of EGandamp;G Inc. of Wellesley,Mass., the only U.S. manufacturer of krytrons, says heapplauds the Cocom decision because krytrons have widespreadcommercial uses. &quot;To recognize that this is 50-year-oldtechnology seems to be sensible,&quot; he said. Linking thetechnology to nuclear-bomb making, he asserted, is &quot;akin tosaying if you have a cigarette lighter, from that you mightget a car.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
