The European jetliner consortium reported an operatingsurplus for 1990 -- the first in its 20-year history.Officials declined to disclose the sum, but sources said thesurplus was between $100 million and $150 million on revenueof $4.6 billion, despite an anemic dollar.</LP><TEXT>   The future, however, looks increasingly uncertain. AirbusManaging Director Jean Pierson told a news conference herethat Mideast difficulties may force airlines there to deferdeliveries or cancel orders outright. The airline industryworld-wide is already weak, with bankruptcy-law filings inthe U.S., slowing traffic growth, and a credit squeeze. Iffuel prices continue at current high levels, it could getworse. Mr. Pierson said the consortium's 1991 surplus willtop last year's figure. Revenue this year should reach nearly$7 billion and some 170 planes are expected to be delivered,up from only 95 in 1990, he said, barring a crisis. But hewarned that orders in 1991 will probably decline from 1990.   The parlous state of some U.S. carriers has provided themost recent bad news. Just this week Pan Am Corp. filed forprotection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S.Bankruptcy Code. The parent of Pan American World Airways is$34 million in arrears to Airbus for lease payments on 21jetliners. Airbus moved in December to protect the planes,which Pan Am has flown since 1985.   The European consortium, worried that Pan Am hadn't paidback lease payments with proceeds from the sale of itsinternal German routes to Lufthansa and fearing that the U.S.carrier would declare bankruptcy, on Dec. 19 called a specialboard meeting at Le Bourget Airport in Paris. Sources say theboard voted to terminate Pan Am's long-term lease andsubstitute a one-month agreement, which expires Jan. 20.Airbus's owners include Aerospatiale S.A. of France, DeutscheAerospace AG, British Aerospace PLC and ConstruccionesAeronauticas S.A. of Spain.   Airbus said it is now negotiating a new lease agreementwith Pan Am that would give Airbus more protection. But ifthe U.S. carrier can't meet the terms, Airbus said it wouldfind new lessees for the aircraft. The fate of two A-310s PanAm has on order isn't known, Airbus said.   Meanwhile, the $34 million probably will be tied up inChapter 11 proceedings for some time. Pan Am's managingdirector for sales, John Jackson, said in Paris that thebankruptcy judge on the case didn't think Airbus would beentitled to the same payment exemption as other foreigncreditors because Airbus's business ties to the U.S. are sogreat. Usually, foreign creditors aren't subject to U.S.bankruptcy law, which freezes all payments to creditors --except for operating expenses -- until a reorganization planis set.   Airbus says it is keeping a close eye on other weakenedU.S. customers, namely Continental Airlines, Eastern Airlinesand Trans World Airlines. Eastern has been in bankruptcy-lawproceedings since early 1989. If Eastern goes intoliquidation, Airbus would have a debt exposure that isunsecured, the European concern said.   Continental, which joined the bankruptcy club last month,has 20 Airbuses on order, the first of which are due to bedelivered in 1993. But Airbus said that so far Continentalhas kept to its obligations. TWA isn't in bankruptcy, butAirbus officials privately say they are watching its everymove. The airline also has 20 Airbuses on order.   TWA declined to comment. Continental said only that itanticipates a long relationship with Airbus. Eastern saidAirbus's concerns, as an unsecured creditor, areunderstandable but that the airline is working to becomeprofitable.   Mideast carriers also are a source of concern. IraqiAirways' order for five planes has been frozen, and ordersfor 25 to 30 more from other Mideast carriers have beenthrown into doubt largely by political events.</TEXT></DOC>
