In doing so, he has stirred up a storm ofhis own.   After all, neighboring Texas -- a state that's bigger,better known and home to President Bush -- hasn't stepped upsecurity at its Capitol. Why should Arkansas?</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. McCuen set up metal detectors at two entryways andclosed the other three entrances to the building, which ismodeled after the Capitol in Washington, D.C. Now, anyonewithout an official Capitol identification badge must passthrough the detectors. &quot;Better safe than sorry,&quot; says Mr.McCuen.   But sorry is exactly how many now feel as they try toenter the Capitol. The ultra-sensitive detectors squawk atitems as tiny as zippers and wedding rings. While embarrassedvictims shed everything conceivably containing metal, linesas long as a block form on the sidewalk outside. &quot;People whoused to show up 15 minutes early to testify at our committeehearings are having to show up an hour early now,&quot; complainsstate Rep. Lloyd George.   Local journalists, who must pass through the detectorsunless they have badges, believe the move is more politicalthan protective. Column after critical column calls Mr.McCuen a Little Rock &quot;Barney Fife,&quot; after the self-importantdeputy in the Andy Griffith TV show.   Columnist Meredith Oakley of the Arkansas Democrat evensuggested that Mr. McCuen -- who last year was criticized fortaking a 10-day trip (at state expense) with two femalesubordinates -- might soon start strip searching all &quot;sweetyoung things&quot; trying to enter the Capitol.   Mr. McCuen says increased security is warranted becauseArkansas is home to some defense companies and has sent a lotof soldiers to the Mideast. As for Ms. Oakley's charge, hesays that if he did start strip searching all &quot;pretty youngwomen,&quot; she wouldn't have anything to worry about because&quot;she's not pretty or young.&quot; (Ms. Oakley says, &quot;I'm 39 andprobably not what he'd call pretty.&quot;)   Arkansas lawmakers, who recently approved a 12.5% rise inthe state sales tax, say the Iraqi leader may be the least oftheir worries. Says Rep. George: &quot;I'm not afraid of SaddamHussein. . . . I'm afraid of the taxpayers. . . .&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
