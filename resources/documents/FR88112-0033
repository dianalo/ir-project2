The Service's preferredalternative is new, resulting from public comments on the Final Plan, andcontains new information regarding an oil and gas potential within theRefuge; the Service reconsidered the Preferred Alternative and decidedto modify it. The modification, which reduces the amount of land proposedfor wilderness designation, is based on a combination of Alternatives Band E of the Final Plan. As a result, the Service is recommending thatapproximately 640,000 acres on the Alaska Peninsula Refuge be added tothe National Wilderness Preservation System.  Alternative B, with this modification, provides a high degree of resourceprotection and the greatest opportunity for achieving the purposes setforth in the Alaska Lands Act including conservation of fish and wildlifepopulations and habitats.  <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 5, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Walter O.
