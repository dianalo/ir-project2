The two had been backpacking through Latin America.   Julie Gold, spokeswoman for the Australian Embassy in Brasilia,Brazil, told The Associated Press military troops found the bodieson Dec. 7 near Puquio, 360 miles southeast of Lima, in an area ofthe Andes where Maoist Shining Path guerrillas are active.   Military officials said the victims were killed about Nov. 22,she said. It was not known if the two were going by bus through thearea or hitchhiking.   A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Lima, who demandedanonymity, said it had not been determined whether guerrillas orcommon criminals killed them and the matter was under investigation.   Ms. Gold identified the man as Paul David Linsdell, 25, ofMelbourne. The New Zealand Embassy in Lima identified the woman asVivienne Joy Barbour, 26, of Hamilton. Australia does not have anembassy in Peru.   Ms. Gold said Linsdell had been strangled and that the note wasfound near the bodies. The note indicated the two were killed bythe Shining Path, which often leaves similar notes next to theirvictims.   Neil Johnson of the New Zealand Embassy said the bodies werefound on the road between Puquio and Abancay, the same road where aGerman couple was taken from a bus and murdered by Shining Pathrebels in May.   Ms. Gold said Linsdell and Ms. Barbour had traveled togethersince June, and had gone to Mexico, Brazil and Bolivia beforecoming here. She said they had planned to fly from Lima to Londonthis month.   Ms. Gold said their remains would be returned home.   The government has declared the area around Puquio and Abancayan emergency zone and put it under military control to fightleftist insurgents.   The U.S. Embassy and other foreign embassies have issuedadvisories urging tourists not to travel to the emergency zones,which cover a third of the country and affect more than half ofPeru's 21 million people.   At least 20 foreigners, including tourists, aid workers and onejournalist, have been killed in terrorist violence since theShining Path launched its insurgency in 1980. Eight foreigners diedin June 1986 when rebels bombed the tourist train to Machu Picchu,the ancient citadel of the Incas near Cuzco.   The government says more than 17,000 people have died in theviolence the past nine years.</TEXT></DOC>
