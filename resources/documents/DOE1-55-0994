Exposureswere performed in a temperature-controlled waveguide that permitted continuousmonitoring of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of RF energy. At a Taof 32.2 C, the threshold SAR for elevating colonic temperature and theSAR resulting in a 1.0 C elevation in colonic temperature were, respectively,4.3 and 10.0 W/kg for the mouse and 0.69 and 1.9 W/kg for the hamster.At a Ta of 35 C, these values were 0.12 and 5.3 W/kg for the mouse and0.46 and 1.4 W/kg for the hamster. The SARs required to induce hyperthermiain the mouse and hamster at these relatively warm Ta's are considerablylower than those required at cooler Ta's of 20 to 3 C. Overall, the hamsterbecame hyperthermic at lower SARs than in the mouse. Ta's of 35 C andgreater are frequently encountered during heat waves in the summer months.</TEXT></DOC>
