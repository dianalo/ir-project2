This section generally applies toprohibited transactions involving welfare plans and nonqualified pensionplans, and provides for the assessment of penalties equal to specificedpercentages of the amount involved in the underlying prohibited transaction.This regulation establishes the procedural framework for such civil penalties.A separate document containing regulations which define the terms ``amountinvolved'' and ``correction'' under ERISA section 502(i) is also beingpublished today.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 26, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Susan E.

In section 502(i) of ERISA, Congressgranted the Secretary of Labor the authority to assess civil penaltiesagainst parties in interest with respect to prohibited transactions withwelfare plans and pension plans which are not ``qualified'' plans underthe Internal Revenue Code.\1\<NOTE/> That section of the Act provides that the amount of suchpenalty may not exceed 5 percent of the amount involved in the transactionexcept that if the transaction is not corrected within 90 days after noticefrom the Secretary, such penalty may be in an amount not more than 100percent of the amount involved. These final procedural rules provide foran administrative proceeding with respect to the assessment of the ERISAsection 502(i) sanction. A separate final regulation dealing with the definitionof the terms ``amount involved'' and ``correction'' is also being publishedtoday. As discussed in the supplementary information accompanying thatpublication, the Department of Labor (the Department) believes that adoptionof these regulations is necessary for the effective implementation of itsERISA enforcement program.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The excise tax provisions of sections 4941 and 4975 ofthe Internal Revenue Code impose similar penalties against disqualifiedpersons who engage in prohibited transactions with, respectively, privatefoundations and tax qualified benefit plans. A parallel provision of theFederal Employee Retirement System Act of 1986 assesses a similar penaltywith respect to prohibited transactions involving the Federal Thrift SavingsFund. <T3>See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 8477(e)(1)(B).On August 27, 1986, the Department published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> containing proposed regulations to establishprocedures for: (1) Notification to a party in interest that the Departmentintends to assess the penalty provided by section 502(i), (2) requestinga hearing with respect to the matter before an administrative law judge,and (3) an appeal of an administrative law judge's decision to the Secretaryor his delegate.The Department has published rules of practice and procedure for administrativehearings before the Office of Administrative Law Judges at 29 CFR Part18, 48 FR 32538 (1983). The proposed regulation presented for comment severalmodifications to the rules set forth in 29 CFR Part 18. The proposed modificationswere designed to maintain the maximum degree of uniformity with the rulesset forth in 29 CFR Part 18, consistent with the special characteristicsof proceedings under ERISA section 502(i). The final rules published hereinrelate specifically to proceedings under ERISA section 502(i) and are controllingto the extent they are inconsistent with any portion of 29 CFR Part 18.The following discussion summarizes the specific proposed modificationsto the rules in 29 CFR Part 18 and the major issues raised by the commentators,and explains the Department's reasons for adopting the final regulationspublished with this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">General</ITAG>The Applicability of these rules under ERISA section 502(i) is set forthat the outset of the procedural regulations (andSection; 2570.1). The definitionalsection (andSection; 2570.2) incorporates the basic adjudicatory principlesset forth at 29 CFR Part 18, but includes terms and concepts of specificrelevance to proceedings under ERISA section 502(i). In this respect itdiffers from its more general counterpart at andSection; 18.2 of this title.In particular, andSection; 2570.2(q) states that the term ``Secretary'' meansthe Secretary of Labor and includes various individuals to whom the Secretarymay delegate authority. This definition is not intended to suggest anylimitation on the authority which the Secretary has delegated to the AssistantSecretary for Pension and Welfare Benefits. By Order 1-87, 52 FR 13139(April 21, 1987), the Secretary has delegated most of his authority underERISA, including authority to make final decisions to assess the penaltyprovided under section 502(i), to the Assistant Secretary for Pension andWelfare Benefits. Thus, the Department contemplates that the duties assignedto the Secretary under the procedural regulation will in fact be dischargedby the Assistant Secretary for Pension and Welfare Benefits. The Department received no comments on this section and it will thereforebe published as proposed, except that, in response to a comment, as explainedbelow, a new subsection was added to define the term ``answer.'' <ITAG tagnum="84">Proceedings Before Administrative Law Judges</ITAG>The rules in 29 CFR Part 18 concerning the computation of time, pleadings,prehearing conferences and statements, and settlements are adopted in theseprocedures for adjudications under ERISA section 502(i). The Departmentproposed to republish andSection; 18.3 as andSection; 2570.3 in order to identifyhow the Department should be served in a 502(i) proceeding, but made nosubstantive modifications in the section. One commentator expressed concernthat, under the proposal, a section 502(i) proceeding could transpire anda default be entered without actual notice to the party in interest andwith no further recourse provided. Thus, that commentator suggested anamendment to andSection; 2570.3(d)(2) to provide that service of notice bycertified mail in 502(i) proceedings is complete only upon receipt by theaddressee, and that a return receipt from the addressee for a copy of anotice sent by certified mail should be prima facie evidence of the addressee'sreceipt of the notice. After careful consideration, the Department found no compelling reasonto depart from the service rule applicable to all department proceedings,and therefore decided to publish andSection; 2570.3(d) as proposed. The Departmentbelieves that the adoption of such a ``return receipt'' service rule wouldnot only be inconsistent with the Department's objective of providing expeditedsection 502(i) proceedings but such a rule would also enable an elusiveparty in interest to hamper the Department's efforts to initiate proceedings.However, the Dpartment has modified andSection; 2570.5 by adding a provisionwhich permits the administrative law judge to decline to enter a defaultjudgment where there is proof of defective notice.The proposed procedural regulation at andSection; 2570.3(e) specificallystated that there would be no formal requirements for pleadings in section502(i) proceedings. Thus, the proposed regulation did not set forth specificrequirements regarding the contents of either the notice issued by theDepartment initiating a section 502(i) proceeding or the contents of theanswer which must be filed with respect to the notice in order to avoida default judgment under proposed andSection; 2570.5. The Department received one comment letter regarding this aspect of theproposed regulation. The commentator suggested that the Department reviseproposed andSection; 2570.5 to describe explicitly the information that therespondent must include in the answer to the notice initiating a section502(i) proceeding. Further, the commentator stated that the Departmentshould describe in more detail the information that the section 502(i)notice must contain. After consideration, the Department has decided to provide additional guidanceto addressees as to how to respond to a 502(i) notice, similar to thatprovided by andSection; 18.5(d) for all other Department proceedings. TheDepartment found, however, that there was no reason to elaborate on thegeneral procedural definition of the document which initiates the proceeding,whether it is called ``notice'' or ``complaint.'' <T3>Compare </T3>29 CFR 18.2(d) <T3>and </T3>29 CFR 2570.2(c) (as proposed). Accordingly, andSection; 2570.3will be published in final as proposed, but the final regulation at 29CFR 2570.2(c) now provides that the definition of ``answer'' as set outin 29 CFR 18.5(d)(2) applies to responses in prohibited transaction penaltyproceedings. A section on the consequences of default (andSection; 2570.5) has been includedin these rules to indicate that unless the respondent invokes the adjudicatoryprocedures under ERISA section 502(i) within 30 days after it is informedof the intention of the Department to assess a civil sanction under ERISAsection 502(i), the assessment of that penalty will become final. Althoughthe Department received no comments specifically referring to this proposal,the Department has decided, as discussed above, to add a provision to andSection;2570.5(a) which will permit the administrative law judge to set aside adefault where there is proof of defective notice. Proposed andSection; 2570.6, respecting consent orders and settlements, specifiedtime periods within which parties must: (1) Request the deferral of a hearingto permit the negotiation of a settlement; (2) submit a proposed consentagreement; or (3) file objections to proposed settlement agreements. Thesection also proposed that the administrative law judge's decision shallinclude the terms and conditions of any consent order or settlement whichhas been agreed to by the parties and proposed that the decision of theadministrative law judge which incorporates such consent order shall becomefinal agency action within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 704. The Department received one comment on this section which suggested (1)that the time limitations for settlement purposes in proposed andSection;2570.6 (a) and (c) should be eliminated in favor of committing the issueto the discretion of the presiding administrative law judge, and (2) thatthe administrative law judge should also have the authority to grant extensionsof time for a party to object to a proposed settlement greater than the15 day limit proposed in andSection; 2570.6(e). The Department recognizes that the proposed time limitations place a certaindegree of constraint on all parties to a 502(i) proceeding. However, aftercareful review, the Department has decided to maintain the section as proposedbecause the time limits are reasonable and in keeping with the goal ofthe Department to conduct section 502(i) proceedings on an expedited basis.Section 2570.7 proposed that discovery may be ordered by the administrativelaw judge only upon a showing of good cause by the party seeking discovery.This differs from the more expansive standard for discovery contained in29 CFR 18.14. Proposed andSection; 2570.7 stated that in cases in which discoveryis ordered by the administrative law judge, the order shall expressly limitthe scope and terms of discovery to that for which good cause has beenshown. The Department received two comments on this section. One commentator supportedthe limitation on discovery so that 502(i) proceedings would not become``fishing expeditions'' but would be limited to determining the singleissue of whether a civil penalty should be assessed for a specific prohibitedtransaction. Another commentator objected strongly to the proposed regulation's departurefrom the more expansive discovery standard set forth in 29 CFR 18.14. Thiscommentator stated that the departure was ``unwarranted and an infringementon due process,'' and that the proposed regulation's approach to discoverywould put the parties to the proceeding ``on an unequal footing, with theDepartment having the clear advantage.'' Further, the commentator suggestedthat by limiting discovery, the Department was attempting to ``stack thedeck'' in its own favor by rejecting a ``discovery practice that is animportant and useful element of the federal judicial system.'' After careful consideration, the Department has decided to reformulateandSection; 2570.7 to provide a less stringent standard for discovery insection 502(i) proceedings than that proposed, but one which is still consistentwith the Department's overall objective of establishing a streamlined procedure.The final regulation continues to require that a party seeking discoverymust obtain an order of the administrative law judge and that the orderexpressly limit the scope and terms of discovery to that for which ``goodcause'' has been shown. The standard of ``good cause,'' however, is notdefined as requiring a showing that the discovery requested relates toa genuine issue as to a material fact that is relevant to the proceeding.Finally, consistent with andSection; 18.14, the standard proposed in andSection;2570.7(a) remains applicable to discovery requests for materials preparedin anticipation of or for the hearing by another party's representative.The section on expedited proceedings (andSection; 2570.9) proposed that thescheduling and disposition of all section 502(i) cases shall be on an expeditedbasis. Under the counterpart section of Part 18 of the title, andSection;18.42, expedited treatment of a case generally occurs only at the requestof a party and at the discretion of the administrative law judge. As withthe Department's proposed regulation on discovery in section 502(i) proceedings,two commentators did not agree on this section. One commentator supportedthe proposed requirement that section 502(i) proceedings be heard on anexpedited basis, stating that where transactions are ongoing, it is ineveryone's best interest to resolve the matter quickly. The other commentatorfelt that there was no apparent justification for the proposal and thatit would create an advantage for the Department. That commentator alsosuggested that if andSection; 2570.9 was retained, it ought to specify howthe procedures are to be expedited. Upon further reflection, the Department has determined that the existingprocedures in 29 CFR Part 18 provide for sufficiently timely processingand thus it is not necessary to mandate that every section 502(i) proceedingbe heard on an expedited basis. Therefore, the proposed section 2570.9has been deleted, and the procedures embodied in 29 CFR 18.42 will governrequests by any party for expedited treatment in a section 502(i) proceeding.As a general matter, however, the Department anticipates requesting expeditedtreatment under such procedures in section 502(i) proceedings. Becauseof the deletion, proposed andSection;andSection; 2570.10-2510.12 have beenrenumbered accordingly. <ITAG tagnum="84">Appeals </ITAG>The proposed sections on appeals (andSection;andSection; 2570.10-2570.12) provideda twenty day period in which any party to a section 501(i) proceeding mayseek review of an administrative law judge decision by the Secretary orhis delegate. The Secretary has delegated his authority with respect tothese appellate procedures to the Assistant Secretary for Pension and WelfareBenefits. The proposed regulations provided for a review of the administrativerecord made before the administrative law judge, supplemented by briefs.Under proposed andSection; 2570.12(b), the Secretary or his delegate, mayaffirm, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, the decision on appeal.The Department received one comment letter regarding appeals. The commentatorargued that the delegation of the Secretary's authority over appeals tothe Assistant Secretary would make the appeals procedures a ``meaninglesswaste of time'' and queried whether, in the final analysis, a respondentcould expect the Assistant Secretary, whose staff issues a section 502(i)notice and conducts the investigation leading to the proceeding, to overrulethe decision of an administrative law judge imposing the penalty. In response, the Department notes that under the APA, an agency may exerciseadjudicatory authority and supervise enforcement activity so long as thosepersons involved in the prosecutorial function and those persons involvedin the adjudicatory function report to the agency head by a separate chainof authority. The Secretary has established the Pension and Welfare BenefitsAdministration (PWBA) within the Department for the purpose of carryingout most of the Secretary's responsibilities under ERISA, and has designatedthe Assistant Secretary as agency head for purposes of ERISA enforcement.<T3>See</T3> Secretary's Order 1-87, 52 FR 1319 (April 21, 1987). Thus,the Assistant Secretary may lawfully oversee the prosecution of 502(i)assessments and review the administrative law judge decisions so long asthe two functions are separately maintained within the PWBA. Therefore,the Department sees no legal impediment to the appeal process as drafted.The Department also believes that all parties will benefit from havingappeals heard by an official with expertise in ERISA matters. The Departmenthas therefore decided to publish in final, as proposed, the provision whichprovides for an appeal to the Secretary or his designee. The Department received one final comment which argued that the regulationsshould be amended to provide that section 502(i) proceedings be stayedin the event a related case is filed in district court prior to the issuanceof a notice commencing a section 502(i) administrative proceeding or inthe event a related case is filed after a section 502(i) administrativeproceeding has been commenced. In response, the Department has decided that because the statute does nottie the two types of actions together, it is not appropriate to do so byregulation. Specifically, because commencement of one action does not tollthe statute of limitations with respect to the other, the statute clearlycontemplates that a section 502(i) administrative proceeding can proceedconcurrently with a civil action brought under section 502(i) of ERISA.The Department sees no reason to alter the dual system provided by thestatute. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibiity Act</ITAG>The Regulatory Flexibility Act imposes certain requirements with respectto rules which would have a significant impact on a substantial numberof small entities. A``rule'' under the Regulatory Flexibilty Act is onefor which a general notice of proposed rulemaking is required under section553(b) of the Administrative Procedure Act. Under section 553(b) of theAdministrative Procedure Act a general notice of proposed rulemaking isnot required for rules of agency organization, procedure or practice. Thus,such rules are excluded from the definition of ``rule'' under the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. Since this procedural regulation is a rule of agency procedureor practice it is thus not subject to the requirements of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department has determined that this regulatory action would not consititutea ``major rule'' as that term is used in Executive Order 12291 becausethe action does not result in: An annual effect on the economy of $100million; a major increase in costs of prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies, or geographic regions; or significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreignbased enterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Paperwork Reduction Act mandates that agencies provide data with respectto information collection requirements which may be imposed by certainregulatory action. Section 3518(c)(1)(B) of the Paperwork Reduction Actprovides that the requirements of that Act do not apply to administrativeactions involving specific individuals or entities. The Department hasdetermined that the administrative adjudications which would be conductedpursuant to the procedures contained in this regulation fall within thescope of this exemption from the Paperwork Reduction Act.<ITAG tagnum="84">Statutory Authority</ITAG>The regulation is adopted pursuant to the authority contained in section502 and 505 of ERISA (Pub. L. 93-406, 88 Stat. 892, 894; 29 U.S.C. 1132,1135), and Secretary's Order 1-87, 52 FR 13139 (April 21, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2570</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Employee benefit plans, EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act, Party in interest, Law enforcement, Pensions,Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Prohibited transactions.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulation</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Subchapter G of Chapter XXV ofTitle 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 2570_PROCEDURAL REGULATIONS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOMESECURITY ACT</ITAG>By adding in the appropriate place the following new part:<ITAG tagnum="75">Subpart A_Procedures For The Assessment of Civil Sanctions Under ERISASection 502(i) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.1 Scope of rules.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.2 Definitions.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.3 Service: Copies of documents and pleadings.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.4 Parties.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.5 Consequences of default.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.6 Consent order or settlement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.7 Scope of Discovery.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.8 Summary decision.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.9 Decision of the administrative law judge.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.10 Review by the Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.11 Scope of review.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">2570.12 Procedures for review by the Secretary.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Section 502(i) and 505 of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1132(i)1135, and Secretary's Order 1-87, 52 FR 13139 (April 21, 1987).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart A_Procedures for the Assessment of Civil Sanctions Under ERISASection 502(i)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 2570.1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Scope of rules.</ITAG>The rules of practice set forth in this part are applicable to ``prohibitedtransaction penalty proceedings'' (as defined in andSection; 2570.2(o) ofthis part) under section 502(i) of the Employee Retirement Income SecurityAct of 1974.
