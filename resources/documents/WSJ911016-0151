The proposed stock issue is part of a sweeping plan byOwens-Illinois to reduce the debt taken on in a 1987leveraged buyout. It also marks the latest in a flurry ofmajor stock offerings arranged by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co., the big leveraged buy-out firm that controlsOwens-Illinos, a Toledo, Ohio, maker of glass and plasticbottles.</LP><TEXT>   In the past six months, KKR has either completed orannounced stock sales by five companies that it controls,including RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp., Duracell InternationalInc. and Stop andamp; Shop Cos. Proceeds from those offerings havealmost all been used to reduce debt.   As proposed, Owens-Illinois would sell 60 million shareswithin a price range of $13 to $16 each. That would raise$780 million to $960 million; at the midpoint price of $14.50a share, Owens-Illinois would raise $870 million.   Even at the low end of its range, the Owens-Illinoisoffering would exceed this year's largest initial publicoffering to date: a $689 million issue last January by MBNACorp., a credit-card company. The only larger going-publicissue this year was a $1.13 billion offering by NuveenInsured Municipal Fund, a closed-end mutual bond fund.   &quot;Given the strength in the equity markets and what KKR hasbeen doing with other companies, everyone had suspected thatsomething like this would happen,&quot; said Joseph Stivaletti, ananalyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;There's been a real push tode-leverage companies.&quot;   While Owens-Illinois has posted improved results duringthe past 18 months, it hasn't been regarded as one of thebrightest stars in KKR's portfolio. Bottle-industry saleshave stagnated the past few years, forcing Owens-Illinois toundertake intensive cost-cutting to increase its operatingprofit margins.   For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Owens-Illinoisreported earnings from continuing operations of $20.9 millionon revenue of $2.66 billion. Interest expense on thecompany's $2.96 billion in debt largely consumed its $452.9million in earnings before interest and taxes during thatperiod.   In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission,however, Owens-Illinois painted a much brighter financialpicture had it gone public as of Jan. 1. The company said itsinterest expense would have been shrunk by nearly one-thirdduring the first nine months of 1991, producing after-taxearnings from continuing operations of $88 million, or 91cents a share.   That pro forma calculation assumes that Owens-Illinois hadcompleted its public offering and that the company hadretired about $1 billion of high-yielding junk bonds byreplacing them with new, loweryielding senior notes. In itsSEC filing, Owens-Illinois said it soon plans to file a $1billion offering of senior notes, which would yield anestimated 10.5%.   Owens-Illinois currently has more than $2 billion of junkbonds outstanding, with yields ranging from 12 5/8% to morethan 15%. Those rates are &quot;way too high&quot; for the company'sliking, Kidder Peabody's Mr. Stivaletti observed.   Various investment partnerships controlled by KKR paid $5a share for their Owens-Illinois stock in 1987. Thus, if theOwens-Illinois offering is completed as proposed, KKR wouldshow sizable paper profits on its holdings.   At the midpoint price of $14.50 a share, the KKR groupwould have nearly tripled its money in less than five years,showing paper returns of 25% to 30% a year, investmentbankers say. That isn't as high as the 40% to 60% annualprofits that KKR averaged during its peak dealmaking years inthe mid-1980s, but still is significantly ahead of stockmarket averages.   The Owens-Illinois underwriting is being led by MorganStanley andamp; Co. Neither KKR nor Owens-Illinois management areselling any shares. Because of the issuance of new shares,though, KKR's stake in Owens-Illinois, currently about 90%,would be cut to 36% on a fully diluted basis if the offeringis completed as scheduled.</TEXT></DOC>
