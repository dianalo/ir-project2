Every day is EarthDay at the site, which the heavy-equipment maker uses todemonstrate its bulldozers, wheel loaders and other giantyellow machines. (Once or twice a decade, the company alsoholds its big Power Parade at the area; thousands come towatch a mammoth demonstration of Cat machines weighing asmuch as 100 tons.)   But besides customers and special visitors, the site hasalso been attracting uninvited guests: poachers stalking deerin the surrounding woods. So a Cat service technicianproposed making the whole area part of the state'sacres-for-wildlife program. The designation allows Cat topost &quot;Illinois Acres for Wildlife&quot; above its &quot;No Trespassing&quot;signs, telling poachers they are doubly unwelcome.   Max Runkle, a district wildlife biologist for the state,was skeptical at first. The preservation program, created torecognize landowners who set aside property for wildlife,usually is used by farmers.   But Mr. Runkle says a tour of the site convinced him thatCat was a worthy recipient of the designation. As if on cue,half a dozen deer showed up at the side of the road. He sayshe found much of Cat's property &quot;a basic panorama ofMidwestern Illinois,&quot; with woods and fields flowing over thehilly terrain.   As for the diesel fumes wafting through those hills, thebiologist says Cat's demo activity isn't &quot;ongoing orintensive.&quot; And he and company officials also point out thatthe demonstration area is only about 15% of the 700 acres Catowns.   Because ground clawed bare by earth-moving equipment tendsto erode, Cat digs ponds at low spots in the area to collectthe runoff. It then moves the recaptured dirt back to thedemo site. &quot;A lot of people think our tractors just tear upthe earth, but Cat machines do a lot to enhance theenvironment, too,&quot; a company official asserts in an employeenewsletter heralding the wildlife designation.   And what about the noise?   Tom Potts, the Cat technician who suggested thewildlife-acres idea, says the deer don't seem to mind. &quot;Theyget used to heavy equipment. As long as you don't botherthem, they stand out and watch you.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
