Southeastern Connecticut and New York's Long Island will continue to head the list of the nation's most affluent metropolitan areas at the beginning of the 1990s, says Sales andamp; Marketing Management magazine. The magazine's annual Survey of Buying Power says Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk-Danbury, Conn., will have an average household income in 1990 of $71,628, the highest of any U.S. metro area. That's a 41% increase over the Connecticut area's income level in 1985.    No. 2 on the magazine's list is Nassau-Suffolk, N.Y., the two counties that comprise Long Island, with estimated 1990 average income of $67,595. Third is Lake County, Ill., near Chicago, at $66,111.    Now brace yourself. The fourth most-affluent community on the magazine's list is in North Dakota. Grand Forks, N.D., home of the University of North Dakota, a major Air Force base, and some of the nation's richest farming country, will have average household income in 1990 of $63,231, according to the survey. Washington, D.C., is the magazine's projected No. 5 at $62,273.    Grand Forks residents are perplexed to learn they're so well off. (The magazine survey puts the area's 1985 average income at $41,988.) Bob Bushfield, Grand Forks planning director, says the Pentagon pumps in lots of money to support strategic bombers and missiles, and he notes that local farmers, with well-diversified crops, have largely escaped the agricultural recession. But he adds, &quot;If you were to come out here, you wouldn't think we're going to be No. 4, I'll tell you that.&quot;    Robert Korvach, a University of North Dakota economics professor, says the local economy is barely holding its own, with nothing in sight to justify a personal-income boom. &quot;I have absolutely no faith in their methodology,&quot; he says of the income survey. The high rank for Grand Forks is &quot;a statistical aberration.&quot;    Not so, replies Robert Katz, senior vice president for market statistics at Bill Communications Inc., New York, compiler of the metro income figures. He says the survey, which is widely quoted in the sales and marketing industries, uses Census, Internal Revenue Service, and state-government data to rank local areas.    Mr. Katz notes, for example, that a handful of wealthy people in a small population center such as Grand Forks can significantly push up the average income figure. Eliminate the wealth bias by using a median income figure -- the middle point among incomes of all households in the area -- and Grand Forks still doesn't look too shabby. Current median income there is $29,483, which puts the North Dakota town 31st among 317 U.S. metro areas.    &quot;We have a lot of consistent evidence indicating that Grand Forks is quite a wealthy area and will continue to be one based on trends we've seen for the past five years,&quot; Mr. Katz says.    ---   GM'S MIDWEST PLANT CLOSINGS may not hurt local government credit ratings after all. Since last fall, when General Motors Corp. announced the phased shutdown of nine assembly lines in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri and Ohio, Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. has been calculating the impact of the closings on the creditworthiness of the affected states, counties and cities.    &quot;The impact isn't as severe as we anticipated it might be,&quot; says Peter D'Erchia, an Sandamp;P vice president. &quot;At this point in our analysis, nobody is impacted severely enough to warrant a rating change.&quot; The relocation of certain jobs in the same area, and the fact that layoffs aren't coming all at once, make the closings somewhat easier for localities to swallow, he says.    A credit-rating downgrade translates into higher borrowing costs when a government raises money in the municipal bond market. In addition to the four states, Sandamp;P has been looking at the bond ratings of Chicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati and Detroit, plus five other Michigan localities, in connection with the GM closings.    ---   WATCHING THE MOVING VANS is one way to get a feel for interstate migration. Chicago-based Allied Van Lines Inc. ranks state-by-state migration based on the company's 160,000 household moves nationwide. Last year, Allied counted 14 &quot;magnet&quot; states, its term for a state where 55% or more of the company's residential moves are inbound.    The top magnet areas in 1986 were Hawaii, Alaska, District of Columbia, Georgia, Arizona and Rhode Island. Nearly three-fourths of Allied's Hawaii business consisted of moves to the islands. Allied also counts states where there's a marked exodus. For the third year in a row, North Dakota had the highest percentage of Allied's outbound moves. Other states with a high share of outbound households were Iowa, Wyoming, Louisiana and West Virginia.    ---   HEMEN EUSKERA IRAKASTEN EA. The University of Nevada, Reno, has the nation's only Basque studies program, a legacy of the Basque sheep-herding community that helped pioneer the state. Other uncommon languages taught at Western universities include Burmese at the University of Hawaii; Uzbek at the University of California at Los Angeles; Irish Gaelic at Stanford University, and Welsh at Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah. The language inventory is included in a catalog of foreign studies programs at Western colleges published by the Western Interstate Commission on Higher Education, Boulder, Colo. </TEXT></DOC>
