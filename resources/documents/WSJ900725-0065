Participants cautioned that differences on taxes andspending cuts remain wide and that it will be difficult tobridge them before Congress leaves for its August recess.</LP><TEXT>   But an exchange of plans between the Bush administrationand congressional Democrats could be a significant stepforward. Negotiators also agreed to &quot;a code of conduct&quot; thatforbids them from talking publicly about the details of theirdiscussions, another hint that the talks may finally bechanging character after more than two months.   Democrats and Republicans both warned there has been nobreakthrough yet. House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D.,Mo.) said negotiators were making &quot;incremental progress.&quot; HisRepublican counterpart, Rep. Robert Michel of Illinois, said:&quot;I thought I was a patient person. But I'm getting awfullyimpatient. Nothing's happened.&quot;   President Bush and top congressional Democrats, meanwhile,negotiated a cease-fire in an attempt to save the budgetsummit, but Mr. Bush promptly took to the campaign trail tocriticize Democrats as big spenders.   &quot;There is a general consensus that we need to concentrateon reducing the partisan comments,&quot; House Speaker ThomasFoley (D., Wash.) said after meeting with Mr. Bush and othercongressional leaders. White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwaterconfirmed that both sides agreed &quot;that they would try to keepthe rhetoric under control and really try to make this aproductive week.&quot;   But within hours, in remarks prepared for delivery to NewYork Republicans, Mr. Bush said that &quot;to deal with a DemocratCongress is to often face government by gridlock -- withspending skyrocketing out of control, good legislation thrownaside for pork and a budget deficit looming over ourchildren's children.&quot;   Earlier in the day, speaking to Pennsylvania Republicansin Philadelphia, the president alternated between his rolesas party leader and head of state. In his prepared text, hedeclared that when the two parties' philosophies on taxes,spending and education are compared, &quot;our side wins.&quot;   &quot;As long as spending runs out of control in Congress,&quot; headded, &quot;the American people will pay the price.&quot;   But he inserted more conciliatory remarks, some writtenand some ad libbed, expressing hope that the budget deadlockcan be broken. &quot;I salute those Democrats in the leadershipwho are now working with me . . . trying to achieve abipartisan agreement that we all can live with that would begood for our country.&quot;   Mr. Bush is to meet with congressional leaders again thismorning, and summit negotiators plan to reconvene thisafternoon. The two sides are seeking a package of taxincreases and spending cuts to shrink the deficit by $50billion for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.</TEXT></DOC>
