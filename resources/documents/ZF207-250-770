(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By John PallattoandM;PC users today need tools that give them flexible access to host databases.andO;In the past, they had to put up with primitive micro-to-mainframe softwarethat allowed them to do little more than turn their PCs into dumb terminalsfor simple file transfers, downloading mountains of raw statistics from thehost.andM;Many early products, released between 1984 and 1986, did not help usersconvert mainframe data into formats acceptable to their favorite PCspreadsheets or databases.andP;  As a result, users had to rekey and edit theirdata even after they transferred it to their PCs.andM;Things have changed.andP;  Developers of micro-to-mainframe data-extractionsoftware are introducing products that respond to users' needs.andP;  The latestsoftware on the market lets users be more selective about the quantity andtype of data extracted from host databases.andP;  Some of the products automatethe extraction, allowing data to go directly from the host into a PC softwarepackage.andM;The distinguishing feature of micro-to-mainframe products listed in thisbuyers' guide is their ability to access and manipulate data in the format inwhich it exists on the mainframe.andM;In February, Cone Software Laboratory Inc. of Upland, Pa., introduced itsXtra PC version 1.3.andP;  The product allows users to select data from themainframe and transfer it into Lotus 1-2-3 or any PC software package thatsupports the Lotus .PRN file format, comma-separated values or ASCII textfiles and database flat files.andP;  It is priced at $295.andM;''Our target audience is end users.andP;  It's not intended to be a power user'stool, so it was designed with ease of use in mind,'' said David Hastings,Cone Software's president.andM;Xtra PC allows users to select data fields from any mainframe screen that canbe displayed on a PC monitor, he explained.andP;  The software does not take''snapshots'' of entire mainframe screens, Hastings said.andM;Rather, it allows users to specify rows and columns of data within amainframe database.andP;  This feature makes it easier to select and organize thedata so it can be loaded into a PC software package, Hastings said.andM;Campbell Soup Co., in Camden, N.J., beta tested Xtra PC to see if it wouldfree PC users from asking the information-systems department to reformat andtransfer files from mainframe databases, explained Stuart Harris, an MISproject manager at Campbell.andP;  ''So far, the results have been verypositive,'' Harris said.andM;Sales analysts at the company use the product to retrieve information fromthe mainframe and load it into Lotus 1-2-3 or Harvard Graphics packages forsales forecasting or comparing forecasts against results stored on themainframe, Harris said.andP;  Xtra PC has also made it easier for the auditors andanalysts in the company's finance department to file, update and correctreports, Harris said.andM;''The financial people feel the system gives them more flexibility and morecontrol over what they are doing,'' Harris said, because they don't have tocall on the information-systems department for file transfers or updates.andM;Cone Software followed Campbell's recommendation that the user interface bekept simple to allow users to run nearly all program functions from a singlemain menu, he said.andP;  ''Users don't get lost in a program if they only haveone main menu to deal with.''andM;Another data-extraction package, Micro DecisionWare Inc.'s PC/SQL Link, isdesigned to make it easier for users to access data stored on mainframeStructured Query Language (SQL) databases, according to Margaret Devere,communications manager for the Boulder, Colo., firm.andM;The PC/SQL Link helps PC users manage SQL queries to mainframe SQL databasesand create and save SQL requests.andP;  It sends requests to a host database forexecution, monitors the status of the requests and returns extracted files tothe PC.andP;  The program is designed to minimize the SQL commands and syntaxneeded to extract data, but supports both knowledgeable SQL users andnovices, Devere said.andM;PC/SQL Link displays menus that execute specific SQL functions, includingselect, load, insert, update and delete.andM;Increased IndependenceandM;In March, Micro DecisionWare announced a number of enhancements to theproduct, including support for IBM's DB2 running under the MVS/CICS operatingenvironment and the IBM LU 6.2 Advanced Program-to-Program Communicationsprotocol.andP;  These features expand the host environments that users can accesswith PCs and make users less dependent upon their data-processing departmentsand expensive time-sharing resources, Devere said.andM;Coors Brewing Co., in Golden, Colo., uses PC/SQL Link to collect and formatdata that will become part of an executive-support system, explained AlanAlper, manager of end-user computing at Coors.andM;For example, users can collect data from a human-resources database runningon an IBM AS/400 and transfer it to an SQL database called the Coors BusinessInformation Library running on an IBM 3090 mainframe.andP;  The data can then beaccessed by stand-alone or LAN PCs to do such tasks as creating anddisplaying corporate organizational charts.andM;The link software allows Coors to maintain a single repository of data thatcan be accessed by PCs, rather than having PC users access data from severaldifferent databases, Alper said.andP;  It also allows the company to standardizeon a consistent interface for these databases.andM;General Mills, in Minneapolis, has found that PC/SQL Link is successful inhelping PC users automate the generation and execution of SQL queries to thecompany's mainframe databases, according to Allen Richwine, an end-usercomputing specialist with the firm.andM;The software helps users format SQL requests by maintaining on the PC a listof the mainframe data catalogue, Richwine noted.andP;  This allows the PC todisplay a list of all the tables and columns a user needs to select the datahe or she wants to extract from the mainframe.andP;  Once the query is formattedand sent to the mainframe, it will automatically retrieve the data anddownload it to the PC, he said.andM;All the commands related to logging into host databases are automated and canbe configured to work with whatever security clearances are enforced, hesaid.andP;  Another significant advantage is that a query can be stored for reuse,he said, and can be customized constantly to serve changing needs.andP;  The querycan also include specialized prompts that users must respond to before thequery is sent to the mainframe.andM;For example, if the same query is run every month, the user can be promptedto supply the month name rather than being forced to rewrite the query justto correct the month name, according to Richwine.andM;The product costs $19,000 for the first mainframe license, and $295 to $595per license on the PC, depending upon quantity.andP;  It also supports a widerange of file formats beyond the ubiquitous Lotus and dBASE formats.andM;Another new product, Now!, from Attachmate Corp. of Bellevue, Wash., isdesigned to make it easier for users to access mainframe software by usingstandard 3270 terminal-emulation software, said Tim Fisher, Attachmate'smarketing services manager.andP;  Now! consists of about 40 English-languagemacros that Attachmate calls ''autoware.'' Fisher said that the macros act asa front end to queries that are transmitted to IBM mainframes through thehigh-level language application program interface (HLLAPI).andM;According to Fisher, each macro automates a specific function ofmicro-to-mainframe connectivity.andP;  Upload and Download macros controlfile-transfer functions.andP;  The Connect macro will automatically log a PC ontoa mainframe.andM;Users can select a series of Now! macro functions to automate a complicatedmicro-to-mainframe session, Fisher explained.andP;  With the menus, users canselect macro functions, for example, to log into several different mainframefiles, extract a selection of data and transfer it to a PC file format thatcan be loaded into a spreadsheet application.andM;Mike New, Attachmate's vice president of marketing, contends thatnon-programmers can write their own autoware programs.andP;  ''I don't think theaverage PC users would do it, but some would,'' New said.andM;Writing Now! macros, he said, is still easier for experienced programmersthan trying to use high-level languages like COBOL to write HLLAPIapplications.andM;There are two Now! versions.andP;  The author's version costs $595 and includesall the software and documentation required to write Now! programs, includingan encryption utility to secure the files.andM;The user's version, which costs $195, can only run Now! programs and cannotbe used to modify or decrypt programs.andM;New screen- and report-handling capabilities have been added to IsomorphicSystems Inc.'s Iso*Form data-extraction software.andP;  The new version, which wasreleased in January, allows Iso*Form users to build data-extraction and-transfer screens on the PC, according to Richard Berg, Isomorphic's vicepresident.andM;Screens generated on the PC using Isomorphic's Universal Screen InterfaceSystem can be run without modification on IBM mainframes, he said.andP;  In thepast, such screens had to be generated on the mainframe, he noted, and couldnot be created on the PC and transported to the mainframe.andM;Iso*Form is designed to allow non-technical PC users to select data from IBMmainframe VSAM files using existing COBOL or PL/1 data definitions, Bergexplained.andP;  While users could also create their own data definitions, theywould be more likely to do this with the help of a programmer, he added.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
